1,The Top 5 Trip-Hop Albums Of All Time,arts-entertainment," Slow, chilled-out beats, haunting vocals, and eclectic samples are all hallmarks of the funk, reggae, and hip-hop influenced brand of electronic music that came to be known as trip-hop. Originating in Bristol, a city located in the South West of England, trip-hop quickly captured worldwide attention, spawned some global superstars, and influenced generations of artists to come. But which trip-hop albums are regarded as the best of the bunch? Let’s take a look at 5 commonly cited classics and give you the chance to check them out for yourself. Massive Attack’s Blue Lines (1991) is one of the most prominent - and one of the first - albums of the trip-hop genre. Unlike many of the subsequent trip-hop albums released, Massive Attack’s tracks captured the darker edge of electronic music, permeated by scratchy sampling and haunting electro elements that give the album a sense of disquiet against the chilled out backing. Blue Lines was an unquestionably influential album, fusing a wide breadth of Black genres including rap, hip hop, reggae, and soul with a dark electro twist. The intro track Safe From Harm is a jarring opening to the album, with an agitated baseline riﬀ and edgy rap verses that complement Nelson’s haunting vocals of ‘If you hurt what’s mine, I’ll sure as hell retaliate’. There is a sense of suspense throughout the song, amplified by the twitchy electric guitar that sets this track apart from the typical trip-hop feel. This disconcerting feel is amplified by the bluesy melancholia of One Love, which combines catchy repetition with the soulful male vocals of reggae roots singer Horace Andy. Its minimalist approach eﬀectively creates a melodic ambience that is darkly atmospheric. Be Thankful For What You’ve Got lifts the album to a chill-out vibe with a touch of soul and a bouncy bassline that harmonises perfectly with the vocals. There are electronic elements throughout the track, but this is a complement more than a feature, not detracting from the heart of the melody. This track is classic, memorable, and adds a touch of lightness to the album which adds yet another layer to the complexity of Massive Attack’s music. Blue Lines is a fundamental foundation of the trip-hop category, and a complex and skilful approach to combining genres. This 1997 classic by Smoke City is an addictive fusion of trip-hop and acid jazz, expertly combining hypnotic Latin American beats with the seductively smoky female vocals of singer Nina Miranda and a modern electro twist. The most notable track of the album is, of course, the classic Underwater Love, which features the exotic percussive rhythms of Brazilian samba, and dreamy electric guitar. The electro elements are mellow and rounded, giving the bubbling sensation of being underwater, while the included samples of rainforest sounds transport the listener to a tropical paradise. Miranda’s vocals are instrumental in grounding the experience and providing the focus for the eclectic mix of trip-hop and jazz elements. This deliciously sensuous first song is perfectly juxtaposed against the next track, Devil Mood, which is dark and delicious, the deep, booming drums sending deep roots into the soul of the melody. Whereas the electronic elements of Underwater Love are fluidly melodic, in Devil Mood they adopt a new persona: glitchy and hard, bringing a sense of dark futurism that brings the classically Latin beats into the modern age. This is then lifted by the light and breezy With You, in which Miranda’s versatile voice becomes gently lilting - the strings creating a sense of soaring through blue skies, the just-there rhythms leaving you wanting more. This rollercoaster of an album guides you through an addictive concoction of blue skies and the deepest depths of ocean and earth, floating and tumbling through the elements. Their style is eclectic and unmistakable: creating a classic trip-hop album that has lasted throughout the decades. This is a dreamy, sultry album that is a perfect complement for balmy summer nights! The aptly-named Smokers Delight has been a stoner classic since its release in 1995, and is a playful take on the trip-hop genre, with heady reggae, funk, and Latin beats lifted to a light and airy buzz by echoey sample tracks and techno elements. Their use of vocals is a light touch, placing most emphasis on their creative use of percussion, funky bass, and electronic components. Smokers Delight is a delightfully chilled genre mash-up that comprises multiple layers which play together harmoniously and in a deceptively simple manner. It is the perfect go-to for a chill-out album – there’s just enough interest to keep the listener hooked, while the sounds do not require involved listening. This laid-back, sunny set is a lasting classic of the trip-hop genre; a smooth, sweet delight of an album, leaving the listener with a taste of pina colada on the beach in their mouth and the feeling of sunlight on their skin. Kid Loco’s sumptuously mellow album brings a fun and unique approach to the trip-hop genre, hitting a sweet spot with a heady blend of chill out and psychedelia. The near-namesake track A Grand Love Theme is smooth and nostalgic, and it glides like a plane on a stream of airy strings. This soothing soundscape is perfectly complemented by the audio samples, which break up the repetition and ground the track. Deep male vocals then add a richness to the airy backing. The breathy vocals of Katrina Mitchell are featured on Love Me Sweet, which is a sweet dream of a song, carrying you away on a cloud of twanging sitar and playful xylophone. The rhythms are consistently chilled but intriguingly varied and almost trance-like, sinking the listener into a deep state of relaxation. Sister Curare adds a darker and deeper feel to the album, with an opening audio sample narrating a spate of bank robberies in 1979. The clashing piano keys, experimental guitar and sax, and interspersed audio samples create an eclectic feel, which is streamlined by the consistent drum loops. This chaotic track seems at first to be at odds with the rest of the album, but in fact, it provides variety, keeping you on your toes from the beginning to the end. A Grand Love Story is a mesmeric daydream of an album, delving into trance-like psychedelic baselines and airy melodies that are always unique, never predictable. Listening to Portishead is like drinking a cup of good coﬀee. It is dark and bittersweet, and the flavour lingers on your tongue long after you have tasted it. Beth Gibbons’ vocals are haunting and sit in perfect balance with the instrumentation and electro elements. Despite the scratching techno elements, Portishead achieve a sense of harmony and sophistication that is smooth to the taste and draws you in in a manner that is at once complex and seemingly eﬀortless. Each of the tracks is a perfect complement to each other: this is an album that should be listened to in its entirety. Could it be called chill out? Perhaps not: there is a dark mystique that permeates their songs, in a way that is not typical of the genre. But it is a coolly thrilling approach to easy- listening that makes for an intriguing listen. Dummy is a haunting album, and a fascinating contribution to electronic music that will remain relevant for many decades to come."

4,the living stone,arts-entertainment," In 2018, I created the artwork The Heart of Stone. My idea rekindles a stone that percept as an inanimate object which solid, cold, hard, and heavy. How did I rekindle the stone? I rekindled it in perception. The stone contained air and it could swell and subside repeatedly by referring to the working system of the heart organ. The creation of installation art applied the idea of living and rekindling something. This idea was influenced by the theory of quantum. Since the time of the Paleolithic, human has given a sign of their presence and their group. The giving of the sign may be meant as a way of the previous human for the culture space, myths, macro-cosmos - micro-cosmos. This sign continues with the new meaning of being symbols; for instance, lingga - yoni, totem, monument, temple, Meru, Pagoda. They gave names with piles of stones high formed in monuments, carving stones in menhir shape which then continued to lingga - yoni. The developed signs have new meanings mystically and religiously. Becoming a spiritual center space. Which was originally a human as a pusering Jagad which then developed into space as a center of the universe. The spaces are made as places of worship. Informs of churches, temples, or mosques. Which originally started from stone as the main marker of pusering jagad. According to Rupert Sheldrake (2012) various views on the universe from the traditional Christian era to the materialism era. Before the 17th century, people believed that the universe was like an organism considering that nature was alive. In the 17th century, classical physics developed, revealing that the universe was like a set of a huge machines. From 1780 to 1830 in the Romantic movement, people viewed nature as a living creature rather than a mechanical one. Friedrich von Schelling (1707), applied these ideas to science, and they debated through the material of rekindled. Organism or holistic philosophy treats the whole nature as an alive thing, in this case, it is the updated pra mechanical animism. Even atoms, molecules, and crystals are organisms. The philosophy of organism showed that wherever we see nature on whatever level or scale, we will find wholeness which consists of intact parts themselves on a lower level. From the conclusion of the world views on the universe above, there are two kinds of views, namely the universe as a living organism and the universe which works like a machine. The conclusion may be applied as the basic assumption in my artwork. The living stone is how an artwork could disturb the audience's perception. The dead physical stone would be rekindled. How is the way?. I want the stone could move. The movements could be various, it could be shifted, rolling, or it may move only on its surface. With the change in the concept of rekindling inanimate objects, and the base of quantum theory. The theory triggers the idea to rekindle inanimate objects in the artwork change. Quantum theory claimed that every material consists of small parts which are not inanimate objects, but something that always moving alive. Viewed in a macro way, our surrounding nature may look passive, static, or dead. However, when it is analyzed in detail to the smallest parts, the objects which once looked passive, static, and dead will look different, and open to be interpreted and used as anything (Dwi Marianto, 2011,p. 90). How is the technic of rekindling the inanimate object?. The easiest thing is by moving only its surface, as the surface of the stomach or breast skin of a human when he is breathing, pulsated. By moving the part of the stone, it looks as if it is pulsated, then the audience's perception is as if the stone is alive. It is one of the techniques to make the audience's perception disturbed. From the idea of the living stone, I would like to apply it to my installation artwork by exploring the room architecturally with the reference to the subject above and how is the technique to present the subject matter. 2.1.	Quantum Theory A long time ago, people claimed everything was made of the atom, but today the statement is not fully true. However, many things are not made of atoms. For instance, electric currents, magnetic fields, and the gravitational field of the earth. Protons, neutrons, and electrons are not made of atoms. Atom is made of them. The universe is made of quanta. Quantum is often described as the science of mysterial and energy on the smallest level. Most of the physic quantum is carried out in molecular, atomic, and subatomic, the definition based on these sizes was extremely simplified because quantum is not always small; quanta usually could be as big as the earth. Two or more quanta could be considered as a single quantum, whose parts are fused and influence each other, even when they stay in a different galaxy 2.2.	The Peak Shift Principle In the practice of creating, artworks can be carried out in various ways. The purpose is to open new interpretations to several phenomena. For the subject matter and to develop artistic and technical practice tools, I used the method of approach to the subject matter, using the method of warming from Ramachandran, The Peak Shift Principle. Fine art often uses the words of feeling in the process of creation. The feeling is a sensation or the essence of something. In Britannica Encyclopedia, feelings can only be suggested to be experienced deeply, but cannot be expressed (Marianto,2011, p.149). For Ramachandran, to make the feeling be expressed strongly to be able to arouse the audience's aesthetic feeling is by making it to be extreme or exaggerating the feeling by caricaturing. It can activate the neutral mechanism of the brain. The previously weak feeling becomes huge appear its presence. There are two studies in the process of my creation. The first is about stones. Unconsciously the subject matter was triggered by the theory of Quantum. From the studies on the material and technique, there is one point related studied. It was using a device related to technology. so that the stone was viewed alive with the pulsated surface, which needed a mechanical device. While creating the critical impression, especially for the lighting. It needed a technology device. The process of creating the artwork is indirectly related to technology; thus, I collaborated with the person who knows about it, and how was the technique of presenting an artwork. The process I experienced, opened a new phenomenon in creating artworks. That is the relationship between art and other fields. I needed a together execution, with a collaboration."

6,Òran na h-Eala (2022),arts-entertainment," The camera is to cinema what the brush is to the canvas. It is from the lens that the story is written, the narrative pulse is dictated by the shots, the sequences, and the way they end up fitting into the final montage. All the elements of cinematographic language must be perfectly aligned so that the director's voice can reach the audience. In Òran na h-Eala (2022), director Steve Exeter takes advantage of every tool that cinema provides to conceive a film that is both a tribute to the seventh art and a way to re-imagine a classic. This thirteen-minute short film contains the essence of the original work that inspired it. From the opening titles and until the curtain falls in front of our eyes, surrendering to the visual force of the staging. As in the work of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, The Red Shoes (1948), the use of color plays a vital role to the point of becoming a character. The obsession and passion of the central figure is expressed with a varied color palette that changes between warm and cool tones depending on the mood. Moira Shearer (Shannon Davidson) puts her heart and soul into dance, ballet is the meaning of her life. As she rehearses tirelessly, filmmakers Michael Powell (Alastair Thomson Mills) and Emeric Pressburger (Alec Westwood) pressure her to star in their next film. Moira just wants to be a dancer and feels that movies will be a distraction. It is at this point where the script, written by the director himself, begins to delve into Shearer's psyche. Òran na h-Eala feeds on every heartbeat of its main actor, the structure of the story rests all its weight on the character of Moira, making her the main pivot to give mobility to the narrative. Shannon Davidson delivers a forceful and powerful performance. Body language makes us connect with the character and their emotions. When those close-ups embrace her face we can see her fears, frustrations and anxieties, her gaze conveys to us what words do not say. Davidson is clearly in total control of her histrionic registers, allowing her character to move freely and organically. Many filmmakers have been nurtured by the Powell and Pressburger classics, some turning to references to find creative solutions to staging dilemmas and others revering the film that has stood the test of time and including it in the list of their favorites. From the choreography of Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain (1952), through Jake LaMotta dancing in the ring of Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull (1980) and even Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan (2010), there are countless films that have gone to drink from that fountain. In the case of Exeter, it is more than evident that the matter is personal and in this, his second short film, he goes all out to honor this pillar of cinema. Òran na h-Eala is the perfect companion to The Red Shoes, addressing with creative freedom and biographical pretence a chapter in the life of Moira Shearer. It is not that this short film is a strict biopic, but moreover the fiction is drawn with a chronicled nuance that shines a light on the story behind one of the key moments in the history of cinema. The director shows maturity and determination in the staging, the details of each frame are perfectly balanced. Thomas Dobbie's cinematography is one of the high points of this short film, his camera always finds the perfect angle to get the most out of each shot. In the first part, he bombards us with exquisite close-ups and when the film reaches its climax, the lens drags us to the depths of Moira's soul with movements that change between the subtle and the abrupt with absolute precision. Garry Maddison's editing and colorization work plays a fundamental role in making sense of those images captured by Dobbie's lens. The other piece that completes the audio-visual universe of Òran na h-Eala is the original music by Mike Lukey and Arkadi Troitsky. Lukey provides the ""Song of the Swan"" performed exquisitely by Shannon Davidson and plays a fundamental role in giving insight to the central character. While Troitsky puts his signature on the composition for the ballet sequence that drags us to the dreamlike part of the film when Moira's character reaches her catharsis. Òran na h-Eala is a dazzling work that combines the elements of cinematographic language very well and that delivers the best in its staging and technical handling."
7,Poker Hands Explained,arts-entertainment," Despite the belief that poker has long fallen out of style, it recently made a comeback and is again fashionable. Of course, the global pandemic had a lot to do with this occurrence, as US casinos shutting down in 2020 increased New Jersey’s online poker revenues by over 100% in specific months of that year, compared to 2019 figures. That is a trend that also was present in other US states, which continued throughout 2021 and got replicated at land-based establishments in 2021. Moreover, the WSOP has also been making some massive moves lately. They hired actor Laurence Fishburne to star in a new series of advertisements for their brand and employed fellow silver screen star Vince Vaughn to act as the MC of the 53rd WSOP tournament in Las Vegas’ Bally casino. Thus, this is a perfect time for anyone not familiar with poker to start exploring this resurging pastime. And, it is an excellent opportunity for those that have neglected it to get back into card gambling action. Poker is a game of skill, where expertise can lead to a steady stream of wins, as evident by thousands of people profiting from playing online and the same batch of players continuously making their way onto WSOP main events each year. Naturally, the first thing needed to get started with this hobby/money-making opportunity is learning the ranking of poker hands. The quickest way to acquire this knowledge is to watch a winning poker hands video. It will help you better understand the best five-card combinations available. However, you can also read the guide outlining them below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9prlm8Nm_ss Poker Hand Order Simply put, poker hand rankings start from a simple high card and go up to a straight flush, the most challenging card combo to get. When the cards you get in your hand do not match any predefined combination and are all in different values and suits, the highest-ranking single card represents the highest card in your hand. That is the one you put up against what others hold at your table. A pair is when you have two cards of the same rank, and a two pair is when four out of your five cards form two couples. For instance, 4-4-3-3-A would be two pairs. These represent low-value hands and are nothing to get overly excited by when they land in front of you. Three-of-a-kind is a pretty self-explanatory hand. It is where the medium value combinations start. It beats all the previous ones listed, a pattern that we have been following, and will follow throughout this subheading as we rattle off the rest of the winning hands in poker. A straight flush is when you have five cards in a sequence, and a flush is when you hold five cards of the same suit. A full house is three-of-a-kind plus a pair, which is weaker than you just having four cards of the same rank (four-of-a-kind). A straight flush is a suited set in succession, and a royal one is an ace-high straight flush formed by a ten, jack, queen, king, and ace of the same suit. In most poker games, suits carry the same weight, meaning an ace-high flush of clubs has the same one as an ace-high flush of hearts. Yet, in some variations/games, usually, spade hands are the highest, and clubs the lowest. In cases of ties, a general rule of thumb is that the next highest card comes into play to determine the winning hand in poker. The best poker starting hand is always one containing two Aces. It boasts a potential winning percentage of 85% based on mathematical analysis. Poker Hand Odds Inspired by the percentage above, it is vital to note that statistics exist on the internet that will inform you of the probability of landing each hand detailed in this article. To discover how the winning percentages of hands in poker get formed, you first need to learn how to calculate - outs. These are unseen cards that, if drawn, will improve your poker hand. Understanding this concept, and the game, in general, has led math savvy individuals to calculate that the probability that you may get a royal flush in poker is 649.739 to one, or 0.000154%. That is pretty significant. The odds associated with a straight flush are sizably smaller at 72.192 to one, or 0.00139%. For four-of-a-kind, they are 4.164 to one (0.0240%) Things get more realistic for hands boasting a ranking of a full house (639 to 1) or lower. The probability of landing a pair is 1.37 to one, or 42.2569%, which means that this is the type of card combination you can expect to primarily get dealt when you play poker online or at land-based venues."
8,Four Of The Fabulous Folk Albums Released In Recent Years,arts-entertainment," Recent years have seen music spring to life in many areas that previously seemed dead. One genre that has seen a particular boom in the last couple of years is the folk scene. With the rise in outdoor living, wellness trends, and going back to basics, many people are beginning to rediscover the simple life. For many, this also includes going back to their musical roots. Folk music is an inspirational way to tap into the voices of those who came before. There is something undeniably spiritual about singing the songs that generations of men and women have sung before you. Why not have a listen to our picks and see how they touch your soul? The Soundtrack: Aidan O’Rourke - Iorram (Boat Song) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrzOUGjeuSU&list=OLAK5uy_lQlbD2EfFKpjpXLuzQzmPvIBsa7SYUSy8 Any good soundtrack should be well put-together enough to listen to on its own. And Aidan O'Rourke certainly achieves this with Iorram. The music, with its haunting Irish folk melodies, is playfully updated with elements of jazz accompaniment, as light touches of saxophone add a gentle lift to the mournful sound of the fiddle. An ode to the generations of Irish fishermen who have been working the coast for centuries, the lyrics are in traditional Gaelic, the throaty voices of the folk singers bringing a suggestion of the harshness of life on the waves. The music is dizzying, hypnotic, and spiritual, in a grounded way. O'Rourke is a master of his craft, and although the folk singers' voices add depth and a human voice to the music, they are not required. The music touches the soul all on its own, echoes of a landscape ever-changing. The Guitarist: Yasmin Williams - Urban Driftwood https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCxGY6FM_DQ&list=OLAK5uy_kkomkkaWc8UrZUfzeLQoaNGDxuTKcMt-o Listening to Urban Driftwood, there is a lightness that is transcendental; the notes tumble like swallows on the wind, grounded by the earthy, rhythmic tones of the drums and the gently melodic song of the kalimba. Yasmin's music sounds like hope. There is a deeper yearning that breathes another story beneath the cheerful top notes, but it never loses its sense of life and beauty. Her music dances from spirited to wistful, and captures a freshness, a sense of youth through the changing ages - like leaves turning red on an autumn day. It's the kind of music that you want to listen to by the fire; it warms your soul. There are no lyrics to Williams’ songs and they don’t need them. Her guitar speaks for her more clearly than words ever could. There is a subtlety to the music that could not be easily captured in a song. Williams is a very promising guitarist and her second album is an enticing insight into her depths as a musician. We are excited to see what more will come from her. The Folk Rocker: Grace Cummings - Storm Queen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KT3iL5SMo4&list=OLAK5uy_mrWjfHwJxCrv0Up2hszP3k9r4TWh-mh7U The title of Grace Cummings’ second album is a simple yet intriguing hint as to the chaotic emotional whirlwind captured in each song. There is a rolling rhythm with the rise and fall of her voice, from the deep, soulful depths of the lowest tones, to the more fragile, brittle high notes - like the swell and ebb of a wave. Her voice is timeless; you could place her music in any given era. There are echoes of ancient Irish folk ballads roughly edged with the gravelly tones of modern rock. She perfectly bridges the gaps between time and space; sometimes bluesy and cool, with a smooth timbre - other times fierce, raspy and passionate. The backing track is used tastefully, and every note and addition is carefully chosen. Her style is minimalistic, and it compliments the richness of her voice perfectly. There are echoes of Bob Dylan in the twang of the acoustic guitar, but it still feels fresh today. Overall, if you’re looking for a rollercoaster ride of an album, which sweeps you up and away into its storytelling, Storm Queen is a beautiful, bluesy twist on the folk genre. The Duo: Watchhouse – Self-Titled https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X_AEuqWak4&list=PL0mSnUSmZIvubMw8xRBf-a64nKYUorlQN If you're looking for a chilled out, nostalgic ode to Americana, Watch House will warm your heart and fill you with memories of the Old West that you haven't lived. The casual, melodic strumming of the guitar is eﬀortless and perfectly in harmony with the roll of the lyrics. At points, a fiddle or melodica is used to lift the music, and it creates such a beautifully bittersweet eﬀect that it is impossible not to be compelled by the stories behind the lyrics. Watchhouse brings together the very best of the American ballad and reveals the raw heart at the centre. This album captures the essence of the West, and keeps it neatly between its covers."
