If you are in SEO or have tried to hire someone recently to do SEO for you, then you’ve probably heard about backlinks. Either you go out and claim backlinks on the behalf of your clients, or you have had someone try and tell you that backlinks are the important part of SEO. First, let’s be clear, the most important part of SEO is content and not backlinks. At its core, Google is trying to show the websites that have the best and most relevant content to a search query. If you do not have great content, you will not be able to rank. Okay, Content First Then Backlinks But What Backlinks? The type of backlinks you will want to get will depend on the type of business that you run. Local Business A dry cleaner, contractor, appliance repair, house cleaning, or any other local business. Getting backlinks for your business is easy, but not all backlinks are equal. The first thing you need to know is to focus on getting local backlinks. Blueprint Digital Marketing & SEO head office is located in Calgary, so we focus on finding other local backlinks for our business. Here are a few examples of directories local to us.

Design over white Ecommerce or National Businesses The good news is that if you run an eCommerce shop or a business that services an entire Province, State, or Country, finding directories will be easy for you. This is because almost every directory will provide a little bit of traffic and/or value to your website. The bad news is that your competition also has this advantage, so if you want to outrank your competition you will have to try extra hard to find good quality backlinks. Good Examples of Backlinks Yellow Pages Canada One Canadian Business Directory These are good directories, because either they have a recognizable brand or lots of organic traffic from having existed for a while. If you need to check and see how much traffic a directory has, the Hoth has a good and free website traffic checker. Free Vs Paid Backlinks This is hotly debated amongst SEO agencies, but from our experience, it is fine to pay for a business profile that provides a link to your website. What you don’t want to do is pay for a link exchange, private link network, or a website that exists only to provide backlinks. The key to good link building is that it should be natural, not automated, or giving signals to Google that you’ve found a way to get dozens or hundreds of backlinks in a matter of weeks or even a month. Like all things in life, if you consistently build backlinks to your website, you will get good results. Content Marketing This is another great way to get really good backlinks for your business website. By creating high-quality content and promoting it across the internet, other businesses and websites will want to link to you. Think of any website that has ever had a blog and needed to reference something for one of their posts, a good example is the Hoth website traffic checker linked above. The key to a good content marketing strategy is to provide content that is useful and written in an engaging manner, to achieve that you should hire a professional copywriter. In closing, the key to getting good backlinks for your business will depend on the type of business that you have. Always make sure the links you are getting come from quality websites and try to start as relevant as possible to your business and city or town. Once you have exhausted all of the good backlinks, you can then start working on finding more generalized or poor-quality backlinks."

4,The Role of Equity Research,business," Equity research is a powerful tool for investors. Investment firms employ analysts to perform in-depth research and analysis on companies, producing reports that explain current trends and projected performance. While smaller firms may only staff a couple of analysts to target specific industries, large firms can have thousands of analysts covering a wide range of companies and industries. These analysts are usually academics, former executives, or people with a long history in their industry. In the following sections, learn about the role equity research plays in guiding investment decisions. Helps Investors Make Informed Investments With so many businesses looking for investors and constantly changing market conditions, investors want to be careful about where they invest their money. Equity research provides investors with detailed information to help them make informed investments. Big investors don’t usually have time to dig deep into every single company they invest in–they rely on these reports to help inform their decisions, calculate risks, and hopefully get a good return on their investments. Offers Professional and Objective Analyses of Investment Potential Research reports generally disclose any connections with the company in question and the analyst preparing it, so investors will know how biased the report might be. Since analysts are experts in their field and have the time and resources to dive deep into these companies, investors can usually trust their analysis. Analysts compose these reports with current market conditions in mind, giving more optimistic projections to businesses operating in hot markets. Makes Recommendations on Whether to Buy, Sell or Hold Stock Equity research reports offer an overview of past and projected performance and make direct recommendations as to what to do with the company’s stock. If they’re projecting high growth, the analyst might recommend buying stock, whereas they might recommend selling if the industry is on a downward trend. Whether or not investors decide to follow these recommendations is up to them, and analysts can never guarantee their predictions, but they offer a great starting point. Helps Generate Business Valuation Another crucial role of equity research is providing business valuations. These valuations can be run on a couple of different models but usually either represent a company or asset’s inherent value or that value relative to another company or asset. These valuations are helpful for investors who need to know the worth of their investments and the businesses themselves."
5,Why Do Contractors Need Insurance Coverage?,business," As adolescents enter adulthood, they begin to realize the enormous need for insurance. Not only does insurance apply to your car, home, health, and overall life, but there are various legal requirements for insurance across different industries. General liability insurance is just as much a necessity for contractors as it is for any other individual, as it can help protect against lawsuits and other sensitive issues found in a contract. This type of insurance protects contractors from third-party claims of bodily injury or property damage that came as a result of conducting business. Given the physical nature of the job, general liability insurance is an essential aspect of running such a business. What Does General Liability Insurance Include? When picking a policy, it is recommended to read the fine print and choose the option that will best guard your company and employees against any potential damage. General liability insurance typically includes coverage for bodily injuries, which can range from minor to major. Let’s say a customer trips and breaks a toe at a job site. Without proper insurance, they could decide to sue you, making you solely responsible for their medical and rehabilitation costs. However, general liability insurance does not protect the company from claims made by their employees, which is why most experts recommend worker’s compensation insurance on top of this. Property damage is also another aspect of general liability insurance, which would protect your company from having to cover the cost of any damage done to possessions belonging to the customer. General liability insurance also contributes to personal and advertising injury, usually including slander and related issues. As an extra add-on to this insurance, your company can also include coverage for equipment damage, which would help cover replacement fees if your work-related equipment falls victim to any damages or thievery. This option is very appealing to various contractors who rely on their equipment to get the job done. If there were to be any damages incurred to their tools, they could be looking at a deep financial setback. A little lesser known in the contracting industry is data breach coverage. This add-on to general liability insurance can help cover costs associated with any detrimental results of a data breach. What Other Insurance Coverage Should Contractors Use? Although general liability insurance covers a broad range of possible issues, there are some other insurance coverage options that contractors should obtain. Worker’s compensation insurance, as mentioned earlier, is wise protection to have. However, contractors should also look into commercial property insurance, professional liability insurance, commercial auto insurance, builder’s risk insurance and product liability insurance. Although insurance costs can add up, it is wise for contractors to take advantage of these protective measures in order to avoid higher costs associated with being sued or paying out of pocket for damages or injuries. When weighing the risks of less insurance coverage, most contractors will agree that investing in insurance is a small price to pay for peace of mind."
