0,Disposing of Oil,social-issues," Did you know that each year, close to 500 million litres of lubricating oil is sold in Australia? Lubricating oil is the oil used in engines, and while some engines (such as two-stroke lawnmower engines) burn oil completely, others like machinery and motor vehicle engines produce large volumes of used oil that can be reclaimed and reused. At CopperRock Recycling centre, we accept this used oil for recycling for a small fee. Similarly, cooking oil needs to be disposed of correctly. Unfortunately, we cannot accept cooking oil for recycling at CopperRock. However, there are many local companies that can collect your cooking oil waste - such as Your Oil Man, and Cookers. If disposed of incorrectly, used oil has the potential to pollute land, water and infrastructure. It takes only one litre of oil to contaminate one million litres of water and a single automotive oil change produces 4 to 5 litres of used oil. There are at least 250 million litres of used oil generated in Australia every year. But it’s not just oil waste that’s a landfill hazard, it’s also the packaging that oil comes in - particularly lubricating oils due to residual oil contamination. Hence, why we cannot accept your empty oil container at Copper Rock. There are approximately 3,050 tonnes of contaminated small volume motor vehicle oil containers sent to landfill each year. Though this number is actually thought to be higher than that when you take into account the full range of petroleum-based oil lubricants available. To tackle this issue, the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO), under the Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands Plastics Pact (ANZPAC), has received funding to develop a national product stewardship scheme for the recovery and reprocessing of used oil containers.  APCO has completed stage one of the project which includes understanding the current landscape for oil containers and developing preliminary scheme design options. They’re working to have the scheme design finalised and an implementation plan by March 2023. The high-level scope of the project includes investigation of: • The collection and recycling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) motor oil containers sold in Australia up to 20 litres in capacity. • Labelling and public education. • The potential for packaging re-use models. • End-markets and use of recycled content. Once the project is implemented a whole supply chain approach will be adopted to ensure industry engagement in the design of an efficient and effective scheme which aims to: • Increase the recovery of oil containers up to 20 litres. • Reduce the impact of oil bottles on the environment and human health. • Investigate innovative advanced recycling technology and alternative reuse models for oil bottles. • Establish recovery targets in line with the ANZPAC Plastics Pact.

1,Assessing Socioeconomic Disadvantage in College Admissions,social-issues," Intelligent recently reported that 34 percent of whites who applied to college falsified their applications by wrongly claiming that they were racial minorities. According to the research, white males lied 48 percent of the time. White females only lied 16 percent of the time.[1] In a follow-up tweet, Professor Ibram X. Kendi asserted that the research proved that white students maintained their privilege by gaming the admissions process. Critics retorted that the research undermines the belief that white privilege is laced into every aspect of shared existence. If white privilege is pervasive, why do applicants to elite schools gain a benefit when they pretend to be colored?[2] According to discovery in recent discrimination lawsuits at Ivy League schools, when admission officials must pick between two applicants with similar applications, the minority (excluding Asians) will be selected. Because of this, identifying as a minority when applying to Ivy League universities improves an applicant’s chances for acceptance.[3] For these reasons, white applicants gain an advantage when applying if they identify as a racial minority. School officials defend racially biased admissions policies (affirmative action) on four grounds. First, minorities are disadvantaged. Second, the composition of the student body should mirror the demographic make-up of the country. Third, grades, test scores, internships, special abilities, notable achievements, awards, references, and the quality of the application must be supplemented by the “whole person” test. The whole person criterion allows admission officials to select students who are less meritorious because they possess intangible qualities that the university values. Fourth, racial diversity improves the academic learning environment. The above points can be nuanced and debated. For example, how does one objectively measure the racial disadvantage of a college applicant? Why does racial diversity improve the overall learning environment? More importantly, should universities that receive federal money be exempted from civil rights law that forbids discrimination based on race, color, or national origin? Case law allows a little wiggle room when universities are attempting to balance the racial composition of their schools. However, when applying admission policies that consider race, schools cannot use quotas. Instead, they strive for percentile representations. For instance, at Harvard, 28 percent of the student body comes from Black, Latino, and other non-Asian minority categories. Around 42 percent are white Americans.[4] A consortium of Asian Students has claimed that Harvard’s admissions policies discriminate against them. In 2022, the Supreme Court will consider their lawsuit. In the meantime, the president of Harvard reiterated why its admissions policy is necessary. ""Considering race as one factor among many in admissions decisions produces a more diverse student body which strengthens the learning environment for all."" Students for Fair Admissions countered by saying, ""In a multi-racial, multi-ethnic nation like ours, the college admissions bar cannot be raised for some races and ethnic groups but lowered for others. Our nation cannot remedy past discrimination and racial preferences with new discrimination and different racial preferences""[5] In the current debate, no one is saying that universities cannot consider student disadvantage or seek for a diverse student body. Rather, a prima fascia reading of the law says that schools cannot consider race when accepting new students. The use of race is problematic for another reason. Even though the Ivy schools argue that their admission policies balance the racial composition of the student body, universities select between individuals for whom race is only a part of their social identity. It should be noted that races do not apply to school. Individuals do. As such, the rightness of the admission policy should be determined on a case-by-case basis. For example, when two equally qualified applicants are being considered, it’s possible that the rejected white student attended subpar public schools in a desperately impoverished community and the accepted minority student came from a rich family and attended a prestigious college prep school. In this example, the race-based policy favored the one with the greater socioeconomic advantage. In light of the above scenario, assumptions about Caucasians need to be reevaluated. In fact, there are many white populations in America. Since some are economically privileged and others are not, Ivy League schools should distinguish between the various white groupings. It’s helpful to remember that white includes orphans, Gypsies, the rural poor, day laborers, children from single-parent homes, and a vast assortment of people from grossly dysfunctional homes. Case in point, even though the entire region of Appalachia is economically depressed, has low rates of achievement, and suffers from chronic unemployment, elite schools do not create admission policies to balance that population. [6] If they did, one in twelve students would come from Appalachia? Instead, a white applicant from Appalachia falls into a uber competitive category. This is the point; some white people don’t enjoy privilege, and some minorities don’t suffer from socioeconomic disadvantage. A person is more than her race. As such, the university application process should measure tangible indicators of disadvantage. Pointedly, why should an Ivy League school use race as the main criterion by which it measures disadvantage and social diversity since it is not a socioeconomic term? Furthermore, from a legal perspective, race is a blurry concept that is hard to define and nearly impossible to operationalize. The conclusions of the Intelligent research article missed four additional points. One, since race is a social construct, the federal government allows Americans to self-identify as they please on official documents. As such, one does not have to lie or take a DNA test to identify with a social category of her choice when applying to a school. In fact, America does not have a test to determine race. This highlights the problematic nature of Kendi's ""gaming the system"" tweet. What percentage of African DNA must an American have to qualify as an African American? Can a white-appearing person who comes from mixed parentage call herself Black? After how many generations of assimilation into the American melting pot does a Latino person cease to qualify as Latino? Second, race favoring admissions policies have greatly demoralized meritorious high school students and disincentivized academic achievement. Exceptional students who graduate from elite universities create new technologies, solve complex problems, and cure vexing diseases. Their success is America’s success! America’s collective progress depends on the cultivation of its most gifted students. For the sake of the world, meritorious achievement should drive admission policies in Ivy League schools. Third, reports show that growing percentages of young whites are internalizing rhetoric that identifies white as an oppressor term. This is causing social anxiety.[7] Desperately, some whites want to escape from the stigma of that term. Many do this by imagining that they are a racial minority. Others do this by claiming to be a sexual minority. For example, Newsweek reported that 40 percent of Gen-Zs identify as LGBTQ.[8] Society should tell these guilt-ridden students that white is not bad. They can monitor privilege and practice cultural humility without feeling guilt or shame about their skin color, heritage, or life opportunities. How one acknowledges inequality and strives for justice is more important than one’s social location. Fourth, objective ways to measure socioeconomic disadvantage have been developed. A report by de Castro, Gee, and Takeuchi shows that socioeconomic measurements vary by ethnicity and location. For example, all Asian Americans are not rich and a person living in Los Angeles needs more income than a person in rural Ohio.[9] Professor John Jerrim’s nine-part process to measure disadvantage among those applying to college should be considered because it compensates for localized deviation and does not appeal to race.[10] In his approach, qualification for free lunches and area-level markers are the best indicators of disadvantage. Mental and physical disabilities should also be considered. In short, racism is a legacy problem that vexes America. It is a social fact that can be measured. Moreover, it is a daily reality for many people. Often it is associated with disadvantage. This problem must not be minimized or ignored. Yet, by itself, race does not equate to disadvantage. Furthermore, how America talks about social inequality is as important as how it seeks to eliminate it. For these reasons, Ivy League schools should create and employ racially neutral admission standards that objectively measure disadvantage. Furthermore, the schools should prioritize achievement.

2,The Three Managerial Types that Will Make You Want to Walk Out the Door—and What to Do About It,social-issues," We’ve all had a manager who made us feel like we wanted to walk out the door. For example: your manager assigned you a project that—if she would have taken one sip from the cup of reality—there would have been no way you could have completed the project by the deadline. Or: your manager talked about improving company culture all the time, but yet clearly demonstrated that he didn’t have the slightest clue how to do that himself. If this rings true for you, then this is your read today! Over my career, I have had some horrible managers. Now that I know what I know, I realize that those bad managers just simply did not have the tools they needed to be effective. As I write this, I can hear my mother say, “Bless their little hearts.”  But I would venture to say—because you are still reading—you have had some similar experiences. Either that, or your refresh button is not working properly. In any case, I’d like to share what I’ve learned. Simply put, the workforce today is full of occupiers. What is an occupier? Occupiers are people who exist in a certain position, but they don't know--or have true purpose in--why they are there. They are really just sitting ducks. And what happens when you don't feel like you have a strong purpose? You simply assign yourself one. And that purpose can look a lot more like an agenda. The interesting thing about assigning yourself an agenda is that we generally assign ourselves something that we can easily meet—or control—because a challenge would put us to a real test. And that can be scary. Just ask the person who sets a New Year's resolution to not eat sweets and then purchases Oreos on January 2nd, as a symbol of never going back to chocolate. Somehow, this person devours a whole row of Oreos while binge watching episodes of Little House on the Prairie. Darn you, Mrs. Olsen! Laura did not steal candy from your store! I’m writing from personal experience here. But I digress. Here’s another example. What about the person who purchases a gym membership, and then, while watching TV (instead of working out), gets angry at the gym membership commercials, as if they are passive aggressive subliminal messages directed towards him, because he hasn’t set foot in the gym all month? Ouch. That’s me again. But the point is: many people don't see their personal challenges all the way through. And becoming a good manager means that you’ll see the process of development to the very end. Bad managers often seek to control what is on the surface, which manifests as nit picking and micromanaging of minuscule tasks. These bad managers most often fall into three categories: Clock Watchers, Error Finders, and “I already showed you how to do that one time-ers.” Let’s start with the Clock Watchers. Clock Watchers manage what they think is easiest to control. They focus on when you get to work, how long you stay on break, and when you leave. Of course time management is important, but if this is the only focus of employee performance—with no emphasis on productivity—there is a problem. When it comes to supervision objectives, Clock Watchers don’t seem to have a good depth of understanding about employee productivity. Clock Watchers focus on time because it is easy—and yes, it is evaluative—but it ignores product creation, which is central to the purpose of the organization. Clock watching as a management style disrupts employees’ ability to participate in a creative process that would produce the overall organizational output objectives. The question that should be asked of Clock Watchers is: Do you have the capacity to manage the production that is happening each work day, as well as the employees’ life cycle? Next, there are the Error Finders. These managers are quite interesting, because what Error Finders see in their employees is themselves. The employee is a mirror to the Error Finder. The only way Error Finders would ever feel managerial worth is to find flaws in every little detail, in order to build their own importance to a point of relevance—almost like a medicine—to make them feel better. Generally, you see this play out in Error Finders bringing unnecessary or displaced critique when not warranted. For example, an Error Finder will call attention to things such as an “an” in a DRAFT document in front of a vowel, instead of an “a.” Clearly, they have completely overlooked the content to see the flaw, and their critique is a feeble attempt to express power. In this situation, I can hear my mother say, “Child, please.” Another Error Finder example would go like this: Perhaps you stumbled over a word in a presentation, and all your manager could focus on was that one stumble--even though the rest of your content was delivered very well. A classic hallmark of the Error Finder comes forth at staff meetings, when other people have signed on to the agenda to discuss important points. Throughout the meeting, the Error Finder will dominate—and end up being the only one talking. These managers want to be in control of errors, so they can put the superhero cape on and fly to rescue, as if they are not responsible for the whole operation. If it is not clear at this point, Error Finders have some serious problems. And in my opinion, out of the three, this managerial type can give a devastating blow to an organization’s turnover metric. Even worse, employees working under the Error Finder suffer some real post-traumatic effects. Finally, we get to the “I already showed you how to do that one time-ers.” These managers lack patience and empathy with training information. In their minds, having to repeat processes indicates a lack of intelligence, and they use subtle fear and intimidation tactics to deter additional inquires. Thus, that is the reason they want to bully you by saying, “I showed you how to do that already.” These managers are known to say, “I learned it on my own, and nobody really showed me how to do it.” So they think you should magically know what to do. It’s basically the “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” mentality—but on steroids. These managers are culture killers. The reason they are so negative and safeguarded with the information they give is that they don't understand the process—or how to execute it—themselves. The sad part is that they would show you how to do it, gladly, if they knew how to do it! Instead, they rely on the protection of their title as “manager” to keep them safe. As Bruce Coville wrote, “Withholding information is the essence of tyranny. Control of the flow of information is the tool of dictatorships.” So that wrath—or that urge to walk out the door—that you are feeling is actually your incapable manager’s own inability to demonstrate competency in the area he is training you in. Most people—and good managers, especially—understand that there are multiple learning styles, and that someone might not comprehend all information by being shown something once. However, when the person training you has minimum depth herself, you can almost guarantee that what she has to give you will be what she can control. More often than not, what she can control is her attitude. So attitude is what she gives you. All three poor management scenarios above have one thing in common: a lack of capacity. Webster’s Dictionary defines capacity as the “ability to contain or deal with something; mental or physical power.” And it takes capacity to lead. A leader who has demonstrated capacity understands that it is important to properly train, evaluate, and monitor information for productivity. If there are employee deficiencies, a manager with capacity will monitor said deficiencies and develop a growth plan for the employee, to foster professional development. Remember, the bottom line in the workplace is respect—employees for managers and managers for employees. When people don’t feel respected in the workplace, especially by their managers, low productivity will inevitably follow. Managers who aren’t leading with their employees’ creativity, individual learning style, and sense of personal agency in mind are doomed to create a toxic work environment in which employees cannot thrive. And employees who do not feel respected should probably reconsider whether that job is the right place for them. Whether you do decide to stay or leave, hopefully you can find the courage to talk to someone in upper management about your difficulties. Many times, the managers described above have polished their facades so well that upper management is unaware of their deficiencies. Take a moment ask for help, know your chain of command, and understand how to use it. Even if it is your first day."
3,Win the War in Ukraine Using Hybrid All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs),social-issues," The Problem Initially, Russia thought they could invade Ukraine with superior manpower and equipment and take control of the country in a few days.  Instead, they encountered a trained Ukrainian army equipped with advanced weapons such as Stinger missiles to defend their airspace and Javelin missiles to defend their ground.  Furthermore, the Ukrainian people exhibited a strong will to fight.  As a result, Russia’s initial thrust was impeded, and they suffered heavy casualties. Due to these high initial casualties, Russia quickly changed its strategy to the one used for thousands of years: surround a city, bombard it, and prevent critical food, water, energy, and rearmament supplies from entering.  That is what Russia is doing today.  They bomb and shell a Ukrainian city from afar with airstrikes and ground artillery.  They stop critical supplies from reaching a besieged Ukrainian city.  Once a city surrenders, Russian military forces move to the next city and repeat the process.  Russia plans to have fewer casualties and effectively utilize its superior troop and equipment strengths with this strategy. Given Putin’s mindset to win at all costs, Russia’s new strategy of surrounding cities, cutting supplies, and bombing and shelling cities into submission will probably and eventually lead to Russia’s occupation of Ukraine.  Due to the fierce resistance by the Ukrainians to the Russian invasion, the cities are expected to be severely damaged, and considerable civilian and military casualties are expected as well. Even though Russia may shortly occupy Ukraine, many people believe that Putin will eventually lose the war due to a long-term insurgency by the Ukrainians and stiff sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its European allies.  Unfortunately, the reinstatement of Ukraine as an independent state may take years to happen under this scenario. This forecast outcome is expected to come at a high cost to Ukraine, with bombed-out cities and significant civilian and military casualties.  However, it does not have to be this way. A New Strategy to Fight the Russians Ukraine needs to go on the offensive to break Russia’s stranglehold on its encircled cities.  The following is a suggested strategy for the defense of Ukraine. The U.S. and its European allies would supply the Ukrainians with All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs), initially gas-powered ATVs but with hybrid gas/electric ATVs, as soon as possible.  The hybrid ATVs would have the advantage of being quiet in electric mode for sneak attacks.  The hybrid ATVs would also emit no heat to reduce potential Russian heat-seeking missile attacks.  Furthermore, they could be charged with solar panels when gasoline is in short supply or when hiding in the country.  In addition, some ATVs would have racks installed for holding either Stinger, Javelin, or Guided missiles. In addition, the U.S. and its European allies would supply the Ukrainians with the Stinger, Javelin, and Guided missiles to load onto their ATVs, night vision goggles, AK-47 assault rifles with plenty of ammunition, GPS locators, and Starlink for communication as well as solar panels for remote charging of the hybrid ATVs and Starlinks. Surveillance drones could also be supplied to locate Russian forces for a future attack.  In this way, the Ukrainians would be prepared to take the offensive with their fully equipped ATVs. Some of the Ukrainian forces would leave the cities and hide in the country in small patrols, numbering about five per patrol.  An ATV in each patrol would carry either a Javelin, Stinger, or Guided missile launcher as well as their respective missiles.  Another ATV would have Starlink and GPS guidance systems.  The remaining three ATVs would be riding shotgun with AK-47 assault rifles. Consider the following example of an operation targeting a Russian artillery installation.  First, U.S. satellites would pinpoint Russian artillery exact GPS coordinate locations.  Next, a Ukrainian patrol would be given the GPS coordinates over their Starlink communication devices.  Alternatively, the Russian target could be found by using the patrol's surveillance drone.  Then using the patrol’s GPS locator or knowing its location from drone operations, the patrol would sneak up within a mile of the Russian artillery position.  Finally, when the artillery is firing and producing heat, the patrol would take it out with a heat-seeking Javelin missile.  The patrol would then quickly sneak away and hide.  With night vision goggles, this operation could be done day or night.  The rest of the patrol could defend with their AK-47 assault rifles in the case of a possible Russian small arms fire. The same tactic discussed above could be employed for Russian tanks and vehicles moving troops and supplies when a heat signature is available for Javelin missile guidance.  For troop encampments with no heat for missile guidance, guided ground-to-ground missiles using U.S. satellite-provided GPS coordinates could be used to sneak up, fire, and sneak away, day or night.  Whenever Russian aircraft are in the area, Stinger missiles could be fired to bring them down. In addition, ATVs could be used with trailers to supply hidden ATV patrols in the country with new missiles, fuel, food, and water. Separate Javelin, Stinger, and Guided missile patrols could be employed in the proximate area to each other.  Together they would form an ATV battalion, quick to move from hiding to attack and back into hiding.  They would never take a Russian force head-on; they would only make fast, devasting hit-and-run attacks. Suppose the Russians have not surrounded a Ukrainian city.  The city’s military could be supplied directly by the U.S. and NATO with ATVs, Javelin, Stinger, Guided missiles, night goggles, GPS locators, AK-47s, drones, solar panels, and Starlinks.  On the other hand, if a city has already been surrounded, the Ukrainian military fully equipped ATV battalions from a non-surrounded city could open a supply channel to the besieged city to provide critical supplies. By taking the offensive, Ukraine's cities could be spared from being destroyed and a vast number of military and civilian lives saved.  The winning strategy is to create a hard-hitting, fast-moving, hidden mobile military force using hit-and-run tactics with equipped ATVs with excellent communication and lethal firepower.  This new strategy could win the war for Ukraine in short order if employed quickly and in large numbers. The author wishes for this information to get into the hands of the U.S. government or military officials who can take immediate action.  If the reader knows someone who can help, pass this post.  If not, post it to people you know.  Maybe some of them may know someone who can help.  Time is of the essence; Ukrainian lives depend on it."
4,"To: The Brookings Institute, Subject: Eliminating Poverty, Racism, & War",social-issues," CC: Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, Economic Policy Institute, American Enterprise Institute, Aspen Institute, Center for American Progress, RAND Corporation, as well as any and all other DC based Economic Think Tanks who are interested in this subject Dear Brookings Institute, I’m a Board Member of an Arlington, VA based not for profit group called the Center for Economic and Social Justice (WWW.CESJ.ORG). The main purpose of CESJ is to advocate on behalf of an ownership based, free market orientation to the economy known either as the Economic Democracy Act (EDA) or Universal Basic Ownership (UBO). The members of our group contend that the USA could solve a myriad of problems, starting with poverty and structural racism, by making every American (regardless of age, gender, race, religion, or political persuasion) an owner of wealth producing capital assets. Furthermore, we contend that these goals could be achieved without creating a dime of governmental or consumer debt. Implementing the EDA strategy would actually allow us to start paying down our exponentially growing (now over $30 trillion-dollar) national debt. The Conventional Scenario… More specifically, the Federal Reserve makes an annual assessment of how much money will be required to fund the following year’s economic growth. For example, in 2018 they estimated that our economic growth would require approximately $4 trillion dollars-worth of funding in 2019. So, where does all that money come from? Conventionally it comes from the wealthy class – those who can afford to buy the stocks, bonds, and technologies that represent this annual growth. 2019 was no exception. Most of that projected growth was funded (purchased, owned, and controlled) by fewer than 10% of Americans. Thus wealth/ power became increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few (10%) at the expense of the many (90%). Now Let’s Reshuffle the Cards With those thoughts in mind, let’s look at this scenario through a different lens. If you divide $4 trillion dollars by 330 million (people in the US), you’ll find that about $12,000 per individual was going to be required to fund America’s economic growth of 2019. Now what if the Federal Reserve (as authorized by the Federal Reserve Act, section 13, paragraph 2), through local banks, had made an ANNUAL $10,000 (round numbers are easier to work with) line of credit at 0% interest, accessible to every citizen, regardless of age, gender, race, or political persuasion? Furthermore, what if these lines of credit COULD ONLY BE USED to buy stocks in qualified business ventures (meaning the odds of these investments paying off the annual loans with pre-tax dividends – FUTURE EARNINGS not past savings - in 3 to 7 years are excellent)? And what if, as these annual, self-liquidating loans continue to PAY THEMSELVES OFF, the dividends continue to flow and they become investment income for their new capital owners? Instantly Collateralized As you can see, all these transactions would be collateralized the moment a purchase was made. They’d also be 100% capital credit insured. In other words, nobody – not the government or the individual investor is on the hook - even if a supposedly sound investment failed to live up to expectations. A proverbial win/win for everyone concerned. And since in this strategy production always precedes consumption, inflation is systematically abolished. The Democratizing Potential… The democratizing potential inherent in making every American citizen an owner of wealth producing capital assets is what allows CESJ members to contend that we can eliminate the economic roots of poverty, structural racism, and war without creating any debt, while simultaneously paying down the national debt in the process. That said, if you see flaws in our logic, we’d appreciate you pointing them out so we can make the appropriate adjustments. On the other hand, if you see no flaws, we like to suggest a meeting in order to explore how to best go about implementing the EDA/UBO strategy ASAP! Respectfully, Rick Osbourne Board Member Center for Social and Economic Justice (CESJ.ORG) 630-857-3502 Osbourne.rick@gmail.com"
5,Do the Government’s climate objectives really matter? Yes! But not to them.,social-issues," Do the Government’s climate objectives really matter? Yes! But not to them. Before I start this article I would like to foreshadow for you its following contents much like Shakespeare at the beginning of Romeo and Juliet. Although I don't foreshadow two star crossed lovers taking their lives, I do say the Government's distant relationship with the climate emergency could spell an unfortunate Romeo and Juliet type ending. Trees. Those things we walk past every now and again. Quite pleasant I hope you agree. There is not much debate as to whether they are good for the environment either. Don't just take my word for it. The woodland trust called trees ``Our biggest weapon in the fight against climate change”. They would say that but relevant nonetheless. In fact a flight from London to Paris would require 0.4 of a tree to offset the carbon emissions released by the plane according to the best known C02 emissions calculator. In addition 400+ tonnes carbon per hectare, is how much a young wood with mixed native species can lock up in trees, roots and soil. Effective If you ask me. So what is the Government doing about this? Well last year the Government planted 4.2million trees, something Boris Johnson if asked about would call a fantastic achievement. However, as ambitious and great as this sounds, the Government’s target is to plant 30 million trees every year ( 4.2 million is less than 14% of their target). However we really shouldn't be surprised. Especially with the Conservatives track record. In their 2019 manifesto they outlined their ambitions which included insulating all homes to level C by 2030. To do this the government will have to insulate One million homes a year however only 110,000 homes had been insulated last year. Hence sparking the ‘Insulate Britain’ protests. Not only would Insulating One million homes a year help in our fight against climate change, It would also have helped people pay their bills due to the insulation reducing the cost of bills. Don't just take my word for it, listen to Chris Stark, head of the UK's Climate Change Committee telling the BBC that he rates government policy on insulation as ""very poor"". Having said all this I am not blind to the fact that the world has faced a global pandemic. I appreciate many things have been put on hold. Nevertheless climate change unfortunately won't stop for us, and the lack of action whether the government has ignored their climate change goals or prioritised their mess of a pandemic response may and probably will contribute to the staying below 1.5 degrees as a distant memory, a thing of the past, a missed opportunity. Are we entirely surprised though at the lack of urgency? It is Boris leading the Conservatives after all. Why shouldn't this surprise us? Although I believe strongly that a person can change, I believe the individual has to prove it by showing how they have changed. I say this because in 2013 writing for the Telegraph the PM said “As a species, we human beings have become so blind with conceit and self-love that we genuinely believe that the fate of the planet is in our hands — when the reality is that everything, or almost everything, depends on the behaviour and caprice of the gigantic thermonuclear fireball around which we revolve.” On top of this Boris Johnson found himself agreeing with conspiracy theorist Piers Corbyn, brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. In 2013 Johnson said in his Telegraph column “Don't write him off”. Yes I know what you're thinking, Boris Johnson our Prime Minister told us not to write off a man who not only believes climate change is a hoax and that vaccines are harmful but also a man who wrote one of the worst songs of our generation comparing wearing a mask to keeping a fart in your trousers. I could riddle this article with multiple Boris Johnson quotes on climate change but I won't bore you. What I can tell you whilst planning for this article is that I could see a lot of the word “but” when he talked about climate change. The now PM would talk about the threat of climate change then constantly downplay the severity of climate change by saying the dreaded word “but”. It's like when your parents would tell you to apologise and you do, before saying “but” and going on to proclaim your innocence. As you can probably guess, my use of the word “but” delegitimised my apology and got me in trouble with my parents. Although the PM isn't apologising it still doesn't fill me with confidence that his self proclaiming of being a strong believer in climate change is true. To reiterate I do believe people can change but Boris Johnson hasn't and I fear he will not. His history of misinformation, his history of caring about no one but himself, his party's lack of ambition will lead to a Romeo and Juliet type ending for our livelihoods and the generations to come."
6,Freedom and The Economic Democracy Act,social-issues," George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, and Donald J. Trump (among others, i.e. the 1%) are “independently wealthy.” That is to say, they never DEPEND on an employer or the government for their financial wherewithal. They own so much wealth producing capital that they can live off their dividends without ever having to consider taking a job, going to work, or punching a time-clock. Instead, they are effectively FREE to do what they want to do with their days, weeks, months, years, and their lives. That includes running for President of the United States if and when they simply choose to do so. But most Americans (95%) are NOT INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY. Most Americans were not born with silver spoons in their mouths. Most have to figure out how to make a living, how to feed, clothe, and house themselves and their family members. Most have to take jobs and depend on employers for their financial wherewithal. In other words, most Americans ARE NOT FREE in the way that Bush, Romney and Trump are free because they don’t own the dividend producing capital assets that allow the wealthy to be independent and free. But in this age of unprecedented technological advancement, in a moment when mankind could actually destroy the entire human race with the push of a button, what would you say to an economic advancement that would significantly loosen the economic chains on everyone and give everyone a taste of freedom that only the wealthy enjoy today? And what if in the process we could systematically eliminate the economic roots of poverty, racism, and war? If you’d like to significantly increase your own odds, not to mention the odds of future generations, of avoiding the chains of wage slavery, economic sharecropping, being owned instead of owning, check out the following scenario and seriously consider the possibilities. Let’s Start With These Facts The US Federal Reserve makes an annual assessment with regard to how much money will be required to fund the following year’s economic growth. In 2018 they concluded that 2019’s economic growth would require approximately $4 trillion dollars-worth of funding. If you divide $4 trillion dollars by 330 million people (US population in 2018) you’ll find that approximately $12,000 per individual citizen was going to be required to fund America’s projected economic growth in 2019. But the beneficiaries of this annual projected growth opportunity are inevitably limited to those people who can afford to fund/buy - thus own the stocks, bonds, real estate, and technological developments that account for this growth. More specifically we’re talking about less than 10% of Americans who have the means to take advantage of this relatively predictable growth, and 90% who lack the means to participate. Thus, we now have a 21st century wealth gap that is wider and more toxic than any time since the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression which followed in its wake. To make matters worse, this was the case long before the current pandemic oriented economic crisis raised its ugly head. In response to millions of workers losing their incomes and healthcare due to the virus, the Federal government increased unemployment benefits, and issued so called “stimulus checks” to millions of people in an effort to artificially jump-start demand and to prevent the ship of state from sinking into oblivion. Unpalatable But Necessary Steps In taking these unpalatable but necessary steps the government has significantly increased the already massive debt load, which means it’s a short-term not a long-term solution. The hope of course was to artificially resuscitate demand, which in turn should recreate jobs and get we the people back to work and lead us all back to where we were before the virus struck. The problem is that, even before the virus struck, we the people were not in a very good place. Even before the virus erupted over half of all Americans were living paycheck to paycheck, unable to afford a $500 bump in the road without having to borrow money in order to pay for it. Things are dramatically worse now than they were before the virus began. But the place we were is still not the place to which we the people are longing to return. So, what can we do? The $4 Trillion Dollar Idea That Creates No Long-Term Debt! Now let’s recall that back in 2019 America’s economic growth was going to require $4 trillion dollars of funding. Once again, that translated into about $12,000 every year for every man, woman, and child in America. But the beneficiaries of this relatively predictable, annual growth are those who can afford to buy the patents, copyrights, stocks, bonds, real estate, and new technology that account for this growth. This excludes over 90% of we the people. The question I want to raise now is, how can we make sure the average American has systematic access to the ownership side of the economy, where ALL THE NEW WEALTH IS BEING GENERATED? How can the average Joe gain access to that $4 trillion dollars of predictable growth in order to generate a second stream of investment income, while eliminating the fear and instability that so many Americans suffer from in today’s incredibly imbalanced economy? Consider the Following Possibility… •	What if the Federal Reserve, through local banks… •	Made an annual, 100% insured, $10,000 LINE OF CREDIT accessible •	to every single American citizen (man, woman, and child regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or political persuasion) •	at ZERO PERCENT INTEREST, and… •	allowed these annual loans to be repaid with FUTURE, PRE-TAX DIVIDENDS – NOT PERSONAL SAVINGS •	along with a stipulation that these funds could ONLY BE USED to purchase shares of new and transferred capital assets that were predicted to generate enough future profits to pay for themselves in a predictable amount of time (3 to 7 years) and create predictable, stabilizing, capital incomes for their owners? This strategy, known as “Economic Democracy,” would cost American taxpayers NOTHING. Since every transaction would be instantly collateralized by private sector assets and 100% insured, it creates no long-term consumer debt and no long-term government debt either. And it WOULD NOT BE INFLATIONARY? Inflation happens when too many dollars are chasing too few goods and services. But in the EDA scenario, production systematically precedes consumption. Thus, there’s a systematic balance built into this strategy which eliminates any possibility of inflationary imbalances. What Economic Democracy Will Do However Is… •	Provide every American systematic access to the ownership side of the American economy, where all of our nations’ new wealth is being generated. •	Create a stream of income for all Americans thru ownership - not thru labor •	END AMERICAN POVERTY AND HEAL THE RACIAL DIVIDE •	Stabilize family life, •	Minimize the mental illness known as GREED that so poisons American culture •	In the long run it systematically democratizes the free market, •	Create millions of new taxpayers, thereby DILUTING and REDUCING the TAX BURDEN on those who actually still pay taxes •	Minimize the growing threat of artificial intelligence in Americas’ job market •	Balance the national budget, •	And yes, PAY DOWN OUR NATIONAL DEBT, reducing taxes even further. That $4 trillion of growth (or more today due to inflation) is destined to happen. The only real question is, HOW WILL IT BE FINANCED? If the billionaires finance it from past savings, they’ll own and control it. If the government finances it through taxation or debt creation, they’ll own and control it. But if we the people finance it, WE THE PEOPLE will own, control, and benefit from our ownership. And under these economic conditions a genuine political democracy is actually possible in a way that it is not today! In this moment of political division and strife Economic Democracy literally pays all Americans to pull together, at the same time, in the same direction, towards the same goals! It translates mere political talk (such as…we’re all in this together) into real live, results driven action! It Systematically Counteracts Concentrated Wealth/Greed! Over time, each American citizen will accumulate more equity, more capital income, and benefit from their investment income in a way that only the wealthy can today. As the result, the need for federally backed social safety net programs (i.e. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps) will gradually fade into the sunset. Millions more will be able to pay taxes, which in turn decreases the burden on those among us who currently pay taxes. It systematically counteracts concentrated wealth/greed as it gradually democratizes America’s free-market economy! Economic Democracy In Detail I confess, this commentary has been a generalized portrait and is in dire need of more detail. So, for a full and detailed explanation of how this strategy could be implemented, go to CESJ.ORG and check out the concept that Dr. Norman Kurland calls the ECONOMIC DEMOCRACY ACT. It’s an ingenious idea whose time is long overdue. And it’s one very good thing that could actually come to fruition as the result of this horrific, COVID 19 crisis. Addendum… UBI vs. Economic Democracy Comparison Stimulus checks are effectively a short-term form of Universal Basic Income (UBI), an idea which has been advocated by among others, former presidential hopeful and serial entrepreneur Andrew Yang, as well as Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, and Elon Musk of Tesla. Although their goals are similar, the ways they achieve those goals are dramatically different. Check it out. Since 0% interest, 100% insured lines of credit are repaid via pre-tax future earnings, and can only be used to buy wealth producing capital assets, Economic Democracy creates no long-term consumer debt and no long-term government debt. UBI creates government debt that will eventually be paid back by we the people (not the 1% who are spectacular at avoiding taxes) in the form of higher taxes. Economic Democracy systematically creates universal capital ownership opportunity and access to the means of acquiring wealth producing capital assets. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically finances predictable and sustainable growth of the economy. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables individual citizens to become economically empowered and liberated (FREE) through capital ownership. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically enables citizens to become economically independent (FREE) of the government. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically generates mass purchasing power through ever-broadening citizen ownership of income producing capital. UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates new owners of advanced technologies and green growth assets UBI does not. Economic Democracy systematically creates a growing tax base to pay the costs of government, thereby eliminating deficit spending and eventually paying off the currently massive government debt. UBI does not. UBI/Stimulus checks are simple and immediate. That’s their strength. Economic Democracy requires a little time (generally 3 to 7 years) in order for benefits to begin accumulating. That’s why UBI should start immediately and be phased out over time in favor of Economic Democracy (a.k.a. Universal Basic Ownership/UBO)."
7,Psychopathy of seduction,social-issues," Picking up woman is nothing but mind games. Sure, being rich and good looking helps but when you see average looking men with beautiful woman, it does beg the question, how do they do that? Supreme clothing, and Hermes handbags, once were or still are highly looked upon items of fashion that many are begging to get their hands on. With limited releases that mean it is difficult to obtain and high prices which cannot be justified even if the quality is three times better than something one one-hundredth of the price. So why do people love them so much? Why are people trying so hard, waiting for the release and trying to have the fastest fingers, or purchasing thousands to even be considered for a handbag, just to give a company their money? Yet the companies are making millions, from doing this on purpose. Why are you actively convincing a woman that you are a good enough option when in reality, you should be the one getting pursued? The approach Keep it casual and confident, walk up to the woman you would like to pursue, small introduction and then just start talking about something completely random, point out the awkward couple trying to hit it off with each other and laugh with her, make little jokes about the décor of the room your in. Do it all with the tone of voice you speak to your mates in, friendly body language and taking the conversation completely off yourselves at first will psychologically make her feel like you’re someone she’s known for years and is completely comfortable with, thereby removing any first encounter awkwardness. Furthermore, this gives off the impression that you’re not nervous, you don’t care about what she thinks, you’re not trying to brag or take a fake interest in her life, and it either works or it doesn’t.  You are not trying to win her because in your mind you don’t care at all about her opinion. This completely removes the power from her side of the court that she’s used to holding. So, you must be different, you must be special. Making her yours. Ever wonder why some woman are always in relationships? Some woman just goes from long term to long term boyfriends, and as soon as its over it seem like they are with someone new straight away? Talking to these woman is usually a mixture of your first thoughts that she isn’t that special to you falling in love. These woman aren’t any different to any other woman you meet and yet you and all the men around her seem to fall in love. Just like the limited releases of clothing previously mentioned, it’s almost like these woman are limited release, and when you see someone else with the thing that you know you can’t have then for some reason it just seems better and better. I mean everyone knows you want what you can’t have and that is completely it. You can’t have the woman, so you want her, then as soon as more men want her, she seems even more desirable and this example also works for woman looking at men. If you aren’t always available for this woman then she’s going to want you even more. Practical application of this can be incredibly simple. Not being there whenever the woman, you’re trying to pursue wants you, will just make her want you even more. Just doing things like rebooking a date you were meant to go on or ending her call but calling her back later on just means you aren’t always there when she wants you to be. However, failure to be available at all will just mean she may lose interest so don’t overuse this technique. Sometimes if you feel like you are being played by a woman and she’s just stringing you along, finding someone new short term can show that you aren’t always available, as well as creating a sense of urgency and when you are actually available."
