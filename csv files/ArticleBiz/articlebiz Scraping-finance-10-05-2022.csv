0,Three great cTrader features,finance," Are you sick of looking at an outdated MT4 platform? Do you feel limited by what online social trading platforms like TradingView have to offer? Have you outgrown your brokers proprietary platform? If the answer to those questions is yes, then it may be worth testing out the cTrader platform. For those who haven’t heard of cTrader before, it is the challenger platform solution for Forex and CFD trading developed by Spotware. The platform, like most others, is available across all devices and operating systems, including the web. In addition, it gives you full charting capabilities, easy to use interface, economic calendar information that you would expect from a trading platform in 2022. What sets cTrader apart from the competition is its copy trade options, cTrader automate algorithmic solution and its FIX API connection. The latter feature, when combined with a true ECN broker, truly gives you unparalleled direct access to full depth and breadth of the Forex and CFD markets when you trade. This includes level 2 pricing to get true insight into what buyers and sellers are doing. For those with little time to track financial markets developments, come up with trading strategies of their own, or just don’t have the time to trade manually, cTrader copy trade functionality provides the perfect solution. The platform provides hundreds of trading strategies to follow and detailed statistics around their performance. Plus, you get to choose the risk level you want to take with equity stop losses. If developing your own trading algorithms is your focus, then cTrader Automate is a great solution. You can develop algorithms straight on the cTrader platform as well as test and optimise them. What’s more, cTrader Automate works with the C# programming language. There is no need to learn platform specific languages skills as you do with MT4’s MQL4, which has no practical use elsewhere. In my next article, I will discuss one of my favourite benefits of cTrader, the ability to track your trading performance without having to use external software like myFXBook or FXBlue. Traders commonly overlook the need to understand their performance statistics. Yet performance tracking is critical to fine tuning your trading performance."
1,Is Now the Time to Consider a Buy-to-Let Property Investment?,finance," Sky-high fuel bills and record inflation have hit UK households hard. For many, now simply is not the time to be considering major purchases and investments. As making ends meet becomes a real struggle across the UK, would-be investors are putting their plans on hold for the time being at least. Meanwhile, the UK’s buy-to-let property market is performing on a level not seen for several years. Even in the face of fewer tax incentives and higher costs for landlords, the private rental sector remains a comparatively safe haven for property investments. But does this mean that now is the right time for first-time investors to buy into the booming BTL property market? Is taking the plunge today advisable, or would it be better to wait out the current uncertainty and see what the coming years bring? A Fast-Paced, Highly Competitive Sector You need only look at the growth the UK’s private renting sector has achieved over recent years to understand its appeal. Since 2017, the sector’s total combined value has increased by a huge £239 billion. Research suggests that as of 2022, the BTL sector is now worth in excess of £1.7 trillion. Despite these recent hurdles, UK property investors appear undaunted. Since 2017 the value of the buy-to-let sector has risen by around £239 billion to reach £1.7 trillion, according to new research. “There have been many challenges that have subdued investment into the private rented sector over the past few years,” commented Stephen Clark of bridging finance company Finbri “But the sector has proved resilient, and we have seen continued demand for finance in this vibrant part of the economy.” If anything, economic uncertainty has only served as a catalyst for the BTL market’s performance. Even during the height of the pandemic, average house prices in the UK continued to skyrocket. From March 2020 to December 2021, the average market value of a home in the UK increased by 16%. Figures which suggest that come what may, buying into the UK’s property market almost always translates to significant capital gains long-term. Lenders Welcome BTL Investors Qualifying for a conventional mortgage from a mainstream lender has become increasingly difficult. By contrast, many lenders are throwing their doors open to new and established BTL landlords in a way not seen in some time. Last year alone, the number of specialist mortgage products available for buy-to-let investments rose from 1,311 up to 2,235. Meanwhile, average five-year fixed interest rates have been hovering around the same 3.5%, falling slightly to 3.47% in February this year. “The BTL sector has faced its share of upheaval and changes to regulations and requirements, so it is highly encouraging to see that providers are still keen to attract first-time landlords,” said Eleanor Williams on behalf of Moneyfacts. All of which paints a picture of a BTL sector that is not just profitable, but also surprisingly accessible. With house prices and monthly rents set to continue rising across the UK indefinitely, now could indeed be the time to consider buying into the country’s booming BTL property market."
2,How To Apply For Bankruptcy Online In The UK,finance," Anyone declaring bankruptcy in the UK must now apply online instead of directly to the court. In this article, we explain how the online application process works and offer some useful tips to help you complete it. Getting started You start your bankruptcy application at the Government’s official website. You’ll need to set up an online account using your name, email address and three security questions. You’ll then be sent a 12-digit application number which you can use to log into your application at any time, so you don’t need to complete everything in one go. What to expect The first thing you’ll see when you set up your account is the Application Overview page. This is divided into 8 sections: Personal details Employment Bank accounts and savings Assets Money you owe Income and expenses Legal proceedings Debt history Providing the information You can’t look at the next section until you’ve completed the previous one, so you can’t see what details you need to provide in advance. We suggest gathering the following information before you start, to help you complete your application as quickly as possible: •	National Insurance number. •	Employment information including wage and salary details, and/or details of any self-employed activities within the last 3 years. •	Bank and building society account details and balances for all accounts held within the last 2 years. •	Information on your current assets and any you’ve disposed of within the last 5 years. This can get quite complicated, but you’ll generally need to provide information on anything you own that’s worth over £500. E.g. property, cars, antiques, furniture etc. You’ll also need to list any pending compensation and legal claims; interests in any wills and trusts; stocks, shares and investments; business assets; and any money you’re owed. •	Letters and statements from creditors and debt collection agencies, including information about any legal action being taken against you. •	Information about your monthly income and outgoings. For income, this includes benefits, tax credits, wage or salary payments, pension income and so on. Outgoings can be more difficult as everyone’s expenses vary from month to month. Have all your monthly and quarterly bills to hand, and use your bank and card statements to work out other costs, such as food, fuel and clothes. •	Details of any ongoing legal claims, or proceedings such as divorce that have occurred within the last 5 years. •	Information about any debt solutions you’ve used in the last 5 years, such as Debt Management or an IVA. This includes any previous bankruptcies. What happens next? Once you’ve completed all the required information and paid your bankruptcy fees (which can now be paid in instalments), you can submit your application. It will be reviewed by the Adjudicator’s Office, who’ll contact you if they need any more information. You should get a response within a few days. You’ll be told about the Adjudicator’s decision by email. If your Bankruptcy Order has gone ahead, you can view it by logging into your online account. Hints and tips •	If you don’t have a computer, there’s normally one you can use at your local library for a small fee. •	If you can’t afford bankruptcy fees, you may be able to apply for a grant at the Turn2us website. •	Do your best to provide full, honest and accurate information. It’s a criminal offence to withhold or knowingly provide false information on a bankruptcy application, which includes concealing assets. •	However, there may be some details you can’t provide, such as the exact date you opened a bank account. Just be as accurate as you can. •	Don’t worry if you genuinely forget to include some of your debts. These will all be covered by your Bankruptcy Order once it’s made. We suggest you get a copy of your credit record which should list most of your debts and will also show any that have been sold to debt collection agencies. •	When listing personal possessions, don’t include items you can use that are owned by someone else. For example, a car you’re insured on that’s owned by your partner. •	Make a note of any grey areas you’re not sure about, or any information you realise you should have provided after your application has been submitted. You can discuss these details with the Official Receiver in your interview after your Bankruptcy Order has been made."
3,Monthly Financial Meetings: Here’s Why They Matter,finance," Would you zoom through a roadtrip without stopping to take a breather and make sure you aren't straying off course? Of course not! Chances are, your pit stops include glancing at your GPS, analyzing your progress, and maybe even checking your vehicle to make sure everything is still functioning. You might notice your tank is almost empty and add some more fuel, or maybe reevaluate your route to see if there is a more strategic way to get to your destination. So when it comes to your business - and more specifically, your financials - why do you continue speeding through, without taking the necessary time to ensure that your team is still effective and on track? Here at Blueprint CFO, we believe that monthly financial meetings are a key element to the success of a company's Profitability Roadmap process. Here's why. Just as you wouldn't want to embark on a major trip without checking your GPS to make sure you didn't enter in the wrong location, establishing regular checkpoints to ensure accounting accuracy is critical to your company's profitability. Monthly financial meetings are a useful time to sit down with your financial team and address any outlying data points that need to be checked for accuracy. In addition to checking the legitimacy of everything that is on the table, monthly financial meetings are also a great time to make sure there isn't any financial information being left off the table altogether. By establishing a regular touchpoint to review and refine your accounting team's work, you can have peace of mind as a leader, knowing that your strategy is based on comprehensive, accurate, timely data that truly reflects where your business stands. Not only do monthly financial meetings encourage you as a leader to sit down and touch base on the data that drives your business, it also encourages your accounting team to return to their core responsibility: maintaining accountability throughout your business. After all, as we've shared in the past, there is no accountability without great accounting. Beyond establishing accountability in the form of accuracy, monthly financial meetings also drive your accounting team to start thinking strategically. As your accounting team collects and reviews your company's data, they can bring a new perspective to the table by going beyond the reporting stage, analyzing trends, and identifying areas of improvement that might be overseen at the executive level. By calling on your accounting team to bring any relevant notes, insights and observations to the table at your monthly financial meetings, you will develop an organizational culture that truly prioritizes great accounting - not just great financial reporting. By bringing accounting & finance stakeholders together across all levels of your organization through your monthly financial meetings, you have an opportunity as a leader to help your team members feel more connected to your company's strategic vision. By developing touchpoints for two-way communication and collaboration, your accounting team will understand that they are so much more than the ""number crunchers."" Rather, they will understand how their work helps move the needle forward, and how their role connects to the business's strategic Profitability Roadmap, and overall growth."
4,How To Become A Financially Responsible Adult,finance," There is no single answer to becoming a financially responsible adult, but there are certain steps that can help. Here are 13 tips for getting started: The first step to becoming more financially responsible is to create and stick to a budget. This means tracking your expenses and income so that you can see where your money is going. It can be a challenge to stick to a budget, but it’s worth it in the long run. An emergency fund is essential for anyone looking to become more financially responsible. This is money that you set aside for unexpected expenses, such as car repairs or medical bills. Try to save up enough money to cover at least three to six months’ worth of expenses. One of the best ways to become more financially responsible is to invest in yourself. This could mean taking courses on personal finance, or learning how to save and budget effectively. The more knowledge you have, the better equipped you’ll be to make smart financial decisions. One of the key tenets of being financially responsible is living below your means. This means spending less than you earn and saving the difference. It may be difficult at first, but it will pay off in the long run. Another important part of being financially responsible is avoiding debt. Credit card debt, in particular, can be difficult to pay off and can damage your credit score. Try to avoid borrowing money whenever possible and work on paying off any outstanding debts you may have. 6.Invest Wisely Investing is another important part of becoming a financially responsible adult. When done correctly, investing can help you grow your money over time. However, it’s important to do your research before investing in any products or services. In order to make smart financial decisions, it’s important to stay informed. This means reading up on personal finance topics, watching financial news, and talking to experts. The more you know about money, the better equipped you’ll be to handle your finances. One of the simplest ways to become more financially responsible is to pay your bills on time. This includes credit card bills, rent, and utilities. Many people don’t take advantage of the benefits they have at work. This could include things like health insurance, 401k plans, and flexible spending accounts. Make sure you know what benefits are available to you and how to use them. The final step to becoming a financially responsible adult is to stay disciplined. This means making smart financial decisions even when it’s not easy. It takes time and effort to become financially responsible, but it’s worth it in the end. Working a side gig is a great way to make extra money and become more financially responsible. This could be anything from freelancing to dog walking. The more money you can bring in, the better off you’ll be. If you want to become more financially responsible, one of the best things you can do is get a promotion or a raise. This will give you more money to work with and help you save for the future. One of the best ways to become more financially responsible is to set financial goals. These could be things like saving for a down payment on a house or retirement. Having something to work towards will help you stay focused and motivated. These are just a few tips for becoming a more financially responsible adult. By following these steps, you can begin to take control of your finances and start building a brighter future for yourself."
5,Tie Up Your Financial Loose Ends! The Importance of Managing High-Interest Loans,finance," Are high-interest loans leaving you on a never-ending spiral? Strategic business growth begins with well-managed financials, and managing your loans is no exception. While paying off loans can be a source of great stress for many business owners, tying up your financial loose ends can mean the difference between endlessly owing money to your lenders, and elevating your company to the next level. The question is this: are your accounting systems and processes up to standard? If not, chances are you are paying much more on loans than you should be. Our team at Blueprint CFO can help! Here is one example. When the Blueprint CFO began working with a local building supplies contractor client, the firm had three outstanding loans: Loan #1 (40% APR), Loan #2 (55% APR), and Loan #3 (25% APR). Because the firm had to make weekly payments on these loans, they had continued cash flow issues. The company also found themselves in a Catch-22, stuck in a never-ending cycle of acquiring loans — with even higher rates — to pay off the previous loans. There seemed to be no end in sight. In auditing our client’s financials, the Blueprint CFO team found that the company’s books weren’t properly prepared, which led them to experience a number of issues, including their loan-related predicament. While the company utilized Quickbooks Desktop to issue invoices and bills, the firm did not have a cohesive record of its expenses, assets, equipment rentals, etc. Moreover, their bank accounts had not been reconciled for three years. The Blueprint CFO team responded to this in a number of ways. First, we improved automation and created an up-to-date view of relevant data by transferring the company’s numbers from Quickbooks Desktop to Quickbooks Online. This allowed our client to have a clearer view of their records so we could work towards a new financial strategy — one that would truly lead to growth and profitability. We then built high-integrity financial statements and records, which increased bank confidence in the company. This led to acquiring a loan from a Regional Bank with a LIBOR rate of + 2%, interest-free for the first year. As a result, the company could pay off all outstanding loans, saving them $150,000 in 2021 interest expenses. With their new financials, our client also now qualifies to apply for their PPP loan payoff as well as the new California Grant. All in all, our rockstar accounting team at Blueprint CFO was able to rebuild the client’s books and reconcile their bank and credit card accounts, resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of savings. We can help you do the same! With our signature Profitability Roadmap formula, our all-star team of accountants at Blueprint CFO can help you make sure you have the systems and processes in place to set your business up for success."
