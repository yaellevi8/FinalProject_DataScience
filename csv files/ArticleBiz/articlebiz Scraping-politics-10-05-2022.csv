0,A Question for Moderate Republicans,politics," I have been voting for a very long time. Sometimes democrats won and sometimes republicans won. The issues that we voted on then were simple. Republicans voted for fiscal responsibility and lower taxes and democrats voted to improve social conditions for their own families and for the families of all Americans at risk.  Both parties were sincere in their opinions about what was best for the country. America’s strength was about working on compromises to find the best solution that both parties could agree on. Recently the Republican Party has changed. It is now about gaining power and putting into effect their own values and their own opinions on all issues by any means that they can, even when a majority of the voters may not agree with them. Many long-time republicans and also recent moderate republicans are becoming concerned about the direction their party is taking.  Moderate republicans love our democracy just as democrats and independents do, and don’t want to lose the rights we have all fought so hard to win for all of our citizens. They don't really want to vote for the authoritarian leaders their party is backing. They don’t like the campaign of hate and disinformation that their party is using to win at any cost. The question now for more moderate republicans in our country is what will they do with their vote in the coming elections? Moderate republicans are now faced with a difficult decision. If they don’t feel that they can vote either republican or democratic then their only option would be not to vote at all in the next few elections until their party again becomes the strong and valued party that they have always loved and remembered from the past. Will moderate Republicans choose to do the right thing that they feel will save our democracy or will they do the expedient thing and vote with a party that they know is on a wrong and dangerous path? That is the challenging question that many moderate republicans are asking themselves now? The answer to that difficult question has yet to be determined."
1,Fake News,politics," Fake News We hear a great deal these days about misinformation, disinformation, and fake news.  It is leading some people to question the first amendment guarantee on freedom of expression.  This is understandable; after all, it’s only a small step from hate crimes to hate speech.  The above mentioned terms are difficult to define, however, I can think of some concrete historical examples which may give us some insight into understanding the larger concepts.  Let’s start with Ukraine in the 1930’s. Upton Sinclair, a famous progressive writer in the early part of the 20th Century, visited Russia in the 1920’s.  Upon his return to the United States, he stated, “I have seen the future, and it works.”  Sinclair may have been honestly duped, but Walter Duranty knew better.  Duranty was a writer for the famed New York Times who was sent to Russia in 1922 and stayed until 1936.  What we knew about what was happening in Russia during those years, we got from Duranty.  First, let’s take a look at a few facts.  There was a massive famine in the early 1930’s, mainly in Ukraine but also in Russia itself.  There is general agreement that the horrors were brought on by the policies of communist dictator Joseph Stalin.  Three to four million died of starvation in Ukraine and two to three million in Russia.  It was so bad in Ukraine that cannibalism was a common occurrence.  According to the reporting of Duranty, everything was fine.  He absolutely denied there was any problem whatsoever.  His articles, more or less, maintained that there is nothing to see here.  To make matter worse, he heaped scorn on another reporter who had directly witnessed what was taking place.  To add insult to injury, Duranty received a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 during the height of the famine. Herbert Matthews, another Times reporter, did a Duranty imitation of his own in 1957 when he interviewed guerilla leader Fidel Castro of Cuba.  In his article Matthews portrayed Castro in the best possible light.  He said Castro had a massive army, the majority of the people were on his side, and he was not a communist.  He went so far as to say that Castro was actually an anti-Communist.  After Castro took over Cuba in 1959, Matthews continued to proclaim the noncommunist nature of the new government.  He was still holding to this position into 1960 when Castro himself put an end to the nonsense by coming out of the closet and declaring himself a proud communist. Many people alive today remember the energy crisis of the 1970’s.  It was a time of gas shortages, long lines at the pump, and surging prices.  To conserve energy President Nixon instituted day light savings time the year around (it only lasted one year) and set the speed limit at 55.  President Carter told Americans to shiver in the winter and sweat profusely in the summer.  Looking back, it seems fairly obvious that the problem was instability in the Middle East and government control over the price of oil.  However, we were told by the government, the media, and academia that the world was running out of oil.  I personally bought in to this line of reasoning; it seemed entirely logical.  Demand for oil across the board was through the roof, and there is a limited amount of fossil fuel.  I remember a conversation I had with a friend during the 70’s in which I stated that oil was running out.  She said, “There’s plenty of oil!”  I thought she sounded ignorant, but I was the one who was uninformed.  It’s been almost 50 since that conversation, and we still have plenty of oil.  Regardless of how one feels about climate change and other related issues regarding fossil fuels, we were not running out of oil in the 1970’s. George W. Bush, for whatever reason, was determined to get rid of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  At first the government through Vice President Dick Cheney tried to tie Hussein to Al Qaeda.  That didn’t work; there was simply no evidence.  Then, they fell back on weapons of mass destruction.  Bush and the CIA claimed that Iraq had chemical weapons and was pursuing a nuclear capability.  The intellectual community was convinced, and the rest is history.  There was no investigative reporting on the part of the media as they bought the argument hook, line, and sinker.  Of course, it was all a lie.  The only thing relating to weapons of mass destruction the U. S. Army found when it invaded Iraq was a mobile lab which contained a few high school type solutions and materials. There is and always has been an abundance of fake news.  It’s the public’s job to sort things out, and it usually can.  We most always say, “Hey that sounds silly.”  The problem comes in when the fake news is supported by the media and the government.  When that happens, it can have catastrophic consequences."
2,Politics at Trinity High School,politics," Politics at Trinity High School Those who know me realize I am a very conservative person politically.  When I attended a teacher In-Service after being hired by Trinity High School in 1985 at age 39, I realized I was entering a liberal environment.  A couple of my new colleagues were talking about how horrible the South African government was.  Shortly afterwards in teacher conferences, the principal (Sr. Stephanie Warren) subjected us to some women’s liberation theories.  Some revolved around spouse abuse and how it was caused by a patriarchal society.  Others concerned language and its sexist nature.  I talked to my dad about these developments, and he advised me to go about my job and keep my mouth shut.  Since I needed the job, I decided to take his advice. In looking back, Sr. Stephanie was in many ways ahead of her time.  In 1985, most of her beliefs were considered off the rails; now, they are the norm.  She was also very much an advocate of the nuclear freeze movement.  The year before, when she was just a teacher, she went to the Trinity Board and asked it to take a stand on this issue.  Tom Isbill, one of the Board members, told her to come back when the Soviet Union no longer posed a threat. Anthony Scola was the assistant principal at Trinity.  Anthony was what one might call an old hippie with an effeminate personality and a keen sense of humor.  He was also an intellectual type who could be very aggressive.  You didn’t want to disagree with Anthony; he could cut you down to size in no time flat.  He was a former priest who in his younger years had opposed the war in Vietnam.  Eventually he left the priesthood and the Catholic Church altogether.  He married a former nun (Margaret) who also left the church, and they both became Quakers.  The simple and pacifist lifestyle of the Brotherhood appealed to their sense of right and wrong. Margaret taught at St. Mary’s, one of the grade schools connected to Trinity.  She was also an old hippie who supposedly went so far as refusing to shave her legs or under her arms.  Originally the Scolas were from Milwaukee, but they wanted to get away from the fast paced urban life.  When they were hired to teach at Trinity and St. Mary’s in Whitesville, Kentucky; the town was too big for them so they settled in Deanefield, a smaller community to the southeast.  Whitesville contains about 600 people while Deanefield has less than 100. I discovered there was a divide between the administrators and clergy of Trinity on the one hand and the parents and students on the others.  In 1988 the Evansville Bosse basketball team, mostly Black, traveled to face a mostly White Heritage Hills team.  There had been a history of bad blood between the two schools.  On their journey, the Bosse team noticed burning crosses along the side of the highway.  Sr. Stephanie and some of her fellow sisters who taught at Trinity expressed horror over the situation.  Later I overheard some Trinity parents laughing and hee-hawing about the same incident. Sr. Stephanie left Trinity after four years as principal.  Despite my disagreement with her ideology, I had no problem with her as a person or a superior.  She gave me a job when I needed one, promoted me to athletic director after just one year, and always treated me with respect.  Several times she went to bat for me in disciplinary and personality clash situations.  Her replacement was Dan Fuller, a well traveled school administrator who came to Trinity from Florida.  At first glance he appeared to be more of the same.  In a document he submitted to the Board explaining his philosophy, he used feminine pronouns to refer to non-gender antecedents. Dan was a unique individual.  The students loved him and he commanded their respect.  They called him ‘Dan the Man.’  From an academic standpoint, he and W. A. Franklin (an Ohio County assistant principal) were the most scholarly and well read administrators with whom I have ever been associated.  However, he gave the students an inordinate amount of freedom, and after one year the teachers were a bit upset.  On her principal evaluation form, one teacher included the statement, “Less ‘Dan the Man’ and more Mr. Fuller.”  Some concerned teachers led by Anthony Scola and Sr. Lorraine Lauter (a religion instructor) tried to have Dan fired.  When the attempt failed, Anthony took a one year sabbatical at the University of Kentucky in order to work on a degree in Spanish. During Dan’s first year, Sr. Dianna Ortiz (a friend of Sr. Lorraine) claimed she was kidnapped, tortured, and raped by America’s allies in Guatemala.  Sr. Lorraine arranged for the school to have a special assembly to address the issue.  She turned the assembly into an America bashing session in which United States foreign policy was depicted as evil and sinister.  I sat in the back, and as the negativity toward the United States became intense, I shook my head in disbelief and disgust.  At one point I looked over at Dan who was sitting across from me, and he was cracking up with laughter at my response.  I interpreted this as meaning I had a friend and ally.  It turned out that I was correct because next year he promoted me to dean of students. Margaret Scola, Anthony’s wife, got involved in a running debate with a grade school colleague over the Gulf War of 1991.  She said we needed to give sanctions more time before going to war.  Jamie Clark, her colleague, challenged her by saying, “I can’t think of a worse way to die than starving.”  When Anthony returned from his sabbatical, Dan saddled him with the worst possible classes; they were chock full of troublemakers.  Anthony challenged the scheduling, but the Board upheld Dan.  A few years later, Anthony and Margaret resigned to become African missionaries.  They were stationed in Sudan, and I feared for their safety.  Nothing bad happened; however, as they both attended a Trinity graduation in the mid-90’s.  Also leaving were Sr. Lorraine and Sr. Theresa Henry (another liberation theology advocate).  With these departures, liberalism at Trinity pretty much ceased to exist. Shortly after his third year began, Dan himself resigned to take a principal’s position in Maine.  As chief disciplinarian I basically had the run of the school for the remainder of the year.  Another teacher (Katie Williams) was appointed interim principal, but she gave me the freedom to operate as I saw fit.  In 1992 John Calhoun was hired as principal.  He was a Ross Perot type of conservative, and we were off to the races. There was a bit of backsliding in 2000 when Mike Clark became principal.  Even though Mike was liberal, he did not make a point of advancing a political agenda.  However, one of his hires as a religion teacher did.  One day I noticed a document in my mailbox which was full of propaganda about how military spending was ruining America.  When I complained to the secretary about such items being placed in our personal spaces, she told me it was done by Bob Nicodemus, the religion instructor.  I then confronted Bob, and we became involved in a ferocious argument.  He defended the propaganda and his actions by comparing it to sending a Christmas card.  The argument went on and on, and we ended up yelling at each other.  Anyway, Bob left after one year, and Mike was gone as principal after two.  Afterwards, we returned to normal. It is appropriate in light of current tendencies that I end with a story about the national anthem.  In 1992 Trinity’s girls’ basketball team was playing in a Christmas Tournament at Brescia University.  As athletic director I was always looking to schedule our teams in such tournaments.  Barry McArdle, a public relations and recruitment specialist at Brescia, organized the event; and we played in it for a couple of years.  Shortly before our first game in the 1992 tournament, Barry came to me and said they would not be playing the national anthem.  Instead, a Brescia student would sing “God Bless America.”  He said, “After all, Larry, the national anthem glorifies violence.”  He then asked if what they were doing was okay with me.  I simply responded, “It’s your tournament!”  A short time later, a young Brescia student came to the scorers’ table visibly upset.  She said Mr. McArdle had just ordered her to sing both “God Bless America” and the national anthem even though she had not practiced the “Star Spangled Banner.”  This was probably my most satisfying point in the political wars at Trinity High School."
3,Explaining Civil Litigation,politics," Lawyers can build their careers across various fields, from family lawyers to corporate attornies. One common field of practice is civil litigation. Civil litigation attorneys work with cases with no criminal charges or penalties. Instead, civil litigation attorneys work with various kinds of non-criminal legal disputes in which plaintiffs are looking for some sort of compensation or damages. Read on to learn more about what it means to work as a civil litigator! What Kinds of Cases Do Litigators Handle? As mentioned above, civil litigators handle non-criminal legal disputes. This encompasses many different kinds of cases, so most lawyers working in civil litigation have just a couple of areas of expertise. Civil litigation cases might include landlord and tenant disputes, personal injury claims, intellectual property disputes, medical malpractice claims, education law disputes, and more. Unlike in criminal cases, where the prosecution has to present evidence that proves their case beyond a reasonable doubt, civil litigation trials only require convincing evidence. What Skills Do Litigators Need? Civil litigation requires similar skills as other areas of law. Litigators need to have extensive knowledge of local and federal laws related to their area of practice, strong communication skills, negotiation skills, and more. Negotiation can be critical in litigation cases. Many litigation cases never go to trial, so negotiating terms to resolve the issue outside of the courtroom is a crucial skill. What Are the Steps to a Litigation Case? When a client hires a litigator for their case, the case goes through a particular process, just as in any legal procedure. When a potential client wants to pursue civil litigation against another party, their first step is to meet with a litigation attorney to discuss the case. The attorney will help explain the process and evaluate whether or not the client has a strong case. From there, if the client decides to proceed with the case, the attorney will do extensive research to build evidence. This will be followed by both involved parties filing pleadings, essentially explaining their sides of the issue. Once the court has received both pleadings, the case will enter the discovery stage. This is essentially an extension of the research phase, including witness interviews and fact gathering for each side to build their case. The discovery stage usually takes the most time. Once discovery is complete, the case enters pre-trial, which is the last step for many cases. In pre-trial, the attorneys for both the plaintiff and defendant begin negotiations, trying to reach an acceptable settlement outside of court. If an agreement cannot be reached, the trial will go to court, and a judge will decide the matter."
4,There is a problem with Ukraine,politics," There is a problem with Ukraine There is something going on in Ukraine which is just not as it appears.  Sophistication, complexity, and intrigue are the three best words to describe this beleaguered country.  To begin, there are essentially four main forces that are driving events in the nation.  They all compete with one another and have different agendas but have been drawn together to present a united front. First and foremost are foreign NGO’s and American foreign policy operatives.  Their goal is to make Ukraine a liberal democracy that will eventually achieve integration into NATO and the European Union.  These people are extremely efficient, and they have outflanked their opponents both in Ukraine and the outside world.  They effectively brought about two Revolutions, the Orange (2005) and the Maidan (2014).  At this point in time, they have established the narrative which a vast majority of the American public accept as fact. A few examples are worth noting.  Victoria Nuland was the State Department employee tasked with the overall implementation of American’s Ukraine policy.  During the Maidan Revolution, she was caught on tape organizing a new government and arranging who would be placed in key positions.  Most on the ideological spectrum agree that corruption in Ukraine has been a persistent problem.  Marie Yovanovitch, U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine from 2016-19, told Ukrainian officials who they could and could not investigate for corruption.  Vice President Joe Biden was the point man for Ukraine in the Obama Administration.  He threatened to withhold one billion dollars in aid if Ukraine did not fire a prosecutor who was investigating certain entities.  One important target under investigation was Burisma, a company that employed Biden’s son.  Alexander Vindman was a U. S. military and intelligence figure active in Ukraine.  He was so involved in security arrangements in the country that he was offered a leadership position in its armed forces. Since 2015 the government of Ukraine has been controlled by those who believe in liberal democracy.  They make up force number two and are totally dependent on the first force in order to win support from the outside world.  They’re not much different from the political elites in the United States which is to say they believe in democracy and Capitalism.  They maintain the absolute sovereignty of the people to decide their own fate irrespective of their big and powerful neighbor (Russia), and they make no concessions on territorial integrity.  All this would be fine if the country were in Western Europe, had a historically unified populous and culture, or a border that had a centuries old definition. Force number three is the oligarchs.  This group is made up of wealthy businessmen who, of course, have close ties to the first two.  Their economic power gives them leverage over the political process.  In the United States we call them billionaires.  Like Donald Trump before he was President, they have to hedge their bets by supporting those in positions of political power or those likely to be at some point.  Much of the corruption that is prevalent in Ukraine revolves around the oligarchs.  Because of their intricate connections in the government and among foreign operatives, it is difficult for the legal system to do much about their power, influence, and corruption. The fourth force is made up of fascists or Nazis.  It makes up the shock troops for the other groups.  During the Maidan Revolution, they carried the day by organizing protests, demonstrations, and violence.  They have a military force called the Azov battalion.  The battalion began as a private militia but was later incorporated into the Ukrainian army.  They are the ones who have been on the front lines in fierce fighting against Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.  It has been reported, I might add, that they have received military training from the United States.  A political party was organized by their leaders after 2015, but it received little to no support from the electorate. One might ask why the fascists would support liberal democracy.  Don’t they have more in common with Moscow than Kiev?  The answer is they can only exist in a democracy.  While democratic leaders deplore their ideology, they allow them to continue for three reasons:  they are beholden to them for support given during the Maidan Revolution, they depend on them to do the heavy fighting in Eastern Ukraine, and the ideal of democracy that all beliefs, however toxic, have the right to be expressed.  This third reason goes back to Voltaire, the great French philosopher, who stated that tolerance extends to those who believe in intolerance.  Putin, on the other hand, would have no tolerance for the Azov adherents.  He would purge them to the last man, and they know it. So what does all this have to do with American politics?  Well, actually, quite a lot!  In 2016 Donald Trump ran for President and began voicing skepticism about America fighting needless and endless wars abroad.  For Ukraine this did not look good.  To make matters worse, he hired Paul Manafort as his campaign director.  Manafort had previously worked in Ukraine as a campaign advisor for the President who was deposed in the Maidan Revolution.  At this point, Alexandra Chalupa enters the story.  Chalupa is the daughter of Ukrainian-American immigrants.  She is referred to by Wikipedia as a pro-Ukrainian activist and has worked at various times for the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.  She made it her goal to expose Manafort and thus paint the Trump campaign as a tool of Putin and Russia.  In her effort to do this, she worked with the Ukrainian government, the American Embassy in Ukraine, and allies in the United States Congress.  The project achieved some success as Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign when his Ukrainian contacts were publicly revealed. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee’s computer and the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign director, were hacked.  The contents were posted on various news sites including Wikileaks where it gained a widespread audience.  Needless to say, the material was very embarrassing to party leaders, the mainstream media, and Hillary.  Contrary to popular belief, the Committee’s computer server was not turned over to the FBI to determine the origin of the hack.  It was instead analyzed by CrowdStrike, a private cyber security firm.  Crowdstrike, not the intelligence agencies of the U. S. government, concluded that Russia was responsible for the hack. A co-founder and chief officer of CrowdStrike was Dmitri Alperovitch.  Alperovitch is a Russian who came to the United States in 1994 and later became an American citizen.  He has an intense dislike of Vladimir Putin and is a member of the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank and one of the NGO’s referred to in an earlier paragraph.  The Council makes no secret of its intent to promote liberal democracy in Ukraine and make the country a full fledged member of NATO.  One of the Ukrainian oligarchs is a significant donor to the Atlantic Council as is CrowdStrike. As is common knowledge, President Trump’s first impeachment revolved around Ukraine.  Alexander Vindman, Marie Yavonavitch and many career state department employees became star witnesses for the prosecution.  They thought Trump was blackmailing Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son who was heavily invested in Burisma (a Ukrainian energy company), and also CrowdStrike.  Trump had apparently bought into the idea promoted by many conservatives that the Democratic server had been relocated to Ukraine.  Putin may have lent credence to this idea as he supposedly told Trump that Ukraine was behind the theories advanced in the Steele Dossier that Russia was actively involved in helping Trump in the campaign of 2016. It is worth noting that Ukraine did start an investigation of Hunter Biden and Burisma after Trump was acquitted of the impeachment charges by the Senate.  After Joe Biden was elected President, however, the inquiry was dropped.  I guess this could all be justified as hedging your bets. Ukraine is now involved in a vicious war with Russia.  Ukraine may be the underdog in this fight, but it has many forces at its disposal.  The Ukrainian army is roughly equal in size to the invading Russian force, it has received drones from the West, the Trump and Biden Administrations have provided it with javelins (anti-tank weapons) and stinger missiles (anti-aircraft weapons), and its forces have received advanced military training from the West.  Whatever one may think about the two countries and its leaders, it is clear that Ukraine has important friends in high places and has decisively won the propaganda battle in the United States.  Public opinion more or less paints Ukraine as saintly and Russia as demonic.  The only other times I have seen such unanimity of opinion were after the Kennedy assassination, during the Watergate scandal, and following the events of 9/11.  And yet, I maintain based on the information presented in this article that there is a problem with Ukraine!"
5,Cyberwar History and Ukraine,politics," People are much more drawn to images of blown-up building, fires, mushroom clouds, refugees in dire circumstances, color pictures of pain that are better in black and white than they are to explanations of code or even fallout from code if it’s not resulting in something blown-up, fiery, or pictures of people in pain that are better in black and white. That is to say, while we see plenty of stories of ransomware, temporary business disruptions, and credit card & ID fraud, it’s not visceral. It goes by quickly on the page and in our minds. So, whatever happened to the stories we saw before the cyberattack age? When the US Cybercommand was  just a twinkle in some geeky eyes? What happened to the discussion that cyberattacks would engender kinetic responses? Bombs not electrons. Perhaps it was a sense of proportion. Perhaps it was a recognition that we consider that an increasing cyberwar, if responded to with bullets, might just result in use seeing those images of things that would be better in black and white on our own doorstep? Did we back off, or did sanity take hold in the minds of the planners? Let’s look at a little history. Back in 2003, a cyberattack originating from China - and christened, “Titan Rain,” by the US - managed to get access to loads of sensitive government information by compromising the systems of US government contractors and of government systems themselves. Only unclassified information was stolen, but the world woke up to this kind of attack. In 2004, the Joint Chiefs of Staff declared cyberspace an important domain of conflict alongside the air, land, sea, and space domains. No doubt, this was prompted by the reality of Titan Rain. As a culture, we were just starting to think about these things on a national level. In 2007, Estonia experienced a broad cyberattack that included their parliament, banks, and media. It was believed to have originated from Russia, or from Russian actors. NATO’s response was to create the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2007. Now, continents were beginning to wake to the threat and the need to do something about it. The Tailinn Manual The CCDCOE began to develop an extensive study and code about what how international law applies to cyber conflicts and cyberwarfare; these previous acts were beginning to be recognized as acts of war. Calling on legal scholars and legal practitioners that were experienced in cyber issues, the CCDCOE produced Tailinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in 2012. The Tailinn Manual declared that killing hackers in response to certain cyberattacks was justifiable. Killing hackers?! Meanwhile, other state-sponsored cyberattacks marched their way into the public consciousness. The Stuxnet Worm was developed to sabotage Iran’s nuclear development efforts – in particular, the centrifuges used to enrich uranium gas. It is believed to be the first malware designed to and succeeding in visiting physical destruction on physical equipment. Wired Magazine called it the first digital weapon. It's widely considered that the US and Israel collaborated over a period of 5 years to develop this malware. In 2009, Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, recognizing how important AND vulnerable important computers and networks were (are), directed the creation of USCYBERCOM. It is the unified command for the cyberspace domain in the US and the world. In 2016, the organization described the 2016 espionage ops against the Democratic National Committee while in the midst of a national election “serious business . . . [that] may destroy democracy.” Administration officials at the time considered that cyber weapons were so potentially destructive that they should be unleashed only on the direct orders of the Commander in Chief, like nuclear weapons. I do not know if there is an equivalent “Cyber Football.” Article 51 of the UN Charter allows individual countries to defend themselves and to band together to defend each other. It also allows the same if an armed attack is anticipated and recognizes the right to use force in such a situation. It allows cyberattacks to be considered an armed attack. In 2019, Israel did just this, by conducing airstrikes on a building that they said had Hamas members inside that were planning to launch a cyberattack on Israel. In 2021 the topic was up for noticeable public discussion again. NATO heads of state and government met at NATO’s North Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels and issued a communiqué that ultimately equates cyberattacks with kinetic attacks and leaves the possibility of military action against hackers on the table. Still, what we generally see is that cyberattacks - or anticipated cyberattacks - by states are dealt with by preemptive and after-the-fact punishing cyberattacks. Tit for tat, as it were, and even before the tat. Cyberwar in Action What we have seen in practice in Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014 and in Ukraine in 2021 is the “softening up” cyberattack. The attack used to diminish and disable defensive and living systems before a kinetic attack, rather than a kinetic attack in response to a cyberattack. Many said that the 2014-2015 cyberattacks were on a an entirely different – and grander – level than had been seen previously. Several Ukrainian banks and government agencies became inaccessible and malware – using a tool called “HermeticWiper” - was wiping data from hundreds of PCs and servers. But we’ve gotten used to common DDOS attacks, data-wiping and ransomware in recent years on the civilian level. It’s kind of taken for granted that these things are ongoing and all over. The use of cyberwar and kinetic war together has been labeled “hybrid warfare.” And yet, the world seems surprised that Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine in 2021 and 2022have been substantially less severe than anticipated. To be sure, they were and are ongoingly widespread. Hackers caused the Viasat satellites to become inoperative. But that may have affected Russian soldiers and commanders to lose connectivity as well. And said attack has been mitigated somewhat by the Musk’s activation of Starlink Internet satellites over Ukraine. Additionally, Ukrainian modems were zombie-fied by Russian malware, being used as nodes for targeted DDOD attacks within Ukraine. But the ruination from malware that was expected has not really seemed to occur. We haven't seen a cyber-Armageddon. Were they more pr? Were the US and/or the EU pumping up Ukraine’s cyber defenses or attacking the offensive cyber capabilities of Russia? The newspapers wonder about this and government sources overtly express surprise and confusion that there isn’t more cyber damage. I would be willing to wager that they know more about this than they are letting on. But then, isn’t that almost always the case? The coming days and weeks will tell us more about cyberwar in Ukraine. It’s possible that all-out disruption of Ukraine’s Internet will come to pass. We hope not. But one thing about this history stands out. We have not seen the kinetic response to cyberattacks on a wide scale that was being discussed a decade ago. Luck? Cooler heads? Invisible cyber counterattacks? Thoughts of a Cyber version the Mutually Assured Destruction doctrine that has, in theory, kept the world from launching nuclear war? Or is physical destruction on a massive scale enough to satisfy those bent on domination? These times we’re living in will surely shape the times we will be living in. Let us hope and work for that cyberwar doesn’t exceed the malign effects we have seen to date and that going forward we see fewer dire images because of fewer dire circumstances"
6,We Have Met the Enemy and He Is Us,politics," Cartoonist Walt Kelly modified and changed Commodore Perry’s famous quote to, “We have met the enemy and he is us” in a cartoon he created in 1970 celebrating the first Earth Day in 1970. The message being that man from his treatment of the earth is the planet’s enemy. It may also be true that the greatest enemy of democracy is not our corrupt leaders, but that a large part of our country’s citizens do not love or understand what democracy really means. If they do not love or want a free press that allows opposition and differences of opinion to flourish, then they do not love or want democracy. If legislators take away the rights of any minority and hamper free elections and the ability for every eligible citizen to easily cast a vote, then they do not love democracy. If school boards take books out of libraries as Texas is doing, because they consider the books too disturbing or controversial, then they are going down the path of the book burnings that happened in Nazi Germany and they do not love or want democracy.  Instead of democracy they want only their own opinions and their own laws to prevail and flourish and are willing to vote for leaders who will give them what they want. But leaders who willingly lie and bend the laws to obtain power eventually take away not only the rights of the minorities they oppose, but also ultimately take away all their citizens rights as we have seen in other countries that have become authoritarian and have lost their democracy. In the United States we are  on a dangerous road toward losing our freedom. If in the next few elections the people vote for leaders with selfish and corrupt motives and authoritarian tendencies, then the voters will ultimately be responsible for giving away their precious freedom and once you give away your freedom, it is very difficult and perhaps impossible to ever get it back. In a Democracy everyone has a voice and is worthy of respect. Poor people, rich people, minorities and majorities and people of different religions and different ethnicities. If a voter does not believe in that, then they do not love democracy. That is the dilemma that the voters in America will soon be facing in the coming elections in 2022 and 2024. How many voters still love democracy and are willing to vote for and support leaders who will protect it? The future of our country and the future and well-being of our children and all future generations are now in the hands of all of us who are voters—an awesome and frightening responsibility. We must now all work and fight to protect our ability to vote. We must fight for the ""For the People act of 2021"" that will help to protect every citizen’s right to vote. We must all make an effort to get the information we need from many different reliable sources so we can become wise and informed voters and ultimately cast our vote for leaders who will always protect our democracy and the rule of law and keep it forever strong and safe. Democracy needs every voter now as it has never before needed all of us to work and fight for its very survival."
7,A Society in Transition,politics," We all are aware that change in our personal lives is difficult, constant, and inevitable. We notice it when we look in the mirror or see our children grow. What is not so noticeable, however, but is also constant is the change that happens in our country and our world. That change happens so gradually that we don’t always notice it until those changes have made the world that we always knew unrecognizable. I was born before television and computers were in every household and our world then was different and slower-paced. That world, however, is gone now. We can’t get it back and we probably would not want it back. How would we live without our televisions and our computers? There is a segment of our society today that is nostalgic about the past and wants to return to the “good old days”,  but much of the “good old days” was not so admirable. When I was a child we simply accepted discrimination against minorities as normal. We accepted the career limits of women and the limitations on the role of minorities in society as normal. More of our young people today are going to college because of the availability of student loans and they expect their country to give equal opportunity and equality to all of its citizens without exceptions. This more inclusive attitude of a large part of our society is now a threat to those who have held power for a very long time and have denied equal rights to so many people for their own personal gain. When a part of our society denies that climate change is happening, it is because they don’t want to give up the oil and other benefits which make them rich. They are only aware of their self-interest and really don't care that they are damaging the environment or our country.  If they do not want equality for minorities, it is because it serves their self-interest to keep wages and benefits low. These people, who put self-interest before the interests of society, cannot hold back progress indefinitely. They are on the wrong side of history. People in every age have been striving to make their lives better and although it often takes a long time to change prevailing thought and achieve their goals, they inevitably do win. Black people after a very long time of being exploited were eventually freed from slavery. Women, after a long and dangerous struggle, eventually won the right to vote. More and more people are signing on to do the right thing rather than the expedient thing. We must all be prepared to go into the future and embrace the inevitable changes ahead which will ultimately change and also enrich our lives.. Our cities will eventually look different and be more diverse and we will all need to become more tolerant of different religions and ideas and different ways of thinking and living. Tolerance and acceptance for the benefit of all–that is the ultimate goal and the ultimate meaning of democracy and freedom."
8,The Assault on Science,politics," When I was a young girl, there was a great respect for people of science (doctors, scientists etc.). We trusted them and felt that the contributions of all of our world scientists had made our lives healthier and better. Therefore I was very surprised and disappointed when in 2021 after 50 years of warnings from 97% of our most prestigious scientists that we are still living in a dangerous time of climate change our legislators have as yet not taken the actions they need to take to protect us from this life-threatening calamity. The Worlds most Prestigious Scientific Organizations believe that the Climate is Warming The following is a partial list of scientific organizations along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources. Statement on Climate Change from 18 Scientific Associations “Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.” (2009) Climate deniers are often funded by corporations, companies and individuals who for their own economic interests do not want environmental protection laws that will limit their profits. American Association for the Advancement of Science “The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society.” (2006) American Chemical Society “Comprehensive scientific assessments of our current and potential future climates clearly indicate that climate change is real, largely attributable to emissions from human activities, and potentially a very serious problem.” (2004) American Geophysical Union “Human‐induced climate change requires urgent action. Humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years. Rapid societal responses can significantly lessen negative outcomes.” (Adopted 2003, revised and reaffirmed 2007, 2012, 2013) American Medical Association “Our AMA … supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant.” (2013) American Meteorological Society “It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide.” (2012) American Physical Society “The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth’s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.” (2007) The Geological Society of America “The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s.” (2006; revised 2010) There is only a small window of time left for us to act on this life-threatening problem for our planet before we will no longer be able to protect ourselves from this dangerous calamity. International Academies: Joint Statement “Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001).” (2005, 11 international science academies) National Academy of Sciences “The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.” (2005) U.S. Global Change Research Program “The global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases. Human ‘fingerprints’ also have been identified in many other aspects of the climate system, including changes in ocean heat content, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and Arctic sea ice.” (2009, 13 U.S. government departments and agencies) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed. The amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.” “Human influence on the climate system is clear and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.” List of Worldwide Scientific Organizations This page lists the nearly 200 worldwide scientific organizations that hold the position that climate change has been caused by human action. Source information: NASA –Global climate change Climate Deniers “Unfortunately there is also a long list of climate deniers who have made a living out of denying the science of climate change. These so-called ‘experts’ often start out their statements with ‘I’m not a climate scientist, but…’ before launching into a series of carefully rehearsed talking points meant to confuse the public on the climate change issue. A great many of them are well-paid operatives of organizations like The Heartland Institute, CFACT, and Americans for Prosperity, which take contributions from fossil fuel corporations — including ExxonMobil, the Koch Brothers and their company Koch Industries — who seek to delay or block any substantial government policy initiatives meant to curb fossil fuel emissions or hasten the rapid growth of cheaper, cleaner sources of energy like wind and solar.” – Source information: Before the flood In  2019, 1.1 million students skipped school for a climate strike protest. These are young people and young voters who care about their future and  took action to show our politicians that they are concerned about what is happening to our environment and to their future. They are also aware that the Republicans in Congress because of their own self-interest and economic greed have been fighting to prevent any constructive action on addressing climate change and making our country and world safer. In 2021 and 2022  we all will have the opportunity to make our voices heard again on this important life and death issue. If we make the wrong choice at the ballot box, this country and this earth that we love so much, and our children and all future generations will ultimately pay the price of living on a more dangerous and life-threatening planet. Now is the time that we must all commit ourselves to protect this fragile earth from that unthinkable fate."
9,The Evolution and Effects of Quebec Independence Movement,politics," The independence movement in Quebec is not really a recent phenomenon, in fact, nationalistic feelings in French Canadians in forming a nation of their own has its root in pre-industrial Quebec or New France, when the inhabitants there adhered on becoming ‘Canadienne’ – a single, unique group of people living separately with their own identity from mother country France. The fall of New France to the British in 1759 only amplified nationalistic feelings inside the inhabitants of New France who were being dominated politically, economically, and culturally by the British. Indeed, the modern history of the independence movement in Quebec began in the 1960s when “the people of the province began to question the assumptions on which their apparent placid, unchanging society was founded.”  The movement slowly gained prominence in the following three decades until the sovereignty referendum of 1980. The eventual rise of the movement between the 1960s through the 1980s could be traced back through events in the following chronological order: the demise of Duplessis government and emergence of a liberal government under Jean Lesage ushering in the renewal of Quebec’s economic and social institutions, the emergence of Quiet Revolution in the early 1960s, the language movement, the surfacing of Parti Quebecoise as a political force in Quebec and finally the referendum on Quebec sovereignty in 1980. The movement and the referendum that followed have made us Canadians question the very basis of our Canadian society; it shook the foundation of the Canadian state with the very existence of the country being in question. Amongst the most profound effects of the independence movement of Quebec is the redefining of Canada as a federal state sponsoring the notion of being a truly bilingual yet a multicultural society and the transformation of French Canadian nationalism into Quebec nationalism. The death of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis in September 1959 marked the end of Grande noirceur – the dark age that had absorbed Quebec. “Down to 1959 or 1960 Quebec was governed through a deeply conservative political system that produced regular majorities for a premier, Maurice Duplessis, who proclaimed the superiority and the desirability of doing things the old way, preserving the old values of Quebec’s Catholic society.“   He ruled Quebec like a quasi-dictator in promoting and preserving the status-quo in Quebec. “No less than other societies Quebec was challenged by urbanization, industrialization, secularism and other facets of modernization. But to a greater degree than other societies, Quebec resisted thrust of modernization, fearing that accommodation with them would have grave social consequences, undermining its values and threatening the survival of its people.”  The premier who succeeded Duplessis was Jean Lesage, who was a liberal and a top minister under Louis St-Laurent. Lasage is credited with moving Quebec forward after the ‘dark era.’ Under Lesage’s leadership, the Liberals had ended the sixteen-year rule of the Union National Party in Quebec promising sweeping reforms in government institutions such as education, healthcare, and social welfare etc. In fact, education, healthcare, and social welfare were controlled by the Catholic clergy largely prior to the revolution. The working class, as it became increasingly urban dwellers, felt that these public institutions under the Church were unable to react to and meet their needs.  With the on slot of higher fertility rate in the general population after the Second World War and baby-boomers increasingly coming into the workforce, the Catholic Church was in lack of the resources and personnel in properly conducting these social intuitions with the altered demographic conditions. So they were forced to employ more laymen. Moreover, the change of values espoused by Quebecers which were increasingly liberal and secular, together with the decrease of religiosity in the mindset of ordinary people in Quebec resulted in reducing the role and authority of the Church in society. The reforms undertaken by the state resulted in liberalizing and transforming Quebec society and ultimately ushered in the Quiet Revolution.  According to William D. Coleman: “The independence movement was not the instigator of the Quiet Revolution or even part of that revolution, Rather it was a consequence, a product of the series of changes that began to be realized in Quebec late in the 1950s.“  The Quiet Revolution, heralded as the root of the independence movement, according to Herbert Guindon, lay in the modernization of Quebec which began with the large-scale involvement of the provincial government in Quebec society, in the early 1960s.  But this does not tell the whole story, the Quiet Revolution was not just a change in government policy, instead, it was a change in spirit or atmosphere and a change in attitude in traditional Quebec society.  “In ten years there was a radical change that affected ways of thinking, ideologies, culture… It was like a pot whose lid was kept in place by the Duplessis system; when someone dared to open it, it exploded.” Through the Quiet Revolution, French Canada had united in a new re-invigorated form and the future of the nation seemed to be of enormous promise. It was short-lived though and when it disappeared some felt loss of self-worth and their disappointment fuelled the independence movement.  The effect of the revolution became visible as the independent movement formed with the creation of the Mouvement Souverainte-Association (MSA), the predecessor of Parti Quebecoise in 1967.  “In 1967, Quebec was catapulted onto the international scene by the Montreal World’s Fair (Expo’67) that drew hordes of visitor…and was a major milestone in rising Quebec nationalism…Sovereignists were ignited by [French President] General de Gaulles’ shout from the balcony of Montreal City Hall: ‘Vive le Quebec…libre!’ That Fall, the Parti Quebecoise coalesced under Rene Levesque.” The commencement of the independence movement can be traced back to the labor dispute in Radio-Canada in 1959. The producers in the institution tried to start a labour union with the management strongly opposing such a move. The producers went on strike which lasted two months. In the end, the people blamed the Canadian Parliament and the Confederation itself for the wrong-doing, not the management of Radio-Canada or the Minister responsible. This highly symbolic event signifies the external political and economic pressure that is inflicted upon the development of Quebec society.  Some fifteen years later, the Radio-Canada incident resulted in the election of Parti Quebecoise. The Radio-Canada incident influenced the people’s opinion in Quebec, made them feel alienated, and made them question the degree of participation of francophones in federal institutions. Georges-Emile Lapalme, who was the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party from 1950 to 1958, is considered one of the fathers of the Quiet Revolution. In 1958 he wrote a manifesto in which he specified all the reforms necessary for the development of Quebec, which became the basis for the Quiet Revolution. He expressed a new role for the Quebec state which would lead the way for Quebec’s economic emancipation. To fight Duplessis’s policies, he put forward a notion of progressive nationalism. His ideas were taken up by Lesage in his election campaign. Through Lapalme’s ideas, Quebec nationalism became linked with social reform, a step forward from Duplessis’s nationalism that was based on conservative ideology. This new form of nationalism had its downturn as well as “this independence movement among French-speaking Quebecois is producing a new form of nationalism, one that often embodies a hostile and isolationist approach in pursuit of political, social and economic recognition. This new nationalism, along with multiculturalism, is affecting Canada's national identity as more people are unsure about their roots. These unexpected changes that have taken place in Canada have raised many questions about the country's future.”  Lapalm intended to have the Quebec state play a much important role in the economic development of Quebec instead of waiting for Ottawa to take the initiative, but this had a negative consequence as this neo-nationalism made Quebec going in the direction of isolationism – Quebec government doing what is necessary for its socio-political and economic development paying no heed to Ottawa and the rest of Canada, for example, the inaction of the Bill 101 which exemplifies the whole question of the Language Movement in Quebec to which we turn next. The Language Question in Quebec emerged as the next wave of political force behind the independence movement in Quebec.  The French Canadians were the majority in the province of Quebec with their French language, but in the Canadian federation, they were the minority. The language question – the status of French in Canada was exemplified first by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. “It examined income, occupation, and ethnicity, and revealed that in Quebec, the province where they were a majority, French Canadians were firmly at the bottom of the income and occupation heap. In federal institutions, French Canadians were simply not proportionately represented, and when they were, it was in low-status and low-paying jobs.”  So the Quebec government enacted legislation to protect their language and culture and in the years that followed, Quebec increasingly demanded for control of its cultural institutions. Looking back at Jean Lesag’s slogan: ‘maitres chez nous’ (‘masters in our own home’), of Daniel Johnson’s ‘L’egalite ou l’independance’ (equality or independence) or the enactment of Bill 101, Bill 178 and the language police”- all these events point to the fact that Quebec’s survival as a nation are directly linked to French language regulations. In 1974 the government under Robert Bourassa, a federalist Liberal, proposed to enact Bill 22, la loi sur la langue officielle that replaced a 1969 bill. Bill 22 established French as the language of workplace and government institutions. It also limited English education to only those Anglophone students who had prior education in the English medium.   They had to take an entry test to attend English schools. Bourassa was unable to win the battle he had started; only Rene Levesque was trusted enough by the Quebecers to settle the language issue, as history demonstrated.  “ Parti Quebecoise had become the only political force radical enough to make drastic changes without  concessions to the English minority and credible enough to be trusted by a population who believed the traditional parties to be linked to the still-powerful English minority.”  Rene Levesque acknowledged that it was deplorable that a nation had to legislate to validate the use of its own language in work and business, but he believed it had to be done, as a matter of survival for French Canadians who had been an enslaved race for so long. The emergence of Parti Quebecoise (PQ) was the next major event that flourished the independence movement in Quebec. “Quebec was burning and by the end of turbulent 1960s, separatism had quickly gone from being a fringe ideology to become a feasible option.”  It was a tumultuous time as a militant terrorist organization named The Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) emerged prior to the emergence of the PQ and bombed federal mailboxes, assassinated labour and manpower minister Pierre Laporte and kidnapped British diplomat James Cross. Events in the next two decades would rock the whole of Canada to its core. Bill 101, a brainchild of PQ government was “a deliberate attempt by Parti Quebecoise to create a symbol, to show the people of ‘the country of Quebec’ that the clock had been turned back, the battle of the Plains of Abraham had been won, after all, their struggle for survival was over, and that a new life – the one the fathers and mothers of New France would have wanted - was starting.” The Parti Quebecoise defeated the Liberal government of Bourassa and came to power in 1976 which marked the renewal of the Quiet Revolution and its completion.  It was a historic moment for the people of Quebec because the Quiet Revolution was brought to the front again with its nationalist dimension. But it was not a triumph for the sovereignists yet, as in 1976 the PQ did not run on the issue of separatism rather its campaign was on the issue of good governance.  The Liberal Bourassa’s campaign was plagued by accusations of widespread corruption during its rule. PQ promised to bring the issue of independence only after a Quebec-wide referendum within five years of winning the election. In the 1980 referendum, Quebecers were asked to decide on whether to allow the government to negotiate sovereignty-association with Ottawa. “ This agreement would enable Quebec to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and establish relations abroad – in other words, sovereignty – and at the same time, to maintain with Canada an economic association including a common currency.”  Finally, the province-wide referendum took place on May 20, 1980, and the proposal to pursue secession was defeated by a 59.56 percent to 40.44 percent margin. The yes side primarily lost because of the lack of support from the Quebec businessmen. Prior to the referendum, Levesque tried to woo the business community by reassuring that sovereignty would ultimately benefit everybody including businessmen, but the business community was not moved by the assurances.  Maurice Seguin, a controversial and renowned Quebec historian doubts whether Quebec’s independence is even possible – “So on the one hand, he saw the tragedy of this conquered nation, in a minority position, for which independence was a desirable end. But on the other hand, he said: ‘It is so well kept, maybe the best-kept nation in the world, and these golden chains make its liberation difficult to achieve.”  Since Quebec was so well kept by others in current federal Canada, he doubted whether Quebec could ever achieve independence. The effects that the independence movement on Quebec and Canada between the 1960s and 1980s are: the redefining of Canada as a federal nation espousing a truly multicultural society- it is bilingual in orientation but multiethnic in composition. Another effect would be the evolution of nationalism in Quebec from French Canadian nationalism to Quebecoise nationalism. First, Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau was a powerful force on the ‘no’ side of the referendum. To contain the rising tide of Quebec nationalism, he implemented a number of strategies like promoting bilingualism with the Official Language Act of 1969, increasing francophone representation in federal government services, and increasing French language services of Radio-Canada throughout Canada.   He termed ’Quebec Nationalism’ as being ‘dead’ and proposed a renewed and revitalized form of federalism in Canada. He also proposed more economic presence of the federal government’s in the province of Quebec only if the yes side was defeated.   “Trudeau’s concept of Canada, while completely rejecting what he called Quebec nationalism, had this important aspect to it that is minority language rights across the country.“   Promoting bilingual services with minority French language established as one of Canada’s both official languages. The second effect of the independence movement was the emergence of Quebec nationalism in place of the French Canadian nationalism – to have a clearer and precise identity – a Quebec identity. This new identity defined being a Quebecoise in territorial terms; it included people living in Quebec including non-francophone people who live here. Quebec has to become more multi-ethnic to keep pace with the globalized world with increased migration. “The idea of Quebec is not and cannot be an ethnic idea; it has to be a cultural idea, encompassing people of diverse origins.” In conclusion, the rise of the independence movement is characterized by events such as the fall of the Duplessis regime and emergence of a liberal government under Jean Lesage, renewal of Quebec’s economic and social institutions, the emergence of the Quiet Revolution in the early 1960s, the language movement, the emergence of Parti Quebecoise as a political force in Quebec and finally the sovereignty referendum in 1980. Some might think that the Quebec independence movement lasted only a few decades, they are quite mistaken in understanding the history of Quebec nationalism. The roots of the movement went back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It may have increased in certain eras and abated in other times, but it came back again and again. The only constant in the history of Quebec is the rise in self-assertion and questioning its link with Canada and finding its place in the federal system.  It may become a time when the Quebecers will completely assimilate themselves in Canada so that there would be no necessity for Quebec nationalism. Quebec nationalism may not be eternal but as long as there are people in Canada who speak French it will always come back to remind us of the struggle that has happened in Quebec through its independence movement.  The contending fact is that without the rest of Canada acting as an increasingly bilingual buffer promoting bilingualism and biculturalism, Quebec would become more and more isolated from the North American mainstream.

10,"Covid Conspiracies and the Animal Rights community in Victoria, Australia",politics," Let us think rationally if that is possible. Why would any government, left, right, or in the middle, proceed with the up-popular choice of a lockdown if they did not believe it was the only choice available at the time? Seriously think about that. I grew up with politics being something that one should always take notice of. As a child, there was always political talk happening around the house. My parents were both politically engaged and encouraged their children to be the same. Mum didn't just watch a little April cry, absolutely devastated at the sight of the Dolphin slaughter in Japan, instead Mum offered actions I could take for positive change (an animal rights activist was born). I was not taught to blindly accept what our governments or other authorities put forward, but rather to question and fight for change if I felt it was needed. I have lived my life like that and have taught my children the same. For those in the movement of animal rights who are on the side of covid deniers, anti-vaxxers or so-called freedom fighters; do you realise what calling for the sacking of Dan Andrews would mean? Who do you propose an alternative - Michael O'Brien? The re-hashed Matthew Guy? Seriously, anyone from the right side of politics? As an example of where the loyalties of the Liberal/coalition lie, the previous Agriculture Minister in the Dennis Napthine Coalition Government, Peter Walsh, (who still sits in parliament), told me he felt sorry for me not having dairy in my diet, and no, he would not change the legal stance of baby calves allowed to go 30 hours without food and water before these babies are slaughtered. No, this also has not changed under our current state government of the Labor party, but a whole lot has in the positive direction for animals. I seriously encourage you to look through the voting history of the right and see that animals have ZERO HOPE under a Liberal/coalition government. The Liberal/coalition's stance on anything is making a dollar, especially off someone they can exploit and enslave as easily as animals. Yes, I am firmly rusted on the left side of politics. I come from a working-class family and stand with workers and the unions that support them. I also stand with anyone, no matter their species, who is disadvantaged or discriminated against. I was not always like this, although, always left. I didn't see my learned racism. I didn't see my learnt sexism. My family are not horrible people, but there is subtle and not so subtle racism and sexism. I met a beautiful man when I was 19, and he was patient with me. No, he was/is not perfect – like all of us – far from it, but he has always been one to fight against most 'isms', particularly racism (like me, he is learning to un-learn our subtle sexism). At the risk of sounding like a complete tosser, we are all on a journey of learning. We all want someone to blame or rail against, but sometimes there is no one to blame. Humans are not immune to disease. It is arrogant to suggest this. Coming up with a conspiracy theory and claiming that Covid 19 is not real suggests that arrogance. We are susceptible to disease, and we have had pandemics reign upon our species before. We are a smart species in some ways (yet so so stupid in others – think climate change). We are smart enough to keep beating Mother Nature as she tries to curb our species on this planet – and quite rightly so when you look at the damage our species causes. We can fight disease with the invention of many medicines. I'm sure even the anti-vaxxers have all had a dose or two of penicillin in their lives. We also have vaccines that have almost irradicated certain diseases that attack our species – like measles and polio. I believe in science. Science and the scientists that study and research our planet and all who inhabit it are incredible. That is why I trust the science that these scientists have come up with to battle this pandemic, and I urge all to do the same so we can all move forward and overcome this Covid 19 virus. I also urge all to adopt a vegan diet to prevent more zoonotic diseases from attacking our species. This change also makes a massive positive contribution to stopping climate change, and the best thing about living vegan - you are no longer a contributor to animal suffering."
11,Democracy in the Crosshairs,politics," I have been a witness to the democratic process for many, many years. I have participated in numerous elections that have brought to office Democrats and Republicans of various philosophies and styles, but I have never before been worried through all of these various changes that our democracy was in danger of not surviving. A democracy is based on the rule of law and when there is an assault on our laws, that is an assault on our democracy. Because I am so concerned, I have been paying more attention to the political changes that are occurring not only in our country but also in the world. I have begun to realize that what is happening in our country is not an isolated event, but is also happening all over Europe. Right wing parties and leaders are running on the same hate agenda as our former president and the current Republican party and getting elected. That agenda is immigration issues and stoking long simmering hatreds and using these issues to gain power and install systematic corruption. The rise of right-wing nationalism in Europe is widespread, and it is making gains in the following countries: Italy–17.4% Germany– 12.6% Spain–10% Austria–26% France –13% Sweden—17.6% Estonia—17.8% Hungary–49%–19% Anti-immigrant laws are being passed in-- Denmark–21% The Netherlands–13% The Czech Republic–11% Right-wing nationalists across Europe and also here in America are now sensing an opportunity. The immigration issue is the catalyst that is causing this world fear and intolerance and is a world problem which must be confronted and solved by all freedom loving people in all the countries of Europe and America working together. Because of climate change, natural disasters, wars, gangs and dictatorships around the world, and the ending of the war in Afghanistan, large numbers of refugees are fleeing their countries to try to survive. This will only continue to increase if the world does not become more stable. What will happen to these millions of refugees? Will the world close their eyes to the fate of all of these vulnerable people and this overwhelming human crisis and pretend it is not happening or should the compassionate countries of the world get together to solve this enormous problem by taking action? World leaders working together must now begin to stabilize those countries at risk and address the problems that are causing this flight of refugees. Leaders need to decide on a fair number of refugees that each country can absorb. if they don’t begin to address these unsolved problems, their inaction will ultimately destabilize the whole world. We need to be very concerned about what is happening. If we are not aware of this assault on world democracy, then we are all in danger of eventually losing our freedom both in America and elsewhere in the world. When hate becomes the norm, not only refugees and minorities are at risk, but it endangers the freedom of all of us. We must become more aware of this imminent danger to democracy and do all that we can to ensure that this catastrophe will never happen here."
12,The Continuing Fight for Equality,politics," “We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal. That they are endowed, by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""-- Thomas Jefferson 1801-1809 The congress will be voting soon on the voting rights Bill HR1—the For the People Act. Why are we still fighting for equality and the right to free access to voting for all of our citizens in 2021.The Republicans in state legislatures in many states are passing bills to limit access to voting. They have already passed over 200 bills to do that. In a democracy that is unacceptable and limits all of our rights and ultimately will destroy our democracy. We, the people, cannot allow them to do this. That is why voting rights bill HR1 must pass and be a protection for us all. The United States and the world have been fighting discrimination for as long as people have walked on this earth. It has been the Catholics against the Protestants, discrimination against the Jews, Jews in conflict with Palestinians, crimes against Chinese workers and other Asians, The Crusades--Christians against the Muslims. Arab tribes against each other. intolerance between whites and blacks. The truth is that people do not like or trust others who are different than they are. It takes understanding and wisdom to learn to get along even in loving families. We have come to a point in our world that we must learn to live together in peace and harmony or we will all ultimately die together because unless we learn to come together and solve our difficult problems together this civilization will ultimately disintegrate through nuclear destruction or unaddressed natural disasters like climate change. Most of our religions have all tried to teach us to love and respect each other, but unfortunately some have also caused us to distrust anyone who is different.. Our moral and ethical leaders have worked hard to bring us closer to becoming more tolerant of differences. We cannot and should not force other people, whether it is our families or our fellow citizens, to think and feel as we do, but we must learn to respect the opinions and the choices of others as long as they also respect our opinions and our choices. We must all learn to make the effort to live together with respect and in peace. I don't know what the religions or political opinions or races of my neighbors on my street are, but we have all lived side by side for many years—each living the life that suits them and we are a good community. Each of us must now look into our own hearts and root out the distrust that we might feel for those who are different from us and begin to live with more respect and tolerance for every human being in the US and in the world. We must reject words and deeds of intolerance and hate whether they come from our families, our religions, our communities, our TV's or our social media. Respect and tolerance for all human beings is the only option that will ultimately save our democracy and our planet."
13,A Question of Survival,politics," Recently I was watching the movie Conquest of Paradise with Gerard Depardieu, a movie about Columbus and his discovery of the new world. As I was watching the cruelty that occurred in those days (1492)– the Spanish Inquisition and the brutality of what was done to the native populations when soldiers from a foreign country came in and killed them at will and took everything they possessed, I realized that although more than 500 years have passed and our world has changed in so many ways, we are still killing each other at the same pace and for the same reasons as we did so many hundreds of years ago. Why, when the world has become so modern with the invention of cars, planes, new medical techniques our enhanced communication through the internet and so much new knowledge about psychology and the better understanding of the subconscious motivations and drives of human beings, why then are we still functioning in this primitive, brutal way. With vast numbers of smart, educated people able to achieve so many modern inventions and innovations to make our lives safer and better and our astronauts exploring the vastness of outer space, why is it that these same smart, educated people still cannot figure out how we can learn to get along with each other better both in our families or in our world. I think perhaps the answer is that no one is really willing to make the effort and spend the required money to try to solve these most important and crucial world issues on which our very survival is ultimately dependent. Our scientists have already warned us that we have now come to the tipping point in our civilization. We will either begin to collectively work with our world partners to face the real problems of our world or we will all continue to go on as we have with blinders on and go to our destruction together in the not too distant future. Why are we not facing our world problems with wisdom and determination to find solutions? I think that our leaders and our citizens are just so ill-equipped and frightened to look at the reality and the challenges of the future that we all just want pretend that everything is fine and there are no problems. It is called denial! To solve climate change will mean changing our society in many new ways. It will mean changing from fossil fuels to renewable energy, with the loss of old ways and old jobs and the beginning of new technologies and new jobs. “Humanity will have given up on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems.” Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, has implored governments to ensure 2021 is not just another “year of conferences” on the ongoing ecological destruction of the planet, urging countries to take definitive action on deforestation, pollution and the climate crisis. “Humanity will have given up on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems,” the United Nation’s new biodiversity chief has warned. Change is always hard and is resisted by many, but when survival is at stake we don’t have any more options. It must be done and as Elizazbeth Maruma Mrema warns it must be done now–this year– 2021. Another challenge that is destabilizing the world is the intermingling of people of different backgrounds, religions and race. Many populations are being displaced because of internal conflicts, climate change and natural disasters. All religions teach us to be tolerant and respect our fellow man. It is time that we followed our oldest values of love and respect. It is often difficult to tolerate others who look and think differently than we do, but if we respect each other and strive to learn to understand each other better and to live together in peace, than although our world will look different and be different than it is now, it will be one of stability and harmony. If every citizen and every leader dedicates himself to working toward these goals now, addressing climate change and dealing wisely and humanely with displaced populations than perhaps we can still avoid the imminent disaster that is awaiting our world in our lifetime."

0,A Question for Moderate Republicans,politics," I have been voting for a very long time. Sometimes democrats won and sometimes republicans won. The issues that we voted on then were simple. Republicans voted for fiscal responsibility and lower taxes and democrats voted to improve social conditions for their own families and for the families of all Americans at risk.  Both parties were sincere in their opinions about what was best for the country. America’s strength was about working on compromises to find the best solution that both parties could agree on. Recently the Republican Party has changed. It is now about gaining power and putting into effect their own values and their own opinions on all issues by any means that they can, even when a majority of the voters may not agree with them. Many long-time republicans and also recent moderate republicans are becoming concerned about the direction their party is taking.  Moderate republicans love our democracy just as democrats and independents do, and don’t want to lose the rights we have all fought so hard to win for all of our citizens. They don't really want to vote for the authoritarian leaders their party is backing. They don’t like the campaign of hate and disinformation that their party is using to win at any cost. The question now for more moderate republicans in our country is what will they do with their vote in the coming elections? Moderate republicans are now faced with a difficult decision. If they don’t feel that they can vote either republican or democratic then their only option would be not to vote at all in the next few elections until their party again becomes the strong and valued party that they have always loved and remembered from the past. Will moderate Republicans choose to do the right thing that they feel will save our democracy or will they do the expedient thing and vote with a party that they know is on a wrong and dangerous path? That is the challenging question that many moderate republicans are asking themselves now? The answer to that difficult question has yet to be determined."
1,Fake News,politics," Fake News We hear a great deal these days about misinformation, disinformation, and fake news.  It is leading some people to question the first amendment guarantee on freedom of expression.  This is understandable; after all, it’s only a small step from hate crimes to hate speech.  The above mentioned terms are difficult to define, however, I can think of some concrete historical examples which may give us some insight into understanding the larger concepts.  Let’s start with Ukraine in the 1930’s. Upton Sinclair, a famous progressive writer in the early part of the 20th Century, visited Russia in the 1920’s.  Upon his return to the United States, he stated, “I have seen the future, and it works.”  Sinclair may have been honestly duped, but Walter Duranty knew better.  Duranty was a writer for the famed New York Times who was sent to Russia in 1922 and stayed until 1936.  What we knew about what was happening in Russia during those years, we got from Duranty.  First, let’s take a look at a few facts.  There was a massive famine in the early 1930’s, mainly in Ukraine but also in Russia itself.  There is general agreement that the horrors were brought on by the policies of communist dictator Joseph Stalin.  Three to four million died of starvation in Ukraine and two to three million in Russia.  It was so bad in Ukraine that cannibalism was a common occurrence.  According to the reporting of Duranty, everything was fine.  He absolutely denied there was any problem whatsoever.  His articles, more or less, maintained that there is nothing to see here.  To make matter worse, he heaped scorn on another reporter who had directly witnessed what was taking place.  To add insult to injury, Duranty received a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 during the height of the famine. Herbert Matthews, another Times reporter, did a Duranty imitation of his own in 1957 when he interviewed guerilla leader Fidel Castro of Cuba.  In his article Matthews portrayed Castro in the best possible light.  He said Castro had a massive army, the majority of the people were on his side, and he was not a communist.  He went so far as to say that Castro was actually an anti-Communist.  After Castro took over Cuba in 1959, Matthews continued to proclaim the noncommunist nature of the new government.  He was still holding to this position into 1960 when Castro himself put an end to the nonsense by coming out of the closet and declaring himself a proud communist. Many people alive today remember the energy crisis of the 1970’s.  It was a time of gas shortages, long lines at the pump, and surging prices.  To conserve energy President Nixon instituted day light savings time the year around (it only lasted one year) and set the speed limit at 55.  President Carter told Americans to shiver in the winter and sweat profusely in the summer.  Looking back, it seems fairly obvious that the problem was instability in the Middle East and government control over the price of oil.  However, we were told by the government, the media, and academia that the world was running out of oil.  I personally bought in to this line of reasoning; it seemed entirely logical.  Demand for oil across the board was through the roof, and there is a limited amount of fossil fuel.  I remember a conversation I had with a friend during the 70’s in which I stated that oil was running out.  She said, “There’s plenty of oil!”  I thought she sounded ignorant, but I was the one who was uninformed.  It’s been almost 50 since that conversation, and we still have plenty of oil.  Regardless of how one feels about climate change and other related issues regarding fossil fuels, we were not running out of oil in the 1970’s. George W. Bush, for whatever reason, was determined to get rid of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  At first the government through Vice President Dick Cheney tried to tie Hussein to Al Qaeda.  That didn’t work; there was simply no evidence.  Then, they fell back on weapons of mass destruction.  Bush and the CIA claimed that Iraq had chemical weapons and was pursuing a nuclear capability.  The intellectual community was convinced, and the rest is history.  There was no investigative reporting on the part of the media as they bought the argument hook, line, and sinker.  Of course, it was all a lie.  The only thing relating to weapons of mass destruction the U. S. Army found when it invaded Iraq was a mobile lab which contained a few high school type solutions and materials. There is and always has been an abundance of fake news.  It’s the public’s job to sort things out, and it usually can.  We most always say, “Hey that sounds silly.”  The problem comes in when the fake news is supported by the media and the government.  When that happens, it can have catastrophic consequences."
2,Politics at Trinity High School,politics," Politics at Trinity High School Those who know me realize I am a very conservative person politically.  When I attended a teacher In-Service after being hired by Trinity High School in 1985 at age 39, I realized I was entering a liberal environment.  A couple of my new colleagues were talking about how horrible the South African government was.  Shortly afterwards in teacher conferences, the principal (Sr. Stephanie Warren) subjected us to some women’s liberation theories.  Some revolved around spouse abuse and how it was caused by a patriarchal society.  Others concerned language and its sexist nature.  I talked to my dad about these developments, and he advised me to go about my job and keep my mouth shut.  Since I needed the job, I decided to take his advice. In looking back, Sr. Stephanie was in many ways ahead of her time.  In 1985, most of her beliefs were considered off the rails; now, they are the norm.  She was also very much an advocate of the nuclear freeze movement.  The year before, when she was just a teacher, she went to the Trinity Board and asked it to take a stand on this issue.  Tom Isbill, one of the Board members, told her to come back when the Soviet Union no longer posed a threat. Anthony Scola was the assistant principal at Trinity.  Anthony was what one might call an old hippie with an effeminate personality and a keen sense of humor.  He was also an intellectual type who could be very aggressive.  You didn’t want to disagree with Anthony; he could cut you down to size in no time flat.  He was a former priest who in his younger years had opposed the war in Vietnam.  Eventually he left the priesthood and the Catholic Church altogether.  He married a former nun (Margaret) who also left the church, and they both became Quakers.  The simple and pacifist lifestyle of the Brotherhood appealed to their sense of right and wrong. Margaret taught at St. Mary’s, one of the grade schools connected to Trinity.  She was also an old hippie who supposedly went so far as refusing to shave her legs or under her arms.  Originally the Scolas were from Milwaukee, but they wanted to get away from the fast paced urban life.  When they were hired to teach at Trinity and St. Mary’s in Whitesville, Kentucky; the town was too big for them so they settled in Deanefield, a smaller community to the southeast.  Whitesville contains about 600 people while Deanefield has less than 100. I discovered there was a divide between the administrators and clergy of Trinity on the one hand and the parents and students on the others.  In 1988 the Evansville Bosse basketball team, mostly Black, traveled to face a mostly White Heritage Hills team.  There had been a history of bad blood between the two schools.  On their journey, the Bosse team noticed burning crosses along the side of the highway.  Sr. Stephanie and some of her fellow sisters who taught at Trinity expressed horror over the situation.  Later I overheard some Trinity parents laughing and hee-hawing about the same incident. Sr. Stephanie left Trinity after four years as principal.  Despite my disagreement with her ideology, I had no problem with her as a person or a superior.  She gave me a job when I needed one, promoted me to athletic director after just one year, and always treated me with respect.  Several times she went to bat for me in disciplinary and personality clash situations.  Her replacement was Dan Fuller, a well traveled school administrator who came to Trinity from Florida.  At first glance he appeared to be more of the same.  In a document he submitted to the Board explaining his philosophy, he used feminine pronouns to refer to non-gender antecedents. Dan was a unique individual.  The students loved him and he commanded their respect.  They called him ‘Dan the Man.’  From an academic standpoint, he and W. A. Franklin (an Ohio County assistant principal) were the most scholarly and well read administrators with whom I have ever been associated.  However, he gave the students an inordinate amount of freedom, and after one year the teachers were a bit upset.  On her principal evaluation form, one teacher included the statement, “Less ‘Dan the Man’ and more Mr. Fuller.”  Some concerned teachers led by Anthony Scola and Sr. Lorraine Lauter (a religion instructor) tried to have Dan fired.  When the attempt failed, Anthony took a one year sabbatical at the University of Kentucky in order to work on a degree in Spanish. During Dan’s first year, Sr. Dianna Ortiz (a friend of Sr. Lorraine) claimed she was kidnapped, tortured, and raped by America’s allies in Guatemala.  Sr. Lorraine arranged for the school to have a special assembly to address the issue.  She turned the assembly into an America bashing session in which United States foreign policy was depicted as evil and sinister.  I sat in the back, and as the negativity toward the United States became intense, I shook my head in disbelief and disgust.  At one point I looked over at Dan who was sitting across from me, and he was cracking up with laughter at my response.  I interpreted this as meaning I had a friend and ally.  It turned out that I was correct because next year he promoted me to dean of students. Margaret Scola, Anthony’s wife, got involved in a running debate with a grade school colleague over the Gulf War of 1991.  She said we needed to give sanctions more time before going to war.  Jamie Clark, her colleague, challenged her by saying, “I can’t think of a worse way to die than starving.”  When Anthony returned from his sabbatical, Dan saddled him with the worst possible classes; they were chock full of troublemakers.  Anthony challenged the scheduling, but the Board upheld Dan.  A few years later, Anthony and Margaret resigned to become African missionaries.  They were stationed in Sudan, and I feared for their safety.  Nothing bad happened; however, as they both attended a Trinity graduation in the mid-90’s.  Also leaving were Sr. Lorraine and Sr. Theresa Henry (another liberation theology advocate).  With these departures, liberalism at Trinity pretty much ceased to exist. Shortly after his third year began, Dan himself resigned to take a principal’s position in Maine.  As chief disciplinarian I basically had the run of the school for the remainder of the year.  Another teacher (Katie Williams) was appointed interim principal, but she gave me the freedom to operate as I saw fit.  In 1992 John Calhoun was hired as principal.  He was a Ross Perot type of conservative, and we were off to the races. There was a bit of backsliding in 2000 when Mike Clark became principal.  Even though Mike was liberal, he did not make a point of advancing a political agenda.  However, one of his hires as a religion teacher did.  One day I noticed a document in my mailbox which was full of propaganda about how military spending was ruining America.  When I complained to the secretary about such items being placed in our personal spaces, she told me it was done by Bob Nicodemus, the religion instructor.  I then confronted Bob, and we became involved in a ferocious argument.  He defended the propaganda and his actions by comparing it to sending a Christmas card.  The argument went on and on, and we ended up yelling at each other.  Anyway, Bob left after one year, and Mike was gone as principal after two.  Afterwards, we returned to normal. It is appropriate in light of current tendencies that I end with a story about the national anthem.  In 1992 Trinity’s girls’ basketball team was playing in a Christmas Tournament at Brescia University.  As athletic director I was always looking to schedule our teams in such tournaments.  Barry McArdle, a public relations and recruitment specialist at Brescia, organized the event; and we played in it for a couple of years.  Shortly before our first game in the 1992 tournament, Barry came to me and said they would not be playing the national anthem.  Instead, a Brescia student would sing “God Bless America.”  He said, “After all, Larry, the national anthem glorifies violence.”  He then asked if what they were doing was okay with me.  I simply responded, “It’s your tournament!”  A short time later, a young Brescia student came to the scorers’ table visibly upset.  She said Mr. McArdle had just ordered her to sing both “God Bless America” and the national anthem even though she had not practiced the “Star Spangled Banner.”  This was probably my most satisfying point in the political wars at Trinity High School."
3,Explaining Civil Litigation,politics," Lawyers can build their careers across various fields, from family lawyers to corporate attornies. One common field of practice is civil litigation. Civil litigation attorneys work with cases with no criminal charges or penalties. Instead, civil litigation attorneys work with various kinds of non-criminal legal disputes in which plaintiffs are looking for some sort of compensation or damages. Read on to learn more about what it means to work as a civil litigator! What Kinds of Cases Do Litigators Handle? As mentioned above, civil litigators handle non-criminal legal disputes. This encompasses many different kinds of cases, so most lawyers working in civil litigation have just a couple of areas of expertise. Civil litigation cases might include landlord and tenant disputes, personal injury claims, intellectual property disputes, medical malpractice claims, education law disputes, and more. Unlike in criminal cases, where the prosecution has to present evidence that proves their case beyond a reasonable doubt, civil litigation trials only require convincing evidence. What Skills Do Litigators Need? Civil litigation requires similar skills as other areas of law. Litigators need to have extensive knowledge of local and federal laws related to their area of practice, strong communication skills, negotiation skills, and more. Negotiation can be critical in litigation cases. Many litigation cases never go to trial, so negotiating terms to resolve the issue outside of the courtroom is a crucial skill. What Are the Steps to a Litigation Case? When a client hires a litigator for their case, the case goes through a particular process, just as in any legal procedure. When a potential client wants to pursue civil litigation against another party, their first step is to meet with a litigation attorney to discuss the case. The attorney will help explain the process and evaluate whether or not the client has a strong case. From there, if the client decides to proceed with the case, the attorney will do extensive research to build evidence. This will be followed by both involved parties filing pleadings, essentially explaining their sides of the issue. Once the court has received both pleadings, the case will enter the discovery stage. This is essentially an extension of the research phase, including witness interviews and fact gathering for each side to build their case. The discovery stage usually takes the most time. Once discovery is complete, the case enters pre-trial, which is the last step for many cases. In pre-trial, the attorneys for both the plaintiff and defendant begin negotiations, trying to reach an acceptable settlement outside of court. If an agreement cannot be reached, the trial will go to court, and a judge will decide the matter."
4,There is a problem with Ukraine,politics," There is a problem with Ukraine There is something going on in Ukraine which is just not as it appears.  Sophistication, complexity, and intrigue are the three best words to describe this beleaguered country.  To begin, there are essentially four main forces that are driving events in the nation.  They all compete with one another and have different agendas but have been drawn together to present a united front. First and foremost are foreign NGO’s and American foreign policy operatives.  Their goal is to make Ukraine a liberal democracy that will eventually achieve integration into NATO and the European Union.  These people are extremely efficient, and they have outflanked their opponents both in Ukraine and the outside world.  They effectively brought about two Revolutions, the Orange (2005) and the Maidan (2014).  At this point in time, they have established the narrative which a vast majority of the American public accept as fact. A few examples are worth noting.  Victoria Nuland was the State Department employee tasked with the overall implementation of American’s Ukraine policy.  During the Maidan Revolution, she was caught on tape organizing a new government and arranging who would be placed in key positions.  Most on the ideological spectrum agree that corruption in Ukraine has been a persistent problem.  Marie Yovanovitch, U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine from 2016-19, told Ukrainian officials who they could and could not investigate for corruption.  Vice President Joe Biden was the point man for Ukraine in the Obama Administration.  He threatened to withhold one billion dollars in aid if Ukraine did not fire a prosecutor who was investigating certain entities.  One important target under investigation was Burisma, a company that employed Biden’s son.  Alexander Vindman was a U. S. military and intelligence figure active in Ukraine.  He was so involved in security arrangements in the country that he was offered a leadership position in its armed forces. Since 2015 the government of Ukraine has been controlled by those who believe in liberal democracy.  They make up force number two and are totally dependent on the first force in order to win support from the outside world.  They’re not much different from the political elites in the United States which is to say they believe in democracy and Capitalism.  They maintain the absolute sovereignty of the people to decide their own fate irrespective of their big and powerful neighbor (Russia), and they make no concessions on territorial integrity.  All this would be fine if the country were in Western Europe, had a historically unified populous and culture, or a border that had a centuries old definition. Force number three is the oligarchs.  This group is made up of wealthy businessmen who, of course, have close ties to the first two.  Their economic power gives them leverage over the political process.  In the United States we call them billionaires.  Like Donald Trump before he was President, they have to hedge their bets by supporting those in positions of political power or those likely to be at some point.  Much of the corruption that is prevalent in Ukraine revolves around the oligarchs.  Because of their intricate connections in the government and among foreign operatives, it is difficult for the legal system to do much about their power, influence, and corruption. The fourth force is made up of fascists or Nazis.  It makes up the shock troops for the other groups.  During the Maidan Revolution, they carried the day by organizing protests, demonstrations, and violence.  They have a military force called the Azov battalion.  The battalion began as a private militia but was later incorporated into the Ukrainian army.  They are the ones who have been on the front lines in fierce fighting against Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.  It has been reported, I might add, that they have received military training from the United States.  A political party was organized by their leaders after 2015, but it received little to no support from the electorate. One might ask why the fascists would support liberal democracy.  Don’t they have more in common with Moscow than Kiev?  The answer is they can only exist in a democracy.  While democratic leaders deplore their ideology, they allow them to continue for three reasons:  they are beholden to them for support given during the Maidan Revolution, they depend on them to do the heavy fighting in Eastern Ukraine, and the ideal of democracy that all beliefs, however toxic, have the right to be expressed.  This third reason goes back to Voltaire, the great French philosopher, who stated that tolerance extends to those who believe in intolerance.  Putin, on the other hand, would have no tolerance for the Azov adherents.  He would purge them to the last man, and they know it. So what does all this have to do with American politics?  Well, actually, quite a lot!  In 2016 Donald Trump ran for President and began voicing skepticism about America fighting needless and endless wars abroad.  For Ukraine this did not look good.  To make matters worse, he hired Paul Manafort as his campaign director.  Manafort had previously worked in Ukraine as a campaign advisor for the President who was deposed in the Maidan Revolution.  At this point, Alexandra Chalupa enters the story.  Chalupa is the daughter of Ukrainian-American immigrants.  She is referred to by Wikipedia as a pro-Ukrainian activist and has worked at various times for the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.  She made it her goal to expose Manafort and thus paint the Trump campaign as a tool of Putin and Russia.  In her effort to do this, she worked with the Ukrainian government, the American Embassy in Ukraine, and allies in the United States Congress.  The project achieved some success as Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign when his Ukrainian contacts were publicly revealed. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee’s computer and the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign director, were hacked.  The contents were posted on various news sites including Wikileaks where it gained a widespread audience.  Needless to say, the material was very embarrassing to party leaders, the mainstream media, and Hillary.  Contrary to popular belief, the Committee’s computer server was not turned over to the FBI to determine the origin of the hack.  It was instead analyzed by CrowdStrike, a private cyber security firm.  Crowdstrike, not the intelligence agencies of the U. S. government, concluded that Russia was responsible for the hack. A co-founder and chief officer of CrowdStrike was Dmitri Alperovitch.  Alperovitch is a Russian who came to the United States in 1994 and later became an American citizen.  He has an intense dislike of Vladimir Putin and is a member of the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank and one of the NGO’s referred to in an earlier paragraph.  The Council makes no secret of its intent to promote liberal democracy in Ukraine and make the country a full fledged member of NATO.  One of the Ukrainian oligarchs is a significant donor to the Atlantic Council as is CrowdStrike. As is common knowledge, President Trump’s first impeachment revolved around Ukraine.  Alexander Vindman, Marie Yavonavitch and many career state department employees became star witnesses for the prosecution.  They thought Trump was blackmailing Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son who was heavily invested in Burisma (a Ukrainian energy company), and also CrowdStrike.  Trump had apparently bought into the idea promoted by many conservatives that the Democratic server had been relocated to Ukraine.  Putin may have lent credence to this idea as he supposedly told Trump that Ukraine was behind the theories advanced in the Steele Dossier that Russia was actively involved in helping Trump in the campaign of 2016. It is worth noting that Ukraine did start an investigation of Hunter Biden and Burisma after Trump was acquitted of the impeachment charges by the Senate.  After Joe Biden was elected President, however, the inquiry was dropped.  I guess this could all be justified as hedging your bets. Ukraine is now involved in a vicious war with Russia.  Ukraine may be the underdog in this fight, but it has many forces at its disposal.  The Ukrainian army is roughly equal in size to the invading Russian force, it has received drones from the West, the Trump and Biden Administrations have provided it with javelins (anti-tank weapons) and stinger missiles (anti-aircraft weapons), and its forces have received advanced military training from the West.  Whatever one may think about the two countries and its leaders, it is clear that Ukraine has important friends in high places and has decisively won the propaganda battle in the United States.  Public opinion more or less paints Ukraine as saintly and Russia as demonic.  The only other times I have seen such unanimity of opinion were after the Kennedy assassination, during the Watergate scandal, and following the events of 9/11.  And yet, I maintain based on the information presented in this article that there is a problem with Ukraine!"
5,Cyberwar History and Ukraine,politics," People are much more drawn to images of blown-up building, fires, mushroom clouds, refugees in dire circumstances, color pictures of pain that are better in black and white than they are to explanations of code or even fallout from code if it’s not resulting in something blown-up, fiery, or pictures of people in pain that are better in black and white. That is to say, while we see plenty of stories of ransomware, temporary business disruptions, and credit card & ID fraud, it’s not visceral. It goes by quickly on the page and in our minds. So, whatever happened to the stories we saw before the cyberattack age? When the US Cybercommand was  just a twinkle in some geeky eyes? What happened to the discussion that cyberattacks would engender kinetic responses? Bombs not electrons. Perhaps it was a sense of proportion. Perhaps it was a recognition that we consider that an increasing cyberwar, if responded to with bullets, might just result in use seeing those images of things that would be better in black and white on our own doorstep? Did we back off, or did sanity take hold in the minds of the planners? Let’s look at a little history. Back in 2003, a cyberattack originating from China - and christened, “Titan Rain,” by the US - managed to get access to loads of sensitive government information by compromising the systems of US government contractors and of government systems themselves. Only unclassified information was stolen, but the world woke up to this kind of attack. In 2004, the Joint Chiefs of Staff declared cyberspace an important domain of conflict alongside the air, land, sea, and space domains. No doubt, this was prompted by the reality of Titan Rain. As a culture, we were just starting to think about these things on a national level. In 2007, Estonia experienced a broad cyberattack that included their parliament, banks, and media. It was believed to have originated from Russia, or from Russian actors. NATO’s response was to create the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2007. Now, continents were beginning to wake to the threat and the need to do something about it. The Tailinn Manual The CCDCOE began to develop an extensive study and code about what how international law applies to cyber conflicts and cyberwarfare; these previous acts were beginning to be recognized as acts of war. Calling on legal scholars and legal practitioners that were experienced in cyber issues, the CCDCOE produced Tailinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in 2012. The Tailinn Manual declared that killing hackers in response to certain cyberattacks was justifiable. Killing hackers?! Meanwhile, other state-sponsored cyberattacks marched their way into the public consciousness. The Stuxnet Worm was developed to sabotage Iran’s nuclear development efforts – in particular, the centrifuges used to enrich uranium gas. It is believed to be the first malware designed to and succeeding in visiting physical destruction on physical equipment. Wired Magazine called it the first digital weapon. It's widely considered that the US and Israel collaborated over a period of 5 years to develop this malware. In 2009, Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, recognizing how important AND vulnerable important computers and networks were (are), directed the creation of USCYBERCOM. It is the unified command for the cyberspace domain in the US and the world. In 2016, the organization described the 2016 espionage ops against the Democratic National Committee while in the midst of a national election “serious business . . . [that] may destroy democracy.” Administration officials at the time considered that cyber weapons were so potentially destructive that they should be unleashed only on the direct orders of the Commander in Chief, like nuclear weapons. I do not know if there is an equivalent “Cyber Football.” Article 51 of the UN Charter allows individual countries to defend themselves and to band together to defend each other. It also allows the same if an armed attack is anticipated and recognizes the right to use force in such a situation. It allows cyberattacks to be considered an armed attack. In 2019, Israel did just this, by conducing airstrikes on a building that they said had Hamas members inside that were planning to launch a cyberattack on Israel. In 2021 the topic was up for noticeable public discussion again. NATO heads of state and government met at NATO’s North Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels and issued a communiqué that ultimately equates cyberattacks with kinetic attacks and leaves the possibility of military action against hackers on the table. Still, what we generally see is that cyberattacks - or anticipated cyberattacks - by states are dealt with by preemptive and after-the-fact punishing cyberattacks. Tit for tat, as it were, and even before the tat. Cyberwar in Action What we have seen in practice in Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014 and in Ukraine in 2021 is the “softening up” cyberattack. The attack used to diminish and disable defensive and living systems before a kinetic attack, rather than a kinetic attack in response to a cyberattack. Many said that the 2014-2015 cyberattacks were on a an entirely different – and grander – level than had been seen previously. Several Ukrainian banks and government agencies became inaccessible and malware – using a tool called “HermeticWiper” - was wiping data from hundreds of PCs and servers. But we’ve gotten used to common DDOS attacks, data-wiping and ransomware in recent years on the civilian level. It’s kind of taken for granted that these things are ongoing and all over. The use of cyberwar and kinetic war together has been labeled “hybrid warfare.” And yet, the world seems surprised that Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine in 2021 and 2022have been substantially less severe than anticipated. To be sure, they were and are ongoingly widespread. Hackers caused the Viasat satellites to become inoperative. But that may have affected Russian soldiers and commanders to lose connectivity as well. And said attack has been mitigated somewhat by the Musk’s activation of Starlink Internet satellites over Ukraine. Additionally, Ukrainian modems were zombie-fied by Russian malware, being used as nodes for targeted DDOD attacks within Ukraine. But the ruination from malware that was expected has not really seemed to occur. We haven't seen a cyber-Armageddon. Were they more pr? Were the US and/or the EU pumping up Ukraine’s cyber defenses or attacking the offensive cyber capabilities of Russia? The newspapers wonder about this and government sources overtly express surprise and confusion that there isn’t more cyber damage. I would be willing to wager that they know more about this than they are letting on. But then, isn’t that almost always the case? The coming days and weeks will tell us more about cyberwar in Ukraine. It’s possible that all-out disruption of Ukraine’s Internet will come to pass. We hope not. But one thing about this history stands out. We have not seen the kinetic response to cyberattacks on a wide scale that was being discussed a decade ago. Luck? Cooler heads? Invisible cyber counterattacks? Thoughts of a Cyber version the Mutually Assured Destruction doctrine that has, in theory, kept the world from launching nuclear war? Or is physical destruction on a massive scale enough to satisfy those bent on domination? These times we’re living in will surely shape the times we will be living in. Let us hope and work for that cyberwar doesn’t exceed the malign effects we have seen to date and that going forward we see fewer dire images because of fewer dire circumstances"
6,We Have Met the Enemy and He Is Us,politics," Cartoonist Walt Kelly modified and changed Commodore Perry’s famous quote to, “We have met the enemy and he is us” in a cartoon he created in 1970 celebrating the first Earth Day in 1970. The message being that man from his treatment of the earth is the planet’s enemy. It may also be true that the greatest enemy of democracy is not our corrupt leaders, but that a large part of our country’s citizens do not love or understand what democracy really means. If they do not love or want a free press that allows opposition and differences of opinion to flourish, then they do not love or want democracy. If legislators take away the rights of any minority and hamper free elections and the ability for every eligible citizen to easily cast a vote, then they do not love democracy. If school boards take books out of libraries as Texas is doing, because they consider the books too disturbing or controversial, then they are going down the path of the book burnings that happened in Nazi Germany and they do not love or want democracy.  Instead of democracy they want only their own opinions and their own laws to prevail and flourish and are willing to vote for leaders who will give them what they want. But leaders who willingly lie and bend the laws to obtain power eventually take away not only the rights of the minorities they oppose, but also ultimately take away all their citizens rights as we have seen in other countries that have become authoritarian and have lost their democracy. In the United States we are  on a dangerous road toward losing our freedom. If in the next few elections the people vote for leaders with selfish and corrupt motives and authoritarian tendencies, then the voters will ultimately be responsible for giving away their precious freedom and once you give away your freedom, it is very difficult and perhaps impossible to ever get it back. In a Democracy everyone has a voice and is worthy of respect. Poor people, rich people, minorities and majorities and people of different religions and different ethnicities. If a voter does not believe in that, then they do not love democracy. That is the dilemma that the voters in America will soon be facing in the coming elections in 2022 and 2024. How many voters still love democracy and are willing to vote for and support leaders who will protect it? The future of our country and the future and well-being of our children and all future generations are now in the hands of all of us who are voters—an awesome and frightening responsibility. We must now all work and fight to protect our ability to vote. We must fight for the ""For the People act of 2021"" that will help to protect every citizen’s right to vote. We must all make an effort to get the information we need from many different reliable sources so we can become wise and informed voters and ultimately cast our vote for leaders who will always protect our democracy and the rule of law and keep it forever strong and safe. Democracy needs every voter now as it has never before needed all of us to work and fight for its very survival."
7,A Society in Transition,politics," We all are aware that change in our personal lives is difficult, constant, and inevitable. We notice it when we look in the mirror or see our children grow. What is not so noticeable, however, but is also constant is the change that happens in our country and our world. That change happens so gradually that we don’t always notice it until those changes have made the world that we always knew unrecognizable. I was born before television and computers were in every household and our world then was different and slower-paced. That world, however, is gone now. We can’t get it back and we probably would not want it back. How would we live without our televisions and our computers? There is a segment of our society today that is nostalgic about the past and wants to return to the “good old days”,  but much of the “good old days” was not so admirable. When I was a child we simply accepted discrimination against minorities as normal. We accepted the career limits of women and the limitations on the role of minorities in society as normal. More of our young people today are going to college because of the availability of student loans and they expect their country to give equal opportunity and equality to all of its citizens without exceptions. This more inclusive attitude of a large part of our society is now a threat to those who have held power for a very long time and have denied equal rights to so many people for their own personal gain. When a part of our society denies that climate change is happening, it is because they don’t want to give up the oil and other benefits which make them rich. They are only aware of their self-interest and really don't care that they are damaging the environment or our country.  If they do not want equality for minorities, it is because it serves their self-interest to keep wages and benefits low. These people, who put self-interest before the interests of society, cannot hold back progress indefinitely. They are on the wrong side of history. People in every age have been striving to make their lives better and although it often takes a long time to change prevailing thought and achieve their goals, they inevitably do win. Black people after a very long time of being exploited were eventually freed from slavery. Women, after a long and dangerous struggle, eventually won the right to vote. More and more people are signing on to do the right thing rather than the expedient thing. We must all be prepared to go into the future and embrace the inevitable changes ahead which will ultimately change and also enrich our lives.. Our cities will eventually look different and be more diverse and we will all need to become more tolerant of different religions and ideas and different ways of thinking and living. Tolerance and acceptance for the benefit of all–that is the ultimate goal and the ultimate meaning of democracy and freedom."
8,The Assault on Science,politics," When I was a young girl, there was a great respect for people of science (doctors, scientists etc.). We trusted them and felt that the contributions of all of our world scientists had made our lives healthier and better. Therefore I was very surprised and disappointed when in 2021 after 50 years of warnings from 97% of our most prestigious scientists that we are still living in a dangerous time of climate change our legislators have as yet not taken the actions they need to take to protect us from this life-threatening calamity. The Worlds most Prestigious Scientific Organizations believe that the Climate is Warming The following is a partial list of scientific organizations along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources. Statement on Climate Change from 18 Scientific Associations “Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.” (2009) Climate deniers are often funded by corporations, companies and individuals who for their own economic interests do not want environmental protection laws that will limit their profits. American Association for the Advancement of Science “The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society.” (2006) American Chemical Society “Comprehensive scientific assessments of our current and potential future climates clearly indicate that climate change is real, largely attributable to emissions from human activities, and potentially a very serious problem.” (2004) American Geophysical Union “Human‐induced climate change requires urgent action. Humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years. Rapid societal responses can significantly lessen negative outcomes.” (Adopted 2003, revised and reaffirmed 2007, 2012, 2013) American Medical Association “Our AMA … supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant.” (2013) American Meteorological Society “It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide.” (2012) American Physical Society “The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth’s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.” (2007) The Geological Society of America “The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s.” (2006; revised 2010) There is only a small window of time left for us to act on this life-threatening problem for our planet before we will no longer be able to protect ourselves from this dangerous calamity. International Academies: Joint Statement “Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems. It is likely that most of the warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities (IPCC 2001).” (2005, 11 international science academies) National Academy of Sciences “The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.” (2005) U.S. Global Change Research Program “The global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases. Human ‘fingerprints’ also have been identified in many other aspects of the climate system, including changes in ocean heat content, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and Arctic sea ice.” (2009, 13 U.S. government departments and agencies) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal and since the 1950s many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed. The amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.” “Human influence on the climate system is clear and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.” List of Worldwide Scientific Organizations This page lists the nearly 200 worldwide scientific organizations that hold the position that climate change has been caused by human action. Source information: NASA –Global climate change Climate Deniers “Unfortunately there is also a long list of climate deniers who have made a living out of denying the science of climate change. These so-called ‘experts’ often start out their statements with ‘I’m not a climate scientist, but…’ before launching into a series of carefully rehearsed talking points meant to confuse the public on the climate change issue. A great many of them are well-paid operatives of organizations like The Heartland Institute, CFACT, and Americans for Prosperity, which take contributions from fossil fuel corporations — including ExxonMobil, the Koch Brothers and their company Koch Industries — who seek to delay or block any substantial government policy initiatives meant to curb fossil fuel emissions or hasten the rapid growth of cheaper, cleaner sources of energy like wind and solar.” – Source information: Before the flood In  2019, 1.1 million students skipped school for a climate strike protest. These are young people and young voters who care about their future and  took action to show our politicians that they are concerned about what is happening to our environment and to their future. They are also aware that the Republicans in Congress because of their own self-interest and economic greed have been fighting to prevent any constructive action on addressing climate change and making our country and world safer. In 2021 and 2022  we all will have the opportunity to make our voices heard again on this important life and death issue. If we make the wrong choice at the ballot box, this country and this earth that we love so much, and our children and all future generations will ultimately pay the price of living on a more dangerous and life-threatening planet. Now is the time that we must all commit ourselves to protect this fragile earth from that unthinkable fate."
9,The Evolution and Effects of Quebec Independence Movement,politics," The independence movement in Quebec is not really a recent phenomenon, in fact, nationalistic feelings in French Canadians in forming a nation of their own has its root in pre-industrial Quebec or New France, when the inhabitants there adhered on becoming ‘Canadienne’ – a single, unique group of people living separately with their own identity from mother country France. The fall of New France to the British in 1759 only amplified nationalistic feelings inside the inhabitants of New France who were being dominated politically, economically, and culturally by the British. Indeed, the modern history of the independence movement in Quebec began in the 1960s when “the people of the province began to question the assumptions on which their apparent placid, unchanging society was founded.”  The movement slowly gained prominence in the following three decades until the sovereignty referendum of 1980. The eventual rise of the movement between the 1960s through the 1980s could be traced back through events in the following chronological order: the demise of Duplessis government and emergence of a liberal government under Jean Lesage ushering in the renewal of Quebec’s economic and social institutions, the emergence of Quiet Revolution in the early 1960s, the language movement, the surfacing of Parti Quebecoise as a political force in Quebec and finally the referendum on Quebec sovereignty in 1980. The movement and the referendum that followed have made us Canadians question the very basis of our Canadian society; it shook the foundation of the Canadian state with the very existence of the country being in question. Amongst the most profound effects of the independence movement of Quebec is the redefining of Canada as a federal state sponsoring the notion of being a truly bilingual yet a multicultural society and the transformation of French Canadian nationalism into Quebec nationalism. The death of Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis in September 1959 marked the end of Grande noirceur – the dark age that had absorbed Quebec. “Down to 1959 or 1960 Quebec was governed through a deeply conservative political system that produced regular majorities for a premier, Maurice Duplessis, who proclaimed the superiority and the desirability of doing things the old way, preserving the old values of Quebec’s Catholic society.“   He ruled Quebec like a quasi-dictator in promoting and preserving the status-quo in Quebec. “No less than other societies Quebec was challenged by urbanization, industrialization, secularism and other facets of modernization. But to a greater degree than other societies, Quebec resisted thrust of modernization, fearing that accommodation with them would have grave social consequences, undermining its values and threatening the survival of its people.”  The premier who succeeded Duplessis was Jean Lesage, who was a liberal and a top minister under Louis St-Laurent. Lasage is credited with moving Quebec forward after the ‘dark era.’ Under Lesage’s leadership, the Liberals had ended the sixteen-year rule of the Union National Party in Quebec promising sweeping reforms in government institutions such as education, healthcare, and social welfare etc. In fact, education, healthcare, and social welfare were controlled by the Catholic clergy largely prior to the revolution. The working class, as it became increasingly urban dwellers, felt that these public institutions under the Church were unable to react to and meet their needs.  With the on slot of higher fertility rate in the general population after the Second World War and baby-boomers increasingly coming into the workforce, the Catholic Church was in lack of the resources and personnel in properly conducting these social intuitions with the altered demographic conditions. So they were forced to employ more laymen. Moreover, the change of values espoused by Quebecers which were increasingly liberal and secular, together with the decrease of religiosity in the mindset of ordinary people in Quebec resulted in reducing the role and authority of the Church in society. The reforms undertaken by the state resulted in liberalizing and transforming Quebec society and ultimately ushered in the Quiet Revolution.  According to William D. Coleman: “The independence movement was not the instigator of the Quiet Revolution or even part of that revolution, Rather it was a consequence, a product of the series of changes that began to be realized in Quebec late in the 1950s.“  The Quiet Revolution, heralded as the root of the independence movement, according to Herbert Guindon, lay in the modernization of Quebec which began with the large-scale involvement of the provincial government in Quebec society, in the early 1960s.  But this does not tell the whole story, the Quiet Revolution was not just a change in government policy, instead, it was a change in spirit or atmosphere and a change in attitude in traditional Quebec society.  “In ten years there was a radical change that affected ways of thinking, ideologies, culture… It was like a pot whose lid was kept in place by the Duplessis system; when someone dared to open it, it exploded.” Through the Quiet Revolution, French Canada had united in a new re-invigorated form and the future of the nation seemed to be of enormous promise. It was short-lived though and when it disappeared some felt loss of self-worth and their disappointment fuelled the independence movement.  The effect of the revolution became visible as the independent movement formed with the creation of the Mouvement Souverainte-Association (MSA), the predecessor of Parti Quebecoise in 1967.  “In 1967, Quebec was catapulted onto the international scene by the Montreal World’s Fair (Expo’67) that drew hordes of visitor…and was a major milestone in rising Quebec nationalism…Sovereignists were ignited by [French President] General de Gaulles’ shout from the balcony of Montreal City Hall: ‘Vive le Quebec…libre!’ That Fall, the Parti Quebecoise coalesced under Rene Levesque.” The commencement of the independence movement can be traced back to the labor dispute in Radio-Canada in 1959. The producers in the institution tried to start a labour union with the management strongly opposing such a move. The producers went on strike which lasted two months. In the end, the people blamed the Canadian Parliament and the Confederation itself for the wrong-doing, not the management of Radio-Canada or the Minister responsible. This highly symbolic event signifies the external political and economic pressure that is inflicted upon the development of Quebec society.  Some fifteen years later, the Radio-Canada incident resulted in the election of Parti Quebecoise. The Radio-Canada incident influenced the people’s opinion in Quebec, made them feel alienated, and made them question the degree of participation of francophones in federal institutions. Georges-Emile Lapalme, who was the leader of the Quebec Liberal Party from 1950 to 1958, is considered one of the fathers of the Quiet Revolution. In 1958 he wrote a manifesto in which he specified all the reforms necessary for the development of Quebec, which became the basis for the Quiet Revolution. He expressed a new role for the Quebec state which would lead the way for Quebec’s economic emancipation. To fight Duplessis’s policies, he put forward a notion of progressive nationalism. His ideas were taken up by Lesage in his election campaign. Through Lapalme’s ideas, Quebec nationalism became linked with social reform, a step forward from Duplessis’s nationalism that was based on conservative ideology. This new form of nationalism had its downturn as well as “this independence movement among French-speaking Quebecois is producing a new form of nationalism, one that often embodies a hostile and isolationist approach in pursuit of political, social and economic recognition. This new nationalism, along with multiculturalism, is affecting Canada's national identity as more people are unsure about their roots. These unexpected changes that have taken place in Canada have raised many questions about the country's future.”  Lapalm intended to have the Quebec state play a much important role in the economic development of Quebec instead of waiting for Ottawa to take the initiative, but this had a negative consequence as this neo-nationalism made Quebec going in the direction of isolationism – Quebec government doing what is necessary for its socio-political and economic development paying no heed to Ottawa and the rest of Canada, for example, the inaction of the Bill 101 which exemplifies the whole question of the Language Movement in Quebec to which we turn next. The Language Question in Quebec emerged as the next wave of political force behind the independence movement in Quebec.  The French Canadians were the majority in the province of Quebec with their French language, but in the Canadian federation, they were the minority. The language question – the status of French in Canada was exemplified first by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. “It examined income, occupation, and ethnicity, and revealed that in Quebec, the province where they were a majority, French Canadians were firmly at the bottom of the income and occupation heap. In federal institutions, French Canadians were simply not proportionately represented, and when they were, it was in low-status and low-paying jobs.”  So the Quebec government enacted legislation to protect their language and culture and in the years that followed, Quebec increasingly demanded for control of its cultural institutions. Looking back at Jean Lesag’s slogan: ‘maitres chez nous’ (‘masters in our own home’), of Daniel Johnson’s ‘L’egalite ou l’independance’ (equality or independence) or the enactment of Bill 101, Bill 178 and the language police”- all these events point to the fact that Quebec’s survival as a nation are directly linked to French language regulations. In 1974 the government under Robert Bourassa, a federalist Liberal, proposed to enact Bill 22, la loi sur la langue officielle that replaced a 1969 bill. Bill 22 established French as the language of workplace and government institutions. It also limited English education to only those Anglophone students who had prior education in the English medium.   They had to take an entry test to attend English schools. Bourassa was unable to win the battle he had started; only Rene Levesque was trusted enough by the Quebecers to settle the language issue, as history demonstrated.  “ Parti Quebecoise had become the only political force radical enough to make drastic changes without  concessions to the English minority and credible enough to be trusted by a population who believed the traditional parties to be linked to the still-powerful English minority.”  Rene Levesque acknowledged that it was deplorable that a nation had to legislate to validate the use of its own language in work and business, but he believed it had to be done, as a matter of survival for French Canadians who had been an enslaved race for so long. The emergence of Parti Quebecoise (PQ) was the next major event that flourished the independence movement in Quebec. “Quebec was burning and by the end of turbulent 1960s, separatism had quickly gone from being a fringe ideology to become a feasible option.”  It was a tumultuous time as a militant terrorist organization named The Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) emerged prior to the emergence of the PQ and bombed federal mailboxes, assassinated labour and manpower minister Pierre Laporte and kidnapped British diplomat James Cross. Events in the next two decades would rock the whole of Canada to its core. Bill 101, a brainchild of PQ government was “a deliberate attempt by Parti Quebecoise to create a symbol, to show the people of ‘the country of Quebec’ that the clock had been turned back, the battle of the Plains of Abraham had been won, after all, their struggle for survival was over, and that a new life – the one the fathers and mothers of New France would have wanted - was starting.” The Parti Quebecoise defeated the Liberal government of Bourassa and came to power in 1976 which marked the renewal of the Quiet Revolution and its completion.  It was a historic moment for the people of Quebec because the Quiet Revolution was brought to the front again with its nationalist dimension. But it was not a triumph for the sovereignists yet, as in 1976 the PQ did not run on the issue of separatism rather its campaign was on the issue of good governance.  The Liberal Bourassa’s campaign was plagued by accusations of widespread corruption during its rule. PQ promised to bring the issue of independence only after a Quebec-wide referendum within five years of winning the election. In the 1980 referendum, Quebecers were asked to decide on whether to allow the government to negotiate sovereignty-association with Ottawa. “ This agreement would enable Quebec to acquire the exclusive power to make its laws, levy its taxes and establish relations abroad – in other words, sovereignty – and at the same time, to maintain with Canada an economic association including a common currency.”  Finally, the province-wide referendum took place on May 20, 1980, and the proposal to pursue secession was defeated by a 59.56 percent to 40.44 percent margin. The yes side primarily lost because of the lack of support from the Quebec businessmen. Prior to the referendum, Levesque tried to woo the business community by reassuring that sovereignty would ultimately benefit everybody including businessmen, but the business community was not moved by the assurances.  Maurice Seguin, a controversial and renowned Quebec historian doubts whether Quebec’s independence is even possible – “So on the one hand, he saw the tragedy of this conquered nation, in a minority position, for which independence was a desirable end. But on the other hand, he said: ‘It is so well kept, maybe the best-kept nation in the world, and these golden chains make its liberation difficult to achieve.”  Since Quebec was so well kept by others in current federal Canada, he doubted whether Quebec could ever achieve independence. The effects that the independence movement on Quebec and Canada between the 1960s and 1980s are: the redefining of Canada as a federal nation espousing a truly multicultural society- it is bilingual in orientation but multiethnic in composition. Another effect would be the evolution of nationalism in Quebec from French Canadian nationalism to Quebecoise nationalism. First, Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau was a powerful force on the ‘no’ side of the referendum. To contain the rising tide of Quebec nationalism, he implemented a number of strategies like promoting bilingualism with the Official Language Act of 1969, increasing francophone representation in federal government services, and increasing French language services of Radio-Canada throughout Canada.   He termed ’Quebec Nationalism’ as being ‘dead’ and proposed a renewed and revitalized form of federalism in Canada. He also proposed more economic presence of the federal government’s in the province of Quebec only if the yes side was defeated.   “Trudeau’s concept of Canada, while completely rejecting what he called Quebec nationalism, had this important aspect to it that is minority language rights across the country.“   Promoting bilingual services with minority French language established as one of Canada’s both official languages. The second effect of the independence movement was the emergence of Quebec nationalism in place of the French Canadian nationalism – to have a clearer and precise identity – a Quebec identity. This new identity defined being a Quebecoise in territorial terms; it included people living in Quebec including non-francophone people who live here. Quebec has to become more multi-ethnic to keep pace with the globalized world with increased migration. “The idea of Quebec is not and cannot be an ethnic idea; it has to be a cultural idea, encompassing people of diverse origins.” In conclusion, the rise of the independence movement is characterized by events such as the fall of the Duplessis regime and emergence of a liberal government under Jean Lesage, renewal of Quebec’s economic and social institutions, the emergence of the Quiet Revolution in the early 1960s, the language movement, the emergence of Parti Quebecoise as a political force in Quebec and finally the sovereignty referendum in 1980. Some might think that the Quebec independence movement lasted only a few decades, they are quite mistaken in understanding the history of Quebec nationalism. The roots of the movement went back to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It may have increased in certain eras and abated in other times, but it came back again and again. The only constant in the history of Quebec is the rise in self-assertion and questioning its link with Canada and finding its place in the federal system.  It may become a time when the Quebecers will completely assimilate themselves in Canada so that there would be no necessity for Quebec nationalism. Quebec nationalism may not be eternal but as long as there are people in Canada who speak French it will always come back to remind us of the struggle that has happened in Quebec through its independence movement.  The contending fact is that without the rest of Canada acting as an increasingly bilingual buffer promoting bilingualism and biculturalism, Quebec would become more and more isolated from the North American mainstream.

10,"Covid Conspiracies and the Animal Rights community in Victoria, Australia",politics," Let us think rationally if that is possible. Why would any government, left, right, or in the middle, proceed with the up-popular choice of a lockdown if they did not believe it was the only choice available at the time? Seriously think about that. I grew up with politics being something that one should always take notice of. As a child, there was always political talk happening around the house. My parents were both politically engaged and encouraged their children to be the same. Mum didn't just watch a little April cry, absolutely devastated at the sight of the Dolphin slaughter in Japan, instead Mum offered actions I could take for positive change (an animal rights activist was born). I was not taught to blindly accept what our governments or other authorities put forward, but rather to question and fight for change if I felt it was needed. I have lived my life like that and have taught my children the same. For those in the movement of animal rights who are on the side of covid deniers, anti-vaxxers or so-called freedom fighters; do you realise what calling for the sacking of Dan Andrews would mean? Who do you propose an alternative - Michael O'Brien? The re-hashed Matthew Guy? Seriously, anyone from the right side of politics? As an example of where the loyalties of the Liberal/coalition lie, the previous Agriculture Minister in the Dennis Napthine Coalition Government, Peter Walsh, (who still sits in parliament), told me he felt sorry for me not having dairy in my diet, and no, he would not change the legal stance of baby calves allowed to go 30 hours without food and water before these babies are slaughtered. No, this also has not changed under our current state government of the Labor party, but a whole lot has in the positive direction for animals. I seriously encourage you to look through the voting history of the right and see that animals have ZERO HOPE under a Liberal/coalition government. The Liberal/coalition's stance on anything is making a dollar, especially off someone they can exploit and enslave as easily as animals. Yes, I am firmly rusted on the left side of politics. I come from a working-class family and stand with workers and the unions that support them. I also stand with anyone, no matter their species, who is disadvantaged or discriminated against. I was not always like this, although, always left. I didn't see my learned racism. I didn't see my learnt sexism. My family are not horrible people, but there is subtle and not so subtle racism and sexism. I met a beautiful man when I was 19, and he was patient with me. No, he was/is not perfect – like all of us – far from it, but he has always been one to fight against most 'isms', particularly racism (like me, he is learning to un-learn our subtle sexism). At the risk of sounding like a complete tosser, we are all on a journey of learning. We all want someone to blame or rail against, but sometimes there is no one to blame. Humans are not immune to disease. It is arrogant to suggest this. Coming up with a conspiracy theory and claiming that Covid 19 is not real suggests that arrogance. We are susceptible to disease, and we have had pandemics reign upon our species before. We are a smart species in some ways (yet so so stupid in others – think climate change). We are smart enough to keep beating Mother Nature as she tries to curb our species on this planet – and quite rightly so when you look at the damage our species causes. We can fight disease with the invention of many medicines. I'm sure even the anti-vaxxers have all had a dose or two of penicillin in their lives. We also have vaccines that have almost irradicated certain diseases that attack our species – like measles and polio. I believe in science. Science and the scientists that study and research our planet and all who inhabit it are incredible. That is why I trust the science that these scientists have come up with to battle this pandemic, and I urge all to do the same so we can all move forward and overcome this Covid 19 virus. I also urge all to adopt a vegan diet to prevent more zoonotic diseases from attacking our species. This change also makes a massive positive contribution to stopping climate change, and the best thing about living vegan - you are no longer a contributor to animal suffering."
11,Democracy in the Crosshairs,politics," I have been a witness to the democratic process for many, many years. I have participated in numerous elections that have brought to office Democrats and Republicans of various philosophies and styles, but I have never before been worried through all of these various changes that our democracy was in danger of not surviving. A democracy is based on the rule of law and when there is an assault on our laws, that is an assault on our democracy. Because I am so concerned, I have been paying more attention to the political changes that are occurring not only in our country but also in the world. I have begun to realize that what is happening in our country is not an isolated event, but is also happening all over Europe. Right wing parties and leaders are running on the same hate agenda as our former president and the current Republican party and getting elected. That agenda is immigration issues and stoking long simmering hatreds and using these issues to gain power and install systematic corruption. The rise of right-wing nationalism in Europe is widespread, and it is making gains in the following countries: Italy–17.4% Germany– 12.6% Spain–10% Austria–26% France –13% Sweden—17.6% Estonia—17.8% Hungary–49%–19% Anti-immigrant laws are being passed in-- Denmark–21% The Netherlands–13% The Czech Republic–11% Right-wing nationalists across Europe and also here in America are now sensing an opportunity. The immigration issue is the catalyst that is causing this world fear and intolerance and is a world problem which must be confronted and solved by all freedom loving people in all the countries of Europe and America working together. Because of climate change, natural disasters, wars, gangs and dictatorships around the world, and the ending of the war in Afghanistan, large numbers of refugees are fleeing their countries to try to survive. This will only continue to increase if the world does not become more stable. What will happen to these millions of refugees? Will the world close their eyes to the fate of all of these vulnerable people and this overwhelming human crisis and pretend it is not happening or should the compassionate countries of the world get together to solve this enormous problem by taking action? World leaders working together must now begin to stabilize those countries at risk and address the problems that are causing this flight of refugees. Leaders need to decide on a fair number of refugees that each country can absorb. if they don’t begin to address these unsolved problems, their inaction will ultimately destabilize the whole world. We need to be very concerned about what is happening. If we are not aware of this assault on world democracy, then we are all in danger of eventually losing our freedom both in America and elsewhere in the world. When hate becomes the norm, not only refugees and minorities are at risk, but it endangers the freedom of all of us. We must become more aware of this imminent danger to democracy and do all that we can to ensure that this catastrophe will never happen here."
12,The Continuing Fight for Equality,politics," “We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are created equal. That they are endowed, by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""-- Thomas Jefferson 1801-1809 The congress will be voting soon on the voting rights Bill HR1—the For the People Act. Why are we still fighting for equality and the right to free access to voting for all of our citizens in 2021.The Republicans in state legislatures in many states are passing bills to limit access to voting. They have already passed over 200 bills to do that. In a democracy that is unacceptable and limits all of our rights and ultimately will destroy our democracy. We, the people, cannot allow them to do this. That is why voting rights bill HR1 must pass and be a protection for us all. The United States and the world have been fighting discrimination for as long as people have walked on this earth. It has been the Catholics against the Protestants, discrimination against the Jews, Jews in conflict with Palestinians, crimes against Chinese workers and other Asians, The Crusades--Christians against the Muslims. Arab tribes against each other. intolerance between whites and blacks. The truth is that people do not like or trust others who are different than they are. It takes understanding and wisdom to learn to get along even in loving families. We have come to a point in our world that we must learn to live together in peace and harmony or we will all ultimately die together because unless we learn to come together and solve our difficult problems together this civilization will ultimately disintegrate through nuclear destruction or unaddressed natural disasters like climate change. Most of our religions have all tried to teach us to love and respect each other, but unfortunately some have also caused us to distrust anyone who is different.. Our moral and ethical leaders have worked hard to bring us closer to becoming more tolerant of differences. We cannot and should not force other people, whether it is our families or our fellow citizens, to think and feel as we do, but we must learn to respect the opinions and the choices of others as long as they also respect our opinions and our choices. We must all learn to make the effort to live together with respect and in peace. I don't know what the religions or political opinions or races of my neighbors on my street are, but we have all lived side by side for many years—each living the life that suits them and we are a good community. Each of us must now look into our own hearts and root out the distrust that we might feel for those who are different from us and begin to live with more respect and tolerance for every human being in the US and in the world. We must reject words and deeds of intolerance and hate whether they come from our families, our religions, our communities, our TV's or our social media. Respect and tolerance for all human beings is the only option that will ultimately save our democracy and our planet."
13,A Question of Survival,politics," Recently I was watching the movie Conquest of Paradise with Gerard Depardieu, a movie about Columbus and his discovery of the new world. As I was watching the cruelty that occurred in those days (1492)– the Spanish Inquisition and the brutality of what was done to the native populations when soldiers from a foreign country came in and killed them at will and took everything they possessed, I realized that although more than 500 years have passed and our world has changed in so many ways, we are still killing each other at the same pace and for the same reasons as we did so many hundreds of years ago. Why, when the world has become so modern with the invention of cars, planes, new medical techniques our enhanced communication through the internet and so much new knowledge about psychology and the better understanding of the subconscious motivations and drives of human beings, why then are we still functioning in this primitive, brutal way. With vast numbers of smart, educated people able to achieve so many modern inventions and innovations to make our lives safer and better and our astronauts exploring the vastness of outer space, why is it that these same smart, educated people still cannot figure out how we can learn to get along with each other better both in our families or in our world. I think perhaps the answer is that no one is really willing to make the effort and spend the required money to try to solve these most important and crucial world issues on which our very survival is ultimately dependent. Our scientists have already warned us that we have now come to the tipping point in our civilization. We will either begin to collectively work with our world partners to face the real problems of our world or we will all continue to go on as we have with blinders on and go to our destruction together in the not too distant future. Why are we not facing our world problems with wisdom and determination to find solutions? I think that our leaders and our citizens are just so ill-equipped and frightened to look at the reality and the challenges of the future that we all just want pretend that everything is fine and there are no problems. It is called denial! To solve climate change will mean changing our society in many new ways. It will mean changing from fossil fuels to renewable energy, with the loss of old ways and old jobs and the beginning of new technologies and new jobs. “Humanity will have given up on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems.” Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, has implored governments to ensure 2021 is not just another “year of conferences” on the ongoing ecological destruction of the planet, urging countries to take definitive action on deforestation, pollution and the climate crisis. “Humanity will have given up on planet Earth if world leaders cannot reach an agreement this year to stop the mass extinction of wildlife and destruction of life-supporting ecosystems,” the United Nation’s new biodiversity chief has warned. Change is always hard and is resisted by many, but when survival is at stake we don’t have any more options. It must be done and as Elizazbeth Maruma Mrema warns it must be done now–this year– 2021. Another challenge that is destabilizing the world is the intermingling of people of different backgrounds, religions and race. Many populations are being displaced because of internal conflicts, climate change and natural disasters. All religions teach us to be tolerant and respect our fellow man. It is time that we followed our oldest values of love and respect. It is often difficult to tolerate others who look and think differently than we do, but if we respect each other and strive to learn to understand each other better and to live together in peace, than although our world will look different and be different than it is now, it will be one of stability and harmony. If every citizen and every leader dedicates himself to working toward these goals now, addressing climate change and dealing wisely and humanely with displaced populations than perhaps we can still avoid the imminent disaster that is awaiting our world in our lifetime."
