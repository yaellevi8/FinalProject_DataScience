0,9 Health Benefits of Kale,health-fitness," Are you having problems gaining the minerals in your diet that you need? Want to have peace of mind that you are getting all the essential minerals your body needs to stay healthy? Well, here are nine easy ways kale can quickly help. But first, a bit about the kale vegetable. Kale (Brassica oleracea, variety acephala) is a vegetable from the brassica family of plants originating from the northern Mediterranean. 9 Health Benefits of Kale #1. Kale is a CRUCIFEROUS vegetable and one of the most nutritious foods in the world. Like broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower, kale is packed with health-promoting biological compounds such as antioxidants. The most common variety of kale is Curly kale or Scots kale, which has green and curly leaves and a hard, fibrous stem. Shetland Kale is the oldest known variety, grown since at least the 17th Century. The dropped leaves were used as winter feed for farm animals. A cup of raw kale contains: •	Vitamin A: TWICE the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA), via beta-carotene, for good eyesight and the immune system •	Vitamin K: SEVEN times the RDA for the blood and bones •	Vitamin C: more than the RDA for growth and tissue repair •	Vitamin B6: about a tenth of the RDA for the nervous and immune systems •	Manganese: a quarter of the RDA for tissues, bones, blood, and sex hormones •	Calcium: about a tenth of the RDA for bones and teeth •	Copper: a tenth of the RDA for the bones, blood vessels, immune and nervous systems, and iron absorption •	Potassium: about a tenth of the RDA for the heart, muscles, and nerves •	Magnesium: six percent of the RDA for bone and cellular health •	Three percent or more of the RDA for vitamin B1 (thiamin), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), iron, and phosphorus The same cupful of kale contains just 33 calories, 6 g carbohydrates, 2 g fiber, and 3 g protein. The tiny amount of fat in kale comes as the beneficial omega-3 alpha-linolenic fatty acid. Now you know why KALE is among the most NUTRIENT-DENSE foods. #2. Kale contains the antioxidants QUERCETIN and KAEMPFEROL. Antioxidants help prevent oxidative damage by harmful FREE RADICALS. Kale contains relatively large amounts of antioxidant flavonoids like QUERCETIN and KAEMPFEROL. These compounds have been found to protect the heart and help to reduce blood pressure. #3. Kale is an ideal source of VITAMIN C, which is needed for collagen synthesis, the most abundant structural protein in the human body. That is why the vitamin is essential to repair damage to tissues, which happens every day to all of us. The vegetable provides more vitamin C than most others – almost five times more than spinach and more than a whole orange. #4. Kale is the best source of VITAMIN K. Scientists have found that vitamin K activates protein-binding calcium. As mentioned above, a cupful of raw kale contains almost seven times the RDA. That is enormous. Vitamin K1 helps to fight heart disease and osteoporosis. #5. Kale is packed with BETA-CAROTENE, an antioxidant that eventually becomes vitamin A, which is good for eyesight and immunity. #7. Kale is a rich source of CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, and POTASSIUM. The vegetable is rich in calcium for bones and cellular health. It is also a good source of magnesium, which helps combat type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The potassium in kale helps maintain the right electrical potential in cells to regulate blood pressure. #8. Kale is LOW in OXALATE. Oxalate seems to prevent minerals from being absorbed, which can cause serious health problems. #9. Kale is high in LUTEIN and ZEAXANTHIN. These are potent nutrients that are good for eyesight, especially for older folks. Lutein and zeaxanthin are CAROTENOID antioxidants present in large amounts in kale. These antioxidants greatly help reduce the risk of macular degeneration and cataracts, two prevalent eye disorders in aging folk. All in all, kale is a vegetable full of antioxidants that may help fight several maladies. It is exceptionally high in vitamins A, C, and K and is part of a healthy diet. If you know what you are doing, the above will help you get and maintain the essential minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants your body needs from kale. The vegetable is best eaten raw. Your ultimate levels of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants from kale can be reached if you take note of the principles given in this article. Getting the proper mineral balance is not a pipe dream and has nothing to do with genetic makeup. Use the information here, and very soon, you will have confidence and satisfaction that you have the correct minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, and especially the vitamins your body needs that come from kale."
1,The Importance of Skincare & the Benefits of Natural Skin Care Products,health-fitness," According to Desmond Morris, the most prized human characteristic is perfect skin. It promotes health, happiness, and fertility. Because of the importance of skincare, people of all ages are looking for the most effective products available. They ask their friends, dermatologists, and favourite bloggers for recommendations on items that will give them the results they want. As a result, individuals frequently purchase costly skincare products that do not improve their complexion. While many individuals assume that professional skincare treatments are more significant than daily maintenance, external factors account for only 30% of skin ageing. UV exposure, pollution, smoking, and nutrition are examples of extrinsic influences. Intrinsic ageing is a result of the body's general health and proclivity to develop specific skin disorders, and it is genetically determined. Consumers should utilise a broad-spectrum SPF when considering these aspects. When it comes to skin whitening, the Chinese were the first to find safe ways. They believed that radiant, healthy skin reflected inner happiness. After the American Medical Association published a research tying lead-based whitening cosmetics to possible lead poisoning, the FDA changed many of these practises in the United States. Other dangerous activities include the formation of calluses, acne, dandruff, dry skin, and skin cancer, in addition to whitening. When it comes to applying skin care products, it's critical to do it in the correct sequence. Depending on your skin type, the order in which you use the items will differ. After cleaning your skin, apply an exfoliating toner. If you're using an exfoliant, don't combine it with a moisturising toner. The exfoliating product will not absorb into the thinner one, and vice versa. The use of modern technologies to generate effective, natural solutions is one of the most recent advancements in the field of skincare. The new generation of retinoid-based cosmetics will assist consumers in selecting products that successfully target skin ageing indicators. Retinol-containing products are likely to become a mainstay in every skincare regimen due to their numerous benefits to customers. There are several alternatives available to address a variety of skin issues. You might not have expected it, but the results are amazing, and the future appears to be promising. Dry, oily, and mixed skin types are the most common. Many external elements, as well as the function of layers beneath the skin, influence its health. A recent food or drink ingestion, for example, may induce skin redness and irritation. This could indicate an internal problem that needs to be addressed. You can also get your skin examined by a dermatologist. Wash your face and remove any makeup before starting your skincare routine. This will make it easier for your skin to absorb the components in your skincare products. Following that, dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD, associate clinical professor at Yale School of Medicine, recommends washing your face with warm water. Always moisturise your face after your facial wash to keep it from drying out. To avoid dryness and irritation, use a moisturiser in addition to cleansing. Natural Skin Care Products Have Many Advantages Natural skin care products are made with plant-based, safe components and are frequently marketed as being environmentally friendly. Skin care products, on the other hand, may contain dangerous ingredients such as tiny amounts of poisonous pesticides and chemicals that are harmful to the environment. Despite this, natural skin care products can benefit the skin by supplying antioxidants and other helpful ingredients. They can also improve skin texture and brightness, as well as brighten the complexion, minimise wrinkles, and firm the skin significantly. Healthy skin care products must contain emollients and antioxidants. Emollients, like shea butter, coconut oil, or synthetically derived ones, such as mineral oil are waxy lubricants that are beneficial to the skin. They also include trace minerals and nutrients, as well as the ability to exfoliate dead skin cells, albeit continuous usage of this product is not recommended. Jojoba oil is an antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-hydrating oil derived from the jojoba plant. Vitamin E and flavonoids are among the bioactive chemicals found in coconut oil. It may work to stop cancer cells from growing and is good for dry, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. It offers several benefits for your skin, including anti-aging effects, despite its oily nature. Other substances including licorice and mulberry have been shown to minimise the appearance of spots and redness. Origins Plantidote contains maitake mushrooms, which may help to calm the skin. Feverfew, a sunflower-family herb, is an effective natural calming agent."
2,7 Easy Ways Tomatoes Can Benefit You Quickly,health-fitness," Are you having problems gaining the minerals in your diet that you need? Want to have peace of mind that you are getting all the essential minerals your body needs to stay healthy? Well, here are 7 easy ways tomatoes can quickly help. But first, a bit about the tomato plant. The Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), like the potato (Solanum tuberosum), is a fruit from the NIGHTSHADE family of plants that originate from South America. However, the DEADLY NIGHTSHADE (Solanum nigrum) is an EXTREMELY POISONOUS plant, and, therefore, its Solanum relatives, like the tomato plant, also carry toxicity – but not quite as much. Fortunately, tomato and potato plants carry their poisons in their GREEN parts, especially in the leaves and stems. Steroidal alkaloids like SOLANINE have atropine-like effects on the nervous system, but thankfully these are NOT present in edible potato tubers or tomato fruits. Botanically, tomatoes are FRUITS because they carry SEEDS. However, they are generally eaten and prepared like a VEGETABLE as they are not as sweet as sugar-laden fruits like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, oranges, and apples. 7 Health Benefits of Tomatoes Tomatoes are famous for being the primary dietary source of the powerful antioxidant LYCOPENE. Lycopene occurs mainly in RIPE tomato SKINS, so NEVER peel a tomato. The more REDDER the fruit, the MORE lycopene it holds. Beneficial lycopene is formed when tomato fruits RIPEN and turn from green to RED. Tomatoes are also high in POTASSIUM, VITAMIN C, B9, and K1. Just one tomato gives around a QUARTER of the recommended daily intake of Vitamin C. Potassium is beneficial for controlling blood pressure. At the same time, vitamin K1 is good for the bones and blood. Vitamin B9 (folate) is suitable for tissue growth, especially during pregnancy. The essential compounds in tomatoes are the RED and YELLOW colored antioxidants LYCOPENE and BETA CAROTENE, respectively. NARINGENIN is a flavonoid in tomato skin, and CHLOROGENIC ACID is an antioxidant linked with lowering blood pressure. Amazingly, tomato KETCHUP, JUICE, PASTE, and SAUCES are the RICHEST sources of lycopene in the poor Western diet. A standard amount supplies us with FOUR-FIFTHS of our dietary lycopene. So, who said that processed foods are always bad for you? Weight-for-weight, the levels of LYCOPENE in PROCESSED tomato products are often MUCH HIGHER than in the fresh fruit as there is less water in concentrated processed tomato products. However, BE AWARE of the ADDED SUGARS in tomato ketchup! It is still better to eat FRESH TOMATOES whenever possible because of the other tomato nutrients mentioned above. Tomatoes Boost Heart Health. Heart attacks and strokes are the MOST common cause of death in industrialized countries. A study in middle-aged men found that LOW blood levels of lycopene and beta-carotene INCREASED the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Clinical studies of tomato products show a PROTECTIVE EFFECT on blood vessels that could decrease blood clotting risk. Things to Know About Tomatoes Ripening tomatoes release ETHYLENE, C2H2. Commercially, tomatoes are harvested and transported while green and immature. They are then sprayed with ethylene gas to prevent flavor development. That is the SOURCE of tasteless tomatoes. The ripening of green tomatoes is accelerated by wrapping them in old newspapers and leaving them on the kitchen table for a few days. However, they should be checked daily for ripeness. Tomato Side Effects Tomato allergy is VERY RARE, but pollen fever sufferers tend to be more allergic. Supplementation with pure plant-derived minerals may benefit susceptible types that get reactions like itchy mouths, scratchy throats, latex allergies, or even swelling of the mouth or throat. All in all, tomatoes are juicy, full of antioxidants, and may help fight several maladies. They are high in lycopene and form part of a healthy diet. If you know what you are doing, the above will help you get and maintain the essential minerals your body needs from tomatoes. Your ultimate levels of minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants from tomatoes can be reached if you take note of the principles given in this article. Getting the proper mineral balance is not a pipe dream and has nothing to do with genetic makeup. Use the information here, and very soon, you will have confidence and satisfaction that you have the correct minerals, vitamins, antioxidants, and especially the lycopene your body needs from tomatoes."
3,Ikenga Ogbo on Careers in Public Health,health-fitness," The healthcare industry is booming across the board. While most people quickly think of surgeons and nurses, public health jobs are an often overlooked area of opportunity. Public health workers have the opportunity to make a lasting impact on communities, and there are quite a few different career paths in this profession, many of which involve working with government organizations. One of the great benefits of pursuing a career in public health is that many positions only require a bachelor's degree, so it's an excellent option for students who want to make a difference in a healthcare setting but might not be interested in attending medical school. Read below for some of the opportunities available for graduates with public health degrees! Education Many public health professionals work as health educators. Their role varies significantly depending on their context, but health educators generally invest in communities by educating people on healthy habits. Educators are needed in nonprofits, colleges, and even traditional healthcare facilities! This job often involves developing programs, distributing educational materials, and running educational campaigns. Occupational Health Especially in warehouse and manufacturing settings, employers need healthcare professionals to help guide policies and procedures to ensure employee safety. A career in occupational health and safety includes: Developing safety training programs Teaching accident protocols and safe equipment operation Ensuring fair treatment of employees Epidemiology Epidemiologists are crucial in situations like the COVID-19 pandemic! They research public health issues by studying patterns and seeking root causes of injuries or diseases. The epidemiology field is growing rapidly, and there are job openings in settings from small private industries to prominent organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This career usually requires a master's degree, and most epidemiologists specialize in a specific field. Social and Community Service Organizations that provide services to the public need to have healthcare professionals on staff to ensure programs are effective and follow regulations. Social and community service managers work with community service organizations to manage projects and direct health programs. They often work directly with the community and stakeholders to ensure programs are meeting needs. Biostatistics For people interested in science and statistics, a career in biostatistics is an excellent alternative to traditional medical research. Biostatisticians study data relationships in living things, such as between a mother and her child. This job often requires interpreting the data collected from medical studies."
4,Is There a Correlation Between the Gut and Eczema?,health-fitness," It is estimated that 31.6 million people in the United States suffer from some form of eczema, ranging from minor to severe. This itchy inflammation in the skin has become a plague for many, and patients left and right have had to accept that this condition will be with them for the entirety of their lives, no matter how many prescriptions or creams they try. However, individuals have been looking into the skin issue more closely as of late, some estimating that there might be a cure after all. While it is sometimes unknown why certain individuals are more susceptible to eczema than others, individuals have recently been studying their gut health in relation to this skin condition. Research has found this hunch to be a reality, as more individuals are beginning to see a correlation between their gut health and their eczema. Some individuals are saying they have healed their eczema completely while others are saying they’ve simply learned to manage it with dietary changes. This chronic skin condition can have such an impact on one’s life that individuals are more than willing to try natural remedies to heal themselves of this bother. While the journey to better gut health and eventual skin health may take some time, the results it can have on your everyday life are very promising. As other individuals suffering from eczema began to reconstruct their gut health, one area that stood out, in particular, was that of fermented food. Fermented foods have been shown to reduce the harsh effects of eczema in adulthood. These foods include natural yogurts, kombucha, apple cider vinegar and more. These more naturally-derived ingredients are known to introduce friendly bacteria to the gut, which in turn benefits the skin. On top of fermented foods, a balanced diet in favor of vegetables and high-fiber foods is also known to support the gut. Many individuals who have begun taking their gut health more seriously are seeing positive outcomes on their eczema journey. Their eczema may still flare up from time to time, depending on their continual diet, stress levels and other factors. But many have learned that the key to managing their eczema is to listen to their eczema. In the moments when eczema flares up, take note of what your diet has looked like as well as any other factors that are affecting you. The more in tune you are with your body, the better chances you’ll have of gaining control over the medical conditions you suffer from."

6,Why do I have skin tags popping up?,health-fitness," There are roughly 3 million individuals that will be diagnosed with skin tags in the United States today. This is something that is common, but when it occurs on your skin, you may be tempted to panic because it may appear to be an oddly placed solution. This is an issue that comes up from the skin, and can cause a great deal of cosmetic issue, but nothing more. It’s not cancerous, it’s not going to cause much issue in terms of pain, and will not cause you to much issue if you leave it alone. But it is something that can be cosmetic in nature, and therefore you will want to get it removed, right? Well, before you can get to that step, you may want to know why you have skin tags that are popping up, and why they keep coming up over time. Understanding What Skin Tags Are The first thing that you need to know is that these are not something that are going to cause bleeding, discharge, or any sort of pain. In fact, you are not going to end up dealing with much of an issue in most cases. People don’t often have to deal with a wide variety of symptoms associated with tags. However, that doesn’t mean that you should just let them pop up without retort. Root causes associated with skin tags start with friction. Whenever the skin rubs against itself, or has any form of irritation, a small amount of collagen is pushed into the dermis. That small push upwards will have a growth that looks like a zit or acne. However, there will be no head and it will not be easy to remove with normal means. You’ll need to focus on working on something that is going to help with removal with ease. Tags come up due to friction, but they are associated with certain medical issues. Some of the most common issues include diabetes, tight fitting clothing, detergent issues, and hormonal shifts. These are common, but they are not the only issues that could cause tags to form frequently. Removing Skin Tags For those that are looking to figure out how to remove skin tags, the first thing to do is seek out a root cause. For instance, if it’s due to tight clothing, a change in lifestyle could help. If it’s due to sickness, a doctor may be needed to help. However, in most instances, you could use self care to get these things taken care of overall. The most common options for removing skin tags is to look for options that you can apply topically. For instance, you could use acne medication. This is a medication that you can place topically on skin tags and watch them fall off in due time. Another option that you can use is essential oils. These are options that you can place on the tag and let the elements penetrate the dermis and eventually cause the options to fall away with ease. It’s something that doesn’t take a lot of work to see come through."
7,Are skin tags and stretch marks related?,health-fitness," Skin tags are small growths that come up from the skin and are not cancerous. Many people assume that growths are related to sexually transmitted diseases or something similar. The truth of the matter is simple, they are not. That’s right, they are not issues associated with cancer cells or even sexually transmitted. This is something that you’re going to see occur at any age, for a number of reasons. You may think that stretch marks and skin tags are related, and you may be right. In fact, there’s a correlation between the two, but not for the reasons that you may think. Consider a few notes in regard to this, and you’ll denote why this is so important to consider, before you try and remove them overall. What Exactly Are Skin Tags? First and foremost, you should know that skin tags are nothing to be afraid of. They are simple to find, and easy to remove, if you know what’s going on. Tags form when there’s an allergic reaction or a friction of the dermis. Whenever you feel skin rubbing against itself, your body may react and trigger a small growth. A small growth that looks like a wart or a zit is what you’ll see and feel along your skin. It’s not something that you are going to find to be difficult to manage, mind you. It’s a simple thing that you can deal with, and it’s not going to hurt. This occurs on the skin in places like the ears, neck, under breasts, under arms, and near the pubic region. Whenever there’s an area that wrinkles, folds, or rubs against itself, you’ll find an issue that could grow. What About Stretch Marks? Stretch marks are associated with rapid weight gain, and weight loss. Women, for instance, may get pregnant and see these. Men can also get stretch marks, and that’s due to weight gain, loss, and other issues. Whenever the body has skin that stretches, you’ll find these marks. But are they related to the skin tags that you may see? The short answer is simple, yes. But not always. The Correlation Between The Two The reason why these two are connected is because the body stretches and causes folds, wrinkles, and movement to occur. When that happens, your body is going to react with a push of collagen into the areas where this occurs. When that happens, you’ll get a small growth upwards from the dermis, and you’ll have the tag formed. Now, that doesn’t always happen, but it is something that you can find to be true. Removing Skin Tags If you have skin tags, you can get them removed. You could remove them with a simple element. For instance, you could use acne medication topically on the tag. You could also utilize hemorrhoid creams, and even astringents that you can find over the counter. In most instances, you can get tags removed. You just have to make sure that you don’t pull, cut, or try to scratch tags away."
8,Are skin tags and rash related?,health-fitness," Skin problems are something that millions of people will have to deal with at various stages of their lives. You will not be immune to dealing with this at one point or another. It’s something that can be benign in nature, or it could be due to irritation of the skin, or any number of reasons. Another skin issue that many people deal with on a regular basis is that of skin tags. These two options are not distinctly related, but they can be similar in nature. To determine if you’re dealing with this and it’s something that you will need help with, it’s imperative to understand a few notes about each item and how it works. You’ll find that there’s a specific issue that comes through with each option and some can be worse than others. What Is A Rash? The first thing that you should know is that rashes could be due to a number of things. Skin rash is an area of skin that has been irritated for any number of reasons. Rashes can come up with bumps, burning, itching, and red skin. It could be to viral issues, detergents that come on the skin, tight clothing, sun exposure, and other problems overall. You could find that there’s a number of options that you can pursue in this regard, to clean things up and to avoid dermatitis overall, but it’s not always connected to the same things. That’s why many go with over the counter creams to relief the itching and burning. However, it’s imperative to realize that some people may need medical attention for this issue. What Are Skin Tags? The next thing that you should know is that skin tags are associated with this in a minor way. If you have skin irritation, you could develop a rash and a skin tag. Tags are formed when skin has friction of any kind. When you have friction, you’ll find that the skin can cause a small push upwards from the skin, and could very well change the course of your treatment. Tags form due to small amounts of collagen coming up from the dermis whenever there’s irritation or skin rubbing against other skin. Are The Two Related? The short answer is no, but the long answer is that there could be a sequence of union. The reason why is because there are common skin issues that could cause a small growth to appear on the dermal tissue. These small layers could push up a growth and cause irritation, and if you were to scratch tags, you could cause more irritation and that will require you to get medical help. Removing Rash and Skin Tags At the end of the day, you’ll find that both options can require a bit of help. The main focus of removing these things can be attributed to topical solutions. You could use tea tree oil, acne mediation and other options for skin tags. For rashes, you could use a number of antibiotic creams that will help with reversing dermatitis overall. Either way, you’ll find that these things can be done with relative ease."
9,What are the best essential oils for skin tags removal?,health-fitness," Skin tags form up from the dermis in a lot of different ways. There are a lot of people that will have to deal with this, including upwards of 3 million individuals in the United States today. This is something that doesn’t hurt, will not cause much trouble, and will not force any major issue overall. You’re going to find that this is something that is going to be easy to work with, especially if you know what they are, and how you can get rid of them with essential oils. What Exactly Are Skin Tags? First and foremost, you should know what skin tags are. The first thing that you should know is that they are small growths that come up from the dermis. This is something that is harmless, non-cancerous, and something that is not going to cause an issue for the most part. It’s something that is simple to work with, especially when it comes to skin irritation. You see, tags are not like acne, they are not boils, and are not lesions. They will not bleed, they will not puss, and will not cause major problems. They simply are growths that come up from the dermis due to irritation, and elements that come with this. Tags are something that come up due to collagen pushes. Collagen rushes to areas that there is irritation in the dermis, and often due to friction. Whether you have tight clothing, an allergic reaction, or skin rubbing against itself in areas. This may come up on the ears, neck, under breasts, underarms, under the waistline, and around the pubic region. Removing Skin Tags With Essential Oils There are several different ways that you can remove skin tags. One of the most common is to work with essential oils. You’ll take oils and apply them on the tags upwards of 3 times a day. In a matter of weeks, you’ll find that the tag will fall off without incident. There will be no blemish, and no issue at all, they’ll just fall off in time. Now, which essential oils work well? The following will show you a few things as to which ones can work out. Tea Tree Oil The first option is that of a tea tree oil. It’s something that is antiseptic, and anti-inflammatory. It’s an easy to work with option that you can apply directly to the tag and it works within a short span of time. Oregano Oil This oil is a positive solution hat will help you work out the kinks of tags. Apply this to the tags directly 3 times a day, and it will be easy to get results. Lemon Oil Another highly powerful and potent solution is that of lemon oil. Lemon oil is powerful, can help with pulling out skin tags over time. It’s simple to use, and is powerful in small doses. Rosemary Oil Rosemary oil is a good option. It’s simple to work with, and it has antiseptic and anti-inflammatory elements. You apply this the same way that you would other options."
10,The Importance of Professionalism in Healthcare,health-fitness," Professionalism is important in any career, but it's especially vital for people working in healthcare. Healthcare professionals deal directly with the sensitive matter of people's health and wellbeing. A lack of professionalism can mean a lapse in proper privacy practices, disrespecting patients, and building a toxic environment. Read below to learn more about why practicing proper professionalism is crucial in healthcare settings. Puts Patients at Ease Health matters can be sensitive and anxiety-inducing for patients, no matter what healthcare discipline you might work in. Whether a person is anxious about a potential diagnosis or just experiencing some nerves about a routine exam, an unprofessional practitioner only increases the tension. Healthcare professionals must find the delicate balance between being friendly and empathetic enough to put patients at ease while maintaining the authority and professionalism needed to foster an appropriate patient relationship. Protects Patients' Privacy Patients trust their healthcare professionals with a lot of personal, private information. Healthcare workers must treat this responsibility with care. There are many laws and regulations in place to protect privacy rights, and it is essential to stay up-to-date on those matters and any unique office policies that might be in place. Avoid gossiping about patient situations to coworkers and store all records as required, so patients continue to trust you with their care. Promotes Collaborative and Respectful Culture In addition to encouraging patient trust, maintaining professionalism also affects the overall office environment. Establishing a reputation as a responsible and respectful worker will help foster positive coworker relationships, encourage peers to reach out for collaboration on projects and reduce petty workplace drama so that attention can remain focused on giving patients the best care possible. These are just a few reasons why being professional in healthcare is so important. Integrity, compassion, and excellence are key qualities of successful healthcare professionals, and focusing on professionalism will help exemplify these traits. Patients trust their healthcare providers with their care and deserve to be met with professionalism and empathy. It can be easy to get caught up in the day-to-day routines and challenging interactions, but it's vital to ensure professionalism is maintained regardless."
11,The Biggest Cause of Burnout and What You Can Do About It,health-fitness," Burnout is becoming a more commonly acknowledged symptom that the majority of the workforce will feel at some point in their careers. Whether short-term or long-term, burnout can have significant repercussions on one’s personal and professional life. With this attentiveness to burnout’s effects, an undeniable interest in where it originates from has also come. Countless health professionals have done studies into the causes of burnout, concluding that it is a result of being overworked, a loss of sleep, mounding tasks and worries, and little personal time, to name a few. However, one underlying cause sets this all into motion: a feeling of lack of control. How Does This Cause Burnout? When one doesn’t feel in control of their life, career, looming circumstances, and financial obligations, it can lead to immense stress. When not dealt with, this stress multiplies and weeds itself into other areas of your life that might not have had any association with the original cause of the tension. Over time, stress leads to emotional problems and can even cause physical health issues. Combining these symptoms can become too much for someone, leading to a severe case of burnout and a different feeling of a loss of control. Feeling like you have little power over yourself and your circumstances can lead to a loss of identity and cause you to do uncharacteristic things that lead to poor work performance, disagreeable relationships, and a loss of motivation. What Can People Do About This? Burnout can feel like a hopeless corner once you’ve been backed into it, but managing burnout begins with dealing with its leading cause: a feeling of loss of control. As you strive to leave burnout behind, you’ll need to focus on taking back the control that you felt you lost. Address your potential more effectively by looking at the areas you can regain control of. For instance, you may not be able to control your boss’s work tasks they give you, but you can voice your desires for growth and the type of work you’d like to achieve in the workplace. At the same time, you must listen to your burnout as a sign to do some personal reflection. Do you feel stuck in your current career, or will this be something you can work through at your present job? Sometimes, burnout can lead to exciting career changes, but it takes listening to your desires to implement these transitions. As you realize this, you’ll come to regain control of your path and disconnect from the effects of burnout."
12,What is Endovascular Surgery?,health-fitness," Each decade brings with it new innovations in a wide variety of industries, including healthcare. This ever-evolving landscape is an exciting topic for many, as new healthcare innovations present the opportunity for relatives and friends to recover from once-incurable conditions. Endovascular surgery is one of many innovative procedural techniques to treat such diagnoses. In a nutshell, this surgery encompasses the minimally invasive insertion of a catheter into the arteries or veins and can often be performed in outpatient facilities. Types of clinical problems that can be successfully managed with endovascular surgery include most cardiovascular disorders, carotid artery disease, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cancer of the liver, uterine fibroids, strokes and many other vascular-related disorders. What Are the Perks of Endovascular Surgery? When most people picture surgery, they imagine open surgery, which usually requires a patient to be put under general anesthesia since open surgery can be quite invasive. On the other hand, most endovascular surgery is much less invasive and can be done with sedation. It often has fewer risks, is better tolerated by patients, and is the preferred way to treat a number of diseases. Given that endovascular surgery is done through a small incision, the post-procedural recovery time is much quicker than open surgery with most patients going home the same day of their procedure. Patients typically will not require physical therapy or significant recovery time and potentially lost work as they would need following open surgery. Endovascular surgery is much less painful and does not usually require post-procedural narcotics which are often needed following open surgery. Because of the minimally invasive nature of endovascular surgery, usually requiring no stitches whatsoever, patients are much less likely to have wound complications or scarring after endovascular surgery. The quick recovery time, less pain, and low risk of complications give patients much greater peace of mind and a more rapid return to their normal lifestyle. What Are the Risks of Endovascular Surgery? All procedures carry some risk, and healthcare providers are obligated to counsel patients of any risks and alternatives associated with the planned medical procedure. While uncommon and unique to the particular procedure, endovascular surgery can cause complications such as infection, blocked blood flow, blood leakage around the vessel, stent fracturing, or restenosis. Always be sure to ask your physician about the potential risks of any planned procedure and whether the procedural benefits outweigh the risks. Is There Any Follow-Up Care? Although some basic outpatient procedures do not require any follow-up, your healthcare provider may schedule a virtual or in-person follow-up in the days or weeks following your surgery. Even with an uncomplicated recovery, your doctor should want to ensure you are recovering normally and have benefitted from the procedure."

Many of these remedies are actually available right in our own home or in our backyard. As a reminder, it is always best to consult with a doctor or a specialist before trying out a remedy. If known allergies to any of the following food or food products, it is best to avoid them. Yogurt. Yogurt, a food that contains a lot of probiotics or ""good or friendly"" bacteria which are actually good for digestion. It is best to choose yogurt containing live bacteria such as lactobacillus or bifidus strain. To aid with constipation, add a teaspoon of mineral oil on the yogurt before consumption thus decreasing the occurrence of hemorrhoids or entirely preventing it to form.

17,How to sit when you have hemorrhoids?,health-fitness," We sit all the time. Be it on your days off or at work, we always sit. Unless of course you work as a salesperson on shopping malls or you’re a human statue on theme parks, most people, sit. On a normal day, a person sits an average of 7.7 hours, long enough to put pressure on the plump muscles that we have on our behind. On our offices, relaxing at coffee shops, picnic at the park, during meetings, conferences, when we eat our meals, read our books or even when we are passing stool. Maintaining a sitting position for hours can be very uncomfortable. Now imagine yourself with aching, throbbing, itching and worse, bleeding hemorrhoids on your behind and you have to sit for hours? Hemorrhoids or sometimes called piles, is a condition on which small veins located on the walls of the rectum and anus becomes swollen and bulge. This condition is commonly caused by constant pressure on the veins by straining when you pass stool. This is further aggravated by poor diet, constipation or diarrhea, improper lifting of heavy objects, pregnancy, being overweight or obese, poor posture and well you guessed it, prolonged sitting. Medical professionals advise that when you absolutely have to sit the whole day, take a break every hour to stretch, stroll for a few minutes or to just stand up. Aside from preventing a whole lot of other medical condition, the risk of hemorrhoid formation will also lessen. But what if, you already have them and your job requires you to sit in front of a computer the whole day? Well, it’s easy. Although none of the following sitting methods will treat hemorrhoids, these will surely help in decreasing the pressure you put on your buttocks thus lessening the pain and making it easier for you to go through out your day. Same if you’re still hemorrhoid-free, try to sneak in 5-10 minutes (as your schedule permits) of stretching, walking and standing. Again, this would decrease the pressure on your hemorrhoids. These are types of pillow with a hole in the middle made to relieve pressure on your anus. The difference between a donut cushion and hemorrhoid pillow is that hemorrhoid pillow maintains and holds its shape even after hours of use. Most available donut cushion are inflatable and thus easy to bring when traveling. If for some reason option number 2 is not available, a regular cushioned chair would be fine. Although would not effectively relieve pressure on your hemorrhoids, it would, at some level provide comfort compared to a regular chair. To aid bowel movement effectively and decrease the time spent in the toilet, elevate your feet on a step stool. It will change the position of the rectum and anus allowing easier passage of the stool. If possible, do not spend too much time sitting on the toilet as it puts too much pressure on the veins located on your rectum and anal wall. All this, together with consulting with a doctor, increasing dietary fiber, drinking a lot of water, maintaining a good posture and exercising, would help make hemorrhoid-associated pain tolerable and before you knew it, you’re pain-free and hemorrhoid-free."
18,Should the sitz bath (hip bath) water be hot or cold? What is the best temperature for hemorrhoid treatment?,health-fitness," There are a lot of natural home remedies for hemorrhoids. One of the most famous is sitz bath. Sitz bath or hip bath is a type of bathing method in which a person sits on a large basin or a tub with cool or warm water up to the hips. Originally a European custom of bathing, it is now widely used for therapeutic purposes such as relief from hemorrhoids or anal fissure, treatment for vaginal yeast infection or candidiasis, constipation and incontinence among other conditions. Despite its popularity however, most people do not know how and what to prepare for a sitz bath when one has hemorrhoids. Remember that other conditions require special preparations. Should my water be warm or cool? Do I need to sit for an hour? Do I need to put salt, aroma or baking soda on the basin? Do I need to do this once a week? Preparing and doing a sitz bath is generally easy. Just remember the following: Prepare a plastic sitz bath purchased at most drug stores, or if not available, a large enough basin or a regular bath tub. Ensure that the basin that will be used is large enough that a person can fit in and the water can be filled up to the level of the hips otherwise the therapeutic effect of the bath on the hemorrhoids and the pain will not be as efficient. Warm water (although some prefer alternating cool water after a warm sitz bath, cool or cold water is still optional). Although there is no standard temperature for a sitz bath, the water should be warm enough to provide relief but not too hot that it can burn. The effects of the warm water include reduction of the swelling of the hemorrhoids, regulating the blood flow and relaxing the muscles and skin on the buttocks area. During the 10-15 minute period of the bath, water will naturally cool down therefore it will help that there is a continuous flow of warm water. Again, as desired, cool or cold water can be alternated. Materials for entertainment such as books, crossword puzzles, music devices or a mobile phone. Since doing the sitz bath might take a while, it would be helpful to provide some entertainment to occupy your mind away from the pain caused by the hemorrhoids. Just make sure that the entertainment of choice does not need to use electricity. Remember, water and electricity does not work well together. Drying towels. After 10 or 15 minutes, if time permits, air-dry the hip and buttocks area. If luxury of time is scarce, then drying towel can be used. Remember that sitz bath don’t have to take too long. In some instance when sitz bath is done for 20 minutes or so, some experience dizziness and/or palpitation. Do the sitz bath, two to three times a week to provide optimum relief with pain caused by the hemorrhoids. If preferred and not contraindicated, essence or aroma, salt, baking powder and oil can be used. Although no scientific evidence says it helps with relieving hemorrhoids, if it can make the experience much relaxing, then these additional things can be used as well. Sitz bath no matter how much relief it provides is not a treatment for hemorrhoids. It is best to consult with the doctor if condition worsens."
