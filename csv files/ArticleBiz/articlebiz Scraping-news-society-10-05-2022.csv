0,A Question for Moderate Republicans,news-society," I have been voting for a very long time. Sometimes democrats won and sometimes republicans won. The issues that we voted on then were simple. Republicans voted for fiscal responsibility and lower taxes and democrats voted to improve social conditions for their own families and for the families of all Americans at risk.  Both parties were sincere in their opinions about what was best for the country. America’s strength was about working on compromises to find the best solution that both parties could agree on. Recently the Republican Party has changed. It is now about gaining power and putting into effect their own values and their own opinions on all issues by any means that they can, even when a majority of the voters may not agree with them. Many long-time republicans and also recent moderate republicans are becoming concerned about the direction their party is taking.  Moderate republicans love our democracy just as democrats and independents do, and don’t want to lose the rights we have all fought so hard to win for all of our citizens. They don't really want to vote for the authoritarian leaders their party is backing. They don’t like the campaign of hate and disinformation that their party is using to win at any cost. The question now for more moderate republicans in our country is what will they do with their vote in the coming elections? Moderate republicans are now faced with a difficult decision. If they don’t feel that they can vote either republican or democratic then their only option would be not to vote at all in the next few elections until their party again becomes the strong and valued party that they have always loved and remembered from the past. Will moderate Republicans choose to do the right thing that they feel will save our democracy or will they do the expedient thing and vote with a party that they know is on a wrong and dangerous path? That is the challenging question that many moderate republicans are asking themselves now? The answer to that difficult question has yet to be determined."
1,Fake News,news-society," Fake News We hear a great deal these days about misinformation, disinformation, and fake news.  It is leading some people to question the first amendment guarantee on freedom of expression.  This is understandable; after all, it’s only a small step from hate crimes to hate speech.  The above mentioned terms are difficult to define, however, I can think of some concrete historical examples which may give us some insight into understanding the larger concepts.  Let’s start with Ukraine in the 1930’s. Upton Sinclair, a famous progressive writer in the early part of the 20th Century, visited Russia in the 1920’s.  Upon his return to the United States, he stated, “I have seen the future, and it works.”  Sinclair may have been honestly duped, but Walter Duranty knew better.  Duranty was a writer for the famed New York Times who was sent to Russia in 1922 and stayed until 1936.  What we knew about what was happening in Russia during those years, we got from Duranty.  First, let’s take a look at a few facts.  There was a massive famine in the early 1930’s, mainly in Ukraine but also in Russia itself.  There is general agreement that the horrors were brought on by the policies of communist dictator Joseph Stalin.  Three to four million died of starvation in Ukraine and two to three million in Russia.  It was so bad in Ukraine that cannibalism was a common occurrence.  According to the reporting of Duranty, everything was fine.  He absolutely denied there was any problem whatsoever.  His articles, more or less, maintained that there is nothing to see here.  To make matter worse, he heaped scorn on another reporter who had directly witnessed what was taking place.  To add insult to injury, Duranty received a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 during the height of the famine. Herbert Matthews, another Times reporter, did a Duranty imitation of his own in 1957 when he interviewed guerilla leader Fidel Castro of Cuba.  In his article Matthews portrayed Castro in the best possible light.  He said Castro had a massive army, the majority of the people were on his side, and he was not a communist.  He went so far as to say that Castro was actually an anti-Communist.  After Castro took over Cuba in 1959, Matthews continued to proclaim the noncommunist nature of the new government.  He was still holding to this position into 1960 when Castro himself put an end to the nonsense by coming out of the closet and declaring himself a proud communist. Many people alive today remember the energy crisis of the 1970’s.  It was a time of gas shortages, long lines at the pump, and surging prices.  To conserve energy President Nixon instituted day light savings time the year around (it only lasted one year) and set the speed limit at 55.  President Carter told Americans to shiver in the winter and sweat profusely in the summer.  Looking back, it seems fairly obvious that the problem was instability in the Middle East and government control over the price of oil.  However, we were told by the government, the media, and academia that the world was running out of oil.  I personally bought in to this line of reasoning; it seemed entirely logical.  Demand for oil across the board was through the roof, and there is a limited amount of fossil fuel.  I remember a conversation I had with a friend during the 70’s in which I stated that oil was running out.  She said, “There’s plenty of oil!”  I thought she sounded ignorant, but I was the one who was uninformed.  It’s been almost 50 since that conversation, and we still have plenty of oil.  Regardless of how one feels about climate change and other related issues regarding fossil fuels, we were not running out of oil in the 1970’s. George W. Bush, for whatever reason, was determined to get rid of Saddam Hussein in 2003.  At first the government through Vice President Dick Cheney tried to tie Hussein to Al Qaeda.  That didn’t work; there was simply no evidence.  Then, they fell back on weapons of mass destruction.  Bush and the CIA claimed that Iraq had chemical weapons and was pursuing a nuclear capability.  The intellectual community was convinced, and the rest is history.  There was no investigative reporting on the part of the media as they bought the argument hook, line, and sinker.  Of course, it was all a lie.  The only thing relating to weapons of mass destruction the U. S. Army found when it invaded Iraq was a mobile lab which contained a few high school type solutions and materials. There is and always has been an abundance of fake news.  It’s the public’s job to sort things out, and it usually can.  We most always say, “Hey that sounds silly.”  The problem comes in when the fake news is supported by the media and the government.  When that happens, it can have catastrophic consequences."
2,Politics at Trinity High School,news-society," Politics at Trinity High School Those who know me realize I am a very conservative person politically.  When I attended a teacher In-Service after being hired by Trinity High School in 1985 at age 39, I realized I was entering a liberal environment.  A couple of my new colleagues were talking about how horrible the South African government was.  Shortly afterwards in teacher conferences, the principal (Sr. Stephanie Warren) subjected us to some women’s liberation theories.  Some revolved around spouse abuse and how it was caused by a patriarchal society.  Others concerned language and its sexist nature.  I talked to my dad about these developments, and he advised me to go about my job and keep my mouth shut.  Since I needed the job, I decided to take his advice. In looking back, Sr. Stephanie was in many ways ahead of her time.  In 1985, most of her beliefs were considered off the rails; now, they are the norm.  She was also very much an advocate of the nuclear freeze movement.  The year before, when she was just a teacher, she went to the Trinity Board and asked it to take a stand on this issue.  Tom Isbill, one of the Board members, told her to come back when the Soviet Union no longer posed a threat. Anthony Scola was the assistant principal at Trinity.  Anthony was what one might call an old hippie with an effeminate personality and a keen sense of humor.  He was also an intellectual type who could be very aggressive.  You didn’t want to disagree with Anthony; he could cut you down to size in no time flat.  He was a former priest who in his younger years had opposed the war in Vietnam.  Eventually he left the priesthood and the Catholic Church altogether.  He married a former nun (Margaret) who also left the church, and they both became Quakers.  The simple and pacifist lifestyle of the Brotherhood appealed to their sense of right and wrong. Margaret taught at St. Mary’s, one of the grade schools connected to Trinity.  She was also an old hippie who supposedly went so far as refusing to shave her legs or under her arms.  Originally the Scolas were from Milwaukee, but they wanted to get away from the fast paced urban life.  When they were hired to teach at Trinity and St. Mary’s in Whitesville, Kentucky; the town was too big for them so they settled in Deanefield, a smaller community to the southeast.  Whitesville contains about 600 people while Deanefield has less than 100. I discovered there was a divide between the administrators and clergy of Trinity on the one hand and the parents and students on the others.  In 1988 the Evansville Bosse basketball team, mostly Black, traveled to face a mostly White Heritage Hills team.  There had been a history of bad blood between the two schools.  On their journey, the Bosse team noticed burning crosses along the side of the highway.  Sr. Stephanie and some of her fellow sisters who taught at Trinity expressed horror over the situation.  Later I overheard some Trinity parents laughing and hee-hawing about the same incident. Sr. Stephanie left Trinity after four years as principal.  Despite my disagreement with her ideology, I had no problem with her as a person or a superior.  She gave me a job when I needed one, promoted me to athletic director after just one year, and always treated me with respect.  Several times she went to bat for me in disciplinary and personality clash situations.  Her replacement was Dan Fuller, a well traveled school administrator who came to Trinity from Florida.  At first glance he appeared to be more of the same.  In a document he submitted to the Board explaining his philosophy, he used feminine pronouns to refer to non-gender antecedents. Dan was a unique individual.  The students loved him and he commanded their respect.  They called him ‘Dan the Man.’  From an academic standpoint, he and W. A. Franklin (an Ohio County assistant principal) were the most scholarly and well read administrators with whom I have ever been associated.  However, he gave the students an inordinate amount of freedom, and after one year the teachers were a bit upset.  On her principal evaluation form, one teacher included the statement, “Less ‘Dan the Man’ and more Mr. Fuller.”  Some concerned teachers led by Anthony Scola and Sr. Lorraine Lauter (a religion instructor) tried to have Dan fired.  When the attempt failed, Anthony took a one year sabbatical at the University of Kentucky in order to work on a degree in Spanish. During Dan’s first year, Sr. Dianna Ortiz (a friend of Sr. Lorraine) claimed she was kidnapped, tortured, and raped by America’s allies in Guatemala.  Sr. Lorraine arranged for the school to have a special assembly to address the issue.  She turned the assembly into an America bashing session in which United States foreign policy was depicted as evil and sinister.  I sat in the back, and as the negativity toward the United States became intense, I shook my head in disbelief and disgust.  At one point I looked over at Dan who was sitting across from me, and he was cracking up with laughter at my response.  I interpreted this as meaning I had a friend and ally.  It turned out that I was correct because next year he promoted me to dean of students. Margaret Scola, Anthony’s wife, got involved in a running debate with a grade school colleague over the Gulf War of 1991.  She said we needed to give sanctions more time before going to war.  Jamie Clark, her colleague, challenged her by saying, “I can’t think of a worse way to die than starving.”  When Anthony returned from his sabbatical, Dan saddled him with the worst possible classes; they were chock full of troublemakers.  Anthony challenged the scheduling, but the Board upheld Dan.  A few years later, Anthony and Margaret resigned to become African missionaries.  They were stationed in Sudan, and I feared for their safety.  Nothing bad happened; however, as they both attended a Trinity graduation in the mid-90’s.  Also leaving were Sr. Lorraine and Sr. Theresa Henry (another liberation theology advocate).  With these departures, liberalism at Trinity pretty much ceased to exist. Shortly after his third year began, Dan himself resigned to take a principal’s position in Maine.  As chief disciplinarian I basically had the run of the school for the remainder of the year.  Another teacher (Katie Williams) was appointed interim principal, but she gave me the freedom to operate as I saw fit.  In 1992 John Calhoun was hired as principal.  He was a Ross Perot type of conservative, and we were off to the races. There was a bit of backsliding in 2000 when Mike Clark became principal.  Even though Mike was liberal, he did not make a point of advancing a political agenda.  However, one of his hires as a religion teacher did.  One day I noticed a document in my mailbox which was full of propaganda about how military spending was ruining America.  When I complained to the secretary about such items being placed in our personal spaces, she told me it was done by Bob Nicodemus, the religion instructor.  I then confronted Bob, and we became involved in a ferocious argument.  He defended the propaganda and his actions by comparing it to sending a Christmas card.  The argument went on and on, and we ended up yelling at each other.  Anyway, Bob left after one year, and Mike was gone as principal after two.  Afterwards, we returned to normal. It is appropriate in light of current tendencies that I end with a story about the national anthem.  In 1992 Trinity’s girls’ basketball team was playing in a Christmas Tournament at Brescia University.  As athletic director I was always looking to schedule our teams in such tournaments.  Barry McArdle, a public relations and recruitment specialist at Brescia, organized the event; and we played in it for a couple of years.  Shortly before our first game in the 1992 tournament, Barry came to me and said they would not be playing the national anthem.  Instead, a Brescia student would sing “God Bless America.”  He said, “After all, Larry, the national anthem glorifies violence.”  He then asked if what they were doing was okay with me.  I simply responded, “It’s your tournament!”  A short time later, a young Brescia student came to the scorers’ table visibly upset.  She said Mr. McArdle had just ordered her to sing both “God Bless America” and the national anthem even though she had not practiced the “Star Spangled Banner.”  This was probably my most satisfying point in the political wars at Trinity High School."
3,RESTORATIVE JUSTICE: How They Do It at Stateville Correctional Center,news-society," While the ""tough on crime"" perspective is still a hot issue in debates around the world today, restorative justice is without a doubt an aspect of the criminal justice system. This concept operates under the assumption that while prison cells serve as houses of punishment, they also serve as institutions of constructive corrections with the interest of transformation and growth for law offenders. At present, a trend that prison managements have adopted is to engage their inmates in simple industrial work. While most correctional centers have limited skill training of their inmates to basket-weaving, carving, and the like, the Stateville Correctional Center went as far as providing a barber's license to 15 inmates last November 2015. The Stateville Correctional Center (SCC) is one of the institutions under the Illinois Department of Corrections. It is a maximum security state prison for males. At present, the SCC has an estimate of 3,500 inmates with an annual budget of $32,000 per prisoner. It is also rated as a Level 1 facility, which is the highest designation out of the 8 security level designations. Rightfully so, such recognition seems well deserved after it spearheaded a barber's licensing program. The program was initiated by Illinois Governor Evelyn Sanguinettui, Bobby Mattison, and Director John Baldwin. According to its management, the program is an avenue for the inmates to be licensed while they are still within the walls of the SCC. It aims to prepare them for their reconnection to the outside world. The program also ascertains that landing a job will be easier for them right after they serve their sentence. Lastly, although it can be conceded that these prisoners are not yet free, such program is a very huge step in that direction. The said program also operates under certain mechanics. First, an inmate must undergo 1500 hours of training inside the Stateville Correctional Center before he can be a recipient of a diploma and a barber's license. Second, since most of the inmates in the SCC are still in the process of serving long sentences, the graduates of the said program are going to be assigned to other Illinois correctional centers. Third, the graduates will be barbers for other prisoners in the correctional centers that they will be stationed in. Aside from giving out diplomas, another uplifting gesture that the SCC's management did was to choose some inmates from the graduating class to give speeches during the ceremony. Indeed, family and friends who witnessed the ceremony were touched by the inspiring speeches that the graduates gave. All of the graduates believe that this unique program helps them remember their worth. It makes them believe that they have something to offer, and that they also have skills. While there isn't a universal concurrence yet of how much restorative justice should be in a criminal justice system, it is to be pointed out that the Barbers of Stateville have found a new meaning to prison life. They might still be behind bars but they know that they aren't unproductive. Regardless of whatever it is that composes the CJS, the CJS must never undermine its long term goal to create better citizens. While restorative justice is not yet widely celebrated, it has interests that must always be protected.  Undeniably, the Stateville Correctional Center is in the right path in that direction."
4,How to Survive Solitary Confinement in Prison?,news-society," Surviving prison is hard enough for most people. What more if you are held in solitary confinement for the rest of your prison sentence? Do you have any idea how to survive solitary confinement in prison? Man is a social being. He is made to exist in a community or society where he is expected to connect to others in his surroundings, even when in prison. It can be expected therefore that people who are solitarily confined for a long period will experience a bout of mental problems such as paranoia, anxiety, depression, panic and aggression. Being housed separately from the rest of the prison population, with scarce or no human contact at all except for the guards who silently deliver your meals or take you outside of your cell (to another open but still enclosed area) for that daily one hour respite from confinement is simply torture. People who have experienced solitary confinement for long periods of time can attest that it will mentally affect you, if you are not careful. Being deprived of any human contact in a SHU (Solitary housing unit), which usually does not have windows, just solid wall of cement in all corners, can drive you nuts. Suicide rate amongst these types of prisoners is quite high. Moreover, people who have pre-existing mental conditions may experience debilitating symptoms that may cause them to have difficulties re-entering society after the incarceration. Solitary confinements are used by prison system to penalize offenders. The room or area where you will be confined is very cramped, dark and smelly most of the time. I think it is the prison system’s way of breaking down a convict, to make him think about what he has done in his life or what he had committed that lead him to prison. If you don’t know how to survive solitary confinement in prison, you will end up broken and lost in the end, unable to re-enter society as a rational, sane human being. Here are a few things that will help you on how to survive solitary confinement in prison, should you ever be sent to one. Exercise. Most solitary housing units or rooms are cramped, dark, windowless and small. However, you can still perform some basic exercises to strengthen your muscles and bones. Exercise will also help you attain physical good health and sound mind. Do not let the limited space hinder you from maintaining your physical form. Meditate. Learning how to meditate can help you be at peace with yourself and with the world around you, regardless of your situation and location. When boredom strikes, as it will often do, turn to meditation to help you free your mind of negative thoughts that can lead you to depression, panic and paranoia. You should realize that the power to make a heaven out of hell is in your hands. Read and write. You won’t get to have television or radio when you are in solitary confinement. However, you can ask your friends and relatives to send you some books and magazines to while away the time. If you are not yet into writing, start writing. Jot down your thoughts, feelings and whatever comes to mind during your confinement. It may be the only outlet you will ever have, so make the most out of it. Do some self-enhancing activities such as learning to write books, articles or do things with the use of your hands. You may be able to put these skills later when you re-enter society."
5,How to Survive Prison as a Sex Offender?,news-society," As much as everyone is at risk when in prison, there are certain groups of people who are more in danger than others. Sex offenders, especially child molesters are among the most harmful prisoners due to the nature of their offense. Stories about abuse (physical and verbal) received by these offenders from fellow prisoners abound. That is why if you belong to this group of prisoner, you must know how to survive prison as a sex offender. If you are a convicted child molester and your fellow prisoners know about it, you will probably be the object of physical abuse (being physically knocked around), as well as sexual and verbal abuse. How to survive prison as a sex offender depends on your attitude and how you conduct yourself while being incarcerated. Many prisoners (as much as many of them are hardened convicts who perpetrated various crimes) are not fond of people who molest children and rapes women. Many child molesters and rapists have been sodomized and sexually assaulted by fellow prisoners, to get across their feelings of rage for the crime committed by such offenders; hence, it would be best to lie low and not get on the nerves of your fellow prisoners, and the guards if you don’t want to catch their attention.  Getting unwarranted attention by being loud or snitching, can make fellow prisoners interested in you. They will likely inquire about your crimes and that is not good for you. It is better for others to speculate on your crimes than be really sure about your offense. By keeping to yourself and being respectful of others, you will less likely earn the ire of other prisoners. Even if you hear and see things around you, say nothing of it to others, especially the guards. People will see this as snitching, an act which also belongs to the likes of sexual offenders. Paramount to learning various ways on how to survive prison as a sex offender is having the right attitude, when in prison. Do not shout at people or call them names. Avoid being boisterous as it can only attract negative people. Say “thank you “or “excuse me” when you have to and avoid hanging out with prisoners who are always looking for trouble. Don’t show you are too hard or well-above the rest of the lot. People will hate you for it. This especially holds true if they learn that you are a sex offender. However, learn not to come on as weak either or else people will push you around and pounce on you. Strike a balanced personality that makes people think twice before making a move against you. Choose your friends. You may be amongst convicts but you can find friends whom you can trust, no matter how impossible it may sound. They are still human beings who have done something wrong and who may have already realized their wrongs and is already on their way towards renewing themselves for the better. Be honest to these people whom you call friends and admit your offense. They may feel differently at first but when they can tell that you are truly remorseful about what you have done, they will help protect you from would-be abusers in prison."

7,Discover Easy Ways on How To Survive As A White Guy In Jail,news-society," There are many false assumptions about how to survive as a white guy in jail. These assumptions were formed due to speculations that black men are more dangerous than white guys in jail. The truth is both can be as dangerous as the other. Every person is defined by his personal character, and not by his race, breed, or color. You only have a few things to follow in order to survive in jail. Find A Good Lawyer Every suspect or convict has the right to find his own lawyer. If you did not commit a violent crime, a good lawyer can argue your case so you will most likely end up in a minimum-security prison where the inmates are not as violent. With a good lawyer, you will be able to protect your rights even if you are considered as a criminal in this country. Keep Some Cash Before you go inside the prison, make sure to bring some cash with you. Inside the prison, you can’t always what you need for free. You need to pay for your own essentials. If you want to live as normal as possible, bring some cash with you inside the prison so you can buy some things that you might need during your stay there. On Books Prisons often have their own libraries, so you should try to find out where it is because you will be spending a lot of your time there.

Be wise in choosing friends. You cannot trust anyone easily. Hang out with people who steer clear of trouble. Don’t be Racist The fastest way for a white man to get seriously hurt in prison is by being racist against the other inmates. Even if you’re just joking, racist remarks can rub people the wrong way. If you to live amicably with the other prisoners, learn to think before you open your mouth. Try your best not to make any enemies while you are inside and you will be just fine."
8,Can a Relationship Survive a Prison Sentence?,news-society," If you are married or in a serious relationship when you get incarcerated, you may have apprehensions whether your relationship can survive the ordeal of being apart for a long time. There have been numerous relationships broken and wrecked apart because one of the two parties is in prison. Reasons for the break-up vary, starting from the fact that maintaining a long distance relationship is hard enough. Complicate that with having to maintain a relationship with a convict, which has an attached stigma in our society. One cannot also discredit the reason why the person is sent to prison. Of course, it can be quite hard to maintain a relationship with someone who is convicted of multiple murders, sexual offense or child molestation. However, the question remains: can a relationship survive a prison sentence? Whether you will agree or not, a relationship can actually survive despite incarceration. Of course, this depends on some factors. For instance, if you have just dated the guy for a month and then he gets incarcerated, you probably won’t last long unless you are so madly in love with each other that you are willing to work on it, despite the situation. On the other hand, couples who had been living together for two to three years can possibly survive for another two years apart. Having already invested time and emotions on the relationship for a long period of time can make a person hold on and wait until the other partner comes back from prison. Of course, it will not be easy but if you are willing to work on it, your relationship will survive whether the sentence requires just a few months to five years in prison. It is important to note that people in relationships who have successfully hurdled the challenges of incarceration did not make it just by doing nothing. How can a relationship survive a prison sentence if one or both parties are not willing to make a go for it? You should realize that it takes two to tango. Patience – The party who is left outside has the means and the time to get involved with another while their partner or spouse is serving prison term. If one does not have the patience to wait for the other, then the relationship will definitely not survive. It takes patience and a lot of imagination to entertain and engage in activities that will enhance yourself, instead of trying to find a replacement (temporary or not) for the incarcerated partner. It could get lonely to be live on your own (especially if you don’t have kids), without a bedmate, someone to do things with or cuddle to when you’re cold. Infidelity or unfaithfulness is often the primary cause of break-up when one is in prison. Determination – It can be hard to have the determination to stay loyal, true, faithful to the person you love when he is spending time away from you in prison. The tenacity to hold on even amidst the toughest of times is something that people in relationships are experts in. If you are the kind of person who quickly surrenders after some minor setbacks and challenges, then you cannot expect to last long in the relationship arena. Forgiveness – Depending on the seriousness of the crime, forgiveness is one of the things that can help people sustain relationships. Can a relationship survive a prison sentence? This is greatly dependent on the parties involve. If they work hard on keeping it and if they really love one another, they will surely hurdle the challenges."
9,Explaining Civil Litigation,news-society," Lawyers can build their careers across various fields, from family lawyers to corporate attornies. One common field of practice is civil litigation. Civil litigation attorneys work with cases with no criminal charges or penalties. Instead, civil litigation attorneys work with various kinds of non-criminal legal disputes in which plaintiffs are looking for some sort of compensation or damages. Read on to learn more about what it means to work as a civil litigator! What Kinds of Cases Do Litigators Handle? As mentioned above, civil litigators handle non-criminal legal disputes. This encompasses many different kinds of cases, so most lawyers working in civil litigation have just a couple of areas of expertise. Civil litigation cases might include landlord and tenant disputes, personal injury claims, intellectual property disputes, medical malpractice claims, education law disputes, and more. Unlike in criminal cases, where the prosecution has to present evidence that proves their case beyond a reasonable doubt, civil litigation trials only require convincing evidence. What Skills Do Litigators Need? Civil litigation requires similar skills as other areas of law. Litigators need to have extensive knowledge of local and federal laws related to their area of practice, strong communication skills, negotiation skills, and more. Negotiation can be critical in litigation cases. Many litigation cases never go to trial, so negotiating terms to resolve the issue outside of the courtroom is a crucial skill. What Are the Steps to a Litigation Case? When a client hires a litigator for their case, the case goes through a particular process, just as in any legal procedure. When a potential client wants to pursue civil litigation against another party, their first step is to meet with a litigation attorney to discuss the case. The attorney will help explain the process and evaluate whether or not the client has a strong case. From there, if the client decides to proceed with the case, the attorney will do extensive research to build evidence. This will be followed by both involved parties filing pleadings, essentially explaining their sides of the issue. Once the court has received both pleadings, the case will enter the discovery stage. This is essentially an extension of the research phase, including witness interviews and fact gathering for each side to build their case. The discovery stage usually takes the most time. Once discovery is complete, the case enters pre-trial, which is the last step for many cases. In pre-trial, the attorneys for both the plaintiff and defendant begin negotiations, trying to reach an acceptable settlement outside of court. If an agreement cannot be reached, the trial will go to court, and a judge will decide the matter."
10,There is a problem with Ukraine,news-society," There is a problem with Ukraine There is something going on in Ukraine which is just not as it appears.  Sophistication, complexity, and intrigue are the three best words to describe this beleaguered country.  To begin, there are essentially four main forces that are driving events in the nation.  They all compete with one another and have different agendas but have been drawn together to present a united front. First and foremost are foreign NGO’s and American foreign policy operatives.  Their goal is to make Ukraine a liberal democracy that will eventually achieve integration into NATO and the European Union.  These people are extremely efficient, and they have outflanked their opponents both in Ukraine and the outside world.  They effectively brought about two Revolutions, the Orange (2005) and the Maidan (2014).  At this point in time, they have established the narrative which a vast majority of the American public accept as fact. A few examples are worth noting.  Victoria Nuland was the State Department employee tasked with the overall implementation of American’s Ukraine policy.  During the Maidan Revolution, she was caught on tape organizing a new government and arranging who would be placed in key positions.  Most on the ideological spectrum agree that corruption in Ukraine has been a persistent problem.  Marie Yovanovitch, U. S. Ambassador to Ukraine from 2016-19, told Ukrainian officials who they could and could not investigate for corruption.  Vice President Joe Biden was the point man for Ukraine in the Obama Administration.  He threatened to withhold one billion dollars in aid if Ukraine did not fire a prosecutor who was investigating certain entities.  One important target under investigation was Burisma, a company that employed Biden’s son.  Alexander Vindman was a U. S. military and intelligence figure active in Ukraine.  He was so involved in security arrangements in the country that he was offered a leadership position in its armed forces. Since 2015 the government of Ukraine has been controlled by those who believe in liberal democracy.  They make up force number two and are totally dependent on the first force in order to win support from the outside world.  They’re not much different from the political elites in the United States which is to say they believe in democracy and Capitalism.  They maintain the absolute sovereignty of the people to decide their own fate irrespective of their big and powerful neighbor (Russia), and they make no concessions on territorial integrity.  All this would be fine if the country were in Western Europe, had a historically unified populous and culture, or a border that had a centuries old definition. Force number three is the oligarchs.  This group is made up of wealthy businessmen who, of course, have close ties to the first two.  Their economic power gives them leverage over the political process.  In the United States we call them billionaires.  Like Donald Trump before he was President, they have to hedge their bets by supporting those in positions of political power or those likely to be at some point.  Much of the corruption that is prevalent in Ukraine revolves around the oligarchs.  Because of their intricate connections in the government and among foreign operatives, it is difficult for the legal system to do much about their power, influence, and corruption. The fourth force is made up of fascists or Nazis.  It makes up the shock troops for the other groups.  During the Maidan Revolution, they carried the day by organizing protests, demonstrations, and violence.  They have a military force called the Azov battalion.  The battalion began as a private militia but was later incorporated into the Ukrainian army.  They are the ones who have been on the front lines in fierce fighting against Russian separatists in Eastern Ukraine.  It has been reported, I might add, that they have received military training from the United States.  A political party was organized by their leaders after 2015, but it received little to no support from the electorate. One might ask why the fascists would support liberal democracy.  Don’t they have more in common with Moscow than Kiev?  The answer is they can only exist in a democracy.  While democratic leaders deplore their ideology, they allow them to continue for three reasons:  they are beholden to them for support given during the Maidan Revolution, they depend on them to do the heavy fighting in Eastern Ukraine, and the ideal of democracy that all beliefs, however toxic, have the right to be expressed.  This third reason goes back to Voltaire, the great French philosopher, who stated that tolerance extends to those who believe in intolerance.  Putin, on the other hand, would have no tolerance for the Azov adherents.  He would purge them to the last man, and they know it. So what does all this have to do with American politics?  Well, actually, quite a lot!  In 2016 Donald Trump ran for President and began voicing skepticism about America fighting needless and endless wars abroad.  For Ukraine this did not look good.  To make matters worse, he hired Paul Manafort as his campaign director.  Manafort had previously worked in Ukraine as a campaign advisor for the President who was deposed in the Maidan Revolution.  At this point, Alexandra Chalupa enters the story.  Chalupa is the daughter of Ukrainian-American immigrants.  She is referred to by Wikipedia as a pro-Ukrainian activist and has worked at various times for the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.  She made it her goal to expose Manafort and thus paint the Trump campaign as a tool of Putin and Russia.  In her effort to do this, she worked with the Ukrainian government, the American Embassy in Ukraine, and allies in the United States Congress.  The project achieved some success as Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign when his Ukrainian contacts were publicly revealed. During the 2016 Presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee’s computer and the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign director, were hacked.  The contents were posted on various news sites including Wikileaks where it gained a widespread audience.  Needless to say, the material was very embarrassing to party leaders, the mainstream media, and Hillary.  Contrary to popular belief, the Committee’s computer server was not turned over to the FBI to determine the origin of the hack.  It was instead analyzed by CrowdStrike, a private cyber security firm.  Crowdstrike, not the intelligence agencies of the U. S. government, concluded that Russia was responsible for the hack. A co-founder and chief officer of CrowdStrike was Dmitri Alperovitch.  Alperovitch is a Russian who came to the United States in 1994 and later became an American citizen.  He has an intense dislike of Vladimir Putin and is a member of the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank and one of the NGO’s referred to in an earlier paragraph.  The Council makes no secret of its intent to promote liberal democracy in Ukraine and make the country a full fledged member of NATO.  One of the Ukrainian oligarchs is a significant donor to the Atlantic Council as is CrowdStrike. As is common knowledge, President Trump’s first impeachment revolved around Ukraine.  Alexander Vindman, Marie Yavonavitch and many career state department employees became star witnesses for the prosecution.  They thought Trump was blackmailing Ukraine into investigating Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son who was heavily invested in Burisma (a Ukrainian energy company), and also CrowdStrike.  Trump had apparently bought into the idea promoted by many conservatives that the Democratic server had been relocated to Ukraine.  Putin may have lent credence to this idea as he supposedly told Trump that Ukraine was behind the theories advanced in the Steele Dossier that Russia was actively involved in helping Trump in the campaign of 2016. It is worth noting that Ukraine did start an investigation of Hunter Biden and Burisma after Trump was acquitted of the impeachment charges by the Senate.  After Joe Biden was elected President, however, the inquiry was dropped.  I guess this could all be justified as hedging your bets. Ukraine is now involved in a vicious war with Russia.  Ukraine may be the underdog in this fight, but it has many forces at its disposal.  The Ukrainian army is roughly equal in size to the invading Russian force, it has received drones from the West, the Trump and Biden Administrations have provided it with javelins (anti-tank weapons) and stinger missiles (anti-aircraft weapons), and its forces have received advanced military training from the West.  Whatever one may think about the two countries and its leaders, it is clear that Ukraine has important friends in high places and has decisively won the propaganda battle in the United States.  Public opinion more or less paints Ukraine as saintly and Russia as demonic.  The only other times I have seen such unanimity of opinion were after the Kennedy assassination, during the Watergate scandal, and following the events of 9/11.  And yet, I maintain based on the information presented in this article that there is a problem with Ukraine!"
11,Cyberwar History and Ukraine,news-society," People are much more drawn to images of blown-up building, fires, mushroom clouds, refugees in dire circumstances, color pictures of pain that are better in black and white than they are to explanations of code or even fallout from code if it’s not resulting in something blown-up, fiery, or pictures of people in pain that are better in black and white. That is to say, while we see plenty of stories of ransomware, temporary business disruptions, and credit card & ID fraud, it’s not visceral. It goes by quickly on the page and in our minds. So, whatever happened to the stories we saw before the cyberattack age? When the US Cybercommand was  just a twinkle in some geeky eyes? What happened to the discussion that cyberattacks would engender kinetic responses? Bombs not electrons. Perhaps it was a sense of proportion. Perhaps it was a recognition that we consider that an increasing cyberwar, if responded to with bullets, might just result in use seeing those images of things that would be better in black and white on our own doorstep? Did we back off, or did sanity take hold in the minds of the planners? Let’s look at a little history. Back in 2003, a cyberattack originating from China - and christened, “Titan Rain,” by the US - managed to get access to loads of sensitive government information by compromising the systems of US government contractors and of government systems themselves. Only unclassified information was stolen, but the world woke up to this kind of attack. In 2004, the Joint Chiefs of Staff declared cyberspace an important domain of conflict alongside the air, land, sea, and space domains. No doubt, this was prompted by the reality of Titan Rain. As a culture, we were just starting to think about these things on a national level. In 2007, Estonia experienced a broad cyberattack that included their parliament, banks, and media. It was believed to have originated from Russia, or from Russian actors. NATO’s response was to create the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) in 2007. Now, continents were beginning to wake to the threat and the need to do something about it. The Tailinn Manual The CCDCOE began to develop an extensive study and code about what how international law applies to cyber conflicts and cyberwarfare; these previous acts were beginning to be recognized as acts of war. Calling on legal scholars and legal practitioners that were experienced in cyber issues, the CCDCOE produced Tailinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare in 2012. The Tailinn Manual declared that killing hackers in response to certain cyberattacks was justifiable. Killing hackers?! Meanwhile, other state-sponsored cyberattacks marched their way into the public consciousness. The Stuxnet Worm was developed to sabotage Iran’s nuclear development efforts – in particular, the centrifuges used to enrich uranium gas. It is believed to be the first malware designed to and succeeding in visiting physical destruction on physical equipment. Wired Magazine called it the first digital weapon. It's widely considered that the US and Israel collaborated over a period of 5 years to develop this malware. In 2009, Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, recognizing how important AND vulnerable important computers and networks were (are), directed the creation of USCYBERCOM. It is the unified command for the cyberspace domain in the US and the world. In 2016, the organization described the 2016 espionage ops against the Democratic National Committee while in the midst of a national election “serious business . . . [that] may destroy democracy.” Administration officials at the time considered that cyber weapons were so potentially destructive that they should be unleashed only on the direct orders of the Commander in Chief, like nuclear weapons. I do not know if there is an equivalent “Cyber Football.” Article 51 of the UN Charter allows individual countries to defend themselves and to band together to defend each other. It also allows the same if an armed attack is anticipated and recognizes the right to use force in such a situation. It allows cyberattacks to be considered an armed attack. In 2019, Israel did just this, by conducing airstrikes on a building that they said had Hamas members inside that were planning to launch a cyberattack on Israel. In 2021 the topic was up for noticeable public discussion again. NATO heads of state and government met at NATO’s North Atlantic Council meeting in Brussels and issued a communiqué that ultimately equates cyberattacks with kinetic attacks and leaves the possibility of military action against hackers on the table. Still, what we generally see is that cyberattacks - or anticipated cyberattacks - by states are dealt with by preemptive and after-the-fact punishing cyberattacks. Tit for tat, as it were, and even before the tat. Cyberwar in Action What we have seen in practice in Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014 and in Ukraine in 2021 is the “softening up” cyberattack. The attack used to diminish and disable defensive and living systems before a kinetic attack, rather than a kinetic attack in response to a cyberattack. Many said that the 2014-2015 cyberattacks were on a an entirely different – and grander – level than had been seen previously. Several Ukrainian banks and government agencies became inaccessible and malware – using a tool called “HermeticWiper” - was wiping data from hundreds of PCs and servers. But we’ve gotten used to common DDOS attacks, data-wiping and ransomware in recent years on the civilian level. It’s kind of taken for granted that these things are ongoing and all over. The use of cyberwar and kinetic war together has been labeled “hybrid warfare.” And yet, the world seems surprised that Russian cyberattacks on Ukraine in 2021 and 2022have been substantially less severe than anticipated. To be sure, they were and are ongoingly widespread. Hackers caused the Viasat satellites to become inoperative. But that may have affected Russian soldiers and commanders to lose connectivity as well. And said attack has been mitigated somewhat by the Musk’s activation of Starlink Internet satellites over Ukraine. Additionally, Ukrainian modems were zombie-fied by Russian malware, being used as nodes for targeted DDOD attacks within Ukraine. But the ruination from malware that was expected has not really seemed to occur. We haven't seen a cyber-Armageddon. Were they more pr? Were the US and/or the EU pumping up Ukraine’s cyber defenses or attacking the offensive cyber capabilities of Russia? The newspapers wonder about this and government sources overtly express surprise and confusion that there isn’t more cyber damage. I would be willing to wager that they know more about this than they are letting on. But then, isn’t that almost always the case? The coming days and weeks will tell us more about cyberwar in Ukraine. It’s possible that all-out disruption of Ukraine’s Internet will come to pass. We hope not. But one thing about this history stands out. We have not seen the kinetic response to cyberattacks on a wide scale that was being discussed a decade ago. Luck? Cooler heads? Invisible cyber counterattacks? Thoughts of a Cyber version the Mutually Assured Destruction doctrine that has, in theory, kept the world from launching nuclear war? Or is physical destruction on a massive scale enough to satisfy those bent on domination? These times we’re living in will surely shape the times we will be living in. Let us hope and work for that cyberwar doesn’t exceed the malign effects we have seen to date and that going forward we see fewer dire images because of fewer dire circumstances"
12,Can Caspian Gas Help EU Diversify Supply?,news-society," Yes, it can but it will take time. Expanding Caspian natural gas pipeline supply can greatly benefit EU’s energy security in the 2030-time horizon and beyond. As an immediate measure, the EU has focused on increasing access to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). However, in the medium and long-term, priority should be given to developing new natural gas pipelines from the Caspian. EU has recently recognized that it needs to reduce dependence on Russian gas. In addition to geopolitical considerations, there is a strong economic rationale for why the EU needs to proactively diversify natural gas supply. There is a high degree of market concentration, with three suppliers responsible for over 80% of natural gas imports to EU in 2021. Such a high degree of concentration exposes EU consumers to a greater likelihood of supplier strategic behavior and disruptions as well as increases probability that the market will be underserved. Non-Russian countries of the Caspian basin and Central Asia have about a quarter of the world’s natural gas reserves. Tapping into new Caspian gas is more cost-competitive compared to new LNG sources. In fact, natural gas production cost modeling commissioned by the UK Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy identified development of new gas pipelines from the Caspian as one of the most cost-competitive options for the European market. A Veritas Global study on the economics of natural gas supply diversification estimates that EU consumers would have seen lower wholesale gas prices by 24% in 2021, had the European market secured better access to Caspian gas. This could have saved EU consumers between €24 billion to €48 billion in 2021. These benefits could be realized by implementing the White Stream project, which would bring Caspian gas to EU. This shovel ready project was put on the backburner due to misplaced concerns over climate change and a lack of political will. Reviving this strategic project today would meaningfully contribute to improving European energy security in the 2030-time horizon and beyond. A well-functioning and competitive natural gas market also supports the green transition in two important ways. First, it offers an immediate opportunity for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Burning natural gas instead of coal produces roughly half the carbon dioxide emissions to generate the same amount of energy. Second, natural gas offers a flexible and reliable source of balancing capacity to manage fluctuations in energy supply, which enables achieving a higher penetration rate of renewable energy. Except for nuclear power, electricity generated through natural gas currently offers the most viable and low-carbon alternative to coal-based power as a solution for intermittency. Over the long-term, renewable hydrogen has the potential to become a substitute to natural gas. However, even if the EU hydrogen strategy is fully implemented, only modest quantities of renewable hydrogen are expected to be available over the next two to three decades. Therefore, better access to Caspian gas is an essential complement to EU’s hydrogen strategy and key to supply diversification. Crucially, burning natural gas can be compatible with EU’s net carbon neutrality targets. Several options exist for neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas use. Options include deploying carbon capture and storage technology, purchasing international offsets, and using direct air carbon capture processes. While all options offer technically viable solutions, the progress achieved in recent years in direct air carbon capture processes has the potential to generate near endless opportunities for emission reductions at a reasonable cost. Therefore, tapping into more Caspian gas is a solution that strengthens EU’s energy security and can be fully compatible with net carbon neutrality targets."
13,Does Russia have monopoly power in European natural gas markets?,news-society," Yes, Russia already has some monopoly powers, and its position is like to strengthen further. Analysis by Veritas Global shows that Russia is likely to already have monopoly power across several EU markets. For 11 of the 27 EU members, Russian natural gas consisted of over 60% of all imports. For 7 of the 27 EU members, Russian natural gas was over 90% of all imports. EU-wide, Russian market share of natural gas imports increased from 17% in 2006 to about 35% in 2020. Russia’s position has strengthened further through its recent investments in additional pipeline capacity. Some have argued that the increasing share of sales of Russian natural gas in Europe will create a dependency of Russia on the EU. However, this narrative is not supported by economic theory. To have countervailing power, consumers need to be able to have credible options for switching at short notice to other suppliers of natural gas or use product substitutes to natural gas from non-Russian sources. The high cost of switching to alternative options partly explains the upward price volatility observed across many EU gas markets in recent months. In the short-to-medium term, European consumers, especially in countries that are highly dependent on Russian natural gas, do not have alternative economically viable substitutes. The combination of a high market share and excess transit capacity will magnify Russia’s dominant position in natural gas markets across Europe. Therefore, in the absence of an effective European supply diversification strategy, we think monopoly power is likely to further accumulate to the Russian supplier. These developments could have far-reaching implications that go beyond the functioning of energy markets. For example, one concern might be that Russia may use its leverage to influence political outcomes, for example over decisions taken at the European Council. Since many of the decisions taken by the Council are done either through unanimity or consensus, Russia may be able to exercise leverage over states that are highly dependent on Russian gas thereby giving Russia the ability to hold sway over some Council decisions."
