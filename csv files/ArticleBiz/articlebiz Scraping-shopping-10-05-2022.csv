2,Affordable Jewelry To Gift Your Lady Love,shopping," We've all heard that a little sparkle goes a long way when it comes to wooing your girl. Especially, if she wasn't anticipating the dazzling gift in the first place. What we mean is that everyone, including you, gives jewelry as a gift on important occasions such as Valentine's Day or an anniversary. As a result, the entire endeavor becomes predictable, and the element of surprise gets removed from this equation of love. But if you offer her a beautiful jewelry gift on a random day of the year to show your appreciation, it will make her feel extra loved and special. She will understand that you are not just buying her something because the occasion calls for it. But because you value her presence in your life. So heed our advice and buy her something incredible like a pair of Dakota silver huggies and give it to her on a day when she will be least expecting it. Maybe after a tough work week? The huggies will surely cheer her up, and make the moment memorable for years to come. Now, you may be wondering, ""Do I really want to spend money on fine jewelry when it isn't even a special celebration?"" Here's a little secret: You don't need to spend a fortune to showcase your adoration. You can easily buy fashion jewelry that looks as good as fine jewelry. And to be honest, jewelry is jewelry, regardless of the type. Here Is Our Affordable Jewelry List Just for You! Both hoops and huggies are great alternatives to the same old studs. And they make a great addition to the jewelry collection because they serve two distinct functions. Huggies contribute to a simple style with a touch of shine, whereas hoops function as a dramatic statement piece.

We recommend stainless steel pieces with 14k gold plating, just like the 14k gold hoops. The thickness of the plating determines the piece's durability. So, better plating means a sturdier chain. Additionally, she'll appreciate that you thought about the quality of your gift, and it will be the perfect alternative if you don't want to buy something made out of pure gold. Since the gift is not for any special occasion like an anniversary or engagement, you don't have to buy anything like eternity or solitaire rings. Instead, go for a stackable ring set that compliments her style! And right now meaningful motif rings are all the rage. So you can get a handful of these, and she can use them to make her own unique ring stacks. Just so you know dainty, motif rings go really well with the design of the Dakota silver huggies. So you might as well put that one in the cart along with the rings. Conclusion No matter when and why jewelry is always effective as a thoughtful gift.

They are precious silver metals and generally, people get in the dilemma of selecting between pure silver and 925 sterling silver. We are here to get your all doubts clear. What is 925 Sterling Silver? Sterling silver is an alloy made of pure silver metal and other elements. This exclusive metal is available in earthly metals and considered a precious metal. During the earlier days, silver metal was used to make ornaments and silver coins. Later the metalsmith faced some problems in making pure silver jewelry. Therefore, with research and development, the 925 Sterling Silver was discovered. The 925 Sterling Silver is quite affordable and easy to create with multiple design options. With the advent of technology, the 925 Sterling Silver became popular in jewelry niches. So, the alloy contains around 92.5 % of silver alloy and the rest of the metal options like copper. The alloy mixture gives certain durability and a sparkling shine over regular silver metals. Therefore, it can also be the best Valentine's Day Jewelry. Now we will discuss why Sterling Silver is so famous and here below are the reasons for it. Silver purely is a malleable metal when it mixes with the alloy of copper and tin. Therefore, at one end it provides more durability to the wearer. In this range, you can have various types of metals all together like necklaces, rings, and bracelets. Even the sterling silver is not 100 % pure but the lustrous appearance makes it feel expensive and valuable. Furthermore, if you use it in as much water or for daily purposes, the sparkle of the metal will not vanish easily. The pure silver metal is more expensive than sterling alloy that includes all the above costs of initial designs and the making charges of the artisans. Whereas, sterling silver is an affordable metal that reduces the price of the final product significantly. Therefore, it becomes an excellent choice for gifting purposes. Metals usually undergo tarnishing which is a chemical reaction that makes the metal appear dull and dark. This darkened layer comes with an exposure of metal in the air that contains sulfur gas. Therefore, it results in loss of shine. Pure silver is not that reactive metal and does not get tarnish when it comes to exposure to water and air. On the other side, sterling silver needs a bit of care and protection from air exposure as it might lead to dulling of the metal. Is giving Sterling Silver a good idea on Valentines' Day? Valentine's Day gifts for her are available in magnificent numbers in the market. If you are someone who is looking for cute, dainty, and affordable jewelry for your lady love then Sterling Silver is the best option. Indeed, on Valentines' Day, you can plan to give rings, bracelets, necklaces, etc. Here, we hope after reading the article you got an idea about sterling silver jewelry and how they are different from pure silver metal.
