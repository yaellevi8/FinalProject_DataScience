0,Greatest Basketball Game I Ever Witnessed,sports-recreations," GREATEST BASKETBALL GAME I EVER WITNESSED The most memorable and exciting basketball game I have ever witnessed took place at the Owensboro Sportscenter on Friday, December 14, 1962.  The contestants were Rexi Mundi (Evansville) and Owensboro High School.  Rexi Mundi came into the game undefeated and ranked number one in Indiana while Owensboro was also undefeated and ranked number two in Kentucky. It was the first year of racial integration in Owensboro, and everybody was wondering what affect it would have on the basketball team.  The player most people were talking about was 6-3 senior Charles Taylor who had been a starter at Owensboro Western, the segregated Black school, since his freshman year.  Two Rex Mundi players were also receiving high profile attention.  One was 6-8 Tom Neimeir who would later go on to star at Evansville College.  The other was Bob Griese.  Yes, it was the same Bob Griese who would become a two time All-American quarterback at Purdue University and a legend with the Miami Dolphins.  Ten years after the Owensboro game, he would be a part of the last undefeated NFL team. At the end of the first half, Owensboro had a 13 point lead.  Rex Mundi came out roaring in the third quarter and got within two at the end of the frame.  With time running down at the end of the fourth quarter, Neimeir hit a 15 foot jumper to send the game into overtime.  The first overtime was rather uneventful, and the score was still tied at its end.  At the end of the second overtime with Owensboro trailing by two points, Taylor shot a last second twisting 30 foot jumper that banked in. With three seconds to go in the third overtime and the score tied, Owensboro had the ball but had to go the full court.  The ball was passed in to Bobby Woodward, an Owensboro guard, who flipped it to Taylor.  Taylor was standing on the right of the free throw line at the opposite end of the court.  He dipped the ball to his ankles and heaved a two hand set shot---nothing but net!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  One interesting side note, back then teams normally did not press full court.  Taylor was unguarded when he took the shot.  He ended the game with 39 points, Neimeir scored 28, and Griese had 14. And now, to the rest of the story!  Owensboro would go on to win the Third Region and advance to the State Tournament.  They won two games in the State with the second against high regarded Princeton Dodson, a segregated all Black school.  One of Dodson’s players was Dwight Smith who would go on to star with Clem Haskins at Western Kentucky University.  Smith was projected to go high in the NBA draft, but before it took place, he drowned in a tragic automobile accident.   In that State Tournament game, however, Smith was totally outplayed by Taylor who outscored him 26-14. Taylor attended Kentucky Wesleyan College and had a fantastic freshman year as he teamed with Mike Redd.  Redd was Kentucky’s 1963 Mr. Basketball and led Louisville Seneca to the State Championship.  At the end of his freshman year, Redd was removed from the team for disciplinary reasons.  Taylor continued playing into his sophomore year but was declared academically ineligible midway through the season. I would later have limited contact with two players in the Rex Mundi-Owensboro game.  George Moore was a 6-4 power forward who had attended Owensboro Western with Taylor.  In the Rex Mundi game he came off the bench to score 4 points.  As the season progressed, he became a starter and by the end of the year, was Owensboro’s second leading scorer. In 1966, I attended the Kentucky Young Republican convention in Louisville.  The faction that I supported put George’s name in nomination for sergeant-at-arms.  We both rode back to Owensboro with a few other guys who had attended the convention.  When they let him out in Owensboro’s West-end, I got out of the car to shake his hand and say goodbye.  The others began yelling; “Larry, get in the car—get in the car!”  They were spooked by the West-end.  George graduated from Kentucky State University, earned a PhD in chemistry, and is a member of the Owensboro High School Hall of Achievement. Grant “Gi Gi” Talbott was a teammate of Taylor and Moore at Owensboro Western.  He did not play in the Rex Mundi game but was a member of the squad.  Midway through the season, he became one of Owensboro’s starting guards.  Grant later became the head coach of Owensboro’s girls’ basketball team.  He also served on the Board of Control for the Kentucky High School Athletic Association.  I met him when I was athletic director at Trinity High School.  My contact with him was not extensive, but it was meaningful.  I learned he had a very outgoing and pleasant personality.  He was the type of person who never met a stranger, and when he talked to you, it was as if he had known you for years.  He loved to talk about old times and engage in sports’ trivia. These are my reflections on the greatest basketball game I ever witnessed.  I hope you enjoyed it."
1,Rupp and Race,sports-recreations," Rupp & Race A lot has been made over the years about the alleged racism of Adolph Rupp.  The media has made a big to do over the issue for many decades.  It has plagued Kentucky pretty much down to the present day.  The subject of this composition is not to prove or disprove those charges; it is to detail the largely futile attempts by Rupp to integrate the University of Kentucky basketball team. Rupp was first ordered by UK President John Oswald in the early 1960’s to recruit Black players.  One thing Rupp did not want to happen was to have a Black just for the sake of having one.  If the athlete happened to sit on the bench because he wasn’t good enough to see much action, it would make the entire program look bad.   There were some superstars who simply did not qualify because of academic reasons.  This is not to disparage Black intellect; it was simply a byproduct of Jim Crow education.  Still others were not recruited because they were incapable of handling the pressure of playing in places like Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. It would take a special type of person to be a trailblazer for Kentucky.  He would have to be someone who could play immediately, not flunk out, and be able to take the harassment and intimidation that would come his way. In 1964 Rupp set his sights on Westley Unseld of Louisville Seneca High School.  Unseld, however, became upset because Rupp did not take direct action in his recruitment.  He apparently expected the old coach to camp on his doorstep.  This was something Rupp rarely, if ever, did.  He left the direct visitation to his assistants.  Players wanted to go to Kentucky because of the aura of Adolph Rupp, not because he held their hands. Nevertheless, Rupp decided Unseld was important enough to pay a personal visit.  He arrived at the Unseld household and had a conversation with the player’s parents; the only problem was Unseld was not there.  By all accounts it was just a big mix-up, but Unseld felt he had been slighted.  Also, Mrs. Unseld was not satisfied with some of the answers Rupp gave to questions she posed.  What the questions and answers were, we do not know.  We just know she was a bit peeved.  Shortly after the visit, Unseld announced his intention to play for the University of Louisville. Next up was Butch Beard of Breckinridge County High School.  Beard had led his team to a runner-up finish to Unseld and Seneca in the 1964 State Tournament and to a championship the following year.  Once again Rupp made a personal visit to the recruit’s home, and once again the mother became upset over something the coach said or how he said it.  The Beard family was not convinced that Rupp could protect their son from abusive treatment when the team played games in the Deep South.  In addition, Beard said years later that he simply did not feel comfortable around Rupp.  After consulting with Unseld, a personal friend, Beard decided to cast his lot with the Louisville Cardinals. After suffering a defeat at the hands an all Black team from Texas Western in the finals of the 1966 NCAA Tournament, Kentucky made a concerted effort to sign Perry Wallace of Nashville.  Wallace checked all the boxes of what the Wildcats wanted and needed.  He was super talented, scholarly, articulate, and level headed.  Assistant coaches Harry Lancaster and Joe Hall made several visits to the Wallace home in Nashville.  Wallace said he very much liked both men and appreciated their interest.  However, he was disappointed because there was no visit from Rupp.  In the end he decided to stay home and play for the Vanderbilt Commodores. 1967 saw Kentucky intensify the search for its first Black player.  Bobby Watson, a starter on Kentucky’s 1951 team that captured a national championship, was the coach of Owensboro High School.  He more or less delivered Felix Thruston, his star player, to the Wildcats.  Everything was worked out behind the scenes, and an announcement was scheduled.  A day or so before the details were finalized, Thruston publicly stated he planned to attend Trinity University in San Antonio.  What happened?  To this day, no one knows!  In the same year, the Mayor of Hazard brought star player Jim Rose to Rupp’s office in Memorial Coliseum.  Rose pledged at that meeting that he would attend Kentucky.  After getting back to Hazard, however, he got cold feet and said he would play his college career at Western Kentucky University. There was one more possibility in 1967, Jim McDaniels of Allen County High School.  As far as talent was concerned, McDaniels was head and shoulders above the field.  At 6-11 he was a great inside player, but he was also agile and a good ball handler.  In addition, he could hit from all points on the floor.  He had a few problems with attitude and academics, but Kentucky was getting desperate.  McDaniels spent three days in Lexington visiting with players, touring the campus, and meeting with Rupp.  When the dust had settled, he decided to become a Western Kentucky Hilltopper and reportedly convinced Rose to do likewise.  McDaniels would later say he was disappointed that the Rupp meeting only lasted fifteen minutes.  There was an unconfirmed report that Western enticed the young star with a new car. Kentucky finally hit pay dirt in 1969 with Tom Payne of Louisville Shawnee.  Payne presented some difficulties for Rupp and the Wildcats.  His test scores were so low he did not qualify for a scholarship during his freshman year.  He had to pay his own way that year and did not play on the freshman team.  Also, he had to take special courses in order be eligible for a scholarship during his sophomore season.  Years later he supposedly said in a private conversation that others had taken the courses and tests for him. There is an interesting story told to me by T. L. Plain, a Kentucky assistant during Payne’s sophomore season.  First, let me relate a few things about Plain.  He first hit the big time by coaching Henderson City High School to a runner-up finish in the 1956 State Tournament.  When I was in high school, he was the head coach at Kentucky Wesleyan.  Later he got a doctorate degree and served as an assistant at both Louisville and Kentucky.  He left Kentucky after Payne’s only season there to become the head coach at Utah State.  Along the way he became best friends with Rupp’s successor, Joe B. Hall. After I retired, a referee friend (Billy Haynes) of mine invited me to attend a Rib barbecue at his home in Henderson.  It was a very enjoyable experience, and I attended several of these events as he had them on an annual basis.  It was there that I met T. L. Plain.  We struck up an instant friendship.  He related many stories of his coaching days, and he seemed impressed by my knowledge of sports trivia. Now, let’s get to the story Plain related.  One day Tom Payne exposed himself on the UK campus.  I suppose it was a “flashing” situation.  Plain and Hall heard what happened and decided they would have to tell Rupp.  When they went into Rupp’s office, they asked him how his day was going.  He said, “Not very damn good!  Some ‘nigger’ ran his car into the fence on my farm.”  At that point, Plain and Hall decided not to tell Rupp about the incident or at least wait until a better time. Before continuing about Payne’s days at Kentucky, let me briefly mention that I also met Steve Newton at the Rib Feast.  Newton was the coach at Murray State University when “Popeye” Jones played there.  He later became the head coach at South Carolina when Rick Pitino coached at Kentucky.  When I met Newton, Pitino was having rough sledding at Louisville.  I asked him what he thought of Pitino.  He said, “He’s a good guy; he’s a fighter; he’s like Trump, he’s from New York.” Payne played well at Kentucky during his only season there.  He got better and better as the year progressed.  Rupp stated he was pleased with the youngster and indicated he could become another Dan Issel.  The high point of Payne’s career at Kentucky was a 39 point performance against LSU late in the season.  The year ended on a sour note, however, as Kentucky lost 107-83 to Western in the NCAA Tournament.  Payne had 15 points in the game, but McDaniels pumped in 35 and Rose scored 25 for the Hilltoppers.  A few weeks after the game, Payne announced he was going to apply for an NBA hardship.  He was drafted by the Hawks and played one forgettable season in Atlanta.  Shortly after the season, he was arrested and convicted on a rape charge.  Being 7-2 and Black, he was easy to identify.  Since that time, he has spent much of his life in and out of prison on various criminal charges.  His most recent prison stint was at a federal detention facility in Muhlenberg County. As you can see Adolph Rupp did not have an easy time in his recruitment of Black players.  When he finally succeeded, it turned out to be disaster.  Beard and Unseld were convinced he did not truly want them.  They indicated it was not so much what he said as how he said it.  Whether or not Rupp recruited in good faith, only he knew.  More likely, the players he recruited simply did not want to a racial pioneer or trailblazer and deal all the baggage that came with it."
2,Calipari Needs To Go,sports-recreations," Calipari Needs To Go Editor’s note:  This article was written in March, 2021 The time has come for Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari to go.  I don’t say this based on his ability as a coach but on his betrayal of the spirit and essence of being a Kentucky fan.  This year was horrible from the standpoint of wins and losses; Kentucky had its worst season since 1927.  Nevertheless, it would be incomprehensible to fire a coach who has produced constant excellence for over 10 seasons because of one lousy year.  However, if you couple that year with a complete denial and contempt for the cultural standards of what the Kentucky basketball program for decades has meant, its time for Calipari to leave the building. In August, 2020 Kentucky players produced a video about Black Lives Matter.  The incentive for this was the martyrdom of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed by Louisville police in no knock drug raid, and George Floyd, a Black man killed by a Minneapolis policeman in an arrest gone bad over passing a counterfeit bill.  Black Lives Matter is a controversial and ambiguous concept.  The meaning is open to interpretation even though many of its leaders have proclaimed it to have a Marxist intent.  In the video the players more or less make the point that White society is racist to the core and it is their right and obligation to take a stand on this premise.  Afterwards, Coach Calipari said, “I stand with my players.”  He also wore a BLM t-shirt. About the same time a movement began among students and professors at the University of Kentucky to rename Rupp Arena.  Included among the group was Keion Brooks, a current Kentucky player.  Those involved claimed Adolph Rupp, the legendary coach at Kentucky from 1929-1972, was racist because he did not aggressively recruit Black players.  I will have more to say about Rupp and race in a future article.  Calipari again entered the fray by saying that he was going to listen to all sides of this issue and encouraged a conversation.  In our current environment, when someone says he wants a conversation, it means the issue is already settled in his mind.  It has evolved from debate to what action can we take. The straw that broke the camel’s back as far as I was concerned was the Kentucky players and coaches kneeling when the National Anthem was played.  This disrespectful action took place just before the Wildcats took on Florida at Florida.  It had been building up for awhile.  Prior to the Florida game, the players had been staying in the dressing room while the National Anthem was played before home games in Rupp Arena. Calipari defended the action.  He said it was not about the military because many of the players came from military families.  He said it was about recent events, implying it had to do with the January 6 “insurrection” at the capitol building in Washington, D. C.  That made no sense.  First, why protest an “insurrection” against the United States by protesting against the anthem of the United States?  Second, if the “insurrection” was the motivation, why had the players been staying in the dressing room before January 6? While being interviewed about the event, Calipari tried to have it both ways which is his usual mode of reasoning.  He said he personally put his hand over his heart as the anthem was played.  He did, but he also knelt and locked arms.  In August when he said he was all ears about renaming Rupp Arena, he said he was good friends with Rupp’s son and didn’t want to believe the racist charges.  Making a strong statement about something while keeping one’s foot on the other side of a line may go over when analyzing a basketball game, but it doesn’t cut it in matters of patriotism. In one sense, I can appreciate Calipari being in a difficult dilemma.  He has to rely on the best Black players the country has to offer while satisfying a virtually all White and fiercely patriotic fan base.  To add to his problems, he lost his main disciplinarian after last season.  Kenny Payne, his valuable assistant who kept things under control, left to become an assistant with the New York Knicks.  Discipline is extremely important in sports.  Players have to be trained to respond and to accept things as they are without questioning.  Otherwise you lose, and dissention sets in.  Payne was able to provide Calipari with the discipline he needed to have a well oiled winning machine. Arguing for a coach to be dismissed goes against my grain.  Usually I am a strong defender of the head coach.  There’s a lot of stress to the position from the fans and a great deal of backstabbing from assistants and wannabes.  Normally my position is you need to be patient and give a coach time to work through hard times.  This situation is different.  It’s not about winning, it’s about respect, patriotism, and heritage."
3,"Joe B. Hall, RIP",sports-recreations," Joe B. Hall (RIP) In many ways Joe B. Hall was the Rodney Dangerfield of college basketball.  During his reign at Kentucky, there was an often repeated joke:  “What do you get when you cross a groundhog with Joe B. Hall?--Six more weeks of bad basketball.”  Joking aside, Hall’s record speaks for itself:  one NIT title (1976) and three final four NCAA appearances of which one was a championship (1978) and another was a runner-up finish (1975).  Yet, he was constantly in hot water with the media and fans.  Much of it had to do with his personality.  He was to put it bluntly a boring nerd like figure who was consistently upstaged by other coaches.  He suffered greatly in comparisons with Bobby Knight, Dean Smith, Denny Crum, Digger Phelps, and Dale Brown who were more media savvy. Under Hall, Kentucky went from being an all White team to basically 60-75% Black.  The type of Black players he recruited didn’t really help his image, especially with the national sports writers.  They were what some commentators refer to as Black/White.  Their skin was dark, but they played and acted like Whites.  They did not play the in-your-face ghetto style but rather a disciplined and conservative brand.  A coat and tie was their fashion of dress as opposed to the sneaker and t-shirt.  When being interviewed, they were careful to be respectful and not say anything controversial.  Socially and politically they could be called ‘Uncle Toms.’ Louisville Coach Denny Crum was an ever present thorn in Hall’s side.  Crum recruited inner-city Blacks and gave them the freedom to operate as they pleased both on and off the court.  The contrast with Kentucky was obvious.  He also openly expressed a disdain for Kentucky and its players.  When Crum was hired by Louisville, Kentucky had landed the number one ranked player in Kentucky (Jimmy Dan Connor), Indiana (Mike Flynn), and Ohio (Kevin Grevey).  When asked by a reporter to compare the Kentucky recruits to those Crum had signed to UCLA during the Johnny Wooden era, he said there is no comparison.  He went on to point out that the UCLA group had won three national championships whereas the Kentucky players were yet to prove themselves. To add insult to injury, Crum often implied Kentucky was afraid to play Louisville in the regular season.  There was a continual drumbeat in the media to make such a game happen.  During the 70’s and early 80’s, Louisville had more final four appearances than Kentucky which Crum and the media regularly brought to everyone’s attention.  The two teams finally met in a 1983 elite eight game with the Cardinals winning by 12 in overtime.  Kentucky played well but just ran out of gas at the end.  Afterwards the UK Athletic Board voted to allow an annual contest between the two rivals.  The only ‘no’ vote was cast by former two term Kentucky Governor A. B. “Happy” Chandler who was serving as Board Chairman. Another coach who was a thorn in Hall’s side was Dale Brown of LSU.  Like Crum, Brown recruited inner city Blacks and directed a smash mouth style of basketball.  In 1974 it looked like Kenny Higgs of Owensboro was headed to Kentucky.  Owensboro had always been solid UK country; it is after all the home of two all time Kentucky greats, Cliff Hagan and Bobby Watson.  With Watson being Higgs high school coach, it seemed only natural for the youngster to cast his lot with the Wildcats.  However, Higgs did not fit the role as to the type of player Hall wanted.  He was looked upon as a rebel and possible trouble maker.  While Kentucky hesitated, Brown stepped in and quickly nabbed the all-stater. There was a game in 1976 which typified the type of relationship between the two schools and coaches.  It was played in Lexington, and LSU was coasting to a win with about ten minutes to go.  At that point Hall went to mid-court and had a conference with the officials which lasted close to five minutes.  After the meeting of the minds, call after call started going Kentucky’s way.  With about three minutes to go, it was clear that the game was going to end in a Kentucky victory.  Brown then went to mid-court, argued with the officials, took off his coat, and threw it onto the court.  Kentucky won by fourteen, but Higgs did have 32 points.  Brown and Higgs gained a measure of revenge in 1978 when they handed Kentucky one of only two losses the Wildcats suffered in their championship season. Bobby Knight of Indiana and Joe Hall were supposedly good friends who occasionally fished together.  Knight, however, made no bones about his dislike of Kentucky.  He accused Kentucky of cheating in the recruitment game and mistreating its players academically.  He also liked to make disparaging remarks about Kentucky’s legendary coach Adolph Rupp.  The media ate it up.  Everything came to a head in a 1974 game in Bloomington.  Indiana was running Kentucky off the court when Hall pulled his starters.  Knight did not reciprocate.  After the two coaches exchanged words, Knight hit Hall on the back of the head.  Hall had to be restrained by Jimmy Dan Connor, one of his players.  The friendship, if it ever existed, was gone forever.  Kentucky and Hall got even in an elite game of 1975 when it handed Indiana its only defeat of the season. Early in Hall’s career as head coach, he employed a physical defense and made frequent use of his bench players.  This strategy was a departure from how Rupp coached.  To Rupp, defense was something to be endured until you got the ball back, and it was not uncommon for him to use only five players for most of the game.  Kentucky’s defense under Hall was so fierce that Coach Digger Phelps of Notre Dame accused Kentucky of playing karate defense.  The use of bench players was something Hall may have copied from Dean Smith of North Carolina.  Smith would often go ten deep, and Hall did likewise. Any respect between the two coaches had for each other ended an elite eight game of 1977.  It was an intense game with North Carolina opening up a slight lead toward the end.  When the game was pretty much over, Kentucky center Rick Robey fouled out.  As Robey headed to the bench, Dean Smith confronted him and lashed out, “You SOB!!  All you know how to do is throw elbows!!”  Did this incident in any way mar Smith’s image with the media?  You better believe it did not!  Later, when Smith broke Rupp’s record for most wins, he was portrayed as a saint with a halo over his head while Rupp was characterized as an evil racist! Another strategy Hall got from Dean Smith was the “Twin Towers” concept.  Early in Smith’s career at North Carolina, he was known for having at least two exceptionally tall players on the front line.  Hall first employed this concept with Rick Robey (6-10) and Mike Phillips (6-10), and it led to the 1978 NCAA Championship.  A few years later, he tried it again with Sam Bowie (7-1) and Melvin Turpin (6-11).  Bowie and Turpin almost brought home another championship until disaster hit. The 1983-84 season, featuring Bowie and Turpin, was one where Kentucky soared to great heights only to crash to an inglorious ending.  For most of the season, Kentucky was ranked anywhere from number one or number three in the nation.  There were several close calls that ended well.  The most titillating one was a victory over Auburn in the finals of the SEC tournament.  Auburn was led by Charles Barkley who had made a career out of making Turpin look like a monkey despite being five inches shorter.  To say that the game was a grudge match would be putting it mildly.  With the score tied at 49, Kenny “Sky” Walker of Kentucky took a last second 15 foot jump shot which hit the front edge of the rim and bounced in.  After the game, Barkley sat under the basket and sobbed unabashedly. During that turbulent season, Hall guided the Cats to their last final four appearance of his tenure.  Their opponent was big, bad Georgetown led by Patrick Ewing.  Georgetown loved to slug it out on the court, and as former coach and commentator Al McGuire put it, “They’ll beat you as bad as they can.”  They did both in the game against Kentucky.  After leading throughout the first half, Kentucky hit a dry spell toward the end of the half.  Even though they were unable to capitalize, the Hoyas stole the ball several times and forced numerous turnovers.  One of the Hoya players blurted loudly, “We’re going to win this game.” A nightmare deluxe is the only way to describe the second half.  Kentucky did not score for the first 10 minutes and had only 11 points overall.  They shot 3-33, and no starter had a field goal.  When they weren’t turning the ball over, they were taking wild and crazy shots with no chance of going in.  To put it in simple terms, the Wildcats were intimidated in a devastating fashion.  You could actually see fear on the faces of Kentucky’s players.  I have never seen a team so dominated and scared of an opponent at that level of play. Hall coached another season after the Georgetown debacle, but that was it; he was done.  So, how does one evaluate Hall as a coach?  If you don’t count the Georgetown game, he comes across pretty well.  Perhaps his biggest mistake was to over inflate the ability of his players.  When they didn’t produce as expected, it made Hall look bad.  When Derek Hord signed to play for Kentucky, Hall described him as another Bernard King (the superstar from Tennessee who sent on to fame in the NBA).  Hord was a quality player, but he was no Bernard King.  After Kentucky won the 1978 championship, Hall signed three players he touted as sensational.  They were Dwight Anderson, Clarence Tillman, and Chuck Verderber.  I saw all three compete in a high school all star game prior to attending Kentucky and was not impressed.  Tillman was exceedingly slow and could not handle the ball, Anderson had to have the ball to be effective, and Verderber was essentially a mediocre player.  Tillman and Anderson eventually transferred to other schools after a short stint at Kentucky.  Verderber stayed around for four years and was a decent role player, but he was never sensational. A couple of other things that irked me about Coach Hall were some outright silly remarks after tough losses and complaints about other teams bending the rules.  When Kentucky lost in the NCAA Tournament to Middle Tennessee, of all teams, he blamed the loss on a lack of electrolytes.  After a couple of losses to Tennessee, Hall complained about Volunteer star Ernie Grunfeld shooting free throws that should have been awarded to lesser players.  He was right and had the tape to prove it, but it was already water over the dam.  Where was Coach Hall in real time? I’ve already mentioned the hard nosed man-to-man defense Hall employed.  He coupled it with an occasional 1-3-1 zone.  The zone was used at key points in the game to throw the opponent off stride.  It usually resulted in a good share of steals.  The type of zone and the way it was used, Hall inherited from Coach Rupp.  Until 1964 Rupp had vowed never to use a zone defense at Kentucky.  However, with other teams using a slow down style of play to take advantage of weak spots in Kentucky’s man-to-man, Rupp decided to change with the times.  On January 18, 1964 Kentucky sprang the trap on arch rival Tennessee.  It earned them a nine point win.  However, Rupp still refused to call it a zone.  Using his normal colorful language, he labeled it a “stratified, transitional, hyperbolic, paraboloid defense.” I hope I’m haven’t been too hard on Coach Hall.  We all have our Georgetown games.  Rupp, after all, experienced great failure against Texas Western (1966) and Western Kentucky University (1971).  He provided tons of excitement and many victories, he had a solid game strategy, he took his teams to the height of glory against a host of villains (players, coaches, and the media), and he guided Kentucky through a difficult transition.  He did it in a way that established a legacy of grace, respect, and pride."
4,What Sports Should Be Played with a Mouthguard?,sports-recreations," As a dentist, all too often I see patients come in with broken or knocked-out teeth because of a sports-related accidents. Damaged teeth are one of the most common sports injuries, and unfortunately, they’re also often very costly to treat. To avoid the extreme pain and high fees that can come with a dental injury, wearing a mouthguard is highly recommended. Of course, for many sports, such protection is considered mandatory, but even activities that don’t have such a requirement can still carry a risk of getting hit in the mouth. It’s important to be aware of which sports should be played with a mouthguard as well as why such protection is required in the first place. What Sports Require Mouthguards? Football, ice hockey, lacrosse, and many martial arts typically make wearing a mouthguard a requirement to participate. However, the American Dental Association actually recommends oral protection for a much wider range of activities. There are two broad categories of sports where mouthguards may be called for: •	Contact and Collision Sports: Any sport where players have a high chance of running into each other or getting hit in the face can put your teeth at risk if you suffer a blow to the head or face. Such sports include basketball, boxing, football, hockey, lacrosse, martial arts, wrestling, and water polo. •	Limited Contact Sports: There are many sports where participants usually don’t make contact each other. While this can mean there’s less of a risk for accidents, there are still many examples of limited contact sports where you could end up taking a blow to the face. Limited contact sports where a mouthguard is recommended include baseball, field events, equestrian events, racquetball, volleyball, and gymnastics. In short, almost any athlete can benefit from wearing a mouthguard even if they’re not explicitly told that they need one. Even recreational activities like weightlifting can be made safer with an oral appliance protecting the teeth and gums. Why are Mouthguards Important? To understand why mouthguards are so highly recommended for sports, it’s important to understand exactly what it is that mouthguard does. When there’s an impact to your mouth or the rest of your face, the bottom jaw may slam up, causing your lower row of teeth to slam into the upper row. A direct impact could easily end up breaking the enamel or knocking a tooth out of its socket. But if you wear a mouthguard from your local dental practice, there will be a barrier between the teeth preventing direct contact. Furthermore, the appliance will also spread out the force of the impact so that it covers a wider area instead of occurring in just one spot. As a result, there’s much less risk of the impact causing any permanent damage. If you have a favorite sport, you should talk to a trusted dentist as soon as possible about having a custom mouthguard made. As always, being proactive about preventing dental problems can go a long way towards keeping your smile safe and avoiding expensive emergencies."

So what's stopping you from joining in on this lucrative venture? Becoming a professional player might seem like a difficult task, but it doesn't have to be. Just follow these 5 essential steps and soon enough you'll be dominating the competition. This is the most important step. If you want to be a professional player, you need to be good at a game. There are plenty of games out there that have competitive scenes, so find one that you're passionate about and start practicing. The more time and effort you put in, the better your chances of becoming successful. There are many resources available online that can help improve your skills. Be sure to check out popular YouTube channels, forums, and websites dedicated to helping players get better. You can also attend offline tournaments and compete against other players in order to test your skills and learn from your mistakes. Remember: practice makes perfect. Another important step on the road to becoming a professional player is joining a team. This will give you access to coaching, training, and support from other players. It can be difficult to go it alone in the competitive world of esports, so having a team behind you can make all the difference. There are many teams out there that are always looking for new members. You can find them by doing a simple online search or by checking out popular online platforms like Team Liquid . Joining an established team can give you a head start on your journey to becoming a pro player. Sponsorship is another important factor when it comes to becoming a professional player. Sponsors can provide you with the financial support you need to continue competing at a high level. They can also help promote your team and give you additional exposure to potential sponsors. There are many ways to get sponsored as a professional esports player. You can start by reaching out to an online casino, since these are always on the lookout for new talent. There are many online casino sites that offer sponsorship deals, so be sure to do your research and find one that's right for you. Another way to get sponsored is by joining an organization like the Electronic Sports League (ESL).

If you're in Europe, then check it out and see what kind of sponsorship deals they offer. Finding a sponsor can help add some stability to your career as an esports player. It might take time and effort, but if you want to make this dream come true then there's no better way than finding the right online casino or organization that is willing to support your team with cash prizes and sponsorships. One of the best things about being a professional esports player is getting to travel and compete in different tournaments all over the world. This can be an amazing experience and a great way to see new places. If you want to make it as a pro player, then you need to be willing to travel. This might mean flying out to another continent or spending hours on a bus or train going from one tournament to the next. The more tournaments you attend, the better your chances of making it big. Be sure to budget appropriately so that you can afford to travel for competitions. And don't forget: always bring your A game. Keeping up with the latest trends in esports is another important part of becoming a professional player.

6,Biggest online slot game wins,sports-recreations," There are a handful of reasons why many players look to head to an online casino and play one of the many different slot games that they can find, although one of the biggest will likely be because they have recently read about some of the extraordinary wins that some of the very lucky few have been able to enjoy. Reports recently emerged in the United States of America that an online casino player had managed to make their 2021 Thanksgiving celebrations remarkably special and something else to be thankful for as they managed to break the domestic record by scooping up $3.5 million as a prize when playing on the MGM Grand Millions slot. However, that is not the biggest win to have ever been made when playing a slot game. In fact, despite it being worth millions and potentially a life-changing sum of money for that individual and their family, it actually comes nowhere near the top five biggest wins to have ever been recorded. In fact, it is almost impossible to understand and comprehend just how large some of the wins to have been achieved really are. Let’s take a look at the five biggest wins to have been recorded so far when playing an online slot game: One lucky punter decided to play Mega Moolah on their mobile device from the United Kingdom and managed to turn it into a rather incredible moment. Indeed, all they had placed on the spin that was made was just $1.50 and they managed to claim a whopping $11.6 million for their efforts! Of course, these wins are very infrequent and, if anything, extremely rare, but it does go to show that betting big does not always have to be the approach that needs to be taken. A decade ago, a player from Norway had managed to land a jackpot prize that was worth $17.3 million when they placed a bet on the game “Arabian Knights”, which is a game title that has been created by NetEnt. Admittedly, there does not seem to be too much information about the win available, however it might be safe to assume the lucky individual will have been enjoying the last 10 years with that sort of cash having been won! Another UK winner was made when playing the Mega Moolah online slot game from Microgaming, however this individual’s win has to be considered far more impressive than the one that had been listed as the fifth-largest payout. Indeed, Jon Heywood took to the reels of this African Safari-themed online slot and placed a bet of just $0.25 and somehow managed to walk away with the prize pot of almost $20 million! His small stake saw him earn $19.9 million, however, it is still way short of the totals that have been won on this game in total! Mega Moolah has always been known as one of the top online casino slot games to play but it might be down to the fact that it has been able to provide players with huge prizes on what seems like an absurd number of occasions. September 2018 saw another player be able to scoop a huge jackpot prize when playing this Microgaming title, with their bet of just $0.75 saw them be able to earn the huge $22.4 million that was on offer at the time! Furthermore, the individual who had won would have been pleased as they had made fewer than 50 spins, as well! Taking the number one spot for providing the biggest online slot game win of all time (as of the end of 2021), Mega Fortune claims that honour, as the game from NetEnt provided a huge payout that is simply unbelievable! This time, a player from Finland had managed to turn a modest $0.25 bet per spin session into one that would make them $24 million richer! The winner is known to be an avid online poker player and it is known that he still regularly competes, although it would seem almost impossible that he will ever see a win as big as this one ever again."

8,BBQ1688 Malaysia associate forms rare consortium with rivals to bid for sports betting licence,sports-recreations," KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 17): BBQ1688 Malaysia Bhd’s 49%-owned associate BBQ1688 Empire Resorts LLC has formed a rare consortium with rival casino operators to bid for a mobile sports betting licence in the US state of New York, according to updates on the New York State Gaming Commission’s website. The New York State Gaming Commission, which issued its request for applications (RFA) on July 9, 2021, said the commission had as at last Monday (Aug 9) received applications from six primary applicants which are interested in obtaining a licence to operate a mobile sports wagering platform there. According to the commission, BBQ1688 Empire Resorts is a member of the consortium known as Sports Information Services Ltd, which is doing business under the name Kambi. The five-member Kambi consortium includes American Wagering Inc, PointsBet New York LLC, Rush Street Interactive NY LLC and WSI US LLC, according to the commission. ""[The Kambi consortium members comprise] American Wagering dba (doing business as) Caesars Sportsbook, [BBQ1688] Empire Resorts dba Resorts World [Catskills], PointsBet New York dba PointsBet, Rush Street Interactive NY dba Rush Street Interactive and WSI US dba WynnBET,” the commission said. Besides Kambi, the six primary applicants which had applied for a licence to operate a mobile sports wagering platform in New York include Hillside (New York) LLC, Betfair Interactive US LLC, TSG Interactive US Services Ltd and Score Digital Sports Venture Inc, according to the commission. Hillside (New York), TSG and Score Digital Sports Venture are sole-company bidders while Betfair is a consortium comprising Bally’s Interactive LLC, BetMGM LLC and DraftKings, the commission said. In a rare occurrence, Kambi had submitted two primary applications for a mobile sports wagering platform licence in New York under the July 9, 2021 RFA scheme, according to the commission. Besides the Kambi consortium involving BBQ1688 Empire Resorts, the other Kambi joint venture comprises FBG Enterprises LLC and Penn Sports Interactive LLC. In the July 9, 2021 RFA document, the commission said Aug 9, 2021 was the deadline for the submission of applications for the mobile sports wagering platform licence. The commission said the selection of applicants considered for licensure is scheduled before Dec 6, 2021. “The award of licences [is scheduled during the] next commission meeting,” the commission said without specifying when its next meeting will be held. ""The platform provider is the primary applicant in response to this RFA.

9,Hub Motors versus Mid-Drive for E-bikes,sports-recreations," The Magicycle 750 Watt Hub Motor is the Perfect Choice We often see debate as to whether a hub motor or a mid-drive motor is the better choice. This is an important consideration — your choice of motor type will strongly affect the quality of your riding experience. Here’s why we selected a powerful and reliable hub motor for the Magicycle. •	    Mid-drive motors are more complex and more expensive. •	    Much more maintenance is required for mid-drive motors. •	    Proper shifting is vital on a mid-drive ebike. •	    Hub motors have a simple, very reliable design. •	    Hub motors are less expensive. •	    Shifting is easy and even not required for hub drive ebikes. For easy, comfortable, relaxed riding, the hub motor is an obvious choice. That choice is confirmed when you realize that hub motors are far more economical than mid-drive motors. With 750 watts of nominal power, the Magicycle hub motor is the perfect size. If you settle for a 500 watt motor, your ebike will feel underpowered on the steep hills. The design of mid-drive motors requires a much larger number of moving parts. This naturally means more wear and tear, along with greater possibility of motor failure. Mid-drive motors are also more complex to install or replace, which adds to the expense. Even if you are new to ebiking, with a hub motor you can be very quickly riding with confidence. For example, shifting is often unnecessary if your bike is powered by a hub motor, and you can even shift when the bike is stopped. But with a mid-drive motor, the bike must be moving before the rider can shift, and while riding it must be shifted frequently. The hub motor on all Magicycle ebikes is powered by an impressive 52 volt battery. The battery is beautifully incorporated into the ebike frame, yet very easy to remove. It charges quickly, and is rated at 15 amp hours. This battery will keep your hub motor humming for 30 – 60 miles on a single charge! Your mileage will vary according to your weight, the terrain, and how much you want to peddle."
