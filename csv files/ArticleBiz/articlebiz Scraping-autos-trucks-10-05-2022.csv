0,6 Popular Accessories That Protects Your Vehicle's Interior,autos-trucks," There are 6 popular accessories that you can purchase to protect your vehicle's appearance.. The accessories mentioned here are the most purchased products to keep your vehicle looking clean and attractive. Whether you are looking to protect the interior or exterior, measures taken to keep your vehicle looking its best and, at the same time, insuring retention of the vehicle’s top value, will be highly beneficial when it comes time to trade it in or sell. Even if you are not looking at selling your car in the near future, using accessories like new seat covers, floor mats or a car bra will make you proud to be seen in your vehicle, as well as the protection these accessories will provide. Lets take a moment and see how each interior accessory can improve a vehicle's appearance. Front-End Car Bra: The front-end car bra is an accessory that will provide protection for your vehicle’s front end, including chips to the paint and grill. The car bra is made to fit snugly and perfectly for maximum protection. Its value is in its ability to act as a guard from road hazards, such as bugs, chemicals (tar) and gravel on roadways. The bra also protects from pitting damage on your automobile’s grill and paint surfaces. The bra, while having an important protective feature, can also give your vehicle a classier appearance. A car bra is usually constructed of heavy vinyl and a firm padding underneath, the vehicle bra will stand the test of time. Most vehicle bras are easy to install and remove. The benefits in adding value, protection and a sleek look to your vehicle are well worth the small investment of a car front-end bra. Bug/Chipping Shields: Bug shields are another valuable protective piece you can add to your vehicle. Modern bug shields are designed aerodynamically to not only compliment the look of your car’s front end, but they also maximize fuel usage. By not allowing the air force to push against the vehicle, the aerodynamically made bug shields create a diversion in air flow so that your car doesn’t have to use extra fuel to compensate for the additional pressure. Bug shields are great for protecting your car from road debris, excessive bug collection and chipping from stones or other road hazards. Car Covers: A car cover is an essential accessory if you leave your vehicle outside in the harsh elements of the sun, rain or snow. The cover will protect your car from wear and tear and the hazards of extreme weather conditions when a garage or cover protection is not available. It should fit snugly around the normally exposed portions of the vehicle. Car covers are usually made of a heavy duty protected material that will keep the damaging weather elements away from the automobile’s painted surfaces. Car covers are especially valuable if you use them while shopping or when the vehicle is parked near someone or something that can bump into the vehicle and create paint or body damage. Floor Mats: Floor Mats are the perfect accessory to give your interior a new or more finished look. The mats are indispensable in the protection they provide against wear and tear on the floor's carpet. You can purchase floor mats in most any variety of colors, styles, and designs. They are available in materials such as rubber and clear plastic to name a few. Floor mats can be custom made specifically to your vehicle or purchased at auto parts stores. The benefits to having floor mats cannot be overstated. They aid in comfort when driving on long road trips, they protect from shoe damage in the acceleration area of the floor and they keep everyday dirt and grime from attaching to your vehicle’s original carpet. Purchasing floor mats at nominal prices can give your vehicle protection from years of floor or carpet damage in the vehicle. Window Tint: No matter what part of the world you live in, tinting your vehicle’s windows can offer protection in many ways. Window tinting has long been known to reduce the heat coming into your vehicle. Anyone that owns an automobile in the southwest will tell you that the sun’s heat (and damaging ultraviolet rays) is not only destructive, it is downright uncomfortable. So in these two ways, tinting can increase your comfort while driving and decrease fading or discoloration of the interior’s vinyl or fabric seats and dashboard. By choosing a safety film, you will get even more protection. A safety film on your vehicle’s windows has been known to reduce injuries to occupants from flying shattered glass in auto accidents. If you have a large object hit your windshield, the safety film may also stop the object from coming directly into your vehicle and hitting the driver and any passengers. If you live in tornado or earthquake zones, this type of film can also prevent injury as well, by acting as a buffer between you and the shattered glass. Seat Covers: Lastly, but certainly not less important, is seat covers and their numerous benefits. Seat covers protect the material of your car’s seats. This is very important for owners that: Live in sun drenched areas of the world, Work in conditions where your clothing is contaminated with dirt, grease, or other destructive materials, Participate in activities such as biking, hiking, or swimming (the chlorine alone is severely damaging if you are not fully dried off). Seat covers are not just about protecting, they can also provide a tailored and clean look to your vehicle’s interior. Your vehicle will look well kept and well taken care of if you purchase seat covers before any damage occurs. You can pull them off before selling or trading in your vehicle for that eye-appealing look that says you, the owner, took very good care of the car. Sometimes a clean and fresh looking interior will sell a vehicle even if the exterior is a bit worn. While there are numerous other accessories out there for your vehicle, the ones mentioned here will go a long way in giving you peace of mind. You will know that you have done what you can to insure that your vehicle looks close to new, even when it is ten years old. If you choose to sell your vehicle someday, the added accessories will most likely bring you the maximum value when you sell or trade-in your vehicle. You can never lose by adding protective accessories to your car."
1,Why Are Catalytic Converters Being Stolen?,autos-trucks," Why Are Catalytic Converters Being Stolen? A Catalytic converters is a key component of a car’s emissions system, reducing the amount of harmful pollution going out the tailpipe. Catalytic converters first appeared on vehicles in the  United States in 1975. They help transform hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides (all the bad stuff) into water vapor and carbon dioxide, (the stuff we can live with). In a catalytic converter, the catalyst (in the form of platinum, palladium and rhodium) is coated onto a ceramic honeycomb that is housed in a muffler-like package attached to the exhaust pipe. Where is the catalytic converter located? The catalytic converter is located on the underside of your car, in the exhaust system between the exhaust manifold and muffler. How Are catalytic converter being Stolen? Thieves generally steal catalytic converters by sliding underneath a vehicle and sawing it  with a powerful hand-held power saw that’s capable of cutting metal at a very high speed, the whole operation can take under a minute. Vehicle repair shops that used to see 2-3 of these thefts per month have reported an increase of this thefts to as many as 5-10 thefts per day within the last year or so. How to tell your catalytic converter has been stolen When a catalytic converter has been removed, your car or truck will make a loud roaring sound that will get louder as you push the gas pedal. Depending on your vehicle, you may have check engine light turn on. Most newer vehicles are equipped with an engine control unit, also known as an ECM, that monitors various sensors in your engine. You can have a look under your vehicle and if your catalytic converter is missing, you will likely be able to see that somebody has cut a chunk out of your exhaust system. What should I do when my converter is stolen? Step 2: Contact the local authorities/Police If you find your catalytic converter has been stolen, its highly recommended to contact your local authorities/Police immediately so they can start an investigation by checking cameras nearby and work to see if they can help catch the person or group responsible for the theft. Additionally, a police report may be essential for you to get re-imbursed by insurance coverage. Step 2: Contact Your Insurance Company Depending on your vehicle insurance, your car insurance may cover your catalytic converter replacement. If you have comprehensive coverage on your vehicle, then you're typically covered against catalytic converter theft. Step 3: Visit a Mechanic Most cars will require an aftermarket Catalytic Converter to be welded to your vehicle exhaust pipes. The average cost of a catalytic converter replacement is between $500 and can be as high as $2500 including parts and labor. Prices will greatly vary depending on year, make and model of your vehicle. It usually takes from one to two hours for a typical catalytic converter replacement. While your new catalytic converter is being installed, you can ask your mechanic to add an anti-theft device to prevent future thefts. Can you drive without a catalytic converter? Most vehicles can be physically driven without a catalytic converter without any damage to your vehicle but it may be illegal to drive your vehicle without a catalytic converter in your state and your vehicle will most likely to fail and emissions test during inspection. How to prevent catalytic converter theft Its always a good idea to park your vehicle in well-lit areas when possible. If you have a personal garage, keep your car in the garage with the door closed when the vehicle is not in use. Some newer vehicles have a security settings that trigger the alarm when it senses vibrations. The sawing of your catalytic converter will be enough to set off these alarms. An after market alarm can also be installed on most vehicles at an affordable price. This will make your catalytic converter identifiable to law enforcement. The idea is that a thief who sees the etching moves on to an easier target. Police in some communities have joined with local vehicle repair shops to sponsor etching events. You can contact your local mechanics and find out if they offer this service. Having a Video surveillance around your garage or driveway is also useful if you have the budget for it. Most thieves would automatically leave when they see a camera. A steel shield that fits over the catalytic converter, requiring time and extra tools to remove. Cages made of rebar or other high-strength steel that's difficult to cut. Stainless steel cables welded from the catalytic converter to the car’s frame. Having the converter welded in place also makes it more difficult to remove"
2,How to Get Paid For Scrapping a Car,autos-trucks," Thanks to the high cost of scrap metal, your old, rusty, banged up car can make you decent cash if you know what to do with it. On average, you can make anywhere between $400 - $1200 on a non-running junk car if you follow the right steps to scrap your old car. The question remains how to do it. The following paragraphs will tell you exactly how. Most will tell you to find the nearest local scrapyard to get cash on your junk car but there are some things you need to do that will save you time and money. Step 1: Drains the Fluids The scrapyard will not take your car if it has fluids in it. So the first thing you want to do is drain the oil, the transmission fluid, the differential fluid, the freon, any gasoline in the tank - virtually everything needs to be evacuated. You will not be able to drain the freon because the process requires special equipment. Your local AC guy will have an evacuation machine to help you out in that regard. Step 2: Identify and Take Out Sellable Parts A common mistake a lot of people make is to move from step 1 straight to the scrap yard. The problem with that is, taking your junk car to the scrap yard without first identifying and removing some valuable parts will reduce the money you will get on the car. The scrapyard will give you a lump sum price that is usually determined by the car’s weight and sometimes its condition (availability of resellable parts like the airbag for example). Making you lose out on getting extra money on some of the things on the car you can remove and sell yourself. There are few things on a car that are worth money. For example, if your car has alloy or aluminum wheels you will want to take them off and sell on craigslist or Facebook marketplace. They are worth a lot of money on their own. You can get up to $250 for all four wheels. Other parts you would like to sell for extra cash are the center caps, hub caps, and emblems. They are easy to ship and are usually in high demand. You will be able to sell them for $30+. Tail lights, headlights, and side mirrors are common impact-damaged car parts and they are also usually in high demand. It takes a few minutes to disassemble and you can sell them north of $60 online. Step 3: Get Appropriate Paperwork To be able to sell your car to a scrap yard, you must have at least two documents - your ID and the vehicle’s registration papers. Most scrap yards will not demand the car’s title because they can just easily check for the VIN number on the car. As far the paperwork for the process goes, any reputable scrap yard will help you out with that (this should be a criteria in choosing a scrap yard you want to sell to). Step 4: Pick a Scrap Yard Speaking about choosing a scrap yard, there are some things you should look out for. First is the obvious - their prices. Some will try to lowball you on the cost of the vehicle so it is important you find out the price of vehicle parts so you can have a rough estimate in your head. This will guide you to get a fair price on your vehicle. Another thing you should look out for is their special service. Reputable scrap yards provide convenience and will most often offer to come pick your car for free. Also look out for their customer service. Questions like “how long does it take to complete a transaction” and “how will I get paid” should be satisfactorily answered. Typically, the answer to the former question should be nothing more than 24 hours."

4,Customising Your Company Vehicle: Why You Should Choose Wrapping Over Repainting,autos-trucks," We’ve all seen those company cars and vans, with custom logos, artwork, and advertising. Having your details written on a vehicle, alongside an eye-catching design, is a fantastic marketing strategy that quite literally takes your name on the road to your next potential client. But why is vehicle wrapping your best option, and not painting? Let's take a look. Affordability Having your vehicle(s) repainted can be a huge expense that will not only decrease the resale value of the vehicle, but make it difficult to alter in case of a rebrand, change of information, or liquidation. On the other hand, car wrapping is a less intrusive and often cheaper way of redesigning your vehicle to promote your business, by placing a large vinyl decal or graphic directly over the original paint. If you decide to resell the vehicle, the resale value will be much greater than a repainted car. This is due to being able to completely remove the wrap without damaging the original paintwork, meaning the vehicle will appear brand new. Durability Can you imagine spending your hard-earned money on a full body repaint, only to find it has been scratched by a stray stone on the road? Vinyl wrap is a lot more durable, providing a layer of protection over your original paintwork. It won’t get scratched as easily as paint, so you can relax knowing that your new look vehicle will stay looking great for much longer. Precision Painting graphics and specific designs can be extremely difficult. You are relying on the artistry of an individual and there is no guarantee that your vehicle will live up to your expectations. But when you decide to have your vehicle wrapped, you will be able to see exactly how it will turn out before the wrap is applied. Design elements like lettering will also be more precise, as there is more freedom to adjust and reposition the wrap to suit the contours of the vehicle. Installation Time If you were to opt for having your vehicle repainted, you will be looking at one to two weeks before it is ready for collection. Once receiving your newly painted car, you will then need to allow time for the paint to dry properly before driving it regularly. It only takes three to five days for a vehicle to be fully wrapped, and it will be ready to drive immediately after collection. Maintenance To keep that ‘new car’ shine on your repainted car, you will need to make sure it is washed and waxed regularly. This can take up a lot of time, money, and effort. Car wraps will keep that ‘new car’ shine automatically and will only require occasional washing (bar any unforeseen bird mishaps). This means you can spend less time cleaning, and more time driving. Repetition Something you may want to consider if you have a fleet of vehicles that need customising, is the ability to correctly duplicate the same design. If you are spending money to brand your vehicles, you want your graphics to be consistent across all of them. Repainting vehicles can lead to all sorts of unforeseen, unavoidable variables such as colour changes, lettering issues, and positioning problems. The benefit of opting for a car wrap is that you can guarantee a uniform fleet, identical to the original design, and you won’t have to worry about a misspelt word or wonky logo. Changing Minds The great thing about car wrapping is that if you change your mind, want to go in a different direction, or no longer have use of a company car or fleet, you can easily have the wrap taken off. This will revert the vehicle to its original state, causing no damage to the original paintwork. Conclusion The way your company vehicle looks reflects you and your business, so it is vital that you give your potential clients the right impression. Opting to have your car wrapped will ensure that one of your key marketing assets will look eye-catching, professional, and make people want to know more."
5,5 Simple Tips For Smooth Driving In Winter,autos-trucks," Winter can be one of the most challenging seasons for driving. Weather extremes might include heavy snow, freezing fog, reduced visibility, slippery conditions on the road, and more. But it is also a time when many of us are still very busy — especially when preparing for Christmas and New Year. While it is important to prepare well for driving in Winter and take all the necessary safety precautions, this does not need to be difficult or time-consuming. With the simple but highly effective tips below, you can prepare your car to meet the challenges of Winter and enjoy a smooth season of driving. TIP 1: Book In Advance As the busy holiday season of Halloween, Bonfire Night, and Christmas approaches, demand for services may be higher than ever. This is also true of all things automotive. If you urgently need a repair or service, consider booking early to avoid disappointment. Many garages are currently experiencing busy periods and may have weeks of waiting time to consider. This is also the case for driving tests - which have experienced a major backlog since lockdown, when social distancing made taking the test difficult or even impossible. Leaving an issue too late, such as a problem that then makes the car unsafe to drive, can be a major inconvenience. To avoid disappointment, aim to book necessary services and appointments well in advance. TIP 2: Reduce Your Driving Where possible, it can be helpful to reduce your driving in the Winter to only include essential journeys. Sticking to essential journeys can be safer as well as more environmentally friendly. You will not be contributing to additional congestion on the roads, or risking dangerous icy conditions, for example. If you use your car for work or business deliveries, consider delegating the task or outsourcing where possible. For example, more businesses than ever are switching to professional couriers to reduce their own driving. Decreasing your driving — or at least driving in a more fuel-efficient manner — is a great way to reduce overall spending and keep your Winter budget in check too. This is especially important due to certain seasonal added costs such as Christmas shopping and increased heating bills, for example. TIP 3: Make Any Minor Repairs It can be tempting to skip a car service until we find we have a serious issue that needs to be addressed. But taking early action can be safer and more cost-effective in the long run. Winter weather often exacerbates existing complications. It can make small issues into big problems in a short space of time, and leave you urgently needing a service at a very busy time of year. You can avoid this problem by doing a realistic assessment of what is currently bothering you about your car — such as unusual sounds, struggles, or a crack in the windscreen, for example — and then booking in at a reputable garage to get everything sorted. Shoring up minor issues is a great way to reduce the likelihood of a major issue later down the line as the weather becomes more severe. TIP 4: Be Prepared There is no better way to deal with an emergency or inconvenience than to be prepared for it in advance. Any change of season — and perhaps especially Winter — is a great time to take steps to prepare your car. This can include ensuring that you have up-to-date breakdown cover or roadside rescue in the event of an emergency, as well as packing your own essentials kit. A kit might include anti-freeze, blankets, a torch, mobile phone charger, water, and any details for your breakdown cover. It can also be worth checking any important routes in advance in case of diversions or accidents, and allowing extra time for journeys in the event of bad weather. This may be especially important for visits to family, or to Santa’s Grotto! Plan ahead, allow extra time, and you will be prepared for any eventuality. TIP 5: Protect Your Car The Winter season can be punishing for a car. Damage can be caused by excess moisture, frost, rust, and more. Take extra steps to prepare and protect your car where possible — such as investing in a car cover, using a garage, or even just parking safely - such as far from trees in windy conditions. You could also invest in specialised Winter tyres with the safest tread depth, incorporate a regular check process in your routine to identify any problems, as well as being sure to clean your lights and windscreens of any debris."
6,5 Great Ways That Car Wrapping Can Promote Your Business,autos-trucks," If you own a business, then you know the importance of standing out from the competition. Car wrapping is a simple yet powerful way to promote your business all year round — and more companies than ever before are choosing to use it. Car wrapping involves a professional team adding a striking, bespoke design to your vehicle that will promote your chosen message, logo, or business. The effect is sleek, cohesive, and very memorable — whether in personal or professional settings. Car wrapping is acknowledged as an innovative and effective way of promoting businesses. Below, we take a look at some of the key ways that it achieves this, and how they could apply to you and your business. A huge advantage of car wrapping is that it is a constant, ‘evergreen’ form of advertising. It does not require anyone to be on-site or in a particular location to see it, such as on the premises of your business. The advertising is always there on your company vehicle, regardless of whether you change your location, premises, or website, for example. For as long as you have a company car, your business can enjoy constant promotion! Bespoke vehicle wraps are incredibly striking and eye-catching for whoever passes them. The advantage is that they do not need to be in one static place such as on a billboard or sign that only certain people may pass. As advertisements, they are completely portable! This allows you to make use of every journey and travel opportunity — even your daily commute — to advertise your business or sponsor. Your bespoke car wrap could include a logo, contact details, simply a stunning design with your business name, and more. Car wrapping is especially effective if you are regularly attending events, conferences, or industry roadshows too. You are advertising to like-minded people and industry insiders without even having to open your mouth. Your stunning car wrap speaks for you and your business! Because car wrapping and vehicle wrapping is so portable, this can also mean that you are constantly widening your demographic. It is not only one type or age range of person that sees your advertisement, for example. It is whoever is on the road or in the vicinity, especially at busy times. This can mean that your business is reaching those who may not otherwise have come across it. This can be a great way to ‘fill in the gap’ between those potential clients who may, for example, search for a business online and those who may not even know it exists. While it is likely that other forms of advertising for your business may be very targeted and specific, a bespoke professional car wrap can be a powerful addition to your advertising that is constant, versatile, and affordable by comparison. Car and vehicle wrapping does not only have to be a way for you to advertise your own business. You may also choose to advertise sponsors, or other businesses you collaborate with. As an advertising opportunity, or for sponsors specifically, this can serve as additional income for you and your business. You may choose for your car wrap design to combine both your business logo and the logo of a sponsor, for example, or even run monthly advertisements or sponsorships for paying clients. This can be especially successful for upcoming events or promotions. Car wrapping is a great way to create visual cohesion in your team and company. If you have multiple vehicles, a service that sends out drivers or personnel, or simply want to foster a strong company culture visually, then car wrapping can be a great way to achieve this. Car wrapping helps to ensure that your vehicles look official, distinctive, and instantly recognisable. It helps personnel to feel a part of the team, and has the additional benefits mentioned above of advertising on the go! If company cars are used regularly or are visible to clients and customers, a variety of vehicles and designs can quickly create a sense of clutter and disorganisation. Car wrapping helps the company to embody an image that is sleek, cohesive, and ‘official’."
7,6 Simple Ways To Prepare Your Car For The ‘Back To School Season’,autos-trucks," Whether it’s back to work or back to school, September marks the end of Summer and the start of a busy new season. With so much to organise and remember, it can be easy to become overwhelmed and overlook some of the things that could make your life simpler — such as taking care of your car. But a well-maintained, reliable car is a great way to help ensure that journey times, commutes, and busy daily life all go as smoothly as they can. Browse the six simple but highly effective tips below, and see how much easier you could make your Autumn! Spring cleaning may be the most famous, but cleaning at the start of any new season is a positive habit. Before the rush of the school and work runs, it is a great time to declutter and sanitise your car. Remove any rubbish that has built up, wipe down surfaces, and make especially sure to clean or tidy areas that may impede visibility while driving. This includes ornaments or objects that obscure the back or front windscreens. A tidy, clutter-free car will not only be safer and more hygienic, but it may help you to feel more refreshed and in control too. Carrying various essential kits in your car can be a great way to ensure peace of mind without taking up too much space. The best kits include first aid, repairs, and breakdown items such as a spare tyre, tools, or even just important roadside service contact details. You can also pack things that are specific to you or your family — such as additional medication or inhalers for example, or snacks, a spare mobile phone, and more. There is no need to overload your car, or feel like you have to plan for every eventuality. But a few important items can make all the difference! A change of season is a great time to book in at your local garage for a comprehensive check-up. Perhaps there is something that has been niggling in your car, or you just want to check that it is running optimally. Now is a great time to fix minor repair issues before they have the chance to worsen. Your car will be safer, more comfortable to drive, and likely to last longer too! Your local garage can also be a great place to stock up on some of the seasonal essentials — especially anti-freeze, car covers, and other handy items that will help to make the cold weather easier. As the weather changes — and especially when more wind and rain arrives — journey times can take a little longer than we expect. Rather than rushing, risking an accident, or arriving flustered, simply prepare to allow a little extra time in your journey. You can also save time by ensuring that your car is prepped in advance for longer journeys, such as by inflating tyres, topping up with fuel, or charging an electric car to its full mileage range. Weather-appropriate tyres are a great idea to improve the safety and manageability of your car, as may be suggested by your garage. You may also feel confident enough to do it yourself, but otherwise seek the advice of a professional. Using Summer and Winter tyres can be especially important because they function best at different temperatures, and have different tread depths that suit the weather they were made for. Be sure that your tyres can cope with your local climate, whether that is mild and wet, cold and icy, or anything in between. Once your car is clean, safe, and roadworthy, now is the time to emphasise comfort. Why not add some form of treat or luxury to refresh your car for the new season? A new scent, a favourite soundtrack, or even more comfortable seating can make your car a pleasure to drive. Pick a change to suit your needs and budget, and you will feel like you’re driving a whole new vehicle! Small investments and maintenance from season to season are safer and more cost-effective than arranging major overhauls when a problem develops and you really need them. With the tips above, you can help ensure that your car is a pleasure to drive in the ‘back to school season’ and beyond!"
