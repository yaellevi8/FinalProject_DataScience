0,Your Complete Guide To Packing And Move,home," Moving can be very difficult, that is why we have scoured the internet to provide you with a good article to help answer any moving questions you might have. Sit back, relax and read this article to get your questions answered. It’s almost that time—you’re about to start packing up your home so you can move somewhere else. But where to begin? Many people experience anxiety about moving, largely because the process often feels like a big job with no clear steps to follow. This can lead to hasty packing at the last minute, which may lead to certain items being lost or damaged in the move. Of course, there’s no reason your upcoming move needs to be anywhere near as chaotic—whether you’re moving locally or long distance! And if you pack properly, it won’t be. That’s why we’ve put together a complete guide to packing your home for a move. Read on, and discover how to make moving a breeze. Where to Start the Packing Process One of the questions we get most often at M&M Movers is about what items should be boxed up first. But in fact, what you pack first isn’t as important as where you start your packing—down to the specific room. Step 1: Pack Items You’ve Already Stored When: about 3 weeks out from moving day. Chances are, you’ve got a few items in your home that are already in storage—things you never unpacked from the last move, or things that you’ll only use intermittently throughout the year. Since these items are already packed, they’ll be the easiest to get ready for your upcoming move. Just make sure you still actually want them! In fact, we recommend doing a thorough sweep of the whole house before you start packing, so you can get rid of any items you don’t want coming with you to the new place and save yourself the trouble of trying to find room for them. Step 2: Pack the Rooms You Use Least Often When: 2 weeks or so away from moving day. Once you’ve readied your already-packed items, the best room to start packing in is the one you use least. The attic, basement, garage, or shed are all promising candidates. Why, you might ask? Simple: The things you pack away first will be the ones that stay in boxes longest; the ones you won’t be able to access while everything else is being stored. If they’re the first boxes into the truck, they’ll also be the ones that come out last—so these should be the items you can go without for a while. Step 3: Tackle the Toughest Rooms in the House When: at least 1 week before moving. Okay, the items you can do without for a while are all packed up. Now what? This is the perfect time in your packing process to take on the tough rooms: often the bedrooms or living room. Here’s why: these places tend to be larger spaces with lots of furniture and knick-knacks. They’re often cluttered before a move, so chances are good that they’ll be full of items that need your attention. Packing these rooms early on in your move means you’ll have enough energy to focus on what’s going where—reducing the likelihood of losing things. Plus, getting these spaces out of the way early will make the rest of your move feel easy by comparison. Couple High Fiving Over Successful Packing Packing Specific Items Step 4: Pack Your Decor & Books When: the weekend before the move. Now that you’ve organised the biggest and scariest (from a moving perspective, anyway) zones of your home, you can shift your focus to packing specific items. Now is when we recommend boxing up curtains, rugs, wall hangings, and other items in your home that mainly serve an aesthetic purpose. This is also when you should pack up your books, if you didn’t do that already during the bedroom/living room step. Since you likely won’t be reading every book in your home from now until the move, keeping them out takes up space and serves no useful purpose. Step 5: Pack Clothes, Shoes, & Accessories When: at least 4 or 5 days before moving. Your outfits are different from your book collection, in that you probably don’t wear the same outfit for weeks or months at a time before switching to the next one you own. As such, you can’t just put every outfit but the one you’re wearing in storage. Fortunately, at this point, there are only a few days until your move. It’s perfectly acceptable to keep two or three outfits and some essentials in a weekender, and rotate through them in the days leading up to your move. Everything else should be cleaned, folded, and boxed or bagged up. The Final Stages of Packing Your Home Step 6: Kitchen & Bathroom Areas When: 1 to 2 days before moving. Your kitchen and bathroom are areas you use on a daily basis, so you don’t want to empty them with weeks to go until you move. In fact, you’ll probably want to make sure your bathroom doesn’t get packed up until the day before you move (so that you still have everything you need to maintain your hygiene beforehand). Kitchens are a little trickier, because they often contain a lot of items and can be frustrating to pack up at the last minute. Cookware and glasses can also be delicate, so you can’t just throw them in a box at the very end of the moving process. Here’s what we recommend: Pack up appliances you don’t use regularly during Step 2, so that they’re put with the other things you can go without for a while. Pack up all but the essential utensils, plates, pots and pans during Step 5, so that you’ll have them until you go Spartan for a few days and start living out of your weekender bag. Pack up the remaining kitchen items 1 or 2 days before you move, and treat yourself to a couple of takeout meals. This will give you a reward for packing up everything in time, and you won’t spend the last few hours in your old home washing dishes. Step 7: The Final Sweep This last one’s pretty self-explanatory. Go through your home looking for any items that may have eluded you during your packing and put them in a box or two for “miscellaneous” things. That’s it—congratulations! You’ve successfully packed your home for a move. Remember, packing shouldn’t cause panic. The rule of thumb to follow here is, start with the items you’ll need least before the move and the largest, most cluttered spaces. Then work your way down to the small things and rooms you use almost every day, setting aside a few essentials so that you have what you’ll need to live comfortably (albeit simply) in the days immediately prior to moving.

1,The early signs of bed bugs,home," If you have bed bugs, there is no time to wait. There are people who do this for a living and can come in and save your stuff and remove the infestation while it’s still small. Some of the early signs that you may actually have bed bugs include: – small brown stains on bed sheets – tiny cream-colored spots on your sheet or mattress (these are bed bug poop) – actually seeing the little monsters – you wake up feeling itchy in random places, this is because of their bite. If you see any of these signs, get in contact with a professional right away to get help to get rid of the infestation. Bed bugs will often bite while their food (you) is asleep. The following are the early signs of bed bugs to look for: Blood Stains – This is probably one of the earliest signs that you can find on your sheets. These are small dots or stains which are reddish-brown in colour. They are caused by the excretion of blood after feeding on human or animal blood. Bed Bug Bites – You can find these tiny bugs crawling around your bed at night and biting you especially if you leave uncovered skin exposed. These bites will show up as red bumps with a white centre which will be swollen and itchy. The good news is that they tend to disappear without leaving any scarring but there have been cases where people have experienced allergic reactions to the bites which might even be potentially dangerous. Bug Faeces or Droppings – You can also look for dark brown spots which are usually long and cylindrical in shape. They have a rough texture to them and they will appear dry and flat on your sheets. If it is possible to find a few of these droppings then there is a good chance that you have an infestation going on. Burrows or Egg Sacs – These bugs tend to hide in feather beds, mattresses and other places where they will not be disturbed. Dead Bugs – If you happen to be up late at night then you may notice that there are tiny bugs crawling on your blanket or sheets which have been piled up. In most cases, these bugs will be completely flat as they lack blood but there is also a possibility that those who have been crushed left behind some blood stains as well which can lead to confusion. The first sign of a bed bug infestation is usually visible to the naked eye. Look for small red or brown dots that resemble early-stage flea bites. These bites will often itch, and they may appear in any area of the body where blood would normally close to the skin. However, if you begin seeing these marks but aren’t noticing any itching whatsoever, it might be because the bugs are injecting anaesthetic into your bloodstream as they bite down on your skin’s surface. This can lead to delayed reactions and even large outbreaks appearing weeks after you thought you’d eradicated all of them from your home. Other signs of a bed bug infestation include: Blood spots on sheets – especially pillowcases Eggs and egg shells – which are tiny white specks. Bug faeces– which are small brown droppings. Moulted bed bug skins – these look like old patches of skin from a snake, and they’re usually found near the areas where the bugs tend to hide. These first signs should prompt you to begin a fast-paced inspection of your home. Bed bugs can pop up anywhere that’s warm and dark, so it’s important to check any area where you spend a lot of time sleeping. Look for bugs themselves as well as their eggs and shells, but don’t stop there: continue checking every item in your bedroom as well as other commonly accessed areas throughout your home such as under furniture or behind baseboards. This is because once you’ve eliminated an infestation from one room, those tenacious little bugs will keep reinfecting the same room if they can’t find another suitable hiding place. If you’re noticing any of these signs, it’s a good idea to call a pest control company immediately and schedule an inspection. Sometimes the smallest infestations can quickly become large ones if left untreated, so don’t put off calling for help! What do  bed bugs look like? It is not easy to spot bed bugs. Their size ranges from 1 millimetre to 7 millimetres. They appear as a small, flat and oval-shaped brown bug. Bed bugs are often compared to apple seeds in appearance .

2,Builders: Gold Coast Renovators,home," One of the results of the entire world being locked down for the past year and a half is that fewer of us are taking holidays or even leaving our homes unless we have to, this being one of the reasons so many Australians are choosing to renovate their home since they're spending so much time there anyway. Top-notch building renovations in the Gold Coast include all types of projects, both big and small, that have helped people feel a little better about staying at home so much. And if you're curious about some of the most popular renovations taking place, below are a handful of them. Textures add a lot of ambience to any room in your home, and at one time, the only textures you saw in a house were added by rugs, blankets, and curtains. That is no longer the case. Today, the walls can have a textured look as well, and we're not talking about that tacky raised wallpaper that we saw in the 1970s. These textures are subtle and mimic luxurious materials such as marble and many others. They come in a variety of shades and colours to match anyone's decor. People can also add wall panels and wooden beams to add texture to the room, and it certainly adds some pizzazz to each and every room in your home. Perhaps due to being confined to the home for so long, one of the things that has resulted from this is a desire to connect with the great outdoors. In turn, Australian homeowners have turned to things such as wooden furniture, concrete kitchens, organic shapes, lots of textures, and even earthy, very neutral tones and shades. Bringing the outdoors inside, so to speak, is also a great way to connect with nature in a simple way, but it also helps to make the rooms in your home look a whole lot better. Professional building renovations in the Gold Coast now often include very minimalist designs because people are more anxious to get back to a simpler lifestyle. Minimalist artwork, in fact, can bring not only aesthetic appeal to the home but also a sense of calmness and serenity. A minimalist design means less clutter and usually the use of tones and colours that calm you down, including earthy tones and soft colours such as lavender. It is a great look for anyone who loves the idea of getting back to basics. The kitchen is a very important room in any home, and since it sometimes doubles as a home office these days, people are paying a lot more attention to how it looks. And you don't always need expert building renovations in the Gold Coast to get this done. You can just give the cupboards a new coat of paint and suddenly you can enjoy contrasting colour themes such as black and grey, red and white, or just add a splash of colour to a kitchen that consists of mostly neutral tones. It's easy to do and inexpensive as well, making it the perfect home-improvement Project."
3,The Cost of Professional Outdoor Lighting Explained,home," The bid I got for outdoor lighting is more than I was expecting. Why is outdoor lighting so expensive? You have your vision for your outdoor project and landscape lighting, you’ve had a lighting professional come help you design your project to meet your needs and make your vision a reality, you are super excited and eager to begin, the he sends you the quote and your heart sinks. It’s more than you were expecting to pay and now you are unsure if it fits into your budget or if it’s really worth it. So why is outdoor lighting so expensive? One reason outdoor lighting is so expensive is the materials used. Have you ever gone to Lowe’s or Home Depot and picked up a pair of solar lights and held them in your hands? Have you ever tapped the material or really examined the bulbs? If you have and then have the opportunity to hold a fixture from a professional lighting company, you will feel a huge difference in weight as well as type of material used. The difference between professional fixture materials that are made to last, and cheap plastic fixtures that aren’t designed to withstand harsh weather is noticeable immediately. The one’s at Lowe’s will crack and split rather quickly, and there is a huge difference aesthetically. In addition longevity comes into play. Cheaper lighting fixtures and solar lights from your local Lowe’s are made to last roughly one and a half years, while professional fixtures are built to last roughly twenty years to thirty years. You are paying for that difference. In addition, cheaper lights typically only light up at the light or create a blinding spot light that still highlights only one very targeted area. Professional lights highlight whole areas that you want targeted, and the light is spread out to create proper highlights and shadows. They aren’t bright and overwhelming to the eye, but create a more subtle elegant look while serving their purpose of aesthetics, security, and visibility in the dark. Their light is reliable-while solar lights may or may not come on and provide visibility, professional fixtures will. Other factors such as project size, number of fixtures, speciality fixtures (maybe you want some pathway lighting dropped into your concrete or decking, or maybe you want your upper story or gables lit up) also play into the costs of your project. Keep in mind when it comes to lighting fixtures, you get what you pay for: low-end features do not look as good, last as long, and are not as reliable. They will need to be fixed and replaced often and you will ultimately end up spending more in the long run than using higher end fixtures. High end fixtures used by a professional lighting company typically come under a warranty and your installer will replace them if there is an issue. Most professionals will not use lower end fixtures because they cannot stand by their product. Keep in mind when your professional lighting designer gives you his bid, he is paying a high price for well made fixtures that are designed to last that he can stand behind himself. From a labor standpoint, there is a lot more that goes into lighting than just sticking fixtures in the ground and calling it a day. There is hours (sometimes days) spent putting together and strategically placing fixtures, testing them and moving them, installing them which can include concrete and woodwork, climbing unto roofs and second and third stories, burying conduit and wire, installing controllers, etc. For a professional lighting expert to do your job correctly it takes a trained eye, specific skills, attention to detail, and a lot of time and hard work. So what are the costs I should be expecting? With the price of professional high-end fixtures and labor, you can expect to pay around $2000-$3000 for a lower end or smaller project. For a large project with higher end fixtures, a lot of fixtures, or a large home or yard that requires much more lighting, it can run $5000-$6000 or higher. It really depends on the individual project size and what fixtures you want, and how many fixtures your project will take. Keep in mind a few thousand dollars for something that lasts 20-30 years that will increase your home’s value and change it’s appearance dramatically is a project well worth it long-term. Now that I have had time to process my bid and accept this project is goin to cost more than I initially accepted, now what? You can still make your vision a reality! Remember well done professional lighting can increase your home’s value tremendously-up to 15% in some studies. It also increases your security, allows you to increase your time outside in the summer nights, and is just beautiful aesthetically. One thing you can do is start small. Work towards your vision in steps. Divide the project into stages and pay in stages. Secondly, plan ahead. If you wish to start small to save money, plan ahead for what your final project will look like so you can won’t have to dig up areas around flowerbeds or trees later, move conduit or wiring, have the proper number of controllers in place, etc. This will save you materials and labor costs down the road. In the end, it is all worth it. When you finally decide to go for it, it will transform your home and it is a long-term investment into your home. Many people are initially surprised at the cost if they didn’t do their research ahead of time, but NONE of them have regrets after the project is finished. In fact, they are often already planning a new stage to add to it! When you decide you are ready to move forward with your project, or begin your first stage working towards your final goal, we’d love to help you get started and help you design it. Please reach out to Wells Outdoor Allure to make your vision a reality!"
4,Five Things to Consider When Shopping for a Splashback,home," A high-quality splashback can outlast almost anything else in the kitchen. With minimal maintenance, a kitchen splashback can both look great and offer robust protection for countless decades. But how do the different types of splashbacks compare, in terms of performance and potential lifespan? More specifically, what should be prioritised when shopping for a kitchen splashback? Personal preference plays a role, but getting the most out of any kitchen splashback means being mindful of the following: The most important decision you will need to make is that of the splashback’s main material. The two most popular choices are acrylic and glass - both of which have their own unique points of appeal. An acrylic splashback will always be significantly cheaper than a comparable glass splashback. Acrylic can look great, provide effective protection from the surface beneath and have an extensive lifespan. But as acrylic is sensitive to heat, it cannot be placed in close proximity to a heat source. Toughened glass splashbacks are generally considered the gold standard. They can withstand temperatures of up to 300° C, they are exceptionally durable, and they have an indefinite lifespan. In terms of long-term value for money, toughened glass is also the more cost-effective option of the two. Even the sky isn’t the limit where a splashback’s visual appearance is concerned. There are literally limitless options to explore - everything from mirrored splashbacks to those that feature your own custom graphics or photographs. It is entirely up to you whether you go for something bold and outspoken or understated and elegant. Your splashback can blend in seamlessly with its surroundings, or create an eye-catching point of focus for the entire room. Either way, coming up with a unique design for your splashback comes highly recommended. The beauty of bespoke splashbacks design lies in the ability to create something that reflects your unique personality and preferred aesthetic. Kitchen splashbacks are designed to be predominantly maintenance-free.  However, this will be determined by the meticulousness of the original installation process. Fitting a splashback manually is perfectly possible and surprisingly straightforward. That said, it is not a job to be rushed, or to be attempted without the right tools. Splashbacks need to be fitted in a way that creates a flawless watertight seal around the edges. This way, the adhesion between the splashback and the surface will not be compromised by the heat and/or humidity of the kitchen. If in doubt, consider having your splashback installed by the professionals. Another benefit of bespoke splashback design is freedom of choice where shape and size are concerned. There are technically no limitations to how small, large or unusually shaped your splashback can be. You can even arrange for your splashback to be designed with all the custom cut-outs you need in order to accommodate your appliances and switches. This is where a little creativity and innovation can make all the difference. Go for a simple rectangular splashback of a small size if you wish, but consider how a much larger and more creative splashback could transform your kitchen. It is again worth being mindful of the fact that some splashbacks last longer than others. On the surface, a bargain acrylic splashback may seem like the obvious choice. But when considering the indefinite lifespan of a glass splashback, the latter may represent better value for money. Think about where you intend to install your splashback, and the conditions it may be exposed to on a daily basis. Where a splashback is likely to be exposed to rough treatment as is the case across much of the kitchen, a toughened-glass splashback comes highly recommended."
5,How Many Brits Genuinely Understand Food Labels?,home," A recent study conducted by YouGov set out to determine whether Brits really understand the labels on food packaging. As predicted, the results were something of a mixed bag. Increasingly, more consumers than ever before are taking an active interest in what they buy and what they eat. Indications of quality, sustainability and responsibility on product labels are becoming deal-breakers for today’s more conscientious shopper. But what the YouGov study found was that in spite of all this, a surprising proportion of people still do not fully understand what these labels mean. Even where certain labels are recognised by most shoppers, knowing the meaning behind them is another matter entirely. Assumptions and Misinterpretation For example, the British Lion mark, which commonly appears on egg boxes, was the most widely recognised of the six labels the study focused on. But while more than 80% of people said they recognised the label, fewer than 40% knew what it represented. The Red Tractor logo was the second most widely recognised label, familiar to 74% of those it was presented to. This is a mark of quality and traceability, indicating that the product in question can be traced all the way back to its origins. YouGov also revealed that around 70% of shoppers recognised the Fairtrade logo when presented with it. However, comparatively few were familiar with what it means for a product to qualify for Fairtrade certification. 10% believed it indicated a higher quality product, whereas 21% thought Fairtrade primarily concerned sustainability. In reality, Fairtrade is about ensuring farmers and producers are paid a fair price for their products and services. Meanwhile, 61% said that they were familiar with the RSPCA’s ‘Assured’ label, of which 61% knew that this was an indication of higher animal welfare standards. But what was interesting is how many of those who know this RSCPA label assumed that its presence inherently meant that the product in question was free range. As indicated on the RSPCA website, animals raised and products produced indoors can also qualify for this label, if natural daylight conditions are appropriately met. How Labels Affect Shopping Habits The study brings to light an interesting reality, wherein the shopping habits of millions are being influenced by labels they do not fully understand. According to YouGov, more than 25% of Brits actively look for products with the British Lion mark and Red Tractor label, when shopping for everyday essentials. A similar proportion also look for products displaying the MSC ‘Blue Tick’, while around 18% prioritise products with the RSCPA ‘Assured’ logo. Responsibility, sustainability and animal welfare are clearly being prioritised by more shoppers than ever before. Even so, millions are basing their shopping decisions on logos and labels they are misinterpreting. The results of YouGov’s study therefore suggest that brands and businesses looking to present themselves as conscientious and responsible may need to increase their efforts to explain what their labels and claims to fame really mean."
6,Are Blackout Blinds a Good Choice for a Baby’s Nursery?,home," Getting a newborn baby to sleep can be a challenge at the best of times. You sing, you sway, and you swear you are doing everything right, but the baby is still awake and crying. The trouble is, there will always be one factor that is much more difficult to control than others. You can do everything you can to create a relaxing environment, but there is nothing you can do to stop the sun beating down on your home. Creating a dark and relaxing environment for your baby to catch some much-needed sleep is essential; does this mean blackout blinds would be the best choice for your baby’s nursery? If your current curtains or blinds are not getting the job done, would stepping up to blackout blinds make a difference? The Benefits of Blackout Blinds for Better Sleep Understanding how blackout blinds can aid restful sleep means getting to grips with how our sleep cycles work. During the day, exposure to light suppresses the body’s production of the sleep hormone - aka melatonin. This is the hormone that tells your body and brain it is time to be awake, which is why it is much more difficult to relax, unwind and fall asleep in a bright room. Or to put it another way, light is the ultimate energiser for the body and brain, dictating exactly when and for how long you should be sleeping. This would suggest that blackout blinds could be just the thing for aiding restful sleep. Along with helping your little ones get to sleep in the first place, the maintenance of a dark environment could help them stay asleep for longer. When we awake prematurely, we unconsciously check our surroundings. If it’s still dark, the body and brain are lulled back into a sleep state for the time being. If you wake up when it is bright, your body and brain assume it is time to get up; this is something that also applies to babies and kids of all ages. For daytime sleeping purposes, blackout blinds can make a fantastic addition to the home. They can also be great for taking control of day-night cycles during the summer, or where external light pollution is a problem. Not Just for Babies The short answer is therefore yes - blackout blinds are a good choice for a baby’s nursery. Along with providing total control over interior lighting levels, blackout blinds bring several additional benefits into the mix. Examples of which include better energy efficiency through improved heat retention, better blocking of exterior noise, total privacy indoors and an elegantly understated aesthetic. When it comes to the way blackout blinds can aid restful sleep, the same also applies to adults. Even if you have trained yourself to sleep in less than ideal conditions, taking better control over interior lighting could prove beneficial. It’s a scientifically proven fact that human beings sleep better in darker, quieter and more relaxing environments. Not to mention, environments that remain consistent from falling asleep until waking up. Simple, practical and cost-effective, the benefits of blackout blinds go far beyond encouraging restless babies to give you a few precious hours of peace and quiet!"
