Afterwards, plenty of traffic will be generated, and you need to engage with your potential buyers.

However, this is a long process. It takes much effort and plenty of knowledge and skills. it is not impossible to achieve, but it is particularly easier for someone that already have experience in this field, and can provide direct services, without having to learn everything from the basics. Search engines are very complex and have many algorithms. It is often difficult to keep up with everything, but not for someone that does it on a regular basis. Having consistent and unique content definitely improves ranking, especially if it features relevant keywords, topics, and backlinks. Once you collaborate with marketing and SEO agencies, you obtain these great services. Focus on existing content Website content writing services don’t focus on new content, but also optimizing the existing one. Considering that search engine algorithms change constantly, online businesses have outdated content on their platforms, and these eventually affects the rankings. The negative impact on the business is obvious, and soon enough, they find out they don’t have a top position in search results. Agencies that provide website content writing services have a team of SEO professionals that work there, and can take in plenty of tasks, write relevant content for businesses in all fields.

Some believe it is better to hire dedicated personnel, but it is not the case, because not everyone is experienced in digital marketing, and you still need to train them. It will take some time until they are prepared to take over challenging tasks. Perhaps this is a luxury that you cannot afford, and you want everything to happen as soon as possible. Instead, outsourcing services makes more sense. From the minute you sign the contract with the agency, you benefit from their level of expertise, team of specialists, and they will take over the website, analyze it, propose improvements, and focus on other strategies to boost your online presence and grow the business. You don’t have to wait around too much until you see results, and you pay for the desired packages, which means you have better control over costs. Websites that have blog posts and relevant content are better seen by viewers, they have more trust in them, because they get to know more about the business, and about what represents it better. A website that has no quality content, no relevant pictures, does not load fast, and has many bugs, will not be perceived very well by potential buyers, and they will close the pages to look somewhere else for what they seek."
2,A SEO London Agency that Handles Digital Marketing,computers-technology," The online world is the key to the success of a company, but there are quite a few twists and turns along the way. People who want to get the best returns on the resources they invest in the online activity must know how to set their goals and how to achieve them. The best option they have at hand for this purpose is to work with a SEO London agency with knowledge and experience. The First Steps Are not the Only Steps A lot of people are used to investing a certain effort into something and reaping the benefits of their labor at the end. The online world is not the same and there is a lot of work that goes into any online activity. It is important to build a solid website that will represent the interests of the company, but the work is not over when the site is launched. This is just the starting point for it. There are quite a few things that must be done once the site is up and running.

Once it has reached a certain level, it will be a constant struggle to stay at the top. It is not easy to achieve success over the web and it is important to use every bit of help available. Use the Right Methods at the Right Time How can companies make their sites more popular? Popularity over the web will consist of how many people visit the site. The more visitors it will have, the more exposure it will get and the easier it will be to achieve the success the site deserves. Making the right choice is not easy when the knowledge of how the online world works is not as well developed as it should be. When a site is starting out and the main goal is to have as many visitors as possible, pay per click methods can be a solution. This is a solution because it will help search engines see that the site is visited, but this will only happen as long as there is a budget for it. If the funding stops, the clicks will no longer be available and thus the popularity of the company site will also plummet. Even if pay per click is useful at the start, an organic method must be used at the same time. Link building strategies will provide a long lasting solution to improve the popularity of a site. This implies publishing new and original content over the web with links that trace back to the site of the company. This is the best way to achieve success over the web that will last for a long time.

Even if two main online marketing goals are achieved, this does not mean the work is done. Any business relies on sales to generate income and profit, but the number of visitors and the brand name does not guarantee this. They are going to help, but the ultimate goal is to convert visitors into paying customers and a SEO London marketing agency is going to provide the solutions.

3,The Difference Between Biomethane and Biogas,computers-technology," What is the difference between biomethane and biogas? That's a good question and one that is more and more often being asked. So, let's dive in and answer that question. Both are renewable gas derivatives that are produced from the fermentation of discarded organic materials during the anaerobic digestion process. Biogas is produced where anaerobic digestion occurs naturally in landfills and from digesters which are used to reduce the volume of the sludge produced during aerobic sewage treatment. We explain why biogas products cause the emission of fewer greenhouse gas than others. Biomethane is nothing other than biogas which has been purified in a way which removes the impurities (mostly carbon dioxide and water vapour) in the raw biogas output from the digester tank. In fact, biomethane is usually synonymous with ""natural gas"" because it is pressurised and given a calorific value almost identical to natural gas. The only real difference is that natural gas is a fossil fuel and causes climate-changing carbon emissions when it is burnt while in large, in the bigger scheme of things over a 3 to 5-year timescale, biomethane is not. Biomethane is a renewable fuel and can be made in truly sustainable ways. Because biogas and natural gas have the same methane molecule, it can be used in LNG engines among others. Biogas is regarded as being clean during combustion, but LNG is better because it is made up of 99.9% methane and is created from organic waste. Biomethane and its main source which is ""biogas"" are destined to become big players as key components of the energy transition. The energy transition is a pragmatic strategy to move toward reduced greenhouse gas emissions and diversifying energy matrices as soon as possible while using technology already proven to work. Although today, biomethane accounts for only a fraction of natural gas demand, this will grow as more biogas plants are built and commissioned. Generally, in most nations, biomethane suppliers provide biogas at rates below 10% of the available natural gas supply. Nevertheless, this percentage is rising fast. The difference between biogas and biomethane is that the former is produced through the fermentation of biomass, and the latter is the end product after upgrading. The anaerobic decomposition and fermentation of organic matter to produce methane gas is a natural process that has existed for millions of years, before the emergence of fossil fuels. It is nature's way of recycling waste alongside aerobic decomposition. The first human use of biogas dates to at least 3,000 BC, when the Assyrians burned it for baths. Biogas is a renewable fuel that can be used for a variety of purposes, including generating electricity, and heat, and when it has been cleaned-up  as a low air-pollution transport fuel. In the United States, biogas is mainly extracted from where it is produced in landfills, and from the anaerobic treatment of livestock manure on livestock farms. About 90% of biogas produced in the US comes from landfills unti;l 2020. In the United States, however, biomethane is also produced from agricultural waste from large farms. In fact, livestock carbon emissions account for one-third of the US nation's methane emissions. Due to state and federal support, the United States is the global leader in the use of biomethane for transport. Biomethane is an energy-rich gas that is created during the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. It is composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide. In its raw form, biogas may contain between forty and sixty percent methane and only small amounts of water vapour and other gases. After undergoing refinement, biogas can be used as a substitute for conventional natural gas. While biogas and biomethane have similar qualities, there are some differences between them. Biogas generally contains more hydrogen than biomethane but because of the other impurities present, it is not usually seen as being compatible with conventional fuels. Biogas has the same methane molecule as natural gas, so it can be used in LNG engines. Because it is 99.9% methane, biogas is considered cleaner than LNG and is produced from organic matter. Biogas also emits fewer greenhouse gases. In addition to being the raw material for producing biomethane, biogas also has some benefits. But biomethane wins out as experience in biomethane plant ownership it can help prevent emissions throughout the value chain. Biogas is produced naturally in an atmosphere-controlled environment. In addition to reducing fossil fuel use, biomethane also produces biofertiliser, which returns organic carbon back to the soil. That process also helps reduce the need for mineral fertilisers. These are all positive steps in a sustainable energy supply chain. The use of organic materials in biomethane production improves hygienic conditions in rural areas. The process also decreases the risk of watercourse pollution. Biogas and biomethane contributes to the economy of rural communities and preserves nature. There are many similarities between biogas and biomethane, and a better understanding of their different roles will help you make a decision on the best option for your needs. A common biogas upgrade involves the use of a scrubber. It captures the biogas produced by anaerobic digestion and removes the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) present in it. By injecting air into the scrubber tank, the bacteria oxidise the H2S compound further and convert it to elemental sulfur. Some common methods of removing hydrogen sulphide (H2S) from biogas include introducing some air/oxygen to the digester biogas which is added using lagoon aerators and adding iron chloride to the feed slurry."
4,5 Popular Types of Web Hosting Services Explained,computers-technology," Multiple websites can use a same server with shared hosting. Typically, you will have no idea who or what websites are sharing a server's resources with you. Each client often has a restriction on the overall amount of server resources that they may use, however this is determined by your hosting package. Shared hosting is perhaps the most cost-effective and inexpensive option for your needs. However, the low price comes with some limitations, which we'll discuss further below. Because most hosting firms provide the same amount of space and storage, it's critical to select a business you can rely on. Advantages of Shared Hosting Shared hosting is by far the most affordable hosting option. Most hosting firms offer different tiers of hosting, so you may gradually improve your hosting service. As a result, shared hosting is ideal for launching a website. Shared hosting often has a built-in cPanel that is simple to use and maintain. Shared hosting is an excellent choice for website owners on a tight budget. Disadvantages of Shared Hosting Shared hosting is inexpensive and simple to administer even without technical knowledge. However, it has several downsides. The load time might be sluggish, and the server can get overcrowded due to other sites using the same server. When your website begins to receive more traffic, you will notice that the load speed of your website becomes noticeably slower, and now is the time to improve. Shared hosting lacks specific choices for optimising your website's performance. VPS web hosting is a newer form of web hosting that has just recently gained popularity. Virtual Private Server (VPS) is an acronym for it. Many individuals and businesses seeking a web host for their Internet endeavours are bewildered by VPS hosting. Because it is a hybrid of shared and dedicated hosting, this is the case. A virtual private server has its own operating system, storage space, and bandwidth. A physical server in a data centre used for VPS hosting is separated into different areas, each of which creates its own virtual server. The server administrator sees just their virtual environment and may utilise or reboot the server as if it were their own dedicated server. Many hosting customers prefer VPS hosting because they have more control over their environment than shared hosting. VPS hosting is a suitable beginner option for consumers who desire dedicated hosting but are unsure about the technological know-how required. They can try it out and expand their skill set without having to invest as much money up front. Advantages of Virtual Private Server (VPS) A virtual private server (VPS) may be configured to perform optimally for your website. Because of the more advanced settings, a company that uses managed VPS will immediately see hosting benefits such as enhanced performance. A VPS is normally more expensive than shared hosting, but it is not more expensive than dedicated hosting. A high-performance VPS is not much more expensive than most shared hosting options. It is easy to understand why a VPS is a much better bargain. In terms of security, VPS is more secure than shared hosting since it has a closed environment with no shared resources. For example, if a virus infects any of the websites housed on a shared network, it may quickly traverse the directory structure and infect everything in its path. Disadvantages of Virtual Private Server (VPS) Virtual private server hosting are usually more expensive than shared hosting. While the cost is greater, you receive more bang for your buck when compared to shared hosting. Dedicated servers are frequently regarded as the best web hosting solution. This is because you get a lot more benefits with dedicated hosting, such as greater uptime and faster speeds. On the other side, dedicated servers are the most expensive type of web hosting. Websites that are hosted on a dedicated server have complete control over the server setup. You have the option of selecting your favourite software and customisations. If you buy a dedicated server, you should expect it to have an extremely high uptime and lightning-fast loading rates. You will never have to worry about other websites' traffic interfering with the operation of your website. However, a high degree of technical skill is necessary for the server's installation and ongoing operation. Advantages of Dedicated Servers Dedicated servers are one of the most reliable and stable hosting. It guarantees that you are not sharing your space with a malicious software or a spammer. Dedicated servers give more security, which is why they are necessary for firms that undertake FTP or SSL transactions. Dedicated server hosting usually includes a 24x7 support team to deal with technical issues to ensure high uptimes. One of the most often held beliefs about dedicated hosting is that you have complete control over your server. As the site admin you can custom all the tools and applications, as long as the hosting provider supports them. Disadvantages of  Dedicated Servers To maintain a dedicated server, you must have strong technical knowledge and be able to troubleshoot any technological difficulties that arise. This might be time-consuming at times. You will also need to employ an expert to address these problems at times. As a result, maintenance expenses will be substantially greater than with shared hosting. Cloud hosting is a server and network architecture that divides a single physical server into several virtual servers using software. These devices are frequently referred to as virtual machines. To suit their daily demands, businesses have begun to migrate to cloud hosting. These servers may be used for a variety of purposes, including web hosting, application development, and remote-accessible desktop work environments. Unlike typical shared hosting, Cloud Hosting allots dedicated resources to each Cloud Server, rather than vying for computing resources among many distinct users' websites and apps. Each Cloud Server is given a partitioned disk with storage space that can only be accessed from inside their own operating instance. Each server is given a set quantity of RAM and CPU cores. In addition to the resources you pay for, your Cloud Server might burst to utilise more resources during off-peak hours. Advantages of Cloud Hosting One of the primary reasons why businesses are shifting to cloud hosting is because it is more cost-effective than on-premise technology. Companies would have to pay money on disks or other storage devices, as well as an IT crew to manage these equipment, with traditional hosting. However, with cloud hosting, you just pay the provider from whom you are purchasing the resources. This saves the firm resources, money, and time. Disadvantages of Cloud Hosting One of the most serious difficulties with Cloud hosting may be security vulnerabilities that may develop if a person without technical understanding attempts to utilise the service. To take use of the service, you will constantly require technical help. Because cloud hosting firms share resources, this might be another source of security concerns. A colocation hosting solution is comparable to dedicated hosting in that it provides several methods to improve your website and its resources. It is safe and dependable, but you will need some technical understanding to get the most out of it. Colocation does not employ the hosting company's servers; instead, you purchase or rent all of your own gear and software and place it in a data centre. Colocation hosting is appropriate for high-traffic websites. Colocation hosting is also appropriate for beginning hosting firms who have not yet built their own data centre. When you choose colocation hosting, you have significantly greater protection than with other types of hosting, as well as total control and flexibility over the hardware and software. Advantages of Colocation Hosting When it comes to network security, colocation hosting is always the best option. This is because data centres contain top-tier network security, such as the most recent firewalls or intrusion detection systems, to identify and block unauthorised network access. Colocation hosting also provides power redundancy through the use of several power grids, diesel generators, double battery backup systems, and good maintenance procedures. It enables you to extend your infrastructure to meet the demands of your company's expansion without incurring capital expenses. Disadvantages of Colocation Hosting Colocation hosting requires a greater initial investment in both hardware and software, as well as upgrades and maintenance in terms of time or resources."
5,5 Most Common Http Errors Explained,computers-technology," This is the most typical error message encountered by online users. This is a generic error that might occur whenever a web server encounters an internal problem. Error 500 is most commonly seen when the web hosting server is overcrowded. You can resolve this error message by refreshing the page, clearing your your browser's cache, removing all of your web browser's cookies, or restarting the web browser. If you get this problem on your website, contact your web hosting provider; if it's a wordpress website, it might be a conflict with one of your third-party plugins. Try deleting these plugins one by one to in the cPanel to verify which is the one that casing the conflict. A 401 unauthorised error is a http status code message that often occurs when a user tries to visit an unauthorised website or after an unsuccessful login attempt to an unauthorised website. The webmaster normally protects these unauthorised websites with a password using cPanel. This error message indicates that something went wrong with your web browser in response to your request. This usually signifies that the data transmitted by the browser does not follow the rules of the http protocol. The server is unable to handle a request with incorrect syntax. This might indicate that the user's internet connection is unreliable, that there is a security vulnerability inside the operating system, that there is a caching issue, or that the browser is malfunctioning. If you try to enter a restricted directory on a web browser, you will encounter this error notice, which indicates that there is no login option on the page. The most typical reason a user would receive this error message is if the website does not allow users to browse the site's file directory structure or if the individual file requested is not allowed to be accessed via the web. You may enable 403 protection on your own site for security purposes by masking the directory structure or files that contain susceptible information. This is a fantastic technique to safeguard your site from being hacked. Although many web servers provide this feature by default, you may add an extra security layer to your site by opening your cPanel account, navigating to the Advanced menu box, and selecting Index Manager. By selecting 'No Indexing' on the directory you desire to protect, you may customise how your users view a certain directory on your website. A 404 not found error message will show whenever a user attempts to visit a non-existent web page. This warning is typically displayed when a user exits the browser, presses the stop button, or clicks on a link too rapidly - however, it may also occur when a file is excessively big or a server is working too slowly. You have most certainly encountered a 404 error when exploring the web. If the server cannot discover anything on the requested location, a 404 message will be shown. This is frequently due to a mistyped URL, but it can also occur when users attempt to access deleted or temporarily inaccessible pages. You should try to decrease the amount of 404s on your website as much as possible because they will almost always boost your bounce rate. It should be observed that the 404 message and the 410 error page are quite similar. While both show that the server was unable to locate the requested file, the 410 implies that this is a permanent condition, implying that the resource was most likely purposely rendered inaccessible."

7,How De-Packaging Equipment Can Benefit Your Food Waste Business,computers-technology," If you produce, or receive and wish to pre-treat an organic waste such as food waste and are interested in de-packaging equipment, then you are in the right place. In this article, we will discuss how de-packaging equipment can benefit your business. If you are considering investing in de-packaging equipment, you need to consider several factors. In addition to the equipment's performance, it's also important to consider the cost and maintenance. Below are some of the key merits of de-packaging equipment plus we list a selection of manufacturers. Hammermill-based De-packagers The first de-packaging machines were based on the hammermill that is often used in wood-processing operations. This process separates the packaging from the food by smashing it up under that action of the rotating hammers in the mill. Newer models are designed to separate packaging while using minimal force. They use fine adjustments to the angle of small paddles or plates mounted on a rotating shaft. Once separated, the separated packaging is conveyed out of the machine in two output streams. These are the organic fraction or ""pulp"" which has the consistancy of a thick soup, and the reject stream. Paddle Based De-packagers Other models use paddles but these can also berak up the various materials of the packaging very small especially when combined with a shredder. Inevitably this also creates a lot of small plastic pieces known as microplastics. Microplastics are increasingly being recognised as a hazard to the environment, and are also getting into our bodies and are found in human blood. Food-waste De-packaging Machines Large and Small Food-waste de-packaging machines all provide a process that separates organic and inorganic waste from packaging. The types of packaging processed and the rates of generation of this waste vary enormously. Although the manufacturers supply a range of depackager sizes the rate of processing may vary depending on the exact nature of the organic waste.  Despite being available in many types and capacities the manufacturer may suggest configuring their machines with special modifications and many suppliers offer modular systems enabling the addition of further process units for subsequent settlement, for sand and grit removal, and/ or for example a strainer/ dewatering stage. Scott Equipment Company For example, one de-packaging machine, the Scott Equipment Company's model T42 Turbo Separator, can process anywhere from 10 to 30 tons of packaged food waste per hour. It has 56 flat paddles that work together to split, separate, and convey the waste. Organic materials are collected and conveyed to holding areas, while inorganic wastes are pumped into a compactor. These machines use rotating paddles and flails to break open packages. The MEGA-THOR has a capacity of 40 tons per hour. TWISTER De-packagers and Separators These models allow for the separation of organic materials from packaging and Twister has been credited with supplying one of the best de-packaging systems on the market. They are capable of recovering 90% or more of the materials inside the packaging and may satisfy the Swedish inert content standard. They can even separate sticky solids, which are difficult to remove from the packets and wrappers. An optional screw press can dewater the rejected packaging. The best model to choose depends on the size of your project. And be sure to check with the manufacturer for any warranties and technical support. Atritor Turbo Separators The Atritor TS3096 is capable of separating wet and dry materials, handling both wet and dry waste. Avoiding the need to add water can be essential for an efficient waste-to-energy-plant. Customer feedback has attested to the fact that the Atritor they bought enabled the company to expand its vehicle fleet bring in more organic waste and invest in an even bigger de-packaging system. Tiger DePack Machines Designed for efficient and productive operation, Tiger DePack machines are ideal for processing food waste. They are the front-end of the AD process and offer excellent throughput capabilities. Blue Group, the supplier of Tiger Depack machines, has an excellent support network. They are also available from stock in the UK, making it a crucial part of your de-packaging plant's uptime and efficiency. Brask Xtractor An advanced piece of waste-management equipment, the Brask Xtractor depaks packaged liquids. It is good at separating the liquid from the solid materials and is also described as highly durable and maintenance-free. The Dominator The Dominator is credited with being able to handle wet or dry metal tin can products. It can even separate plastic bottles. Mavitec The Mavitec depackaging machine is a horizontal shaft-based machine with paddles and flails mounted on it. The angle of the paddles can be adjusted to accommodate the feedstock. The machine rotates at approximately 800 rpm. The capacity of the Mavitec depackaging machine depends on the complexity of depackaging. This equipment will remove 99.9% of the organic material from the packaging and will be a great benefit to the county."
8,Email Spoofing - What Is It & How to Protect Yourself,computers-technology," Email Spoofing – What Is It & How to Protect Yourself Within days of being hired, a new employee in our accounting department received an email from our CEO asking them to place an order for much needed equipment.  Excited to be part of the team and show responsiveness our new champion almost fell victim to a growing type of cyberattacks. The email seemed appropriate and looked legitimate – we were just a few clicks away from being hacked and compromised by a spoofed email.  This wasn’t the first time we received a suspicious message.  In fact, cybersecurity experts say attacks are up 300% in this past year. What is email spoofing? Email spoofing is a technique used by hackers to trick you into thinking a message came from a person or organization you know or trust – most commonly your CEO or colleague, though often vendors or brands. Can you tell the difference between paypal.com and paypaI.com? Spoofed emails look legitimate – often creating a sense of urgency or need for action.  If pretending to be from someone in your organization, commonly from a person of authority but could be a peer.  If from an external source, even clicking links in them take you to landing pages that look just like the real vendors landing page (branding, logos, layout, etc.) – put next to the real site, they look nearly identical. Email spoofing statistics •	Over 3 billion domain spoofing emails are sent each day •	More than 90% of cyberattacks start with an email message •	43% of cyber attacks target small and medium sized businesses •	69% of hackers say they were never detected by a company’s security measures •	It takes over 6-months on average to detect a breach (they’re in your business for a long time) How to prevent from being spoofed During a recent Cybersecurity Insurance webinar, local experts discussed steps to drastically reduce the risk of being compromised and shared recommended actions to take if you receive a suspicious email.  As Steve Szubinski, president of PCA Technology Group shared, it’s all about layers of protection. Enable Multi-Factor authentication (MFA).  Microsoft 365 includes MFA with the service; however, it is turned off by default.  If you are not sure it has been enabled for your company, contact your trusted IT provider.  According to Microsoft, MFA can block over 99.9 percent of account compromise attacks.  While MFA won’t prevent you from receiving a disguised malicious email, any compromised accounts will be difficult to use. Enable External Email Notification.  When this service is enabled with your Microsoft 365 subscription, a notification banner will appear across the top of any email that originated outside your company.  In the case of our new employee in the accounting department, it would have been obvious that the email did not come from our CEO. Cybersecurity User Awareness Training.  1 out of every 3 people would fall for a spoofing email without regular training.  Effective programs require at minimum annual training.  PCA offers complimentary sessions each month - check our Events page for dates & times.  Tools such as KnowBe4 have proven to reduce the risk to less than 5%. Confirm Requests.  Our attorney partners recommend that you always confirm requests via phone prior to taking any action asked in an email.  Do not follow the instructions in the message, rather use the phone numbers and web address you know for your colleagues, vendors, and customers. If you think an email is suspicious Contact your IT team or your IT service provider, even if the email is urgent or time sensitive.  They will verify if it is legitimate and can even move the email to a “sandbox” where it will not be able to impact your organization.  Fear you already clicked something potentially harmful, turn off your computer and contact IT support. Cyber insurance providers like Lawley Insurance require organizations to have proper protocols in place so employees know what to do if they suspect an attack.  Organizations should have a physical copy of their insurance policy handy along with a physical copy of their incident response plan.  The plans should clearly identify who is responsible for managing an incident and who is responsible for communications – both internal and external communications.  There are legal reasons your company should call a potential threat an incident until it has been verified truly as an attack. Take these straightforward steps to significantly reduce your risk Proactive measures will protect you from costs of business interruptions, data or financial loss, and reputation threats. •	Talk with your IT provider and ensure your layers of cyber security are working for you, •	Ensure all staff at your company attend regular cybersecurity user awareness trainings (consider a service like KnowBe4 for added protection), •	Review your cyber insurance policy with your provider, plus •	Update your Incident Response Plan and prepare your team to follow it when needed. Unsure of your organization’s overall cybersecurity posture, use a Free Cybersecurity Self-Assessment Tool like the one available on PCA's Cybersecurity page or contact our experienced team at info@pcatg.com (by phone at 716.632.5881)."
9,Reasons Of Why Bangladeshi Businesses Need To Redesign Their Websites,computers-technology," Websites are digital representations of businesses, and if they are properly presented, they can bring you extra business and build your reputation. Isn't it worthwhile to invest in a website that leaves a great first impression? Every Bangladeshi business owner will at some point realize that they need a professional website for their business, a website designed by an experienced team of professionals. You Reflect Your Company's Identity Through Your Website Stanford University researchers found that 75% of people judge a business's credibility by its website alone. As a result, your website should be mobile-friendly, easy-to-use, up-to-date, visually pleasing, and represent you and your brand well. Optimize It For The Search Engines Is your website having trouble ranking on Google's first two pages? This may be due to outdated SEO on your website. The SEO landscape is constantly evolving since Google's algorithms are updated daily. In that case, it may be hurting instead of helping you if you haven't updated your SEO for quite some time. You can remedy this by redesigning your website. You will be more likely to rank in the first two pages of Google if you redesign your website and improve its SEO. Being one of Bangladeshi top SEO agencies, Online Solutions has the know-how and expertise to improve your SEO. Mobile Responsive Website Over 82 percent of internet users in Bangladeshi and the world own and regularly use smartphones. Having a mobile-friendly website is, therefore, more important now than ever before, and if your website does not provide the functionality to function on a mobile device, you may be losing customers. Your website may not be mobile-friendly even if it was built 5 years ago. A large number of users (61%), who cannot use a mobile site properly, leave the site and go to a competitor's site. If you want to keep 61% of site visitors, you need a mobile-friendly site. If you don't? Redesign it. User-Friendly & Easy-to-Navigate Mentioned at the beginning of the blog that your business' website is often the first thing customers will see - so you want to make sure that they have a positive experience with it. A good and easy layout page structure and Solid navigation Good presentation, easy to read information, common keywords Stand-out media and images Brand consistency and messaging There is a lot of meaning to details - and if you add all of them up they add up to a lot. Users are trying to stay on your page for as long as possible, so your description could determine whether someone stays on your site longer, or whether they leave right away. Ensure It Is Up To Date When compared to a competitor's website that might be more up-to-date, even a three to a four-year-old website might appear outdated. Using simple patterns with clean, modern lines is the latest design trend for 2021/2022. This look can be applied to mobile devices as well as desktop. Companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Starbucks, etc. have incorporated these design elements. Unlike other countries where competition is fierce, Bangladeshi does not have as much of it, so being on top of it gives you an advantage. Extend Your Services And Capabilities On Your Website Your website must reflect whether your services or your business have grown or changed. Because they aren't aware you offer the service, they will go elsewhere to find it. Customers in Bangladeshi will not have trouble finding a competitor. A redesigned website allows you to clearly explain what services you offer, so that customers and visitors will know what services you don't provide. Update Your Website With Greater Control What if you could update your website yourself every time you offered a new service? Additionally, you can start marketing campaigns at any time and you do not need to wait for someone to change it. The back-end of websites become more user-friendly every year, so updating and changing an old website can prove challenging. The Loading Time Improve Are you aware that 47% of consumers expect web pages to load within 2 seconds of clicking? Furthermore, if the web page takes longer than 3 seconds to load, approximately 40% of visitors will leave the website completely. When your website loads slowly, you risk losing potential customers by the second, while also suffering from poor SEO. Improve Website Security Cybersecurity is one of the foremost concerns of today's digital world, perhaps even the greatest. If businesses fail to update their websites, they are vulnerable to hacks and viruses. Websites that are older are more vulnerable. Third-Party Plugins Many third-party plugins and tools get outdated, particularly if the owner of the website doesn't maintain their own site and doesn't provide ongoing support to the builders. They often have a difficult time using them, or they frequently fail to work, resulting in your website being abandoned eventually."
10,Agile fantasies and harsh business realities,computers-technology," Chronicles from the trenches. Nowadays digital transformation programmes are invariably associated with Agile.  Organizations want to become Agile since they want to increase speed, efficiency, effectiveness, etc. and Agile promises to deliver all that. However, what typically happens on the ground is the quick adoption of a number of Agile ceremonies and tools (the likes of standing crowds in some open space corner, yellow stickers based Kanban boards, the ever present Jira, etc.) and the sweeping away of any deeper organization analysis, let alone alignment. In that sense Agile is remarkably similar to religions. Typically most religions have an exterior part, (i.e. their prescriptive side: Going to the functions at a specific day, do not eat certain food, kneel down at certain moments of the function, etc.) and a substantial or moral part (i.e. behave in a certain way, etc.). The exterior part is far easier to be adopted and “implemented” and usually ends up being identified with the religion itself. Similarly, from the IT trenches you can easily see that most organization cannot even get near at the substantial part of Agile: They just adopt its choreography. The overall result often materializes in a number of recurring anti-patterns that are remarkably repetitive across organizations, and invariably introduce even more inefficiencies and waste. The purpose of this brief article is to provide some insights about some of the reasons why this happens and what are the watch-outs. Basically, far from being tout court derogatory of Agile, this article simply aims at pointing out its many fake implementations, and in doing so, it truly follows one of the Agile key principles, i.e. the one that preaches the need of paying attention to lessons learned and to incorporate remediation actions going forwards. Below is the relevant principle quoted verbatim: “At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly”. So why not reflecting on how Agile is typically deployed into organizations for real? The first and foremost observation is that a so called digital transformation almost invariably involves the construction of a distributed solution or a set of solutions. That is: a solution that is made of a number of components that are required to interoperate seamlessly, some to be built from scratch, some already exiting to be modified/enhanced. In essence, there will be the need of building a UI layer (either native mobile or hybrid or web-responsive) that connects to an ecosystem of APIs (also typically to be largely built) that in turn will provide access to a layer of legacy systems of records typically via a number of different types of connectors. So far there is no rocket science.  However, the scope of what needs be done is typically far larger than the scope that a pizza-size team can crack, in a self-contained and self-organized mode. And the latter implies that a couple of cornerstone Agile principles break down just to start with. Further to that, such a big and complex scope would require, as a mean of technical coordination, an upfront elaboration of architecture (i.e. an engineering focused solution design) that in turn does require some clarity about requirements. And the devil is always in the details: Requirements do not make any exception. Here, on the requirements elaboration front, is where the first and very evident failure typically happens. Agile is almost invariably associated with user stories as the format to collect requirements.  And most of the time what gets produced is a set of high-level hollow statements, almost never mutually exclusive nor exhaustive, that nobody is really able to make sense of, let alone architects or developers, who almost never really bother to read these small sentences in their hundreds. And indeed, in fairness, Agile preaches that user stories are not meant to describe functionalities, but rather serve as placeholders for the self-contained and self-organized team to pick them up and further elaborate them (via team communication) to produce all the required details whilst progressing into their implementation.  Something that might work only in a self-contained and small team. So the first failure is requirements. I have seen or heard of programmes that after many months haven’t yet managed to produce any satisfactory description (i.e. with a meaningful level of detail) of the WHAT, in other terms of the functional requirements end-to-end. Meanwhile the architecture teams, sometimes organized into separate work-streams, each focused on specific  ‘views’ of the whole distributed architecture (i.e. data, security, integration, etc.) engage in rather lengthy and  unfocused debates on potentially needed new capabilities, failing though to converge into a real solution design that the engineering team can read, understand and implement. As implied by its subtitle, this brief article is meant to report experiences collected from the trenches; hence it is not my intention here to delve into a detailed analysis of the various remediation I myself have put forward or seen adopted with success. Its goal is rather to highlight recurring anti-patterns with the aim of awakening pitfalls awareness especially in those non-technical stakeholders who often are the decision makers, so to help them to surely recognize whether their programme has fallen in the same anti-pattern. And believe you me, the level of noise typically coming up from any one’s organization is such that it is very difficult to understand what is really going on at ground level, despite the many reports that are usually produced, all looking very professional, polished and often really impressive from a graphical point of view. So what is the main symptom of such not-so-uncommon anti-pattern? In other terms: how do you recognise that your programme has got stuck at the rather basic level of requirements gathering and elaboration? What do you need to probe to assess whether that is really the case? Naturally enough you would need to check the artefact(s) used to document the agreed requirements and read them to assess if they describe with enough clarity and comprehensiveness what the solution will do in front of its specified category of user.  The latter used to be called an actor and still is within the UML formalism. In other more mundane terms, and assuming, as typically is the case, that your distributed solution starts with a UI (either mobile or web) you should be looking that the requirement clearly describes the sequence of screens, and for each screen its input fields together with associated validation rules, its combo boxes together with its associated choices and action buttons). Also, very importantly, look to see if the relevant server-side calls are described in correspondence of any event or user action that can happen on the specific screen. A server-side call should be documented with a logical name, together with its input and output parameters (again documented at a logical level) and a brief description of what it is required to do from a UI (or front-end ) perspective, again in business terms. There is nothing technical in here. Requirement is about describing what the UI should be doing from a user point of view, both in terms of screen interactions and calls it (i.e. the UI) generates to perform business operations. The reading should be sequentially-friendly. That is the document should be amenable to be read sequentially, from the first to the last page, and, page after page, the reader should get ever more convinced that the ground is covered comprehensively and exhaustively with no gaps or vagueness and it makes sense. This suggestion might look trivial and old-fashion. However, if after months, there is no such description available (with the quality attributes I have just alluded to) it means requirements gathering is still all over the places and your programme has fallen in that not-so-uncommon anti-pattern. Better still: the same exercise can be organized by leveraging independent judges with clearly defined instructions on how to perform the assessment so to assure objectiveness as much as possible. And, if beforehand, a requirement template would have been defined with extreme care and attention (as I often recommend) this kind of programme’s progress measurement would be far easier to execute with reliability. Assessing whether the requirements elaboration process has produced the expected results is important though often overlooked. Requirement is often where most of the digital transformation programmes risk to be wrecked, though that is not widely recognised."
11,The development of warfare cyberspace in the United States of America. By Giancarlo Elia Valori.,computers-technology," Weapons and equipment are the foundation of military combat capability and an important factor in determining the outcome of wars. In the current situation of increasingly fierce competition among major powers and of increasingly evident militarization of cyberspace, all countries have increased capital investment; strengthened the development and deployment of cyberspace weapons and equipment; promoted research and development, as well as transformation, and application of emerging technologies; and sought to shape new technologies for military development and future operations. As a concept for integrating cyberwarfare systems, the US Cyber Command created the Joint Cyber Operations Architecture (JCWA) to guide cyberwarfare acquisition and investment decisions, with the aim of enabling cyber forces to execute command and control decisions, as well as training in having access - through a unified platform - to the broad tasks of the system. Since 2021 the US military has continued to use the JCWA as a guide and rely on various services to develop and improve cyberwarfare systems and tools. The JCWA includes several acquisition programs, as well as cyber tools and sensors to support cyber operations. According to the US Defense Department's 2022 budget, the U.S. Air Force is responsible for requesting to the Joint Cyber Command and Control (JCC2) a budget of 79 million dollars, more than double the previous year's 38.4 million dollars due to a number of programs, including the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) project. i.e. an artificial intelligence-enabled tool that will provide a new way for cyber forces to understand the common operational framework in warfare. Funds will be transferred to the project, and the IKE software development has moved from the planning to the execution phase. The US Air Force is responsible for the Unified Platform (UP) for fiscal year 2022. The research and development budget is equal to 101.8 million dollars. The US Army will also be responsible for the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) research and development budget for fiscal year 2022, which amounts to 52.9 million dollars. The budget for the US Army's Joint Common Access Platform (JCAP) has so far been kept secret. The US Army offered the PCTE, version 3, in the second quarter of 2021, following the release of version 2 to the US Cyber Command in October 2020. The PCTE version 3 will provide users with additional response channels and give training managers an overview of the network status. It will also include a content repository to host previous scenarios built by content or training curators. This makes it easier to train or simulate the activities. Security Insider (https://www.secrss.com/) says that the US Army plans to deploy and distribute version 4 of the PCTE platform to the U.S. Cyber Command in the first quarter of this year. The version provides a more intuitive engine for discovering training activities, exercises or modules available to troops, designed to reduce redundancy and enable better individual and team training. The Army also continues to lead the Cyber Innovation Challenge to award contracts and apply new technologies to the PCTE platform. The latest contract, awarded in February 2021, includes ""enhanced assessment"" and ""traffic generation"" features and functionalities that will be incorporated into version 5 of the PCTE. The ""enhanced assessment"" is critical to the US Cyber Command, as it helps improve force readiness reports. On the other hand, the ""traffic generation"" is also a key capability that helps cyber forces in areas including ""friendly space,"" ""grey space"" and ""red space,"" operating in the entire IT and intelligence environment, not just in certain networks. In June 2021 the main annual US Cyber Command exercise, i.e. Cyber Flag 21-2, used the PCTE platform again, thus enabling the US Cyber Command to expand the exercise of activities. The PCTE team is applying the exercise readings to future events for subsequent versions of the platform. The PCTE and project team have developed studies to support and monitor thousands of daily events - even the most insignificant - and make them available to the other major Cyber Yankee service as well. The US Army is also exploring the PCTE integration with other JCWA components to enable the interoperability of the US cyber mission forces. The above integration not only reduces access and accounts for multiple systems, but also seamlessly feeds data response to the combat platform. For example, the US armed forces are conducting initial pilot work to enter and incorporate the PCTE data into the JCC2-Project IKE component. The Pentagon formally handed Project IKE over to the US Cyber Command in April 2021 and it is serving as a reference point for key cyber tools for its cyber mission force. The IKE project is considered a precursor to the JCC2, one of the pillars of the JCWA, available to the US Cyber Command. The JCC2 seeks to integrate data from a variety of sources to help inform and support commanders' decision-making; assess readiness down to the individual level; visualize cyberspace and give situational awareness to all levels of combat forces. The IKE project enables users throughout the chain of command to plan, prepare, execute, and evaluate cybersecurity operations. IKE will be used to map the network and assess the readiness of cyber teams and command forces in cyberspace. IKE enables commanders to understand the status of offensive and defensive teams, as well as friendly and enemy forces in cyberspace, which is critical to its command and control, and to ensure the dissolution of crises in conflicts between combat teams. IKE is already used by the US combat troops and currently has thousands of military users. The US Cyber Command plans to migrate its various service network components to the JCAP. It will provide it with the infrastructure for offensive missions by fiscal year 2024. Service cyber forces will move on crisis platforms, using the separate tools that now operate proactively, and link their respective cyberspace activities more closely. The Army plans to withdraw its current offensive cyber tools in 2024 and then move to the JCAP. The Army is developing the tool for the U.S. Cyber Command and the Army, which will be deployed in four joint mission operations commands: the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps, which have already signed a memorandum of understanding. The JCAP uses an innovative software acquisition approach and the system is updated quarterly to add new functionalities, thus giving the Army the freedom to continue to repeat and gradually add more functionalities to the system itself. In December 2020 Mattel Technologies announced it had been awarded a 265 million US dollar contract to support the project over 42 months. Furthermore, the US Army awarded a 2.4 billion US dollar contract to 14 companies to provide IT services for the national cyber range complex. The companies will provide incident planning and execution, site safety and security, IT management and range modernization services, as well as operational support for the military in cyber missions. The National Cyber Range is therefore a US Army program focused on improving battlefield resilience by creating an operationally representative cyberspace environment for respective mission testing, training and simulations. As part of the Capability Set 21, the Army plans to implement a tool called Cyber Situational Awareness to prepare units for combat as early as this year. Cyber Situational Awareness is a tool designed specifically for commanders on the ground, not intended for use in cyberspace operations, but to help commanders better perceive cyber and electromagnetic situations to make more informed decisions."
12,Computer Operating System Used in Laptops and Desktops,computers-technology," Operating system is the program that runs a computer or laptop. In this article, I will discuss what is an operating system and its versions. I will also discuss who wrote these operating systems. All computers including desktops and laptops use special codes of instructions that dictates the device how to work and process information. These instructions are put together in one program called the operating system. Whether it’s from Apple for their Mac computers or Microsoft or Google, they do the same job that is to run the device. There are two operating systems that are popular these days, one is Mac OS X from Apple Company and the other one is Windows from Microsoft. They both mostly use them in desktop computers and laptops. Microsoft offered a few operating systems in the last two decades. They started with DOS (disk operating system). They offered a few versions in DOS. After DOS, they moved to graphical interface with the introduction of windows. This Windows was very basic. Later on they moved to Windows 95 and then Windows 98. Windows 98 was very successful and kind of smooth version. After Windows 98, they introduced Windows 2000 and Windows ME. Windows 2000 was better version than Windows ME. Windows ME was in the market for a short period of time because of its low popularity. Microsoft then came up with the most reliable version of all previous operating systems known as Windows XP. This operating system was very users and applications friendly. Microsoft introduced some good features in it. The top utility in the list was the system restore utility. With system restore, users could restore a previous good version of the OS in case there was a problem with the operating system. This operating system had one bad feature where it would not load (when moving hard drive from broken computer to a good computer) on another pc in case there was a hardware failure unless an advance repair install could be done successfully. This was a time when Microsoft learned writing better operating systems because the next one they came up was even more reliable. This was Windows 7. This Windows ran for a while until they moved to Windows 10. In Windows 10, they changed the design big time more and made it like a tablet friendly operating system. A lot of users had problems moving from Windows 7 to 10 because due to relocation of the menus and links where users now have to search for features or links. For example, if a user wants to go to Windows update settings, they have to search it instead of looking for the menu. They also removed the start menu which was a convenient way to access many features. Their latest operating system called Windows 11 is based on Windows 10. They added a new launch bar at the bottom of the screen. Apple also have a few operating systems for their devices including desktops and laptops. Their Mac desktop includes iMac, Mac mini, ipad, Mac Pro and laptops are Macbook, Macbook Pro, Macbook Air, Macbook Pro Retina etc. They started with their operating system OS X 10 Kodiak in 2000. They used it in their non-Intel computers. Then they came with up cheetah, puma and Panther and then Tiger. Around 2005, 2006 they had to move from IBM processor to Intel. This era was the beginning of a marathon for them. This was the time when they introduced Leopard and Snow Leopard. In the beginning, users were not accepting to switch to Mac because there were a lot of compatibility issues with most of the applications. All third party applications were fully compatible with windows operating system. With the passage of time, third party developers started to write apps for OS X. By the time Apple introduced Lion and mountain lion apps were slowly getting compatible with OS X. In 2013 Apple came up with Mavericks and then Yosemite in 2014. This was the time, most applications were being written for OS X. This gave a big boost to Mac computers and laptops. Apple continued with a new operating system every year. El Capitan in 2015, Sierra in 2016, High Sierra in 2017, Mojave in 2018, Catalina in 2018, Big Sur in 2020 and then Monterey in 2021. All the new operating systems use encryption by default meaning if someone has a password and their computer dies, there is no way to do data recovery on it if password is not known. Older models did not have this feature turned on by default rather it as an option if user wanted to use it. Over all they got better and better over time. In this article, I tried to define operating systems used in computers and laptops. I also talked about their versions and who introduced these systems."

They used it in their non-Intel computers. Then they came with up cheetah, puma and Panther and then Tiger. Around 2005, 2006 they had to move from IBM processor to Intel. This era was the beginning of a marathon for them. This was the time when they introduced Leopard and Snow Leopard. In the beginning, users were not accepting to switch to Mac because there were a lot of compatibility issues with most of the applications. All third party applications were fully compatible with windows operating system. With the passage of time, third party developers started to write apps for OS X. By the time Apple introduced Lion and mountain lion apps were slowly getting compatible with OS X. In 2013 Apple came up with Mavericks and then Yosemite in 2014. This was the time, most applications were being written for OS X. This gave a big boost to Mac computers and laptops. Apple continued with a new operating system every year. El Capitan in 2015, Sierra in 2016, High Sierra in 2017, Mojave in 2018, Catalina in 2018, Big Sur in 2020 and then Monterey in 2021. All the new operating systems use encryption by default meaning if someone has a password and their computer dies, there is no way to do data recovery on it if password is not known. Older models did not have this feature turned on by default rather it as an option if user wanted to use it. Over all they got better and better over time. In this article, I tried to define operating systems used in computers and laptops. I also talked about their versions and who introduced these systems."
