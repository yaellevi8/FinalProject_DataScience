0,Blog posts 5 Useful Tips on How to Clean Fish Poop in Tank,pets," One of the most important aspects of owning a fish tank is keeping it clean. This means removing fish poop and other waste materials regularly. If you want to keep fish as home pets and you can't clean fish poop in tanks, look for the best waste remover, water changer, and gravel cleaner near you. In this blog post, we will share with you five tips on how to clean fish poop in your tank quickly and easily. This is by far one of the best methods to get rid of fish poop in your tank. All you need to do is make the water level drop in your aquarium by temporarily removing some of its water. You can then scoop out all the waste that has gathered at the bottom into a bucket with another container underneath it to catch any excess water (if there are live plants in your tank). You can also use an air compressor or a regular hair dryer (used for this purpose only) to blow away any dead leaves and uneaten food particles near the surface before refilling it back. When done properly, performed once or twice in a month, this helps reduce organic build-up and decreases the frequency of water changes. A handy fish tank vacuum is an attachment you attach to your aquarium's filtration system. It gets especially designed to suck up all kinds of debris, including fish waste and uneaten food. You will need to place the fish poop vacuum in either of two ways: •	Attach it directly into the outlet tube that leads back into your aquarium •	You can attach it through another smaller tube that runs parallel with the main filtration/pump tubing before reaching the water return valve. This ensures that almost all waste material inside your tank gets sucked out. Cleaning tabs are small packets of detergent designed to be placed in the gravel or inside your filter cartridge, where they dissolve slowly to clean away organic waste without depleting oxygen levels in the water. Since these tabs are tiny, it is best you remove any larger fish like Koi and goldfish when you use this type of product. You can then temporarily put them back into your aquarium after removing all the poop. Make sure that the cleaning tab packets do not contain harmful chemicals, since fish could easily swallow them by accident. A siphon is an easy-to-use tool for removing waste from your fish tank, but make sure there are no living plants or fish inside before attaching it. This is because the siphon sucks up everything around it, including your fish's tank mates. It works by sucking up waste into a vacuum hose that leads outside of your aquarium where you can then discard it without polluting the environment. Even if there are plants and fish inside your tank, you can still use this tool since most of them cannot survive underwater, anyway. Just be sure to feed them before using the siphon so they won't get sucked inside as well. Using baking soda is another good way on how to clean fish poop in a tank. It acts like an organic magnet attracting all harmful bacteria floating around in your aquarium water, which causes poor water quality and causes fish to get sick. Once most of the bacteria go, your water becomes purified and clear again. Baking soda is also very cheap and easy to find in most supermarkets or local grocery stores. Just make sure you never mix baking soda with any other types of cleaner since this could release toxic fumes that are not only harmful for your fish, but for you as well!"
1,Service Dogs Against Anxiety and Depression,pets," Can a cat's purring or a dog's tail wagging help us if we suffer from anxiety or depression? In some cases, the answer is yes. ""Pets offer unconditional love that can be very beneficial to people with depression,"" said Ian Cook, psychiatrist and director of the Depression Clinic and Research Program at UCLA. If you have a cat or dog at home, you will agree that they are not only excellent roommates, but often unwitting therapists. Several studies have confirmed that pets help lower blood pressure and relieve stress. For those suffering from anxiety and depression, animals are often a great help in coping with the day and the difficulties that are encountered on a daily basis. This is true for both adults and children. How can dogs help manage depression, anxiety and stress? More than other animals, dogs are particularly attuned to humans, their behaviors and their emotions. While on the one hand they are able to ""learn"" many of the commonly used words, on the other hand they have a high sensitivity to the tone of voice used, body language and gestures. And as happens with the best of our human friends, a faithful dog can look you in the eye, catch an emotion and try to understand how you feel and what you think (doing their best while waiting for the next walk or meal, of course). While most people who own a dog are very clear about the joys of having an animal friend, on the other hand some are not well aware of the enormous physical and mental benefits that far outweigh the pleasure of company. Only recently has a number of scientific studies begun to explore the benefits of the link between humans and animals. The American Heart Association has linked the presence of an animal friend (especially the dog) to a reduction in the risk of heart disease and an increase in lifespan. The studies also revealed that: Those who have a dog are less likely to suffer from depression than those who do not. People who have dogs show lower blood pressure in stressful situations. A study also found that people with threshold hypertension experienced a drop in blood pressure levels in the five months following the adoption of a dog in a kennel. Playing with a dog or cat can increase serotonin and dopamine levels and consequently allow for greater calm and relaxation. Anyone who has a pet has, compared to others, a lower level of triglycerides and cholesterol. Patients who have suffered a heart attack tend to have a higher survival rate if they have an animal friend. Those over 65 who have a pet have about 30% fewer medical visits than those who don't. One of the reasons for the therapeutic effects is that dogs satisfy one of the basic needs of the human being: contact. Even criminals locked up in prison have shown long-term behavioral changes after interacting with the dogs. Caressing, hugging and in general touching the beloved animal friend can quickly calm and comfort us when we are anxious or under stress. The company of an animal can also relieve a sense of loneliness, and many dogs can also help us get healthy exercise, all of which are essential for alleviating depression. Psychiatric Service Dogs Dogs can improve people’s daily life with just their presence and contact, but they can actually do much more than that. Dogs can be trained as Psychiatric Service Dogs to assist people with physical or mental impairment, such as depression, PTSD, anxiety, panic attacks and other mental conditions that affect daily life. They play a key role in helping improve their lives, making it easier for them to do stuff they won’t be able or would find it very difficult to do alone. Dogs trained to be Psychiatric Service Dogs learn to carry out a great variety of tasks, such as turning on/off lights, help their handler get some space in a crowd if feeling overwhelmed, or even guide the handler away from the crowd to a more isolated spot, alerting of a upcoming panic attack, so that the handler can take medication, use body pressure to calm down the handler (deep pressure) and even help their handlers discern hallucinations from reality. Some tasks PSDs perform are requested by their owner, but some others are cued by the situation and environment, and their execution rely in part on the dogs best judgement. The incredible thing is that dogs are so smart that if thought in the right way they can learn all these tasks at home with their family, with just the guidance of an experienced instructor. Service Dog Training School International proved this already with their online service dog training courses, which have received much praise by the students enrolled in the courses and have successfully trained thousands of professional service dogs. All you need is commitment and love."
2,WHY A DOG IS A GREAT CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR CHILDREN,pets," A pet could be a great Christmas present for children or elders, especially a puppy dog, so cute and a great companion and source of entertainment. There is a number of reasons why a puppy dog can be great for children, here I have listed 5: Responsibility. By taking care of their dog, feeding, providing water, grooming, cleaning after him, children can understand the meaning of being responsible for something, and along with it, feel a sense of importance and satisfaction which comes with fulfilling one’s duties. Patience. Dogs have a personality of their own, and a will of their own, especially if they are puppies and have not been trained yet. This means that they could chew on furniture, pee indoors, literally bring havoc onto a house. It requires a great deal of patience to not get angry, to not yell to the dog, and methodically train the dog good habits, so that all the family can happily coexist together. Empathy. Just like humans, dogs can feel emotions and pain; they feel upset if we yell at them or if we are angry at them, they feel lonely if we do not interact with them for a prolonged period of time. By witnessing the dog’s emotions, children can learn to empathize with them, and to recognize and react to the same emotions in humans or other pets. Socialization. Dogs need a lot of attention and affection, by learning how to interact with their dog, children can learn the skills of socialization, applicable also to humans. Moreover, dogs are basically social magnets, when kids are out taking the dog for a stroll in the park, they are certainly going to attract a lot of attention from the other kids, and this can help shy kids with striking up a conversation and making new friends. Health. Dogs love playing and running, they need to be taken out every day, sometimes more than once a day, and this is a fantastic way for children to exercise, and get some fresh air outdoors, instead of being stuck inside glued to their tablets, mobile phones or video-games. Plus, children who grow up with a dog are less prone to develop allergies. Most importantly, dogs are a real source of fun and joy, they are faithful companions, they are not judgmental, they stick by their owners/family, they make you feel loved and protected. I would not want to grow without the joy of having a dog friend around. Dogs are although a life commitment, one cannot just acquire a dog, and then abandon him because he does not meet some idyllic and not very down-to-earth expectations. And dogs should be treated right, they should be fed well, groomed, get their vaccinations, cured when needed and cared upon. That said, it is also important that dogs are trained, so that they can fit better in the family environment, that they are not dangerous for children and strangers, and that they can be safely taken out in public to share more time with the family even outside the confines of the house. The training can be done together with the kids under the supervision of an adult, this way the gift will not only be the dog, but a lot of quality time to spend with the family, having fun training the cute newcomer. Letting the children join in the dog training, will also help them build a strong bond with the dog, help the kid understand how to communicate with the dog correctly and effectively, how to interpret the dog’s behaviors. Choosing an online training course might be the best option, as it allows the training to progress at one’s own pace, fitting better into a busy family life schedule, and giving the possibility to review more than once the training materials to better fix the teachings to memory. A good example is the SDTSI’s Service Dog Puppy Training 101 Course, which teaches puppies all the basic skills they need to become good mannered and obedient dogs. Service Dog Training School International employs only positive reinforcement training methods, which makes training lots of fun. In the end, it is not really important what present you get for your kids for Christmas, what they need is love and friendship, and in my opinion, dogs embody both."
3,Why dogs are humans’ best friends?,pets," The friendship between dogs and humans has ancient origins and was born spontaneously when wolves approached our species in search of food resources with a lower expenditure of energy. This millennial relationship continues to the present day and the relationship has become more and more solid. ""The dog is man's best friend"". We have always been used to using this definition and thinking that it is ""normal"" to live with him and that he is part of our life. But how did this friendship start? How far back must we go in time to understand what is the path that dogs and humans have made together in the course of history? In recent decades, theories on dog domestication have changed a lot and, in some cases, have completely revolutionized what has always been believed. In fact, man has always been considered the only and absolute protagonist of this process and a passive role was attributed to the dog. The most common theories were that some wolf adults had been captured and subsequently reproduced in captivity, or that they had collected pups and raised them. Among the first scholars to question them, highlighting their gaps and critical points, there were Lorna and Raymond Coppinger with their book “Dogs. A surprising new interpretation of the origin, evolution and behavior of the dog "". According to their thesis, the domestication process is not based on a direct action towards the wolf but, more generally, on the environment: the abundance of food coming from human settlements in the form of leftovers, would in practice create a new ecological niche suitable to be occupied. In other words, some wolves would have spontaneously approached us for the possibility of finding food resources with a lower expenditure of energy. These subjects would then begin to reproduce independently from each other giving rise to a new subspecies different both for physical and behavioral traits. In particular, the most relevant feature was that of having a shorter ""escape distance"". This means that the first dogs, although not yet properly domesticated, tolerated the proximity of human beings more, tended not to run away from their sight and took a short time to get closer. The first great alliance However, before talking about friendship, there is still a question we need to ask ourselves. Why have we accepted this presence? Having a diet partly similar to ours, the dog could have been considered a competitor, chased away or even preyed upon. In reality, it did not behave as such and on the contrary it probably showed characteristics of some usefulness. But, although we have always thought first of all to guard and protection activities, or to aid in hunting, in reality probably the first great task that the dogs took on and which turned out to be important was linked to their role as ""scavengers"", who cleaned up waste in our settlements. In societies such as those of 15,000 years ago (or perhaps more), where there were no sewers or other disposal facilities, the accumulation of waste and biological remains around the camps could prove dangerous both from a health point of view and in attracting others potentially dangerous animal species. Those societies that therefore accepted the presence of dogs could have a concrete advantage in health and safety. One of the first reasons for this ancient friendship, then, could be based more on the eating habits of this species than on other performative skills. Workmates, but not only Once it became a regular visitor to our villages, an accepted presence, the dog was not only able to show us all its qualities and intelligence, but it can be said that it has contributed to change us and change the course of our history. And in fact, between 15 and 40 thousand years ago, the dog was the first ever to make us understand that coexistence with different species was not only possible, but even advantageous. All the others came thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of years later. In the current technological age, where we have machines for any purpose, we tend to forget the importance of domestication. However, it would be enough to think that some species have speeded up transport, favored trade and connected distant peoples to each other; others have made it possible to cultivate large plots of land and feed entire populations; still others to be able to cover and warm up in the coldest climates. In short, much of our progress depends on domestication. In this process the dog not only acted as a forerunner, approaching us spontaneously and showing us not to be dangerous, but he accompanied us by staying by our side and in many cases providing us with precious help. He helped us in defense, in hunting, in leading the herds to pasture and in protecting them. In short, he did not behave simply as a friend, but as a member of a group, in which to take on a role, tasks and for which to sacrifice himself if needed. And today? This millennial relationship continues to the present day and, although modern life is very different from that of our ancestors, the bond with dogs does not seem to have weakened. They have come to live in cities and in our homes; they come with us to many places and even on vacation; we dedicate part of our time to them by purchasing increasingly targeted services: from the veterinarian to the educator, from sports to leisure activities. But how has our relationship with this species evolved? Even if those activities that they have carried out for millennia are no longer so widespread, dogs have been able to readjust themselves to our contemporary society in many ways and the role they have assumed demonstrates their friendship as perhaps we had never before been able to understand. New activities As we refined our knowledge, we learned how to teach them extremely complex activities. These range from social utility in assistance to civil protection in rescue and search, or in the army and law enforcement. In these activities our friends give us every day proof not only of their incredible intelligence and adaptability, but of knowing how to carry out their role as a real mission, demonstrating the self-denial and the capacity for sacrifice that only those who nurture a deep bond are able to prove. Service Dogs One of the most important jobs that dogs can take on nowadays, is that of a service dog. There are many types of service dogs, and they all share the same purpose, helping and supporting people with health and/or mental disabilities. Service dogs are trained to use their strong capabilities to perform incredible tasks, such as sensing oncoming seizures and alerting their assisted or others who could help, pushing or pulling wheelchairs, stopping self-harming behaviors, helping discern reality from hallucinations, and the list could go on a while… What’s most amazing is that many types of service dog can be trained directly at home by their owner, with the help of professional guidance. The bond between the dog and owner helps the training being more effective and successful, and at the same time training together helps tightening the bond and getting stronger synergy. There are many professionals who provide service dog training services both online and offline, among them Service Dog Training School International which provides online training courses for service dogs, psychiatric service dogs, therapy dogs, diabetic alert dogs and other dog training courses which show us just how lucky we are to have dogs in our lives as our companions, and how much good the bond between our species has brought, is keep bringing and will bring."
4,How many diverse types of service dogs and what they do?,pets," Humans have identified dogs as their loyal companions since the dawn of time, and many leading past civilizations, recognizing their enormous potential and abilities, have raised dogs to the status of deities, like Anubis for the Egyptians, Xolotl for the Mayas tribe, and Cerberus for the Greeks. Even now we are often awe-struck by the incredible new abilities we find out in our dog friends, like the ability to sense and alert of oncoming epileptic seizures, the ability to smell low and high blood sugar levels, and according to a research of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Durham University in the UK, dogs even have the capacity of smelling COVID-19 on people with a successful rate of 94%. Dogs might not be deities, but they definitely have some superpowers. And what is most heart-warming, is that dogs use their “powers” every day to help people in need, making their life safer and easier to get by. Share America estimates that in 2021 approximately 500,000 registered service dogs are helping people, and they seem to be nowhere to enough, as more families are applying to get their own service dog and are stuck in long waiting queues. Although I like to call them superheroes, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines service dogs as “dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities.” Service dogs help both people with physical and mental disabilities, and there are various types of service dogs, each trained to conduct different tasks, according to the condition of the assisted. Here I have summed up 8 different type of service dogs, and what they can do. Guide dogs are the eyes of blind and visually impaired people, they help them travel safely and confidently through familiar environments as well as foreign ones. The handler will tell the guide dog where to go, and the service dog will navigate him/her safely, avoiding obstacles, alerting the handler of doors and steps in the way, as well as low hanging tree branches or other objects in the way which could harm the handler, finding pedestrian crossings when necessary to cross the street, and leading its handler to cross only when it is safe to do so. An interesting characteristic of guide dogs is that they are trained to obey their handler but are also trained to disobey him/her! It is called “intelligent disobedience,” meaning that the guide dog can refuse to carry out a handler’s command, if it feels it is unsafe, and would cause harm to the handler. Like stepping out onto the street when there is oncoming traffic. Labradors and Golden Retrievers are usually employed as guide dogs, and they start their training very young, when they are just puppies. At first, they learn just the basic commands, such as “sit,” “drop” and “stay,” then they spend around six months learning how to behave in public and busy environments without getting distracted from their job. After that they start the real guide dog training, which usually takes 6 months to 1 year, finally they are paired with a handler with whom they will train with, until they are ready to be on their own. Hearing dogs are the ears of deaf and hearing-impaired people. They are trained to alert their handlers of common sounds, such as alarm clock, doorbell, mobile ringing, baby’s cry, smoke alarm, or other important noises meaningful to the handler. To alert, they would make physical contact, by nudging with their nose or pawing. Many hearing dogs are also trained to lead their handler to the source of the noise, or in some cases, where the source of the noise is dangerous and could harm their handler, they would lead away from it to a safer location. Although hearing dogs are trained to be attentive to certain sounds, they are also trained to tune out all unimportant background noises and stay focused on their jobs, especially when outside, where busy street noises could be scaring and overwhelming for untrained dogs. Hearing dogs can also be taught respond to Sign Language cues, when they are to assist people who are non-verbal. Most hearing dogs are small to medium size mixed breeds, although people tend to prefer Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, Poodles and Cocker Spaniels for this job, still what is really important is that the dog is very attentive to sound, has a steady temperament, is friendly and people-oriented and has the ability to stay focused on its job, to become a valid hearing service dog. Mobility service dogs are trained to assist physically disabled people with mobility issues, ranging from milder issues like poor balance, to more severe ones, like the impossibility to ambulate without a wheelchair. Apart from providing love, affection and company, mobility service dogs can do a lot to help their assisted, they help their handler maintain his/her balance while walking or going up and down the stairs, can pick up and carry objects, open and close doors, drawers and cabinets, switch lights on and off, and even pull the wheelchair, although it is suggested that the dog pulls only for a short amount of time, and not as the only traction, but along with the handler operating the wheelchair. Usually, medium to big size dogs are chosen to be trained as mobility service dogs, as their tasks require a bit of physical strength. Prioritized dog breeds for this job are Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, Bernese Mountain Dogs and Poodles. Psychiatric service dogs (PSDs), unlike the service dogs listed above, are not meant to assist people with physical issues, but to help people with mental health disorders. This does not make them any less important, and their job is actually somewhat trickier, given the difficulty of identifying the cues of the disease presenting itself, like hallucinations, anxiety, or panic. Psychiatric service dogs can offer their services to people affected by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobias. They are able to prevent or reduce anxiety and panic attacks, as well as emotional meltdowns by distracting the handler, or applying physical pressure to provide comfort and help the handler calm down. They can warn people around to give you space, and fetch medications, as well as alert others if they feel their handler is in danger. For people who suffer of hallucinations, PSDs are extremely helpful in helping them discern what is real and what is not, keeping them anchored firm to reality. Seen how psychiatric service dogs’ job is not only ruled by verbal cues coming from their handlers directly, but it is mostly triggered by the cues coming from the handler’s body language, changes in attitude and feeling, or from the environment itself, it is important that psychiatric service dogs train close to their handlers to identify, understand and memorize the cues of oncoming attacks, and be able to respond more efficiently. Dog of any breed can be trained to become PSDs, what is important is that the dog is sociable, attentive, able to focus on its job, and has a steady temper. For this reason, many people decide to train their own dog or a newly purchased dog they feel a connection with, as their PSD. There are many PSD training courses available both online and offline to choose from. Diabetic Alert Dogs make use of their enhanced sense of smell dog superpower to detect radical changes in blood sugar levels, too low or too high blood sugar levels, and alert their diabetic assisted to check their sugar levels and if necessary, take medication. They can also alert others if the situation gets too critical. It is still not clear whether the diabetic alert service dog can scent a difference in the smell of the breath or sweat or body odour, it is anyway a great superpower to have. Allergy detection dogs, like diabetic alert dogs, use their super sense of smell, 2,000 times more powerful than human sense of smell, to smell and detect any trace of allergens which could harm their handler. The most common allergens are nuts, peanuts, wheat, milk, eggs, shellfish, latex, and certain chemicals used in cleaning detergents. The allergy detection dog is sometimes required to do a room sweep to detect any trace of the allergen, or to smell hot or cold food. Some allergies are so severe, that just a small assumption of the allergen would cause anaphylaxis, and in the worst-case scenario death, if not cured promptly. Allergy detection service dogs with their presence offer additional security to people affected by severe allergies, helping them live their lives with more ease and a higher feeling of safety. Autism Service Dogs often offer their services to autistic children, but adults affected by autism can be assisted by an autism service dog as well. When assisting children, autism service dogs are beneficial in helping with them with social interaction, to build up confidence. They also help preventing the kid from wandering, can prevent or placate emotional meltdowns, and can stop repetitive and harmful behavior. Through their daily interaction, they encourage verbal communication, sensory stimulation, and focus. Dog breeds more adapt to be trained as autism service dogs are Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Labradoodles, Great Pyrenees, Old English Sheepdogs. Seizure Alert service Dogs assist people affected by epilepsy in a number of ways. They alert others when a seizure occurs, to protect their assisted, they soften their fall by placing their body between the seizing subject and the floor, and when the subject is lying on the floor, the Seizure Dog will lie next to assisted to prevent injuries. Although there is no scientific proof or understanding, Seizure Alert Dogs seem able to recognize when a seizure is imminent, and alert before it starts its devastating effects. This makes them even more precious and useful. Might just be another of dogs’ mysterious superpowers we know so little about."
5,"Service Dog, Companion Dog, Therapy Dog, which dog can best support a Child with Autism?",pets," It depends. There is no right answer to this question, it depends on the child and its family situation and expectations. Families who need their child to be accompanied by its dog friend at school and at medical facilities, might opt for a service dog or a therapy dog, while families who are looking for a dog to assist their child at home, providing emotional comfort and stimulation might consider a companion dog instead. Let us have a look at the characteristics of each dog category, to get a clearer understanding of the benefits they can provide and the cost they require. SERVICE DOG Service dogs are dogs extensively trained in a variety of tasks to support people with disabilities. They are trained according to the specific needs of the person they assist and receive a service dog certification, which grants them entrance in all public places. (At least in the US according to the ADA, you might want to check your local regulations on this topic.) Specifically, to autism, service dogs can be trained to prevent and stop emotional meltdowns, to stop repetitive and self-harming behaviors, to warn if the child is wandering off and help in the search if the child gets lost. Get: A number of organizations provide fully trained service dogs to diagnosed autistic children, however the cost is exceedingly high, around $40,000-$60,000, and in some cases dogs have been reported not being able to perform all the tasks for which they were paid. Some charities and no-profit organizations also can provide service dogs free of charge, although their waiting lists are long, it can easily take 2-3 years of waiting, and application criteria are quite narrow. Train: There are both offline and online service dog training schools offering training courses to train home dogs or newly purchased dogs to become efficient service dogs. Total training usually requires around one year, and prices can vary greatly, from a few $ dollars to thousands of dollars. Service Dog Training School International, for example, offers their service dog online training course at $399. Training your own service dog can be a better solution then purchasing one, because of a number of reasons. For starters, during training the parent handler and the kid will be able to establish a deeper bond with the dog, resulting in better performance on the dog’s end and better understanding of the dog abilities and reactions on the handler’s end. When training, the kid will benefit of sensory and verbal stimulation, and will exercise his/her ability to focus on an activity for a longer period. Breeds: Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Labradoodle, Great Pyrenees, Old English Sheepdogs. THERAPY DOG Therapy dogs are good tempered dogs trained to provide affection and support in therapeutic settings. They are trained to feel mood shifts and to act to comfort their assisted. Unlike service dogs, therapy dogs are not trained to perform incredible tasks, and do not have legal right to public access, but offer autistic children invaluable emotional support, help with social engagement, promote cognitive and emotional growth, and provide unlimited and unjudgmental companionship. Get: Therapy dogs can be purchased from reliable breeders and trainers, and their price can vary a lot, average price is around $10,000, including dog purchase and training expenses. Train: Majority of people would choose to train their own therapy dog with offline or online training courses, as it requires less effort and less time than training a service dog. Training costs are between $500-$5,000. Breed: Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Poodle, Pomeranian, Pug. What is most important is the temperament of the individual dog, and not the breed itself. COMPANION DOG Companion dogs do not perform specific tasks, they just provide comfort as pets. Like any other pet dog, they are still required to be good-mannered, especially when in public, achievable with basic training. Although they are not trained to do anything specific to support autistic children, their only presence provides constant comfort and happiness, and give children in the autistic spectrum the opportunity to experience friendship, while it is usually quite difficult for them to bond with their peers. According to multiple studies, the presence of companion dogs helps autistic children sleep better, interaction with them helps stimulate verbal skills, and taking care of their dog friend brushing and feeding makes them more aware of responsibilities and life routines. Get: Companion dogs can be purchased by any reliable breeder or trainer. Pricing varies according to the breed. Train: No specific training is required, although it is recommended that the companion dog, like any other dog, gets good manners and obedience training, to behave well at home and in public. This type of basic good dog citizen training courses can be found online or offline at local dog trainers, and their price can space between a few hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars. Breed: Golden Retriever, Saint Bernard, Labradoodle, German Shepherd, Bernese Mountain Dog, Samoyed, Beagle. In conclusion, we can affirm that service dogs are the best trained and are the best solution for families that can afford it economically and with timings. Therapy dogs and companion dogs are definitely a faster and cheaper option, although the assistance services they can provide are more limited if compared to service dogs. One should consider what type of assistance the kid really needs to make the right decision. Contacting the doctor or service dog organizations for advice, can help providing a professional insight."
6,Why Dog Owners Should Invest In A Treat Pouch,pets," Many first-time dog owners do not realize the importance of having a treat pouch. Regardless of whether you are training your dog or not (which you likely will), you should invest in a good treat pouch. Having a treat pouch will allow you to bring all dog-related necessities with you when you head outdoors. Most treat pouches have also been designed to make space for your everyday items! Here, I will share the 3 benefits of having a treat pouch: When you are training your dog indoors, you can use a bowl to hold the treats. However, if you bring your dog outside, it is terribly inconvenient to bring along a bowl or a packet of treats that you have to constantly hold onto. A treat pouch will come in handy in this scenario. You can put the treats in the treat pouch, and when you give a command, you can quickly reach for the treats to reward your dog. Some owners may argue that their trainings are done indoors, so purchasing a treat pouch is a waste of money. That could not be further away from the truth! You can plan to have most of the training is likely to be done indoors, but you are also likely to also have a few impromptu training sessions outdoors. For example, if you want your dog to sit down next to you beside the bench, you are going to give it the command ‘sit’. After it sits down, if you have a treat pouch (containing treats) with you, you can reward it for obeying the command, making it more likely for your dog to obey you the next time you give the command. However, if you do not have treats with you, you are unable to provide the reward for your dog. With a lack of positive reinforcement (treats), your dog will be less likely to obey you, especially in public spaces. The reason being, if you only reward your dog when it is indoors, it may contextualize the commands as only applicable in the indoor setting. Your dog will also have no motivation to obey your commands if it knows that it will definitely will not get a reward for obeying. A treat pouch used to be what was named: a bag to hold treats. However, most treat pouches have evolved from only containing treats to including a whole array of stuff. Most treat pouches are big enough for you to put dog toys (like balls and tug-of-war ropes) in it. They also include rings that you can hook things like a collapsible bowl to use when you are outside. Majority come with poop bag dispensers so that you do not have to hold a roll on your hand. A handful of them include poop bag holders just in case there are no bins nearby. Some treat pouches include additional pockets to put your daily necessities, such as your wallet, mobile phone, keys, and cash. A few even have a slot for your water bottle to ensure that you stay hydrated as you walk your dog! In summary, treat pouches now can hold much more than just treats. They can hold your everyday items, dog toys, and even water bottles, allowing you much more convenience than before! Which brings me to my next point…… In the past, when treat bags are only used to hold treats, you will have to make space if you want to bring other items. For example, if you want to bring a water bottle, you will have to either hold it on your hand (terribly inconvenient) or put it in a sling bag. Poop bag dispensers are stand-alone objects that has to be carried on the hand or attached to the leash. If you bring along wallets, keys, and other necessities, you will either have to bring a small bag or stuff everything in your pockets and hope they do not fall out. Treat pouches now can make your life much easier by holding everything you may need for an outdoor trip in them. This will make outings with your dogs much more convenient than packing things in different bags and having a hard time digging them out when you need them."
7,4 Ways To Prepare Fruit Treats For Your Dog,pets," Fruits contain many nutrients that are useful to dogs. For example, most berries are high in antioxidants which can help dogs build a robust immune system, and melons help maintain vision health. While plain fruits are enough for your furry friend, why not make the fruits a little tastier and more interesting for both of you? Here, I will introduce 4 different ways that you can prepare fruit treats for your dog. Ice Cubes with Fruits This method is suitable for dogs who do not like to drink water, ensuring that your dog drinks some water for every treat it eats. Things you will need: Knife Ice cube trays or molds Water Fruits How to prepare: Use the knife to cut the selected fruit into small, bite-sized chunks. Put 1-3 pieces of fruit into each ice cube/mold partition (depending on the size of the partition). Add water until about 3/4 of each partition is filled. Freeze for at least 3 hours. Remove from tray/mold and serve to your dog. Recommended serving size in one day: 3-4 ice cubes Frozen Blended Fruits This method is suitable for dogs who had some or most of their teeth removed as they can eat the treat by continuous licking. Things you will need: High water content fruits: Bananas, peaches, watermelons, etc. Water Blender Ice cube trays or molds How to prepare: Put the fruits (one type or a combination) into the blender. For every cup of fruits, put about 1/3 to 1/4 cup of water. Blend until you get a puree. Pour the blend into the ice cube tray/molds. Freeze for approximately 3 hours. Remove from tray/mold and serve to your dog. Recommended serving size in one day: 2-3 ice cubes Roasted Fruits This method is suitable for picky dogs who like to have strong-tasting foods as roasting makes the fruits taste sweeter. Things you will need: Bigger fruits: Apples, pears, strawberries, etc. Oven Parchment paper How to prepare: Cut the fruits into half/quarters/one-eighth (depending on the size of the fruit used). Place the cut side on the parchment Roast the fruits in a preheated oven at approximately 400°F for about 10-25 minutes (depending on the size of the fruits). Place to cool before feeding your dog. Recommended serving size in one day: 1-2 pieces of fruit Gummy Fruits All dogs can consume gummy fruits. Things you will need: Xylitol-free gelatin* Fruits Juicer (to make fruit juice) Saucepan Molds Knife (optional) *Important: Dogs cannot consume artificial xylitol, so check the ingredients in the gelatin packet before use. How to prepare: Get fruit juice from the fruits using the juicer. Pour the fruit juice and the xylitol-free gelatin into a saucepan and heat it on low-medium heat until the gelatin is fully dissolved. For how much gelatin to use, refer to the package. Remove from heat and pour into molds. Leave to cool in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. When the gummies have solidified, remove them by using the knife to separate the gummy from the mold gently. Alternatively, pushing the bottom of the mold or knocking the mold at about 45° against a surface. Recommended serving size in one day: 1-2 jellies Precautions to Take Note Dogs can be allergic to certain fruits, so monitor your dog after you feed it fruits. If it shows any signs of discomfort or illness, bring it to the local veterinarian immediately. When selecting fruits to make the treats, remember to screen for unripe, over-ripe, and moldy fruits. The nutritional content of these fruits is different from ripe fruits and can make your dog sick. If there are removable seeds and skins, a rule of thumb is to remove them. For example, apple and watermelon seeds can cause digestive issues in dogs."

The Benefits Of Dog Grooming dog grooming perth is essential for both your dog’s good looks and his health. However, doing these tasks at home may be complicated, so you might want to consider the benefits of professional dog washing perth With proper dog grooming northern suburbs, you can eliminate mats, ticks, fleas, shedding, and stop other severe health conditions developing that you may have had no idea about. So, fret no more because we are giving you an in-depth look at how important and beneficial regular grooming is. Detection and Prevention Going to a professional dog groomer northern suburbs will benefit your dog very much so. It’s the best way to detect any problems that your dog might have, and early detection is very important as if you catch it early treatment is likely to be shorter and easier — of course depending on what it is. Our dog grooming quinns rocks will look for rashes, lesions, inflammation, lumps, or infections that any normal dog owner could miss. You’ll be able to prevent any major health conditions or catch an underlying problem, which you might have had no idea about. Image for post Maintaining a Healthy Coat and Fur Maintaining a healthy coat and fur for your dog means that you have to groom them frequently. They can’t just jump into the shower and clean themselves as we can. Plus, it’s not even ideal to give them a regular bath. Regular bathing will cause their natural oil to fall out, and it will also damage their coat. What you can do is brush them. Any responsible and seasoned dog owner will know that brushing your dog benefits them greatly. It will help to avoid mats in their fur. They can make the hair knot up, or pull on their tight skin, which will cause them discomfort and pain. Mats can also cause ulcers and abrasions. Brushing will bring out the natural oils in the fur and remove any dead hair, dirt, and dandruff. Your dog will have a healthier shine to their coat and will also feel healthy themselves. Whilst brushing your dog is great it is also useful to comb them through with a fine comb as this can reveal fleas that you may not be aware of. Taking Care of their Nails When it comes to grooming, you must not forget about their nails. Uncut nails can lead to joint pain, as it means the dog may not be walking with pads in alignment. This is quite a common problem in dogs. Trimmed nails will keep them from curling, and will stop germs from getting stuck in there. If you do decide to do this, invest in some proper nail clippers that are made especially for dogs. This will make cutting their nails much easier and will also make it less painful for your dog. If you are nervous about this ask your vet for advice. Benefits of Regular Grooming and Brushing Having a well-groomed, clean, and nice smelling dog around the house means that your house will be less likely to have bad odours gathering in your home. Regular grooming also causes less shedding from your dog. You don’t have to vacuum clean your house every day if you keep up with the grooming. You’re also eliminating and preventing fleas and ticks from settling in as well. The best part is, a good brushing session will make you bond with your dog, and who doesn’t love creating good memories with their dogs? Positive Behaviour The most important part about regular dog grooming is that it affects your dog’s mental health as well. A good looking, good smelling dog with a nice haircut will make your dog feel This can affect their mental state and thus their behaviour as well. Come to Bubbly Paws #1 Dog Groomer In Quinns Rocks"
10,How to help a stray dog,pets," Being an animal lover all my life and taking care of pets it just breaks my heart when I see a stray dog wandering the streets, especially in the cold months. I always wonder if they are lost, mistreated, or worst abandoned!  I had captured a few stray dogs myself and luckily found the owners but sometimes we take that risk although we know nothing about the animal.  We have our good intentions but if you don’t know what to do or who to call it can be frustrating, especially if you have a sick or injured animal. One of the reasons why stray dogs end up lost is because they aren’t wearing a collar or any tags. Unfortunately, other reasons are abusive or abandonment situations but we won't touch upon that in this post. Most owners who take care of their dogs will always have a collar but sometimes owners don’t provide the right collar for their pets and get loose. In this article, I will give some tips on what to do when you see a stray cat or dog. Safety first when catching a stray dog When you are outside and see a skinny, malnourished dog it can be devastating. If you have a big heart and want to get the stray dog off the streets you must proceed with caution. These animals are unpredictable because they are scared or starving, and maybe aggressive. If you are close to home, get a leash, blanket, and some food. Use a calm voice to coax him to you're car, make no sudden moves, and make sure that they can see you at all times. Call Animal Control for strays It’s always a good idea to call in the experts. If you are not able to hold down the dog or he runs from you, call the Local Animal Control Agency. Leave your name and phone # and inquire how long it would take for them to arrive. Give the exact location of the area that you last saw the stray dog. It is advisable to do this whether the animal is injured or not. Bringing Home a Stray Dog If you bring the dog home, try to keep it from the other pets.  Check to see if the dog is infested with fleas; if he is, you’ll want to use some sort of flea control. If you can keep them in the garage, backyard (weather permitting), and with a smaller dog in a shed with blankets, then this might be a better option than your house. Wash your hands after handling the stray, and clean up his waste immediately. If he is not being aggressive keep him in a separate room in your house. This is temporary until you are ready to take him to the shelter to get him checked out. Take the dog to the local shelter Most of the shelters in Myrtle Beach are overcrowded and can’t provide the space and medical needs of our furry friends. Especially after the holidays where the perfect fur-ever Christmas present isn’t so “fur-ever” – sad but true. You can keep an eye on the dog by going online at the Horry County Gov website. They take photos of the stray dogs that come to the shelter so anyone who lost a dog will be able to check and see if their pet is there. That is the first place a pet owner will come to look. Micro -Chipped Stray Dog You could also ask the shelter to scan the animal in case it was micro-chipped. More pet owners use this method and lots of pets have been found this way. The chips are harmless and last for years. My neighbor had one years ago, and I thought it was a pretty nifty gadget. If you have lost a dog and don't want to get Miro-chipped, which may be beyond your budget. They have GPS Tracking for dogs. Promote stray dog online Thankfully social media comes through when dealing with lost and found pets. I belong to several groups myself and it does a world of good when saving dogs' lives. I see a lot of posts on Facebook Groups photos of abandoned dogs and the location. People just love to share information about lost dogs and it's two thumbs -up when the announcement comes in when they are found! Thanks for being a fur-friend! Kathy T."
