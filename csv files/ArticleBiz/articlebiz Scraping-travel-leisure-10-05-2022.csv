0,How to Handle (& Prevent!) Dental Emergencies on Your Vacation,travel-leisure," The temperature is getting warmer and the days are getting longer… summertime must be just around the corner! As a long-time Juno Beach dentist, I know that means peak vacation time is just around the corner too. If you’re using your much-deserved PTO to unwind on the beach, then the LAST thing you want to deal with is a toothache. After all, even a minor one can make trying new foods and sleeping peacefully nearly impossible. Keep reading as I share a few must-know tips for preventing dental emergencies as well as a step-by-step guide on what to do if you do experience one on vacation. First, Let’s Talk About How to Prevent Dental Emergencies If a dental emergency arises while on vacation, you can, of course, find a local dentist like me to help. However, it’s best to avoid these situations altogether to keep your vacation as stress-free as possible. Here are four key ways to help prevent a dental injury during your time off: •	Visit your dentist for a checkup and cleaning beforehand •	Maintain a solid oral hygiene regimen before, during, and after your vacation •	Avoid unhealthy dental habits, like smoking and chewing on ice •	Keep your consumption of sugary foods and beverages to a minimum Oral Hygiene Essentials to Pack in Your Bag Whether you’re going away for a few days or an entire week, it’s important to pack your bag with more than just shoes, clothes, and underwear – you need all of your oral hygiene essentials too! A few staples to pack are a soft-bristled toothbrush, floss, and a travel-sized mouthwash. It’s also a good idea to include some dental emergency-related items, like ibuprofen. Lastly, make sure to include the information of a local dentist. It may seem excessive, but you’ll be glad you did if you end up needing their phone number and address in a hurry! A Step-by-Step Guide to Handling a Dental Emergency While on Vacation Ideally, your vacation will be nothing short of relaxing and rejuvenating. However, if you do happen to experience a dental emergency, then: •	Assess the damage – Dental emergencies include everything from a sudden toothache to a completely knocked-out tooth. So, priority number one is to assess the damage. If you are struggling with a potentially life-threatening symptom, like difficulty breathing or a fractured jaw, then heading to the nearest ER is the best course of action. For all other dental-related injuries, visit a dentist. •	Take action – Once you’ve assessed the damage and determined where to seek help, there are a few things you can do. Gently rinsing your mouth out with water, using a cold compress to minimize any swelling, and taking an over-the-counter pain reliever are a few common actions patients take until their appointment. •	Visit a skilled nearby dentist – Whether you have to go to the ER first or you’re able to head straight to a dental office, it’s important to remember that only dentists can treat tooth-related injuries. The sooner you visit them, the sooner your pain-free smile will be restored. Getting a dental injury likely isn’t on your itinerary. That doesn’t mean that it won’t happen though, which is why it’s so important to be prepared. That way, even a slight hiccup like a dental emergency won’t ruin your much-deserved vacation."
1,Blake McCoy on Trips to Add to Your 2022 Bucket List,travel-leisure," The pandemic dealt a big blow to travel bucket lists everywhere. With many COVID-19 travel restrictions being lifted, this could be the year to revisit those travel plans. Here is a starting point for travel inspiration so you can begin booking travel accommodations. Stroll Through Amsterdam Home to romantic canals and distinctive architecture, Amsterdam is loaded with character and hospitable people. Do as the locals do and rent a bike to roll through the streets. This picturesque city gets a lot of attention for legalized marijuana and a red light district but offers much, much more. Whether exploring on the water, by bike, or on foot, Amsterdam has proven itself on more than one occasion to be a bucket-list-worthy destination and often serves as a gateway for American tourists to the rest of Europe. Spot Wildlife at Serengeti National Park For an immersive safari experience only found in Africa, Serengeti National Park is teeming with wildlife such as elephants, zebras, lions, and more. This national park is regarded as one of the best safari destinations in the world. The scenery and big game are some of the most awe-inspiring views humans will gaze upon in their lifetime. On my trip with family in 2007, we even took a hot air balloon ride at sunrise over the savannah. Absolutely breathtaking. Eat Tapas Throughout Spain Spain is a global tourism hotspot with unique cultural cities, stunning architecture, splendid flamenco dancers, and unmatchable food. It can be difficult to choose one city to visit, as Spain’s culture is mixed well between the big-name cities and smaller countryside towns. Instead of visiting one spot, embark on a road trip throughout the country’s various regions. Indulge in churros con chocolate for breakfast, pace yourself with tapas throughout the day and drink sangria late into the night after an afternoon siesta. Sail Through Greece Greece’s tourism was among some of the hardest hit during the pandemic. With a hopeful future ahead, the country is now welcoming back tourists. To escape the touristy islands of Santorini and Mykonos, opt for a sailing trip with stops on some of the lesser-known but beautifully inhabited islands. With over 2,000 islands, Greece has a ton of options. Set sail on calm seas and soak up the sunshine by exploring empty beaches. With that said, if you’re looking to party then go to Mykonos but prepare to pay. It’s a global hotspot for the jet-set crowd and prices reflect it."

3,Introduction to Sea Turtle Hatchings,travel-leisure," With nature being a great source of wonder to its surrounding inhabitants, one natural phenomenon that captures the hearts of children and adults alike is that of sea turtle hatchings. Sea turtles are one of the most beloved creatures on this planet, but this obsession with them has also led to shrinking numbers of their population. This is why yearly sea turtle hatchings are so important - because they allow these creatures to repopulate and begin their lives in the ocean. How Do These Sea Turtle Hatchings Work? Each summer, pregnant female sea turtles return to the beaches they once hatched from in order to find a nesting spot. After locating a perfect location, much like a human would look for their ideal doctor or hospital, the sea turtle digs her nest and lays her eggs, which generally takes up to a few hours. However, the mother doesn’t stick around for much longer. Instead, she returns to the ocean, leaving it up to fate whatever happens to her eggs. For this reason, many environmental activists and volunteers have taken measures to preserve and protect these eggs from predators and human touch so that each sea turtle has a chance to make it into the ocean once hatched. The sea turtle can lay up to 100 eggs, which remain in the sand for about 60 days. What many may not know is that the temperature of the sand often decides the gender of the hatchlings. Cooler sand will generally produce more males, while warmer sand produces more females. When the time has come to hatch, the sea turtles generally hatch at the same exact time, as if they had some secret code passed along from egg to egg that told them when to emerge. It is then time to make their way towards the ocean. During this time, they make themselves vulnerable to spying predators and curious beachgoers, which is again why many conservationists keep a close eye on these turtles from the time they were put in the nest until the moment they go out to sea. For this reason, many sea turtles will often wait until nighttime to hatch. Those that make it out often flock to the open ocean or collections of brown seaweed, sometimes swimming for up to 48 hours until they reach this destination, where some spend their first years hiding, growing and maturing. Witnessing a sea turtle hatching is one of the most memorable experiences an individual can have, but they must also be sure to keep their distance so as not to disrupt this natural process."
