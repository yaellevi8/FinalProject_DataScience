23,Some bats pretend to be bees to scare off predators: Research,science,"While studying how mouse-eared bats deal with other animals, researchers observed they buzzed like hornets or bees, possibly, in an attempt to push back potential predators. When buzzing sounds were played on speakers, bat predators were seen moving away in contrast to speakers that played non-buzzing sounds. This is the first time a mammal was found mimicking an insect."
24,Operating rooms major contributor to carbon emissions in health sector: Study,science,"As per study, operating rooms make the biggest contribution to carbon emissions within the health sector. Operating rooms generate 70% of the hospital's waste responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. They generate three to six times as much carbon as the rest of health systems, for example, a robotic-assisted hysterectomy produces carbon equivalent to driving over 3,000 kilometres in a car."
