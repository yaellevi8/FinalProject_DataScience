0,Republicans Criticize Biden For Not Starving Undocumented Immigrant Babies,social-justice," Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Republicans criticized the Biden administration on Thursday for providing food to infants detained in its custody — effectively suggesting the babies should be starved because of their immigration status. “The Biden administration has been sending pallets of baby formula for illegal mothers and their babies while American mothers and babies cannot find baby formula,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said at a news conference. “This is completely unacceptable, and this needs to end now.” “Baby formula should go to Americans before illegals,” Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) wrote on Twitter. “This should not have to be said.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) accused the administration of giving “critical supplies to illegal immigrants before the very people he took an oath to serve.” Greene referenced photos of baby formula at a border facility, likely referring to a Washington Examiner article about immigrants detained at the border receiving baby formula amid a nationwide shortage. Nehls also tweeted a link to the article. The Examiner refers to the immigrants as a “lucky group” and cites posts by Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) about “thousands and thousands of containers of baby formula” being sent to the border. Cammack said she received a photo of the deliveries from a border agent. Cammack called on people to demand the Biden administration “take the baby formula that they have basically siphoned out of the supply chain and put it back in the damn stores for American kids.” The formula shortage is a crisis. Infants need either breast milk or formula for nutrition until they are at least 1 year old, and breast milk isn’t always an option. Doctors recommend against diluting milk or formula, switching to cow’s milk or making homemade formula. So the need for Americans to access baby formula is very, very real. But babies in U.S. government custody need sustenance, too, and their parents don’t have the option of leaving detention to buy supplies. If the government didn’t provide food to the babies in its custody, they would starve. The baby formula shortage has become a popular way for Republicans to attack President Joe Biden, although few lawmakers from either party have offered actual solutions to the issue. Immigration is a popular attack line, too, so it’s not much of a surprise that the right would blame immigrant babies for stealing food from American ones. The right has demonized undocumented immigrants for years, and the U.S. has a disturbing record of neglecting or mistreating children in its care. In one of the most infamous examples, former President Donald Trump intentionally split children from their parents in an attempt to dissuade immigrants from coming to the United States. For years, Republican lawmakers have blocked efforts to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as kids. Republican politicians have suggested immigrant detention centers, including ones that lock up children, are too nice. The right’s claims about baby formula for undocumented kids fit into the narrative that Democrats are encouraging unauthorized immigration by not being harsher to undocumented people. Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser to Trump who championed many of that administration’s harshest immigration policies, said the Biden administration was “diverting scarce formula to subsidize mass illegal immigration.” How many American Parents couldn’t feed their children, or were forced to use a formula their infants couldn’t tolerate, because Biden was diverting scarce formula to subsidize mass illegal immigration through our open border? https://t.co/hdKFsMvzvo Cammack insisted that her screed against baby formula for undocumented infants was actually part of a pro-children agenda, and she accused the Biden administration of helping cartels smuggle immigrant kids by being insufficiently tough on the border. “It’s not these kids’ fault,” she said. “My heart breaks for these kids.” Just not enough to let them eat.

1,"As An Asian-American Woman, I Can't Step Outside Without Feeling Terrified",social-justice," Guest Writer Despite living in a city infamous for its lack of public transportation, I had excitedly accepted the challenge of getting around Los Angeles via bus, metro, or on foot. That all changed when the pandemic started. Initially, my anxiety was due to COVID-19, but then it was the trauma of watching Asian Americans like me get beat up or killed while walking on the street or on public transit in my city and cities like mine. In March 2021, seven people, mostly Asian women, were killed in the Atlanta-area mass shootings. Then, a few months ago, I saw myself in the grisly murders of Christina Lee and Michelle Go in New York City. Now, with anti-Asian hate crimes increasing by 339% last year, I’m terrified of being outside and away from the safety of my home or car. As soon as I step outside, I’m hyperalert and hypervigilant about everything and everyone around me. When anti-Asian hate crimes began to rise as the pandemic progressed, I was grateful for the mask mandate, as I thought it was helping me blend in by covering my face. I continued my routine of taking long walks in Los Angeles, thinking that this mask would provide me with anonymity and safety. However, very early on, when I was wearing a hat, sunglasses and a mask ― my entire face covered ― I heard two men snicker behind me and say, “Look at that Asian girl.” At that moment I realized that I will always stick out, regardless of how much I try to hide myself. Today I avoid being in heavily populated Asian spaces. The 2.7-square-mile Koreatown used to be my ultimate safe haven and a place where I could exist as a Korean and an American. It’s usually where I can find all the comforts and familiarities of home from across the Pacific Ocean. But these days I try to minimize my time there because I can’t help but feel like we are a massive collective target. Because of this fear, I never leave home without pepper spray, with the safety unlocked and in an accessible place in my pocket. When another body approaches, I instinctively put my hand around it in case I need to protect myself. It’s exhausting and requires more mental exertion and bodily awareness. I can’t stop looking at everyone like they’re a potential threat. I’ve created a safety plan in my head ― always keep an eye on the exit, don’t look people in the eye, have my pepper spray ready, and get ready to run. I avoid the neighbors, strangers and passersby I used to smile at and instead try to disappear even more than I already did as an Asian American ― the invisible minority. And when our cries are met with silence from our allies, the message is loud and clear, once again: We don’t matter. After Atlanta, a common recurring theme that I heard echoed among my Asian American therapy clients was that they didn’t feel acknowledged or seen by the non-Asian colleagues, peers and friends in their lives. We didn’t get the “are you OK” messages or the check-ins from non-Asian friends and co-workers. We continued to feel unseen and unheard. And so, in order to cope, we turned to each other. Asian American mental health care providers in California saw an increase in demand for services in the wake of surging anti-Asian hate incidents, including the killings in Atlanta. Crisis Text Line reported at the start of the pandemic that the number of Asian Americans seeking support more than doubled. I facilitated virtual support groups for Asian Americans after the events in Atlanta, and the familiar feelings of fear, loneliness, isolation and anger united us from all over the country. I met Asian Americans from all sorts of cultures and backgrounds: Korean, Chinese, Indian, Filipino, trans-racial adoptees, third-culture kids, and those without access to an Asian community. Due to many years of my internalized racism and succumbing to the model minority myth, I am the “token Asian” of my friend group, which has resulted in a lack of real connection to an Asian community. Therefore, I cherished my time in these support groups. I also needed support and understanding. We cried together and processed our fears together. We talked about our vision and goals for how we want to move forward as Asian Americans, individually and collectively. We validated and offered support to each other, which made us feel safe and connected, regulating our nervous systems and allowing us access to deeper parts of the brain used for thinking and processing. We decided that we need to be louder and prouder. We need to mobilize and use our voices even when we feel stuck and frozen. We need to educate, speak up and spread awareness. We need to see ourselves and each other if we want others to see us. So lately I’ve been trying something new. I’ve been actively seeking and cultivating relationships with other Asian Americans as a way to feel like a part of a community ― which is a basic need, as humans are biologically wired to want to connect and belong. With them, I don’t have to explain the filial piety and sense of guilt and duty I have toward my parents. I can sing songs in Korean at karaoke. We can order all the spicy food and name all the dishes correctly. With them, I feel safe and accepted, even as the world keeps spinning and the anti-Asian violence continues.

2,Tucker Carlson Goes Full-Bigot To Assess Karine Jean-Pierre's Qualifications,social-justice," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Tucker Carlson proudly wore his prejudice Tuesday in a cheap shot at new White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. (Watch the video below.) Jean-Pierre is the first Black woman and openly gay person to hold the position being vacated by Jen Psaki this week. Jean-Pierre previously worked as President Joe Biden’s deputy press secretary. The popular Fox News host declared that the administration had found someone as “shallow, nasty and partisan” as Psaki. He then assessed Jean-Pierre’s job qualifications as only someone who hates others on first sight could. “Karine Jean-Pierre is our first out LGBTQ+ White House press secretary and that’s all you need to know,” Carlson said. “It’s a good thing, shut up and celebrate. That’s why she got the job. She’s in the right group and to the Biden administration, which thinks exclusively in terms of groups and never in terms of individuals because individuals are messy and inconvenient. The group is all that matters.” “Show us your picture and we’ll tell you if you’re qualified for the job,” he added. Carlson has a deep history of homophobic and racist comments.

3,Less Immigrant Labor Across US Contributing To Price Hikes,social-justice," Just 10 miles from the Rio Grande, Mike Helle’s farm is so short of immigrant workers that he’s replaced 450 acres of labor-intensive leafy greens with crops that can be harvested by machinery. In Houston, Al Flores increased the price of his BBQ restaurant’s brisket plate because the cost of the cut doubled due to meatpacking plants’ inability to fully staff immigrant-heavy production lines. In the Dallas area, Joshua Correa raised prices on the homes his company builds by $150,000 to cover increased costs stemming partly from a lack of immigrant labor. After immigration to the United States tapered off during the Trump administration — then ground to a near complete halt for 18 months during the coronavirus pandemic — the country is waking up to a labor shortage partly fueled by that slowdown. The U.S. has, by some estimates, 2 million fewer immigrants than it would have if the pace had stayed the same, helping power a desperate scramble for workers in many sectors, from meatpacking to homebuilding, that is also contributing to supply shortages and price increases. “These 2 million missing immigrants are part of the reason we have a labor shortage,” said Giovanni Peri, an economist at the University of California at Davis, who calculated the shortfall. “In the short run, we are going to adjust to these shortages in the labor market through an increase in wages and in prices.” The labor issues are among several contributors to the highest inflation in 40 years in the United States — from supply chains mangled by the pandemic to a surge in energy and commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Steve Camarota, a researcher at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for less immigration, believes a spike in illegal immigration under President Joe Biden will make up whatever shortfall lingers from the pandemic. He also contends wage increases in low-paying sectors like agriculture are minor contributors to inflation. “I don’t think wages going up is bad for the poor, and I think mathematically it is not possible to drive down inflation by limiting wages at the bottom,” Camarota told The Associated Press. Immigration is rapidly returning to its pre-pandemic levels, researchers say, but the U.S. would need a significant acceleration to make up its deficit. Given a sharp decline in births in the United States over the past two decades, some economists forecast the overall pool of potential workers will start shrinking by 2025. The immigrant worker shortage comes as the U.S. political system is showing less of an appetite for increasing immigration. Democrats — who control all branches of the federal government and more recently have been the party more friendly to immigration — haven’t tried to advance major legislation permitting more new residents to the country. A recent Gallup poll showed worries about illegal immigration at a two-decade high. With a tough election for their party looming in November, Democrats are increasingly divided about the Biden administration’s attempt to end pandemic-related restrictions on seeking asylum. “At some point we either decide to become older and smaller or we change our immigration policy,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and former official in President George W. Bush’s administration who is president of the center-right American Action Forum. He acknowledged a change in immigration policy is unlikely: “The bases of both parties are so locked in.” That’s certainly the case in Republican-dominated Texas, which includes the longest and busiest stretch of the southern border. The Legislature in 2017 forced cities to comply with federal immigration agents seeking people who are in the U.S. illegally. Gov. Greg Abbott sent the Texas National Guard to patrol the border and recently created traffic snarls by ordering more inspections at border ports. The turn against immigration distresses some Texas business owners. “Immigration is very important for our workforce in the United States,” said Correa. “We just need it.” He’s seeing delays of two to three months on his projects as he and his subcontractors — from drywallers to plumbers to electricians — struggle to field crews. Correa has raised the standard price of his houses from $500,000 to about $650,000. “We’re feeling it and, if we’re feeling it at the end of the day as builders and developers, the consumer pays the price,” said Correa, who spoke from Pensacola, Florida, where he brought a construction crew as a favor to a client whose hasn’t been able to find laborers to fix a beach house damaged by Hurricane Sally in 2020. The share of the U.S. population born in another country — 13.5% in the latest census — is the highest it has been since the 19th century. But even before Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election vowing to cut immigration, migration to the United States was slowing. The Great Recession dried up many jobs that drew workers to the country, legally or illegally. Rising standards of living in Latin America have prodded more people to stay put — or to return from the United States. Flores, who runs a chain of Mexican restaurants as well as his barbecue restaurant, said while the COVID-19 pandemic was a bigger shock to his industry, the immigration slowdown has hit it hard — and not just for meatpackers that supply his restaurant’s brisket. “You’ve got a lot of positions that aren’t being filled,” he said. He’s steadily raised pay, up to $15 an hour recently. “This is a culmination of years and years,” said Flores, who’s president of the Greater Houston Restaurant Association. Helle, who raises onion, cabbage, melons and kale just outside the border town of McAllen, Texas, is also paying more to his workers, who are almost exclusively immigrants. People born in the U.S., he says, won’t work the fields regardless of the pay. Before he could find farmworkers just in the region. Now he’s joined a federal program to bring agricultural workers across the border. It’s more expensive for him, but he said it’s the only way he can keep his crops from spoiling in the ground. Helle, 60, has farmed the area for decades. “I live 10 miles from the Rio Grande river and I never in my life thought we’d be in this situation.”"
4,Lindsey Graham Grovels On Fox News Over Leaked Audio Of Him Praising Joe Biden,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Asked on Fox News to explain his recently revealed praise of President Joe Biden on Jan. 6, 2021, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) predictably resorted to criticizing Biden and flattering Donald Trump. On Tuesday, CNN aired audio of Graham speaking to New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin in the hours after the Capitol riot. During the exchange, Graham said the country would eventually move on from the incident and realize “we’re better than this.” He added that Biden would likely be the best person to lead the country forward. “Yeah, totally, he’ll be maybe the best person to have, right? I mean, how mad can you get at Joe Biden?” he said in the recording. Graham was pressed on the comments Thursday during an appearance on “Jesse Watters Primetime.” “Joe Biden. The best person to have? Do you really believe that?” Watters asked him. Graham said “I was wrong.” “I’ve known Joe for 30 years,” he said. “He’s a nice guy, but he’s been a disaster as president.” He added: “This was literally happening on the day of January the 6th and I was hoping that President Biden would bring us together ... But not only has he failed to bring us together, he has made us less safe. He’s ruined our economy. All the bad guys are moving around the world.” He then pivoted to a common Republican refrain, suggesting that Trump projected more strength on the global stage. “They didn’t do this on Trump’s watch because they were afraid of him,” he said. “Nobody fears Joe Biden abroad, and at home his policies are failing.” Watters left the questioning at that, though he swiped at Graham for “speaking to New York Times reporters.” “If I was a senator, I’d never do it,” Watters quipped. Graham called that “very good advice.” Graham’s feelings about the attack have apparently lessened dramatically since the day it happened, when he condemned Trump on the Senate floor, telling colleagues: “All I can say is count me out. Enough is enough.” In the following months, he reverted to sucking up to Trump. By the one-year anniversary of the siege, he was accusing Biden of “brazen politicization” of the attack. The audio was released to promote a new book, “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future,” authored by Martin and fellow Times reporter Alexander Burns.

5,GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn Receives A Brutal Reminder After Veterans Tweet,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Far-right Rep. Madison Cawthorn’s tweet evoking veterans backfired. The North Carolina Republican appeared to criticize House approval of $40 billion in aid for Ukraine with this post on Wednesday: Imagine if we spent $40 Billion on veterans. In response, he received a series of searing reminders of his own votes against bills that assist former U.S. military service members. “DON’T EVEN pretend you care about Veterans,” responded VoteVets, a progressive PAC promoting Democratic military veterans for Congress.

6,Laura Ingraham Asks Why There Was No Hoarding Under Trump. Twitter Explodes.,social-justice," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Laura Ingraham asked with a straight face on Thursday why there was no hoarding under former President Donald Trump, prompting outraged people on Twitter to jog the Fox News host’s memory. (Watch the video below.) Ingraham used the current baby formula shortage to assert her blatant falsehood. A recall by a major formula manufacturer has exacerbated an already stressed supply chain, prompting retailers to limit purchases. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced actions to mitigate the crunch, and outgoing White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration has called on stores to impose restrictions “to prevent the possibility of hoarding.” “We know that is an issue,” Psaki added in the clip Ingraham showed Thursday night. Ingraham then asked with a smug cackle: “Why didn’t we have hoarding during the Trump administration?” Her guests, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and conservative author Horace Cooper, heartily agreed.

8,Elon Musk Reveals What He Thinks Of Trump Running In 2024,social-justice," Reporter, HuffPost Elon Musk wants Donald Trump back on Twitter, but that doesn’t mean he’s in favor of Trump retaking the White House. “Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter,” tweeted the billionaire Tesla CEO, who said Friday he’s pausing his $44 billion purchase of the platform but “remains committed.” Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter Musk suggested on Thursday that President Joe Biden was elected because people wanted a break from the nonstop controversies of the Trump administration. “Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country,” he wrote, adding: “But actually everyone just wanted less drama.” Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama Musk, a self-described champion of “free speech,” has said he’ll take Twitter private on completion of his purchase. Twitter banned Trump in January 2021 for inciting the U.S. Capitol riot. He frequently used the platform to peddle lies, attack enemies and divide the nation. Last week, Musk claimed Trump’s removal from Twitter was a mistake. “I think it was a morally bad decision to be clear and foolish in the extreme,” he said, adding it “alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice.” Trump, though, has said he won’t return to Twitter and instead will focus on using his own struggling Truth Social network.

9,Jail Time? Ex-Prosecutor Names The Law Kevin McCarthy Should Be Worried About.,social-justice," Overnight Editor, HuffPost A former federal prosecutor says House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and several other GOP lawmakers may have committed a very specific crime in their possible attempts to cover up Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 plot to overturn his election defeat. “It’s called misprision of a felony,” Glenn Kirschner, who spent 24 years as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, explained on his YouTube channel. The law says someone who has knowledge of a felony that’s “cognizable by a court of the United States” but doesn’t come forward with information about it could face up to three years in prison. Kirshner noted that a federal judge in March determined it “more likely than not” that Trump “corruptly attempted to obstruct” the Jan. 6 vote certification by Congress. That makes potential Jan. 6-related crimes “cognizable by a court” ― and significant now that McCarthy and four other GOP lawmakers linked to Trump have been subpoenaed by the House Jan. 6 committee to answer questions about their knowledge and involvement. If they refuse to comply, Kirshner said, it “looks like misprision of a felony to me.” He added: “Also looks like accessory after the fact. Also looks like they are criminal co-conspirators with Donald Trump in his conspiracy to defraud or commit crimes against the United States.” “So many crimes to choose from,” he concluded.

10,Afghan Evacuees Face Serious Struggles Without Congressional Help,social-justice," Afghan Fellow, HuffPost The 76,000 Afghans who were airlifted out of their country and relocated to the U.S. last year have made a fresh start in the U.S. But they have no guarantee of staying unless Congress passes legislation that would offer a pathway to legal status for the Afghans who were forced to flee. Evacuees and their allies are holding a day of action on Thursday to push for lawmakers to include legal status for Afghans in the U.S. as part of a broader budget bill that largely focuses on relief for Ukraine. President Joe Biden called for including Afghans in the legislation, and some lawmakers have voiced their support. But numerous attempts to include this version of the measure, called the Afghan Adjustment Act, have failed due to objections from Senate Republicans. If it’s omitted again, Afghans who were welcomed by the U.S. when it pulled out of their country, leaving the Taliban to take over, will be left to fend for themselves here. The two main options for long-term protection available to Afghans are asylum and special immigrant status — both complicated, potentially costly and uncertain processes. “I can’t even plan my life and business for more than a year here,” Maryam Yousufi, a journalist and entrepreneur who is now settled in Washington, D.C., said in an interview. Yousufi was a well-known face in the Afghan media, having worked with many local and international platforms, including the U.S.-funded Voice of America. She started a small business designing and selling traditional luxury Afghan clothing to local and international consumers only a year before Kabul fell. “You have life, you have family and you have business, and all of a sudden you have to leave all of them behind to seek protection somewhere else,” Yousufi said. Yousufi is working to restart her business after months of struggling to settle down in the U.S. She had some of her products shipped to the U.S. and is now looking to register her brand here. “This is a new beginning for me, and I’m excited about it,” she said. Now she just needs to ensure she can continue. The protection for Yousufi is just temporary. Last August, the Biden administration used a measure known as humanitarian parole to allow Afghans to enter the U.S. for a two-year period. Parole status is not recognized as an immigration status, and there is no road to permanent residency for those who enter the country on parole. Since the parole status is temporary, these Afghans must adjust their status — which means obtaining a green card, asylum or some other visa — in order to stay long-term and avoid possible deportation. “The worst-case scenario for Afghans unable to adjust their status is that the current temporary protection options expire and they are unable to find another pathway,” said Sarah Ivory, president of USAHello, a nonprofit working for refugees. “In this case, they would become undocumented and risk deportation.” The Biden administration announced in March the designation of temporary protected status, or TPS, for any Afghans residing in the U.S. as of March 15. This protects Afghan parolees from having to return to unsafe conditions — but it would only extend the temporary protection and does not guarantee permanent residency. Permanent residency and eventual citizenship do not just protect people from deportation. It would also allow them to apply to bring relatives to the U.S., something many Afghans are desperate to do. “My wife and children are in danger [in Afghanistan], and I want to bring them over as soon as possible,” Sultanzai, who requested that his full name not be used for security concerns, said. Sultanzai is a former member of Afghan security forces who worked closely with the American forces in eastern Afghanistan for eight years until 2018. He was flown to the U.S. last August and now lives in the D.C. area. Sultanzai had been on the Taliban’s “kill list” for years, and many of his comrades had been ruthlessly killed in recent years. Rather than endangering his family’s safety on the road to Kabul, he ventured out alone to see if he could track down his former superiors first and get his loved ones on a flight out later. He was able to get into the airport, but was immediately boarded on a flight. It was too late to help his family. He recalled someone telling him during boarding, “Save yourself first, then bring your family later.” But he’s not sure how to do it. One of the ways that Afghan parolees are able to adjust their status to a more permanent status is through the special immigrant visa (SIV) program. Evacuees who apply have to be employed for at least one year by an approved entity and also get a letter from their supervisor in support. “I feel abandoned and confused,” Sultanzai said. He said his American supervisors guaranteed him an SIV when he worked with them. He has enough certificates and photos to prove that he worked with the Americans, but he is unable to obtain a letter of support from them because he has been out of his post for several years and he lost his contacts. “They all vanished, no email address, no phone number,” Sultanzai said. His inability to communicate in English also prevents him from reaching out to others who may assist him. Many Afghans are currently in various stages of obtaining an SIV and are unsure of their next steps. Yousufi would also like to pursue SIV status based on her work with Voice of America. But she has only received her initial approval after four months and has yet to file a petition. The program has a backlog of tens of thousands of applications, making it even more difficult for SIV applicants to adjust their status in time, especially those who recently applied to the program. Those who do not qualify for the SIV program must petition for asylum. The majority of Afghan parolees have only four months left to file an asylum petition, which is currently the only option for most of them to adjust their status. All asylum applicants must apply within one year of their last entry into the U.S. SIV applicants are also considering applying for asylum during these next four months because there has been no progress on their application and they don’t want to wait any longer. “I don’t want to risk waiting to hear from SIV,” said Yousufi. She has only a few months left to find legal help, prepare documents and submit her petitions. But like the SIV program, the asylum system is extremely backlogged, demanding and hard to navigate. There was already a 400,000-case backlog of asylum applications before the arrival of this wave of Afghans in the U.S. “Asylum is a very high threshold to meet,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, a group that aids refugees and migrants. The petitioner must have enough documentation to prove that they are personally at risk of persecution if they were to return to their home country. These documents may not be available to Afghans, who had to pass through Taliban checkpoints on their way out of the country. “Some [asylum-seekers] may have even destroyed documents that would be helpful in an asylum proceeding, but a death sentence in the hands of the Taliban.” “Some may have even destroyed documents that would be helpful in an asylum proceeding, but a death sentence in the hands of the Taliban,” Vignarajah said. Navigating the asylum process in the U.S. is nearly impossible without the assistance of an immigration lawyer. There aren’t enough pro bono lawyers to help the tens of thousands of Afghans in such a short time. Plus, most Afghans do not have the financial resources to pay thousands of dollars in legal fees. “Their cases could be rejected,” Ivory said. “ Especially if they do not have legal support in putting together their petition.” For Afghans like Sultanzai who lack English skills, navigating the process could be even harder. Many Afghans are unaware that they must apply for asylum before it is too late. The resettlement agencies that assisted Afghans in filing for basic resettlement needs such as housing and food programs only offer support for 90 days. The rest is on them. Sultanzai has not been able to find legal support yet. “I don’t even know what to do next,” he said. Biden called on Congress last week to pass legislation that would help Afghan parolees to adjust their status as part of his request for emergency supplemental funding for Ukraine. Refugee groups urged their members to call representatives and share their stories on Thursday to push for Congress to include them in the funding. “We need everyone across our country calling into their representatives and senators to ask them to include this in the Ukrainian supplemental,” Shawn VanDiver, the founder and board chair of AfghanEvac, a coalition of organizations helping at-risk Afghans relocate and resettle, told HuffPost. “This is the shot we have. There won’t be another opportunity until 2023 and neither Afghans or the veterans who they stood with can wait that long. We need this to happen now and we need folks on both sides to not play partisan games.” Advocacy groups have been urging Congress to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act for months as a way out of the limbo in which Afghans find themselves. If passed, this would give Afghan parolees a direct route to lawful permanent residency, bypassing all other options, including SIV and asylum. “The Afghan Adjustment Act would create a fast track for Afghans that would acknowledge that, by virtue of their evacuation and the events that have unfolded, they already meet the standards for humanitarian protection,” Ivory said. Advocates hope the White House’s latest request will help. “This request is a promising sign for the legislation’s chances of passing,” Vignarajah said.“We remain hopeful that Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle recognize the urgency and moral imperative to do right by those who fought and served alongside us in Afghanistan.” But sources in the Senate told HuffPost that numerous attempts to include this version of the Afghan Adjustment Act have failed due to objections from Senate Republicans. “Given that, its future is uncertain in the supplemental as well,” said one staffer, who requested anonymity to discuss the situation. “We shall see.” Afghan Fellow, HuffPost"
11,"Like Many Mothers, I'm Returning To Work After The Pandemic. But I Wasn’t Welcomed Back.",social-justice," Guest Writer Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I slogged away as a Ph.D. student, a primary parent of two young daughters, and an occupational therapist with two jobs: one as a part-time outpatient OT at a hand therapy clinic, and one at the local hospital in the pediatric intensive care unit on weekends. I was furloughed from my position as an outpatient OT at the beginning of the pandemic, and I needed to remain home with my two daughters anyway when schools closed. While we hunkered down, they watched ungodly amounts of TV and I miraculously finished my dissertation. (My kindergartner did not fare as well academically on Zoom school.) I defended my dissertation anticlimactically via Zoom, wearing a button-up and slippers. I came downstairs a doctor, and immediately needed to clean up homemade slime from the floor. After nine months of picking up on-call weekends at the hospital, I found a part-time research position where I could work from home. My daughters, 4 and 7 at the time, were still at home due to school closures, so working from home was a necessity. I wasn’t alone in this situation. Following the onset of COVID, women left the workforce in droves for these same reasons. Even for those whose jobs could be performed at home, many were driven out by the added demands of household management and caring for children who were suddenly home from school and day care. Even once my children’s schools reopened, any COVID symptom could still require them to stay home, which added a spontaneous spin to the game I called “How Much Can I Work This Week.” My younger daughter likes to crawl on the bathroom floor (because she’s a kitten, obviously) and then lick her hands, causing her to develop approximately 295 colds per year and take subsequent sick days off school. I also needed to be ready at any given moment to pick my kids up when there was an inevitable positive case in one of their classrooms, lest they marinate in a COVID petri dish a moment longer. While I felt grateful for my remote research position, especially with my kitten-human hybrid child and her perpetually runny nose, I desperately missed the connection with patients ― and I needed more hours of work. Around this time, someone actually asked me whether finding a new job would be “fair to the employer,” given the unpredictability of my schedule amid the roller coaster of school closures and COVID waves. I mourned the losses suffered by women in the workplace as data emerged and headlines read “Coronavirus child-care crisis will set women back a generation.” I’d worked tirelessly my entire adult life to earn advanced degrees, and yet in a blink, they seemed inconsequential. I felt I had failed at expanding my daughters’ understanding of what women were capable of, an effort generations in the making. A year and a half into the pandemic, I finally returned to steady inpatient hospital work during the week, once my daughters’ school schedules felt relatively reliable. I assumed everyone would be understanding of my interrupted professional life, given the upheavals we’d all presumably experienced in the COVID era. I was assigned to a new department, which I was very excited about. There, it soon became evident that I was expected not only to learn new clinical skills, navigate the culture of the department and refresh my lost self, but to do so quickly. Where I had expected empathy, I was instead greeted with hostility, apathy and criticism about the gap in my patient care experience. I was told I lacked “basic” skills (after 10+ years in the field), and that my “break” from clinical care was detrimental. “This is why full-time is different from weekends,” a supervisor sneered, as if I’d recently returned from vacation. Being a parent during the pandemic had required a total paradigm shift in my work, yet the outside world seemed unchanged. Naturally, the people who said such things were not parents themselves. They found it difficult to understand what parents experienced during the pandemic, like the gravity of our professional despair as our lives revolved around homeschooling and the monotony of making snacks every nine minutes. At work, I cared for infants. It was not lost on me that my ability to quickly develop a rapport with new mothers, and provide personal insight into the trials of breastfeeding, came from the same parent who’d spent the previous two years keeping a family alive, psychologically safe and intellectually stimulated. The employer enjoyed the former skill set, but not the latter. Within two months, it became evident that I was not welcome to bring my whole self to this position. I attempted to salvage my role, to no avail. I left the hospital altogether two months after that. I continued working remotely part-time, doing research for my other institution. But I did not want to completely leave patient care behind. I’ve recently started part-time at a new hospital, and have been met with flexible scheduling and photos of colleagues’ children, which felt like a warm hug. This phase of the pandemic is providing the opportunity for more women to return to work— but only if they are welcomed. It may take a beat for the mothers who left the workforce in 2020 to regain our professional footing. Some of us may have years-long gaps on our resumes due to caring for children, parents or other dependents, responsibilities that often fall to women. Companies need to expect this, plan for it, and consider it another casualty of the pandemic, rather than a reflection of a woman’s capabilities. This is necessary to reclaim the net 5.4 million women’s jobs we lost during the pandemic. Of course, I am beyond fortunate. I was not trapped with an abuser during this time. I have a partner and that partner kept his job. In general, Black and Latina women fared far worse than white women when it comes to employment. I also want to recognize that some male parents stayed at home with their children during the pandemic. For many, though, the pandemic drove families into antiquated gender stereotypes. It’s likely that COVID is not over, and that a new wave will be upon us soon. Parents again may need to leave work at a moment’s notice when a COVID case forces a child’s classroom to close. Organizations need to work proactively to welcome mothers back into the workforce nonetheless. Otherwise, we are actively supporting our collective regression into generations past. We are effectively undoing our mothers’ and grandmothers’ and great-grandmothers’ battles to give women a choice. I, and the many other moms who’ve had to take time out of the workforce, need your grace and understanding. This might take the form of flexible work schedules, awareness of important meetings held in the late afternoon or early evening, or a mutually agreed-upon timeline of skill acquisition. We need help easing the transition, and empathy about the gaps in our work experience. In many ways, the pandemic stripped away the illusion of boundaries between work and home. We can no longer work like we don’t have children, or parent like we don’t have jobs. We are bringing our whole selves to work, and we deserve respect for our experiences, including motherhood.

12,Sydney Man Gets 12 Years For Pushing Gay American Off A Cliff In 1988,social-justice," CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — An Australian man was sentenced to 12 years and seven months in prison Tuesday for the 1988 murder of an American who fell off a Sydney cliff that was known as a gay meeting place. The death of mathematician Scott Johnson was initially called a suicide, but his family pressed for further investigation. A coroner in 2017 found a number of assaults, some fatal, where the victims had been targeted because they were thought to be gay. Scott White, 51, pleaded guilty in January and could have been sentenced to up to life in prison. Justice Helen Wilson said she did not find beyond reasonable doubt that the murder was a gay hate crime, an aggravating factor that would have led to a longer sentence. She also said she applied more lenient sentencing patterns in place in New South Wales state in the late 1980s. He must serve at least eight years and three months in prison before he can be considered for parole. White was 18 and homeless when he met 27-year-old Los Angeles-born Johnson at a bar in suburban Manly in December 1988 and went with him to a nearby cliff top at North Head. White’s former wife Helen White told police in 2019 that her then-husband had bragged about beating gay men and had said the only good gay man was a dead gay man. She told the court on Monday that her husband had told her Johnson had run off the cliff. Scott White told police that he was himself gay and frightened that his homophobic brother would find out. Wilson said it was not possible to draw any conclusions beyond a reasonable doubt about what had happened at the clifftop. “The offender hit Dr. Johnson, causing him to stumble backwards and leave the cliff edge,” Wilson said. “In those seconds when he must have realized what was happening to him, Dr. Johnson must have been terrified, aware that he would strike the rocks below and conscious of his fate,” Wilson added. “It was a terrible death.” Wilson did not accept the defense lawyers’ argument that Helen White had been motivated to report him to police by a reward. Under cross-examination on Monday, Helen White denied she had been aware of a 1 million Australian dollar ($704,000) reward for information on Johnson’s murder when she went to police in 2019. She said she only became aware of a reward when the victim’s brother, Steve Johnson, doubled the sum in 2020. Outside court, Boston resident Steve Johnson thanked prosecutors and the judicial system for ensuring White was sent to prison. “We didn’t get compensation for Scott this week but what Scott got was dignity,” the older sibling told reporters. Younger sister Rebecca Johnson said she was satisfied with the sentence. “Today I feel like we’ve had answers and we’ve had justice, and that’s for our brother and that’s for gay men who were bashed or killed in that era,” she said. White had a record of violent crime before and after the murder but had not committed any offense since 2008. “It should be understood that the court is not sentencing a violent and reckless young man for a targeted attack on a gay man,” Wilson said. “Because of the lapse of time, the offender is no longer the same angry young man who raised his fists to another on the edge of a cliff. Neither is the court imposing a sentence for a crime motivated by hatred for a particular sector of society. The evidence is too slender to support that,” Wilson added. She said a sentence for the same crime today would be “much higher.” White’s lawyers have appealed his conviction and hope he will be acquitted of the murder charge in a jury trial. A coroner ruled in 2017 that Johnson “fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence by unidentified persons who attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.” The coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some men were also robbed. A coroner had ruled in 1989 that Johnson had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died. Johnson studied at universities in California and at Cambridge in Britain before moving to Australia in 1986 to live with his Australian partner Michael Noone. They lived in Canberra where Johnson studied at the Australian National University which posthumously awarded him a Ph.D. He was staying a Noone’s parents’ Sydney home when he died."
13,Sydney Man Admits Pushing Gay American Off A Cliff In 1988,social-justice," CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A man told police he killed American mathematician Scott Johnson in 1988 by pushing the 27-year-old off a Sydney cliff in what prosecutors describe as a gay hate crime, a court heard on Monday. Scott White, 51, appeared in the New South Wales state Supreme Court for a sentencing hearing after he pleaded guilty in January to the murder of the Los Angeles-born Canberra resident, whose death at the base of a North Head cliff was initially dismissed by police as suicide. White will be sentenced by Justice Helen Wilson on Tuesday. He faces a potential sentence of life in prison. “I pushed a bloke. He went over the edge,” White said in recorded police interview in 2020 that was played in court. White said in the interview he lied when he had earlier told police that he had tried to grab Johnson and prevent his fatal fall. A coroner ruled in 2017 that Johnson “fell from the clifftop as a result of actual or threatened violence by unidentified persons who attacked him because they perceived him to be homosexual.” The coroner also found that gangs of men roamed various Sydney locations in search of gay men to assault, resulting in the deaths of some victims. Some people were also robbed. A coroner had ruled in 1989 that the openly gay man had taken his own life, while a second coroner in 2012 could not explain how he died. His Boston-based brother Steve Johnson maintained pressure for further investigation and offered his own reward of 1 million Australian dollars ($704,000) for information. White was charged in 2020 and police say the reward will likely be collected. White’s former wife Helen White told the court that her then-husband “bragged” to their children of beating gay men at the clifftop well-known for gay meetups. Helen White said she read a newspaper report in 2008 about Johnson’s death and asked her husband if he was responsible. “It’s not my fault,” Scott White allegedly replied. “The dumb (expletive) ran off the cliff.” “I said, ‘It is if you chased him,’” Helen White told the court. She said her husband did not reply. Under cross-examination, Helen White denied she had been aware of a AU$1 million reward for information on Johnson’s murder when she reported her former husband to police in 2019. She said she only became aware of a reward when the victim’s brother, Steve Johnson, doubled the sum in 2020. Steve Johnson said in his victim impact statement that, “With a vicious push, Mr. White took Scott and he vanished.” “This man (Scott Johnson) who once told me he could never hurt someone even in self-defense died in terror,” the brother added. Steve Johnson said he appreciated White’s guilty plea. “If he had turned himself in after his violent action, I would have had a little more sympathy. If he had grasped Scott’s hand and pulled him to safety, I would owe him everlasting gratitude,” the brother said, his voice choked with emotion. Scott Johnson’s sisters Terry and Rebecca Johnson, his partner Michael Noone and Steve Johnson’s wife Rosemarie Johnson also gave victim impact statements. Rosemarie Johnson described the initial police failure to investigate Scott Johnson’s death as “indefensible and inhumane.” Rebecca Johnson, a younger sister, said the police report of suicide “made no sense.” “How could a community fail so spectacularly that they created boys capable of such horror?” she asked, referring to media reports of gay beatings in Sydney being described as a sport. Prosecutor Brett Hatfield said the precise details of the murder were not known and that White’s accounts had varied. White had met Johnson in a nearby bar in suburban Manly and Johnson had stripped naked at the clifftop before he died, Hatfield said. He said the gravity of the murder was significantly elevated because it was motivated by the victim’s sexuality. White’s lawyer Belinda Rigg said her client was gay and had been concerned that his homophobic brother would find out. In January, White yelled repeatedly in court during a pre-trial hearing that he was guilty, having previously denied the crime. His lawyers will appeal that plea in the Court of Criminal Appeals and hope he will be acquitted at trial. Scott Johnson was a doctoral student at Australian National University and lived in Canberra. He was staying at Noone’s parents’ Sydney home when he died."
14,Christians Aid Migrants Because Church Is Run By Satan: Marjorie Taylor Greene,social-justice," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) recently told a far-right Catholic media organization that “Satan’s controlling the church” of Christians who provide aid to undocumented immigrants. The extremist lawmaker, whose website boasts of her “strong Christian faith,” sat down for an interview Thursday with right-wing activist Michael Voris, founder of Church Militant. In a clip from the interview released by the group Right Wing Watch, Voris asked Greene about Catholic organizations in the U.S. that use federal funding to help resettle undocumented immigrants and refugees. “I thought we had a separation of church and state,” Greene said in response. “What it is, is Satan’s controlling the church,” she continued. “The church is not doing its job, and it’s not adhering to the teachings of Christ, and it’s not adhering to what the word of God says we’re supposed to do and how we’re supposed to live.” She added that Christian groups that say you should take care of migrants are “destroying our laws” and taking advantage of Americans. “Yes, we are supposed to love one another, but their definition of what love one another means, means destroying our laws,” she said. “It means completely perverting what our Constitution says. It means taking unreal advantage of the American taxpayer. And it means pushing a globalist policy on the American people and forcing America to become something that we are not supposed to be.” She also suggested that the U.S. government should sever foreign aid to the home countries of undocumented immigrants who are “illegally invading.” “We should hold those countries accountable,” she said. “‘Oh, I’m sorry, Guatemala, you’re not getting a check this year because you’ve sent X number of thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of people to illegally invade our country as if they’re an army.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene says that Christian organizations are working to resettle undocumented immigrants and refugees in the U.S. because ""Satan's  controlling the church."" https://t.co/cbnTrbOjuY pic.twitter.com/3N3X72ZLgc Greene’s comments earned a rebuke from the Catholic League, an organization that defends the religious and civil rights of Catholics. In a statement, the group’s president, Bill Donohue, called Greene “a disgrace” and said she needed to apologize immediately. “She had plenty of opportunities to make rational criticisms of the agency, but instead she slandered the entire Catholic Church,” he said. “We are contacting House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy about this matter. He’s got a loose cannon on his hands.” Voris, a devout supporter of former President Donald Trump, has claimed that Catholics support men like Trump because they “no longer see any trace of masculinity in their religious leaders.” In 2020, he warned that not voting for Trump would result in Christians being “identified, hunted down, declared ‘illegal’ for some made-up reason.” “Don’t be expressing your regrets as you’re herded onto the trains heading for the camps,” he wrote. In Church Militant’s write-up of Greene’s interview, it declared she was “universally despised by the Marxist Left for her straight shooting and belief in Christ” and claimed that was the reason Greene’s critics are “using trumped-up accusations about Jan. 6” to block her from running for reelection. The day after the interview, Greene testified in a hearing about whether she is qualified to run for reelection in Georgia. She is accused of assisting the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which could be considered a violation of the 14th Amendment prohibition on members of Congress taking part in an “insurrection or rebellion.” She faces a lawsuit from a group of her constituents represented by Free Speech for People, an organization that advocates for fair elections.

15,Judge Halts Preparations For End Of Title 42 U.S. Asylum Limits,social-justice," NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The Biden administration must stop what amounts to the phasing out a pandemic-related public health rule allowing the expulsion of migrants without giving them an opportunity to seek asylum, a federal judge in Louisiana ruled Wednesday. The administration plans to end the policy outright on May 23. But it acknowledged in recent court filings that it has recently processed more single adults from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador under immigration laws — which include rights to seek asylum — instead of the public health policy. U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays, in Lafayette, issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday, saying the administration must stop the stepped-up processing for at least the next two weeks. He also said in his ruling that states suing to stop the termination of the public health policy are likely to succeed in court. Twenty-two states are challenging plans to keep the administration from ending the expulsion policy, which was put in place under former President Donald Trump’s administration in 2020 in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Louisiana, Arizona and 19 other states filed suit in U.S. District Court in Lafayette, Louisiana. Texas filed a similar suit in Victoria, Texas, on Friday. Summerhays, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump, presides over the Louisiana-based case in Lafayette. He has scheduled a May 13 hearing on the larger issue of whether President Joe Biden can end the pandemic migration rule. The plaintiff states had asked him last week to issue an order blocking the administration from processing more migrants under immigration law instead of the public health rule. About 14% of single adults from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were processed under immigration laws during a seven-day period ending last Thursday, the administration had acknowledged. That’s up from only 5% in March, according to government figures. “Under this temporary restraining order. Defendants are required to return to policies and practices in place prior to the issuance of the Termination Order, which should have the result (all else being equal) of returning to historical practices in line with historical benchmarks,” Summerhays wrote. Migrants have been expelled more than 1.8 million times under the rule invoked in March 2020. Advocates for asylum-seekers support the end to the rule, which they say endangers people fleeing persecution back home and violates rights to seek protection under U.S. law and international treaty. The states challenging the administration say the U.S. is not ready for a likely influx of migrants resulting from the rule’s end, straining public services and economies. At two often-contentious hearings Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas sought to defend the administration’s handling of an increase migrants at the Southwest border and its plans to deal with the prospect of more with the potential end of Title 42. Mayorkas sought to push back on Republican accusations that the Biden administration has encouraged irregular migration by allowing some people to seek asylum, blaming economic and political turmoil and violence throughout Latin America and the world. “Some of the causes of irregular migration have only been heightened by years of distress preceding this administration,” he said. ___ Associated Press reporter Ben Fox in Washington contributed to this story.
