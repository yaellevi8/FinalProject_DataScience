1,"Mike Pence Breaks With Trump, Will Campaign With Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp",politics," NEW YORK (AP) — Former Vice President Mike Pence will campaign with Georgia’s incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp the day before this month’s GOP primary in his most significant political break with former President Donald Trump to date. Kemp’s campaign announced Friday morning that Pence will headline a get-out-the-vote rally for Kemp on Monday, May 23rd, the day before the vote. That puts Pence in direct conflict with Trump-endorsed candidate David Perdue, who has been trailing in the polls. Kemp is one of Trump’s top targets this election cycle because of his refusal to cooperate with Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. “Brian Kemp is my friend, a man dedicated to faith, family and the people of Georgia,” Pence said in a statement. “I am proud to offer my full support for four more years of Brian Kemp as governor of the great state of Georgia!” The news comes as Pence has taken steps to distance himself from Trump as the former congressman and Indiana governor considers a 2024 presidential run that could put him into direct competition with his former boss. That has included calling out Trump by name. In February, Pence said Trump was “wrong” to insist that Pence had the power to unilaterally overturn the results of the 2020 election — a power vice presidents do not possess. In a separate speech before top Republican donors, Pence urged the GOP to move on from Trump’s 2020 election grievances and said there was “no room in this party for apologists” for Vladimir Putin after Trump praised the Russian leader’s maneuvering as “genius” before his brutal invasion of Ukraine. “Elections are about the future,” Pence said in March. “My fellow Republicans, we can only win if we are united around an optimistic vision for the future based on our highest values. We cannot win by fighting yesterday’s battles, or by relitigating the past.” A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Pence’s plans. But Trump this week panned a trio of current and former Republican governors, including New Jersey’s Chris Christie, as “RINOs” — or “Republicans in Name Only” — for supporting Kemp. “That tells you all you need to know about what you are getting in Georgia—just a continuation of bad elections and a real RINO if you vote for Brian Kemp,” Trump said. “Maybe the “R” in RINO really stands for re-elected,” Christie quipped back. The Georgia race is a gamble for Trump, who notched a major victory in Ohio earlier this month when JD Vance, the candidate he endorsed, came from behind to win a competitive GOP Senate primary. But last week, his pick for governor in Nebraska, Charles Herbster, lost his primary amid groping allegations. And Trump faces further challenges ahead, including in Pennsylvania next week, where his pick for Senate, celebrity heart surgeon Mehmet Oz, is locked in a tight, three-way race. Kemp had been substantially ahead of Perdue in polls in March and April, and many expect Kemp will be able to prevail without a June runoff, which would be triggered if no candidate won a majority of the vote. Perdue, a former senator, has also been lagging in fundraising and had about $900,000 cash on hand on April 30, less than a month before the May 24 primary, while Kemp had $10.7 million. The winner will face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has raised more than $20 million so far and had $8 million in cash on April 30. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

2,Mixed Texas Ruling Allows Transgender Youth Abuse Investigations,politics," AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Supreme Court on Friday allowed the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse while also ruling in favor of one family that was among the first contacted by child welfare officials following an order by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The court did not rule on the merits of the investigations — which were the first of its kind in the U.S. — only that lower courts in Texas overstepped by trying to block all cases from going forward. The mixed ruling by Texas’ highest civil court, which is entirely controlled by nine elected Republican justices, comes at a moment when GOP lawmakers across the U.S. are accelerating efforts to impose restrictions on transgender rights. Lambada Legal, which helped bring the lawsuit against Texas on behalf of the parents of the 16-year-old girl, called the decision a win because it put the state’s investigation into their family on hold. Although the ruling does not prevent Texas from launching investigations into other families, the state would be foolish to do so now because those families could also seek an injunction, said Omar Gonzalez-Paden, counsel and health care strategist for Lambada Legal. “It would be both futile and a complete waste of resources for them to do so,” Gonzalez-Paden said. Texas went farther than any state in February when Abbott issued a first-of-its-kind order that instructed child welfare officials to investigate reports of gender-confirming care for kids as abuse. A judge in Austin put that order on hold after a lawsuit brought on behalf of the the 16-year-old girl whose family said the state was already investigating their family. It was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal. The lawsuit marked the first report of parents being investigated following Abbott’s directive and an earlier nonbinding legal opinion by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton labeling certain gender-confirming treatments as “child abuse.” The Texas Department of Family and Protective Service has said it opened nine investigations following the directive and opinion. Across the country, Republicans have leaned into the debates over transgender rights as LGBTQ Americans have grown increasingly visible in society and pop culture. In March, the Arizona Legislature passed bills to prohibit gender confirmation surgery for minors and ban transgender athletes from playing on girls sports teams, and Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed them. Two other GOP governors in Indiana and Utah  bucked their party and vetoed legislation to ban transgender players from girls sports. In Texas, the groups bringing the lawsuit also represent a clinical psychologist who has said the governor’s directive forces her to choose between reporting clients to the state or losing her license and other penalties. The governor’s directive and Paxton’s opinion go against the nation’s largest medical groups, including the American Medical Association, which have opposed Republican-backed restrictions on transgender people filed in statehouses nationwide.

3,Jen Psaki Says She'll Miss Fox News' Peter Doocy Ahead Of Final White House Briefing,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she’ll miss Peter Doocy, the White House correspondent for Fox News, after she steps down following her last briefing from the podium on Friday. “I will,” Psaki responded Thursday to a question about Doocy at an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. “I think we have a very good professional relationship and I understand that he’s coming there to ask questions every day that are important to report and the outlet he works for, and I respect that, and we have healthy debates and discussions,” Psaki said. Psaki added this “doesn’t mean I agree with his line of questioning on most days,” but she said she still answered Doocy’s questions. Doocy appeared to share the sentiment last week when Psaki announced her departure. “Sorry to see you go,” Doocy said when Psaki called on him. “Are you?” Psaki replied. “Yes, and you’ve always been a good sport,” Doocy replied, thanking Psaki for her service. The pair have repeatedly clashed, most recently over a question by Doocy on the absence of a mask requirement in the White House briefing room. “Well, Peter, I’m not a doctor, you’re not a doctor — that I’m aware of .... OK, not a doctor,” Psaki said. “Nor does he play one on TV — most days.” This wasn’t the first time the adversarial relationship attracted attention. During an interview with the “Pod Save America” podcast, the press secretary was asked if Doocy was “a stupid son of a bitch,” as President Joe Biden was caught muttering on a hot mic in January. “He works for a network that provides people with questions that ― nothing personal to any individual, including Peter Doocy ― but might make anyone sound like a stupid son of a bitch,” Psaki replied. This prompted a response from Fox News. “His questions are his own, he is a terrific reporter and we are extremely proud of his work,” a spokesperson said. Psaki, after her final press briefing, will be replaced by her deputy, Karine Jean-Pierre, who will make history as the first Black woman and first openly gay person in the role.

5,Video Shows Police Fatally Shoot Grandmother With Dementia In New Mexico Home,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Police in New Mexico have released disturbing body camera footage showing an officer fatally shooting a 75-year-old woman with dementia in her home last month. Warning to readers: The video, below, is graphic and disturbing. The woman, Amelia Baca, had become agitated at family members in the Las Cruces home when her daughter called the police for help on April 16. According to family members, Baca was having a mental health crisis. In body camera video released Tuesday by the city of Las Cruces in response to a public records request, an officer can be seen pointing a gun at Baca through the doorway of the home moments after arriving on the scene. Baca, who family members said did not speak English, is holding two kitchen knives and shouting in Spanish. The officer repeatedly shouts at her in English to “drop the knife,” “drop the fucking knife,” “do it now.” After 38 seconds, he tells her to “put the fucking knife down” and fires two shots at her. She died at the scene. The video is below. It is graphic. The body camera footage begins with the officer arriving at the house. As he approaches the front door, he asks two women — Baca’s daughter and grandmother — to step outside. The granddaughter, Albitar Inoh, tells the officer, “please be very careful with her,” as she passes him. Baca then appears in the doorway holding knives in each hand. He points his pistol at Baca and begins shouting for her to drop the knife. Last month, police released a narrated video containing redacted portions of the 911 call and a very small portion of the body camera video of the officer arriving on the scene. In the 911 call, Baca’s daughter tells the dispatcher: “I really need an officer or an ambulance or someone because my mother is getting really aggressive.” “I’m hiding in a room because she’s threatening to kill me,” she said. She told the dispatcher her mother had dementia. The Las Cruces police officer’s identity has not been made public. He has reportedly been placed on administrative leave. Baca’s family announced Thursday they plan to file civil lawsuits against the city and police department. They have also demanded that the district attorney charge the officer with murder. “Let me be blunt. Amelia Baca was executed by the Las Cruces Police Department,” the family’s attorney, Sam Bregman, told reporters, according to the Las Cruces Sun News. “As a result of this senseless tragedy, the Baca family is respectfully demanding that the district attorney charge this officer with murder.” “You can’t walk up to someone’s front door when they’re having a mental health crisis ... and shoot them after yelling at them for 38 seconds,” Bregman said. Shortly after the news conference, the city said in a statement that it couldn’t comment, the Sun News reported. “First, we do not take critical incidents such as this lightly, especially when there is a loss of life,” the statement said. “We, again, extend our sympathies to the family and friends of Amelia Baca. Any loss of life, no matter the circumstances, is tragic.” A task force of local law enforcement departments are investigating and will send findings to District Attorney Gerald Byers.

6,Why The 'Explosive' COVID-19 Outbreak In North Korea Is So Alarming,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost North Korea declared a “maximum emergency” on Thursday after officials announced the country’s first outbreak of COVID-19, a bleak moment for the reclusive nation as most of its citizens remain unvaccinated against the virus. Just a day later, North Korea said a new fever had spread “explosively” across the nation, infecting at least 350,000 people since April and causing at least six deaths, including one confirmed to be linked to the coronavirus. At least 18,000 people were diagnosed with the fever nationwide on Thursday alone, and more than 187,000 people were being isolated and treated. “A fever whose cause couldn’t be identified explosively spread nationwide from late April, and more than 350,000 people got fever in a short span of time,” North Korea’s state-run KCNA said Friday. The agency added that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed: “It is the most important challenge and supreme tasks facing our Party to reverse the immediate public health crisis situation at an early date, restore the stability of epidemic prevention and protect the health and wellbeing of our people.” The figures echo what many other countries experienced at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. But for North Korea, which has effectively sequestered itself the past two years and maintained an iron grip on its people, the outbreak presents a stark public health challenge and raises deep concern that it could prompt a humanitarian crisis. State media said Thursday that authorities had found the first case of the highly transmissible omicron variant of the coronavirus, a rare admission from Pyongyang. All North Korean cities and counties were ordered into strict lockdown to prevent any spread. NK News reported some experts believe North Korea’s large-scale military parade on April 25 could have been a superspreader event that triggered the current outbreak. Tens of thousands of maskless North Koreans participated in the event, which celebrated the 90th anniversary of the country’s military. Kim himself wore a mask in public on Thursday, the first time he’s believed to have done so. Yonhap News said the decision likely demonstrates the troubling situation North Korea is in with the latest outbreak. The New York Times noted that North Korea has not accepted any COVID-19 vaccine donations from other nations and has a woefully under-prepared public health system. Any strain on its health infrastructure would also be exacerbated by two years of border closures with China, its main trading partner, and fierce United Nations sanctions over its ballistic weapons programs. Joshua Pollack, the editor of the U.S.-based Nonproliferation Review and a close follower of North Korea, said the country’s years-long strategy to keep COVID-19 out only imperiled it when the virus eventually arrived. “North Korea’s weak public health system has pushed them into a corner: to keep COVID out, they have sealed the borders right [up],” he wrote on Twitter. “But this also keeps most food and medical imports out. The public is vulnerable.” For now, North Korea seems to be relying on a lockdown in Pyongyang to handle the outbreak. But it’s almost bound to be more than one case by now. The country can’t be sealed perfectly forever. https://t.co/NuH8KAsc1p South Korean officials have expressed hope that any request for aid from the North could help restart diplomatic talks that have languished for years. Seoul’s Unification Ministry, which focuses on relations between the two nations, said the country would provide medical assistance and other help to the North if requested, The Associated Press reported. The United States said Thursday it had no immediate plans to share vaccines with Pyongyang, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki accusing the Kim regime of focusing more on military power than medical supplies. “We do continue to support international efforts aimed at the provision of critical humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable North Koreans, and this is, of course, a broader part of the DPRK continuing to exploit its own citizens by not accepting this type of aid,” Psaki said Thursday. “It’s not just vaccines. It’s also a range of humanitarian assistance that could very much help the people and the country, and instead they divert resources to build their unlawful nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
7,Brittney Griner's Russian Detention Extended For 1 Month,politics," MOSCOW (AP) — The lawyer for WNBA star Brittney Griner said Friday her pre-trial detention in Russia has been extended by one month. Griner’s lawyer Alexander Boikov told The Associated Press he believed the relatively short extension of the detention indicated the case would come to trial soon. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was detained at the Moscow airport after vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis were allegedly found in her luggage, which could carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. The Biden administration says Griner, 31, is being wrongfully detained. The WNBA and U.S. officials have worked toward her release, without visible progress."
8,Mega Millions Pauses Prize Payments After Announcer's On-Air Snafu,politics," Reporter, HuffPost What a mega mixup!

9,Jimmy Kimmel Has Blunt Warning For Republicans 'Caught On Tape Doing Weird Stuff',politics," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Jimmy Kimmel called out Republicans as they continue to push their war on women’s rights ― while also noting that other nations are moving in the opposite direction. Spain, for example, is now offering three days of paid leave for women who have severe menstrual pain. “Meanwhile, here in the USA, Republican leaders in Washington are writing a bill that says if a woman has her period in the workplace, she is guilty of witchcraft and should be captured in a burlap bag and cast into the sea,” he said. Kimmel also noted that Republicans in the Senate blocked a bill that would protect abortion rights. “You’d think these people would be for the right to privacy considering how many of them keep getting caught on tape doing weird stuff to their cousins,” he pointed out.

10,Senate Democrats Pressure Baby Formula Manufacturers To Push More Product,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON – Senate Democrats are calling out the companies that manufacture baby formula over a shortage of formula on store shelves across the country. “Formula is a critical source of nutrition for newborns and infants, and this supply shortage has put their health and development at risk,” 32 Senate Democrats, led by Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.), said in a letter Friday to the Infant Nutrition Council of America, an industry trade group. “We are calling on you and your member companies to take immediate action and ensure that infant formula manufacturers are making every effort to mitigate this dangerous shortage and get children the nourishment they need,” the Democrats wrote. The letter is not a request for information or any specific action beyond increasing production and distribution. It’s basically a rebuke of the industry amid an escalating political blame game over a formula crisis with no easy solution. Republicans have hammered the White House for not responding more aggressively, and some have questioned the Food and Drug Administration’s decision in February to shutter an Abbott Nutrition factory in Michigan linked to four cases of dangerous Cronobacter sakazakii bacterial infections in infants. Two of the cases were fatal; the company has said there’s “no evidence” its product is to blame even though the FDA found unsanitary conditions at the plant. On Thursday, the administration announced a series of small policy steps aimed at increasing the commercial supply of formula. One measure would allow food vouchers in the Women, Infants and Children program to be used for more than the usual range of formula products. The administration also said the FDA would soon announce steps to import more formula – the U.S. produces about 98% domestically at the moment. But officials couldn’t promise there would be more formula stocked on shelves anytime soon. Officials did emphasize more formula had been produced in the United States in the past month than in the month preceding the recall. Abbott is one of just four firms that make up the Infant Nutrition Council and produce the vast majority of formula in the U.S. Even before the shutdown of Abbott’s Michigan plant in February, formula supplies were strained; some members of Congress have suggested industry consolidation contributed to the supply problem. Murray and Casey first queried Abbott about its facility in February. Casey and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) asked the FDA in April why the agency waited until February to push Abbott to close its plant and recall affected products when the first consumer complaints emerged back in September. The Food and Drug Administration said earlier this week it was working to ramp up production of baby formula. The agency also warned consumers not to make their own formula at home. “Homemade infant formula recipes have not been evaluated by the FDA and may lack nutrients vital to an infant’s growth,” cautioned a statement on the FDA website. “The FDA does not recommend that parents and caregivers make infant formulas at home because of serious health and safety concerns. The potential problems with homemade formulas include contamination and absence of or inadequate amounts of critical nutrients.” However, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) introduced legislation on Thursday that would require the FDA publish guidelines “for safely making formula at home” despite the agency’s warning not to do so. Calling on the FDA to take action is just one example of how lawmakers are responding to the crisis. Other Republicans are choosing to exploit the shortage for political gain by attacking – who else – undocumented immigrants. Specifically, these lawmakers are effectively suggesting the babies should be starved because of their immigration status. “The Biden administration has been sending pallets of baby formula for illegal mothers and their babies while American mothers and babies cannot find baby formula,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said at a Thursday news conference. “This is completely unacceptable, and this needs to end now.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

11,Samuel Alito Addresses Supreme Court Draft Leak For First Time,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Samuel Alito, the Supreme Court justice who authored the leaked draft majority opinion showing the court is preparing to strike down landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights, addressed the leak for the first time Thursday. “This is a subject I told myself I wasn’t going to talk about today regarding, you know — given all the circumstances,” Alito said at an event at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, in response to a question about how the justices were getting along, according to The Washington Post. The nine high court justices met in private Thursday morning for the first time since Politico published Alito’s draft last week. “The court right now, we had our conference this morning, we’re doing our work. We’re taking new cases, we’re headed toward the end of the term, which is always a frenetic time as we get our opinions out,” Alito said. “So that’s where we are,” he continued. Chief Justice John Roberts told a meeting of lawyers and judges at a judicial conference in Atlanta on May 5 that he hoped “one bad apple” would not change “people’s perception” of the Supreme Court, according to CNN. Roberts previously confirmed the authenticity of the leaked document and said he had ordered an investigation. The source of the leak remains unknown. Alito’s draft opinion took issue with decisions upholding abortion rights in Roe and in a later case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. If the court’s ruling, expected in the next two months, hews to the draft, more than 20 states are set to fully ban abortions. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Alito wrote in the draft. “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled … It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

12,National Archives Subpoenaed Over Classified Documents Trump Took To Mar-a-Lago,politics," Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost Federal investigators have subpoenaed the National Archives and Records Administration for classified documents shipped to former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort after he left the White House. The subpoena is part of a grand jury investigation into how those documents were handled, according to The New York Times. The National Archives in February asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Trump violated the law after discovering 15 boxes of records at Mar-a-Lago. Investigators are trying to determine how the documents were shipped to Florida and whether those involved knew about the sensitive content. To answer those questions, they also are seeking to question Trump officials present at the White House in the last days of his presidency. Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich told the Times the presidential records were handled appropriately. “President Trump consistently handled all documents in accordance with applicable law and regulations,” Budowich said. “Belated attempts to second-guess that clear fact are politically motivated and misguided.” In January, the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of presidential records from Mar-a-Lago and found “items marked as classified national security information within the boxes,” according to a letter from the U.S. archivist to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. “If this was anyone but ‘Trump,’ there would be no story here,” Trump wrote in his blog following the discovery. “Instead the Democrats are in search of the next scam.” Trump relentlessly criticized 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton for using personal email for State Department correspondence that included classified subjects. The Presidential Records Act includes a provision “that presidential records automatically transfer into the legal custody of the Archivist as soon as the President leaves office.” Presidential records may include documents, photos and letters. The National Archives reached out to Trump after realizing key documents from his administration hadn’t been turned over, including Trump’s letters to Kim Jong Un, a letter former President Barack Obama left for Trump, and an altered weather map in the 2019 Sharpiegate incident, according to The Washington Post. This is not the first time Trump has come under fire over his handling of records. In 2018, Politico reported staff use clear Scotch tape to piece back together documents Trump had ripped apart. White House staff also thought Trump was behind White House toilets periodically found clogged with ripped papers, according to Maggie Haberman’s upcoming book on Trump, shared by Axios.

A recall by a major formula manufacturer has exacerbated an already stressed supply chain, prompting retailers to limit purchases. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced actions to mitigate the crunch, and outgoing White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration has called on stores to impose restrictions “to prevent the possibility of hoarding.” “We know that is an issue,” Psaki added in the clip Ingraham showed Thursday night.

Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usershttps://t.co/Y2t0QMuuyn It wasn’t immediately clear how the metric affected Musk’s decision to buy the the company. Hours later, Musk added: Still committed to acquisition Musk’s confusing announcement is likely related to financing, Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, said. Musk, who also runs Tesla, used Tesla shares as collateral to secure loans for the Twitter purchase. But Tesla’s share price has been battered along with other tech stocks in recent weeks. “If Tesla stock keeps falling, he may not even have enough shares left to guarantee the loans,” Carusone tweeted Friday. “So, no, I don’t think this about bots. This is about @elonmusk’s ideology getting ahead of his obligations to Tesla shareholders and his erratic behavior tanking Tesla value,” Carusone wrote in a subsequent tweet. 4/ So, no, I don’t think this about bots. This is about @elonmusk’s ideology getting ahead of his obligations to Tesla shareholders and his erratic behavior tanking Tesla value. New York Times tech columnist Kara Swisher characterized Musk’s comments about spam accounts as a pretext to walk away, ducking a $1 billion breakup fee, and then “come back at a lower price.” “Ironically someone like him could really improve Twitter as a private company but he could not resist performative hand waving on all manner of subjects,” Swisher said in a separate tweet. “He should have hushed and just paid the breakup fee, bought more shares on plunge and waited. But chaos it will be!” Ironically someone like him could really improve twitter as a private company but he could not resist performative hand waving on all manner of subjects. He should have hushed and just paid the breakup fee, bought more shares on plunge and waited. But chaos it will be! Musk reached a deal with Twitter’s board last month to buy the social media giant for $44 billion, saying he had secured enough funding to do so. The deal includes a $1 billion termination fee, which Musk would have to pay if he walked away, according to Bloomberg. The company itself is also going through changes ahead of the deal. Periscope co-founder Kayvon Beykpour announced his departure on Thursday, saying Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal asked him to resign. “Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction,” Beykpour tweeted. The truth is that this isn’t how and when I imagined leaving Twitter, and this wasn’t my decision. Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction. Bruce Falck, Twitter’s product lead, also left the company on Thursday. Musk’s announcements follow a series of statements he made this week about the platform, including his intention to restore former President Donald Trump’s account. “I would reverse the permanent ban,” Musk told a Financial Times event on Tuesday. “I don’t own Twitter yet. So this is not like a thing that will definitely happen, because what if I don’t own Twitter?” This article has been updated with Musk saying he’s still committed to the deal.

15,Elon Musk Reveals What He Thinks Of Trump Running In 2024,politics," Reporter, HuffPost Elon Musk wants Donald Trump back on Twitter, but that doesn’t mean he’s in favor of Trump retaking the White House. “Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter,” tweeted the billionaire Tesla CEO, who said Friday he’s pausing his $44 billion purchase of the platform but “remains committed.” Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter Musk suggested on Thursday that President Joe Biden was elected because people wanted a break from the nonstop controversies of the Trump administration. “Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country,” he wrote, adding: “But actually everyone just wanted less drama.” Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama Musk, a self-described champion of “free speech,” has said he’ll take Twitter private on completion of his purchase. Twitter banned Trump in January 2021 for inciting the U.S. Capitol riot. He frequently used the platform to peddle lies, attack enemies and divide the nation. Last week, Musk claimed Trump’s removal from Twitter was a mistake. “I think it was a morally bad decision to be clear and foolish in the extreme,” he said, adding it “alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice.” Trump, though, has said he won’t return to Twitter and instead will focus on using his own struggling Truth Social network. He is yet to officially declare his candidacy for 2024, despite teasing the prospect ever since losing the 2020 vote. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

16,Lindsey Graham Grovels On Fox News Over Leaked Audio Of Him Praising Joe Biden,politics," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Asked on Fox News to explain his recently revealed praise of President Joe Biden on Jan. 6, 2021, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) predictably resorted to criticizing Biden and flattering Donald Trump. On Tuesday, CNN aired audio of Graham speaking to New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin in the hours after the Capitol riot. During the exchange, Graham said the country would eventually move on from the incident and realize “we’re better than this.” He added that Biden would likely be the best person to lead the country forward. “Yeah, totally, he’ll be maybe the best person to have, right? I mean, how mad can you get at Joe Biden?” he said in the recording. Graham was pressed on the comments Thursday during an appearance on “Jesse Watters Primetime.” “Joe Biden. The best person to have? Do you really believe that?” Watters asked him. Graham said “I was wrong.” “I’ve known Joe for 30 years,” he said. “He’s a nice guy, but he’s been a disaster as president.” He added: “This was literally happening on the day of January the 6th and I was hoping that President Biden would bring us together ... But not only has he failed to bring us together, he has made us less safe. He’s ruined our economy. All the bad guys are moving around the world.” He then pivoted to a common Republican refrain, suggesting that Trump projected more strength on the global stage. “They didn’t do this on Trump’s watch because they were afraid of him,” he said. “Nobody fears Joe Biden abroad, and at home his policies are failing.” Watters left the questioning at that, though he swiped at Graham for “speaking to New York Times reporters.” “If I was a senator, I’d never do it,” Watters quipped. Graham called that “very good advice.” Graham’s feelings about the attack have apparently lessened dramatically since the day it happened, when he condemned Trump on the Senate floor, telling colleagues: “All I can say is count me out. Enough is enough.” In the following months, he reverted to sucking up to Trump. By the one-year anniversary of the siege, he was accusing Biden of “brazen politicization” of the attack. The audio was released to promote a new book, “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future,” authored by Martin and fellow Times reporter Alexander Burns.
