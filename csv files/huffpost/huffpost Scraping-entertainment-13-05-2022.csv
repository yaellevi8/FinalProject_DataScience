0,'Bridgerton' Family Member Replaced For Third Season Of Hit Netflix Show,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost What would Lady Whistledown make of it? Ruby Stokes is leaving the hit Netflix show “Bridgerton.” Her character Francesca Bridgerton, who appeared sporadically in the first two seasons, will be replaced in the upcoming third season of the regency period drama by Hannah Dodd, of “Anatomy of a Scandal” fame. Stokes is off to star in Netflix’s upcoming “Lockwood & Co.” series, reported Deadline. The recasting could mean the younger Bridgerton sibling has a more prominent role in future episodes, the outlet suggested. Filming on the third season begins this summer. Reporter, HuffPost"
1,Kanye West Told Kim Kardashian Her 'Career Is Over' For Dressing Like Marge Simpson,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Kim Kardashian’s and Kanye West’s divorce has pulled a smattering of famous types into its orbit (Trevor Noah, Hillary Clinton and, of course Pete Davidson), but never did we expect the former couple to bring Marge Simpson into their mess. On the most recent episode of the famous family’s new Hulu series, “The Kardashians,” the reality TV star expressed anxiety about charting new fashion territory without West, whom she divorced in February 2021 after six years of marriage. The Yeezy founder played an instrumental role in overhauling his former wife’s style ― he demanded that she purge an entire closet of clothes months into their relationship ― and hand-selected nearly every outfit she wore in public until their split. “I got to a point where I would ask his advice for everything down to what I wear,” Kardashian told sister Kourtney on Wednesday’s episode. “Even now I’m having panic attacks, like what do I wear?” Kardashian was left to her own devices for last year’s WSJ. Magazine’s Innovator Awards, where she was honored for her shapewear brand SKIMS. The brown leather dress, which she accessorized with matching gloves and over-the-knee snakeskin boots, however, received less than favorable reviews from West. “He called me afterwards,” Kardashian said. “He told me my career is over and then he showed me a picture of Marge Simpson wearing something similar.” It’s unclear exactly what picture West might’ve been referring to, but viewers quickly came up with a few options on Twitter after the episode aired. Kanye sent Kim a picture of Marge Simpson in a dress similar to what she wore at the Wall Street Journal awards. Who wore it better? #TheKardashians pic.twitter.com/rOnDHZTy0q Ye tells Kim her career was 'over' as he compared her awards dress outfit to a dress worn by The Simpson's character marge. Ye gave her fashion and took it away pic.twitter.com/Ue8ph6o3Jt Simpson, we must note, is a bit of fashion trailblazer in her own right, rocking garments from the luxury fashion house Balenciaga on an animated runway last year. Later on in the episode, Kardashian seemed to find her own footing style-wise, but admitted that she has “never really been the visionary” when it came to fashion. “His love language is clothes,” she said of West. “I always just trusted in him, but it’s not just about clothes. That was, like, the last thing we had really in common.” “I’m trying to figure out, like, who am I in the fashion world? Who am I by myself?” she continued. “I was always, like, The Kardashians with my sisters and then I was, like, Kimye. Like, who is Kim K? That is the jump. How do I get there without Kanye?” If her recent Met Gala ensemble is any indication, Kardashian is doing just fine in the fashion department. She caused all sorts of conversation for slinking into the vintage gown worn by Marilyn Monroe to President John F. Kennedy’s birthday celebration in 1962. Kardashian attended the event alongside boyfriend, “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, who she started dating in the fall after her hosting debut on late-night sketch show. In her new relationship, Kardashian has seemingly assumed West’s role, with Davidson joking on the red carpet that she “didn’t let me wear my propeller hat, but it’s fine.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Jimmy Kimmel Has Blunt Warning For Republicans 'Caught On Tape Doing Weird Stuff',entertainment," Overnight Editor, HuffPost Jimmy Kimmel called out Republicans as they continue to push their war on women’s rights ― while also noting that other nations are moving in the opposite direction. Spain, for example, is now offering three days of paid leave for women who have severe menstrual pain. “Meanwhile, here in the USA, Republican leaders in Washington are writing a bill that says if a woman has her period in the workplace, she is guilty of witchcraft and should be captured in a burlap bag and cast into the sea,” he said. Kimmel also noted that Republicans in the Senate blocked a bill that would protect abortion rights. “You’d think these people would be for the right to privacy considering how many of them keep getting caught on tape doing weird stuff to their cousins,” he pointed out.

3,Seth Meyers Can’t Get Over 1 Part Of The Latest Wild Trump Revelation,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Donald Trump has pretty much lost the power to shock or surprise, “Late Night” host Seth Meyers admitted Thursday. But the comedian said he still “can’t get over the fact” that Trump reportedly asked if the U.S. could bomb drug labs in Mexico without being found out. Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper revealed the former president’s wild idea in his new memoir. “Imagine you’re Mexico. The U.S. just had an election where they chose a visibly insane game show host who said horrible things about Mexicans and suddenly missiles start raining down on you. Would you be mystified?” asked Meyers. Watch Meyers’ full monologue here: Reporter, HuffPost"
4,Lindsey Graham Grovels On Fox News Over Leaked Audio Of Him Praising Joe Biden,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Asked on Fox News to explain his recently revealed praise of President Joe Biden on Jan. 6, 2021, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) predictably resorted to criticizing Biden and flattering Donald Trump. On Tuesday, CNN aired audio of Graham speaking to New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin in the hours after the Capitol riot. During the exchange, Graham said the country would eventually move on from the incident and realize “we’re better than this.” He added that Biden would likely be the best person to lead the country forward. “Yeah, totally, he’ll be maybe the best person to have, right? I mean, how mad can you get at Joe Biden?” he said in the recording. Graham was pressed on the comments Thursday during an appearance on “Jesse Watters Primetime.” “Joe Biden. The best person to have? Do you really believe that?” Watters asked him. Graham said “I was wrong.” “I’ve known Joe for 30 years,” he said. “He’s a nice guy, but he’s been a disaster as president.” He added: “This was literally happening on the day of January the 6th and I was hoping that President Biden would bring us together ... But not only has he failed to bring us together, he has made us less safe. He’s ruined our economy. All the bad guys are moving around the world.” He then pivoted to a common Republican refrain, suggesting that Trump projected more strength on the global stage. “They didn’t do this on Trump’s watch because they were afraid of him,” he said. “Nobody fears Joe Biden abroad, and at home his policies are failing.” Watters left the questioning at that, though he swiped at Graham for “speaking to New York Times reporters.” “If I was a senator, I’d never do it,” Watters quipped. Graham called that “very good advice.” Graham’s feelings about the attack have apparently lessened dramatically since the day it happened, when he condemned Trump on the Senate floor, telling colleagues: “All I can say is count me out. Enough is enough.” In the following months, he reverted to sucking up to Trump. By the one-year anniversary of the siege, he was accusing Biden of “brazen politicization” of the attack. The audio was released to promote a new book, “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future,” authored by Martin and fellow Times reporter Alexander Burns.

5,GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn Receives A Brutal Reminder After Veterans Tweet,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Far-right Rep. Madison Cawthorn’s tweet evoking veterans backfired. The North Carolina Republican appeared to criticize House approval of $40 billion in aid for Ukraine with this post on Wednesday: Imagine if we spent $40 Billion on veterans. In response, he received a series of searing reminders of his own votes against bills that assist former U.S. military service members. “DON’T EVEN pretend you care about Veterans,” responded VoteVets, a progressive PAC promoting Democratic military veterans for Congress. Other critics remembered Cawthorn’s misleading campaign ads that sought to spin his rejection by the U.S. Naval Academy. In March, Cawthorn voted against a bill to provide $20 billion per year to veterans exposed to toxins during their service https://t.co/ySn2OTuhJl Fact #1: The U.S. spends hundreds of billions of dollars a year on the VA.Fact #2: Cawthorn is a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and he really ought to be aware of Fact #1. https://t.co/RJpxEJ8E7c Imagine if @RepCawthorn, @GOPLeader McCarthy and 172 other House Republicans hadn't voted against the #HonoringOurPACT Act earlier this year. But no, House Republicans don't think health care for veterans sick & dying from burn pit exposure is worth it. https://t.co/Tq8Vgjvs0L https://t.co/ebJ6S7EWou Imagine if we had a Congressman who, being a member of the VA committee, didn't vote no for helping veterans with their debts simply because the book had too many pages to read. https://t.co/P1PLkYLE5W We currently spend $340 billion a year on veterans, you ignorant jackass.You also vote against veterans' benefits every chance you get, so kindly fuck off and stop using our service members as political pawns. https://t.co/95EGIrJMaV pic.twitter.com/KcSL5VbNsl You vote against Veterans EVERY CHANCE YOU GET.

6,Laura Ingraham Asks Why There Was No Hoarding Under Trump. Twitter Explodes.,entertainment," General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost Laura Ingraham asked with a straight face on Thursday why there was no hoarding under former President Donald Trump, prompting outraged people on Twitter to jog the Fox News host’s memory. (Watch the video below.) Ingraham used the current baby formula shortage to assert her blatant falsehood. A recall by a major formula manufacturer has exacerbated an already stressed supply chain, prompting retailers to limit purchases. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced actions to mitigate the crunch, and outgoing White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration has called on stores to impose restrictions “to prevent the possibility of hoarding.” “We know that is an issue,” Psaki added in the clip Ingraham showed Thursday night. Ingraham then asked with a smug cackle: “Why didn’t we have hoarding during the Trump administration?” Her guests, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and conservative author Horace Cooper, heartily agreed. Ingraham: Why didn’t we have hoarding during the Trump administration? pic.twitter.com/UTcXyWw2vn Let us take you back in time, Laura, to the beginning of the pandemic, 2020. Under Trump. We’ll let Twitter take it from here: What? She doesn’t remember the folks hoarding hand sanitizer and toilet paper? What f**king planet were these people living on? People were physically fighting each other for toilet paper! Hi @IngrahamAngle - we did have hoarding, you nincompoop. Toilet paper, hand sanitizer, MASKS, meat etc. Are you a dementia victim and can’t remember back to summer 2020?????? 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ https://t.co/fbUGcOS2Ms @IngrahamAngIe must forget the great toilet paper shortage of 2020.

7,Elon Musk Reveals What He Thinks Of Trump Running In 2024,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Elon Musk wants Donald Trump back on Twitter, but that doesn’t mean he’s in favor of Trump retaking the White House. “Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter,” tweeted the billionaire Tesla CEO, who said Friday he’s pausing his $44 billion purchase of the platform but “remains committed.” Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter Musk suggested on Thursday that President Joe Biden was elected because people wanted a break from the nonstop controversies of the Trump administration. “Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country,” he wrote, adding: “But actually everyone just wanted less drama.” Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama Musk, a self-described champion of “free speech,” has said he’ll take Twitter private on completion of his purchase. Twitter banned Trump in January 2021 for inciting the U.S. Capitol riot. He frequently used the platform to peddle lies, attack enemies and divide the nation. Last week, Musk claimed Trump’s removal from Twitter was a mistake. “I think it was a morally bad decision to be clear and foolish in the extreme,” he said, adding it “alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice.” Trump, though, has said he won’t return to Twitter and instead will focus on using his own struggling Truth Social network. He is yet to officially declare his candidacy for 2024, despite teasing the prospect ever since losing the 2020 vote. Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

8,Jail Time? Ex-Prosecutor Names The Law Kevin McCarthy Should Be Worried About.,entertainment," Overnight Editor, HuffPost A former federal prosecutor says House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and several other GOP lawmakers may have committed a very specific crime in their possible attempts to cover up Donald Trump’s Jan. 6 plot to overturn his election defeat. “It’s called misprision of a felony,” Glenn Kirschner, who spent 24 years as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, explained on his YouTube channel. The law says someone who has knowledge of a felony that’s “cognizable by a court of the United States” but doesn’t come forward with information about it could face up to three years in prison. Kirshner noted that a federal judge in March determined it “more likely than not” that Trump “corruptly attempted to obstruct” the Jan. 6 vote certification by Congress. That makes potential Jan. 6-related crimes “cognizable by a court” ― and significant now that McCarthy and four other GOP lawmakers linked to Trump have been subpoenaed by the House Jan. 6 committee to answer questions about their knowledge and involvement. If they refuse to comply, Kirshner said, it “looks like misprision of a felony to me.” He added: “Also looks like accessory after the fact. Also looks like they are criminal co-conspirators with Donald Trump in his conspiracy to defraud or commit crimes against the United States.” “So many crimes to choose from,” he concluded.

9,Video Shows Police Fatally Shoot Grandmother With Dementia In New Mexico Home,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Police in New Mexico have released disturbing body camera footage showing an officer fatally shooting a 75-year-old woman with dementia in her home last month. Warning to readers: The video, below, is graphic and disturbing. The woman, Amelia Baca, had become agitated at family members in the Las Cruces home when her daughter called the police for help on April 16. According to family members, Baca was having a mental health crisis. In body camera video released Tuesday by the city of Las Cruces in response to a public records request, an officer can be seen pointing a gun at Baca through the doorway of the home moments after arriving on the scene. Baca, who family members said did not speak English, is holding two kitchen knives and shouting in Spanish. The officer repeatedly shouts at her in English to “drop the knife,” “drop the fucking knife,” “do it now.” After 38 seconds, he tells her to “put the fucking knife down” and fires two shots at her. She died at the scene. The video is below. It is graphic. The body camera footage begins with the officer arriving at the house. As he approaches the front door, he asks two women — Baca’s daughter and grandmother — to step outside. The granddaughter, Albitar Inoh, tells the officer, “please be very careful with her,” as she passes him. Baca then appears in the doorway holding knives in each hand. He points his pistol at Baca and begins shouting for her to drop the knife. Last month, police released a narrated video containing redacted portions of the 911 call and a very small portion of the body camera video of the officer arriving on the scene. In the 911 call, Baca’s daughter tells the dispatcher: “I really need an officer or an ambulance or someone because my mother is getting really aggressive.” “I’m hiding in a room because she’s threatening to kill me,” she said. She told the dispatcher her mother had dementia. The Las Cruces police officer’s identity has not been made public. He has reportedly been placed on administrative leave. Baca’s family announced Thursday they plan to file civil lawsuits against the city and police department. They have also demanded that the district attorney charge the officer with murder. “Let me be blunt. Amelia Baca was executed by the Las Cruces Police Department,” the family’s attorney, Sam Bregman, told reporters, according to the Las Cruces Sun News. “As a result of this senseless tragedy, the Baca family is respectfully demanding that the district attorney charge this officer with murder.” “You can’t walk up to someone’s front door when they’re having a mental health crisis ... and shoot them after yelling at them for 38 seconds,” Bregman said. Shortly after the news conference, the city said in a statement that it couldn’t comment, the Sun News reported. “First, we do not take critical incidents such as this lightly, especially when there is a loss of life,” the statement said. “We, again, extend our sympathies to the family and friends of Amelia Baca. Any loss of life, no matter the circumstances, is tragic.” A task force of local law enforcement departments are investigating and will send findings to District Attorney Gerald Byers.

10,Norm Macdonald Shot A Secret Stand-Up Special Before His Death,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Turns out the late comedian Norm Macdonald has one more show to deliver. The “Saturday Night Live” alum filmed a final stand-up special before his death in September, “Norm Macdonald: Nothing Special,” which Netflix has revealed will debut on the streaming platform on May 30. The comedy great was diagnosed with cancer nearly a decade ago, but kept his condition private. He was 61 when he died on Sept. 14, 2021. According to his friend and longtime producer, Lori Jo Hoekstra, Macdonald was working on the material in mid-2020. “His test results were not good, so during the heart of [the] COVID-19 pandemic and literally the night before going in for a procedure, he wanted to get this on tape just in case — as he put it — things went south,” Hoekstra told The Hollywood Reporter. “It was his intention to have a special to share if something happened.” The special was shot in Macdonald’s living room in a single take. As it happened, Macdonald made it through another year. But before he could film the show before an audience, he became ill in August 2021 and died the following month. Macdonald rose to prominence as a cast member on “Saturday Night Live” in the 1990s. He was best known for his impressions of Quentin Tarantino, David Letterman, Larry King, Bob Dole and Burt Reynolds, among many others. He also starred in his own comedy series, “The Norm Show,” appeared on multiple late-night shows and voice-acted in films. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
11,Chaney Jones Gets Boyfriend Kanye West's Name Tattooed On Wrist,entertainment,"  Kanye West’s girlfriend made it a love lockdown and sported a tattoo of the rapper’s name Thursday. Chaney Jones, who revealed the tattoo through Instagram Stories, showed off her boyfriend’s signature inked on her wrist. She wore the body art along with an all-silver look fresh with a pair of inverted heels. Jones reportedly started dating the “Donda” rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, in February. The black ink on her wrist appeared to depict the rapper’s recent name change. Aside from supporting her boyfriend, Jones is the chief operating officer of First State Behavioral Health, a Delaware-based counseling center. Jones’ tattoo reveal comes roughly two months after West’s ex-wife Kim Kardashian announced her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, had “branded” her name on his body. Fans initially spotted the Kim K branding in a picture from a leaked text exchange between Davidson and West. Davidson also recently added a “KNSCP” tattoo to his body art arsenal, an apparent tribute to the names of Kardashian’s children, BuzzFeed reported earlier this month. The “Saturday Night Live” comedian has a history of getting tattoos in his girlfriend’s honor, including for exes Ariana Grande and Cazzie David, according to the site. "
12,Amanda Seyfried Was 'Grossed Out' By Men's Reactions To Famous 'Mean Girls' Scene,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost In “Mean Girls,” Amanda Seyfried delivered one of the most stealthily sweet and undeniably hilarious performances of the early aughts, earning her plenty of praise, industry credibility and, she’s now revealing, the “gross” attention of men everywhere. The actor is enshrined in pop culture history for starring in the high school comedy as the lovably clueless Karen Smith, who believes she has a special “ESPN” power to predict the weather with her breasts. In one of the film’s most famous moments, Seyfried’s character delivers an on-air weather report, while fondling herself to boldly proclaim, “There’s a 30% chance that it’s already raining.” Speaking with Marie Claire for a new profile published on Tuesday, Seyfried revealed the unfortunate consequence of the oft-quoted scene. “I always felt really grossed out by that,” she told the outlet, noting that she was consistently approached by “mostly boys” who asked her if it was raining. “I was like 18 years old. It was just gross.” Seyfried went on to explain that she’s made choices to avoid the spotlight in her post-“Mean Girls” career, remarking, “Being really famous [young] must really fucking suck.” “It must make you feel completely unsafe in the world,” she added. “I see these younger actors who think they have to have security. They think they have to have an assistant. They think their whole world has changed. It can get stressful. I’ve seen it happen to my peers. So, I bought a farm. I was like, let’s go in the opposite way.” Seyfried now lives on a 30-acre farm in upstate New York with her husband, actor Thomas Sadoski, and their two children. Despite her recent turn as Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes in Hulu’s “The Dropout” and her Oscar-nominated performance in Netflix’s “Mank,” Seyfried said she has enjoyed the perks of being “somewhat recognizable,” but never “super famous.” “It’s been the healthiest trajectory. [It’s] not a scary spike,” she said. “I have my priorities. I know who I am. I know where I’m going. I know what it means. It means that I’m getting to do what I love.” “Mean Girls” was Seyfried’s first-ever film role, as she had only worked on television, primarily in soap operas, before her breakout turn in the Tina Fey-directed film. “Just hitting my mark, and all these other bells and whistles that I had never seen before, it just felt really daunting and exciting,” she said about landing the part in Variety’s “Actors on Actors” series. “I never had any expectations of anything. I was just glad to be working as an actor, getting paid to speak actual dialogue — as opposed to being in the background.” Last year, Seyfried shared a fond memory from the film, posting a throwback snap of the cast behind the scenes, which she captioned, “#FBF weekends in 2003, baby.” The photo served as a virtual “Mean Girls” reunion, with various cast members dropping by the comments. “Such a fun time! A great team!” Lindsay Lohan wrote, with Lacey Chabert adding in a separate message, “Ohhh emmm geeee. Wow. So many good memories.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
13,Rob Reiner Confirms Sequel To 'This Is Spinal Tap' Is In The Works,entertainment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost After nearly 40 years, the classic 1984 movie “This Is Spinal Tap” is getting a sequel. Dateline is reporting that the spoof heavy-metal band created by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer will be making a comeback in a sequel to the mockumentary called “Spinal Tap II.” Sadly, it looks like the number in the title is meant to be a “2,” and not the number “11,” which looms large in the band’s legend, as you can see from this clip from the first movie. Rob Reiner will direct the movie as well as reprise his role as doofus documentarian Marty DiBergi. He told Deadline that he was constantly asked about whether there would ever be a sequel to the film but said that he and his collaborators came up with the right approach only recently. “You don’t want to just do it to do it. You want to honor the first one and push it a little further with the story,” he said. Reiner noted that Guest, McKean and Shearer have performed as Spinal Tap all over the world but “haven’t spent any time together recently, and that became the premise.” He said the plot will center on the death of longtime manager Ian Faith, played in the film by Tony Hendra. “Ian’s widow inherited a contract that said Spinal Tap owed them one more concert. She was basically going to sue them if they didn’t,” Reiner explained. “All these years and a lot of bad blood we’ll get into, and they’re thrown back together and forced to deal with each other and play this concert.” Reiner said there might be some cameos from famous musicians in the film and added that band might also do a book dedicated to the experiences of real-life rockers that parallel the incidents in the movie. “Like in the movie, they get stoned and can’t find the stage, that happened to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,” Reiner said. The new film will be released March 19, 2024, or 40 years and 17 days after the original’s world premiere. Of course, Twitter users had thoughts.

14,Ashley Judd Opens Up About Mom Naomi Judd’s Death: 'I Have Both Grief And Trauma',entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost A grief-stricken Ashley Judd is speaking out about her mother Naomi Judd’s death so that her family can share information on their own terms. The country music superstar — who was part of the Grammy-winning duo The Judds with her daughter Wynonna Judd — died in April, just days before being inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. She was 76. Ashley Judd told Diane Sawyer on “Good Morning America” Thursday that her stepfather and Wynonna Judd had “deputized” her to speak on the behalf of the family “before things about the 30th of April become public without our control.” “I’m tasked with an exceedingly difficult task in disclosing the manner of the way my mother chose not to continue to live,” she said. Ashley Judd confirmed that her mother died by suicide. “That’s the piece of information we are very uncomfortable sharing,” she said. “But understand that we’re in a position that if we don’t say it, someone else is going to.” She indicated that she was being mindful about what information she chose to make public. “I want to be very careful about when we talk about this today for anyone who is having those ideas or those impulses, to talk to someone, to share, to be open, to be vulnerable,” she said. Ashley Judd told Sawyer that her mother — who revealed she had depression in 2016 — “knew that she was seen and she was heard in her anguish.” “When we’re talking about mental illness, it’s very important to be clear and make the distinction between our loved one and the disease,” she said. “It’s very real … it lies, it’s savage.” Ashley Judd also shared that she was with her mother on the day she died and was the one who “discovered her.” “I have both grief and trauma,” she said. The Emmy-nominated actor also shared sweet details about the type of person her mother was, including how she got to know the staff at her local Cheesecake Factory. “I know everything about them because she told me everything about them,” Ashley Judd recalled. “Or [she’d tell me about] Dwanye at Walgreens who needs to get a dog, that’s the way she was. She always had hundred dollar bills stuffed in her bra and she was passing them out to the janitorial staff. You know, just an unfailingly kind, sensitive woman.” She called her mother a “brilliant conversationalist” and “an underrated songwriter.” Ashley Judd also shared a letter written by Wynonna Judd, who wrote that she needed time to herself in order “to process” her loss.

15,Comedian Andy Dick Arrested On Sexual Battery Allegations,entertainment," Reporter, HuffPost Law enforcement in California arrested Andy Dick on Wednesday after he was accused of sexual battery ― the latest incident involving the comedian in a long list of controversies. The Orange County Sheriff’s Department took Dick into custody after responding to a Wednesday-morning report from a man who alleged the comedian sexually assaulted him, law enforcement told both TMZ and Rolling Stone. The arrest appeared to be livestreamed on a YouTube account that broadcasts from the RV campground where Dick was allegedly living, according to TMZ. (See the video above.) The man’s name has not been released, and officers booked Dick into Orange County jail on felony sexual battery charges. He is currently in custody on $25,000 bond and will next appear in court on Friday, according to the sheriff department’s website. The department did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for a copy of the police report and charging information related to Dick’s arrest. Last month, officers made a welfare check at a home where Dick was staying in Las Vegas after a man who was also there allegedly pulled out a gun during an argument on a livestream, TMZ had reported. The actor reportedly told authorities that he was fine and wanted to stay. Dick, who appeared on the 1990s sitcom “NewsRadio,” has been charged with sexual battery before. In June 2018, the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office filed misdemeanor charges of sexual battery and simple battery after a woman said he grabbed her buttocks twice and made lewd comments as he walked by her. In October 2017, Dick was fired from a film after he was accused of groping, nonconsensually kissing and licking co-workers.
