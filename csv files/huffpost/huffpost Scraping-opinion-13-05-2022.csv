1,"Don’t Be Stingy, President Biden. Forgive As Much Student Loan Debt As Possible.",opinion," After months of being pressured by members of his own party, President Joe Biden recently revealed that he is “taking a hard look” into forgiving some federal student loan debt ― only perhaps not nearly as much as some have called for. “I am considering dealing with some debt reduction,” Biden told reporters at the White House. “I am not considering $50,000 debt reduction. But I’m in the process of taking a hard look at whether or not there will be additional debt forgiveness.” As for how long that “hard look” will take in terms of his decision making, Biden said he would have an answer on forgiving additional debt in the “next couple of weeks.” The remarks came days after separate reports surfaced that Biden expressed a similar sentiment during a meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.), who attended the meeting, explained that Biden never mentioned a specific amount he was looking to cancel, but noted the president claimed, “You’re going to like what I do.” That remains to be seen, but as someone that has suffered greatly under the weight of federal and private student loan debt since graduating from college, I hope Biden not only uses this time to give it real consideration, but to not allow stinginess to be his guiding light should he proceed with cancellation plans. Of course, Biden never made student loan debt a central theme of his campaign the way Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) did in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, but their policy proposals to eliminate either all or significant portions of student loan debt prompted then-candidate Biden to pledge to forgive $10,000 in student loan debt for every borrower. Thus far as president, Biden has implemented various rounds of targeted student loan forgiveness to a small group of borrowers that has eliminated about $16 billion in federal student loans. Yes, that’s more than any previous president, but when 45 million Americans carry a total of $1.7 trillion in student loan debt, forgiving less than 1% rightly feels like a paltry sum. After all, student loan debt is the second-largest debt held by Americans, behind mortgages. Biden has repeatedly extended a freeze on student loan payments and that has helped roughly 41 million borrowers save $5 billion in interest payments a month per the Education Department. That pandemic-era pause on federal student loan payments will last through August 31, but since 2021, the administration has said it was studying the legality of Biden’s ability to cancel debt through executive action, yet has repeatedly failed to release the long awaited memo. It’s one of many reasons why I, like others who care deeply about student loan debt and its impact on millions of Americans, have wondered if the Biden administration was planning to string borrowers along. It’s nice to know that Biden will finally be giving Americans an answer in due time, but it’s been frustrating watching this administration take such a blasé attitude towards the sort of issue that would rally the kind of voters Biden needs most to show up in both the midterms and his looming reelection bid. In a recent Harvard University poll, 85% of a total of 2,024 18-to-29-year-olds surveyed said they favor some form of government action on student loan debt. A separate national tracking poll from Morning Consult and Politico shows how approximately 64% of the 2,000 registered voters collectively support at least some amount of student loan forgiveness. An Economist and YouGov poll from January found that nearly half of all Americans and 70% of Democrats support forgiving student loan debt from public colleges and universities while another poll from Student Borrower Protection Center and Data for Progress found that 75% of Black likely voters and 80% of Latino likely voters support government canceling some-to-all student debt. It’s already a popular issue, so if President Biden offered a coherent message on the importance of debt forgiveness and sold it as a means to lift millions of Americans out of needless struggle, I believe he could only increase the popularity of debt cancellation and benefit politically. Besides, with respect to the Democratic base, Biden owes Black voters more than he’s offered thus far and this is one way to make a more meaningful impact in a tangible way. According to a 2020 NAACP report, among 2016 graduates, almost 40% of Black students left college with $30,000 or more in debt, compared with 29% of white students, 23% of Hispanic students and 18% of Asian students. And according to a 2016 Brookings report, the average Black graduate owes $52,726 four years after graduation compared with $28,006 for the average white graduate. A 2019 study found that $50,000 of federal student loan cancellation would eliminate all student debt for 93% of Black low-income households. Black women in particular are disproportionately impacted by student loan debt, and although the freeze in payments has helped ease some of that burden, cancellation would make an even greater impact. As Warren recently explained in a New York Times op-ed, debt cancellation “would help the millions of female borrowers who shoulder about two-thirds of all student loan debt, and for Black and Hispanic borrowers, a higher percentage of whom take on debt to attend college compared to white students, and have a harder time paying it off after school.” Not only would this be the right thing for Biden to do on principle, it could also help him begin to atone for his own role in the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act ― a law that made it impossible to declare bankruptcy on certain types of credit card debt and all student loan debt. Biden defended his role in the bill during the primary debate, but I align with Sanders’ assessment of the bill that it “was a very, very bad bill.” And as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) previously said, “It’s outrageous that other people get to declare bankruptcy but students can’t.” Though not everyone may align with the viewpoints of these Democratic senators, their arguments against student loan debt still fail to impress. Sen. Mitt Romney has suggested “desperate polls call for desperate measures” as the reason for Biden wanting to forgive student loan debt and claimed the move would constitute a “bribe.” “Other bribe suggestions: Forgive auto loans? Forgive credit card debt? Forgive mortgages? And put a wealth tax on the super-rich to pay for it all,” he tweeted. Romney forgot to include medical debt, but this sort of argument is to be expected from someone born into privilege and earned from profit via work in private equity. The same can be said for Fox News’ Laura Ingraham who also argued in a tweet against student loan forgiveness because her mom had to work into her 70s to pay for her to attend college. “My mom worked as a waitress until she was 73 to help pay for our college, even helped with loan repayment. Loan forgiveness is just another insult to those who play by the rules.” Ingraham is a famous racist whose own brother has condemned her. The “rules” are made for despicable people like her to benefit. And unshocking as it is that she believes everyone should suffer like her mama allegedly did, no one should mirror that type of selfishness. Biden needs to ignore conservatives and rich people from his own party, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), on student loan debt cancellation and think of the people suffering. For many struggling with student loan debt, it not only impacts their ability to buy a home, start a business, move for a new job opportunity or start a family, it also contributes to their mental health and behavior. In a new study released in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, researchers say student loan debt can impact heart health. I wrote an entire book on how my student loan debt impacted every facet of my life. How at my lowest points, suicide was never the option as some feared for me because I was too aware of the reality that my mom would still be on the hook for my private loan debt as a co-signer. I don’t share the selfish attitude that because I had to suffer, everyone else should. I have not benefited from the pause in federal student loan payments. I will not qualify for any of Biden’s potential cancellation options. I want student loan debt forgiveness all the same because I would never wish that misery on anyone else. In a new analysis, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated that canceling $50,0000 in student loan debt would forgive the full balance for almost 30 million federal student loan borrowers, with an average forgiveness of more than $23,800 per borrower ― at a cost of $904 billion. For comparison, U.S. military spending amounted to $801 billion in 2021. So as Biden weighs his options on debt cancellation, if all else fails, perhaps he can be convinced to look at student loan debt cancellation as a war he can win with a shift in priorities and the stroke of a pen.

2,The Sadness of Kevin Samuels' Life and Death,opinion," Opinion Editor Kevin Samuels came to us the way that most viruses do; without warning. One day you’re fine, and the next morning, you’re completely engulfed by it and have no choice but to ride it out. For those of you who are inoculated, just know that Samuels was a self-proclaimed relationship guru who started his own YouTube channel in 2014. He hosted a call-in show in which he offered advice, but the advice was often harsh criticism of the caller’s appearance, or worse. He went viral in 2020 when a female caller told him she was no longer interested in dating below her pay grade. She said she was a business owner and noted that men who weren’t earning at her level or above tended to want to get into her business (both figuratively and literally). Samuels’ advice to the woman was that her desire to attract a man above her social status was a pipe dream, or, as he put it: “Men who make six figures don’t want mid-30s baby mamas.” He also noted that average-looking women (the caller had rated herself a five on a scale of 1–10) didn’t tend to attract high-earning men. Samuels exclaimed that he was giving her a dose of reality. As the caller tried to explain her position, Samuels interrupted her to note: “You can call it what you want to, but women like you die alone. Straight up. Because you think you are better than the men you qualify for.” He also told the woman, who had a baby but had never married the child’s father, that she was a used vehicle wanting brand-new 2021 prices. On Thursday, rumors began swirling that the 57-year-old Samuels had died. For almost a day, no reputable news source would post news of his death. The New York Times waited until Saturday before writing up a story that the social media celebrity and former stylist, “who built his following on an image of plain-spoken, hyper masculine authority, usually wearing a finely tailored suit,” had died. All of it added to the sadness of Kevin Samuels’ life. There is no shortage of men who believe, much like Samuels, that single Black women over 35, are, as Samuels called them, “leftovers.” You can walk into any place where time stands still — a barbershop, boxing gym, Republican convention, or the home of a Howard Stern listener — and find men with beliefs much like Samuels’. There was nothing shiny about Samuels’ archaic thoughts, nothing new to see, nothing prophetic or profound. Yet, there are men — many of whom will now be forced to listen to Joe Budden and DJ Akademiks — who believe, like Samuels, that derogatory, hurtful, spiteful and hate-filled criticism dressed up as “straight talk” is keeping it real. Samuels prided himself in taking Black women and some Black men to task. He was brash and brutal, even when the conversation didn’t call for it. Once, a man called in to his show and noted that he was a phlebotomist. Samuels grew bored with the caller and told him, “Get the fuck off my phone bitch. Go take blood, boy.” He told a single mom that she was being stingy with sex with her “high-value man” after she’d already given up her womb before she’d gotten a ring. And I’m paraphrasing. I must note that I didn’t know Kevin Samuels the person, and there have been several YouTube videos eulogizing him now that he is gone, but I have trouble believing that the highly stylized Samuels, whose soundbites often made it to such studious academic sites such as WorldStar and Media Take Out, was the true man. I want to believe that Samuels is a creation whose origin story starts with a kind fellow who, much like many men before him, was hurt by someone and became the villain. Isn’t this every villain’s origin story? Think about this: He was always immaculately dressed, yet most of his YouTube footage appears to be shot in a room in his home. This means that he would put on a full suit and tie to sit in a room in his home to talk to viewers. For Samuels, the suit was a lot like the Joker’s makeup. Most of his callers were just regular folks, wearing regular clothes, but Samuels would chide them and take them to task while suited and booted. It’s a lot easier to look down on people when you’re dressed to the nines. The suit added to Samuels’ asshole persona. It didn’t make him an asshole any more than big church hats make church women gossip, but it aids in the process, like a cloak or a dagger. Add up all the things that make a knuckle-dragging, barbaric, hypermasculine man, and you would have Kevin Samuels. And much like villains before him, there is no love for the destruction he caused and no redeeming qualities in his death. He picked up his mantle and used it to beat people over the head under the guise of therapy. He was a corner store preacher without a good word, or a basketball dad filled with hate and no kid to cheer on. He was whatever happens to the unloved. He was an abandoned dog commercial — you know, the one that almost makes you cry — he was that one. I never thought Samuels’ commentary was worth noting, but I did think two things the last time I saw one of his viral clips. The first was: He was the walking meme of “Tell me you hate Black women without saying you hate Black women,” except he was actually saying it! And, “Who hurt you?” You don’t just naturally have that much hate in your heart; you aren’t born with that kind of hate. That hate is cultivated over time. It takes run-ins with the law in which you are not a fault and countless rejections. You have to season that kind of hate and set it in the fridge for 48 hours so that it really seeps in. It takes a special kind of hate to tell a woman that she’s the size of Emmitt Smith or Barry Sanders. “You’re a running back’s size. Don’t come in here talking about what men got to accept when they talking to somebody who can run out the power I.” Before the woman could interject, Samuels punctuated his football analogy by yelling, “Hut. Hut.” But the most perplexing, head-scratching aspect of Samuels’ infamy has to be his audience. Not that he has followers — people have always loved polarizing figures; just look at Donald Trump — but why did Black women and men keep calling this suited man who was presumably hosting a YouTube show from his house, looking for advice while knowing that they were opening themselves up to a complete bashing? I’m not kink-shaming, but that’s a different kind of masochism that I’m not familiar with. So a Black man spouting shameful statements has died, and most Black women don’t care. Nor should they. Samuels found an open surfboard in the bash-Black-women ocean and rode the wave. His misogynist talking points and his fatphobic, ageist, caveman-esque sound bites were oppressive, simplistic and unabashedly cruel, and his death doesn’t make him a martyr or noble. It doesn’t erase the damage he’s done. It doesn’t un-scorch the Earth he’s inflamed. That hasn’t stopped some Black men from immortalizing his teachings. But those men are mulish and still believe that Dr. Umar is going to open a school. So that’s on them. When I was a boy, I used to be afraid of villains. And then I got older and realized that all of it, all of the hate-filled monologues, all of the insults, destruction and scarring could be attributed to a deficiency in one vitamin all of us need: love. And how sad is that?! Opinion Editor"
3,"Opinion: The Threat To Our Communities Comes From Anti-Abortion Laws, Not Abortion",opinion," “I heard you flew here from Texas?” I say to my patient as I enter the room. “I’m so sorry you had to come this far.” We are in an abortion clinic in New York City, a long way from her home. As I sit down next to her, her eyes fill up with tears and she begins to tell me how she couldn’t get an appointment in Texas. The demand is so high that they could only offer her an appointment three weeks out, she explained, and she knew by then it would be too late. The famous Supreme Court case legalizing abortion in 1973, Roe v. Wade, made abortion legal up to “viability,” a nebulous concept that varies but is commonly defined as 24 weeks. In 2021, Texas enacted a new anti-abortion law (called “SB8”) that made abortion illegal past about six weeks — a time when most people don’t even realize they’re pregnant. Although this law is still being fought in federal courts, it has remained in effect for over eight months, which has directly impacted pregnant people that need to exercise their rights in a timely fashion. Every week, I am seeing more people from Texas with the same barriers to care. The Supreme Court draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that was leaked earlier this week reveals that Roe v. Wade, and all subsequent cases reaffirming the right to abortion, will likely be overturned this summer. It’s important to know that abortion is still legal in all 50 states. If you have an appointment, don’t be afraid to go in and get the care you need. The leaked document is just a draft, and we can’t be sure what the final decision will be, but we are bracing for the worst. Let’s be clear. Pregnancy is a deeply personal decision that should be left to individuals and their families. The criminalization of abortion will cause scrutiny of all pregnant people, and puts all of our communities at risk. The anti-abortion movement is a modern phenomenon that is rooted in racism and does not have a basis in our legal or religious traditions. The real issues we need to tackle are improving prenatal health care, including abortion care, and reducing racial and socioeconomic disparities. But we are not going back to 1973. The threat to our communities comes from anti-abortion laws themselves, not abortion. Back in my office, my patient’s ultrasound shows that she’s nine weeks pregnant. She expected this after all the delays caused by coordinating travel across the country. She tells me that she is staying at a hotel a few blocks away and the empty hotel room will be good for her. She has a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old at home, and they can make it hard to study. Dad is watching the kids and her grad school finals are coming up, so after the procedure today she’ll be able to focus on studying before her flight back tomorrow. Flying to New York City for abortion care may seem unreasonable — and for most people, this is inaccessible due to cost of taking time off work, finding child care, and paying for travel — but people who can fly to New York are able to access health care without the medically unnecessary array of laws aimed at limiting abortion access in many states. These types of laws are commonly referred to as TRAP laws (targeted regulation of abortion providers). For example, many states require people to look at the ultrasound and wait 24 hours or more for a second appointment that is not medically necessary and only further increases the cost to the patient, causing them to spend more time away from home, work and family. Some states mandate that doctors give pregnant people medically inaccurate information about abortion by reading scripts written by the state filled with fear-mongering lies that abortion causes breast cancer (it does not) or that it may impact future fertility (it does not). Is there any other medical care where the law requires that doctors knowingly lie to their patients? I am a family medicine doctor by training and I practice full-spectrum primary care in my clinic, with my patients ranging from tiny newborns to centennials. My practice has a focus on reproductive health, gender-affirming care and trauma-informed care, and most of my patients are reproductive-age people. In this position, I do cervical cancer screening and treatment. I place and remove long-acting contraception like intrauterine devices (IUDs). I offer prenatal dating ultrasounds, ongoing prenatal care for desired pregnancies, and, yes, abortion care. When someone walks into my office pregnant, I am ready to support them with whatever choice they make — my patients don’t have to be referred to an additional clinic in order to get the care they need for themselves and their families. Though this kind of medicine may seem intuitive, this type of integrated care is hard to find in the U.S. Two days a week I work at an abortion clinic, where I perform abortions for people who don’t have access to a primary care clinic like mine. There will also always be people who need or prefer services at an abortion clinic. In this setting, I am meeting many patients for the first time, like the woman who came to see me from Texas, and I may never see them again. We play music, talk about their lives outside the office — their kids, the food they’re planning to eat afterwards, or how they’re going to spend their weekend. My team tries to make it a safe space where people can talk about their feelings and be supported. I often think about how fortunate I am to offer people this life-changing care that will alter their trajectory for the better. Science tells us it really is for the better when people are able to access the abortion care they want and need. After their abortions, most people express gratitude and relief, but a complex range of emotions are normal. The famous Turnaway Study looked at women who were “turned away” from wanted abortion care compared to those who were able to access the abortion care they needed. The study followed 8,000 women over five years and found that women who were able to get an abortion were better off on every metric examined — including mental health outcomes, poverty level, education and more. An astounding 99% of the women interviewed said they didn’t regret their decision to have an abortion. Please note that I am using “women” here because that is how the study was designed, but we know that people of all genders need and get abortions. In places where I use “women,” please know that data is not always gender-inclusive. The landmark case of Roe v. Wade made this all possible. It was restricted by later cases, such as Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, which applied a standard that states couldn’t impose an “undue burden” on people seeking abortion. This concept is not well defined, and many states have continue to use legal restrictions without medical basis to obstruct abortion access. Even though abortion has been technically legal in the United States for almost 50 years, it is extremely hard to access in many parts of the country. Long travel times and requirements for multiple appointments make it nearly impossible for many low-income and underserved communities to access abortion care. And then there’s the cost. The Hyde Amendment, which was first added as a rider to the federal spending budget in 1980 and has been added annually since then, makes it illegal for federal funds to cover the cost of abortion. This means that people employed by the government, armed service members, Indigenous people who are insured through the Indian Health Service, AmeriCorps workers, everyone whose insurance is federal Medicaid, and D.C. residents, among others, are required to pay for abortion out of pocket. Many states have banned public insurance programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare, from funding abortion as well. This means that the people with the lowest income in our country, who are disproportionately Black, Indigenous, and people of color, are also asked to pay the full cost of this essential medical care. In some states it’s even illegal for private insurance companies to offer coverage. After all, the United States is not a friendly place for pregnant people, infants, or children. The U.S. ranks approximately 57th in the world for maternal mortality according to the World Health Organization. This figure means that Americans die at a rate almost 10 times higher from childbirth complications than people in countries that have the lowest maternal mortality rates. Over 700 Americans died from childbirth in 2019 alone. Infant and early childhood deaths in the U.S. are not much better — we rank 47th. Those are stark numbers for a country that often claims to have the greatest health care on Earth. There’s a lot of reasons for this, but one of the biggest causes is poor access to comprehensive prenatal care and abortion care, particularly in marginalized communities. Pregnancy is risky for the body. It often worsens preexisting medical conditions and causes new ones. It is typical for people to suffer from worsened symptoms of asthma, blood pressure, and blood sugar — all of which can be life-threatening. During pregnancy, patients cannot get medical treatment for cancer, certain rheumatologic conditions, and other severe and life-threatening medical problems because the treatments available would cause potential harm or even the death of a fetus. Sometimes the pregnancy itself can cause death. It’s not a benign thing to ask someone to put their body through pregnancy. Even without medical concerns, all reasons for seeking abortion are valid and normal. Let’s be clear: Adoption isn’t an alternative to abortion. It’s an alternative to parenting. It’s also important to acknowledge that criminalizing abortion results in criminalizing pregnant people more broadly. There is no blood test for doctors to detect medication abortion pills in the body, and it is impossible to distinguish an abortion from miscarriage. Anyone who experiences pregnancy loss could be prosecuted if abortion is illegal. This isn’t theorizing — this is something that is already happening. In 2020, Brittney Poolaw, an Indigenous woman in Oklahoma, was sentenced to four years in prison for seeking medical care when she started bleeding during her pregnancy. Approximately one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage, putting every family at risk of legal scrutiny, but particularly people from marginalized communities like Poolaw. People have also been criminalized for seeking medical care during pregnancy deemed inappropriate by lawmakers, even when directed by their doctor. In 2019, Lindsay Rigdell was charged with child neglect after testing positive for cannabis. She had severe nausea and vomiting during her pregnancy, called hyperemesis gravidarum, and was treated with medical cannabis by her doctor in Arizona, where it was legal. Severe hyperemesis can also cause miscarriage, so either option would have left her open to criminal prosecution. These cases have garnered a lot of media attention, but there are countless more. Justice Alito asserts in his draft opinion that the word “abortion” does not appear in the Constitution, and he’s not wrong. Of course, at the time of its writing, the “people” were only land-owning white men. Since then, the law has expanded “people” to include women and Black and Indigenous people, among others. As the rest of us have gained the rights originally reserved for only land-owning white men, the right to bodily autonomy comes with our personhood. Let me give you an example. Overturning Roe v. Wade means that the government can mandate that someone use their body to support a developing fetus. This is completely inconsistent with the fact that no person is required to use their body to the benefit of someone else. If a newborn requires a life-saving blood transfusion, personal autonomy rights protect the person who just gave birth and they could not legally be compelled to donate the life-saving blood. So why would the government have the right to demand the use of their body for the previous nine months? It’s telling that Justice Alito’s opinion also states that there is no constitutional basis for Loving v. Virginia, the case that legalized interracial marriage, and Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage. In both of these cases, the rights asserted are for people who weren’t considered “people” in the original writing of the Constitution. As these groups have gained legal status in the U.S., however, there is no basis to argue that the rights already afforded to land-owning white men in the Constitution wouldn’t apply to everyone who has since been included in our country. It’s shocking to think the Supreme Court is asserting that these rights shouldn’t exist for Americans in 2022. Although abortion is a politically charged issue in the U.S., it’s a lot less controversial to everyday Americans. According to the Pew Research Center, in March 2022, 61% of Americans believed that abortion should be legal in all or most cases, a number that has gradually increased over the last few decades. Only 37% of Americans, on the other hand, believe it should be illegal in all or most cases. Most issues in the U.S. are much more contentious. Another important fact is that abortion used to be much less controversial. Abortion restrictions don’t begin to appear in the United States until the 1820s, and laws weren’t widespread until the American Medical Association started opposing abortion in the 1860s (the organization’s stance has since changed — the AMA now affirms that abortion is safe, essential health care). The opposition to abortion by doctors was largely driven by abortions being performed by midwives and women in the community, who doctors saw as a threat to their medical practice. That means that the legacy of abortion prohibition in this country only lasted for about 100 years, from the 1860s to 1973. The majority opinion for Roe v. Wade was written by Justice Harry Blackmun, a Republican. Even the widespread religious opposition to abortion in the U.S. is modern. Before Roe v. Wade, the Clergy Consultation Service for Abortion, made up of Protestant ministers and Jewish rabbis, helped connect people to safe abortion in the 1960s. Most major Protestant churches continued to support abortion rights after Roe v. Wade as a matter of their strong belief in religious freedom, specifically from the Catholic Church, who opposed abortion. The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest protestant group in the U.S., openly supported the court’s decision in 1973 and for years after. Nothing about abortion prohibition is fundamental to the cultural norms or common law of the U.S. In reality, the anti-abortion movement is rooted in white supremacist values, and the legacy of trying to control reproduction of Black and Brown people. When anti-abortion sentiment rose in the U.S., much of the concern focused on Black and Brown women having more children than white women. Though the anti-abortion movement has changed the way it frames this narrative, the patriarchal concept of purporting to know what’s best for the pregnant person remains unchanged. The pregnant person is always the most qualified to make decisions about their own bodies, not the government. All birthing people should have the ability to control their reproductive lives, which includes access to safe pregnancy or abortion care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the mortality rate for Black and Indigenous women is four to five times higher compared to their white counterparts, and maternal mortality in the U.S. is actually increasing, unlike most other countries. The same states trying to restrict abortion coincidentally also have the worst maternal and infant outcomes — and the worst racial disparities. Louisiana, a state rampant with abortion restrictions, has the highest maternal mortality rate in the country at three times the national average, with 59% of Black maternal deaths found to be “preventable” compared to only 9% of white maternal deaths. If anti-abortion activists want to be truly pro-family, I have some recommendations. Let’s put resources toward funding pregnancy and postpartum care. Why don’t we expand paid parental leave, something that has been shown to improve outcomes for children? We could fund child care costs and increase access to healthy food. We should require infertility treatment as part of insurance coverage, giving people from all socioeconomic backgrounds the tools to build their families — reproductive freedom means you have access to both. Let’s focus our money and time on addressing the grotesque maternal health disparities found between Black and white communities. Finally, I want to dispel the idea that the fall of Roe v. Wade could take us back to 1973, when self-managed abortion was often dangerous. Many of us conjure the image of a coat hanger when thinking about the repercussions of anti-abortion laws. Today, we have medication abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol, which is a much safer alternative. Telemedicine clinics like Hey Jane are a great option for people who want a doctor-led medication abortion. People in hostile states are turning to the internet to self-manage with abortion pills by ordering them online and having them delivered. Websites like Plan C and Aid Access are resources for anyone looking to self-manage an abortion. If you have concerns or questions about a self-managed abortion, there are places to get confidential medical advice from clinicians — check out the M+A Hotline. What can we do now? My patient from Texas was able to pay for her own flight and hotel to access abortion care; this is rare. Many people turn to abortion funds for help. These are community organizations that attempt to cover the cost of the procedure, travel, and other expenses but rely on donations and just don’t have enough money to help everyone in need. If you are looking for a place to start, to help people who need care, check out the National Network of Abortion Funds. Become a member, make a donation to the broad group of abortion funds or pick one that directly impacts your community — everything helps. If you need care, check out their resources and get connected to support. We can support legislative initiatives that would allow clinicians to provide telemedicine abortion care across state lines, from “blue” states into “red” states. All of us can make our voices heard: protest, post on social media, call your lawmakers, make noise! We know that one in four women in this country has had an abortion and everyone loves someone who has had an abortion. If it’s safe for you, break the stigma and silence surrounding abortion care and tell your story. Together, we can change the narrative on pregnancy and abortion on this country — after all, we are already the majority. "
4,Opinion: The Ban On Menthol Cigarettes Has Nothing To Do With Black Health,opinion," Opinion Editor I’m in the back of my parents’ red Ford Monarch. The sky is clear, and the night air is still too warm for a jacket. My father is driving, and the smoke from his Kool Mild hits me like an anvil. I’m seatbelt-less. The window is halfway down. It looks like the moon is chasing our car. This was back in the ’80s, when Bill Cosby was a god; back when cars were made like tanks, and everyone had a telephone in their home. Back when cable was only a few channels, and a smoker could smoke anywhere: in the office, restaurants, and if you were nice with it, even on a public bus. I’ve seen it. We were wild back then; no one cared back then. Everyone appears to care now ― about Black lungs, about Black health. The government is planning to ban menthol cigarettes, and it feels racist-y. Let me explain. In 1925, Lloyd “Spud” Hughes wasn’t feeling so hot. He was an avid smoker, but he’d picked up a cold somewhere. One night he put his smoking tobacco next to his menthol crystals, and the next day menthol cigarettes were born. Before this, cigarettes had tasted like trash. But for some reason, white men and some white women still smoked them. It was a luxury item for rich folks (remember those long black cigarette holders from all of those black-and-white movies? Looking at you, “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”), and as such, Black folks didn’t partake. Eventually, though, cigarette makers realized something: Because they didn’t target African Americans, Black people weren’t smoking cigarettes. So that all changed. In the 1970s and ’80s, the makers of Kools began sponsoring jazz festivals, and their advertisements started featuring dimly lit images of a saxophone player. Even the spelling of “Kool” with a “K” was used to target Black people, since that was hip talk at the time. Kool and Newports changed their marketing campaigns to aggressively target Black folks in the two most prominent African American publications, Ebony and Jet, which reached a third of the adult Black population. Almost a third of the ads in both magazines were for cigarettes. And it worked: Blacks became the largest users of menthol cigarettes. In 1964, after researching some 7,000 articles, Surgeon General Luther Terry concluded that cigarette smoking led to lung cancer and heart disease. Surely, this would be enough to take the product off the market? Nope. Despite Terry’s insistence that the government do something about cigarettes, they just kept on allowing them to be sold. Oh, wait, that isn’t entirely true. They did issue a warning that appeared on the side of the packaging, acknowledging that cigarette smoking is dangerous for your health ― but they didn’t do it until 1969, some five years after Terry’s findings. That language would be changed in 1984 after Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act of 1984, which required that all cigarette packaging and advertisements carry the following message: “SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, and May Complicate Pregnancy.” This brings us to the Heckler report. Before 1985, no one really cared about health disparities based on race. Well, maybe they cared, but no one kept track of it until 1985, when U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler released the Report of the Secretary’s Task Force on Black & Minority Health, marking the first time the U.S. government looked at whether race played a part in health care. One of the report’s most shocking findings was that some 60,000 excess deaths occurred in the U.S. each year due to health disparities. This was about as close as America had come to admitting that racism exists in medical care. It was the first time race and health care converged on a national stage. Inside the voluminous report, there was a finding that Blacks suffered more than their white counterparts from high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. If America could do a study of this scope in 1985 (the task force was created in 1984, and the report was released the following year), surely they could’ve taken a look at the effects that menthol cigarettes had on Black people, especially since it had long been rumored that menthol made cigarettes easier to smoke and harder to quit. But that study wouldn’t be done until 1998. And the 1998 Surgeon General’s report “Tobacco Use Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups” found one minor caveat that no one seemed to care about then. “Black smokers smoke less but die of heart attacks, strokes and other causes linked to tobacco use at higher rates than white smokers do, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” a New York Times article noted last year. “And 85 percent of Black smokers use Newport, Kool and other menthol brands that are easier to become addicted to and harder to quit than plain tobacco.” This means Black smokers were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes and, as such, were more likely to die. America knew this in 1998. Want to know how long ago that was? Today, a child who was born in 1998 can drive a car, go to war and legally purchase and smoke menthol cigarettes. So we know, at the very least, that America was aware of the dangers of smoking menthol cigarettes some 24 years ago, and did nothing to stop it. But before we look at why the ban to stop menthol cigarettes from ravishing the Black community is suddenly happening now, let’s look at the effects that menthol had on the industry. Adding menthol to tobacco lessened the harsh taste and made cigarettes easier to smoke. So why not create all kinds of flavors to entice new smokers? Well, in recent years, that’s precisely what flavored e-cigarettes did, with great new tastes like Gummy Bear, Funnel Cake, Fruit Punch, Berry Crunch Cereal and Blueberry Lemonade. Surely that lasted for some time, considering how long menthol was on the market? Nope. Shortly after those flavors hit the market, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned them. “Flavors attract them. Nicotine addicts them,” Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said late last year. “Without the flavors, many fewer kids would be attracted to these products — 85% of the kids who use an e-cigarette use a flavored one.” But it wasn’t just the assortment of flavors. It was menthol. “Flavors are a top reason why young people begin using e-cigarettes,” an April 22 report by Truth Initiative reads. “Research shows that mint and menthol e-cigarette use among high school users rose from 16% in 2016 to 57.3% in 2019. Among high school JUUL users, 67.5% reported that their preferred flavor was mint or menthol. Another study, conducted before JUUL pulled its other flavors from the market, found that mint was one of the most popular flavors among high school student JUUL users, but that menthol was less so.” “Study authors caution that leaving mint and menthol flavors on the market undermines the purpose of removing flavors — which is to prevent kids from using e-cigarettes at all,” the report notes. White males are the most likely to use e-cigarettes. See where I’m going here? No need to belabor the point. I don’t have a memory of my father that isn’t clouded in smoke from a Kool Mild. He never stopped smoking. Not after two heart attacks, not after he stopped eating. My last memory of my father is from around my birthday. I’d taken my kids to see him. He was frail and could barely hold himself upright. He shuffled to walk my family out of the house, and waved as we pulled off. I could see in my rearview mirror that he was lighting a cigarette. The ban on menthol cigarettes is long overdue, but America knows that. Black lives have always been a byproduct of white life, our safety a spinoff. It’s the impetus of the Black Lives Matter movement ― you know, the part that always gets left out, implicitly saying, “Don’t I matter, too?” Opinion Editor"
5,"Opinion: Republicans’ Temper Tantrums Should Hurt Them At The Ballot Box. Instead, They’re Hurting Democrats.",opinion," Opinion Editor North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R) is not a good person. For starters, he’s a liar. During his 2020 campaign, he claimed that in 2014 he was on his way to the Naval Academy when a car crash left him paralyzed from the waist down. He has also noted that he was a successful businessman. But both claims were lies. Cawthorn had already been rejected from the Naval Academy before the car accident occurred and, according to tax records, the real-estate investment firm that he founded in 2019 claimed no income. But that didn’t matter to his constituents, who were pleased to elect the youngest member of Congress believing him to be an astute real estate businessman who was on his way to serving the country before an unfortunate twist of fate. But Cawthorn didn’t stop there. Since taking office, he’s claimed that he was training for the 2020 Paralympic Games until his disability began to worsen, causing him to opt out. The problem with the statement is that no one in the Paralympics was familiar with Cawthorn’s possible participation. While the statement isn’t necessarily false, it’s most likely untrue. Let me explain. Before I got married, I would tell women I was dating that I was well on my way to playing in the NBA until an unfortunate knee injury ruined my basketball dreams. If you asked anyone in the NBA, they would give you some of the same stunning, quizzical looks that Ketanji Brown Jackson gave during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing. But that doesn’t mean I didn’t believe that my training wasn’t going to get me to the league. My assessment of Cawthorn is not a personal reflection: One of the lawmaker’s former staff members has called him a “bad person” and a “habitual liar.” “As far as the candidate himself, I mean, he’s just a bad person,” former staffer Lisa Wiggins said in a secretly recorded phone call with David Wheeler, the president of a political action committee called Fire Madison Cawthorn. “He’s a habitual liar and he’s going to say and do anything he can to your face but behind your back, he’s completely opposite,” she added. Wiggins went on to note that his district office was littered with alcohol bottles and added that there was more liquor in his office than water, because he treats the place like a frat house. Which is ironic, considering he was caught lying about Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) being an alcoholic when she doesn’t even drink. And we can’t forget the whale of a whopper (maybe?) he told about being invited to orgies and seeing Congress members doing cocaine in front of him. He was finally reprimanded for this statement by his fellow Republicans. But here’s the rub. Despite all of these tall tales that would likely sink a Democrat’s political future and all but ensure that they would be a one-term politician, Cawthorn is merely in a tight race for his seat. This appears to be the way for the Republican Party: Candidates can be as vile, despicable, untrustworthy, horrid, deplorable, unpatriotic and whatever other adjectives one would use to describe Florida Sen. Ted Cruz, as they want while Democrats are forced to be the parents in the room. Currently, Democrats are facing tough questions around inflation, the war in Ukraine, gas prices, housing prices and climate change. As it stands, Republicans’ latest hustle appears to be blaming President Joe Biden for everything from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (they claimed it only happened because Biden is weak) to high gas prices (he’s holding back production of oil in the United States). The shots against the president were so bad that Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) came to his defense after the House Republicans official Twitter account tweeted a photo of Biden walking away from a podium with the caption: “This is what weakness on the world stage looks like.” As still “technically” a member of house Republicans, let me, with all my might, condemn this damn awful tweet during this crisis.  You can criticize policy but this is insane and feeds into Putins narrative.  But hey, retweets amirite? https://t.co/1b22DGMENl It’s not just an attempt to undermine the presidency. It falls in line with what appears to be the Republican agenda: tear the country apart while pushing wild conspiracy theories and manufactured beefs. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) has said that Muslims don’t belong in government; mass shootings in Parkland, Sandy Hook and Las Vegas were staged; and California wildfires were not natural events but were actually started by secret Jewish space lasers — and she believed all of this before she was elected to Congress. Currently, the junior varsity Trump, Ron DeSantis, is in a fight with Disney over his state’s draconian and mind-numbingly stupid “Don’t Say Gay” bill. While America has its eyes on the unprovoked war in Ukraine, the Florida governor is in an all-out war with “The Greatest Place on Earth.” Because Congress is not a unified front, Democrats are busy governing the country and putting out Jewish laser forest fires that Republicans keep starting. Congress has never been a happy home, but what used to be outliers to a fundamental way of thinking have now become the basis of the aluminum foil party. They’re wasting time fighting imaginary wars against so-called cancel culture (which does not exist) and “wokeism,” which for the uninitiated can easily be defined as anything that goes against GOP doctrine. By tearing down the fourth wall of decorum, Republicans have created a playroom that allows for meltdowns, temper tantrums, out-there theories and unsubstantiated statements, which enables them to be full-bodied politicians who can present however they choose. The party that once prided itself as fiscally responsible or closer to God than the rest of us is now the party of insurrections, crusades against critical race theory and defending Russian President Vladimir Putin — and they aren’t losing voters because of it. It’s like one day the Republican party had a spine — albeit a significantly crooked spine that pointed to archaic jurisprudence and racism — but a spine nonetheless, and then Donald Trump took office and blunt, off-the-cuff, unadulterated and unfiltered soundbites became the new GOP. This isn’t the party that former president and GOP god Ronald Reagan exemplified; in fact, Reagan probably wouldn’t sit at this Republican cafeteria table. But this is the shakily built political landscape that we live in, in which up is down and the right is allowed to be not only batshit crazy but potentially criminal. Currently, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is facing accusations that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl and engaged in sex trafficking. Not only has he not resigned from office, but he’s one of the most outspoken politicians in Congress. Ohio Sen. Jim Jordan’s entire time in public office will forever be shrouded by the claims from former Ohio State wrestlers that, during his time as an assistant wrestling coach, Jordan knew that the student athletes were being sexually assaulted and did nothing to stop it. And don’t forget that in 2018, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore was so allegedly predatory that The New Yorker reported that he was banned from a local mall because he preyed on teens — and he barely lost his election. But I’m sure there is an explanation as to how Republicans lost their moral compass. If we could only get access to Hillary Clinton’s emails or Hunter Biden’s laptop, I’m sure we’d find it.

6,Opinion: How The NFL Co-Opted Colin Kaepernick’s Movement And Still Won’t Give Him A Chance,opinion," Opinion Editor August 2016. That was the first time San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem. No one noticed. Not one person said anything, until a Black reporter (this is why diversity matters) asked Kaepernick if his remaining seated during the patriotic song had political meaning. It did. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses Black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” Before Kaepernick took a knee, Michael Brown happened. Tamir Rice happened. Walter Scott, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile all happened. Black America was still in the bargaining phase of grief. We were willing to barter our way to humankind; literally negotiating with systemic racism, yelling, “Aren’t I a person, too?” Black Lives Matter was never a rallying cry against humanity, it was always a petition for it. It was as much a statement as it was a question. It was less authoritative and more rhetorical, because at the rate that Black blood was being spilled, Black America needed to know if our lives meant anything to the people who were killing us. After Kaepernick’s protest Stephon Clark happened. Breonna Taylor happened. And then, George Floyd happened. On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd’s neck for some nine minutes and America couldn’t look away. Whatever excuses Americans could make as to why Tamir Rice was shot and killed, or how many items Micheal Brown allegedly took from a corner store before his death, they couldn’t make sense of an officer kneeling on the neck of a man who literally begged for his life. It’s amazing that the story of America’s racist history can be boiled down to two knees: one kneeling against injustice and the other literally on the neck of a Black man until he died. The NFL like much of corporate America was forced to make a decision: admit that Black Lives Matter or quickly find itself on the wrong side of history. Everyone caved. They always do. But not because they cared. They just didn’t want to lose money. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell released an 81-second video filmed in the basement of his home in Bronxville, New York, basically stating that Colin Kaepernick was right all along. “We, the National Football League, condemn racism and the systematic oppression of Black people,” Goodell said, in what can only be considered the biggest act of bullshit known to man. “We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest. We, the National Football League, believe Black lives matter.” The NFL didn’t just acknowledge systematic racism toward Black people. It started a social justice program and pledged some $250 million over 10 years to combat it. Yes, Goodell, the commissioner of the National Football League, the same league in which at least seven owners donated $1 million to Donald Trump, claimed and committed money to ending systemic racism, and then continued to systematically oppress Colin Kaepernick. Of course, the league didn’t come right out and say that it was systematically oppressing Kaepernick. Teams kept coming up with excuses, like he didn’t want to play anymore or he wouldn’t be a backup, to explain why Kaepernick wasn’t the right fit. On Monday, free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick, 34, single-handedly dispelled every myth that the National Football League has used to argue why the socially conscious former gunslinger is no longer in the league. In a rare interview, Kaepernick, appearing on the popular “I AM ATHLETE” podcast hosted by Brandon Marshall, Chad Johnson and Pacman Jones, told the former NFL players that he still wants to play. “Absolutely,” Kaepernick said. “That’s without question. To your point, what you saw out here, that’s five years of training behind the scenes, to make sure I’m ready and stay ready at the highest level. You don’t do that if you don’t have a passion, [if] you don’t believe you’re gonna find a way on that field.” But what about the rumor that Kaepernick would not play the backup quarterback position? Kaepernick claims that was never true. “I know I have to find my way back in,” Kaepernick said. “So, yeah, if I have to come in as a backup, that’s fine. But that’s not where I’m staying. And when I prove that I’m a starter, I want to be able to step on the field as such. I just need that opportunity to walk through the door. ... More than anything, we’re just looking for a chance to walk through a door. I’ll handle the rest from there.” So if Kaepernick wants to play and is willing to play for the league minimum and serve as a backup, then why isn’t he in the NFL? “No team’s brought me in for a workout,” Kaepernick said. “No team has brought me in for an opportunity. I had the one meeting with Seattle in 2017. And out of that, [coach] Pete Carroll said, ‘Hey, he’s a starter, we have a starter.’ And things moved on from there. But they don’t have a starter right now.” And yet there have been no talks of Kaepernick finding an NFL home. There have been no scheduled workouts, no looks at him backing up a quarterback. Nothing. But NFL knows that it wouldn’t be this socially conscious or connected had it not been for Kaepernick’s protest. “We wouldn’t be where we are today without the work Colin and other players have led off,” a person close to the league told NFL.com. “That is a key point here. We listened to our players. We needed to listen more, we needed to move faster. We heard them and launched a social justice platform because of what Colin was protesting about. The players have always been an essential piece of this effort and this campaign. It would be awesome to engage Colin on some of the work we are doing. He’s doing real impactful work. Getting him in some way would be amazing for us. There’s a lot of work to do to get to that point. We’re certainly open and willing to do that.” So then what gives? White Lives Matter. Despite white people having a less avid NFL fan base than Black people, the league would still rather cater to those white fans who may be offended by having a socially conscious quarterback on the field. And remember, the NFL and Kaepernick are now supposedly on the same team. They both believe that Black Lives Matter, they both believe that systemic racism not only exists but oppresses Black people, and they both have committed themselves to change. “You have ‘End Racism’ in the back of your end zone,” Kaepernick said. “You have ‘Black Lives Matter’ on your helmet. Everything I’ve said should be in alignment with what you’re saying publicly. It’s a $16 billion business. When I first took a knee, my jersey went to No. 1. When I did the deal with Nike, their value increased by $6 billion. Six billion. With a ‘b.’ ... So if you’re talking about the business side, it shows [it’s] beneficial. If you’re talking about the playing side, come in [and] let me compete. You can evaluate me from there. The NFL’s supposed to be a meritocracy. Come in, let me compete. If I’m not good enough, get rid of me. But let me come in and show you.” That won’t happen because the NFL keeps fumbling the ball on race. Often on purpose. The league is currently being sued by former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores, who, back in February, accused the league and its 32 teams of hosting sham interviews and discriminating against Black coaches. Flores has since been hired as an assistant coach by Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin (one of three Black head coaches in the NFL) and the league is still trying to send its top lawyers to quell the notion that the NFL is not exactly what it appears to be. Meanwhile, Kaepernick is out here waiting, hoping that someone will take a chance on him to prove that he can still play. And it’s funny, because after all the years, the NFL is looking more and more like America’s most racist sport, especially now that NASCAR has more Black race car owners than the NFL has Black head coaches. But please, NFL, tell me more about systemic racism and how bad it is. Opinion Editor"
7,"Opinion: It's Been 75 Years, And People Still Don't Give Jackie Robinson His Respect",opinion," A philosopher of race teaching in the Bible Belt. This year, on April 15, every player on every Major League Baseball team will wear the number 42 to mark 75 years since Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier and integrated professional sports. Commentators will comment on his patience with white fans so filled with hate that they sent him death threats almost daily. People will talk about how he gave his fellow baseball players — who were suspicious of his presence — time to adjust to his being on the field. They might even mention his years of service in the United States Army and his arrest by military police after he refused a white bus driver’s command for him to sit in the back of an unsegregated bus line set up by the military. People will say all these things on Jackie Robinson Day in Major League Baseball — and they are all true. But what gets lost in all this talk about Robinson as a great civil rights figure is that he was also a great athlete. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, while in college, Robinson was UCLA’s first four-sport varsity athlete — not the first Black one. The first — period. The man ran track and field, played football, basketball, and, of course, baseball. Seemingly, Robinson excelled in any sport that he played. After leaving the military, he just focused on baseball and became a star. In 1945, he was offered $400 a month to play for the Kansas City Monarchs, a Negro League team, and batted a .387 while registering 13 stolen bases. He was so good that year that he played in the East-West All-Star game; he was placed on a list of Negro League players who would likely excel in the major leagues. Then, in 1946, Branch Rickey, the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, chose to champion Robinson and gave him a chance to earn his way onto a major league team — and that point needs to be underlined. Robinson was not given an opportunity because he was Black; this was not affirmative action: baseball edition. Rickey was not some benevolent white man who pushed Robinson for the betterment of all mankind. He knew that there were good players in the Negro Leagues. He just had to find the right one who had talent and could deal with the pressure of being the “first.” Once the first made it, it would open the door to the untapped talent waiting to take over the league. So, Robinson started this journey with the Montreal Royals, a AAA team. Once he joined the team, it took him some time to find the proper position, but he dominated once he moved from shortstop to second base. He led that league with a .349 batting average and a .985 fielding percentage and was named most valuable player. Like I said: the man could ball. He was such a well-rounded athlete that after he finished with Montreal — just before he joined the Brooklyn Dodgers — he killed time by playing professional basketball with a team called the Los Angeles Red Devils. Robinson broke the color barrier on April 15, 1947, when he took the field as a Brooklyn Dodger. In his rookie year, he dominated. He played in 151 games that year for the Dodgers with a batting average of .297 and an on-base percentage of .383. He had 175 hits and scored 125 runs. He also led the league in stolen bases, which was prominent in the Negro League, but not so much in the Major Leagues, with 29. His ability to steal bases drove pitchers crazy and, ultimately, changed the game. People saw how a great base runner could transform the dynamics of a game and began implementing Robinson’s style of play. Robinson had such an overwhelming overall performance that first year that he earned the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award. And this was all done while he continued to receive death threats from baseball fans and was treated harshly by other teams (most notably the St. Louis Cardinals — a reason why I can’t stand that team to this day). He only played in the Major Leagues for 10 years and had six All-Star appearances. He was named the National League MVP in 1949, the National League batting champion in 1949, and a World Series Champion in 1955. Yeah, Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier — and he should be remembered for that. Yet, what we should not let happen, what we cannot let happen, is to forget that he was also an incredible athlete. Remember that he was not given anything. He earned everything he received. The man was an outstanding athlete. Don’t let anyone tell you any different. A philosopher of race teaching in the Bible Belt."
8,Opinion: Bowen Turner's Sexual Assault Cases Prove The Justice System Is Working Just Fine,opinion," Opinion Editor If you’ve not heard of Bowen Turner, don’t worry — that’s by design. See, Turner is a 19-year-old South Carolina man who since 2018 has been charged with two sexual assaults. In one case, the alleged victim is now dead. In the another, the alleged victim watched as he violated the terms of his house arrest at least 20 times — and on Friday learned that he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge that won’t even have him register as a sex offender. There was a third allegation, but law enforcement never brought charges. To this day, Turner is free. And all of this proves one thing: The judicial system is working just fine. I don’t want to bore you with details, but in 1789 or thereabout, a bunch of white men decided “to establish the judicial courts of the United States,” which was signed into law by the president, the founding father George Washington. The system created by white men, for white men was basically enacted to issue justice fairly and properly to white men, because no one else mattered but white men. Slaves (Black people) couldn’t even testify against white men, and even if they were hit by a white person, they (slaves, Black people), couldn’t hit them back. White women were leaps and bounds above slaves, but they were still less than white men. They didn’t have the right to own property, they couldn’t keep their own money, and they couldn’t vote. But they were still considered a person — granted a second-class citizen, but a citizen nonetheless. Basically, “White Cis-Male Lives Matter,” and little has changed since then. Which brings us back to Turner. In 2018, Turner, then 16, was at a party with Dallas Stoller. Stoller was a popular teen who was the president of her senior class. Stoller came home from the party, intoxicated and covered in bruises, and reportedly told her father that Turner had sexually assaulted her. “It was very upsetting obviously, and very disheartening,” her father, Karl Stoller, told South Carolina outlet WCSC. “And very, I like to use the word, ‘tragic,’ once we found out who the alleged individual was.” Turner was arrested and charged with first-degree criminal sexual conduct in Bamberg County in January of 2019, according to public records cited by WCSC. He was required to wear a GPS monitor and was released on bond. After only a few months, the judge allowed him to remove the monitor. Six months after his first arrest, Turner, who was still out on bond, was arrested again and charged for a second time with first-degree criminal sexual conduct. The victim, who was 16 at the time of the assault, claimed that the incident happened at a party in Orangeburg County in June 2019. While minors are not usually named in sexual assault cases, Chloe Bess has since come forward to say that she was the victim of the alleged 2019 assault. Chloe Bess claims that she walked outside of the pond house, where the party was happening, to call a friend when Turner approached her. Bess told authorities that Turner pulled her behind a truck, pulled her to the ground, yanked her shirt down and then pulled off her pants and underwear and “forced himself sexually” on her. “I just remember being so petrified, like, I was frozen,” Bess said. “I honestly just remember sitting there looking at the stars just praying for it to be done, waiting for it to be over with, so I could run away.” Turner was initially denied bond. But that was granted after only a few months, and he was given another GPS monitor and put on house arrest. He was only to leave the house to see his attorney, for mental health appointments or for a medical emergency. Court documents found that he violated this order as much has wanted — “including 19 trips to golf courses, as well as outings to restaurants, sporting goods stores and even a car dealership,” WCSC reported. He even left the city to visit Columbia and Graniteville. He also took a trip to Brunswick, Georgia, because why not? It’s not like anyone was going to do anything about it. “[He has] multiple bond violations,” Darren Bess, Chloe’s father, says. “He was out on bond when this happened to Chloe. It’s like he keeps getting pass after pass after pass.” Maybe that’s because Turner’s attorney is powerful state Sen. Brad Hutto, who promptly took to the courtroom to slut-shame Bess. From the Times and Democrat: Hutto argued that after the incident, the victim allegedly said, “I felt ashamed.” “Well, guess what? You just had sex on the ground with a boy you didn’t really know and you got up and you feel ashamed, you feel regret, that’s not rape,” Hutto said. Hutto said Turner and the victim were mutually engaging in sexual behaviors with each other at the party. “She did not object, she did not scratch, she did not push, she did not call out. When asked point blank if she said, ‘no,’ she didn’t. When asked point blank if she said ‘stop,’ she didn’t,” Hutto said. And get this: The first-degree criminal sexual conduct charge against Turner in the alleged Stoller incident has been dismissed because Stoller died in November 2021 and therefore can’t testify. “Where are the victims’ rights?” Brette Tabatabai, Stoller’s sister, asked. “There are no victims’ rights. It’s been 3-and-a-half years, where are they? And he’s dismissing that because she’s passed away.” The Stoller family didn’t say how Dallas died, but they told WCSC that the gossip and stress from the alleged incident weighed heavily on the young woman even after high school. On Friday, Turner pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of assault and battery, allowing him to avoid having to register as a sex offender. “Circuit Judge Markley Dennis sentenced him under the Youthful Offender Act not to exceed six years, suspended to five years of probation. The probation term may not be shortened,” The Times and Democrat reports. “It’s like when you go into a convenience store and you rob it at gunpoint, but then you get charged with stealing a candy bar,” Bess said. It’s almost as if America doesn’t want white men to go to jail. I mean surely America knows that white men commit crimes, but they are less likely to serve prison time for their offenses. I know. It sounds like I’m basing my entire position on conjecture and hyperbole, so let’s look at stats. According to a study done by The Color of Justice, “Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly 5 times the rate of white Americans.” And, more importantly, “In 12 states, more than half the prison population is Black: Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.” And if you want to argue that Turner was a teen when he allegedly committed sexual assault, then let’s take a look at those numbers, too. “Black youth are more than four times as likely to be detained or committed in juvenile facilities as their white peers, according to nationwide data collected in October 2019 and recently released. In 2015, Black youth’s incarceration rate was 5.0 times as high as their white peers,” according to a study done by the Sentencing Project. “Forty-one percent of youths in placement are Black, even though Black Americans comprise only 15% of all youth across the United States. Black youth are more likely to be in custody than white youth in every state but one: Hawaii.” The entire time that I’ve been working on this piece, I kept trying to figure out when Bowen Turner attended Stanford and when he joined the Stanford swim team. And then it dawned on me that I’ve been thinking about Brock Turner, another white man accused of sexual assault who served some three months in jail even after two students found him on top of an unconscious woman and held him there until police arrived. The judge believed that a longer sentence would’ve had a “severe impact” on Turner. Brock Turner and Bowen Turner are not related. I just have a faulty recollection of white men who evade prison for horrific crimes. “I do believe in my heart that there’s a good possibility that things would be different if things were done like they were supposed to be — if justice was served like it was supposed to be,” Tabatabai said. I don’t know how to tell Tabatabai that justice has been served. The justice system has done exactly what it was designed to do. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified Karl Stoller as Turner’s father. Opinion Editor"
9,Opinion: The Business Of Black Death And A $6 Million Mansion,opinion," Opinion Editor Ferguson tried to warn us. For America, Ferguson, Missouri, has always been a barometer of Black life. During the 1960s, when race relations in the country were frayed, Ferguson was a sundown town where Black people dared not drive once nighttime came. By the time Michael Brown walked into the convenience store on Aug. 9, 2014, Ferguson demographics had shifted entirely. White flight changed the St. Louis suburb to roughly 67% Black, and Brown committed the egregious sin of walking in the street while melanated. An encounter with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson would leave Brown dead, and the next night, Ferguson was on fire. The protests were as violent as Brown’s killing, and out of the ashes came this message: There would be no more Black death without consequences. You will feel us now. Darren Seals tried to warn us. “BLACK DEATH IS A BUSINESS.” That was how Seals, a former Ferguson activist, used to make sense of the financial windfall and the galvanization of Black faces that converged on his city shortly after Brown’s death. Seals would argue that Black Lives Matter as an organization was nothing more than a money grab with a catchy hashtag used to seize the moment and capitalize on Black pain. Seals would argue, before his untimely and horrific death, that these people weren’t with Ferguson from the beginning, so why were they here now? During one of his videotaped messages, he had this to say about the group: “This Black Lives Matter shit is blowing up and as it’s blowing up, you’re not hearing about Mike Brown anymore. ... All you’re hearing about is Black Lives Matter now. They took the energy away from Ferguson.” “Cops ain’t stopped killing here since Mike Brown died, and what Black Lives Matter doing about it? They just collecting checks. I ain’t heard of them paying for no funerals. I ain’t heard of them starting no programs for the youth, building no centers. Nothing. So we back at square one, back where we started. No justice, no nothing.” Ferguson tried to warn us that the Black Lives Matter organization was not the sacred cow that it appeared to be. Since the hashtag’s founding in 2013 by three Black women — Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi — as an answer to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, there have been questions surrounding money. Garza and Tometi are not affiliated with the business side of Black Lives Matter, but they do host speaking engagements on behalf of the hashtag. Garza heads Black Futures Lab, and Tometi founded Diaspora Rising, which calls itself a Black new media and advocacy hub, according to The Associated Press. Only Cullors was affiliated with the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation until May 2021. So let me try and explain it so it all makes sense: Cullors, Garza and Tometi created the hashtag that would later go on to encapsulate the movement. Cullors would go on to head the foundation. But there are also local Black Lives Matter groups that aren’t affiliated with the foundation, which appears to be the national organization that’s raking in all the money. And that is where the story about stories begins. There have been stories, several of them, wondering where all of the donations have gone. In 2020 after George Floyd’s death shook the nation to its core, the Black Lives Matter foundation took in $90 million. There have been questions surrounding what the money was spent on, if anything, and how that helps the community the organization has mined. And then there was a bombshell dropped earlier this week that the foundation took some $6 million of donation money to secretly buy a mansion. And not just any mansion: a spread in Southern California with “more than 6,500 square feet, more than half a dozen bedrooms and bathrooms, several fireplaces, a soundstage, a pool and bungalow, and parking for more than 20 cars,” according to New York Magazine, which broke the news. Because everyone knows that the Movement for Black Lives — a movement that rose to prominence on the deaths of unarmed Black men, women and children by police — needs multiple fireplaces. This latest news comes after a 2021 report that Cullors purchased four homes throughout the U.S. for some $3.2 million. Cullors would later announce that she was stepping down from her position at the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. What is telling here is that somewhere between the fight for Black lives and the pull of celebrity, things changed, lines got crossed, and accountability and transparency got skewed. In a lengthy Instagram post, Cullors argues that the magazine’s reporting on the purchase of a secret mansion is both “sexist” and “racist,” but she doesn’t explain how. This is actually a common refrain from the former foundation head whenever confronted with questions about finances, or really anything for that matter, and it works like this: You either fully accept everything happening within the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, which apparently includes filming a cooking show using the mansion’s kitchen, or you are a tool of white supremacy being used to shut down one of the largest Black organizations fighting for Black life. She claims that the mansion was purchased as a “space where those within the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (BLMGNF) and broader movement community could work, create content, host meetings and foster creativity.” So it was basically a WeWork for BLM, although no one can point to any work that was actually done there. Cullors also noted that she is no longer affiliated with the foundation but did claim that all of this would be cleared up once the organization releases its tax documents ― which, according to the original report, never mentioned the SoCal mansion. Earlier this year, New York Magazine found that Cullors’ connections to other fundraising efforts runs deep. One group she’s been linked to is Reform LA Jails, which reportedly collected more than $1.4 million in 2019. From the January article: “About $205,000 went to a company Cullors operates with her spouse, Janaya & Patrisse Consulting. And about $86,000 was paid to Trap Heals LLC, an entertainment, clothing, and consulting company started by Damon Turner, the father of Patrisse Cullors’s child.” The group also reportedly sent “some $211,000 to Asha Bandele, a friend of Cullors’s who co-wrote her memoir,” and another $270,000 to the consulting company of Christman Bowers, who “has signed tax documents as the deputy executive director” of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation ― which reportedly had $60 million in the bank as of early 2021. None of this is to claim that there was any wrongdoing on the part of Reform LA, Cullors, or anyone else affiliated with those organizations, as they were most likely paid for their work, but it does point to profit being made off of Black death. This is the byproduct of Black death when there is no one there to shepherd the guilt payoff. And that’s exactly what it is, a payoff to absolve companies for not caring before Black death became national news. With the advent of the Black Lives Matter foundation and other organizations like it, companies now have a place where they can dump money or create partnerships and absolve themselves of their corporate responsibility. Black Lives Matter Inc. is a business, and the business appears to be coddling those complicit in Black death. No longer do companies need to atone for their wayward hiring practices or for collectively turning away from the killings of Black men, women and children. Now, they can be completely absolved with a hefty donation to the movement. Like when the footwear company Ugg and the Hammer Museum sponsored Cullors to throw what can only be called the dumbest dance party ever, titled “F*ck White Supremacy, Let’s Get Free” — which featured a call for everyone to Electric Slide white supremacy away. I wish I was joking: But Samaria Rice and Mike Brown Sr. and several other parents who lost their children to police violence tried to warn us that the trickle-down financial effects of the Black Lives Matter movement weren’t reaching any of those suffering through the loss of their loved ones. After learning that the Black Lives Matter foundation received some $90 million in donations, Brown Sr. and other activists demanded a share of the proceeds. “We’re asking that Black Lives Matter leadership funds $20 million to Ferguson organizers, organizations, and community foundations to do the work,” said Tory Russell, co-founder of the International Black Freedom Alliance, in a video with Brown Sr. “We’re not begging for a handout; we’re coming for what we deserve.” “What kind of movement are we building where we’re saying ‘Black Lives Matter’ but the freedom fighters and the families are being left behind?” Russell said. “Where’s our restitution? Where’s our organizing? Where’s our building of a movement?” As of last year, Brown Sr. said he had only received $500 from any Black Lives Matter organization despite the millions of dollars raised in his son’s name. Meanwhile, Rice, the mother of Tamir Rice, responded to news of the $6 million mansion in a Facebook post: “Smdh. I tried to tell you all. People will use your pain for their own gain and really think it’s OK.” Later that same day she posted: “My baby boy needs justice. He’s not your hustle.” Opinion Editor"
10,"OPINION: Major League Baseball Starts Today, and the Defending World Series Champs’ Team Name Still Honors Genocide",opinion," Kevin Bruyneel is a professor of Politics at Babson College in Wellesley, MA. The 2022 Major League Baseball season is finally about to begin. This season will mark the first year that the Cleveland baseball team will be known as the Guardians rather than the Indians. This is a positive step toward respect for Indigenous people. However, this change sits in tension with the fact that the defending World Series champions are the Atlanta Braves. The Braves organization has made no change to its team name or logo, or made any serious effort to get their fans to stop performing “tomahawk chop” gestures ― what they proudly call “The Chop” ― and chants that echo throughout the stands, as they did during last year’s playoffs broadcast to millions of people. This contrast ― one franchise changing its name and logo and another banking on it all the way to the center stage of professional baseball ― raises a question: Why does this practice of naming teams after Indigenous people and mocking their traditions continue well into the 21st century, even in the face of direct criticism that they are racist and offensive, as asserted by such organizations as the National Congress of American Indians? A major reason is that, despite notable success in the effort to end this practice, a good portion of the American public does not see Indigenous people as their contemporaries, as people who live in and around them. For many fans, there are not enough Indigenous people around to offend, and in fact, according to many fans and team owners, these names actually ‘honor’ Indigenous people. When fans and owners say their team’s name honors Indigenous people, one could ask: Well, why not “honor” other racial or ethnic minorities to this same degree and extent? What makes Indigenous people so worthy? The answer is that the so-called honor here is meant for people deemed to no longer exist as relevant people, to be long since dead. Through this colonialist logic, “honoring” means Indigenous people are rendered as the ghosts of a primitive past, noble savages who could not survive the U.S. “manifest destiny” and its civilizational expansion, although they put up a good fight, like “braves” “warriors” and “chiefs” do. This is about more than racism. It is the logic of genocide, and this is what these names, logos, chops and chants reinforce: the elimination of Indigenous people from these lands, lands that now belong to the United States. The claim of racism thus does not go far enough. The truth is, many fans of high school, college and professional teams who claim that their team’s name honors Indigenous people really do believe it. This belief is a product of U.S. national memory, according to which Indigenous people and the U.S. nation’s colonial practices are consigned to the past, a past out of which are made legends in the form of cowboy-and-Indian movies and in naming teams after, well, Cowboys and Indians, or Redskins, or Braves, or Chiefs, or fill in the blank of the name of your local team, or consumer product, or town, city or state. This is the settler aspect of U.S. national memory, settler memory, in which reminders of the history of Indigenous people and colonialism on these lands are everywhere, just as is the accompanying belief that Indigenous people’s lives today are not relevant; they are nowhere except on our favorite sports jersey, or automobile, or military hardware or town name. It is certainly true that these names and images are offensive and denigrating, but there is a reason why they are primarily targeted at Indigenous people and not as much at other groups who experience racism in the United States. These names are popular because they are premised on the elimination, the nonexistence, of Indigenous people. They reinforce a genocidal logic and in their own way celebrate, under the banner of “honoring,” colonial conquest and violence toward Indigenous people and the theft of their land. In this regard, consider the historical context of the creation of these two MLB names, one triumphant, the other defunct. The Boston Braves got their name in 1912 and eventually relocated to Milwaukee and then to Atlanta, and the Cleveland Indians took on their name in 1915. It is not a coincidence that these and other names (such as the Chicago Blackhawks in 1926 and the now-defunct Washington Redskins in 1933) emerged during the early 20th century. This was a period in which the recorded population of Indigenous people was at its low point (248,000, according to the 1890 U.S. census) and the U.S. effort to take land from Indigenous nations was moving at a rapid pace. The period from 1887 to 1934 is known as the Allotment Era, named after the General Allotment Act of 1887. The Allotment Act was a federal policy created to break up Indigenous tribal reservations (and destroy Indigenous tribes and nations themselves) by allotting individual parcels of land provisionally to some Indigenous people to assimilate them as private-property-holding U.S. citizens, and sell off the rest of their lands to non-Indigenous purchasers, primarily white settlers. From the U.S. perspective, the implementation of the Allotment Act was very successful. By 1934, it turned 90 million acres of Indigenous collective territory into settler-owned private property – 90 million acres! So, this is the context: At the exact period when Indigenous people seem to be disappearing and so much of their land is being taken over by the United States, the practice of naming sports teams after Indigenous people suddenly becomes very popular, spreading across the nation. As Indigenous people and their land, in their concrete existence, move to the margins of U.S. society (out of sight, out of mind, already consigned to the past), the symbolic power of Indian identity in all its caricatured forms moves increasingly to the center of U.S. popular culture, as more and more white Americans cannot wait to ”play Indian.” It is important to put this practice into historical context to understand that names such as the Braves are not just offensive; they are steeped in the blood of genocide and land theft of U.S. colonization that is not consigned to the past; it shapes and continues to the present. Today, the Indigenous population across these lands numbers in the millions of people, with hundreds of Indigenous nations and many political movements fighting for their sovereignty and land rights, and against pipelines, state repression and violence ― from Standing Rock to Mauna Kea, to demanding #LandBack and addressing the violence and traumatic legacy of Indian boarding schools and raising awareness about the thousands of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls across Turtle Island (so-called U.S. and Canada). These Indigenous movements are growing and deserve the support of non-Indigenous people, but efforts to build awareness and alliances are made more challenging when a popular view in U.S. culture is that Indigenous people should be honored for their legendary past but have no functional role in the present. They serve quite well as symbols for cheering on a team in the World Series, but not so much as people to collaborate with to make this a better world. If you cannot see a people for who they are right now, how can you stand with them and take their claims seriously? These team names and representations honor genocide by another name and help blind us to the reality and complexity of contemporary Indigenous people’s lives and politics. Those of us who are not Indigenous must now step up to the plate and refuse this settler memory, as uncomfortable as it may make us. If we do not, the chants will continue and get even louder as fans “honor” this nation’s genocidal history through their sports teams and drown out the calls by Indigenous people for justice today.

I hate that Sunday was a violent display of opulence. I hate that no one cared. I hate that everyone cared. I hate that I watched it, and then watched it again, and then slowed it down because I couldn’t believe that it’d happened. I hate that I joined the voices on social media. I hate that my first response was to joke about it. And as much as I hate the hate that hate created, I hate us. All of us. I hate everything. I hate Chris Rock and his underwhelming, highly offensive joke. I hate Will Smith for dragging us into this. I hate everyone’s hot take except for this one. I hate hot takes. I refused to write a hot take because I knew everyone was going to have a hot take. This is not a hot take. It’s a hate take. I hate the images. I hate the conversations. I hate the academy. I hate Roman Polanski. I hate the misdirection tweets — you know, the ones that start talking about Sunday only to remind us that Antarctica is melting or that Ukraine is at war with Russia. I hate that we can multitask. So we never forget that Antarctica is melting or that the people of Ukraine are suffering. But mostly, I hate the celebrities that have joined teams. Team Will or Team Chris. I hate teams. I hate Amy Schumer and her Karen-esque response. I hate that it involved her “being triggered” and “traumatized” or something days after. I hate how this had nothing to do with her, and yet, here we are. I hate that this was an actual televised Black-on-Black crime. I hate that white people now feel comfortable speaking about Black folks’ business. I hate Diddy for lying. I hate that Amanda Seales tweeted this, and then was called out for this. I hate that at one point I thought Tom Segura was a funny comedian, and then Sunday happened and he felt real comfortable calling Jada Pinkett-Smith a “bald-headed bitch.” I hate that Black women never feel protected. I hate that they have to put up with this. I hate that being starved for protection made some feel like Sunday was called for. It was not, and I hate that for Black women. I hate Joe Rogan. He’s got nothing to do with this, but I hate him, too. Wait, yes he does because he had a hot take and I didn’t read it but I’m sure I hate it. I hate Red Table Talks. We are probably going to have a Red Table Talk. We are definitely going to have a Red Table Talk. I hate that for us. I hate the access we have to celebrities. I hate that they can send out whatever they feel in real time. I hate that Sunday happened and now, I hate Zoe Kravitz. I hate that Black Twitter had CVS receipts for the entire Kravitz family.

I hate Sophia Bush. Who on earth is Sophia Bush? I don’t know, but I hate her. I hate that everyone is a tough guy, or a psychologist, or a cop, or an apologist. There’s only one celeb who gets me, and that’s Daniel Radcliffe (aka Harry Potter), who — much like me — hates all these celebs and their crappy takes too. I once loved the openness of the Smith family. Now I hate it. I hate entanglements, both as a word and as a song. I don’t hate August Alsina. I hate that he came to the Smiths for help. I hate that Jada took advantage of that situation. I hate that we don’t talk about that. I hate that Red Table Talk. The one where Will Smith cried. I hate that everyone made fun of him for it.

12,OPINION: I'm Not Really Afraid Of Anti-Asian Hate And Racism. I'm Enraged.,opinion," I stared incredulously at the photo of GuiYing Ma in the hospital after she was bashed over the head with a large rock. There must be something wrong with this picture, I thought, because the right quadrant of her head was missing, almost as if it had melted — like a Dali. Surreal. My disbelief converted to ire when I saw my mother and ajummas in Ma’s beautiful white hair and wise wrinkles. I held my breath as I read of Christina Yuna Lee’s murder. Oh, no, not again, I thought. My consternation gave way to fury as I imagined my daughter walking to the train every morning, just a few short blocks from where Christina was killed. In the wake of the recent torrent of anti-Asian violence, many of us Asian New Yorkers are afraid. But the emotion that rises in me is not crippling fear; it is un-fucking-adulterated rage. Of course, I am not immune to the fear. Like all women, I live with the deeply internalized, incessant, insidious fear of assault. To paraphrase Margaret Atwood, “Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them.” Further, I am a petite Asian woman careening through middle age. Like many of my city sisters, I have developed hyper-peripheral vision. I don’t listen to music loudly on my headphones, and at night, I avoid desolate streets and watch the shadows of those behind me elongate on the sidewalk when streetlamps grant me the rearview. That said, 27 years of Shaolin Kung Fu training has resulted in my reflexes, physical awareness and instincts being sharper and more potent. Furthermore, to many, I appear like a man and am less likely to be targeted. Asian women make up almost 62% of the victims of reported attacks on our community, according to a study conducted by Stop AAPI Hate. It’s been just over a year since eight people were shot and killed in the Atlanta area — six of them Asian women. I still remember how my voice trembled with tears as I read out the names of the six Asian women who were murdered. My anguish morphed into anger when it was suggested that the murders were not racially motivated. I and my sisters knew better. As of last spring, 81% of Asian adults surveyed by Pew Research Center said they believed violence against us is on the rise. According to NBC News, anti-Asian crime was up 339% in 2021 from 2020. And we should assume the numbers are far greater, as many crimes go unreported. Indubitably, the rise in violence against us was brought on by the abhorrent racist rhetoric around the coronavirus that granted gleeful permission for people to act out their racist fantasies against us. Remember the U.K. variant? Were people with British accents targeted? Hell fucking no! But don’t get it twisted; Asians have faced racism and violence from the gate. As is the case with so many marginalized populations, the hatred is codified into law, thus undergirding the othering and fear of us — from the Page Act of 1875 to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. Then there’s the MSG that enhances the hate recipe: the model minority myth, which gives everyone the impression that we’re all doing Gucci — taking their kids’ spots in the best schools, getting the top jobs, making the fattest checks. But not so fast, cowboy. In New York, almost 1 in 4 of us live below the poverty line. The model minority myth is particularly draconian because it pits yellow against Black. You know; divide and conquer. When the crimes started accumulating, many of the images I saw were of folx of color, particularly Black people, perpetrating the attacks. As it turns out, Janelle Wong, professor of American Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park, found that 75% of the crimes had been committed by white people. I believe that there have been perpetrators of color, and I do think that anti-Blackness, particularly in my community, accepted this narrative with a degree of facility. I can hold two truths simultaneously. I have long thought that one of my responsibilities is to bridge communities. As the first Asian woman in hip-hop who managed Ol’ Dirty Bastard (RIP), RZA, and GZA of Wu-Tang Clan, then introduced them to a real-live Shaolin monk who would become my partner, I believe I have done a small part to create cross-cultural alliances. I was a fan of hip-hop when I moved to New York in ’87, but it was the community that embraced me. Though I point to government policies as enforcers of anti-Asianness, I can’t ignore the deleterious impact that the media has had on our safety. The eroticization, exoticization and fetishization of Asian women in this country ― aided and abetted by the largely white male leer of Hollywood — has surely exacerbated the attacks. When the Atlanta massage parlor murders occurred last March, there was a question as to whether or not they were racially motivated. I don’t believe that every assault against a marginalized person is a hate crime, but this was crystal fucking clear to me. In America, Asian women are sexually reduced to the extremes of two stereotypes: the submissive geisha or the dominating dragon lady. There’s nothing wrong whatsoever if we are one or the other or both. My issue is that we are not allowed to be self-determining and self-defining. Many Asian women have been courted with such dulcet phrases as “Me love you long time” and “Is your pussy sideways?” I don’t even know what the fuck that means. Aren’t all pussies sideways?! And if one more white boy tells me he had an insert-Asian nationality-here girlfriend, that he speaks insert-Asian-language-here, or that he studied insert-Asian-martial-art-here, I will summon all the Han of my Korean ancestors and asphyxiate him with red hot dukbokki. When I was writing my memoir, “The Baddest Bitch In The Room,” my very smart brother Heesok Chang said, “Sophia, what you’re doing with your book is simply asking the world to imagine that you exist.” And here is my exhortation to America: Open up your myopic, microscopic vision of us and let us all in, and grant us the grace of being whatever the fuck we want — even angry.

13,OPINION: The Oscars Still Don’t Know How to Judge Black Movies,opinion," A philosopher of race teaching in the Bible Belt. Oscar season is upon us. On Sunday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will honor what it deems to be the best films of 2021 during the 94th Academy Awards. After years of chastising the academy with the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, this year we have a whopping four Black acting nominees ― Will Smith (“King Richard”) and Denzel Washington (“The Tragedy of Macbeth”) for best actor, and Ariana DeBose (“West Side Story”) and Aunjanue Ellis (“King Richard”) for best supporting actress ― and one film with a predominantly Black cast nominated for best picture (“King Richard”)! Can you sense my sarcasm? I’ve learned to temper my enthusiasm about Black folks winning Academy Awards. I have learned that the Oscars either don’t care for Black art or simply don’t know how to judge Black work. Still, either way, I’ve learned what the Oscars have taught me: Black movies and those who work on them won’t be recognized for their contributions to the art, all the while knowing that winning one can set a filmmaker or actor up for life. Let’s look at what can happen to an actor after winning one of the coveted awards. To win an actual Oscar, the actor doesn’t get anything. The statuette costs about $400 to make, and selling an Oscar in an auction will net you not much more than that. Yet, what can happen to a career is substantial. Money Nation estimated that an actor could get a boost of up to 60% on their average salary after winning one. For example, Brad Pitt did not get much of a bump after he won best supporting actor for “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” but Halle Berry, who was Black famous in 2002 (but not yet famous-famous) when she won for lead actress in “Monster’s Ball,” went from an average salary of $118,750 before her magical night to $6.5 million after. This means that winning an Oscar puts you in a very exclusive club. You make more money, your fame skyrockets and your projects can get easier to make. The streets of Hollywood are littered with pages of screenplays that never saw the light of day because the people who wanted to produce them could not get funding. Winning an Oscar can help with all that. Yet, there are not many people of color in the club. The fact that after hundreds of thousands of movies have included Black actors, only 20 Black actors have won an Academy Award. Though winning the coveted Oscar is often considered the high mark of one’s career, there are many examples of when the academy failed to recognize the best film made in a given year or even the best actor nominated. I will never forgive the academy for failing to nominate “Do the Right Thing” for best picture. That year, the Oscar went to “Driving Miss Daisy.” (Ugh.) And who could forget the year that Al Pacino won for “Scent of a Woman” over the transfixing Denzel Washington as “Malcolm X”? Further, the Oscars have a history of recognizing films like “Green Book,” “The Blind Side” and “The Help” that place white people as the moral center of the stories, which are actually about Black people. I have also grown wary of placing too much weight on the white assessment of Black expression. As we have learned in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement (that was not just actively calling attention to the killing of Black folk by the police but also advocating for Black self-actualization), when we need the approval and validation of the dominant group for us to see our work as valuable, we engage in a vicious form of internalized racism — one that centers whiteness even as we engage in the subversive work of expressing Black brilliance. We are consistently outraged when white institutions do what they were created to do: marginalize people of color. That is what artistic institutions like this have always done. Never forget that the Oscars didn’t recognize Denzel Washington’s brilliance until he played a dirty cop in “Training Day,” for which he won for best lead actor. Put simply, I don’t trust the Oscars to celebrate Black art. There will always be a preference given to white directors, white writers, white actors and white artisans. I would have no problem if the playing field were level, but an actor like Will Smith (who will most likely win for lead actor this year) or Viola Davis (who should have won for lead actress last year for “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”) has to give outstanding performances to be recognized, while all that people like Daniel Day-Lewis or Meryl Streep need to do is yawn in a movie and the academy will trip over itself to nominate them. Even last year, when the Oscars tried to set Chadwick Boseman up for the win, the voters got it wrong and gave it to Anthony Hopkins. That year, the Oscars closed the show with the lead actor award. They usually end with the best picture. Everyone assumed that was because the Oscar would be awarded posthumously to Boseman for his performance in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.” Even Hopkins took a moment to acknowledge Boseman in a video shared on his social media accounts a day after the award show. “At 83 years of age, I did not expect to get this award. I really didn’t,” Hopkins said. “I’m very grateful to the Academy. Thank you. I want to pay tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who was taken from us far too early. And again, thank you all very much. I really did not expect this, so I feel very privileged and honored, thank you.” As we learned from the #OscarsSoWhite campaign, there have historically been significant issues about the voting body that decides Oscar winners. A 2012 Los Angeles Times report let America in on an open secret: 94% of Oscar voters at that time were white, and 77% of them were male. They have since changed that and invited more than 600 new members to join their ranks. This means there are more people of color (in 2020, the percentage was 84% white and 16% minority), but things are far from fixed. With this in mind, I don’t trust the Oscars to get it right when it comes to honoring Black films. I am reminded of the words W.E.B. Du Bois reportedly wrote to eulogize Carter G. Woodson, the great African American scientist: “No white university ever recognized his work; no white scientific society ever honored him. Perhaps this was his greatest honor.” It’s nice to be recognized, but if white institutions fail to appreciate the work of Black folks, we should not be outraged. We should consider it an honor.

14,Opinion: Ketanji Brown Jackson's Confirmation Hearing Was Boring. That's What Happens With A Flawless Nominee.,opinion," Opinion Editor I’m genuinely disappointed in Republicans. The cesspool of bigotry, sexism and racism that makes up much of the Republican half of the Senate has not had one gotcha moment during the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Black woman. There has not been one apparent outburst of crazy, not one shouting match, not one made-for-TV moment where the unshakeable tinfoil hat of Republicanism has been on full display. And I originally expected more of Republicans because they are the conspiracy theorists who keep America lively. They are the ones who claimed that former President Barack Obama was not an actual citizen. And even though Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi doesn’t drink, that didn’t stop North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn from claiming that she has an issue with alcohol. Because who needs facts when you have Republicans. Amirite? With Jackson, they’ve tried to attack her sentencing practices in which she favors rehabilitation, (mock gasp) empathy, and jail time. They presented baseless claims taken entirely out of context to imply that Jackson, both a woman and a mother, is soft on child porn offenders. But Republicans have their own explanation for their lackluster performance, that they are allegedly taking the high road. I know, but that’s what they are saying. Republicans have claimed that, unlike Democrats, they wouldn’t be using the personal attack approach on Jackson as their counterparts did when questioning Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on his alleged history of sexual assault, rampant bro-ism and beer drinking. Of course, Sen. Lindsey Graham tried it, but he got upset and stormed out because Graham tends to get upset easily. (In our house, we call temper tantrums “Grahaming.”) “So you say, Judge Jackson, you don’t have any judicial philosophy per se. Well, somebody on the left believes you do, or they went and spent the money to have you in this chair,” Graham said, alluding to conspiracy theories around dark-money groups backing Jackson’s nomination, the Greenville News reports. “The media will be your biggest cheerleader. They’re in your camp. They have every right to pick who they want to pick. There won’t be this constant attack on you like Judge Kavanaugh and other conservative judicial appointments,” Graham said while Grahaming. “There won’t be any questioning of where you go to church. What kind of groups you’re in in church, how you decide to raise your kids, what you believe in, how you believe in God, nobody’s gonna do that,” Graham said to Jackson. “And that’s a good thing. So you’re the beneficiary of a lot. You’re the beneficiary of Republican nominees having their life turned upside down, and it didn’t work.” If you’ve been watching the three-day yawnfest that is Jackson’s confirmation hearing, you know that there’s been a lot of this GOP rabble-rousing to excite the base, but no actual questions lobbed at Jackson. Just random statements made because no one loves a microphone and a captive audience like Republicans. Here’s a thought: Maybe, just maybe, Republicans could not have their gotcha moment because Ketanji Brown Jackson is flawless. Jackson attended Harvard University for college and law school. She was the editor of the Harvard Law Review. She had three clerkships, including one with Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. She was a U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia. And, since 2016, she has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers. She is literally the collective Obama administration during his eight years in office, where the best Republicans could do was rage about his wearing of a tan suit. She’s so untouchable that the “always ready to turn a committee hearing into an episode of ‘Jerry Springer’” GOP has not had a chance. This hearing for the most significant court in the land, this hearing to confirm the first Black female Supreme Court justice in the history of ever has been, dare I say it, boring. And that might be because Jackson crushed it in her opening statements noting that she is both the American dream and her African name: Ketanji Onyika, which she told the panel means “lovely one.” But none of this could stop Sen. Ted Cruz, who spent the majority of his time Tuesday trying to link Jackson to critical race theory — which argues that race has played a part in public policy — because she’s on the board of trustees for Georgetown Day School, which teaches books that Cruz doesn’t like. It didn’t matter that Jackson explained that “she was drawn to the school because it was founded to provide a racially integrated education at a time when Washington, D.C.’s public schools were segregated.” Nope. Cruz continued his vaguely racial line of questioning to imply that Jackson is connected to CRT because the school teaches books by Boston University historian and National Book Award-winning author Ibram X. Kendi. Jackson merely stated that CRT isn’t something she “studied or relied” on as a judge. And just like that Cruz’s gotcha moment, if you can even call it that, fizzled out. Maybe it was the voice of reason, perhaps it was the lone Black Republican, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who pulled the ear of the Republican Party, but the reality is Republicans know that the optics of them being their usual despicable selves against a Black woman with stellar bona fides would’ve looked bad for business. This is the one time that the fear of being called racist actually stopped would-be racists from being racist. Or maybe they have a highly qualified woman with values and excellence at her disposal whom they couldn’t tear down and figured that trying would be useless. Whatever their reasoning, who cares as Jackson is set to be confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the highest court in all the land, which burns Republicans whether or not they can actually say it. And you love to see it. Opinion Editor"
15,OPINION: So You Don’t Want To Defund The Police? Here’s Why You Should Fund Public Defense.,opinion," Whether police admit it or not, their profession is on fire. They are increasingly tasked with jobs that fall outside their area of competence, from domestic violence response to crisis de-escalation to mental health first aid. And more police spending hasn’t paid the dividend of reduced crime. Police officers in the U.S. have also proved to be dramatically more lethal than those in any other nation, killing more than a thousand civilians last year. Police violence echoes other deeply American forms of inequity against Black and brown people. The additional harm done through racial profiling, stop-and-frisk, racialized community surveillance and criminalizing children is difficult to quantify and exists at a near-universal scale. Still, detractors of reform on the right and left are threatening Americans with escalating unrest if we dare to modernize our philosophy on public safety. Their emotional appeals and skewed data points are working, with mainstream media parroting lies that efforts to defund the police unleashed the wave of crime we’re seeing reported across the country. In reality, we didn’t defund the police, and any uptick in crime is more likely the result of intersecting unprecedented phenomena, including our nation’s mental health crisis, a crumbling democracy, deepening political polarization, nationwide school disruptions, rampant homelessness and wealth inequality. Yet, falsehoods about reform are continually bandied about by political opportunists as the singular reason for people’s unchecked malfeasance. In New York, where everyone lives in a constant state of pandemic-fueled whiplash, fearmongers are perfidiously warning people that Alvin Bragg, Manhattan’s new district attorney, will marshal the city into an era of crime and chaos given his pledge to seek jail or prison time for only the most serious crimes, unless the law requires otherwise. As D.A. Bragg has detailed repeatedly in laying out his evidence-based policies, the data doesn’t support these litanies of fear, yet this catastrophist perspective persists. The good news is that, even in this time of tremendous uncertainty and division, there are still a few areas in which we can find consensus. Wherever you come from or whatever your background, we all want safety, opportunity, economic mobility, liberty, joy and prosperity in our communities. After more than a decade of working in American criminal law, I know public defenders can help make this vision our reality. My career has spanned two states and more than 2,000 clients. I’ve worked inside the Los Angeles County Public Defender Office, the Santa Clara County Public Defender Office in California and the Bronx Defenders in New York City. I’ve tried criminal cases, resolved family and civil matters, and won release for people sentenced to life in prison. My experience has been varied, but helping systematically disenfranchised populations has always been central. To that end, I can say confidently that public defenders occupy a uniquely powerful position in our legal system. “The time between arrest and the end of the court case is valuable time when clients could be getting better,” explains Tracie Olsen, chief public defender in Yolo County, California. “Public defenders are perfectly situated to assist clients during this time, but only if we’re funded properly.” Situated early in the legal process, public defenders have immediate, confidential access to the people most at risk of both causing harm and being harmed. They are automatically assigned, thereby eliminating barriers to entry that might separate a person in crisis from available services. And, unlike any other public safety resource, they have the power to create tailored solutions for their clients, using restorative means rather than imprisonment. Since jails actually make future crime more likely and cause immeasurable harm to those detained within them, this method of restoring opportunity rather than destroying potential seems both rational and effective. “When clients are arrested, they often need help with more than just their legal needs. They need help obtaining medications, finding shelter, locating a mental health counselor, entering treatment for addiction issues, or with transportation to get to court,” Olsen says. “When clients’ needs are met, they stop committing crime and stay out of jail. It’s just that simple.” Thanks to my tenure with the Bronx Defenders, a legendary organization that supports a client’s entire personhood — their job, housing, family, health and unique human value — I was always able to work beyond the penal code as an attorney. The Defenders’ commitment to holistic defense showed me that a good lawyer prevents incarceration but a great lawyer gives people the tools to never be ensnared by that system again. My experience reflects the research. A recent rigorous evaluation by the Harvard Law Review found that holistic defense reduces the likelihood of a jail or prison sentence by 16% and expected sentence length by 24%. Over the 10-year study period, holistic defense in the Bronx resulted in nearly 1.1 million fewer days of punishment in a cage. Collaborative forms of defense are a simple solution that should be a public policy no-brainer. But it can be difficult to implement for jurisdictions unaccustomed to mixing services inside defense agencies. In an effort to ensure that every person in America can one day access the kind of wraparound defender we know saves money and creates better outcomes, I left trial work to start Partners for Justice, a program to help every defender transform into a collaborative service hub. By embedding specially trained advocates inside existing public defenders offices, we close the revolving door between arrest and incarceration, eliminating the need to pay for more than 150 years in jail, with upwards of 30,000 jail days cut from January to August 2021 alone. “When I got out, me and my mom were basically on our own trying to figure out how to do Social Security, food stamps, etc.,” says Jason M., a client of Partners for Justice advocate Eliana Swerdlow. “[Eliana got] anything that I needed, really. Health insurance, medication, even getting clothes and whatnot, steering me through all the paperwork that would’ve took me months. [Eliana] had it done in a day.” Partners for Justice has connected thousands of people to social services and achieved about 80% of our service goals, like getting people access to health care, benefits or employment. “And it’s such a difference to where all these things aren’t weighing on me no more,” Jason adds. “It’s a fresh start. And then you got this team of people behind you, so you don’t want to let them down either.” I mention Jason M. to demonstrate how much our local governments could save if they chose to resource public defenders while they engage in the longer conversation about the transformation of other public safety agencies. In some communities, a single public defender has had to handle upward of 19,000 misdemeanor cases annually. Crushing caseloads means defenders are unable to provide non-legal aid, as Eliana did for Jason ― a lost opportunity to build trust and ensure the client walks the right path. When asked about how it feels to get services through parole, Jason describes that lack of trust: “You’re just hoping [the parole officer] doesn’t throw you in jail, you know? But when you’re dealing with somebody who’s not in a power position above you but instead is coaxing you along and helping you,” he says of Eliana, “it takes your mind and puts it in a positive area rather than being in your negative, everything’s-against-me, I don’t know what’s going on, I’m lost. It takes it and switches it to where now I’m on an even playing field, and I feel confident because I trust this person.” On a macro level, our model at Partners for Justice makes economic and public safety sense. It can save taxpayer dollars through reduced use of jails and provides people with the tools and opportunities needed to thrive. It’s a public policy unicorn: a path to ending mass incarceration with no negative impact on public safety. On a micro level, every one of those thousands of people we serve is a human life whose course has been, we hope, transformed by our help in accessing the tools they needed to succeed: A woman who resorted to stealing because of an ongoing crisis involving housing and her husband’s need for mental health care. A man about to lose his housing because he couldn’t read an eviction notice. A young man whose mental health crisis might have resulted in jail time had a public defense advocate not intervened to create better options. Or Jason, who shared, “Normally when I get out, I’m completely lost.... It’s an uphill climb just to get to normal.... When you have something like this to fall back on, it’s an unbelievable resource.... I’ve never experienced nothing like this. Coming out of jail, you’re on your own, you know?” When every case is a human story, making investments in public defense is so much more than just a sensible budget choice. As we seek a better, safer and more prosperous future, investing in those who are most ready to make tangible, transformative change now — our public defenders — is a good choice for all of us, regardless of our ideology.

16,"Opinion: The Humanity of Naomi Osaka, Michael Beasley And Other Black Athletes Versus The Inhumanity Of Their 'Fans'",opinion," Opinion Editor Therefore, to state it in another, more accurate way, I became, during my fourteenth year, for the first time in my life, afraid — afraid of the evil within me and afraid of the evil without. — James Baldwin Where does a giant go when he doesn’t want to be seen? For six-foot-ten-inch former NBA player Michael Beasley, he stays in his house. With his thoughts. The ones that haunt him. The little thoughts he should be past, teaming up with larger ones that he can’t shake. Inside him, they create a dormant volcano, because that’s what trauma does to many of us who have survived the neighborhood and all of the temptations that come with it; we still walk around with the bubbling hot lava of trauma just waiting to erupt. “The only people that haven’t stolen from me are my kids,” he says in an interview on “The Pivot Podcast,” hosted by Ryan Clark, Channing Crowder, and Fred Taylor — all former NFL players. No one told him how to handle the volcano inside him. No one showed him that it could be contained and, eventually, with therapy, extinguished. And Beasley is hot. Not with anger, but with sadness. Same thing, really. Beasley’s heard everything that fans and critics have had to say about him. All of it has landed in space that even Beasley doesn’t know. So he hides. Maybe from us, maybe for us. But either way, he’s isolating himself so that he doesn’t have to be the butt of jokes that aren’t funny or relive all of the ways people believe he ruined his life. I’m not listing all of the run-ins Beasley’s had with authority figures, you can read that here, but I will ask this: What is a reasonable expectation of maturity when no one has taught you how to be mature? So, Beasley, 31, stays home. Like a child on punishment. But the other men in the room, all Black men, recognize the isolation. They are concerned that this might be the warning signs of something else. “You’ve have kids, I have kids. Come to my house,” Crowder said on the podcast. “We can get bounce houses for the kids, and we can drink a couple beers and hang out.” Crowder paused and then added: “That’s not a normal successful man’s life; to sit up in the house like that.” But this is what happens to Black athletes in an environment where fans feel entitled to them and spectators are cruel. They say “have a thicker skin,” that the millions they make should be the salve on their wounds, reducing Black athletes to silent giants, denied their humanity, who have to prove their toughness by how well they can take abuse. And that’s what it is — abuse. That’s why the efforts of those like tennis player Naomi Osaka and superstar gymnast Simone Biles to bring awareness to athletes’ mental health are so important. It’s why the hosts of “Pivot” offered to be a friend to Beasley and encouraged him to get out of the house. It’s why we all need to take mental health in the workplace seriously. According to Mental Health America, Black people make up 13.4% of the United States. Of that, some 16% have reported having a mental illness. And while that number might seem small, that is over 7 million people, or more than the combined population of Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia. The more important study, though, might be the one that found that 63% of ”Black people believe that a mental health condition is a sign of personal weakness. As a result, people may experience shame about having a mental illness and worry that they may be discriminated against due to their condition.” The stigma surrounding therapy and the widely held belief among many Black people that churches or other places of worship are the only acceptable forms of mental health treatment, coupled with widely held assumptions about Black athletes, could’ve led to those unceremonious moments in sports where the heckling fan and the sports player collide. Take the Malice in the Palace, the infamous brawl between the Detroit Pistons and the Indiana Pacers and unruly fans on Nov. 19, 2004 — and before you make that face, remember that we’ve learned that Pistons center Ben Wallace’s mom had just died, and the Pacers’ Ron Artest, who would later change his name to Metta World Peace, has been vocal about his struggles with mental health. And don’t forget that the brawl between players and fans happened after a drink was thrown on Artest as he lay on the scorer’s table. What ensued was an all-out fracas. It was a black eye on the sport, but what was more telling after the fact was the players believing that they were going to die that night thanks to a lack of police presence and an out-of-control Detroit crowd, only to be suspended and called “thugs.” No one mentions that Pacers center Jermaine O’Neal got his suspension overturned because he took the NBA to court and a federal judge found that he had a right to protect himself. Truthfully, Artest and Wallace probably shouldn’t have been on the court that night. Wallace was emotionally raw from the loss of his mother and Artest had struggled with his mental health for years and was merely labeled a hothead. This is the struggle of mental health for Black athletes who survived the ghetto when money isn’t enough. This is the struggle for Black athletes who can be both revered and despised in a country that doesn’t love them back. This will always be the struggle for Black athletes who have to work out a Rubik’s cube-like contraption inside themselves to make sense of all the ways they will be treated and how they should present and behave. Just imagine all the levels of WTF that recently took place inside Serena and Venus Williams’ heads as they listened to director Jane Campion drag them during the Critics’ Choice Awards. “Serena and Venus, you are such marvels. However, you don’t play against the guys, like I have to,” Campion said. Just watch Venus’ face — it says it all. Here's the clip of Jane Campion's speech#CriticsChoiceAwards pic.twitter.com/pucAsmE2JF It’s this level of internalized contortionism that becomes exhausting for most Black athletes. In 2021, Naomi Osaka was one of the top tennis players in the world when she left the game to take care of her mental health. She literally quit the French Open and took care of herself. At the time, everyone seemed supportive. That was until Saturday when a heckler yelled, “Naomi you suck!” during a silent moment in her match against Russia’s Veronika Kudermetova. A visibly shaken Osaka went on to lose the match 6-0, 6-4. After the game, Osaka addressed the crowd. “Hi,” Osaka said. “I just wanted to say thank you. I feel like I cried enough on camera. To be honest, I’ve gotten heckled before and it didn’t really bother me. But heckled here. ... I’ve watched a video of Serena and Venus getting heckled here and if you’ve never watched it, you should watch.” She continued: “I don’t know why but it went into my head and got replayed a lot. I’m trying not to cry but, I just wanted to say thank you and congratulations [Veronika]. Thank you.” Osaka wasn’t trying to overshadow Kudermetova’s victory; she was telling the heckler that if you wanted to hurt me, you did. And that’s the part that hurt the worst. Osaka is performing under intense scrutiny during a vulnerable time, and in a professional sport where the biblical ethos is to “suck it up.” I couldn’t imagine the difficulty that Osaka faces being a Black woman in pro tennis, in a country that doesn’t care about Black women. But I do know that it’s time for spectators to spectate. It’s also time for those athletes who believe that heckling is a part of the game to work to change it. It’s time that paid attendees realize that just because athletes are performing in front of you doesn’t mean that you own them. And you might want to take into account all that they may be going through, I mean just because they are giants doesn’t mean they don’t have feelings too. Opinion Editor"
