0,What Are Uterine Fibroids? Symptoms And Risk Factors You Should Know.,health," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life Tanika Gray Valbrun started experiencing extremely heavy periods early in her teen years. “I was that girl who always had to carry pads with her, felt like I was always on my period, had to wear two panties and biker shorts, always had an extra bag with me,” she told HuffPost. In addition to the heavy bleeding, Valbrun also experienced painful periods, her abdomen protruded and she felt a constant need to use the bathroom. It wasn’t until she was about 25 that she received a diagnosis: uterine fibroids. Many doctors appointments and treatments followed, and though she is still on this medical journey, the source of her issues is no longer a mystery. Although fibroids are quite common, they remain relatively unknown or misunderstood for many. “Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that grow from smooth muscle cells, so they’re often found in the uterus,” said Dr. Sawsan As-Sanie, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan Medical School. “They can be in the lining of the uterus, the wall of the uterus or on the surface.” Also called leiomyomas or myomas, fibroids vary in shape, size and number. Some grow slowly over many years while others might remain the same size for a long time and then start to grow rapidly. “Looking back, I think about how many times I had accommodated my life for fibroids,” Valbrun said. “I was always strategizing what to bring or how to dress because I would be bleeding. I never wore white clothing, even though I love whites and light colors.” Below, experts break down the facts and misconceptions around uterine fibroids. “Fibroids are highly prevalent, and they become more common as patients get older,” As-Sanie noted. The National Institutes of Health estimates that up to 70% of white women and 80% to 90% of Black women will develop fibroids by the age of 50. “Really, anyone with a uterus can experience uterine fibroids, but they disproportionately impact Black women at a higher rate,” Valbrun said. “Black women are more likely to experience them, and their fibroids are more likely to occur when they’re younger, grow more quickly and cause more symptoms.” Age is a big risk factor with fibroids, as their prevalence increases as patients grow older and then declines in post-menopausal women. Although fibroids are most common in women ages 30 to 40 and in Black women, As-Sanie said that she sees them in patients of all ages, races and ethnicities. “Mine started in my teenage years, so it’s not just an issue for women in their childbearing years,” Valbrun added. “And even though race is a risk factor, it’s not just a Black woman’s disease ― just like endometriosis is not just a white woman’s thing.” There are genetic factors as well. A family history of fibroids is associated with a three times greater risk of developing fibroids compared with women without that history, As-Sanie explained. She noted that obesity and nulliparous (the medical term for having never given birth) can also be factors. Despite their prevalence, fibroids don’t cause symptoms in the majority of people who have them. “Only about a quarter of women who have uterine fibroids have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they end up needing intervention,” As-Sanie said. The most common symptoms are related to menstruation, such as heavy bleeding and pelvic pain. “Any amount of bleeding that interferes with quality of life deserves an evaluation,” As-Sanie noted. “We tell patients if they’re soaking through a pad or tampon more frequently than every one to two hours, that should warrant evaluation. That amount can lead to anemia, low blood counts.” Valbrun said that she’s had to have at least five blood transfusions over the years to address her severe anemia. “I was always craving ice and soap, so much that I would be constantly trying to smell them,” she recalled. “My doctor told me it’s called pica, and it’s what happens when your body is deficient in iron.” In addition to menstrual pain, fibroids can also cause pain during sex and at random times. As Valbrun reported, they may lead to swelling in the uterus and abdomen as well. “Patients can also have what we call ‘bulk symptoms’ ― pressure from fibroids if they get large enough, feelings of bloating, urinary frequency and urgency, and even constipation or other bowel issues,” As-Sanie said. “Fibroids are also associated with pregnancy-related complications like miscarriage and infertility.” “In terms of diagnosis, fibroids are generally diagnosed or at least suspected during a pelvic exam,” As-Sanie said, noting that the uterus often feels enlarged. If fibroids are suspected, then the next step usually involves imaging, commonly with a pelvic ultrasound ― though tests including sonohysterography, hysteroscopy, hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy can also offer information. “Some patients come in reporting symptoms, but for others it might be diagnosed during a routine exam,” As-Sanie noted. “They may have had no clinical symptoms. Or if they’re having trouble becoming pregnant, fibroids may be discovered as they look into their fertility problems.” If you’re diagnosed with uterine fibroids, the next steps depend on your symptoms. You might not need treatment if your fibroids are small and aren’t causing symptoms or if you’re nearing menopause. “If someone’s not having symptoms, we typically just survey them over time,” As-Sanie said. “They should get regular checkups to monitor for development of symptoms if they’re not having them. Often we’ll get repeat imaging every year or couple years to monitor for fibroid growth.” For patients with symptoms, it’s important to examine the symptoms they’re having and what their goals are. “With heavy bleeding, this can often be managed with medications ― like hormonal birth control pills, progestin-only birth control methods, other pills and injections,” As-Sanie said. Although those methods are effective for many patients, they don’t work for others. And over time other interventions might become necessary. Myomectomy is the surgical removal of fibroids, and uterine artery embolization (sometimes called uterine fibroid embolization) is a less-invasive procedure that involves injecting tiny particles into the blood vessels to stop blood flow to the fibroids and cause them to shrink. “There are also different types of ablations where you can use forms of energy to basically burn them away or make them smaller,” Valbrun said. She added that the recovery process after fibroid-related procedures can be lengthy, noting that it took her about eight weeks to recovery from her myomectomy. Some fibroids are too small to be removed, and even after you’ve had fibroids removed or shrunk, there’s always a possibility of regrowth or new ones appearing. And some patients have so many fibroids that it wouldn’t be feasible to remove all of them. As a result, the only total cure is hysterectomy. “The choice of what treatment is appropriate in patients very much depends on both a combination of things, like their age and desire to preserve fertility, as well as fibroid size and location,” As-Sanie said. “Hysterectomy is generally considered a last resort when other things haven’t worked, but it is considered curative and it’s quite common in the U.S. And uterine fibroids and abnormal bleeding are the most common non-cancerous reasons that women have hysterectomies.” “Any symptoms of heavy bleeding and/or pelvic pain that are bothersome enough that they’re interfering with your quality of life warrant evaluation,” As-Sanie said. “There’s no amount of bleeding or pain we would say is automatically ‘normal.’ If you’re not able to work as effectively or enjoy your life, that is by definition considered abnormal and deserves evaluation.” Fibroids are relatively common, but they’re also just one of many potential causes for increased levels of pain and bleeding. It’s important to see a medical professional to help figure out what might be at the root of your problems and determine the best course of treatment. Many experience pregnancy complications or infertility related to fibroids, but medical interventions can help. So if you’re hoping to give birth someday, know that fibroids don’t necessarily prevent that. “For many women who have fibroids but no symptoms, we don’t automatically recommend treatment in order to get pregnant or have a successful or healthy pregnancy,” As-Sanie said. “The relationship between fibroids and fertility and pregnancy is complicated, but there are many women who have fibroids ― even fibroids that cause symptoms ― that can become pregnant and carry a healthy pregnancy without needing intervention.” And remember that there’s nothing shameful about fibroids or any other gynecological issue. “Patients often feel like it’s embarrassing, and their families ― or even physicians they’ve seen ― have dismissed or minimized their pain as being a normal part of a woman’s experience,” As-Sanie said. “This is unfair and unhelpful to women.” She urged patients and medical providers to help break down the stigma around menstrual disorders. “We need to improve awareness and diagnosis, as well as reduce the bias and stigma by talking about pain and bleeding so that young girls and women don’t dismiss it as normal or think it’s too shameful to talk about,” As-Sanie emphasized. “That way they can get earlier diagnoses and treatments.” Valbrun is dedicated to raising awareness and clearing up misconceptions about uterine fibroids. In 2014, she launched The White Dress Project to spread the word, increase funding for medical research and offer support to other people who are living with fibroids. “I want to make people feel like they are not alone,” she said. “And I wanted the support for myself because I never saw any organized walks or runs or people asking me to buy a T-shirt about fibroid awareness. It feels very lonely to feel like you’re the only one on the bathroom floor in the fetal position. You’re the only one canceling on your girlfriends, the only one not spending the night at a guy’s house even though you want to.” The name stems from her desire to reclaim the color white as a symbol of hope and empower herself and others to feel comfortable wearing white ― or to do it anyway in an act of rebellion against the limits fibroids can impose. The White Dress Project hosts community events, offers educational resources, supports research and advocates for policy in support of fibroid awareness. Michigan state Rep. Kyra Harris Bolden (D) has also gotten involved in advocacy after being diagnosed with fibroids in 2020 and undergoing a myomectomy. “It took me seven weeks to get back to what I felt was 100%, but ever since then, I’ve been on this quest to just bring more awareness to fibroids,” she told HuffPost. “After I shared my story on the House floor during Uterine Fibroid Awareness Month, I got an outpouring of messages from women sharing their fibroid experience and how horrific it had been.” Bolden has also partnered with organizations to spread awareness, worked on legislation and even helped get funding allocated for fibroid research in the Michigan state budget. “This condition affects so many women but isn’t widely talked about,” she said. “If I had known it was so common, I probably wouldn’t have waited until my condition got so bad to seek treatment and could’ve had a less invasive surgery.” Valbrun also wants to spread the word about the different treatment options for fibroids. “A lot of times, hysterectomy is the only option offered for women to deal with fibroids,” she said. “Black women are more likely to be offered hysterectomy. I was told to have a hysterectomy when I was 26 and use a surrogate if I wanted children, and it was really disheartening. Fortunately, I found another doctor who told me about my other options.” Of course, many patients are great candidates for a hysterectomy, especially if they are done having children or don’t want to give birth, but Valbrun wants to make sure people feel informed and empowered about this decision rather than pressured. “Remember that you are powerful and have a say,” she said. “Nobody knows your body like you do.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost Life"
1,FDA Hopes To Lick STIs By Authorizing Oral Sex Undies,health," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Chew on this: What if you could experience oral sex without actually taking off your clothes? That prospect is a reality now that the Food and Drug Administration has given clearance to a line of underwear that can prevent sexually transmitted infections from oral sex or analingus, according to BuzzFeed News. FDA clearance means that a manufacturer has shown its product is “substantially equivalent” to a similar product that already has FDA clearance or approval. The product is a brand of thin and stretchy single-use latex panties called Lorals that caters to people who want to feel both pleasure and protection during cunnilingus. The panties are not cleared for fellatio or penetrative sex, however. Company officials had to prove the oral sex undies were at least equivalent to the protection provided by dental dams, a polyurethane barrier method that Los Angeles-area OB-GYN Dr. Sheryl Ross speculates is used by 5% of people at most. “The dental dam is all we have to date for oral sex for women, anal activity, or rimming, and no one is using them,” Ross told BuzzFeed, adding that the Lorals underwear seems to be “a lot sexier.” Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, noted to The New York Times that the product fills a need because “oral sex is not totally risk-free” and many “teenagers are initiating their first sexual activity with oral sex.” She thinks the panties could “reduce anxiety and increase pleasure around that particular behavior.” Although the risk of transmitting HIV from a vagina through oral sex is considered very low, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says infections like herpes, gonorrhea and syphilis can be transmitted through oral sex. In addition, HPV — human papillomavirus — is more easily transmitted that way, and mouth and throat infections from some types of HPV may develop into oral or neck cancer, the agency said. “The FDA’s authorization of this product gives people another option to protect against STIs during oral sex,” Courtney Lias, director of the FDA office that led the review of the underwear, told The New York Times. However, one woman who tested the product had mixed reviews, according to BuzzFeed. The woman told the website that she liked the product’s vanilla scent, which was “strong, but not overwhelming,” as well as the easy-to-follow instructions. But while the woman praised the material for being thin enough “where you can actually feel sensations,” her partner said the latex “did not feel good on his tongue and the friction when licking was uncomfortable.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the underwear had been approved by the FDA, when it actually had received FDA clearance. The two terms refer to different kinds of FDA authorization. Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
2,Madison Cawthorn Wants CDC To Include Abortions In Death Rates,health," Senior Reporter, HuffPost If Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) has his way, abortions would be included in death rates moving forward. On Tuesday, the far-right congressman introduced the Seeking Official Uncounted Lives Statistics Act, or SOULS Act. If passed, the bill would require the Centers for Disease Control and prevention to include “to the extent possible, aborted children in death numbers and rates.” Currently, the CDC tracks abortions separately, via data that states and other areas voluntarily report to the agency. Establishing personhood rights for fetuses has long been a goal of abortion opponents. Reproductive rights advocates warn that doing so would result in pregnant people totally losing control over their own pregnancies and being forced to accept unwanted medical procedures, with “dangerous, even deadly, consequences,” according to a Thursday op-ed in The Washington Post by California State University professor Rebecca Kluchin. Cawthorn’s proposed legislation comes at a time when five Supreme Court justices have reportedly signed on to a draft by Justice Samuel Alito that would overturn Roe v. Wade and could be used to justify contraception bans. Senior Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

3,Joe Biden Co-Hosting 2nd COVID Summit As World's Resolve Falters,health," WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will appeal for a renewed international commitment to attacking COVID-19 as he convenes the second global COVID-19 summit at a time when faltering resolve at home jeopardizes that global response. Eight months after he used the first such summit to announce an ambitious pledge to donate 1.2 billion vaccine doses to the world, the urgency of the U.S. and other nations to respond has waned. Momentum on vaccinations and treatments has faded even as new, more infectious variants rise and billions across the globe remain unprotected. Congress has refused to meet Biden’s request to provide another $22.5 billion in what he has called critically needed aid funding. The White House said Biden will address the opening of the virtual summit Thursday morning with prerecorded remarks and will make the case that addressing COVID-19 “must remain an international priority.” The U.S. is co-hosting the summit along with Germany, Indonesia, Senegal and Belize. The U.S. has shipped nearly 540 million vaccine doses to more than 110 countries and territories, according to the State Department — by far more than any other donor nation. After the delivery of more than 1 billion vaccines to the developing world, the problem is no longer that there aren’t enough shots, but a lack of logistical support to get doses into arms. According to government data, more than 680 million donated vaccine doses have been left unused in developing countries because they were set to expire soon and couldn’t be administered quickly enough. As of March, 32 poorer countries had used fewer than half of the COVID-19 vaccines they were sent. U.S. assistance to promote and facilitate vaccinations overseas dried up earlier this year, and Biden has requested about $5 billion for the effort through the rest of the year. “We have tens of millions of unclaimed doses because countries lack the resources to build out their cold chains, which basically is the refrigeration systems; to fight  disinformation; and to hire vaccinators,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week. She added that the summit is “going to be an opportunity to elevate the fact that we need additional funding to continue to be a part of this effort around the world.” “We’re going to continue to fight for more funding here,” Psaki said. “But we will continue to press other countries to do more to help the world make progress as well.” Congress has balked at the price tag for COVID-19 relief and has thus far refused to take up the package because of political opposition to the impending end of pandemic-era migration restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border. Even after a consensus for virus funding briefly emerged in March, lawmakers decided to strip out the global aid funding and solely focus the assistance on shoring up U.S. supplies of vaccine booster shots and therapeutics. Biden has warned that without Congress acting, the U.S. could lose out on access to the next generation of vaccines and treatments, and that the nation won’t have enough supply of booster doses or the antiviral drug Paxlovid for later this year. He’s also sounding the alarm that more variants will spring up if the U.S. and the world don’t do more to contain the virus globally. “To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,” Biden said last September during the first global summit. ""To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere.""President Joe Biden spoke with world leaders Wednesday and pledged another half-billion vaccines to be sent to low- and middle-income countries around the world. pic.twitter.com/4o9f1q2EBp The virus has killed more than 995,000 people in the U.S. and at least 6.2 million globally, according to figures kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Demand for COVID-19 vaccines has dropped in some countries as infections and deaths have declined globally in recent months, particularly as the omicron variant has proved to be less severe than earlier versions of the disease. For the first time since it was created, the U.N.-backed COVAX effort has “enough supply to enable countries to meet their national vaccination targets,” according to vaccines alliance Gavi CEO Dr. Seth Berkley, which fronts COVAX. Still, despite more than 65% of the world’s population receiving at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, fewer than 16% of people in poor countries have been immunized. It is highly unlikely countries will hit the World Health Organization target of vaccinating 70% of all people by June. In countries including Cameroon, Uganda and the Ivory Coast, officials have struggled to get enough refrigerators to transport vaccines, send enough syringes for mass campaigns and get enough health workers to inject the shots. Experts also point out that more than half of the health workers needed to administer the vaccines in poorer countries are either underpaid or not paid at all. Donating more vaccines, critics say, would miss the point entirely. “It’s like donating a bunch of fire trucks to countries that are on fire, but they have no water,” said Ritu Sharma, a vice president at the charity CARE, which has helped immunize people in more than 30 countries, including India, South Sudan and Bangladesh. “We can’t be giving countries all these vaccines but no way to use them,” she said, adding that the same infrastructure that got the shots administered in the U.S. is now needed elsewhere. “We had to tackle this problem in the U.S., so why are we not now using that knowledge to get vaccines into the people who need them most?” Sharma said greater investment was needed to counter vaccine hesitancy in developing countries where there are entrenched beliefs about the potential dangers of Western-made medicines. “Leaders must agree to pursue a coherent strategy to end the pandemic instead of a fragmented approach that will extend the lifespan of this crisis,” said Gayle Smith, CEO of The ONE Campaign. GAVI’s Berkley also said that countries are increasingly asking for the pricier messenger RNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, which are not as easily available as the AstraZeneca vaccine, which made up the bulk of COVAX’s supply last year. The emergence of variants like delta and omicron have led many countries to switch to mRNA vaccines, which seem to provide more protection and are in greater demand globally than traditionally made vaccines like AstraZeneca, Novavax or those made by China and Russia. ___ Cheng reported from London."
4,Trump Frets Over Underdog Surge In Dr. Oz Senate Race,health," Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost The sudden rise of conservative commentator and author Kathy Barnette in polls has Donald Trump apparently worried about his pick in Pennsylvania’s GOP Senate race, celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz. Following the release of a Fox News poll that showed Barnette within striking distance of Oz, Trump released a statement slamming Barnette as too weak to face the Democrat in the general election. “Kathy Barnette will never be able to win the General Election against the Radical Left Democrats,” Trump said Thursday in a news release from his political action committee. In the same statement, Trump left the door open to supporting her if she wins, an effort to cover his bases in light of increasing scrutiny about the waning power of his political endorsements. “She has many things in her past which have not been properly explained or vetted, but if she is able to do so, she will have a wonderful future in the Republican Party — and I will be behind her all the way,” he said. Barnette, who wrote a book about being Black and conservative and who has never held public office, has a lengthy history of anti-Muslim and anti-gay statements, according to CNN. She falsely accused former President Barack Obama of being a secret Muslim and has suggested banning Islam. She’s also dabbled in fraud conspiracies concerning the 2020 election. The Fox poll from Tuesday showed Barnette with 19% of the vote, just behind Oz at 22% and former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick at 20%. It also had 18% of voters still undecided. National Republicans are choosing to stay out of the fray for now. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is neutral when it comes to the primary. On Thursday, he downplayed concerns about Barnette’s viability as a general election candidate and projected confidence about winning the open seat no matter who comes out on top. “We’ll win Pennsylvania,” Scott told HuffPost. But Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), the vice chair of the Senate GOP conference, defended Barnette by calling her “extraordinary.” “Just because you’re a political newcomer doesn’t mean we write you off,” Ernst said in an interview with CNN. Trump on Thursday also announced a tele-rally for Oz just days after he traveled to the state to hold a MAGA rally for the former “Dr. Oz Show” host — another sign that the former president believes Oz might need his last-minute help before Tuesday’s primary. ​​At the live rally last Friday, Trump had trouble selling the crowd on Oz, who got booed on stage. Barnette’s rise in the race’s home stretch is stunning considering the millions Oz and McCormick have spent introducing themselves to voters and trashing each other in TV ads. They’ve each questioned the other’s conservative credentials, ties to China and spotty residency links to the state they want to represent in Congress. Democrats have their own primary headaches to contend with ahead of what is shaping up to be one of the most competitive races of the cycle. But they couldn’t help gloating a little on Thursday about the situation that Republicans find themselves in. “We have a challenge this year for sure, but this primary they’re having ― it’s so negative, so rancorous, so divisive that I think it’s going to hurt their nominee,” Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) said. Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Kanye West Told Kim Kardashian Her 'Career Is Over' For Dressing Like Marge Simpson,health," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Kim Kardashian’s and Kanye West’s divorce has pulled a smattering of famous types into its orbit (Trevor Noah, Hillary Clinton and, of course Pete Davidson), but never did we expect the former couple to bring Marge Simpson into their mess. On the most recent episode of the famous family’s new Hulu series, “The Kardashians,” the reality TV star expressed anxiety about charting new fashion territory without West, whom she divorced in February 2021 after six years of marriage. The Yeezy founder played an instrumental role in overhauling his former wife’s style ― he demanded that she purge an entire closet of clothes months into their relationship ― and hand-selected nearly every outfit she wore in public until their split. “I got to a point where I would ask his advice for everything down to what I wear,” Kardashian told sister Kourtney on Wednesday’s episode. “Even now I’m having panic attacks, like what do I wear?” Kardashian was left to her own devices for last year’s WSJ. Magazine’s Innovator Awards, where she was honored for her shapewear brand SKIMS. The brown leather dress, which she accessorized with matching gloves and over-the-knee snakeskin boots, however, received less than favorable reviews from West. “He called me afterwards,” Kardashian said. “He told me my career is over and then he showed me a picture of Marge Simpson wearing something similar.” It’s unclear exactly what picture West might’ve been referring to, but viewers quickly came up with a few options on Twitter after the episode aired. Kanye sent Kim a picture of Marge Simpson in a dress similar to what she wore at the Wall Street Journal awards. Who wore it better? #TheKardashians pic.twitter.com/rOnDHZTy0q Ye tells Kim her career was 'over' as he compared her awards dress outfit to a dress worn by The Simpson's character marge. Ye gave her fashion and took it away pic.twitter.com/Ue8ph6o3Jt Simpson, we must note, is a bit of fashion trailblazer in her own right, rocking garments from the luxury fashion house Balenciaga on an animated runway last year. Later on in the episode, Kardashian seemed to find her own footing style-wise, but admitted that she has “never really been the visionary” when it came to fashion. “His love language is clothes,” she said of West. “I always just trusted in him, but it’s not just about clothes. That was, like, the last thing we had really in common.” “I’m trying to figure out, like, who am I in the fashion world? Who am I by myself?” she continued. “I was always, like, The Kardashians with my sisters and then I was, like, Kimye. Like, who is Kim K? That is the jump. How do I get there without Kanye?” If her recent Met Gala ensemble is any indication, Kardashian is doing just fine in the fashion department. She caused all sorts of conversation for slinking into the vintage gown worn by Marilyn Monroe to President John F. Kennedy’s birthday celebration in 1962. Kardashian attended the event alongside boyfriend, “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, who she started dating in the fall after her hosting debut on late-night sketch show. In her new relationship, Kardashian has seemingly assumed West’s role, with Davidson joking on the red carpet that she “didn’t let me wear my propeller hat, but it’s fine.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
6,Republicans Criticize Biden For Not Starving Undocumented Immigrant Babies,health," Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Republicans criticized the Biden administration on Thursday for providing food to infants detained in its custody — effectively suggesting the babies should be starved because of their immigration status. “The Biden administration has been sending pallets of baby formula for illegal mothers and their babies while American mothers and babies cannot find baby formula,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said at a news conference. “This is completely unacceptable, and this needs to end now.” “Baby formula should go to Americans before illegals,” Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) wrote on Twitter. “This should not have to be said.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) accused the administration of giving “critical supplies to illegal immigrants before the very people he took an oath to serve.” Greene referenced photos of baby formula at a border facility, likely referring to a Washington Examiner article about immigrants detained at the border receiving baby formula amid a nationwide shortage. Nehls also tweeted a link to the article. The Examiner refers to the immigrants as a “lucky group” and cites posts by Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) about “thousands and thousands of containers of baby formula” being sent to the border. Cammack said she received a photo of the deliveries from a border agent. Cammack called on people to demand the Biden administration “take the baby formula that they have basically siphoned out of the supply chain and put it back in the damn stores for American kids.” The formula shortage is a crisis. Infants need either breast milk or formula for nutrition until they are at least 1 year old, and breast milk isn’t always an option. Doctors recommend against diluting milk or formula, switching to cow’s milk or making homemade formula. So the need for Americans to access baby formula is very, very real. But babies in U.S. government custody need sustenance, too, and their parents don’t have the option of leaving detention to buy supplies. If the government didn’t provide food to the babies in its custody, they would starve. The baby formula shortage has become a popular way for Republicans to attack President Joe Biden, although few lawmakers from either party have offered actual solutions to the issue. Immigration is a popular attack line, too, so it’s not much of a surprise that the right would blame immigrant babies for stealing food from American ones. The right has demonized undocumented immigrants for years, and the U.S. has a disturbing record of neglecting or mistreating children in its care. In one of the most infamous examples, former President Donald Trump intentionally split children from their parents in an attempt to dissuade immigrants from coming to the United States. For years, Republican lawmakers have blocked efforts to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as kids. Republican politicians have suggested immigrant detention centers, including ones that lock up children, are too nice. The right’s claims about baby formula for undocumented kids fit into the narrative that Democrats are encouraging unauthorized immigration by not being harsher to undocumented people. Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser to Trump who championed many of that administration’s harshest immigration policies, said the Biden administration was “diverting scarce formula to subsidize mass illegal immigration.” How many American Parents couldn’t feed their children, or were forced to use a formula their infants couldn’t tolerate, because Biden was diverting scarce formula to subsidize mass illegal immigration through our open border? https://t.co/hdKFsMvzvo Cammack insisted that her screed against baby formula for undocumented infants was actually part of a pro-children agenda, and she accused the Biden administration of helping cartels smuggle immigrant kids by being insufficiently tough on the border. “It’s not these kids’ fault,” she said. “My heart breaks for these kids.” Just not enough to let them eat.

7,"SI Swimsuit Features First Model With Visible C-Section Scar, And The Reactions Are Mixed",health," Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost In recent years, Sports Illustrated has made a concerted effort to expand the, shall we say, limited perception of female beauty highlighted in its annual Swimsuit issue. In 2016, the publication featured its first plus-size cover girl, Ashley Graham. In 2019, Halima Aden became the first model to appear in the magazine wearing a hijab. And in 2020, Valentina Sampaio became the first openly transgender model to appear in the issue. The latest first for the 58-year-old Swimsuit edition? A model proudly showing her visible cesarean section scar. In SI Swimsuit 2022, model Kelly Hughes flashes a big grin and pulls down her bikini bottoms a smidge to reveal a C-section scar above her pelvic bone. A post shared by Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@si_swimsuit) The photo feature was done in collaboration with pregnancy and postpartum brand Frida Mom, the first brand to partner with Sports Illustrated Swimsuit under its Pay With Change advertising platform. In a statement, Frida Mom founder Chelsea Hirschhorn said the partnership provides a “valuable platform to disrupt the traditional narrative around women’s bodies — especially those they feature who are mothers.” In her Instagram post of the photo, Hughes, who delivered her son via cesarean three years ago, shared her complicated feelings about her C-section scar. “I struggled with insecurities from my scar being that I’m a model and my incredibly difficult recovery but it wasn’t until I embraced my scar that I experienced the true power in it,” she wrote. According to the latest research from the World Health Organization, births by C-section continue to rise globally, now accounting for more than 1 in 5 (21%) of all childbirths. In the U.S., nearly a third of people who give birth now deliver babies via cesarean section. Despite how common the procedure is, many people are left with guilt or shame after having a C-section, especially if their intention going in was to have a vaginal delivery. As Sports Illustrated notes on its site, “the cultural misconception of labeling C-sections as ‘the easy way out’” doesn’t help matters. Then there’s the body shame many feel about their visible scars, even years later, said Carla Korn, a psychotherapist and body image expert in Westlake Village, California. “So many women feel uncomfortable about their scars being on display and make attempts to hide them,” she told HuffPost. Korn thinks seeing a C-section scar in Sports Illustrated “helps send the message to postpartum women that their scar is nothing to be ashamed of.” For male readers coming across the photo, Korn thinks the message conveyed is just as powerful. (Though if they’re familiar with the newer, more inclusive Swimsuit edition ― “Woke Illustrated,” as some have called it ― they probably won’t be too surprised to see it.) “I think the photo shows that women’s bodies are uniquely capable and magical, especially in how we grow babies and give birth,” she said. “Our bodies’ diversity and perceived imperfections make them even more beautiful.” Melissa Weinberg, a psychotherapist in private practice who specializes in the treatment of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, especially during pregnancy and in the postpartum period, loves that the magazine is normalizing postpartum bodies. Still, she wishes the publication had pushed even further. “It’s certainly a step in the right direction, but it’s hard to get too excited about photos that completely reinforce every other aspect of unhelpful and unachievable beauty ideals that makes most women, including postpartum women, feel like garbage,” she told HuffPost. As nice as the photo is, it doesn’t do much to disrupt the norm of “thin white cis blond women” being revered for their beauty, she added. “Will this be the new standard of how postpartum bodies should look? Will a woman who in most ways looks nothing like this model, aside from their shared C-section scars, feel even worse about her postpartum body in comparison?” she asked. “These photos are really cool, but not enough,” she added. “We need more diversity and inclusivity.” That being noted, Weinberg said it’s always refreshing to see C-sections normalized. “I hope that these photos send the message to anyone viewing them, men included, that C-sections and the marks they leave are unbelievably common and not something to be hidden, but celebrated, something as normal as freckles,” she said. “As a society we want to ignore the details ― glorious and gory ― of such a normal part of the human experience: childbirth.” On social media, the glossy photo has elicited a range of emotions for women who have had C-sections themselves. Some are happily surprised to see scars like theirs shown in the pages of Sports Illustrated. Others have noted that their scars aren’t quite as subtle as Hughes’ due to a “classic” vertical incision rather than a side-to-side “bikini cut,” or that they healed weirdly. Way to go Sports Illustrated, some of us have that scar https://t.co/W5T8T7IVlD Amanda Kammarada, an artist and author who had two C-sections, in 2009 and 2012, was so happy to see the photos featured in a NowThis video, she tweeted it out to her followers. “It made me feel proud of my scar,” she told HuffPost. “Seeing that kind of representation in that type of magazine is a really big deal.” If the picture chips away at the stigma associated with C-sections even slightly, Kammarada said she’s happy. “There are some who say that a C-section isn’t really ‘giving birth,’” she said. “A woman’s body is incredible and there should be no shame in how you have your child.” Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost"
8,Russian Threats Push Finland Toward Joining NATO Alliance,health," KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Finland’s leaders Thursday came out in favor of applying to join NATO, and Sweden could do the same within days, in a historic realignment on the continent 2 1/2 months after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine sent a shiver of fear through Moscow’s neighbors. The Kremlin reacted by warning it will be forced to take retaliatory “military-technical” steps. On the ground, meanwhile, Russian forces pounded areas in central, northern and eastern Ukraine, including the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol, as part its offensive to take the industrial Donbas region, while Ukraine recaptured some towns and villages in the northeast. The first war-crimes trial of a Russian soldier since the start of the conflict is set to open Friday in Kyiv. A 21-year-old captured member of a tank unit is accused of shooting to death a civilian on a bicycle during the opening week of the war. Finland’s president and prime minister announced that the Nordic country should apply right away for membership in NATO, the military defense pact founded in part to counter the Soviet Union. “You (Russia) caused this. Look in the mirror,” Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said this week. While the country’s Parliament still has to weigh in, the announcement means Finland is all but certain to apply — and gain admission — though the process could take months to complete. Sweden, likewise, is considering putting itself under NATO’s protection. That would represent a major change in Europe’s security landscape: Sweden has avoided military alliances for more than 200 years, while Finland adopted neutrality after its defeat by the Soviets in World War II. Public opinion in both nations shifted dramatically in favor of NATO membership after the invasion, which stirred fears in countries along Russia’s flank that they could be next. Such an expansion of the alliance would leave Russia surrounded by NATO countries in the Baltic Sea and the Arctic and would amount to a stinging setback for Putin, who had hoped to divide and roll back NATO in Europe but is instead seeing the opposite happen. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said the alliance would welcome Finland and Sweden with open arms. Russia’s Foreign Ministry warned that Moscow “will be forced to take retaliatory steps of military-technical and other characteristics in order to counter the emerging threats to its national security.” NATO’s funneling of weapons and other military support to Ukraine already has been critical to Kyiv’s surprising success in stymieing the invasion, and the Kremlin warned anew in chilling terms Thursday that the aid could lead to direct conflict between NATO and Russia. “There is always a risk of such conflict turning into a full-scale nuclear war, a scenario that will be catastrophic for all,” said Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council. While Russia’s advance in the Donbas has been slow, its forces have gained some ground and taken some villages. Four civilians were killed Thursday in three communities in the Donetsk region, which is part of the Donbas, the regional governor reported. Britain’s Defense Ministry said Russia’s focus on the Donbas has left its remaining troops around the northeastern city of Kharkiv vulnerable to counterattack from Ukrainian forces, which recaptured several towns and villages around the city. Russian strikes Thursday killed at least two civilians on the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, local authorities said. The attacks also damaged a building housing a humanitarian aid unit, municipal offices and hospital facilities, Vyacheslav Zadorenko, the mayor of the suburban town of Derhachi, wrote in a Telegram post. None of the sites “had anything to do with military infrastructure,” Zadorenko said. Fighting across the east has driven many thousands of Ukrainians from their homes. “It is terrible there now. We were leaving under missiles,” said Tatiana Kravstova, who left the town of Siversk with her 8-year-old son Artiom on a bus headed for the central city of Dnipro. “I don’t know where they were aiming, but they were pointing at civilians.” Ukraine also said Russian forces had fired artillery and grenade launchers at Ukrainian troops around Zaporizhzhia, which has been a refuge for civilians fleeing Mariupol, and attacked in the Chernihiv and Sumy regions to the north. Overnight airstrikes near Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, killed at least three people, Ukraine’s military said. It said that Russian troops fired rockets at a school and student dormitory in Novhorod-Siversky and that some other buildings, including private homes, were also damaged. In his evening address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the assaults. “Of course, the Russian state is in such a state that any education only gets in its way. But what can be achieved by destroying Ukrainian schools? All Russian commanders who give such orders are simply sick and incurable.” Noting that Thursday is International Nurses Day, Zelenskyy said the Russian military had damaged 570 medical facilities since the invasion began on Feb. 24 and fully destroyed 101 hospitals. Twelve Russian missiles struck an oil refinery and other infrastructure in the central Ukrainian industrial hub of Kremenchuk on Thursday, the region’s acting governor, Dmytro Lunin, wrote in a Telegram post. In early April, he said, the refinery, which had been the last fully functional one in Ukraine at the time, was knocked offline by an attack. In the southern port of Mariupol, which has largely been reduced to smoking rubble with little food, water or medicine, or what the mayor called a “medieval ghetto,” Ukrainian fighters continued to hold out at the Azovstal steel plant, the last stronghold of resistance in the city. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said negotiations were underway with Russia to win the release of 38 severely wounded Ukrainian defenders from the plant. She said Ukraine hoped to exchange them for 38 “significant” Russian prisoners of war. ___ Yesica Fisch in Bakhmut, David Keyton in Kyiv, Yuras Karmanau in Lviv, Mstyslav Chernov in Kharkiv, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, and other AP staffers around the world contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"
9,Rob Reiner Confirms Sequel To 'This Is Spinal Tap' Is In The Works,health," Senior Reporter, HuffPost After nearly 40 years, the classic 1984 movie “This Is Spinal Tap” is getting a sequel. Dateline is reporting that the spoof heavy-metal band created by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer will be making a comeback in a sequel to the mockumentary called “Spinal Tap II.” Sadly, it looks like the number in the title is meant to be a “2,” and not the number “11,” which looms large in the band’s legend, as you can see from this clip from the first movie. Rob Reiner will direct the movie as well as reprise his role as doofus documentarian Marty DiBergi. He told Deadline that he was constantly asked about whether there would ever be a sequel to the film but said that he and his collaborators came up with the right approach only recently. “You don’t want to just do it to do it. You want to honor the first one and push it a little further with the story,” he said. Reiner noted that Guest, McKean and Shearer have performed as Spinal Tap all over the world but “haven’t spent any time together recently, and that became the premise.” He said the plot will center on the death of longtime manager Ian Faith, played in the film by Tony Hendra. “Ian’s widow inherited a contract that said Spinal Tap owed them one more concert. She was basically going to sue them if they didn’t,” Reiner explained. “All these years and a lot of bad blood we’ll get into, and they’re thrown back together and forced to deal with each other and play this concert.” Reiner said there might be some cameos from famous musicians in the film and added that band might also do a book dedicated to the experiences of real-life rockers that parallel the incidents in the movie. “Like in the movie, they get stoned and can’t find the stage, that happened to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,” Reiner said. The new film will be released March 19, 2024, or 40 years and 17 days after the original’s world premiere. Of course, Twitter users had thoughts. Please call it This Was Spinal Tap https://t.co/I25dabJg6R reminder that the actors did the DVD commentary of the original spinal tap in character; it essentially functions as a half sequel https://t.co/Hkj5DexMUc My prediction for Spinal Tap 2022: One member will grapple with the band’s history of misogyny in a post-MeToo world, another will be a “keep politics out of music” guy, and the third will be obsessed with NFTs. https://t.co/P6qolCG5xw And, of course, someone quoted one of the film’s lines.

10,North Korea Orders Nationwide Lockdown After Confirming 1st COVID-19 Case,health," SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea imposed a nationwide lockdown Thursday to control its first acknowledged COVID-19 outbreak after holding for more than two years to a widely doubted claim of a perfect record keeping out the virus that has spread to nearly every place in the world. The outbreak forced leader Kim Jong Un to wear a mask in public, likely for the first time since the start of the pandemic, but the scale of transmissions inside North Korea wasn’t immediately known. A failure to slow infections could have serious consequences because the country has a poor health care system and its 26 million people are believed to be mostly unvaccinated. Some experts say North Korea, by its rare admission of an outbreak, may be seeking outside aid. The official Korean Central News Agency said tests of samples collected Sunday from an unspecified number of people with fevers in the capital, Pyongyang, confirmed they were infected with the omicron variant. In response, Kim called at a ruling party Politburo meeting for a thorough lockdown of cities and counties and said workplaces should be isolated by units to block the virus from spreading. He urged health workers to step up disinfection efforts at workplaces and homes and mobilize reserve medical supplies. Kim said it was crucial to control transmissions and eliminate the infection source as fast as possible, while also easing inconveniences to the public caused by the virus controls. He insisted the country will overcome the outbreak because its government and people are “united as one.” Despite the elevated virus response, Kim ordered officials to push ahead with scheduled construction, agricultural development and other state projects while bolstering the country’s defense posture to avoid any security vacuum. North Korea’s state TV showed Kim and other senior officials wearing masks as they entered a meeting room, although Kim removed his mask to speak into a set of microphones. Still photos distributed by KNCA showed Kim unmasked and sitting at the head of a table where all other officials remained masked. South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, couldn’t immediately confirm whether it was the first time state media showed Kim wearing a mask since the start of the pandemic. Kim has previously spoken to huge crowds without a mask as he praised the country’s earlier pandemic response, and his decision to be seen with a mask could be aimed at raising public vigilance. North Korea, which has maintained strict anti-virus controls at its borders for more than two years, didn’t provide further details about its new lockdown. But an Associated Press photographer on the South Korean side of the border saw dozens of people working in fields or walking on footpaths at a North Korean border town — an indication the lockdown doesn’t require people to stay home, or it exempts farm work. The measures described in state media and Kim’s declaration that economic goals should still be met could indicate that North Korea is focusing more on restricting travel and supplies between regions, analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at South Korea’s Sejong Institute said. North Korea’s government has shunned vaccines offered by the U.N.-backed COVAX distribution program, possibly because they have international monitoring requirements. Seoul’s Unification Ministry said South Korea is willing to provide medical assistance and other help to North Korea based on humanitarian considerations. Relations between the Koreas have deteriorated since 2019 amid a stalemate in nuclear negotiations and the North’s increasingly provocative weapons tests. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Beijing is offering North Korea help in dealing with the outbreak. North Korea has reportedly rejected previous Chinese offers of domestically developed vaccines. Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Seoul’s Korea University College of Medicine, said North Korea is likely signaling its willingness to receive outside vaccines, but wants many more doses than offered by COVAX to inoculate its entire population multiple times. He said North Korea would also want COVID-19 medicines and medical equipment shipments that are banned by U.N. sanctions. Omicron spreads much more easily than earlier variants of the coronavirus, and its fatality and hospitalization rates are high among unvaccinated older people or those with existing health problems. That means the outbreak could cause “a serious situation” because North Korea lacks medical equipment and medicine to treat virus patients and many of its people are not well-nourished, Kim Sin-gon said. Ahn Kyung-su, head of DPRKHEALTH.ORG, a website focusing on health issues in North Korea, said North Korea’s admission of the outbreak is likely designed to press its people harder to guard against the virus as China, which shares a long, porous border with the North, has placed many of its cities under lockdown over virus concerns. North Korea will also likely stress lockdowns, although the experience of China’s “zero-COVID” policy suggests that approach doesn’t work against the fast-moving omicron variant, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University. “For Pyongyang to publicly admit omicron cases, the public health situation must be serious,” Easley said. “This does not mean North Korea is suddenly going to be open to humanitarian assistance and take a more conciliatory line toward Washington and Seoul. But the Kim regime’s domestic audience may be less interested in nuclear or missile tests when the urgent threat involves coronavirus rather than a foreign military.” North Korea’s previous coronavirus-free claim had been disputed by many foreign experts. But South Korean officials have said North Korea had likely avoided a huge outbreak, in part because it instituted strict virus controls almost from the start of the pandemic. Early in 2020 — before the coronavirus spread around the world — North Korea took severe steps to keep out the virus and described them as a matter of “national existence.” It all but halted cross-border traffic and trade for two years, and is even believed to have ordered troops to shoot on sight any trespassers who crossed its borders. The extreme border closures further shocked an economy already damaged by decades of mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and missile program, pushing Kim to perhaps the toughest moment of his rule since he took power in 2011. North Korea had been one of the last places in the world without an acknowledged COVID-19 case after the virus first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 spread to every continent including Antarctica. Turkmenistan, a similarly secretive and authoritarian nation in Central Asia, has reported no cases to the World Health Organization, though its claim also is widely doubted by outside experts. In recent months, some Pacific island nations that kept the virus out by their geographic isolation have recorded outbreaks. Only tiny Tuvalu, with a population around 12,000, has escaped the virus so far, while a few other nations – Nauru, Micronesia and Marshall Islands – have stopped cases at their borders and avoided community outbreaks. North Korea’s outbreak comes as China — its close ally and trading partner — battles its biggest outbreak of the pandemic. In January, North Korea tentatively reopened railroad freight traffic between its border town of Sinuiju and China’s Dandong for the first time in two years, but China halted the trade last month due to an outbreak in Liaoning province, which borders North Korea. ___ Associated Press journalists Lee Jin-man in Paju, South Korea, Ken Moritsugu in Beijing and Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report."
11,COVID-19 Cases Rise While Few School Mask Mandates Return,health," CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — U.S. COVID-19 cases are up, leading a smattering of school districts, particularly in the Northeast, to bring back mask mandates and recommendations for the first time since the omicron winter surge ended and as the country approaches 1 million deaths in the pandemic. The return of masking in schools is not nearly as widespread as earlier in the pandemic, particularly as the public’s worries over the virus have ebbed. But districts in Maine, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have brought masks back, with a few in Massachusetts also recommending them even as the school year enters its final weeks. Maine’s largest school district, in Portland, said this week masks would return, with Superintendent Xavier Botana saying that was the “safest course at this time” amid rising cases. Bangor, Maine, schools also brought back a universal mask requirement. High schools in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and in Montclair, New Jersey, a commuter suburb of New York City, also announced a return to masking, albeit temporarily through this week. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of the counties in the country considered to have “high” levels of COVID-19 are in the Northeast. In parts of Massachusetts that have seen high levels of COVID-19 transmission, authorities are also recommending masks in schools. Reactions have ranged from supportive to angry. On the Facebook page of Woodland Hills High School in suburban Pittsburgh, one woman called the change “#insane.” Diana Martinez and Owen Cornwall, who have a first-grader at Graham and Parks School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have been following the recommendation to mask their daughter. “We’re very happy about it. It gives us a little peace of mind,” said Martinez, 42, a professor at Tufts University. “I think the parents generally trend toward wearing them and that gives us some comfort. It’s the same case at our pre-school. There will be a couple of parents who don’t mask their child, but we will be masking our child.” Cornwall said there seems to be a general consensus in the school community in favor of playing it safe. “We’re sort of lucky in this neighborhood, that they share our concerns with health,” said Cornwall, 37, a visiting scholar at Tufts. Reported daily cases in the U.S. are averaging 79,000, up 50% over the past two weeks, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That’s a fraction of where daily case counts stood earlier this year, when they topped 800,000. However, current case counts are a vast undercount because of a major downturn in testing and the fact tests are being taken at home and not reported to health departments. An influential modeling group at the University of Washington in Seattle estimates that only 13% of cases are being reported to health authorities in the U.S. — which would mean an undercount of more than a half million new infections every day. Despite the uptick in cases and the return to masking in a small number of schools, the response across the country has been largely subdued, reflecting the public’s exhaustion after more than two years of restrictions. Outside of schools, however, officials have shown little interest in returning to mask mandates. Last month, Philadelphia abandoned its indoor mask mandate just days after becoming the first large American city to reimpose the requirement in response to an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The United States is approaching the grim marker of 1 million deaths from COVID-19. Globally, there have been more than 6 million deaths in the pandemic, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. Hospital workers at Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, California, who labored through the worst of the pandemic paused Wednesday to recognize the sacrifice. Intensive care unit nurse coordinator Patsy Brandenburger was among the many hospital caregivers who received a blessing from Father Patrick Okonkwo, a hospital chaplain, during the Roman Catholic ceremony. She recalled the worst days of the pandemic, when the hospital was filled with hundreds of patients, including dozens on ventilators; now the hospital has just seven COVID-19 patients. “The amount of patients we saw that passed away in the ICU was so, so, so hard. And just the families that couldn’t be there with them was extremely hard on all of us,” Brandenburger said fighting away tears. ___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey. Associated Press writers Eugene Garcia in Orange, California, Patrick Whittle in Portland, Maine, and AP writers across the country contributed."
12,New Jersey Governor Announces Proposals To Expand Abortion Access In The State,health," National Reporter, HuffPost New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) on Wednesday announced legislation to expand reproductive health care coverage in the state, with a particular eye on abortion access ― and other states’ efforts to curtail it. Speaking from behind a pink placard reading “Ensuring Reproductive Freedom,” Murphy rolled out a handful of proposals that build on the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, which codified the right to an abortion into state law earlier this year. “In the coming weeks, a right-wing majority on the U.S. Supreme Court likely will take a wrecking ball to 50 years of its own precedent, and for the very first time in American history overturn a decision in order to diminish our rights,” the governor said, explaining the impetus for his proposals. “Without access, rights mean nothing,” he added. Murphy then urged the state Assembly to pass legislation expanding the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, in particular seeking to: That last point is a particularly interesting development. While Republican-led states across the country have enacted abortion bans aimed at challenging Roe v. Wade, some, like Texas, have gone further. In Texas, any private citizen is entitled to collect $10,000 if they bring a successful lawsuit against someone who performed ― or helped a woman obtain ― an abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the fetus, which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy. That can even include driving the woman to the airport to receive health care in another state. Murphy didn’t describe in detail how he intends to shield New Jersey’s medical providers from complying with legal action that originates in another state, but he was adamant about the commitment. “Let me be clear,” he said in a statement after the speech. “New Jersey will not cooperate with any out of state investigation into our health care providers that seeks to punish anyone ― patient, provider, counselor, friend, or Uber driver ― for providing abortion care.” “Abortion is health care and health care decisions should be left up to the individual,” he added. “With the legislation we’ve announced today, New Jersey will continue to lead the way forward on reproductive freedom.” National Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

13,U.S. Drug Overdose Deaths Set Another Tragic Record,health," NEW YORK (AP) — More than 107,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year, setting another tragic record in the nation’s escalating overdose epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated Wednesday. The provisional 2021 total translates to roughly one U.S. overdose death every 5 minutes. It marked a 15% increase from the previous record, set the year before. The CDC reviews death certificates and then makes an estimate to account for delayed and incomplete reporting. Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, called the the latest numbers “truly staggering.” U.S. overdose deaths have risen most years for more than two decades. The increase began in the 1990s with overdoses involving opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and — most recently — illicit fentanyl. Last year, overdoses involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids surpassed 71,000, up 23% from the year before. There also was a 23% increase in deaths involving cocaine and a 34% increase in deaths involving meth and other stimulants. Overdose deaths are often attributed to more than one drug. Some people take multiple drugs and inexpensive fentanyl has been increasingly cut into other drugs, often without the buyers’ knowledge, officials say. “The net effect is that we have many more people, including those who use drugs occasionally and even adolescents, exposed to these potent substances that can cause someone to overdose even with a relatively small exposure,” Volkow said in a statement. Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem as lockdowns and other restrictions isolated those with drug addictions and made treatment harder to get. Overdose death trends are geographically uneven. Alaska saw a 75% increase in 2021 — the largest jump of any state. In Hawaii, overdose deaths fell by 2%. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.
