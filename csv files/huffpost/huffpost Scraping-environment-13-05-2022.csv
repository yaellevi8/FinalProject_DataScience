0,Scientists Grow Plants In Lunar Soil For First Time Ever,environment," CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — For the first time, scientists have grown plants in soil from the moon collected by NASA’s Apollo astronauts. Researchers had no idea if anything would sprout in the harsh moon dirt and wanted to see if it could be used to grow food by the next generation of lunar explorers. The results stunned them. “Holy cow. Plants actually grow in lunar stuff. Are you kidding me?” said Robert Ferl of the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Ferl and his colleagues planted thale cress in moon soil returned by Apollo 11′s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and other moonwalkers. The good news: All of the seeds sprouted. The downside was that after the first week, the coarseness and other properties of the lunar soil stressed the small, flowering weeds so much that they grew more slowly than seedlings planted in fake moon dirt from Earth. Most of the moon plants ended up stunted. Results were published Thursday in Communications Biology. The longer the soil was exposed to punishing cosmic radiation and solar wind on the moon, the worse the plants seemed to do. The Apollo 11 samples — exposed a couple billion years longer to the elements because of the Sea of Tranquility’s older surface — were the least conducive for growth, according to scientists. “This is a big step forward to know that you can grow plants,” said Simon Gilroy, a space plant biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who had no role in the study. “The real next step is to go and do it on the surface of the moon.” Moon dirt is full of tiny, glass fragments from micrometeorite impacts that got everywhere in the Apollo lunar landers and wore down the moonwalkers’ spacesuits. One solution might be to use younger geologic spots on the moon, like lava flows, for digging up planting soil. The environment also could be tweaked, altering the nutrient mixture or adjusting the artificial lighting, Only 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of moon rocks and soil were brought back by six Apollo crews. Some of the earliest moon dust was sprinkled on plants under quarantine with the Apollo astronauts in Houston after returning from the moon. Most of the lunar stash remained locked away, forcing researchers to experiment with simulated soil made of volcanic ash on Earth. NASA finally doled out 12 grams to the University of Florida researchers early last year, and the long-awaited planting took place last May in a lab. NASA said the timing for such an experiment was finally right, with the space agency looking to put astronauts back on the moon in a few years. The ideal situation would be for future astronauts to tap into the endless supply of available local dirt for indoor planting versus setting up a hydroponic, or all-water, system, scientists said. “The fact that anything grew means that we have a really good starting point, and now the question is how do we optimize and improve,” said Sharmila Bhattacharya, NASA’s program scientist for space biology, The Florida scientists hope to recycle their lunar soil later this year, planting more thale cress before possibly moving on to other vegetation. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

1,"91% Of Surveyed Corals Bleached Along Great Barrier Reef, Australia Says",environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost SYDNEY ― More than 90% of coral reefs surveyed along Australia’s Great Barrier Reef were bleached in recent months due to catastrophically warm ocean temperatures, according to a new report by the top government agency monitoring the structure’s health. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority released its “Reef Snapshot” report Tuesday after conducting aerial surveys of the structure following reports it was suffering from mass bleaching earlier this year. Researchers monitored 719 reefs along the eastern coast of Australia, saying 654 of those showed signs of at least some bleaching. Many of those were classified as severely or extremely bleached. “The Great Barrier Reef’s waters warmed early in December 2021, exceeding historical summer maximums that typically occur in the hottest summer months,” the agency said in a release this week. “This prolonged heat exposure led to a mass bleaching of coral across the Great Barrier Reef; the fourth to occur in seven years. Unusually, this was the first mass bleaching event to occur under La Niña conditions.” The marine park authority said Tuesday that scientists had observed some severe bleaching along some surveyed sights, including “completely white colonies” and coral death in areas hit hardest by the warm oceans. The marine park authority first said in March that the iconic structure was undergoing another devastating mass bleaching event, the fourth since 2016, due to abnormally warm ocean temperatures. It’s the first time, however, that a mass bleaching has happened during a La Niña year, when the ocean is supposed to be cooler than usual. Bleaching happens most often when corals are effectively cooked by warmer than usual water, which causes the delicate polyps to turn a sickly white. They can recover if temperatures stabilize, but if the warm water lingers for too long, huge swaths of the reef can die. The report was quietly published Tuesday night, a week after The Sydney Morning Herald reported the document had been delayed until after Australia’s federal election. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority maintained at the time the decision had nothing to do with politics, although scientists and environmentalists criticized the agency for not publishing the findings sooner. The agency’s chief scientist, David Wachenfeld, said there was hope the bleaching wouldn’t lead to widespread death of corals. “The early indications are the mortality won’t be very high so we are hoping that we will see most of the coral that is bleached recover, and we will end up with an event rather more like 2020 where yes there was mass bleaching but there was low mortality,” Wachenfeld told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. But reef advocates have stressed that any mass bleaching event is devastating news. “This was a La Niña year, normally characterized by more cloud cover and rain,” Lissa Schindler, a campaign manger for the Australian Marine Conservation Society, told The Guardian. “It should have been a welcome reprieve for our reef to help it recover … This is not normal and we should not accept that this is the way things are.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has faced fierce criticism for failing to address climate change, instead throwing his support behind the coal and mining industries. The country has pledged to spend more than $2 billion to protect the structure, but advocates say that figure fails to address the root cause of its demise: our rapidly warming world. Scientists had hoped the season would give corals walloped by frequent bleaching time to recover, but they said the latest event was a “grim” sign for the future of the reef. Instead, some warned that the next strong El Niño summer — when waters are hotter than usual — would be “awful” for the reef. Compared to earlier mass bleaching events, 2022 was more severe than 1998 - then the hottest year on record, and 2002. 2016 (an El Niño summer) remains the most deadly event, killing 30% of corals. 51% died in the north.The next strong El Niño will be awful. https://t.co/4OgAL1fdEx pic.twitter.com/XlMX3tAZ6u Senior Reporter, HuffPost"

3,Dog Rescued From Cage Thrown Into River Finds New Home: 'He Still Loves People',environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A young Michigan dog with a resilient spirit has found a new home after being rescued from a perilous situation. VanBuren, a puppy estimated to be 5 to 6 months old, was picked up by animal control after someone found him “locked in a black wire crate in a river,” Jackson County Animal Shelter spokesperson Lydia Sattler told HuffPost in an email. VanBuren was taken to the shelter, which wrote about his plight last week in a Facebook post that went viral. The shelter noted that “thankfully” someone spotted the cage in the river “before the rains came,” when the water wasn’t too high. The post included a photo showing VanBuren’s leg healing from a “nasty break” that he had when he was found. He also had “several abrasions,” Sattler added. But the trauma he’d been through apparently didn’t dampen the puppy’s loving spirit. “He is absolutely a wiggle bottom and full of kisses for everyone,” Sattler said. The shelter’s post also noted that VanBuren “still loves people” and aspires to be the “best doggo ever.” His sweet attitude is likely a big reason it didn’t take long for him to find a home. On Monday, Sattler said VanBuren had been adopted and shared a happy photo of the pup with his new family. Congrats, VanBuren! Assignment editor, HuffPost"
4,Trump Frets Over Underdog Surge In Dr. Oz Senate Race,environment," Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost The sudden rise of conservative commentator and author Kathy Barnette in polls has Donald Trump apparently worried about his pick in Pennsylvania’s GOP Senate race, celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz. Following the release of a Fox News poll that showed Barnette within striking distance of Oz, Trump released a statement slamming Barnette as too weak to face the Democrat in the general election. “Kathy Barnette will never be able to win the General Election against the Radical Left Democrats,” Trump said Thursday in a news release from his political action committee. In the same statement, Trump left the door open to supporting her if she wins, an effort to cover his bases in light of increasing scrutiny about the waning power of his political endorsements. “She has many things in her past which have not been properly explained or vetted, but if she is able to do so, she will have a wonderful future in the Republican Party — and I will be behind her all the way,” he said. Barnette, who wrote a book about being Black and conservative and who has never held public office, has a lengthy history of anti-Muslim and anti-gay statements, according to CNN. She falsely accused former President Barack Obama of being a secret Muslim and has suggested banning Islam. She’s also dabbled in fraud conspiracies concerning the 2020 election. The Fox poll from Tuesday showed Barnette with 19% of the vote, just behind Oz at 22% and former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick at 20%. It also had 18% of voters still undecided. National Republicans are choosing to stay out of the fray for now. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is neutral when it comes to the primary. On Thursday, he downplayed concerns about Barnette’s viability as a general election candidate and projected confidence about winning the open seat no matter who comes out on top. “We’ll win Pennsylvania,” Scott told HuffPost. But Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), the vice chair of the Senate GOP conference, defended Barnette by calling her “extraordinary.” “Just because you’re a political newcomer doesn’t mean we write you off,” Ernst said in an interview with CNN. Trump on Thursday also announced a tele-rally for Oz just days after he traveled to the state to hold a MAGA rally for the former “Dr. Oz Show” host — another sign that the former president believes Oz might need his last-minute help before Tuesday’s primary. ​​At the live rally last Friday, Trump had trouble selling the crowd on Oz, who got booed on stage. Barnette’s rise in the race’s home stretch is stunning considering the millions Oz and McCormick have spent introducing themselves to voters and trashing each other in TV ads. They’ve each questioned the other’s conservative credentials, ties to China and spotty residency links to the state they want to represent in Congress. Democrats have their own primary headaches to contend with ahead of what is shaping up to be one of the most competitive races of the cycle. But they couldn’t help gloating a little on Thursday about the situation that Republicans find themselves in. “We have a challenge this year for sure, but this primary they’re having ― it’s so negative, so rancorous, so divisive that I think it’s going to hurt their nominee,” Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) said. Politics Reporter, HuffPost Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

5,Kanye West Told Kim Kardashian Her 'Career Is Over' For Dressing Like Marge Simpson,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost Kim Kardashian’s and Kanye West’s divorce has pulled a smattering of famous types into its orbit (Trevor Noah, Hillary Clinton and, of course Pete Davidson), but never did we expect the former couple to bring Marge Simpson into their mess. On the most recent episode of the famous family’s new Hulu series, “The Kardashians,” the reality TV star expressed anxiety about charting new fashion territory without West, whom she divorced in February 2021 after six years of marriage. The Yeezy founder played an instrumental role in overhauling his former wife’s style ― he demanded that she purge an entire closet of clothes months into their relationship ― and hand-selected nearly every outfit she wore in public until their split. “I got to a point where I would ask his advice for everything down to what I wear,” Kardashian told sister Kourtney on Wednesday’s episode. “Even now I’m having panic attacks, like what do I wear?” Kardashian was left to her own devices for last year’s WSJ. Magazine’s Innovator Awards, where she was honored for her shapewear brand SKIMS. The brown leather dress, which she accessorized with matching gloves and over-the-knee snakeskin boots, however, received less than favorable reviews from West. “He called me afterwards,” Kardashian said. “He told me my career is over and then he showed me a picture of Marge Simpson wearing something similar.” It’s unclear exactly what picture West might’ve been referring to, but viewers quickly came up with a few options on Twitter after the episode aired. Kanye sent Kim a picture of Marge Simpson in a dress similar to what she wore at the Wall Street Journal awards. Who wore it better? #TheKardashians pic.twitter.com/rOnDHZTy0q Ye tells Kim her career was 'over' as he compared her awards dress outfit to a dress worn by The Simpson's character marge. Ye gave her fashion and took it away pic.twitter.com/Ue8ph6o3Jt Simpson, we must note, is a bit of fashion trailblazer in her own right, rocking garments from the luxury fashion house Balenciaga on an animated runway last year. Later on in the episode, Kardashian seemed to find her own footing style-wise, but admitted that she has “never really been the visionary” when it came to fashion. “His love language is clothes,” she said of West. “I always just trusted in him, but it’s not just about clothes. That was, like, the last thing we had really in common.” “I’m trying to figure out, like, who am I in the fashion world? Who am I by myself?” she continued. “I was always, like, The Kardashians with my sisters and then I was, like, Kimye. Like, who is Kim K? That is the jump. How do I get there without Kanye?” If her recent Met Gala ensemble is any indication, Kardashian is doing just fine in the fashion department. She caused all sorts of conversation for slinking into the vintage gown worn by Marilyn Monroe to President John F. Kennedy’s birthday celebration in 1962. Kardashian attended the event alongside boyfriend, “Saturday Night Live” star Pete Davidson, who she started dating in the fall after her hosting debut on late-night sketch show. In her new relationship, Kardashian has seemingly assumed West’s role, with Davidson joking on the red carpet that she “didn’t let me wear my propeller hat, but it’s fine.” Senior Reporter, HuffPost"
6,Republicans Criticize Biden For Not Starving Undocumented Immigrant Babies,environment," Deputy Politics Editor, HuffPost Republicans criticized the Biden administration on Thursday for providing food to infants detained in its custody — effectively suggesting the babies should be starved because of their immigration status. “The Biden administration has been sending pallets of baby formula for illegal mothers and their babies while American mothers and babies cannot find baby formula,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said at a news conference. “This is completely unacceptable, and this needs to end now.” “Baby formula should go to Americans before illegals,” Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) wrote on Twitter. “This should not have to be said.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) accused the administration of giving “critical supplies to illegal immigrants before the very people he took an oath to serve.” Greene referenced photos of baby formula at a border facility, likely referring to a Washington Examiner article about immigrants detained at the border receiving baby formula amid a nationwide shortage. Nehls also tweeted a link to the article. The Examiner refers to the immigrants as a “lucky group” and cites posts by Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) about “thousands and thousands of containers of baby formula” being sent to the border. Cammack said she received a photo of the deliveries from a border agent. Cammack called on people to demand the Biden administration “take the baby formula that they have basically siphoned out of the supply chain and put it back in the damn stores for American kids.” The formula shortage is a crisis. Infants need either breast milk or formula for nutrition until they are at least 1 year old, and breast milk isn’t always an option. Doctors recommend against diluting milk or formula, switching to cow’s milk or making homemade formula. So the need for Americans to access baby formula is very, very real. But babies in U.S. government custody need sustenance, too, and their parents don’t have the option of leaving detention to buy supplies. If the government didn’t provide food to the babies in its custody, they would starve. The baby formula shortage has become a popular way for Republicans to attack President Joe Biden, although few lawmakers from either party have offered actual solutions to the issue. Immigration is a popular attack line, too, so it’s not much of a surprise that the right would blame immigrant babies for stealing food from American ones. The right has demonized undocumented immigrants for years, and the U.S. has a disturbing record of neglecting or mistreating children in its care. In one of the most infamous examples, former President Donald Trump intentionally split children from their parents in an attempt to dissuade immigrants from coming to the United States. For years, Republican lawmakers have blocked efforts to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as kids. Republican politicians have suggested immigrant detention centers, including ones that lock up children, are too nice. The right’s claims about baby formula for undocumented kids fit into the narrative that Democrats are encouraging unauthorized immigration by not being harsher to undocumented people. Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser to Trump who championed many of that administration’s harshest immigration policies, said the Biden administration was “diverting scarce formula to subsidize mass illegal immigration.” How many American Parents couldn’t feed their children, or were forced to use a formula their infants couldn’t tolerate, because Biden was diverting scarce formula to subsidize mass illegal immigration through our open border? https://t.co/hdKFsMvzvo Cammack insisted that her screed against baby formula for undocumented infants was actually part of a pro-children agenda, and she accused the Biden administration of helping cartels smuggle immigrant kids by being insufficiently tough on the border. “It’s not these kids’ fault,” she said. “My heart breaks for these kids.” Just not enough to let them eat.

7,"SI Swimsuit Features First Model With Visible C-Section Scar, And The Reactions Are Mixed",environment," Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost In recent years, Sports Illustrated has made a concerted effort to expand the, shall we say, limited perception of female beauty highlighted in its annual Swimsuit issue. In 2016, the publication featured its first plus-size cover girl, Ashley Graham. In 2019, Halima Aden became the first model to appear in the magazine wearing a hijab. And in 2020, Valentina Sampaio became the first openly transgender model to appear in the issue. The latest first for the 58-year-old Swimsuit edition? A model proudly showing her visible cesarean section scar. In SI Swimsuit 2022, model Kelly Hughes flashes a big grin and pulls down her bikini bottoms a smidge to reveal a C-section scar above her pelvic bone. A post shared by Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@si_swimsuit) The photo feature was done in collaboration with pregnancy and postpartum brand Frida Mom, the first brand to partner with Sports Illustrated Swimsuit under its Pay With Change advertising platform. In a statement, Frida Mom founder Chelsea Hirschhorn said the partnership provides a “valuable platform to disrupt the traditional narrative around women’s bodies — especially those they feature who are mothers.” In her Instagram post of the photo, Hughes, who delivered her son via cesarean three years ago, shared her complicated feelings about her C-section scar. “I struggled with insecurities from my scar being that I’m a model and my incredibly difficult recovery but it wasn’t until I embraced my scar that I experienced the true power in it,” she wrote. According to the latest research from the World Health Organization, births by C-section continue to rise globally, now accounting for more than 1 in 5 (21%) of all childbirths. In the U.S., nearly a third of people who give birth now deliver babies via cesarean section. Despite how common the procedure is, many people are left with guilt or shame after having a C-section, especially if their intention going in was to have a vaginal delivery. As Sports Illustrated notes on its site, “the cultural misconception of labeling C-sections as ‘the easy way out’” doesn’t help matters. Then there’s the body shame many feel about their visible scars, even years later, said Carla Korn, a psychotherapist and body image expert in Westlake Village, California. “So many women feel uncomfortable about their scars being on display and make attempts to hide them,” she told HuffPost. Korn thinks seeing a C-section scar in Sports Illustrated “helps send the message to postpartum women that their scar is nothing to be ashamed of.” For male readers coming across the photo, Korn thinks the message conveyed is just as powerful. (Though if they’re familiar with the newer, more inclusive Swimsuit edition ― “Woke Illustrated,” as some have called it ― they probably won’t be too surprised to see it.) “I think the photo shows that women’s bodies are uniquely capable and magical, especially in how we grow babies and give birth,” she said. “Our bodies’ diversity and perceived imperfections make them even more beautiful.” Melissa Weinberg, a psychotherapist in private practice who specializes in the treatment of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, especially during pregnancy and in the postpartum period, loves that the magazine is normalizing postpartum bodies. Still, she wishes the publication had pushed even further. “It’s certainly a step in the right direction, but it’s hard to get too excited about photos that completely reinforce every other aspect of unhelpful and unachievable beauty ideals that makes most women, including postpartum women, feel like garbage,” she told HuffPost. As nice as the photo is, it doesn’t do much to disrupt the norm of “thin white cis blond women” being revered for their beauty, she added. “Will this be the new standard of how postpartum bodies should look? Will a woman who in most ways looks nothing like this model, aside from their shared C-section scars, feel even worse about her postpartum body in comparison?” she asked. “These photos are really cool, but not enough,” she added. “We need more diversity and inclusivity.” That being noted, Weinberg said it’s always refreshing to see C-sections normalized. “I hope that these photos send the message to anyone viewing them, men included, that C-sections and the marks they leave are unbelievably common and not something to be hidden, but celebrated, something as normal as freckles,” she said. “As a society we want to ignore the details ― glorious and gory ― of such a normal part of the human experience: childbirth.” On social media, the glossy photo has elicited a range of emotions for women who have had C-sections themselves. Some are happily surprised to see scars like theirs shown in the pages of Sports Illustrated. Others have noted that their scars aren’t quite as subtle as Hughes’ due to a “classic” vertical incision rather than a side-to-side “bikini cut,” or that they healed weirdly. Way to go Sports Illustrated, some of us have that scar https://t.co/W5T8T7IVlD Amanda Kammarada, an artist and author who had two C-sections, in 2009 and 2012, was so happy to see the photos featured in a NowThis video, she tweeted it out to her followers. “It made me feel proud of my scar,” she told HuffPost. “Seeing that kind of representation in that type of magazine is a really big deal.” If the picture chips away at the stigma associated with C-sections even slightly, Kammarada said she’s happy. “There are some who say that a C-section isn’t really ‘giving birth,’” she said. “A woman’s body is incredible and there should be no shame in how you have your child.” Senior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost"
8,Russian Threats Push Finland Toward Joining NATO Alliance,environment," KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Finland’s leaders Thursday came out in favor of applying to join NATO, and Sweden could do the same within days, in a historic realignment on the continent 2 1/2 months after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine sent a shiver of fear through Moscow’s neighbors. The Kremlin reacted by warning it will be forced to take retaliatory “military-technical” steps. On the ground, meanwhile, Russian forces pounded areas in central, northern and eastern Ukraine, including the last pocket of resistance in Mariupol, as part its offensive to take the industrial Donbas region, while Ukraine recaptured some towns and villages in the northeast. The first war-crimes trial of a Russian soldier since the start of the conflict is set to open Friday in Kyiv. A 21-year-old captured member of a tank unit is accused of shooting to death a civilian on a bicycle during the opening week of the war. Finland’s president and prime minister announced that the Nordic country should apply right away for membership in NATO, the military defense pact founded in part to counter the Soviet Union. “You (Russia) caused this. Look in the mirror,” Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said this week. While the country’s Parliament still has to weigh in, the announcement means Finland is all but certain to apply — and gain admission — though the process could take months to complete. Sweden, likewise, is considering putting itself under NATO’s protection. That would represent a major change in Europe’s security landscape: Sweden has avoided military alliances for more than 200 years, while Finland adopted neutrality after its defeat by the Soviets in World War II. Public opinion in both nations shifted dramatically in favor of NATO membership after the invasion, which stirred fears in countries along Russia’s flank that they could be next. Such an expansion of the alliance would leave Russia surrounded by NATO countries in the Baltic Sea and the Arctic and would amount to a stinging setback for Putin, who had hoped to divide and roll back NATO in Europe but is instead seeing the opposite happen. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said the alliance would welcome Finland and Sweden with open arms. Russia’s Foreign Ministry warned that Moscow “will be forced to take retaliatory steps of military-technical and other characteristics in order to counter the emerging threats to its national security.” NATO’s funneling of weapons and other military support to Ukraine already has been critical to Kyiv’s surprising success in stymieing the invasion, and the Kremlin warned anew in chilling terms Thursday that the aid could lead to direct conflict between NATO and Russia. “There is always a risk of such conflict turning into a full-scale nuclear war, a scenario that will be catastrophic for all,” said Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council. While Russia’s advance in the Donbas has been slow, its forces have gained some ground and taken some villages. Four civilians were killed Thursday in three communities in the Donetsk region, which is part of the Donbas, the regional governor reported. Britain’s Defense Ministry said Russia’s focus on the Donbas has left its remaining troops around the northeastern city of Kharkiv vulnerable to counterattack from Ukrainian forces, which recaptured several towns and villages around the city. Russian strikes Thursday killed at least two civilians on the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, local authorities said. The attacks also damaged a building housing a humanitarian aid unit, municipal offices and hospital facilities, Vyacheslav Zadorenko, the mayor of the suburban town of Derhachi, wrote in a Telegram post. None of the sites “had anything to do with military infrastructure,” Zadorenko said. Fighting across the east has driven many thousands of Ukrainians from their homes. “It is terrible there now. We were leaving under missiles,” said Tatiana Kravstova, who left the town of Siversk with her 8-year-old son Artiom on a bus headed for the central city of Dnipro. “I don’t know where they were aiming, but they were pointing at civilians.” Ukraine also said Russian forces had fired artillery and grenade launchers at Ukrainian troops around Zaporizhzhia, which has been a refuge for civilians fleeing Mariupol, and attacked in the Chernihiv and Sumy regions to the north. Overnight airstrikes near Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, killed at least three people, Ukraine’s military said. It said that Russian troops fired rockets at a school and student dormitory in Novhorod-Siversky and that some other buildings, including private homes, were also damaged. In his evening address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the assaults. “Of course, the Russian state is in such a state that any education only gets in its way. But what can be achieved by destroying Ukrainian schools? All Russian commanders who give such orders are simply sick and incurable.” Noting that Thursday is International Nurses Day, Zelenskyy said the Russian military had damaged 570 medical facilities since the invasion began on Feb. 24 and fully destroyed 101 hospitals. Twelve Russian missiles struck an oil refinery and other infrastructure in the central Ukrainian industrial hub of Kremenchuk on Thursday, the region’s acting governor, Dmytro Lunin, wrote in a Telegram post. In early April, he said, the refinery, which had been the last fully functional one in Ukraine at the time, was knocked offline by an attack. In the southern port of Mariupol, which has largely been reduced to smoking rubble with little food, water or medicine, or what the mayor called a “medieval ghetto,” Ukrainian fighters continued to hold out at the Azovstal steel plant, the last stronghold of resistance in the city. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said negotiations were underway with Russia to win the release of 38 severely wounded Ukrainian defenders from the plant. She said Ukraine hoped to exchange them for 38 “significant” Russian prisoners of war. ___ Yesica Fisch in Bakhmut, David Keyton in Kyiv, Yuras Karmanau in Lviv, Mstyslav Chernov in Kharkiv, Jari Tanner in Helsinki, and other AP staffers around the world contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine"
9,Rob Reiner Confirms Sequel To 'This Is Spinal Tap' Is In The Works,environment," Senior Reporter, HuffPost After nearly 40 years, the classic 1984 movie “This Is Spinal Tap” is getting a sequel. Dateline is reporting that the spoof heavy-metal band created by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer will be making a comeback in a sequel to the mockumentary called “Spinal Tap II.” Sadly, it looks like the number in the title is meant to be a “2,” and not the number “11,” which looms large in the band’s legend, as you can see from this clip from the first movie. Rob Reiner will direct the movie as well as reprise his role as doofus documentarian Marty DiBergi. He told Deadline that he was constantly asked about whether there would ever be a sequel to the film but said that he and his collaborators came up with the right approach only recently. “You don’t want to just do it to do it. You want to honor the first one and push it a little further with the story,” he said. Reiner noted that Guest, McKean and Shearer have performed as Spinal Tap all over the world but “haven’t spent any time together recently, and that became the premise.” He said the plot will center on the death of longtime manager Ian Faith, played in the film by Tony Hendra. “Ian’s widow inherited a contract that said Spinal Tap owed them one more concert. She was basically going to sue them if they didn’t,” Reiner explained. “All these years and a lot of bad blood we’ll get into, and they’re thrown back together and forced to deal with each other and play this concert.” Reiner said there might be some cameos from famous musicians in the film and added that band might also do a book dedicated to the experiences of real-life rockers that parallel the incidents in the movie. “Like in the movie, they get stoned and can’t find the stage, that happened to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,” Reiner said. The new film will be released March 19, 2024, or 40 years and 17 days after the original’s world premiere. Of course, Twitter users had thoughts. Please call it This Was Spinal Tap https://t.co/I25dabJg6R reminder that the actors did the DVD commentary of the original spinal tap in character; it essentially functions as a half sequel https://t.co/Hkj5DexMUc My prediction for Spinal Tap 2022: One member will grapple with the band’s history of misogyny in a post-MeToo world, another will be a “keep politics out of music” guy, and the third will be obsessed with NFTs. https://t.co/P6qolCG5xw And, of course, someone quoted one of the film’s lines.

10,"In Drought-Ravaged California, Water Use Is Up Dramatically",environment," SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Californian’s drought is worsening and yet residents used more water in March than any month since 2015, defying pleas for conservation from Gov. Gavin Newsom and other authorities, state officials announced Tuesday. Water usage jumped nearly 19% in March, which was one of the driest months on record. Newsom last summer asked residents to voluntarily cut water use by 15%. He encouraged people to water their yards less often, run dishwashers less and install more efficient appliances. The state’s conservation rate gradually increased, aided by some intense fall and early winter storms that reduced water demand. But the first three months of 2022 have been some of the driest ever recorded. Water use increased slightly in January and February before exploding in March when compared to 2020 figures. Since July, the state has cut its overall water use by just 3.7%. Newsom responded to the news by pledging to spend an extra $26 million on water conservation programs, in addition to the $190 million he proposed in January. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced residents and businesses would have to reduce outdoor landscape watering from three days per week to two. Irrigation makes up 35% of the city’s water use. A series of April storms have improved things slightly since March. Still, most of the state’s reservoirs are well below their historic averages. Those reservoirs rely on melting snow to fill up for the dry summer months but the statewide snowpack was at just 27% of its historic average as of April 1."

12,Everybody Clap! Endangered Seal Species Hits Comeback Milestone,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost One of the world’s most endangered seal species has some flippin’ good news. The population of Hawaiian monk seals, an animal found in the wild only in Hawaii, has surpassed 1,500 seals, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced this week. That’s higher than their numbers have been in more than 20 years, which is good news not only for them, but for the environment as a whole. “If we have healthy monk seals, we know that the ecosystem that is supporting those animals is healthy and thriving,” Michelle Barbieri, lead scientist with the NOAA’s monk seal research program, told The Associated Press. The expressive-faced creatures are up against a slew of threats. A big one is habitat loss caused by climate change, as rising sea levels swallow up the low-lying landmasses where the seals live. Other dangers include getting tangled up in fishing nets and other marine debris, eating harmful trash like fishing hooks, diseases, disturbances from human activity on beaches, and even some people intentionally killing them. “We are out there ourselves and working with partners to conduct life-saving interventions for seals, prioritizing females, which are going to go on to create the future generation of seals,” Barbieri told the AP. “We’re starting to really see that continued payoff of intervening to save animals’ lives.” In the Hawaiian language, monk seals are called ilio-holo-i-ka-uaua, which translates to “dog running in the rough water.” The marine mammals can grow between 6 and 7 feet long and weigh 400-600 pounds, feeding on a wide array of fish, octopus, squid, crustaceans and eels. On occasion, those eels cause their own kind of trouble, sometimes getting stuck in seals’ noses. Thankfully, all the seals the NOAA has encountered with this highly specific problem have been OK in the end. Assignment editor, HuffPost"
13,Elephant's 'Excellent Mothering Skills' Help Rare Twins Defy The Odds To Survive,environment," Assignment editor, HuffPost A pair of elephant twins experts weren’t sure would survive are alive and well thanks to the dedication and skill of their mother. The twins, one male and one female, were born in January to a mother named Bora at Samburu National Reserve in Kenya. At the time, the nonprofit Save the Elephants ― which has researchers working in the park and also collaborates with local guides to monitor the animals ― expressed cautious hope about the twins’ future. Twins are rare among elephants and their survival can be dicey. Famed biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough previously called the task of raising elephant twins “almost impossible” because calves “need so much milk and care.” But more than four months later, Bora’s babies are “tiny but still doing well,” Save the Elephants spokesperson Jane Wynyard told HuffPost in an email. “Miraculously Bora has managed to keep her babies alive against all odds and through a fierce drought,” she said. “It’s still early days for the twins and they will rely on their mother’s milk until they’re over 2 years old. However, their survival so far is testament to Bora’s excellent mothering skills and the resilience of elephants.” The twins were spotted late last month and can be seen with Bora and the herd in a video on the nonprofit’s Facebook page.

14,A New Trump-Tied PAC Has Entered The Right-Wing War Against Biden’s Conservation Goals,environment," Environment Reporter, HuffPost A new political action committee run by two former Trump administration officials is marking its territory in a disinformation-rich campaign against the Biden administration’s goal of conserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030, known informally as “30x30.” Sagebrush Rebellion PAC, named after the anti-government Sagebrush Rebellion movement that started in the 1970s and sought to remove lands from federal control, quietly surfaced late last year. It has deep connections to Trumpworld and has joined a growing coalition of right-wing organizations and elected officials sowing fear in rural communities with false, conspiratorial claims about how Biden’s government is planning to confiscate private property or use deceptive tactics to gain control of private land to meet the 30x30 target. On its cowboy-heavy website, Sagebrush Rebellion boasts of being “made up of grassroots fighters who are not beholden to Washington’s inner circles” and says it is “committed to gutting incompetent and corrupt leaders from the political process.” Its priorities include dismantling federal land management agencies and transferring control of federal lands to the states, as well as a laundry list of fossil fuel-centric energy policies that looks like something pulled directly from an oil and gas trade group’s website. The PAC’s donations page urges people to “help us start a rebellion.” It sells T-shirts, mugs and other merchandise that feature a cow skull and the phrase “Let’s Go Brandin’,” a cowboy twist on a popular conservative phrase meaning “Fuck Joe Biden.” Internet archives show that in 2015 the website URL that Sagebrush Rebellion PAC is now using featured a post titled “Simple Wisdom of Cliven Bundy,” the notorious Nevada rancher who led an armed standoff with federal agents in 2014 over unpaid grazing fees. As HuffPost reported this story, the PAC and a film company it is working with on a documentary purged their social media accounts of specific posts in the exact order that HuffPost inquired about them. As of March 31, the fledgling PAC had received only $200 in contributions, according to its most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. But it recently started forging relationships with some of the biggest players in the anti-30x30 push. The PAC sponsored last month’s “STOP 30x30 Summit” in Lincoln, Nebraska. On Twitter, the group has parroted the anti-30x30 movement’s sweeping, evidence-free claim that the 30x30 target is a federal “land grab” in disguise. The greatest conservationists in the country are farmers & ranchers. The Biden Administration has declared war on their private property rights with its dismal 30x30 land grab. Let the power over land remain in the hands of the people who work it, not bureaucrats. #Stop30x30 The group is based in Casper, Wyoming, and led by Rockefeller heiress and Donald Trump loyalist Catharine P. O’Neill, the daughter of major Republican donor George O’Neill Jr. She worked at both the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Trump administration and is a regular contributor to far-right news outlet Newsmax. Trump 2024 pic.twitter.com/e2LfJ4cBWc Christian Whiton, a former adviser to the Trump and George W. Bush administrations, is the PAC’s ​​director of communications. O’Neill and Whiton have both peddled baseless claims about fraud in the 2020 election and questioned the legitimacy of Biden’s presidency. On a leaked call with USAID staff two days after Biden was announced the winner, O’Neill declared that “the election is still happening” and “the Electoral College has not voted yet.” And on Jan. 6, 2021, after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to thwart certification of the 2020 election, O’Neill went on Twitter to proclaim her alliance to Trump and condemn those not standing behind him. I have been with President @realDonaldTrump since the beginning and will stand with him until the end.To my colleagues in the Administration who are not doing the same: your masks are off, we see you, we will remember you. #2022 Along with sponsoring last month’s “Stop 30x30 Summit,” Sagebrush Rebellion PAC has teamed up with an Arizona-based production company, J Infinite Digital Media, to produce some sort of documentary starring the leading figures of the anti-30x30 movement. In a now-deleted post on Instagram, J Infinite shared pictures of the production company and Sagebrush Rebellion PAC filming at last month’s event. “An amazing production day with @sagebrushrebellion on their latest doc project,” read the post, which included pictures of film production and an interview with Margaret Byfield, executive director of American Stewards of Liberty, a fringe right-wing property rights group in Texas that organized the summit and is leading the fight against 30x30. Jackson Carter of Sagebrush Rebellion was tagged in the post. The post also featured Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), one of the summit’s keynote speakers, and Utah state Rep. Phil Lyman (R), who was convicted in 2015 of leading anti-federal land protesters on an illegal ATV ride on public lands that were off limits to off-road vehicles. Trump later pardoned Lyman’s federal misdemeanor conviction. J Infinite removed the Instagram post within a couple hours of HuffPost contacting Sagebrush Rebellion PAC about it. Accountable.US, a watchdog group, first alerted HuffPost to Sagebrush Rebellion PAC and its forthcoming documentary project. “When it comes to American Stewards of Liberty, you can almost hear the black helicopters circling,” Jordan Schreiber, energy and environment director at Accountable.US, told HuffPost in an email. She noted that the group’s leaders have compared 30x30 to Nazi Germany and the Holodomor, a human-caused famine that occurred in Ukraine during Soviet dictator Josef Stalin’s rule that resulted in the deaths of an estimated 3.9 million people. “This is what we are up against in the fight to preserve American land and water for future generations to enjoy,” Schreiber said. The documentary project appears to be far and away the biggest job this little-known film outfit has landed. A review of J Infinite’s website indicates its specialty is filming and photographing people shooting and posing with guns. Two of its main clients are tactical training facilities in Arizona, one of which J Infinite’s owner Jacob Fuchs also works for. Fuchs seems to have some sort of affiliation with or affinity for the Boogaloo Bois, an often violent far-right, anti-government movement that has warned of and even plotted a future civil war. Members often sport Hawaiian shirts and military-style gear. Last June, J Infinite released a nearly three-minute, slow-motion video titled “Da Bois,” featuring Fuchs and two other men in tactical gear shooting assault-style rifles and handguns and fist-bumping to The Chords’ song “Sh-Boom.” Vests worn by Fuchs and another man feature patches that read “BOOG CREW.” Another similar video posted on the company’s YouTube channel is titled “Boogaloo Crew Pilot.” Two days after the anti-30x30 summit in Nebraska, Sagebrush Rebellion posted a picture on Twitter of what appears to be Fuchs in a Hawaiian shirt with the caption, “Behind the scenes…stay tuned!” Neither J Infinite nor Sagebrush Rebellion PAC responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment about the documentary they are working on or the production company’s Boogaloo-themed videos. A series of emails to Joshua Abernathy, whose address is listed on the PAC’s filings with the FEC, garnered only a brief reply: “I am no longer working on that project.” After HuffPost reached out to J Infinite, the company deleted its Boogaloo-themed content from YouTube, took down its website and made its Instagram page private. And immediately after HuffPost asked if the man pictured in the Hawaiian shirt was Fuchs, Sagebrush Rebellion took down the post and blocked this reporter on Twitter. It is unclear how Fuchs and his company went from filming Boogaloo-themed target practices to a documentary for a PAC run by former Trump administration officials, or to what extent American Stewards of Liberty is involved in the project. Byfield did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. American Stewards is largely responsible for the false narrative about 30x30 being a government land grab. The organization was formed in 2009, but it has its roots in the anti-government Sagebrush Rebellion movement. One of its precursors, Stewards of the Range, was established in 1992 to defend Byfield’s father, Nevada rancher and sagebrush rebel Wayne Hage, who battled with the Forest Service for years over unpermitted grazing on public lands — a prequel of sorts to the Bundy standoff that gave rise to an extremist militia movement. Byfield has worked to distance her organization from the Sagebrush Rebellion and the Bundy family. In a June 2021 email to a Nebraska reporter, which HuffPost obtained as part of a public records request, Byfield wrote that her group “was founded in the 1990s so we couldn’t have had an association with the sagebrush rebellion” and that her father “was not part of the sagebrush rebellion.” She also said American Stewards has never been associated with Bundy. Yet Byfield allowed a PAC named after the Sagebrush Rebellion that shares the movement’s anti-federal land ideology to sponsor and film an anti-30x30 summit that she called “the most important conference” her group has ever organized. And Trent Loos, a Nebraska rancher and radio show host who served on Trump’s agricultural advisory committee and now helps American Stewards with its anti-30x30 campaign, conducted a sympathetic interview with Bundy’s son, Ammon Bundy, during the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. In closing remarks at last month’s summit in Nebraska, which HuffPost obtained a recording of, Byfield took a moment to thank and recognize the event’s sponsors. “Catharine O’Neill, the Sagebrush Rebellion,” Byfield said to the audience. “Have you guys been doing any interviews with Catharine? She’s set up in the media room.” Environment Reporter, HuffPost"
15,Ukraine's Scientists Keep Working In Defiance Of Russian Invasion,environment," Anton Vlaschenko often hears shelling outside his office in Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv, not far from the front lines of the war. He sometimes even sees smoke rising from Russian tanks hit by missiles. But the 40-year-old zoologist continues his work, dissecting and labeling bat tissue, as he probes the disease ecology of the flying mammals. When news of the war overwhelms him, he says, it helps to have something familiar to do with his hands. He also sees it as an act of defiance. “Our staying in Ukraine, our continuing to work — it’s some kind of resistance of Russian invasion,” Vlaschenko said via Zoom, a barrage of shelling audible in the background. “The people together in Ukraine are ready to fight, not only with guns. We don’t want to lose our country.” His resolve isn’t unique. Like other Ukrainians whose labors aren’t essential to the war effort, the scientists and academics want to continue their important work where they can. A common refrain is that they want to stay connected to their scholarly community, which provides a shard of normalcy amid the chaos and violence, and “keep the light of Ukrainian science and humanities alive,” said Yevheniia Polishchuk, who teaches at Kyiv National Economic University. As vice chair of the Young Scientists Council at Ukraine’s Ministry of Education and Science, Polishchuk organized an online survey of academics to assess their situation and needs after the Feb. 24 invasion. An estimated 4,000 to 6,000 scholars had left Ukraine by early April — mostly women with families — but about 100,000 stayed. Most who went abroad wound up in Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, getting temporary positions at European institutions. Some scientists have received grants from the Polish Academy of Sciences, U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and other organizations. Polishchuk, now in Krakow with her children and husband, is a visiting professor at a university for May and June but says she hopes to return to Kyiv when fighting stops. “We don’t want the war to result in a brain drain from Ukraine,” she said. While Ukrainian scholars are appealing to international scientific bodies for assistance — including remote work opportunities and access to journals, datasets, archives and other materials — there is also a will to prevent the war from permanently sapping talent and momentum from the country’s academic and professional ranks, which will be needed to rebuild after fighting stops. “Most of our scholars do not want to move abroad permanently; they want to stay in Ukraine,” Polishchuk said. Shortly after the war began, Ivan Slyusarev, a 34-year-old astronomer, helped the director of Kharkiv National University’s observatory move computers, monitors and other materials into the basement, which had sheltered equipment and historical artifacts when Nazi forces occupied the city during World War II. The observatory’s main telescope is located in a field in Russia-occupied territory, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Kharkiv on the road to Donetsk. Slyusarev said he doesn’t know its condition, but thinks Ukrainian forces blew up a nearby bridge to stop the Russian advance. He is relying on scientists outside Ukraine to continue his work. Astronomers in the Czech Republic have sent him observational data from their telescope so he can keep analyzing the properties of metallic asteroids. He also can see data from a small robotic telescope in Spain’s Canary Islands. He operates mostly from a home office on the outskirts of Kharkiv. Slyusarev, who says he became an astronomer because of “romantic” ideas about the stars, finds refuge in scientific discovery. Astronomy “produces only positive news” and is a welcome respite from daily life, he said. “It’s very important in wartime,” he added. After the war started, theoretical physicist and astronomer Oleksiy Golubov left Kharkiv to join his parents in Batkiv, a village in western Ukraine. Although the buildings of the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology were “bombed and shelled and virtually destroyed,” Golubov said, the school continues to offer some remote classes. He has been keeping in touch with students online — in Kharkiv, in western Ukraine and in Poland and Germany. The 36-year-old scientist is also a coordinator and trainer for the Ukrainian students preparing to compete in the International Physicists Tournament, a competition for tackling unsolved physics problems that is being held in Colombia this month. The students, who had been training online, met this week in Lviv for the first time — following train journeys delayed by the war. “We still want to take part and prove that even inconveniences like war can’t stop us from doing good science and having a good education,” he said. Golubov, who was turned down from joining the military because of a paralyzed hand, submitted a paper in March to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics and wrote in the acknowledgements, “We are grateful to Ukrainians who are fighting to stop the war so that we can safely finish the revision of this article.” Some scholars, like Ivan Patrilyak, dean of the history department at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, have enlisted. Eighteen months ago, he was hosting a speaker series on the legacy of World War II and lecturing about the Holocaust. Now, he’s with a territorial defense unit in Kyiv. Igor Lyman, a historian at the State Pedagogical University in Berdyansk, had to flee when Russian forces occupied the port city early in the war. Before leaving, he had seen the troops break into dormitories to interrogate students and order administrators to teach in Russian, rather than Ukrainian, and use a Moscow-approved curriculum. He said the directors “refused and resigned.” He later settled in a camp for internally displaced persons at Chernivtsi National University, living in a dormitory with academics from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kherson and other cities. “Each of these families has its own terrible story of war,” he wrote in an email. “And everyone, like me, dreams of our victory and coming back home.” He said the Russian forces “are doing everything they can to impose their propaganda.” Vlaschenko, the Kharkiv zoologist, wanted to protect 20 bats in his care from the shelling, so he carried them to his home, a walk of about an hour. It also helped to preserve his valuable research, which couldn’t be easily replaced, even if buildings and labs can be rebuilt after the war. “All the people who decided to stay in Kharkiv agreed to play this dangerous and potentially deadly lottery,” he said, “because you never know in what areas a new rocket or new shell would hit.” As he scrambles to record data and safeguard his rare samples, he sees it as part of his mission — “not only for us, but also for science in general.” The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.
