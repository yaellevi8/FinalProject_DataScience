NPA 21 Lakh Crore Paytm the Biggest IPO of Tech Company is trading at 70% discounts, this indicates either Pricing is wrong or Market is Collapsing. LIC IPO Pricing biggest scam. Who destroyed LIC value. Once best company, suddenly lost its value. The report card of Indian IPO is extremely poor. Most of IPO's go burst and many companies go missing after IPO. Reality of today's market is, The BSE Index is driven by Few Heavy Weight Companies. 80% of listed companies are trading at very low prices. India's Growth is down and Economy is suffering with many Challenges. Unemployment rate at 40 years high. Bottom-line is extremely bad. The market does not represent reality. India is categorized as poor country, underdeveloped country. India is no more developing country. What will make India's Stock Market Crash Why Market Is Ready to Crash Average Life of Big Bull in India is 9 Years. This is how the crash comes. NSE CEO Scandal India Market is Artificially High The crash of Corona, thousands died, and economy stopped but market remain going up. The market does not represent reality of economy. Market is driven by few heavy weight of Index. This is reason market is prop-up artificially. Even though India's Savings is going down. Per capita income is going down, and Debt is increasing, in this situation market is ready for crash. Where is the Bottom My Opinion BSE Sensex 24,000 is bottom.   Hate will Bring Crash Crash of BSE Sensex  Bottom is 24000 Do anybody know? Do RBI know, how is hidden? No stress tests, lax regulation and no real action, making India's Financial System vulnerable.It can collapse any time. RBI relaxed reporting of NPA twice during the tenure of present RBI governor, Mr. Shaktikanta Das, who is brought in to implement Government Policy of Easy Money. After collapse of ILFS and its restructuring, still no real action is taken on other similar companies. Really no one knows, how much is NPA. I can list few numbers Mudra Loan - How much total loan is issued and how much is recovered. How NPA is calculated or not accounted at all. What is default rate. Total Mudra loan is 18.75 Lakh, these loans are given to Micro, and Small Business. These are small loans, default is very high. No one really knows how much provisions are taken. In my opinion 75% loans will default, so banks have huge NPA.  These are three categories which will have maximum effect of slow down. Almost 100 Billion USD loan is given to Real Estate Companies. 18% is sever stress, 12% is stressed according to government data, which is a year most. These stressed are calculated according to relaxed norm. The loans to construction sector, specially PPP Road Projects are under stressed. This is huge amount. There is not much Data on it is available. But looking at Road Projects, Power Projects and Infrastructure Projects carried out during all ten years, this number is very high. The projects are delayed, economy contracted severely during Covid and yet to recover. Economy will remain slow, very slow. This will have pressure of Projects. The cash flow will remain negative and within next two quarter they will be NPA. India is one of Country where Individual Borrowers are not protected ? There is no Bankruptcy Protection for Individual Borrowers. There is no law which protects Individual Borrowers. Increased unemployment, job losses during last three years has created havoc among families.  They have sold their Gold, Jewelry, and liquid assets to fulfill the obligations. This is huge numbers. Savings is going down, it is reduced by almost 5%, this means common man is getting poor.  Banks will not have enough cash to lend and this will slow down economy. NPA of Manufacturing, Power and Industrial Sectors - This sector will have huge impact of slow down. The 1% slow down of economy will make at-least  12% debts NPA. What is the Size of NPA? If Stressed Test is Carried Out and the Standards defined by Ex RBI Governor is taken into Account, NPA is above 52 Lakh Crore, which is at least 3 times higher than projected. Does Government has Capacity and Does RBI has tools to handle it. Not Really. Do You Remember the India has to Plane Load of Gold to UK to Barrow money, then PM, Mr. Chandra Shekhar has to take this painful decision. Yes, India is fast approaching BoP Crisis. Oil is above $100 a Barrel for more than 3 months now. The prices were above $80 for almost six months. The prices will remain in high for coming months, war is just started and there is no indicator that it is going to stop any time soon. Anything above $70 a barrel is more than enough to derail India's BoP. Oil Prices may not be only thing responsible for this situation. Commodity Prices - India is net importer of Edible Oil and other Grains and Animal Feed. The rise of prices will bring stress on Indian Rupee and increase inflation. The metal is another commodity is giving India hard time, it will bring slow down to economy. India is Facing multiple Stress on Rupee. Rising interest rate and Quantitative Tightening by Fed will bring nightmare for Indian Market. Slowing Global Economy, reduced Export and Increased Imports will definitely has big Challenge for Indian Economy. Reduced Savings - Saving is Reduced to 30% which is lowest in last 15 years and household savings is down from 23% in 2012 to 18% in 2022. This is big Fall. This is indicator of another things, banks does not have enough money lend, they will have less money to lend. Specially Individual savings are down by 5% means cost of living is very high, and common man can't save and many of them used gold and jewelry to survive. The slowdown in Global Economy Slowing down of Global Economy and High Input Prices will increase stress in Indian Economy. The Dollar Debt will face huge repayment challenge. The market will face real challenge when no investment will dry up. Energy Crisis, no electricity, coal crisis and commodities, these all are cocktail which is not easy for India to handle. Stress is already in system, NPA rising and RBI does not have tools to handle it. India can Face Default on its Repayment of Dollar Debt. India's Banking Sector is very stressed and vulnerable. It is nightmare for banking. Banks are closing branches, reducing staff to keep going, reduced cost. Because savings are low, so lending will be low, and high default, all this can bring Banking sector to knees. Central Bank of India will close 600 Branches The Merger of HDFC Bank and HDFC Housing Finance - This to reduce cost. Because assets are stressed. The real problem is no one want to talk truth and take actions.

1,Crusader With a Camera: Lewis W. Hine,politics," Coal Miners-Breaker Boys Twelve-Year-Old Working Cotton Mill Born Lewis Wickes Hine on September 26, 1874, to Douglas and Sarah Hine in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Lewis went on to study at the University of Chicago, Columbia University, and New York University. As a teacher, he began encouraging his students to use photography to document their studies. On several occasions, he took his sociology class to Ellis Island to document immigrants as they were being admitted to America. Lewis became overwhelmed and at that point realized he needed to photograph the realities of child labor, tenement living, and the immigrant's hardships. Lewis left his teaching position and began working for the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC), and spent the next decade documenting abuses of child labor. He was aware it was dangerous work and began using disguises. Sometimes he was a fire inspector, a Bible salesman, and even a factory inspector. Being clever and without being obvious, he would measure the children's height by using the buttons on his coat. At this time, children had to be twelve years old to work in factories but there was little  Oyster Shuckers Spinner, Cotton Mill 1908 Glass Factory Boys Between 1880-1900, children ages five to ten worked in coal mines, cotton mills, canning factories, and selling newspapers on the street. They worked 10-14 hours per day in poor conditions with no heat or air conditioning, using sharp tools—all the time suffering abuse from their bosses. Accidents were common primarily due to their age. These children were in the web of poverty along with their families. They would forever lose their childhood and education often; they would suffer disabilities lasting their lifetime. With photographs being published in the newspapers, the public became aware of the atrocities of children. In his lifetime, Lewis traveled over 50,000 miles photographing child labor, immigrants' poor conditions, and the building of the Empire State Building. Lewis risked his life photographing the steel workers. He worked in a unique basket 1000 feet above Fifth Avenue. He told reporters later he hung above with nothing below but a sheer drop of a quarter mile. Lewis went on to work for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). In 1936 he was selected as a photographer for the National Research Project of the Works Project. However, the public grew concerned about other problems in their lives, and funding was drying up. Lewis' funds were severely distressed, and he lost his home and filed for unemployment. He was so broke that when his wife died in 1919, he could not pay for her funeral and had to rely on her family to cover burial expenses. Hine died a year later alone and destitute, but what he accomplished will forever be a part of history. He had dedicated his life to documenting the problems of the American people. Lewis is considered one of the most influential photographers of the 20th century. Without his powerful photos, child labor might not have shown the public the wrongs of child labor. Lewis and his wife are buried in Ouleoat ValleyCemetery, New York.  Child Lost Arm at Cotton Mill Workers on Empire State Bldg Ellis Island Immigrants In 1904 the National Child Labor Act was established, yet it took another thirty years before laws were put in place. And the official Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was law. Today, agricultural workers lag behind the rules. They can work at age twelve with no limits on overtime and no benefits. The restrictions do not apply if they are working on a family farm. In 1916, the Keating-Owen Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Wilson. However, in 1918, the Supreme Court determined it to be unconstitutional because it overstepped government power to regulate interstate commerce. Thankfully, the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) changed that. Parts of the Act limited the age of boys to 16 and girls to 18. 1904 Child Labor Committee Photographs taken by Lewis W.

2,"King George III Was Actually Not A Tyrant, And Your Textbooks Are Wrong",politics," Caston George is a 10-year veteran political professional and former politician, accomplished writer, researcher, author, and archivist. The Story of America’s Most Recent Officially Recognised Monarch Changes Depending On Your Side of the Atlantic. It is said that the mirror is one that has two faces, and that to look at one’s reflection all depends upon light; that light, the direction that light is coming from, casts shadow, and how that shadow falls wholly depends upon the three-pointed postulate of the subject, and the onlooker, and the medium of the mirror itself, bringing to mind the age-old adage that beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder. It fascinates me, as both a Monarchist and an American, how King George III has such a vastly different reflection depending upon which side of the Atlantic Ocean — that vast and reflective mirror of water, that separates — you happened to be viewing him from; what side of the looking glass you happen to fall upon. It also led me to discover just how historic conflicts and age old grudges skew points of view even today, leading to many of my fellow Americans to have a very distorted view of this very misunderstood Monarch. There is no human being alive who is perfect, Scripture tells us, and King George III was no exception to that rule. But the King George III that Americans have come to know as this caricature of historical villainy is not one that’s based in reality or in history, and is resultant of Anti-English propaganda leftover from the US rebellion, and speculative innuendo. Both have come together to create this personified amalgamation of a cartoonish villain so two-dimensional, it brings to mind Snidely Whiplash, the villain from the North American cartoon Dudley Do-Right, the inept but morally virtuous member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who, along with his trusty steed, always ended up saving the day in spite of himself. Snidely Whiplash was a handlebar mustache-twirling, black top hat-wearing villain in a black overcoat that cackled loudly with a “mwhahaha!” as he tied Dudley’s beloved ladyfriend Nell to the railroad tracks (for reasons that I can’t immediately recall, but that I’m sure were as equally ridiculous), and it was up to Dudley to bumble and fumble his way into saving his damsel in distress, which, during every episode, he did — usually through complete accident and sheer dumb luck: “Curses! Foiled again!” would cry Whiplash! If that sounds completely stupid to you, it’s because it is! But it was a fun to watch on Saturday Mornings in America. That is how King George III is portrayed in American schools, in American culture, in American history: two-dimensional, over-the-top, a children’s cartoon villain. But to see this monarch for who and what he truly was, it is important to do two things: First, to examine what Americans have come to believe him to be, and ask ourselves why and how he came to be seen that way; and second, to ever-so-slightly adjust the mirror on King George III, so as to cast light on him from a different angle, show Americans who their last monarch really was, and perhaps do some historical justice to the ruler who some people have come to refer to as ‘The Farmer King’, and on the other side of the ocean, as ‘Mad King George III’. King George III was portrayed as mean, despotic, greedy, effeminate in this “educational” children’s cartoon in the United States. Credit: ‘Schoolhouse Rock!’ video, “No More Kings”. It may (or may not) surprise you that American children are raised by television sets — at school and at home — at what I remember to be a little under 25% of any given week (that number increasing to 50% on Saturday Mornings). I was about eight years old in my third grade elementary (primary) school class when I first saw an edition of the cartoon Schoolhouse Rock! that featured King George III. Schoolhouse Rock! was an “educational” cartoon often shown both on network television as part of their Saturday morning cartoon programming lineup for children, as well as on VHS casette tapes in schools on days when one’s teachers used it as part of the curriculum, or, when they needed extra time to grade papers or prepare future lessons; though dated, even at its time of debut, it featured catchy songs that taught American school children about things like the US Constitution, how bills become laws, the proper use of conjuctive adjectives in sentences (“Oh, conjunction junction, what’s your function?”), and of course, US history. I distinctly remember the video “No More Kings”, the tale of the US settlement and eventual independence from Great Britain. It begins the Pilgrims, casting them as people who just wanted to live a different way of life than England afforded them, and who valiantly crossed an ocean and claimed the land they found as being providentially their’s. The video shockingly does not make mention of the fact that they were the republicans essentially thrown out of England after their bloody and regicidal insurrection against King Charles I, whom they beheaded, after an illegal and kangaroo court tried the King and found him guilty — but in all historical honesty, the King was guilty before he set foot in their courtroom and spoke one word in his own defence. The video also does not mention that the republicans with their Puritan majority in the new “government” made dancing and the celebration of Christmas illegal, closed all of the theatres, forbade the playing of music, and as though they were the Kim Jong’s of their day, pressured everyone to adopt the same, plain black cloaks and belt buckled hats as seemingly the only fashion accessories that were permitted to be sold. In this light, it’s very little wonder why these very same people, less than two centuries later, landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and began accusing their fellow townsfolk of having the Devil himself over for the occasional cup of tea and practicing witchcraft, and proceeded to then burn those found guilty (who were all unfailingly and unsurprisingly also tried and found guilty well before their trials begun) at the stake in the centre of town; or they were subjected to “tests” to determine their witch or non-witch status, the administration of which would by it’s nature prove to be fatal either way, whether they passed the test or failed it. For example, to be thrown into a body of water, and if the accused floated (as human beings do), then the accused was being upheld from below, and was of course then a witch, and would be fished out and killed accordingly. If the accused sank, then the accused was not a witch (though would drown); and if the accused sank, waited a minute or two with held breath, and then swam back up of their own voliton, just to prove their non-witch status? Witch please! They still floated to the top, so it was time to dry of and get ready for a certain “barbeque”. Yeah, those people are the good guys in this particular cartoon! King George III comes in about a minute after the music starts. The first sight of him is that of an effeminate, effete, legs crossed and eyes closed man with a powdered, curly wig under his Crown, a strangely shaped face, and rouge on his cheeks (produced in the 1970’s, this was a thinly veiled attempt at casting the King as a homosexual, which at the time, was something no chilld nor parent in America was taught to believe was noble, heroic, or “okay” to be). The Cartoon subtlely also replaces the Royal Motto of Dieu Et Mon Droit, or, For God and My Country, to “Dieu est Man Dick,” and I don’t think I need to translate that in order for you to figure it out. The formula they were going for here was, “Kings are gay, gays are bad, shun the gays, burn the witch, America rocks!” Every person that I grew up with that I spoke to in preparation for writing this article remembers Schoolhouse Rock! and some can even still remember and even sing the lyrics of the songs with eerie accuracy. They were written to be catchy and we watched these cartoons often. I can’t help wondering, as we’re both about the same age and share a country of birth, if Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, remembers this cartoon as well; and I wonder, too, if she finds it just as ridiculous as I do! The cartoon king throws a childlike tantrum, and insists that the Pilgrims in the video get down on their knees and give full bodied embellished, worshipful bows at the mouth of the ocean, facing in the direction of England, reverencing him from afar; afterward, he is seen peering through his telescope at the Pilgrims from across the ocean, and making a face resembling the Dr Seuss’s Grinch on Christmas Eve, begins plotting to extort money from them, and is later seen sitting upon a pile of bags with “$” marked on them — despite the fact that it would have been “£” either way, let’s not let facts get in the way of a good ol’ fashioned American reimagining of what actually happened! And that’s precisely what I was watching, a reimagining of history. It isn’t just this one cartoon, either. Though infamously inaccurate, the American film entitled The Patriot starring Mel Gibson and Jason Isaacs does not feature a portrayal of King George III personally, but does feature characters sent to America to fight the colonists in the name of the King. Jason Isaacs plays the villain of the film, a man who kills the children of the main character after bullying his family around for seemingly no reason, in front of their farmhouse in the Colony of South Carolina. Isaacs, who also more famously portrayed another villain — Lucius Malfoy, the father of Harry Potter’s school nemesis, Draco, in the Harry Potter film series adapted from the books — brings that same level of “evil” to this character in the Patriot, Colonel Tavington, who dies in dramatic fashion, after a slow motion swordfight amidst the mortar fire and smoke and waving star spangled banners. It’s important that, when watching the film, one remembers that these people were killing the soldiers of the lawful government at the time, sent there in service to their country, and who, by all accounts, were the fellow countrymen of their murderers. The American militia engaged in brutal geurilla tactics that the British Army was not prepared to face — in the film, and in much of what I learned in US history courses, this is seen as a good thing, for it gave the Americans the advantage against them — but in reality, the tactics used by the British Army were considered fair rules of combat, and to depart from those and fight as the Americans did was considered to be cruel; not the way that a gentlemen, or a man with honour, would fight his opponent. Could you imagine if that occured today, in North America? If California were to wish to separate from the US federal government, and Californians engaged in those tactics against the camoflauge-wearing members of the US Army? Not only would the US federal government likely engage in both literal and metaphorical “overkill” but it would be such a heavy handed move that it would dissuade any Californian from ever again questioning the authority of the United States of America — lest they pay the price for it. Compared to today, it makes the British Army look more like UN peacekeepers than villanous stormtroopers. The film does not portray many loyalists to the Crown. Of those that are seen or mentioned, they are depicted as being men whose loyalties are easily bought, of low morality, or who aided the British only because of coercion by Colonel Tavington and his henchmen. Not once is there seen a character making a reasonable, and truly patriotic defence of King and Country: it wouldn’t play into the overall narrative that the British were the “bad guys” if a reasonable argument could be made that the rebellion was perhaps fought in error. Interestingly, it is historical fact that a majority of Colonial British subjects living at the time (it would be incorrect to call them Americans at that point, because they weren’t) actually did not support war with England. In fact, most opposed it. Caught up in the fervor, those numbers of those proudly supporting the King dwindled steadily as the war — fought by a minority of radical separatists — went on, and as they themselves were seen more and more as much the enemy as the red-coated British officers and servicemembers were considered to be. Social pressure was high on the part of the separatists, and as radical words led to radical actions amongst the Colonials, loyalists began to keep their loyalism more in the closet — after all, why wouldn’t they? Their neighbours could come by and burn their house down if they were deemed to be unfriendly to the separatist cause. After the Revolution, those Loyalists who were not pressured into silent submission to their new more local men of power, saw their homes trashed and raided, their possessions robbed, their horses killed, their stables and properties burned to the ground, and many of them were killed, drug through the muddy streets, spat upon, and publicly tarred and feathered. This of course was before the Americans passed their Constitutional amendments that outlawed things like the cruel and unusual punishment that they saw fit to get in just under the clock before ratifying the founding documents of their new nation. The American revolutionaries were the definition of mob control. One of the more legendary US presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who brought the US back from the Great Depression through a series of social democratic programs that literally turned the lights on in places throughout the country that hadn’t even had electricity yet (thank you Tennessee Valley Authority), once said, “Government by organised money is just as dangerous as government by organised mob.” If the public had voted on the US rebellion, and had the vote had actual, actionable consequence to it, the US rebellion would not have been fought at all: the public would have likely given a majority “no” vote to war. The HBO film series John Adams, starring Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney as John and Abigail Adams, gave the most historically accurate portrayal in American media of King George III. Giamatti plays a thoughtful Adams and a reuluctant “founding father” who, while sympathetic to independence, wants independence done the right and proper way — the English way, and often conflicted with his more radically nationalistic pro-separatist peers. Two scenes are shown: the first shows Adams with an emissary from the King on his first visit to London as United States Ambassador to England — the first person to hold that role. The King’s emissary is teaching Adams in the scene, as Abigail looks on, to reverence properly in the presence of His Majesty, the irony of which, given that he had played a notable part in the war against England just the year prior, Abigail is visibly amused by. The next scene is majestic in its simplicity, and its honesty, and shows Giamatti’s Adams meeting, and being accepted as ambassador by, King George III, played by Tom Hardy, who gave a brief, but superb performance in the role of the monarch. The awkwardness is palpable, and the tension so thick it could be cut with a knife, as Adams stutters in his nervousness before the King. After the formalities are dispensed with, Adams says that he considers it to be a “distinguishing honour” to be the first American citizen to stand in the King’s presence, vowing to restore the ties of “the good old nature and good old humour” of their two peoples, whom though now separated from one another, shared “kindred blood” — recognising that they were family. Then, he adds some of his own personal commentary. “Though I have been entrusted by my country, never in my whole life in a manner more agreeable to myself”, says Adams with sincerity; that is to say, he was damned proud and honoured to be standing where he was, and humbled by the Crown. King George, sensing that sincerity, acknowledged the awkwardness of the situation, but, as moved as he could have been given the circumstances, said that he was glad that America had sent Adams, and not someone else, to be his minister of diplomacy on their behalf. One surmises that the King feared a radical separatist sent to London to simply be a diplomatic wreckingball in the King’s Court, and that fear was a real one, as history shows. History also shows that John Adams was instrumental in sowing the seeds that would one day become known as the special relationship between the two countries, a phrase first coined by a future namesake of the late King, King George VI. Not all American portrayals of King George III were negative per se, but they often come with an American twist. In the television series The West Wing, considered one of the more high brow depictions of principled patriots working within the bureaucracy of the White House for a prayerful, progressive, intelligent president, an episode shows the British Ambassador Lord John Marbury (played by the late Roger Rees) speaking about King George’s truly romantic gift for his wife — Queen Charlotte — to a White House staffer, who is moved by the late King’s gesture of commissioning a special musical composition just for her, played on a boat on the River Thames, as the King and Queen watched and listened from a romantic, grassy picnic dinner on the river’s banks (we will return to this point a bit later). “And then we opened up a can of whoop ass on him at Yorktown,” another character promptly chimes in with immediately thereafter — there’s that American twist I told you about: always having to have the last word on the matter of King George and the Revolution. Not to be outdone, Disney came up with their own contribution to the shoddy image of the King, in Pirates of the Carribbean: On Stranger Tides, except historically speaking, their King George was actually King George II, no mention of a distinction is made unless one waits until the credits to discover it. Once again, an alumnus of the Harry Potter film series, the late Richard Griffiths who once played Potter’s mundane (and abusive) Uncle Vernon Dursley, plays King George III’s grandfather and predecessor in the Disney film— is there perhaps some sort of US film industry memo about drafting actors that played Harry Potter villains to play every British villain? Did I miss that? — and again, portrayed while concerns over treasure hunting and money are first and foremost on the King’s mind, as he eats alone at a table stocked with enough food to feed every peasant outside his palace walls for a month, implying greed in ways both spoken and unspoken. The King orders his predictably incompetent guards to seize the film’s antihero pirate protagonist in the latter’s comically dramatic escape from custody and his forced audience with King George II — as though a pirate in custody and clapped in irons would ever be permitted to be in the King’s presence, which of course, in real history, never happened and never would. Some justice was done for King George III in American media this past year, however, if audiences were keen enough to catch it. In the Netflix television series, The Crown, which chronicles the early days of the reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, it is the Americans who were the butt of the joke this time, in the episode entitled, Dear Mrs Kennedy from the show’s second series. US President John F Kennedy and his wife Jaqueline Kennedy, two legendary figures in US political history, bumbled through their introductions and protocols with the Queen and Prince Phillip when they met them at an informal dinner at Buckingham Palace in 1961. But the redemption for King George came from the Queen herself, who, upon taking Mrs Kennedy for a tour of Buckingham Palace, brings the First Lady into magnificent sweeping hall of paintings and portraits; the picture gallery, and the first portrait she points out to Kennedy is that of King Geoge III, the King who Kennedy’s own home country defied in the revolution. In a voice beaming with pride, the Queen names him her great, great, great, great grandfather, and highlights his portrait as the first thing she does when they enter the gallery, mentioning that it was from 1761, when the King bought Buckingham House for his wife, Queen Charlotte. For those of us who pay attention to such minor details in these things, it could be said that it was the Queen giving a subtle jab to Kennedy and America — nothing uncalled for, but certainly, an air of one-up-manship that, frankly, given the distorted image that surrounds King George III on the US side of the Atlantic, was long overdue. Kennedy then views a portrait of “one of the Pitts”, who also happened to be the namesake of the city of Pittsburgh in my native Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which meant that for me, personally, along with the Claire Foy’s Queen Elizabeth and Jodie Balfour’s Jackie Kennedy, I, too, got to have a moment of personal pride when I watched that scene. I could not write this piece without writing about Hamilton. Now, let me state very plainly that all of my friends love Hamilton. I come from a background of musical theatre, and still, even so, it doesn’t take someone who can sing Aida from memory to have heard of this modern retelling of the story of the American Revolution — everyone it seems has fallen in love with this musical. Let me also say that one of my favourite songs is The Story of Tonight, which is featured in the musical, but I first came to know as a song by the band, We The Kings, who, given the nature of this article, have the most ironic band name ever devised; and also, if I may add, the song that the character of King George III sings in the show is so catchy that I have been humming it to myself for about three full days as of this writing. Hamilton is the musical that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, one of America’s founding fathers, the face of the US $10 bill, and the story of how the musical came to be is just as impressive as the selling price for just one ticket to the show, as the hottest musical currently on Broadway (at $400+ per seat!). It began as a production based out of Chicago, IL, and features in a groundbreaking way, people of colour playing the roles of America’s historically lily-white founding fathers, many of whom owned slaves: Washington had three hundred, Jefferson had six hundred; in fact, some of the performers who played these roles are likely playing the characters of real people who may have owned owned some of their ancestors — a fact that made my eyes well up with tears when I first realised it: Hamilton is, in that regard, a beautiful, touching, and truly vindicating production that marks a landmark in US entertainment, and shows how far America has come. For that reason, I love Hamilton. …However, as a Monarchist, I also loathe Hamilton, and it’s because of how it portrays King George III. As it’s an American production, as you may have come to expect by now, none of the unflattering bits of US history are included. It is a complete reimagining of King George III on par with the greedy, tyrannical bully that previously had been shown in animated form during the Schoolhouse Rock! video. But this time, things went a little too far — and it doesn’t take too keen an eye to catch how: The only question I have is… why? In the song entitled You’ll Be Back, King George sings as though he were an estranged and abusive boyfriend, using lines like “don’t throw away this thing we had”, “but I love you,” “now you’re making me mad,” “just remember I’m still your man,” and reminded Americans that he would “kill their friends and family, just to remind them of his love.” The song, sung by Jonathan Groff in the musical, was even given a few notes sung by Prince Harry, who took the Duchess of Sussex out on a date night to see the musical. Though perhaps only a few notes of it were song (just the two opening words of the song, “You say,” the Prince sung, to much applause from the cast and crew who had gathered around to see a real life Royal sing the song sung by their King George III; one of his descendants, in fact. There is a video circulating online that shows that there’s at least one group that got the same interpretation of the song that I did. The musical group Working With Lemons did their own version of the song, with a King George behaving like a tantrum throwing toddler, with a posse of attractive young men around him executing an (admittedly flawless) coreographed dance number; though, there’s that implied homosexuality again. As the song progresses, the dancers began to have makeupp’ed bruises on their faces, implying that the King has struck them. He is also seen using them as a human staircase, and their faces struggle in pain to support his weight. He’s then depicted throwing away food, and while he reclines on his throne, he orders them all to sing his song along with them, as though implying they wouldn’t otherwise, as one of the dancers is seen with a medical sling wrapped around his arm, and his head bandaged. If that shocks you, I wouldn’t be surprised. I recently found out as well that Hamilton actually shows a different version of the show in London than the production in the states: King George’s lines are changed (I can’t imagine why) and he’s given more of them. Why? Well, for my readers in Britain and across the Commonwealth, that should be obvious, King George III was, despite suffering from illness and, yes, having personal flaws of his own, was not the tyrant that Americans portrayed him to be and have since the generations that followed the American Revolution. And for my American readers who might be curious as to who King George III actually was, if not the tyrant that you were brought up to believe him to be, allow me to tell you about The Farmer King who inspired music, loved his wife to the fullest, and contributed strongly to the perpetuation of public arts in London. King George III was born George William Frederick of the House of Hanover in London, on the 25th of October, 1760. At the time, he was one of the most educated and intelligent heirs to the throne to have ever lived, and was dubbed by peers and scholars of the era at the time for being exceptionally bright. He was King of Hanover, though he had never been to Hanover, was elector to the Holy Roman Empire, and was the eldest grandson of King George II, whom he succeeded in Crown after the George II’s passing. Perhaps George III’s largest contribution to British Society — and one that this author speculates that America missed out on, sadly — was to the arts, of which he was a significant patron. In his excellent series on Music and the Monarchy, David Starkey details the patronage of the King to music, and thanks to the King, some of the greatest composers had their largest audiences in London, which was then as it remains today, the musical capital of the world. As The West Wing alluded to, King George’s passion for music was fueled almost solely by the great love that he had for his wife, Queen Charlotte. He loved her with the whole of his heart, and their’s was a love story that would make Shakespeare blush and swoon with envy that he didn’t write it; Buckingham Palace, for instance, is Buckingham Palace because it was purchased by the King for his beloved Queen first as Buckingham House in 1761. The modern equivalent for most people — especially for Americans — I imagine would be a happy, wealthy couple who were contributors of the local arts, and friendly and generous to those less fortunate than themselves, who bought his wife a brand new car, just to let that be the material demonstration of his exuberant, immaterial love for her. They were the couple that you wanted to be, and they had the love that we all wish we could have, and if we found ourselves lucky enough to have it, we would celebrate it every day and hold on to it with the entirety of our heart and soul; what George and Charlotte had was the truest deovtion to one another. Queen Charlotte in her own right was an accomplished musician, and played the harpsichord. She was fond of spreading musical education to new musicians, and funding their expressions and performances during a time when being a musician was, as my fellow New Worlders might say, “nice work, if you could get it” — they don’t call them starving artists for nothing and so very few poorer but musically talented individuals could afford to get started. For them, Queen Charlotte and King George put their dreams into reach, and gave them funds from their personal treasury to begin their careers; as for established musicians and composers, both Fischer and Handel owe at least some of their fame today not only to their talents, but to George and Charlotte, whose favour earned them packed performance halls and music houses across Britain. Upon the River Thames in London, George Handel, upon a boat, debuted his brilliant work, Water Music which was composed for Queen Charlotte at the behest of the King. It marked a significant change in Handel’s composition style, as, for the first time, he would be playing for the public at large in open air upon a moving stage, and so the musical instruments changed to include more wind instruments with louder, resonant sounds, chosen so that the music could be heard by those on either shore of the wide river. Were it not for King George, Handel’s career would have gone quite differently than it did, and his influence upon other musicians would have been different, as well. Later composers, like Hubert Parry and Gustav Holst (this author’s personal favourite composer), would have had wildly different sounds. In fact, the direct influence of Water Music and Handel’s pieces thereafter would have changed Holst’s career so much that his composition, Jupiter, named for the joyful and magnanimous King of the Roman Gods, may never have been composed, as it draws its influence directly from Handel, post-Water Music; and if you wonder of the significance of that, you may recognise Jupiter by it’s other name: I Vow To Thee, My Country. One wonders how American music would be different today had the colonies not rejected King George with such shortsighted haste. The Romans had a saying, “Musica est scientia de scientia Dei”: “The knowledge of music is the knowledge of God.” The spread of such wonderful compositions would have eventually traversed the Atlantic Ocean, and would have refined the Colonies and brought a new dimension to George III was also a patron of the sciences as much as he was the arts. The owner of a telescope, he had an interest in the stars and planets, and often viewed them, charting their transits and movements. He assimilated as much information as he could about the celestial bodies above him, and studied the works of Galileo, the Italian Astronomer, as well as Dr. John Dee, the Court Astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I, both of whom kept incredibly precise records of constellations. One of the King’s favourite art pieces was The Copernican System, the exquisite representation of the Solar System based on the observations of Copernicus, by artist Andreas Cellarius, and it is said that the King sought to have the piece displayed in the Royal residence at Buckingham. The discovery of a planet orbiting the sun after Saturn in 1781 came by means of the efforts of scientist William Herschel; Herschel, whose discovery came at the funding and patronage of King George himself, sought at first to name the planet after his Royal benefactor, as the planet Georgium before settling instead on naming it after Ouranous, the Antetitannical Greek God of the Sky. Up until the time of King George III, it was not common for a monarch to associate with the hired hands of his or her estates — not that they had a disdain for them, on the contrary, they depended upon their work and many great English Kings and Queens demonstrated to them their appreciation in their own unique ways. But it was George III who earned himself the nickname among the English populace as Farmer George; and it is historical happenstance that the name, George, itself comes from the Grecian word geōrgos (γεωργός), meaning “earthworker”, or “he who works the soil”. George went out into the fields and Royal lands and literally worked the soil alongside those in his employ tasked to do so. He learned from them, and developed a fascination with planting, and wrote in his personal papers in beautiful language about the joy of watching the gift of life start from seed and soil grow from sprout to fruit. The nickname of Farmer George was so prevalent that it is from the King and his affection for the land and those who tended to it — not to mention the etymology of his own name — from where we derive the word georgic, meaning, ‘agrarian’, ‘rural’, and ‘country’. Some in King George’s Court mocked the King for taking such great interest in what they called mundane matters such as farming instead of the intrigue and political gamesmanship that normally came natural to the Sovereign. According to the Georgian Papers Programme, in their entry entitled, Farmer George and Notes on Agriculture, they elaborate further: “The anecdotes and caricatures from the 1780s and 1790s tended to depict a friendly, homespun country gentleman rather than a progressive, experimenting improver. The ‘farmer’ characterisation captured both his reportedly simple domestic life and his traditional paternalistic role as the nation’s father as much as his zeal for the theory and practice of agriculture.” During the waning years of his life, George suffered from illness. Steadfast and never failing, his wife, Queen Charlotte, is even depicted in artwork as being more aged than in earlier portraits, and is said to have rarely left her husband’s side, serving as his constant companion and caregiver. The King suffered from porphyria, which causes, among other things, changes in one’s mental processes — “madness”, as they called it at the time, though, today, we know them as a variety of terrible symptoms, including anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, disorientation or paranoia, according to the Mayo Clinic. The King likely suffered seizures as well, at a time when seizures were not truly nor totally understood, and were suspected as being a variety of things, and as doctors experimented with trial and error to both study the phenomenon and alleviate the disease, “treatments” included some horrifying procedures, including drilling holes in the skull to alleviate suspected pressure and swelling. His son, the future King George IV, took over his father’s duties as Prince Regent as his father’s health waned. After suffering a long battle for his health, King George III passed into God’s good mercy on 29 January, 1820. The Declaration of Independence as well as most of the founding documents formally sent by the Continental Congress to King George III, to some extent, go out of their way to insist that their issue was less to do with His Late Majesty and more to do with Parliament — If only more Americans read them! Another lamentable and noteworthy point is that if the King George that I discovered through the research and development of this article was the one that we were taught of in school, we would probably not have the caricature that we do today; and perhaps, in multiple ways, history may have unfolded differently. For my fellow Americans who are reading this humble author’s contribution, I have my own declaration: We have not, as a country or as a society, given this King the credit he is due, and in a truly unfair fashion, most of us have been negligent in our duty to remember and repeat historical truth by not doing more to correct the false, two-dimensional, and cartoonish caricature that has become associated with King George III on our side of the Atlantic. We have tacitly allowed the Hamilton and Schoolhouse Rock! depictions to become common perception, and that common perception, having been left uncorrected and unchecked, has become, in the minds of most Americans, thought of as historical truth, rather than an askewed view of — yes, I’ll say it here — a decent man and a good King. As a Monarchist, the words “last King” ring a melancholy bell in my mind; like the solemn tone of a lone church bell being rung in memoriam: it makes my lip stiffen, it makes me stand up straighter, and suddenly, the vibrant and colourful world that I’ve written of throughout this piece — the world of George and Charlotte — begins to twilight into a sepia-like grayscale world. That sadness deepens when I realise that that gray world is the very world I write this from: The United States of America. This is my first piece written exclusively for Crown and Country. I am humbled and I am honoured to be part of this incredible ongoing project. Throughout my research on King George III, I developed a true affection and admiration for King George III that I didn’t have before. As the King wrote of the joy he felt as he planted seeds that grew into flower and fruit, this assignment planted its own seed, for me, and as this piece progressed, King George III of the House of Hanover became one of my newest favourite monarchs. As a writer, my duty is to truth, in all its forms. American culture and even its own established annals of history have not reflected the truth of King George. It is up to Monarchists and Republicans alike to repaint the portrait of America’s most misunderstood King. We must remember and reflect our own history accurately. It is said that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it; but how can we learn from history if we don’t remember it properly? Or if our perception of it is wrong? What sort of lessons do we actually derive from a faulty understanding of history? And finally, if our perception of history is flawed, aren’t we therefore learning all the wrong lessons, today? We could learn a thing or two from King George III. But before we can do that, we must, in effect, clear the reputation of the Farmer King.

Image by 7706992 from Pixabay Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedies. -- Groucho Marx I'm kidding you not -- I am way too much of a political cynic as to ever play anything resembling an activist of any sort. So, it's a sheer coincidence if any of my writings look like a naiive attempt to ""make a difference in this world"". Indeed, at this age of 77 I would have no stamina, and even less of a stomach to lock horns with anyone, especially since their horns would more than likely be much longer. And now, aside of all this apparent chickenshit, let me ask you something -- hey folks, why are we allowing our leaders to lead us from one international hostility to another, from one economic crisis to another, from one national division to another? Come on, hasn't everybody got tired by even reading history books -- let alone agreeing to keep repeating any of that shameful crap! So I say -- hypothetically, of course -- how about we all stop voting for this kind of leaders whose careerism and greed for power has made this planet an arena of political gladiators, with massive spectators either cheering or bitching or both in a trance of deception. Like a bunch of kids playing Superman, political hot heads in power seemingly get carried away inventing one enemy after another, and becoming one as well in the process. Which wouldn't even be but a juicy spectacle for us-the-people, if they ever rolled up their sleeves to personally kick each other's ass in a ring. Hey, join me in having fun at imagining how it all might go. Like, I am not sure what color of martial arts belts those Chinese and Japanese leaders may have, but -- sorry to say it, considering his terrible reputation -- but Putin might kick quite a few asses. As for Sleepy Joe, I picture him going all confused around the ring and trying to make a deal, like: ""If you don't kick me in the stomach, I won't kick your nuts...if you don't punch my face, I won't bite your ear, if you don't break my nose, I won't spit on you..."" -- and so on, until they would just mercifully disqualify him. This reminds me of a scene in the movie ""Troy"", where Achilles (played by Brad Pitt) is summoned as a champion of one state to fight the champion of another, which was to prevent the battle between the two armies. That's where the unbeatable Achilles mumbles as if for himself -- before rushing to kill twice his size opponent: ""Hmmm...when will these kings fight by themselves their fights, instead of this"". Maybe those were not exactly his words, but what kind of memory do you expect from a 77 years old fart. So, where was I, before this movie story...? Yeah, just look at the inflation, at price of gas and food, and prices of everything else raising like crazy. I can even imagine some of those single dudes already worrying if the whores are also going to raise the price for their noble services. News are full of nonsense as usual, with everybody hating everybody else, and even good Mother Nature is not treating us as its welcome tenants, with all disasters around the globe going on. As an amateur quantum enthusiast, I'm suspecting that we are being punished for letting a handful of super rich and their political puppets systematically ruin the beautiful face of our Mother Earth. Serves us right. Image by Benny B2R from Pixabay Vote: the instrument and symbol of a freeman's power to make a fool of himself and a wreck of his country. -- Ambrose Bierce Up there I was a sort of suggesting that we all stop voting. I already did, at the last federal election I showed them my teeth of a pissed anti-voter, after first practicing well as an anti-vaxxer. And now, during the current provincial elections I decided not to pick the smallest among several evils. (For all those who don't know it yet -- I live in Canada, as if that's supposed to make any damn difference to them where I live). All kidding aside -- I know it doesn't matter at all whether I vote or not, because there are millions of those out there who can't hardly wait to get that deceiving taste of being included in governmental affairs -- while the winner in that race in laughing all the way to their throne, acting like a king from that point on. As always, those who invested the most money into their political ads have the best chance to win, as always -- regardless of their qualifications; they are literally ""the best advertised item on the political market"" -- that's all. Really, why else do they need that few months long pre-election period, but for self-promotion. At the bottom line it's only a job, and it should be enough to publicly present each of the candidates ""portfolio"" -- and then vote based on those qualifications. Why go from city to city, shake hands, hold some babies, an sweet talk everyone with a bunch of lies. Well, in short, if there was such an election where we could vote ""against all candidates"", I would be among those carrying the banners. Maybe even shouting something, just for the hell of it, like to vent my frustrations over the upcoming expensive repairs on my little Toyota. All others are doing the same anyway, like clueless about what is really pissing them so much -- and with politicians being a perfect channel for that accumulated crappy energy to be discharged. In my old dreamy head sometimes I am picturing a different kind of leaders. Someone elected by the Supreme court, not by the people who judge a candidate by their looks, and by their style of lying in speeches prepared for them by experts in manipulation with masses. You know, that well tested bunch of cliches and phrases that always work. Like a trigger-word in hypnotic induction, certain phrases ensure that well conditioned people become instant believers. Indeed, wouldn't you rather have for a leader one of those meek, somewhat neurotic and unassuming, but very smart academic with thick glasses which don't let them see as far as China and Russia, to ""notice"" what they are secretly plotting against us. For, by the way, neuroscientists are telling us how we don't ""see"" with our eyes but with our brains, so we see what we believe. Really, someone stripped of all those flashy epithets and powers, in short -- someone who knows what the hell they are supposed to do if they are to qualify to call themselves a leader of a whole nation. Running a country takes some brains, not merely a strong ambition and hunger for power. I am just wondering how many more generations of us sheepheads it will take before we, the smartest species on earth, happen to hatch from our shells and suddenly realize that we've been played by a handful of political illusionists, who are ""representing our best interests -- not the interests of the richest"". Yeah, right. In that sense, there is some promise already in this young generation who are seemingly all into cell phones, tattoos, rap music, and football -- all-in-all not giving a damn about something like politics. Then I go a little creative in my daydreaming, also envisioning E.T.'s as landing down by thousands, neutralizing our heavy weaponry, and telepathically changing our brains into something healthier. Of course, not before they would first apologize to us for not doing it right those millennia back in time when they messed up by underestimating the genetic power of that crazy monkey whose genes they combined with their own to create us. Don't you ever have such dreams after watching our daily news? Image by jeffjacobs from Pixabay Everything is changing. People are taking comedians seriously and their politicians as a joke. -- Will Rogers By the way, no matter how much you may be enjoying reading this literary masterpiece, I am not planning to make it much longer. But, before I go, I owe an apology to the religious folks, for not elaborating a little on that, maybe the best of all solutions -- of Jesus returning to kick the ass of that dude living in the architectural luxury of Vatican, surrounded by his disciples -- I think they are called ""cardinals"". Hmmm... here in Canada that's what we call some cute little birds with red heads and wings. Sorry, birdies for calling you names. Now, not being a religious dude, I love Jesus, Buddha, and I wish I knew more of such wonderful individuals to love. As for Jesus, he was preaching about everything that we are not. Meaning some loving creatures living in harmony with each other in our big human family. Instead, we are attending our churches, synagogues, mosques and temples, and then bombing the hell out of each other under some most insane excuses, which only start making some pervert sense if we follow the money. Yes, we need Jesus -- albeit the question remains whether he would need us, because our politicians are just of a kind that they might crucify him again. They don't want any competition when power is in question. And their bosses -- those mighty corporations, certainly don't need anyone to spoil their grand game on this planet. In the meantime, while we are waiting for some merciful benevolent force to remove these parasitic specimens like politicians from power, what do you say -- is there any legal way to get rid of them ""mis-leading"" us? O.K., I understand, we would first have to snap out of their hypnotic spell, enough to see how they keep using the well tested formula invented by Mafia. That is, invent an enemy and impose yourself as a savior -- for a fee, which means the highest seat in the government. So that everybody is suddenly an ""enemy"" -- Chinese, Russians, Vietnamese, North Koreans, Afghans, Iranians, Iraqi, Mexicans, Blacks, Republicans/Democrats, journalists...why not also extraterrestrials. Image by IudaM from Pixabay Sometimes I wonder if the world is being run by smart people who are putting us on, or by imbeciles who really mean it. -- Mark Twain Well, it must be nice to live in one of those small countries, whose only enemy is their own government. The only problem for them arises when they get economically coerced into joining NATO -- now being forced to listen carefully to the American directives whom to start hating and badmouthing -- all according to the America's ""national interests"". So that, should they be told -- they would go to kill some poor bastards who never did anything bad to them. (Remember Bush's war, when he announced to the world: ""You are either with us, or against us in this war."") And everybody was with him, not necessarily enthusiastic, but joining -- with the British Prime Minister, by the name of Tony Blair, later on publicly admitting that he got sucked into that illegal war by America. Hey, Americans are wonderful folks, and none of this has absolutely anything to do with what their leaders are doing, except for one single thing -- they have an awfully bad taste when they elect those leaders. Well, so much I had for this installment of my badmouthing this second-oldest profession, the next after prostitution. With both being heavily involved in screwing business, this one is taking taxes for their services -- not the money left on the night table. O,K,, I hope you have been at least somewhat entertained with this bunch of political truisms. So, I don't expect that anyone should get an ""intellectual indigestion"", as all ingredients for this article have already been much used, while only the recipe is my own. © 2022 Val Karas"
4,Did Your US School Teach The Opposing Arguments to the American Revolution?,politics," Caston George is a 10-year veteran political professional and former politician, accomplished writer, researcher, author, and archivist. The Doctrine of Default Republicanism is host to a myriad of flaws and sketchy justifications for its necessity and existence - yet is rarely questioned in American minds or evaluated for and on its own merits - and this is the reason why. Reading a lot of Royalist writings from the 1600's and 1700's has evinced in me some glaring critiques of the Republican form of government, which, I am now of the mind, is neither the best that can be done, or could be had, nor is it anywhere near. In America, I recall a teacher once rolliong his eyes and asking aloud how crazy people were to believe in the Divine Right of Kings for instance - a topic of which, clearly, he knew only insofar as his opinion on it extended, and I do not believe for a moment he read anything by any pro-Divine Right writer of the time.There are secular benefits to such beliefs being Instituted; and the practical effects numerous, if not obvious to all.I remember him teaching us about the federalist papers, and that there weren't any lessons or encouragements or exhortations to cross examine or to analyse from the perspectives of the time the arguments against Republics with any real credibility.This was also in a special class I took on history, a sort of re-examination of what we had already come to know in elementary and primary school: for instance, the American Revolution.It occurs to me that people do not question republics, nor America's necessity in the world; nor do they question whether or not the founding of America was a good thing.They do not question what might be different if America had never been founded. Many might even shudder to think, but, never consider that perhaps such an alternative timeline would have netted a better world or way of life for them, or maybe even more freedom than they have today, or a better government, if the American revolutionaries had just encouraged their people to pay their taxes like normal folk and stfu. We can go into what might be different in the next article, I have a few ideas.For now, let us wonder as to that unquestionability and why questioning America earns one mockery and social and academical leprosy.I believe part of the matter, or the root thereof, is that American students are taught the history of America quite very young, and quite very one sidedly.Granted, to some degree, that is to be expected, but one hopes for a comprehensive and well-versed understanding of the reasons behind the founding on all sides.Or, at the very least, an understanding that wars are fought for reasons that are more than one sided - that there aren't heroes and villains by default in most wars, and that the arguments on both sides were good enough that people on opposing sides of a debate took up arms for their point and cause. The British Empire was not tyrannizing America. King George III was not actually a tyrant. But to believe the hype in American history books, he was bloody awful; so why is he beloved today in England? He had his faults, but is in no wise viewed as a wicked or evil king.In America, they see him as a caricature, a complete distortion, but have no interest in correcting their view, and even when presented with fact and factuality, they are in my experience likely to doubt it, or tune it out; as though facts and truth were neither.Even when that is confirmed and evident to them, they don't believe it, nor do they wish to revisit or revise what they came to learn already, even if it was a complete bullocking of the truth.  I believe that this is due to when the American Revolution is taught in schools, which I assert is perhaps even more important factor to this understanding of the unquestionably of republicanism and America, than even the content of what is taught, what is left out, or how one sided it is. American students first learn about the Pilgrims and who George Washington is, in kindergarten. First, second, and third grades, with increasing detail, still one sidedly, revisit the American Revolution again and again each year up until about middle school.After that, the American Revolution is sidelined as having been covered extensively already, in favour of other history. What this does in effect is indoctrinate a one sided war theory and governmental model as being the only desirable model that there is, in their limited exposure.Perhaps by design, this is done when they are children, during the years that they are forming the foundational pillars upon which they will rest and stand and stabilise their view of the world for the rest of their lives.People tend not to question such pillars as are those that are learned early on, and tend not to revisit them throughout their lives; if they did, not everyone would take it well if the world they discovered they lived in this whole time was not what they always understood it to be.It could be a profound and wonderful experience for some.For others, it could terrifying. And so, the effect is the instillation and inoculation of the Republican and American doctrine and dogma, for an average person's life.So a way to reapproach this, without addressing content, what is taught, or what is blatantly left out of what is taught (like the entire other argument, why, or an examination of critique of the pro-American argument with any real scrutiny)... ...would be to teach the American Revolution for the first time, to any real depth, in high school, rather than before they lose their baby teeth; when children are past that formative period, and are into a period where they are questioning things (even if not their aforesaid pillars right away), rather than when they are children unquestioning of adult figures, like parents and teachers, whom they deem as each an authority.That act alone would in fact accompolish the goal of addressing the lack of whole information or cross examination, because the students, at that stage of their academic lives, would do it for us. Thanks to the internet, they would question what they're taught about the American Revolution, and get their answers.You might have a few more thousand Monarchists in your town than you do right now if they did.And the Republicans that you would have (not GOP, mind you, term used traditionally) would be wiser and better republic advocates for having questioned, looked, learned, and came to their own mind, rather than a series of manufactured patrioism-tropes that they mouth the words and motions of but do not truly grasp or understand.Every real effort to learn about Republicanism ought to have as deep and well-read understanding and comprehension of Monarchy, and vice-versa, by virtue of what I would describe as any good research technique worth it's salt and sulphur.One cannot just expose oneself to one side of one debate, because propaganda and jingoism become incorrectly understood as facts rather than one side of a two sided coin.It would be like allowing a presidential debate but with only one candidate, and letting that candidate and his critique of his opposition (not allowed in the debate or left out entirely) and his view of their platform to become understood as what their platform is, truly, and that it couldn't be anything else. A friend of mine who loves America is sitting with me as I write this... And I explained to him, and I believe he understood and thoughtfully considered what I had to say about this concept, about what I call the long lists of misters, and how republicanism, rather than advancing his freedom, protecting his opportunities, can oppress them by default of the system. Equality is not the same as equity; I hold Equity to be the superior of the two. Equality and Equity are not equal. And thank God for that.Equality has downsides, I explained; a concept which would earn one strange looks in any American debate on anything. Equality being put on a pedestal by all sides of all ideologies, but, their understanding of it being limited to only American and Republican dogma and doctrine, don't consider the logical endpoints of their equality-based republic.The homeless might be able to explain it to you, if this article is insufficient to illustrate and demonstrate one of equality's downsides.It takes an unequal one to liberate the equal many - one who is not like the others around him - to make any change in a republic happen of any real meaning or import; that is to say, it takes, sometimes, the principle of inequality to save the principle of equality.Rudolph was the one reindeer unlike the others, and look what he accomplished; though he had to put up with a whole lot of reindeer games before he led them.The homeless are en masse, herein, referred to as such, and that reference is symptomatic of painting people with big and broad brushes, and I recognise that as I write this.But, it's suits both their and my purposes right now, even if that is not yet readily apparent, for these reasons; each of them are equal.I call them long lists of ""misters"".Even if the homeless got together with people power, after all, as an often ignored and underappreciated, forgotten about, and other-ised, dehumanised, and stigmatised bloc or segment of people and society, to unionise or organise, they would still find little success; and little success has been the result of all efforts previously to do so, in most instances.You would think that not be the case, after all, they are, on paper at least, even if CERTAINLY not in practice, equal to those who ignore them in society.But equality becomes a millstone around the neck because of the unwritten and customary inequalities that people tacitly accept as ""the way things are"" without thinking too hard about their absurdity or obscenity insofar as toleration of their presence as factors in modern society.And so, a group of homeless organisers petition themselves, and make a case for their lack of providence, for their dignity, and for their humanisation - to be treated as neighbours instead of ""dont feed the wildlife"", as is often the literal case.""Aren't you guys smart,"" says a patronizing person to whom they present this petition, which they all, each of them, upon the principle of people, signed.A bunch of misters.A mister bunch not dissimilar to the mister individual they presented it to. Remember, they are ""equal"", aren't they?Yes, they are: they are all en masse, equally ignored.That list is set aside in a drawer, that petition will never be read.Because the majority that aren't homeless still scapegoat them, and the individual mister they presented their long list of misters to, still, aren't more misters than are the misters in the housed majority, whose opinion, in a system predicated upon results of petty popularity contests, is ignorant, unbudging, and therefore, as their representative by larger majoritarian number than the homeless petitioners, the individual mister they present their petition to, patronizes them, but in the end, will ignore them for politics sake.Because their stigma would taint his electoral chances in the next petty popularity contest.Because no matter how much people power they have, they are not popular.And popularity, not a constitution, therefore, determines their quality and way of life.They will never upset that balance or apple cart of their own power or capacities or agencies, not even en masse, short of revolution or societal economic collapse as an evener of their economic fortunes to that of the housed majority.Enter in: He who is unlike all of the others. Likely misunderstood, and even amongst the homeless (whether he is homeless hinmself or not) probably not popular. Perhaps as popular as a Monarchist in America! But, if the homeless can collectively get over their own scapegoating and shaming of he who is not like the rest of the group (a common American tradition going back to witch trials is to shun the guy not doing what everyone else is doing, and being horrible to that guy) they will find in him, if agreeable, their hero who can save them.Because they cannot and will not likely ever, of their own powers, save themselves - not because they are incapable, and not because they can't or won't, but because they are outnumbered in system that divvies power, horrifyingly enough, based on mathematical tally of participation - that of quantity of those who support an argument, rather than the quality of the argument itself - that will be what most accord to at the end of the petty popularity process. AND THE LAW OF CONTRARY EFFECT"
5,Abortion and Politics: Then and Now,politics," Ignore the in-my-face obvious issues and lend all of my attention to unwarranted, groundless non-issues?

Not happening! Pixabay Did you know? A baby's heartbeat can be detected at just 5 1/2 to 6 weeks in utero Here in America, we dropped the ball, long ago! In terms of how this Country was designed and structured to work and the course that it has actually been on, especially over the past 50 years or so; it is far removed from a Government - of, by and for the people In 1973, Roe v. Wade was passed by an extremely progressive Supreme Court! As if to say, you the people hold no power here, we, the court, hold all power, even over life! We weren't to talk about it, discuss it, challenge it, we were to accept it and shut up about it, like good little serfs are supposed to do Between the radically activist Supreme Court of the time and the loud and proud feminists, with their books and materials, filled with man hate and tales of inconsequential life....it was the perfect storm! It was sold under the pretense of being all about us girls, but was it really? In the midst of the perfect storm, Planned Parenthood began setting up shop in cities all across the Nation, making it so much simpler to shirk any and all responsibility, dead in its tracks... All of this was planned out by Progressives. It was mapped out in the progressive mind long before they had their day in Court. With the Court in place which they needed, their vision became a reality! But at what cost? Unfortunately, nothing beyond their agenda, was ever considered. I often wonder if people know anything about the founder of Planned Parenthood, the Eugenicist, Margaret Sanger; what she believed, what she was all about? I seriously doubt it! Because, again: We weren't to talk about it We weren't to discuss it We weren't to challenge any fragment, piece or segment of it Unless, of course, it was to sing its praises and promote it. Did you know? During weeks 10 and 11 of pregnancy, baby will start to inhale tiny bits of amniotic fluid. It's an inhalation, but more of a swallowing movement for them. It helps their lungs, already developing. By 36 weeks, a baby's lungs are fully developed. Baby has been ""practice breathing"" for four weeks or longer. They inhale amniotic fluid and take in their mothers oxygen, so they instinctively know what to do, when they make their grand entrance into the world. Jane Roe was an alias, her real name was Norma McCorvey. In time, she came around and no longer supported or agreed with, the act of abortion. She has since passed away, but before she did, she wrote several books. One of them, ""Won By Love"", shares some heavy stuff. What I've shared, I see as the beginning of her awakening. An excerpt from the book: ""I remember one rally in particular where a young woman approached me. She was very cute with long, straight hair, great big green eyes and fair skin. So you're Jane Roe, she said. That's right. Can I touch you? Where? I said immediately, always on my guard! I just think it's like, cool - what you've done; how you've made it possible for me to get my abortions. Abortions, I said, stressing the plural, how many have you had? I don't know, the girl shrugged. Five or six I guess. I cringed. The girl noticed it, but my act was involuntary. I wasn't trying to be cruel, but even back then, I knew getting an abortion wasn't like getting a haircut. How come you had that many, I asked. Didn't you learn anything after the first time? I could understand a woman making one mistake. I could even understand a woman making the same mistake twice. But half a dozen times? I'm sorry. I didn't have any patience for that. I had to get away from her. I couldn't stand there and talk to her anymore. I left the rally early, the girl's words, ""I don't know, five or six I guess"", ringing in my ears, haunting me and went directly to a bar, where I downed a couple shots of straight tequila. I waited for the alcohol to take effect before I went back to my room to chase it down with five or six beers.""  Large numbers of abortions wasn't unusual for girls in middle school in the 70's, after Roe v. Wade passed. I would cringe often at the stories I would hear, at the games that would be played with people's lives, with seemingly no remorse at the time. Until the stories would come back to haunt them, until the games they played...became nightmares! So many lives of young women who were close to me, changed, as a result of this decision...and never once, for the better! I am sorry to have to say that I have had to talk more than one of them out of committing suicide. As far as I am concerned, nothing good ever comes from abortion. I am pleased that the current Supreme Court has revisited this decision and is discussing it. It should be a matter for the States. It should have always been, but it was politicized. It is politicized still! No? How did we find out that the current Supreme Court has revisited this nearly half a century old decision and have drawn their own conclusions? A leak, most likely by a law clerk - someone who has obviously chosen the wrong profession! Suddenly, a network of abortion activists ready with their insta-signs, insta-chants and insta-overreaction! Instead of welcoming what this actually means, a returning of power to the people...they work against us! Fifty years later and there are still those who choose to play these destructive games...with people's lives. My prayer is for common sense and a sense of humanity to make its return to this country. Look how far we've strayed! Nowadays, the conversations by abortion supporters aren't reluctant or remorseful. It is no longer about a one time way out or as a last resort, with no other options... Now it has become all about justifying the taking of a human life, even when it comes in the form of a full term healthy baby, they call it ""women's health"" and expect us all to dumb down and go along with it. Now it has become...what to do about the little inconveniences, when they survive an abortion attempt...how to make them go away! Every line that supposedly would never be crossed, has been crossed and then stomped on and spat upon. Where does it end? Sources Won By Love Healthline © 2022 A B Williams"
6,How Is Hardly Mentioned Natural Immunity Alone Protecting the 40% of Mankind Against Covid-19?,politics," Val is not a medical scientist, but a free thinker capable of telling apart true science from a politically tailored one. Image by geralt from Pixabay Alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceutical drugs are legal, but they can hurt a lot of people. -- Ziggy Marley I always loved playing with logic, just like any other out-of-box thinker, not necessarily buying the obvious and the mainstream -- but looking for a possible alternate truth. That's how I stumbled upon so much lack of logical explanation by the politico-medical authorities, when it comes to this covid-19 pandemic. In this particular instance I am simply wondering about something that any free thinking person would find peculiar and not really making any sense. It's all expressed in the title of this post, with some additional unanswered questions to be asked. O.K., so they told us that the virus was ""deadly and airborne"". As for the ""airborne"" part, what exactly does it mean -- when matched to the horrendously draconian restrictions that were enforced? Let's get clear about it. It cannot mean that it is only ""airborne"" if someone would sneeze and cough around you, and you would pick up those droplets. For, what are realistic chances that so many people would sneeze and cough in a chorus at so many places that so many people would get infected? Indeed, ""airborne"" must mean that anything you touch, or the air that your are inhaling at ANY place -- is a good chance for you to get infected by that virus. Now, if it's not so, then why such a draconian preventive measures to be enforced at all? And if it is so, then how is it medically possible that the most of the mankind is not in the Intensive Care Unit or dead, because it would be practically impossible during two years to avoid the bug. You see why there is no logic in it? Two years of exposure is a very long time for virtually anyone not to touch something with the virus on it, or not to breathe with an infected person around them? Also, please, try to agree that by the time you came home from a crowded shopping mall where you touched so many things -- it is too late for you to wash your hands, because the bug is already all over you -- if it's so ""airborne and submicroscopic"" that it could literally enter through your eyes and ears that are not protected by a mask Now, someone will rush to say that not all of the world's populace are susceptible to this virus, because their natural immunity is strong enough to fight it. Image by Rollstein from Pixabay Why there is no cure for cancer. Because the medical industry doesn't want one. And the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want one. Because they would lose a lot of money! -- Genesis P. Orridge Did I really dare...have audacity, to mention these taboo words! Words that our Presidents, Prime Ministers, Their Exellences, all Grand Poobahs of Medicine, the Media, and all other puppets of the Big Pharma have been avoiding like devil avoids facing a cross! For two years we didn't hear anything else but ""vaccines...get vaccinated...get the booster -- not an official word about the possibility that our natural immunity could protect us. And nothing about Big Pharma working on a cheaper capsules with those existing and proven to work formulas. Yes, existing and proven to work, since they did such a nice job on Donald Trump's quick recovery. The suggestion about Ivermectine was promptly hushed, with no one caring that so many doctors had used it successfully to treat covid-19 infection. Instead, we were begged, scared, persuaded, coerced, blackmailed, even bribed with free game tickets and burgers -- just to get vaccinated. But no word about our natural immunity. The one which has kept almost half of the mankind alive. Why would they advertise natural immunity? -- there is no money in it. So many of us got scared shitless from daily bombardments with reports about numbers of hospitalized and dead -- and with that stress lowering our natural immunity we really needed anything, a vaccine, or a placebo in form of one, whatever actually worked. So, O.K., what is the proof that almost the half of the world's populace had natural immunity strong enough to ward off an infection? The answer is right in front of our noses -- in form of some billions of globally unvaccinated individuals who are still alive after they, logically, HAD TO get in contact with the virus during over the last two years. Which raises the logical question: How many of those vaccinated actually had a good natural immunity, but succumbed to the suggestive advances of politico-medical authorities working for the interests of Big Pharma? Now, why am I repeatedly mentioning ""billions"" of unvaccinated people? According to Google, about 60% of the world's population got fully vaccinated, and with roughly almost nine billion people on this planet, it leaves 40%, or over 3 billion people who never received a vaccine. Thus, I am not  making up that number of unvaccinated people who went through two years of this pandemic with no other protection but their natural immunity. In many quite populated countries vaccines were not introduced at all, here mostly talking about those so called ""third world countries"". But then, why only look at them -- if even most of the Republicans in one advanced United States of America refused to be vaccinated. Besides, it didn't take only those ""uneducated, and misinformed"" to refuse the vaccine -- but look at all those renowned virologists, hospital doctors, nurses, teachers, a massive number of PhD's who found something ""unconvincing"" about the vaccines -- to use the mildest word. Statistics actually showed that those who refused to get vaccinated were mostly educated, or highly educated individuals. I may be totally wrong, but I, personally, never believed the official reports about all those numbers of infected and dead. Not because my out-of-box mind-style would automatically make of me a paranoid conspiracy theorist. But rather because it became ridiculously impossible for the John Hopkins University to gather fresh daily reports from every hospital of every city in the world -- so that we could hear about them in the morning news. I believe that the advertisement machinery for the vaccine was well set up, people well primed with fear to be sure and steady customers, and I also believe that many, many of those labeled as covid-19 victims didn't die of the virus at all. You feel free to believe your own thing, I'll respect it. Image by Richards Drawings from Pixabay Money has transformed every watchdog, every independent authority. Medical doctors are increasingly gulled by the lobbying of pharmaceutical salesmen. -- Thomas Frank Now we are coming to something where my lack of education in these matters can only try to be compensated by sheer logicalness. Why have kids been mostly exempted from this infection? Not that there were no isolated cases, but even as lay people we know enough about possible genetic predisposition in some kids for respiratory, or any other disease for that matter. But the initial story -- while Big Pharma didn't yet impose vaccine for five years old and above -- was that kids were generally safe from covid-19. We must say that the ""Anthony Fauci's science"" has been changing a lot -- albeit we have been strongly urged to ""follow that science"". Back to the kids' suddenly unrecognized natural immunity -- for the longest time, the incidents of kids' infections were quite rare. Why was that -- if this virus is supposed to be so ""deadly and airborne""? Look at any other deadly pathogen -- like cholera, malaria, tuberculosis, tetanus, even our yearly flu, and so many others that I don't know about to mention them here -- and you don't see any age-exemptions there. And if covid-19 is not in the category of the above diseases, why have we had restrictions which were suggesting exactly that? I admit, I have from ever thought that children's biology was much more delicate than the one of grownups. This tiny critter covid proved me wrong. For a dash of humor, maybe it's because kids are not watching TV news to be indoctrinated into belief about a ""deadly virus"" going around, so their immunity stayed intact and free from that stress. And then, of course, we also have all those stories about some people being ""infected but asymptomatic"". So, again, we have to stumble on that unpopular couple of words -- ""natural immunity"". Really, folks, why are the authorities playing with words while avoiding to say that there is a big chance that your natural immunity will protect you? Like, they have been using a lot that phrase ""some people are at higher risk"" -- which automatically implies that there are also those at ""lower risk"". And they might as well be the most of the population, again, looking at all of us who have survived this pandemic without getting a series of that ""magic needle"" stuck into our arm. On the other hand, there are those vaccinated ones who got a stroke, heart inflammation, cerebral palsy, reproductive problems, and what else is there to only be discovered as a long term side effect -- not forgetting to mention the currently increasing number of them ending up in the Intensive Care Unit. So with this virus being so deadly -- judging by the draconian restrictions, which by the way presented nothing short of an act of medical terrorism and political dictatorship -- we have this lovely variety of kids and grownups who are only ""partially"" affected. or not affected at all, despite their two years long exposure. One would never expect that from a pathogen with so persistently morbid advertisement. Well, what can I say but keep wondering if the big politico-medical racket will drag itself into yet another year, or even stay with us indefinitely -- simply because masses of people choose fear over logical thinking. For, it's one thing that ads can try their best using the scaring tactics -- but entirely another thing if we are buying it.

7,What's Wrong We Are Doing to Get Gender Equality,politics," We, as a human being are trying for soo long to gain gender equality but still not successfull. Here I am listed some factors and solutions. Gender equality is a term that is often used to describe an ideal situation in which all individuals have the same opportunities and rights. In theory, gender equality would mean that women and men would have an equal chance of achieving success in their careers and lives. However, in reality, gender equality is far from being a reality for many women and men around the world. There are many reasons why gender equality is not yet a reality for many women and men. Some of the reasons include the fact that women are often paid less than men, they are more likely to be victims of violence, and they are less likely to be promoted in their careers. For a long time, we are trying to get gender equality but still, we haven't achieved it. Here are some factors which are avoiding us to achieve our goal: There are a number of policies that should be put in place for women in the workplace. These policies can help ensure that women have a fair and equal opportunity to succeed in the workplace.  Some of the key policies that should be in place for women in the workplace include:  -A policy that ensures that women are provided with equal opportunities for promotion and advancement. -A policy that provides maternity leave and paternity leave. -A policy that ensures that women are able to work from home if necessary. -A policy that provides women with equal pay for equal work. -A policy that provides women with harassment and discrimination protections. The government trying to empower women by providing some policies that favor woman empowerment, But these policies haven't made the impact that they have to do because the government only start focusing on providing them reserved seats in the election, school, colleagues, and even in government jobs instead of providing them proper protection. Here are some suggestions— Government should increase the number of police for patrolling especially at late night.— Government should promote women to engage in transportation and inspire them to become a driver of cabs, buses as well as local automobiles. This helps women to safely travel at night.— At the local level, all women of an area should come together and form an association that petrol their area turn by turn at night. There are many laws that apply specifically to women, both in the United States and around the world. Here are a few examples: In the United States, women are protected by the Equal Rights Amendment, which states that ""no law shall be made which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States."" This amendment was ratified in 1972 and has since been used to fight for women's rights, including equal pay, access to education and health care, and protection from domestic violence and sexual assault. In many countries, women are legally required to receive a divorce or a legal separation if they are married, in order to protect their rights and property. This is often seen as a way to protect women from being financially abused by their husbands. In many countries, women are protected from discrimination in the workplace, including in salary and promotion. In the United States, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is responsible for enforcing these laws, and organizations like the National There are many laws to protect women but still, the number of violations of laws against women doesn't seem to be down. Protest against these have started, This is because the government provides special laws to women to protect them but some women who belong to the city (generally) or have a criminal mindset use these laws to exploit or hare men while the women in a small village who need such laws are not aware of these laws. That's the main reason why these laws are fair they exploit ordinary men. The main points—Government is focusing on giving better careers to women by reservation. instead, the government should focus on providing better protection—Government should modify laws that give extreme power to women by which some women exploit men."
8,How Badly We Need to Wake Up From Big Pharma's Vaccine Selling Scaring Tactics,politics," Val is not a medical scientist, but a free thinker capable of telling apart true science from a politically tailored one. Image by geralt from Pixabay ( A note: You can skip this video below, if you wish, and get right to the text of the article -- but if you choose to see it first, it may give you a valuable insight into the real power of the Big Pharma, which is quite relevant to everything written here. It is also to offer some credibility to the article, so that it is not perceived as merely ""another conspiracy theory with much misinformation"" hitting on the ""godsend of the vaccines and their makers"".) Science and politics benefit from the perception that science is objective and separate. -- Unknown With allegedly more and more fully vaccinated people ending up in hospitals, we might as well start asking ourselves few questions that we could have asked ourselves more than a year ago. The first one should be obvious. Namely, do vaccines work at all, or is it merely a case of an achieved collective placebo effect with a heavy suggestion by authorities that those recipients of vaccines are ""safe now""? Next -- what if one of the long term side effects of vaccines is that it is actually messing up our natural immunity by being calibrated as ""specific"" to protect us from a couple of variants -- making our immunity blind to recognize any different ones? Next -- since this virus and its apparently inexhaustive number of variants are staying with us, just like the flu bug -- for how long are we supposed to keep taking these ""booster shots""? Indefinitely, looks like being the answer. So what's the real deal with these vaccines and boosters if you can end up in hospital's intensive care unit with a full blast of symptoms after being fully vaccinated? Are we really such programmable sheepheads not to see how we just keep feeding the fat goose Big Pharma without any guarantee for a true protection, and without their liability in case of a harm done with their vaccines. Indeed, folks, why haven't they come up with a cheaper pill to be administered to those seriously infected, while letting all others live a normal life? Because, we know that such pill or a combination of pills exist -- since Donald Trump received one in his speedy recovery. Why all these lies? Ever heard of any leader dying of covid-19? And not that we should be done with this line of questions, but there is this huge one that we simply can't and shouldn't ignore: Why some countries could drop all restrictions, including masks, while ours are still being enforced? Are those to be seen as some ""other species"" than we are? And are their medical scientists some ""ignorants not caring about the welfare of their people""? Indeed, how should we understand this crazy discrepancy in medical science, with one ""theory"" being that people should just live with the virus -- because fear is merely doing a number on their immunity; and the other ""theory"" being that ""people should keep getting boosters, wear masks, and stay away from airports if not fully vaccinated"". Image by johnhain from Pixabay As they say in Scotland, ""Who pays the Piper, calls the tune."" -- Unknown Furthermore, how should we ""follow the science"", if some of the prominent world's virologists were against vaccination, along with a massive number of hospital doctors and nurses refusing to get vaccinated at a cost of losing their jobs? What science are they professing, which is so strong and convincing to them that they -- who are daily exposed to people infected by this virus -- don't want to ""protect"" themselves with a vaccine? I don't know about you, but to me these are some very legit questions, and I don't really see myself as ""spreading some misinformation and conspiracy theorizing"" in this article. And are all those just a bunch of conspiracy theorists who are contending that medical science has been dogmatized, corrupted and politicized for the benefits of the extremely influential giant -- the Big Pharma. The one that seems to be calling all shots these days with what goes and what doesn't go on this planet. The World Health Organization, influenced by the Big Pharma, has been wrong many times before. Medical institutions are heavily financed by the Big Pharma. Medical schools are getting directives from the Big Pharma what goes and doesn't go in their curriculum. The FDA has been approving many drugs which later on had to be taken off the shelves for their damaging, or even lethal effect. And statistics is still there of over 350,000 yearly deaths being caused by medical screwups in the US alone. Yes, doctors are saving a life every second, but those are emergency cases, not longer term therapeutic procedures that would rely on a good science. Who am I to say that? Well, it's not any secret that the medical practice is mainly treating the symptoms, not causes. With an admitted over 90% of all diseases and conditions being caused by stress, why hasn't it become number one concern of medicine to invent treatments -- possibly including something like brain frequency generators -- which would target stress levels in patients? Namely, stress produces beta brain waves, and with a frequency entrainment brain could develop new neural pathways which would operate on lower, alpha brain waves. The science of neuroplasticity is clearly telling us that we can reprogram our brains for a good stress management, by changing our predominant knee-jerk responses into something more life-promoting. So, why is it in the current medical practice to give you stomach acid suppressants for an ulcer, if you have become oversensitive to your mother-in-law's meddling in your household matters, now having somatized that bitterness into a physical ailment? Don't take all other possible cases for as ""comical"" as the above one, because people are developing cancers, diabetes, heart diseases, auto-immune diseases, and a plethora of other serious crap befalling them from chronic stresses at home, or at work, or due to their super sensitive nature to start with. Image by The Digital Artist from Pixabay Science is pure, right? But the more you get into the complex, value-laden problems of politics, the less it's true. -- Unknown As we are talking about stress being so detrimental to our health -- why not say that main aspect of it -- that our immune system goes weak with it, which then can give us anything from a hay fever to a cancer. A weakened immunity should stay in our focus here, which simply forces me to repeat some points from some of my previous articles on the same topic. Namely, let's talk about adrenalin, our stress hormone and how it negatively affects our immunity. I don't think there is a better way of doing it but by mentioning the organ transplants procedures, where patients are given extra dose of adrenaline, in order to suppress immune system which would otherwise reject the implanted organ as a ""foreign item in the body"". Stress hormone adrenaline used to suppress immunity?! That same hormone which has been marinating our bodies for the last two years with constant fearmongering by daily reports of all those infected and dead, and by all restrictions enforced, plus financial uncertainties for so many of us. Let me give you an extreme example, which you will never have to relate to -- but just to illustrate what a strong optimism and faith in good outcome, on the other hand, does for human immunity. Somewhere in the US there is this branch of Christians practicing their rituals by handling poisonous snakes. Every so often someone gets bitten -- but never ends up in hospital or dies. On top of that, their priest drinks strychnine, a known deadly substance, and doesn't die. Their mind, with a strong faith, converts the chemical structure of snake's venom and strychnine into something non-lethal, since it's a known fact that nervous and immune system work in a tandem, co-dependent on each other. Could we see the incredible connection between fear and immunity? Jobs and businesses lost, children and students deprived of education, plus financial uncertainties for so many people -- all created a massive paranoia and stress -- which calls for one big question: Since doctors knew all that so much better than I ever could -- namely, what stress does to the immunity -- why did they, and politicians, and the media as their instrument of propaganda, keep doing it to us for over two years? Again, couldn't they treat the situation the similar way as the yearly flu is treated, plus helping the affected ones with some pills, while letting the rest of the world live a normal life? I have said it elsewhere already, but think about it for a moment -- if the yearly flu had ever been as morbidly and persistently publicized as this virus has been, wouldn't we have heard of the same massive deaths from it? Like that holistic psychiatrist Dr. Kelly Brogan, MD said long ago: ""People are dying more of fear of the infection than from the infection itself as a direct cause."" Meaning that their, possibly already lower immunity, got further lowered by fearmongering -- at which point even a relatively weak virus could have been fatal to them. The old folks particularly were at risk, because of their already low immunity due to a lost zest for life, possible loneliness, and a diagnosis or two already working against them. But of course, the good doctor got promptly silenced, along with a number of renowned virologists who ""dared"" to oppose the mainstream protective measures, and either gave a different character to this virus, or claimed about vaccines to be potentially harmful, with the tests used ""not meant for infectious diseases at all"". If the authorities had known all along about the effects of stress on our immunity -- why did they insist on making the whole world go nuts in a constant fear? Shouldn't we see it as just priming the world for a gigantic sale of a product -- like vaccines and boosters -- by the old advertising formula of creating a need to create a demand? My wife and I are both 77 years young, and we had covid over the last Christmas holiday. Symptoms were similar to that one of a flu, minus fever -- just some coughing during day, without it overnight, a loss of taste and smell, some aches in muscles with getting tired fast. After treating it the usual way by drinking a lot of liquids, having a good rest, with some vitamins -- it was gone in about two weeks. In my own modest opinion, we were spared of any heavy symptoms with our not caring attitude over the whole duration of this pandemic. We are not scared of covid or any other bug, believing that any pathogen is only as dangerous as low is our immunity -- which we keep strong by this good stress management. And, by the way, we haven't been vaccinated at all, and are not planning to do it. Yes, many people have died. But ""how many"" -- that's another story. Every year, regardless of any pandemic, about 57 million people statistically die worldwide. So how many of those who would have died anyway, have been labeled as ""covid-19 victims? Well, I have never been a conspiracy theorist, and won't start it now. This post has been loaded with questions -- rather than statements -- albeit many of them were implying a logical answer. Some legit questions that anyone of a non-corrupted, non-brainwashed mind could ask. So, where are we today after all these lockdowns, masks, and the rest, if the number of those fully vaccinated in hospitals is increasing? And, finally, what is really the logic in allowing people to go to restaurants and busy shopping malls without a proof of a vaccination -- but demanding those proofs at the airports? Also, again, what ""science"" is still enforcing restrictions in some countries, while not in others? But, well, this is not a unique case of authorities, whether medical or political not making any sense -- except the one supporting the sales of vaccines and boosters.

9,Why Walmart Is Bad for America,politics," Walmart logo Unsplash In 1962, Walmart came into existence as a discount store in the state of Arkansas. In 1970, the company was traded on OTC markets and later began trading on NYSE in 1972. The company then grew quickly and owned over 270 stores in 11 states in a decade, and in 1991, the company had become an international company. Currently, Walmart serves over 130 million customers in a week, as well as employs up to 1.6 million people, and receives as much as $312.4 billion from its sales. Just like any other big company, Walmart has had its share of legal issues and criticism from the public. Walmart is accused of underpaying its employees, and some of them have even lodged complaints about international trade disputes. Given its global success, Walmart ought to have had better offers to its employees and cleared all accusations such as environmental violations; discrimination among others, then giving the idea the company is not as good for America as expected. There are accusations about Walmart including the fact that it drives down the wages of the employees and the company is responsible for increasing the public health care costs. The Walton family, which is the co-founder of the Walmart Company, is accused of donating a lot of money to politics and mostly towards the Republicans. The company is accused of manipulating its suppliers and convincing them to accept unfair contracts, as they also do not encourage promotion and growth for their workers. The company seems to oppose the policies that streamline links that aim at organizing and environmental protection. There are accusations that Walmart is purchasing the majority of its products from foreign countries, specifically China, which also gives the customers an advantage as it lowers the prices of goods. However, with their business with China, the country has more advantage because when Walmart manufactures goods there; the country’s economy grows, hence creating a larger middle class for China. By preferring manufacturing in China and other foreign countries, Walmart has led to the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States (Basker 178). Therefore, this would mean that it would be fair to assume that Walmart must be one of the causative reasons why America’s production industry has lost its strength in the global market. When it comes to retail business, Walmart sets the bar, and many businesses that would want to maintain their successes have to follow the route that the leader, Walmart takes. One of the ways that these businesses follow Walmart is by having their stores modeled just like Walmart (Basker 181). Walmart stores contain everything that someone can require from electronics, tires, supplies, groceries, and beauty products, among other things. By having almost everything in a store, Walmart aims at ensuring that the customers find everything at once and at a lower price, which is what defines the company’s philosophy. Therefore, with the popularity of Walmart and its philosophy other stores have considered taking the same approach. However, one challenge that Walmart has undergone is that all the other competitors have taken up the same approach and lowered the prices of their products too, which is good for the customers but not for Walmart. To remain competitive, Walmart has had to cut on the employees’ benefits, cut back on the labor and prefer cheaper manufacturers, hence choosing China and other foreign countries. Similarly, the suppliers also have to reduce their costs of tendering to secure contracts with Walmart, which forces these supply companies to lay off the majority of their employees. Back home in America, those manufacturing companies that previously handled the contracts with companies such as Walmart lost their jobs. The companies had the majority of the middle class in the country, but the jobs were moved to the foreign countries rendering them jobless (Baker, 180). It means that the majority had their annual earnings reduced significantly. The housing market has to categorically go down, as the majority cannot afford to pay for the houses with their minimum wages. Therefore, Walmart has greatly affected the economy of the country negatively by choosing to manufacture its products abroad in China, while improving that of the foreign country (Quinn). Additionally, the US labor laws are also quite restrictive, while the other countries may not have quite as strict laws like that as the US. Walmart chose to send its manufacturers to China because of the cheap cost and less strict laws. In China, they also managed to get cheap labor, but the situation changed as those laborers realized that they offered their services cheaply and decided to demand high wages. Hence, with higher wages for the workers, the country’s economy has a majority of them belonging to the middle class. When these Chinese workers started to work, they did not make as much money, but with that change, the workers started living decent lives.  It is evident that Walmart managed to improve the livelihood of the workers, as well as contribute to the country’s growing economy; on the other hand, it means that America is getting a raw deal. Walmart employs many people, and they are most diverse, young, old, disabled, and others with no college degrees. However, because some of them are helpless and cannot defend themselves, most are recruited as part-time employees, without health coverage. Therefore, it is common that it is difficult for the employees to advance, that is to be promoted to upper management. Walmart seems to frustrate its employees, as they employ them only as part-timers knowing that they are not guaranteed pay benefits or even payment for overtime. The payment that the employees receive is also low, and some of the former employees who resigned argue that one cannot find a career while working for the company. In such conditions, employees would only decide to keep their jobs because they need them. In conclusion, Walmart might have some good such as availing products at a cheaper cost to the customers and availing of different products in one place. However, I think that the negatives outdo the positives, making it harmful to the country. Walmart, like other large stores, devastates other stores by dominating the market and hurting other businesses due to their presence. Second, Walmart has widened the trade deficit between the United States and China and seems to focus more on the profit they are to make than the economy of their host nation and its people. Thirdly, their strategy of preferring low cost for their products and making high profits destroys the nation’s economic stability given it is a big contributor to the economy given its size. The company should also consider improving the status of its employees, given that it is a large corporation known globally in order to improve its reputation.  Basker, Emek.

10,"Community Capitals Framework Case Study Report: McDowell County, West Virginia",politics," Credit: Tanya Dusett McDowell County, West Virginia is a collection of small cities and unincorporated communities on the southern border of the state. It was once the region that produced the most coal in the entire United States (Visit Southern WV). Coal is extracted from deep below the surface of the Earth as a natural resource before being refined into industrial metals. The steel and iron made from McDowell County coal were vital in meeting the demand for those metals in World War I and World War II (Visit Southern WV). Trains, electricity, and heat were all primarily dependent on coal beginning with the Industrial Revolution and spanning over half of the 20th century. Spikes in the amount of traded coal have occurred as recently as the mid-2000s. Mcdowell county’s population during the peak of coal production fluctuated between 90,000 and 100,000 people during the years between 1930 and 1950 (1950 Census)(McDowell County). The population as of April 1, 2020, was 19,111 (McDowell County). The major decreases in population size and economic stability have been attributed to multiple factors; drug use and the coal industry being the primary offenders. McDowell County reported the most drug-induced deaths of any other county in the United States in 2015 (Rudd et al.). The coal industry dictates the level of employment in Mcdowell County, and quite a few physical battles have been waged between the miners and coal companies since the turn of the 20th century. As the coal industry smolders out and corporations move their businesses elsewhere, McDowell County’s economy absorbs the impact. The United States Department of Agriculture considers McDowell County a food desert - a region where a majority of the population has low access to supermarkets or large grocery stores (Hudson). The purpose of this case study is to identify and analyze cited statistics from McDowell County, West Virginia by utilizing the community capitals framework. Doing so will highlight which aspects of the capitals have played a part in the development of social problems and which aspects can build a solution. McDowell County possesses many characteristics of the capitals framework within its communities. Natural Capital, by far, is the capital that has maintained the most influence on the region. Coal mining is the identity associated with McDowell County. Natural Capital in West Virginia had such a powerful influence in the early to mid 20th century that it shaped educational, social, and healthcare institutions (Server)(Wheeler). Social capital has deep roots in McDowell County although it was long ago when mutual trust and shared identity were common. Today, social capital is nearly nonexistent in the region as crime increases, poverty becomes more widespread, and collective identity is reserved to hope of escaping the pressure of the coal industry’s labor monopolization (Wheeler). However, that glimmer of hope is not insignificant - social capital was utilized to empower the largest and most effective insurrection in the United States since the Civil War (Wheeler). A clear distinction in the community’s use of social capital came when coal miners from nearby counties joined the original effort based on a shared identity. Social capital was generated through bonding social capital and bridging social capital considering that a social movement was developed within their community and expanded among other groups with a shared identity (Flora et al.). The movement was curbed through institutional sanctions on the group protesting the norm of long hours and low pay along with a lack of safety. The potential for revitalized social capital is present in this region. Human capital in McDowell county is diminished by the lack of a strong foundation in cultural capital. Without development in human capital, built capital and financial capital will continue to suffer. McDowell County has poor infrastructure and only 28.2% of citizens 16 years of age and older were in the civilian labor force (US Census Bureau). The significance of poor human capital is evident in the fact that McDowell County had the highest rate of drug-induced overdose deaths of any county in the United States in 2015 (Malatras). Social inequality generated by the absence of cultural capital has decimated the county as up-and-coming members of the community have little to no chance of participating in social bridging. The effectiveness of shared cultural capital is based on the reality that there can be no development of social bonding capital, and therefore social bridging capital, without it (Flora et al.). As was previously addressed, although there is potential for each of the capitals to thrive in this region, there is insufficient opportunity to harness it. hangela Prescription opioid abuse, the effect of the coal industry, and poverty are the three most detrimental social problems that have plagued this region. These issues are directly linked to the neglect of natural and cultural capital in the pursuit of financial capital. As previously mentioned, McDowell County once boasted a population of 100,000 and distributed resources that impacted the largest wars in modern human history. However, the mass migration of tens of thousands of coal miners away from the area has left McDowell county impoverished. Generation Z and Millennials are feeling the impact even more so than their forefathers; 2019 Census data shows that although 1 in 3, or 33.2%, of McDowell County residents are living in poverty, residents aged 18-34 make up 51.8% of those living below the poverty line compared to 30.3% of residents who were 34-65 years of age (US Census Bureau). Natural and financial capital were prioritized in this region with origins in the fact that McDowell County became vastly populated as a result of the coal industry and the job opportunities it offered. Cultural capital was neglected in pursuit of other capitals, leading to massive inequality there. Long hours, no age restrictions, and low pay contributed to the decrease in cultural capital that began a downward spiral. Education, health, and cultural competence are second in priority to coal production. Furthermore, the coal industry holds a monopoly on a majority of the few jobs available that offer a living wage, which singularizes the set of skills that most McDowell County residents are expected to learn. Cultural capital will continue to be nonexistent here while there are no cultural expectations that success is likely outside of that requested skill set. Financial capital exists in the region but the citizens mostly produce it through labor rather than collecting its benefits. Drug addiction is a key component in understanding the range of social problems in this region. Its spread has been facilitated by the absence of access to social and human capital. Addiction occurs when the brain’s reward system is overtaken by the need for a specific substance or feeling that acts as an auxiliary for a human need that can’t be achieved, like a strong relationship with both parents. In McDowell County, social capital was built through the Protestant work ethic. When managed successfully, human capital would naturally follow as social capital was increased through positive perception in the community associated with labor. Employment was a major norm for men that dictated how honorably they were viewed within their community while women exhausted their labor at home in the form of raising large numbers of children, cleaning, cooking, gardening, and whatever other chores existed around the property. Only around 4,000 residents out of over 18,000 were actively employed in the last survey of 2019; meaning more than 3 out of 4 people are not employed in a region where labor was once the primary source of identity - compared to the current national average of 3.8% (US Census Bureau). The correlation with drug addiction is clear. Generations of residents whose parents identified with their work have been tasked with navigating an identity that has no modern cultural capital to draw from or social capital to bestow. Human capital won’t be present without the development of those two capitals as a prerequisite. McDowell County residents have no cultural capital and therefore no ability to increase their access to social or human capital. Natural Capital has created a social problem in McDowell County due to the nature of privatization. Even though there is an abundance of coal, laborers and residents struggle with poverty and health. Most of the benefits derived from local labor are enjoyed by corporations and executives so that the financial capital does not circulate through the local economy. According to the New York Times, from 2004 to 2016, coal executive pay increased 500% on average while coal miner pay increased at a rate of 11% (Tabuchi). Greed combined with the abundance of natural capital has resulted in major inequality, a characteristic of poor access to cultural capital. While labor monopolization and addiction are major contributors to the downfall of McDowell County in terms of population and capital, these problems also allow for straightforward solutions. Even though US coal consumption peaked around 2008 it has been on a steady decline since that time. The salary of one top coal industry CEO would fund the retraining of every West Virginia coal miner making a transition into renewable energy jobs (Tabuchi). Some residents, including former industry employees and their children, identify with coal so strongly that they refuse to support any measure that would limit or erase influence by the coal companies. Political capital has been an effective weapon of the industry for over a century regardless of strong social labor movements that transcended barriers of the time. The miners were primarily immigrants and poor Americans who lived in communities made up of company-owned homes and were paid in a currency that was only valid in company stores located within the coal camp (Timberlake). Total control was maintained over the lives of the miners living in coal camps and private law enforcement physically threw out those who didn’t abide by the company policies that dictated norms (Timberlake). The ensuing labor movement was strengthened by a shared identity among social groups combined with the support of trade unions who strongly identified with workers too. For political capital to be increased contemporarily, those roots of shared identity and future must develop into a response to the amount of political capital that coal companies have access to. The reality is that increasing social capital in McDowell County isn’t easy, but it can be done if social movements reminiscent of those in the past are utilized to force an expedited change in the balance of political capital. Unfortunately, West Virginia legislation and its enforcement have evolved heavily in favor of the industry, which justifies why developing political capital isn’t a realistic option for residents. To be even more clear - the last time that a major social movement in West Virginia aimed to reduce the coal industry’s impact, they were met with assault, shooting from militarized weapons, and even decommissioned military aircraft that dropped homemade bombs down on to miners (AP Corporate Archives). 16 people died as a result of the fighting (AP Corporate Archives). The plague of addiction that has blanketed McDowell County comes as a result of unbridled access to what Hope and Help WV classifies as prescription opioids prescribed to opioid-naive patients (West Virginia Board of Pharmacy). Paired with the high rates of unemployment and poverty, the factors for a crisis have always been present in this region. West Virginia is considered to be one of the top 3 states in depression rate along with Oregon and Maine. No in-depth analysis needs to take place to understand why opioids would end up having such a profound effect on a population battling identity loss, poverty, and a mental health crisis that surpasses the capability of any modern US state healthcare system. Controlled medications such as benzodiazepine relax the user and mediate the amount of anxiety and stress that they feel, but are also inherently addictive. According to Hope and Help, in 2019, 43% of residents were estimated to have a controlled substance prescription, 31.5% with an opioid prescription, and 16.5% with a benzodiazepine prescription (West Virginia Board of Pharmacy). There is nothing organic about the drug epidemic that now consumes the region; it is a result of a deliberate and meticulous campaign by pharmaceutical companies who wished to earn more profit at the expense of already-impoverished communities. Their poverty, created through the drive for financial capital and the abuse of natural capital by the coal industry, was exploited even further by overprescribing narcotics. Any initial campaign that would aim to eliminate opioid dependence in McDowell County would also be taking on corporate interests in the area that render citizens powerless. There is existing litigation against Teva Pharmaceuticals, Johnson and Johnson, and Endo Health Solutions brought on by the State of West Virginia Attorney General’s Office that alleges these corporations violated multiple laws when downplaying the addictive effects of painkillers to doctors who would later ignite the crisis through overprescription (Adams). The conversations are on the verge of a settlement as 54 out of 55 West Virginia counties have agreed to the terms so far, where an organization will be founded and funded by the State in order to distribute the settlement funds to affected communities. The primary solution that should be considered involves more legal action; pharmaceutical and coal companies that statistically played a part in addiction and poverty in McDowell County to advance their financial capital should be responsible for restoring the lost capital in the region. Built capital created through financial capital would have the most significant impact on this community. Schools, businesses, and medical facilities are of essential priority to revamp the cultural capital of McDowell County. The importance of creating stable labor opportunities (such as the labor needed to install built capital) can not be overstated concerning these communities. The Attorney General of West Virginia could affect significant change in these communities by ensuring that these corporations have no influence over the recovery of local communities and by utilizing that financial capital specifically to undo the damage caused by their pursuit of profit.  stevepb The goal of this case study, reiterated, is to identify and analyze statistics from McDowell County, West Virginia using the community capitals framework. McDowell County holds many rural communities which, although containing many residential structures, were primarily developed to ensure labor was available in a rural area to extract natural resources. There are urban centers located throughout the county such as Welch, Bradshaw, and Iaeger. Identified capitals that have the potential to be expanded upon include natural capital and social capital. Social capital has historically been mobilized in the region to resist the further reduction of human and labor rights. Natural capital and financial capital have played significant roles in the underdevelopment of McDowell County. Capitals that have the potential to revitalize the community include financial capital, built capital, and restructuring of access to social capital that doesn’t require a significant commitment to labor by the individual. Applying the Community Capitals Framework allows for the organization of social problems and their causes into segments of an “equation” that can be arranged in order to more easily identify the structure of social problems. The organization from the framework is crucial in forming solutions that consider the entire context of the community without critical issues becoming more or less important. Rather, CCF allows for a linear analysis that highlights which capitals will be most effective in a certain order. Rather than prioritizing one or two solutions, the order of the solution is prioritized so that every capital and its effects must be reviewed and considered equally. For example, instead of hypothesizing that McDowell county needs more jobs, the CCF identifies preceding and succeeding factors that give context and direction to the process that will be required to solve not only that specific social problem but its lingering subsidiaries as well. Based on the capital available to McDowell County citizens, a settlement or legal obligation with the pharmaceutical and coal industries where the stolen financial capital can be recirculated through the community is the most realistic contemporary capital solution. The extremely poor infrastructure of McDowell County requires that built capital be prioritized once financial capital is accessed. Without financial resolution between the State and these industries, there is little chance that built capital will increase, leaving residents to remain in indefinite poverty while unemployed. If built capital is realized, it opens a multitude of possibilities to see social, human, and cultural capital make a comeback in McDowell County, akin to the days when 100,000 laborers and their families with a shared identity called the region home and contemptuously battled corporate interests. Personally utilizing the CCF in a region with deep emotional ties has underscored its validity as an objectively useful sociological tool.

11,AMERICA'S WAR AGAINST THE JEWS,politics," Dr. Allen E. Goldenthal is the author of the Kahana Chronicles series of books available on Amazon in paperback and Kindle versions A couple of days ago, Jews around the world remembered all those that died during the Holocaust of World War II on Yom Ha Shoah.  If you only paid attention to the standard media, you might have missed it, as the amount of time attributed to this solemn day was at best, ‘minimal’.  Minimalization of Jewish interests seems to be a common trend nowadays.  I notice on my Facebook, I am sent connections to new Palestinian support sites on an almost daily basis.   I never asked for it, I never requested them, but FB seems determined to try and make me interested in them none-the-less.   The loading of these sites on my FB seemed unusually heavy; around this time of Holocaust Remembrance Day.   It doesn’t surprise me, because America’s War Against the Jews has always been present and was never more obvious than their complicity in aiding the Nazi Regime of Germany and its attempted extermination of the Jews. “Oh No!” you say.  America was the liberator of the Camps.  “It fought hard to protect the Jews of Europe throughout the war.  Franklin D. Roosevelt was the Jew’s best friend and ally during the war.” Yes, they preached that and Jews around the world swallowed it, especially those living in America.  As a result, Jews felt they owed a debt to the Democratic party and have been voting en masse for the DNC ever since.   But the truth is, they have been lied to.  They have been conned and many are either too ignorant or too lazy to investigate the facts themselves.   So, I’m going to do them the favour of presenting the facts to them.  I know there will be howls of objection and accusations of False News, when they start reading this article.   If that’s the case, then don’t bother to read it.  Don’t try to seek to the truth and remain in your delusion of all things are wonderful in America, Jews are loved and always have been in America, and America is Israel’s best friends.  All the while the anti-Semitic attacks increase on a daily basis as Palestinians (a non-existent entity that were only given an identity in 1964) march in the streets with their snowflake supporters calling for your deaths.   If this accurately describes you, then stop reading now because you’re a lost cause.   I only want to deal in facts, not the fantasy world you have created as you look out the window of your New York apartment singing It’s a Beautiful Day. American Nazi Propaganda America never wanted to fight on the European front. In fact, American industry and financial corporation were responsible for building the Nazi war machine. Don’t want to believe it, then let me tell you the FACTS. Everything I’m about to say is documented, verified and recognized as the truth, but every attempt has been made to bury the information, even by Jewish apologists that don’t want people to know about America’s role in the genocide. I will admit that President Franklin Roosevelt had a tough situation attempting to rebuild America after the depression and that was his primary responsibility during those years, but as was written by journalist Freda Kirchwey during the first months of 1943 to the American people, “You and I and the President and the Congress and the State Department are accessories to the crime and share Hitler’s guilt. If we had behaved like human and generous people instead of complacent, cowardly one, the two million Jews lying today in the earth of Poland and Hitler’s other crowded graveyards would be alive and safe…We had it in our power to rescue this doomed people and did not lift a hand to do it –or perhaps it would be fairer to say that we lifted just one cautious hand, encased in a tight-fitting glove of quotas and visas and affidavits and a thick layer of prejudice.” If only Freda Kirchwey had known the real extent of FDR’s activity in permitting the active support of the Third Reich, I think she would have written a far more blistering and condemning article. When the first news reports of Kristallnacht in 1938 surfaced, some reporters in the USS called for quick action to rescue Germany’s Jews before it was too late. At least let the 15.000 German Jewish child refugees into the country. The Roosevelt administration said ‘No’ without further explanation. In fact, FDR and his administration reacted in the exact opposite way. In 1941 they made a new immigration regulation that barred admission to anyone with close relatives in Europe on the grounds that the Nazis might force these immigrants to spy for them by threatening their relatives that remained behind. Yes, these tailors, merchants, shopkeepers and children would definitely be spy material, sneaking into American military installations and stealing confidential information as they delivered food, etc., to the bases. Of all the excuses, this was one of the most ridiculous but one that America had raised in the refugee conference in Evian-les-Bains, France back in 1938 as a reason to take a harsh stance against immigration. America didn’t want anyone taking in these Jewish refugees, although FDR did suggest that perhaps these Jews could be sent to Africa or South America. It was obvious that he had absolutely no desire to bring them to America or any other part of what he considered the civilized world. As ridiculous as the Jewish spy threat sounds, FDR wanted to ensure that the lie would be given maximum circulation and at a press conference on June 5, 1940 stated, “Now, of course, the refugee has got to be checked because, unfortunately, among the refugees there are some spies, as has been found in other countries. And not all of them are voluntary spies – it is rather a horrible story but in some of the other countries that refugees out of Germany have gone to, especially JEWISH refugees, they found a number of definitely proven spies.” At that moment FDR had essentially sealed the doom of the six million Jews that would eventually die in the Holocaust. The reality that FDR prioritized economic recovery over Jewish lives is quite evident.  It was not as if the American public was not aware of Germany’s attacks on the Jews beginning in 1933.  There were petitions and marches in the US calling on the new Roosevelt administration to do something, even if it was just a mild condemnation of the Nazis.   But the risk was too great as Germany still owed billions of dollars to American investors after they rebuilt the country after World War I and FDR needed those same investors to put money into his coffers to rebuild America after the Great Depression.  William Dodd, the ambassador in Berlin was told by FDR that the Jewish issue in Germany was not a US government affair and therefore he should say nothing.   As a matter of interest, Dodd was recalled from Germany in 1938 after Kristallnacht and for the duration of the war there was never an ambassador in Germany making it impossible to get first hand reports and directly communicate objections to Hitler.  As matters became worse for Jews in Germany, tens of thousands began to file to immigrate to the United States.  The US set its annual immigration number at 153,774 and 50% of these spots were to be allocated to the United Kingdom.  Of the remaining slots, no single country was to make up more than 27,370,   Then the FDR administration added on economic restrictions to immigrants so that less than 20% of the German quota was being filled.   The Democratic Party knew exactly what it was doing.  It was assigning practically all of Germany’s Jews to persecution, prosecution and even death.   It became even worse once the Nazis occupied and annexed Austria.  Roosevelt changed the immigration policy so that Germany and Austrian refugees were considered as one and therefore restricted to a single 27,370 quota.   The quota was filled for the first time to its maximum in 1939 but never reached that level again, with most being turned away and told there was a waiting list for ten years.  The old excuse that the President did not know that Hitler intended to exterminate the Jews is another lie perpetrated by the US government to shield themselves from the backlash that Jews would and should have had against the entire Democratic Party.   By November 1942, the State Department was well aware of the Final Solution.  Their response was to have eleven allied governments issue a declaration condemning the atrocities and promising to punish the perpetrators after the war.  At this time, the allies were even certain they were going to win the war, which had all been in Germany’s favour at that time and Hitler was extremely confident that he’d be the one exercising any post-war punishments.  But what these eleven governments were actually saying in this letter was that they’d be very upset if Hitler went ahead and eliminated every Jew in Europe and they’d think of a fitting punishment should they win the war.  That was hardly a threat that would stop Adolph Hitler. When pressured by Jewish groups in 1943 to do something, FDR responded by holding a conference in Bermuda, in April 1943.  Other than relaxing on the beaches and drinking pina coladas, the conference resulted in no actions undertaken.  Later in July, an eye witness to the Warsaw ghetto, Jan Karski, met with Roosevelt and described the horrors.   FDR arranged for Karski to talk with others in the Cabinet but once again, no action was undertaken.    But the pressure increased as the public became more aware, and FDR did what every Democratic President does when the polls aren’t looking too favourable; you go get a public relations groups to rebuild your image. FDR’s reputation as a savior of the Jews was the result of this media propaganda effort circulated by the Bergson Group which was involved in the formation of the War Refugee Board.” They proclaimed the board as FDR’s greatest accomplishment in bringing about its creation.   As the Bergson Group sponsored legislation in Congress to establish the rescue agency, FDR feared the open hearings would result in Jewish groups testifying how the State Department had actually obstructed efforts to rescue European Jews.    Faced with an embarrassing situation, FDR used executive privilege to create the WRB on January 22, 1944, and thereby bypass the need for the Congressional hearings.   The efforts of the WRB were lukewarm at best, tasked with the mission to carry out a new American Policy o rescuing and providing relief for the Jews and other groups persecuted by the Nazis.  They sent radio broadcasts into Nazi-occupied Europe, and dropped leaflets on the territories, all threating post-war punishments to all those that committed war crimes.  It did get some countries to take in refugees after the war, but once again it was a case of too little, too late.  Notice the timing of the WRB’s creation.  By the time it was up and running, the war in Europe was ending just over a year later.  Much of the damage had already been done, with millions killed and the death camps fully operational. One of their projects was to investigate the bombing of the rail lines, the gas chambers and the crematoriums at the concentration camps.   But that idea was quickly nixed by the American Military and the State Department. The war effort was needed elsewhere and therefore redirecting bombing flights to destroy the railway lines and roads into Auschwitz could not be considered at that time.   Once again, this excuse was nothing more than a lie.  As George McGovern stated in 2004 that he was a young bomber pilot had to fly missions over Auschwitz to attack industrial plants close by and it would have been so easy to have blasted those rail lines off the face of the earth and interrupted the flow of people to the death chambers.  All of the gas ovens could have been taken out if the order had been given.   The industrial plant he was referring to was I.G.Farben, in nearby Monowitz.   In the six months between July and the end of November 1944, the bombing raids of German oil factories took 2800 planes over the Birkenau death camp.   To say that not even one bomb could be spared to bomb the camps infrastructure of death is a colossal lie.  Oh, there was the excuse that there may have been collateral damage and some of the Jewish prisoner may have been hurt.  Really?  These people were all marked for death in the most horrific fashion. Injuring some in order to save thousands would have been a blessing.  The truth is, FDR and his Cabinet did not wish to stop the slaughter of Jews.   As they did to the cruise ship, the St. Louis, known as the Voyage of the Damned, in 1939, they made it clear to Hitler that they would not make the effort to save even a few hundred Jews that knew they would be killed if their ship was turned back to Germany.  A single Executive order or an Act of Congress could have saved everyone aboard that ship.  Now one might say the ship was also refused entry by Cuba, Great Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, but that was only after the US made it clear that it was not necessary to save the Jews. Thus far I’ve been discussing the sins of a Democratic President and his Cabinet but what was their motivation.  Why would they try to stay out o the war in Europe as long as possible, and do as little as they could to condemn the Germans and rescue the Jewish populations?  The answer to that question might not be as difficult as some would like to make it.  As I mentioned at the start of the article, America was attempting to rebuild its industries following the Great Depression.  In order to do so, it was going to take money, an awful lot of money.    Roosevelt knew that he would be heavily reliant on the established industries and financial houses in the USA in order to accomplish his New Deal.  That meant in some ways placing the office of the President subservient to some of these industrial boards.  Not that different from Joe Biden being in the pockets of the Chinese Communist Party except where Biden’s motivation is amassing personal wealth, FDR does seem to be genuinely motivated in rebuilding America.   But once you find yourself tied to corporate industry, then the President must turn a blind eye to those industries deemed essential in creating the American recovery.  Companies like General Motors and Ford, IBM, Woolworths, Coca Cola and many others that untouchable and used that status to help build up the German war effort.  Even after the war began, their subsidiaries in German and Europe continued to generate profits by supporting the Nazis.  Most Americans probably don’t even realize that both Ford and GM sued the US government for million in reparations for damages that their plants suffered from US bombings, even though those same plants were in full production for the Nazis and the companies received the profits.  GM even built a factory in Berlin for the sole purpose of manufacturing Blitz Trucks for the purpose of taking over countries.  Ford tried to manufacture the trucks as well but the GM product was the main one used for the conquest of Poland, France and areas of the Soviet Union.   Albert Speer, Hitler’s minister of armaments even gave credit to GM for providing the rubber that made their offensive so successful.   Henry Ford made it no secret that he supported Hitler, accepting Germanys Highest Award for a Foreigner, and part of the committee of the America First Association which advocated that the US stays out of WWII.     The fact that the Nazis had provided the Ford Factory in Cologne with 1200 Russian slaves, was never considered disgraceful enough that this man should not have the ear of the President.  Between GM and Ford, they had both ears and as long as they were permitted to make money in Germany, they would continue to pump money into Roosevelt’s New Deal and restore the economy.  But it wasn’t just these car makers but ALCOA as well.  As the then largest aluminum producer in the world, it not only had a monopoly on the metal but also owned a tremendous amount of America’s electrical production.  So much of ALCOA’s aluminum production went to Germany for its war machine that when America finally joined the war, it has a shortage. Of course, wherever there is money to be made, you don’t have to look very far to find Coca Cola.   When America finally entered into the war, the hundreds of Coca Cola plants in Germany were cut off from American support.  Rather than shut down, their CEO in Germany, Max Keith, rebranded the drink as ‘FANTA’ for Reich consumption, guaranteed to provide German soldiers with the energy require to continue the fight.   After the war, Fanta just took its ill-gotten wealth and reunited it with the coffers of Coca Cola. Roosevelt was not only heavily reliant on the manufacturing industries to rebuild America through employment and production but he also needed investors like J.P. Morgan Co., with its affiliate, Chase Bank.   Carlos Niedermann, Chase’s Paris executive had close personal relationships with Key Nazis and when asked, was more than happy to oblige their request to seize the assets of at least one hundred of Paris’s richest Jews.  At the same time, it identified them and let the Gestapo take them into custody.   In 1998 J.P Morgan was finally made to pay out reparations to the survivors of those they robbed but at a rate of two hundred dollars a month, it was a joke. It may not be anyone’s surprise, but one of the biggest collaborators with the Nazis was Dow Chemical.   Not only did they provide raw materials but also American technology in oil refining. The technologies created much of the German was machine’s superiority in traveling distances at high speed.    But as Dow was essential for the rebuilding of industries in the American Midwest and hiring thousands of people, it was deemed acceptable by FDR to not consider their German efforts as treasonous. Some of us may recall the company Woolworth’s.  Sort of the Walmart store of the 1960s.  The Woolworth family, being one of the richest in America was essential to FDR for financing his New Deal and rebuilding America.   Whereas in today’s world Walmart is a key distributor for Chinese made goods, Woolworth stores served that purpose for German made goods in the 1930s and 40s.  So, when the Nazis asked Woolworths to fire all of its Jewish employees they didn’t hesitate in doing so, earning them the Adefa Zeichen award for being a pure Aryan company.  The family was already known to be anti-Semitic but now it was being permitted to openly display that hatred with the approval of the American president. Most callous of all was International Business Machines, known better as IBM.  Not only are there documents showing IBM collaborating with the Nazis and training them how to use their machines to record the movement, sorting and mass execution of large numbers of undesirables based on the tattooed numbers of the victims, they were willing to do that training right in the concentration camps. Once again, most of us that are of an older generation will remember Kodak.  Couldn’t get much more American then Eastman Kodak except that during the war they used their subsidiaries in neutral countries such as Switzerland and Portugal to do business with Germany.  An act which was greatly appreciated by the Nazis who in return let Kodak control their German branches.  Purchasing large amounts of photographic equipment made in Germany, Kodak helped finance the Nazi war machine.  At the same time Kodak equipment, chemicals and innovative de vices were sold to the Nazis to help their war effort.    Another documented fact is that the Kodak German branch used 250 slave laborers, for which they paid half a million dollars into a fund for those families they used as slaves. Defenders of FDR might say that this couldn’t be possible, since he passed the War Profiteering Act which made it impossible for American companies to do business with the enemy.   But as these documented facts prove, not only was it possible but it was very profitable.  Roosevelt needed cooperation and support of industry and finance and that meant dealing with the devil.  But dealing with the devil also meant he couldn’t interfere with Germany’s plans to eradicate the Jews.  He provided them with that guarantee to the point that they would only be punished or it after the war.  That amounts to a green light.  When we look back at the Holocaust we cannot ignore the fact that it was not just a crime of the Nazis, but it was aided and abided by the Democratic leadership of America, from the President downwards.  It was not a case of indifference but an active decision not to interfere or intervene and stop the slaughter before it ever happened.  Evil is not solely the responsibility of the perpetrator but is also the crime of those that condone it and silently support it.   America made a conscious decision to let the Jews of Europe die.  The facts don’t just suggest it, they demonstrate it.   And as a new generation of Americans come of age, they share none of that guilt for what their grandparents or great-grandparents did to the Jews and they are willing to display their rabid anti-Semitism once again.  And who should be leading that reawakening of hatred of religious-racism, none other than the Democratic Party under Joe Biden.  Wake up Jews of America and understand that ‘Never Again’ only has meaning if you are willing to cut the head off the demon before it has a chance to reach its full maturity.

12,"The Legacy of Mwai Kibaki, the Third President of Kenya",politics," Hon. Mwai Kibaki at the London Conference on Somalia Wikipedia On the morning of Friday April 22, 2022, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced the death of the former president of the Republic of Kenya, Mwai Kibaki. Emilio Stanley Mwai Kibaki, popularly known as Mwai Kibaki, is revered for having resuscitated Kenya's economy that had declined drastically, ushering in free primary education and revised Kenya constitution, revitalising the health sector, boosting infrastructure and other social services. The 2010 constitution is remarked as Kibaki's most noteworthy achievement. The revised constitution was meant to ""reduce the excessive power vested in the presidency, decentralise government and bring it closer to the people through devolution."" Other changes that were made ""included the independence of judiciary, a bicameral legislatures creation of independent institutions, enhanced fight against corruption, gender equality and a well laid out transitional process."" (The Standard Newspaper) When Kibaki took the office on December 2002, Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP) was at its lowest - 0.5%. Under his leadership, Kenya's GDP grew from 2.9% in 2003 to 5.1% in 2004, 5.9% in 2005, 6.4% in 2006, and 6.8% in 2007. According to Business Daily Africa newspaper, the economic gain that was experienced during Kibaki's first term tumbled to 0.2% following the 2007 post-election violence and the global financial crisis of 2008. However, the GDP spiked to 3.3% in 2009 and 8% in 2010. The East African newspaper states when Kibaki took over from Moi, the revised economic data released by World Bank-funded Kenya Open Data Project on the Internet in 2011 reveals ""Kenya was starting to recover from the trough of a decade-long economic decline induced by a debilitating toll of grand corruption that sapped public finances and the resulting shocks induced by massive cuts in economic aid."" Kibaki was born on November 1931 in Gatuyaini village, Nyeri County, to peasant farmers, Kibaki Gîthînji and Teresia Wanjiku. He was the youngest of the eight children in the family. He attended Mang'u High school (1947-1950) after completing his primary education, and earned a scholarship to study at Makerere University, Uganda. He enrolled for a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Economics, History and Political Science; graduating from the university (1955) with a First Class Honours. He worked briefly as an assistant general manager at Shell Company of East Africa, Uganda, before earning a scholarship to study for a postgraduate degree at any university in Britain. He chose to study at London School of Economics; graduating in 1958 with a distinction in Bachelor of Science in Public Finance. From 1958-1961, Kibaki taught at Makere University as an assistant lecturer in the economics department. President Moi and Bush Wikipedia One of the longest serving politicians in Kenya, Kibaki joined politics in 1960 after resigning from his teaching job at Makerere. His first political job was as an executive officer of Kenya African National Union (KANU). He served in various capacities in both Kenyatta's and Moi's governments. Kibaki also served as Vice-president following the death of Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta. In 1963, Kibaki became a first-time Member of Parliament; clinching the seat for Donholm Constituency in Nairobi. Years later, he relocated his political base to Nyeri where he contested for the same political position for Othaya Constituency. He won the seat, in 1974, and since then, Kibaki managed to be elected back as Member of Parliament for Othaya Constituency until 2007 when he retired from politics. Back then during Moi's regime, Kibaki was both a loyalist to Moi's government and the ruling party, KANU. He mocked the concept of multipartism. It came as a surprise to many when he resigned from his civil post and left the ruling party to form his own party, Democratic Party (DP). Confrontation between Kibaki and Moi on political matters saw Kibaki being moved from holding the ministerial position of finance to home affairs. Further fallout between the two culminated to Kibaki being stripped of his position as Vice-president and moved to the ministry of health docket. He contested for the presidential seat twice - 1992 and 1997 - but lost to the second president of Kenya, Danie Moi. The following year, Kibaki became the leader of opposition. Prior to 2002 General Election, Kibaki's political party, DP, joined hands with another alliance party, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and several other parties to form an umbrella party - the National Alliance of Rainbow Coalition (NARC). It's through the alliance thag Kibaki was able to emerge as the winner in the 2002 General Election. He gathered 62% of the votes while KANU's candidate, Uhuru Kenyatta, came second. Tens of thousands of Kenyans including national and international dignitaries attended the swearing-in ceremony of the third president of Kenya. The ceremony marked the end of Moi's 24-years iron-fist rule, and the end of the ruling political party, KANU, four-decades dominance in the political arena from when the country gained independence from their colonialist, Britain. The 2007-post election violence tainted Kibaki's image however a power-sharing agreement that was brokered by a number of dignitaries, both locally and internationally, led to the end of violence that claimed over 1,000 lives, displacement of more than 300,000 Kenyans, and damage of millions of worth of properties. Also, he never succeeded in fighting against corruption that was prevalent in his two-terms presidency that had crippled Kenyan's economy during Moi's rule. The general sentiments among Kenyans concerning the death of their third president is that Kibaki was the best president Kenya has ever had. They question whether they'll ever have a president equal to or who will surpass Kibaki's legacy. Kibaki met Lucy Muthoni in 1959. When they met, Lucy was holding the position of principal at Kambui College, Kiambu. Lucy was born in 1936 to John Kagai, a pastor, and Rose Nyachomba, in Mukurwr-ini, Nyeri County. Lucy was trained as a teacher - having worked in that capacity at Kamwenja Teacher's College, and later at Kambui College before she was promoted to the post of principal at the college. After two years of dating, they married in 1961. Two years later, Lucy resigned from her teaching job. Lucy died at the age of 80 on April 26, 2016, at Bupa Cromwell Hospital in London after having been briefly hospitalised at Nairobi Hospital for chest pains. Uhuru Kenyatta didn't disclose the cause of Kibaki's death when he broke the news in a televised address to the nation. However, on Monday (April 25) when the doors were opened for the public to view Kibaki's body culminating in a state funeral on Friday (April 29) before being buried at his rural home (April 30), Jimmy in an interview with Citizen TV stated his father had been ailing for three years. His condition had worsened three months prior to his death. The former president died at Nairobi Hospital where he was hospitalised. The two have left behind four children - Judy Wanjiku, Jimmy Kibaki, David Kagai and Tony Gîthînji - grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

13,Demographic Decline: An Inevitable Feature of Industrial Society?,politics," Max Roser  It seems absurd, in a world which is closing in on 8 billion people, to speculate about underpopulation and humanity’s population vitality. But this staggeringly large number conceals its hidden figures, specifically that among the developed, rich nations of the world, only one - Israel - has a fertility rate which is above replacement levels. Fully ⅓ of the countries of the world, some 60 of them, have fertility rates which are below replacement low. Some have shockingly low ones, like South Korea, which has a TFR close to barely 1, meaning that within a generation its population will nearly half. The number of aged and retired will grow dramatically across the world, relative to the working population. These problems, and although there are positives to them they can only be considered as problems in light of the severe dislocation that population decline will bring, have been spoken of for a while, but so far there have been no real long-term solutions in most countries. The question is whether there is an inherent feature to industrial civilization which makes it incompatible with stable populations. The question at heart, is why. The first step is comparing the current system to that which preceded it. Pre-industrial civilization experienced major population fluctuations, but generally it only declined in the context of agricultural disaster, war, or disease. For the population to decline in peace, outside of these crises, would have been most unusual indeed: periods of population decline are referred to as crises, such as the Crisis of the 17th Century when the European population as a whole declined. At the same time, the population was dramatically lower, so a direct comparison is perhaps less than applicable. After all, the current population in industrialized countries has massively exceeded its carrying capacity and massively exceeded the population levels of pre-industrial society. Even in societies with major expected population declines, such as Japan, the most pessimistic projections still foresee the population as substantially over 40 million in a century’s time - substantially more than the pre-industrial population of circa 30 million. Thus even population declines will take a long time to see the population dwindle below what represented the peak of pre-industrial populations, and Japan is an extreme case. While there is a stereotype that pre-modern populations were unable to control their fertility, mechanisms did exist for this, simply not in the liberal, autonomous individual sense that we assume today. For example, in the 17th century, the climate crisis and state breakdown and war, most particularly prevalent in the 1620-1660 period, led to a decline in population fertility. Couples married later, some never married at all, and since, despite a rise in illegitimate births, the great majority of children continued to be born in marriage, this led to a fall in the birth rate. Most tragically from the modern perspective, infanticide rates skyrocketed, and de-facto infanticide via depositing children in convents, where the overwhelming majority died, also soared. Furthermore, large numbers of women were secluded away in nunneries. Pre-modern society might not have been easily able to deal with contraception like today, and lacked access to safe and legal abortion, but it did have its own forms of population control. This is important since it means that population growth was, contrary to our assumption of an inability to control fertility, controlled by society. This has its own corollary however: it meant that people were willing to have children in large numbers, despite inferior living conditions compared to today. They were not automatons, and not forced: there were options available such as infanticide, convents, and avoiding marriage existed. Conscious decisions were made to have a growing population, despite the hard conditions and poverty. A principal impediment to having children today is the cost, but a far less rich time, with far less material prosperity to support children, had them. This all comes however, with an asterisk. While the population may have grown, it was divided into two broad groupings: the cities and the countryside. The latter did have a growing population, while the population of the former was only kept stable through constant immigrant from the rural areas, since the higher death rates of the cities meant that they represented a zone of death, where mortality exceeded births. But since cities were proportionally a small proportion of the total population, their negative demographic effect could be contained. This regime was predicated on high birth and death rates. Contrary to general beliefs, death did not come at 30 like the stereotype! Rather, if one survived childhood, one had a good chance of reaching a respectable old age - 50 for example, was considered a decent standard in Japan. But surviving childhood was hard, since over half of all children died before they were 5. To ensure population stability, 5 or more children - actually substantially more, since there were large percentages of the population which would never marry and have children - were required per married couple for the population to keep stable. The transition to a modern regime - a low fertility and low death rate, was marked by what is called the “demographic transition.” The death rate dropped first, while the birth rate took longer to adjust culturally, resulting in a population boom in standard examples. There are exceptions of course, such as France, whose demographic transition came earlier for births and which resulted in a stagnant population. But it held true as a whole, and the exceptions since, such as the 50s and 60s baby booms, have proved fleeting and eventually a return to the regular trends have occurred. Implicitly, this has implied population stability in most of the charts used about it - but the new equilibrium is defined by population decline in most countries. Is this natural? Perhaps, since it could be a return to a previous equilibrium. Japan is predicted to decline to 40 million at the end of the century - which is just slightly above its pre-modern level, and Japan is one of the most extreme examples. Perhaps the population will simply adjust. There's some cases which seem to show this - France and Ireland were the European countries with the greatest population decline or stagnation in the 19th century, and yet today are the European countries with the greatest population growth. Perhaps they show that populations move in waves over the course of time, and that they grow and decline in cycles. There is nothing to confirm that this will occur: perhaps the population will continue to dwindle forever, or perhaps just like with agricultural civilization, some sort of general population equilibrium will be achieved. As noted above, population growth was controllable even in a pre-modern context, the equilibrium was a feature of population stresses: when these were removed, when plagues, famines, war, etc. abated, the population expanded. The carrying capacity of the land was of course related, but just like today human activity could dramatically change this carrying capacity. The question to ask then, is what the constraining factors are on modern incentives for population expansion. These are: 1)Cost of having children, in regards to food, housing, schooling, healthcare, education, etc. These are massive compared to anything which existed in the pre-modern era, and the cost of a child easily reaches into the hundreds of thousands and for the more well off, the millions. 2)Opportunity cost. There are multiple sides to this. one can see this most clearly discussed in the way that people talk of “childfree” lifestyles - without children, one has much more disposable income, greater freedom for adult enjoyments, less responsibilities. A key difference between modern population planning and the older one is that there is far greater ability to plan within a relationship, with contraception and legal, safe, effectively unlimited abortion. While a couple could have gone without children, it would have been far more fraught with risks, inconveniences, emotional burden, and danger in the pre-modern period. Most importantly of course, families do not have anywhere close to the social pressure to have children anymore. Low marriage rages via large populations in domestic service served to control population growth in pre-modern European society, while now planning within the family unit achieves the same. 3)Children utility. There really isn't much of a benefit to having children in modern societies other than in purely emotional terms. In pre-modern agricultural societies, children were useful for their labor, since they could do various domestic tasks and farm labor and mature relatively quickly. Furthermore they would have been the singular source of retirement security in old age, in an era without pensions or social assistance. By contrast, child labor is not acceptable today and so children don't give any direct economic utility, household farm labor is a small percentage of the population, and retirement is no longer provided by children but rather by social security and government assistance. 4)Changing fertility trends. This perhaps isn't inherent to industrial society, since marriage rates and age of childbirth actually became younger for a period, but it seems integral to a highly educated, college oriented society: inherently extensive non-earning periods, spent in education, reduce substantially the period available to young people to have children. If a college degree holder is say, 25 years old, and assuming that it takes them a few years to settle down, become financially stable, and be ready to have kids, then inherently the potential age of child giving has been cut into, at least for women. On the other hand, there have been an increasing number of older women giving birth. A good example of counterbalancing to industrial society is the growth of non-industrial groups like the Amish or Ultraorthodox Jews. None of these factors are ones which seem likely to change, in that although the costs of children might become less relatively, there will continue to be few benefits to having them. Declining and stagnant populations are an inherent feature of industrial civilization from what we know, and only a paradigm shift can change this. The only counter-examples stem from making up for periods of reduced growth, such as the baby booms following the losses of the First and Second World Wars and the stagnation in the middle, or periods of prolonged population stagnation such as France and Ireland. On a more dramatic scale, the same might be said to exist for Israel, which although in part driven by the ultra-Orthodox's birthrate, has a high birthrate which is in part explained due to collective psychosis about the disasters which have befallen the Jewish people in the 20th century. Eventually, populations stop growing after their demographic transition and will start to shrink, and this shrinking is inevitable. There has been much talked about concerning what sort of problems and benefits there are to declining populations, to the extent that it isn't really necessary to say anything about it. What's more interesting is how long they might last. Specifically, is there any reason to think that eventually this population decline might bottom out? While we don't have any obvious historical testaments, I think that the examples of Ireland, France, and Israel all show that industrialized societies can undergo a correction to make up for previous population shortfalls. Furthermore, there is also a selection bias present within populations. We probably won't all be Amish in 2100, but groups like the Amish which better resist the tendency of the modern age to isolation, social atomization, and individualism will grow as a percentage of the population, and without social pressure functioning as the primary reason for having children, individual selection will take place - people with a drive to have children will steadily become more and more prominent. Cat moms and childfree people simply do not pass on their genes. Eventually, the population will decline and stabilize at some lower level. To answer the question of whether demographic decline is an inevitable part of industrial society, the response is quite clearly yes. Industrial society inherently promotes population stagnation and decline after the initial spurt. At the same time, nature abhors a vacuum: over the long run, factors will produce a corresponding stabilization of the population. And in the very long run, future technological factors like artificial wombs, cloning, and perhaps life prolonging will make the entire question irrelevant. Industrial society's population base will more or less gradually (depending on which country you are in) shrink, reaching some point of relative stability after a century or two, and then will rise on the introduction of new technologies and weeding out of people who aren't predisposed to have children. The main question concerning population stagnation will not be the death of the human race, but rather the political ramifications of flows of people and population shifts occasioned by population changes. This is a far more serious question, and I have my doubts about the ability of the developed countries of the world to absorb and assimilate large numbers of immigrants from the developing countries. But it is also one which is much more a reflection of the reality that pronatalism is less about a fear of insufficient numbers of humans, and more what type of humans. Most demographic predictions are worthless a century into the future. The truth is it is impossible to know what will happen, and routinely we are flummoxed by actual societal demographic developments. But it seems that there are some good examples to show that there is a stabilizing factor present in populations and that just as the Population Bomb proved wrong, so too will the idea of the voluntary extinction of the human race.

14,"Politics, Pistols, and Predestination",politics," Caston George is a 10-year veteran political professional and former politician, accomplished writer, researcher, author, and archivist. When two factors, equal in value, act in opposition, it indicates polarised stability: whether it be positive and negative, active and passive, democrat and republican, top and bottom, fixed and volatile, transmission and reception, peanut butter and jelly. Together, they may produce a variety of results, each of which will be pulled to one pole or the other, to greater or lesser degrees, creating different points on the monolinear spectra and expanding it, giving it multidimensional qualities. When two polarities synthesize a product amongst themselves due to their action upon one another, that creates the most basic of primary factors. Yet each product will, by nature, also result in the production of its opposite. For instance, the right-polarised Bush presidency resulted in the production the left-polarised Obama presidency, and the existence thereof resulted in the production of its, opposite, the Trump presidency, which is itself a synthesised product resultant of the action of the Republican Party and the mistakenly named 'tea party’, upon and with one another -- just as they themselves produced their polarised opposites, in Occupy/$15/Berniecrats, etc. From universal elements to atomic basics, to sociality, to the formation of stars, this law would seem to be true. A polarity results in a tripolarity, which by nature prompts the production of its opposite, giving a quadripolarity. New experiment, a factor from one pole, repolarises to the opposite pole, receiving the charges and qualities of both, along with each prime point, and the resultant products, and the various virtues, principles, etcetera, thereof; and comes to stand, perfectly balanced, alone, at centrepoint in the quarternarial spectra. Or, instead of around a circle, it instead chooses to go ""up"", and thusly ascending to a new plane, and pioneering itself and the whole into an as yet uncharted new dimension. Either this factor will choose one pole over another, given the potentiated qualities possessed by this factor, resulting in an imbalance and the natural correction of that imbalance, and further/escalated perpetuation, like with guns in the US, generating its opposite, which causes a product -- gun debates and hearings -- that, inevitably, due to shortsighted ""Constitutional"" (the document, not the actual definition of the term constitution) rules via the 'second amendment' made ""permanent"" (until the constituents of this Constitution choose to self-determine and not follow those rules anymore) always default to an imbalanced supremacy of the pro-gun side, which results in cyclical perpetuation, and the escalation of gun violence; wash rinse repeat, over and over again, building with each cycle and escalating in intensity, with each turn of that particular wheel. Thus my hypothesis would seem to be proven correct. Which sadly means that I can predict with some certainty that as long as the Second Amendment exists, people will continue to die, this cycle will continue, until the intensity gets so high after so many turns of the wheel and cyclical perpetuation that... Well... And you can take this any number of ways, until all resources are expended, and the cycle cannot continue due to either faction not being able to produce anything new amongst themselves. The stagnation of progress, and the inability to compromise, in this instance, with any result that would have meat, weight, or teeth to it, will mean that the increasing intensity of each cycle will burn out all resources, until the factors themselves are extinct. In other words, this impasse will perpetuate this endless loop until the people are all dead. And on a personal note, I ask you what good is a constitutional Second Amendment if there's no one around left to follow it? ... Or if it produces a country you don’t want to live in anymore, cannot leave, and due the nature of its provisions and rules cannot feasibly, practically change... But I digress, as that is the topic of a very different hypothesis of mine and will have a very different result! Best broached in another post. Getting back to our centrepoint of our quadripolarity, what if, and just think for yourself ( ( Getting back to our centrepoint of our quadripolarity, what if, and just think for yourself  upon this for a moment and the implications of this prospect. Instead of inevitable doom it could do something new, choose its own unique destiny for itself, and perhaps, for the whole. By accepting the definitions of the other four poles and their products, it falls under one of their respective domains, and as they would then define it for itself, those definitions are, by literal definition , boundaries and limitations, such as is the case in the instance of the example, the second amendment. But if that centrepoint, so empowered and balanced, did in fact choose to throw out the definition it was determined to have by the four factions and the binary poles they fall under, it then creates its own definition for itself, and self-definition is self-determination. That is to say, it can choose to ascend upward, as previously indicated, which would add a dimension above the previous four, just as the four points of a single-plane figure such as the square rise upward to a single-pointed focus at the apex of a pyramid, instead of yet another loop around the circle. In case of guns, in order for any meaningful change to occur, we must leave the second amendment, as currently defined, out of consideration: it only defines the parametres of the debate — and thusly confines and limits the options available the gun crisis — to only those measures past which are all under the supremacy of the black and white parent polarity, with the quadripolarity only the various shades of grey that fall in betwixt the two. Those options are all weighted in favour of the restrictor and it’s pole, i.e., the second amendment and it’s guns, their opportunistic manufacturers, fanatical owners, and their zealous admirers — rather than the liberator, and its own pole: the side of, at its extreme, total disarmament, with its grey shading falling between loosely affiliated positions ranging from assault weapons band and magazine restrictions to ammunition taxes, which have no chance at overcoming their polar opposite, due to the second amendment and the ‘apparati systemica americana’, even if 60% percent of the public were behind such an effort, without extraordinary measures. If those boundaries of the second amendment cannot be changed, then they must be — willfully — ignored. If that centrepoint remains self-determined, however, and not choosing one pole or one duality over the other, and instead decides to do something of its own accord, election, and volition, do you know what that makes? A new faction; that is to say, a new and variable element. Whereas it/they/she/he would have been, by picking a side, kingmaker to one of the various poles and the larger binary, perpetuating the cycle either into eternal balance or into stagnant extinction, he becomes a king in his own right, and therefore constitutes an empowered faction, or kingdom, in and unto himself and his sphere of existence and influence. You can apply this principle to the gun debate, to party politics, to interpersonal relationships, to workplace interrelations, etc. Once that change manifests and the old limitations of the past discarded or evolved beyond, it is not to be undone thereafter (not easily, anyway), and represents a permanent alteration and shift in consciousness, as it signifies true self-awareness through self-determination, and it means that our quadripolarity chart either changes shape dramatically, such as a square or equilateral cross becomes a pentagon or pentagram by recognizing the point synthesized from the previous four points of the quadrilateral, or shall, in the case of the boundaries restricting dramatic shape changing due to the 'systemica americana’, have nowhere else to go but upward instead of outward, into that higher plane, as with the pyramid, and be either: A) The fifth faction, equal in value and power to the other factors of the former quarternarial (now quinary) factionaries or; B) their superior, that is to say, the fifth faction and director/leader/regulator thereof the other four. Which one shall He/it/they be? No way to predict, as the fifth faction self-determines, remember? You could ask that faction (which reminds me, share your comments this post, or questions, below! ) Though, if that fifth faction were ME, I would say, ""I will both do and be what I will, and what I will will both do, and be."" And I'd be sassy and hashtag it with #LongLiveTheKing and #LongMayIReignWhadddaaaapp! cause, you know, I'm cute and stuff.

15,COVID-19: History’s Fast Forward Button,politics," Author, poet, attorney and photographer. 

Former collegiate football player. Graduated summa cum laude, Phil Beta Kappa. A while ago, I got bored and decided to stream Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. I recall not being thrilled with it when I first saw the film in theaters. But after re-watching it, I came to the realization that it was actually worse than I remembered. However, one scene got me thinking. It’s when John Connor, now a vagrant adult, first meets Arnold. Shocked at encountering the machine, John asks him why is he here since, after the events of Terminator 2, “Judgement Day” should have been averted. Arnold responds by saying that Judgement Day had not been averted, only delayed. It was, as he put it, “inevitable.” History is complicated. It’s an unforgiving and chaotic process—one that is affected and determined by a variety of variables, many of which are often unknown or completely outside the control of the actors that shape them. It’s the reason why it is so difficult to predict future events, as the trends and momentum of the moment can quickly and cataclysmically shift at a moment’s juncture. This is also convoluted by the fact that it’s difficult for one to take a step back and observe the current moment from an objective vantage point. We are all emotional creatures, affected by our surroundings, circumstances, and people around us. This makes shedding away one’s biases and preconceived notions about our reality a problematic feat, even for the most intelligent among us. The start of 2020 was the beginning of what promised to be a very tumultuous decade. From the Pandemic, to economic and fiscal collapse, social unrest, and great power competition, I think it’s safe to say that many of our outlooks on the short term future are pessimistic. It’s easy to blame individuals for this unfortunate state of affairs, whether it be Obama, Trump, Putin, global elites, etc.. And sure, perhaps they deserve some blame. No doubt the Pandemic, along with its myriad of ancillary consequences, is viewed as one of, if not the most, essential component in bringing about these hardships. However, this is where my historical perspective comes into play. I’m sure you, the reader, like I, have imagined an alternative reality in which COVID-19 never emerged. What would be different? How would I be different, etc.? It wouldn’t surprise me if we, at some point over the next few years, saw numerous works of alternative history being published depicting a world devoid of a viral outbreak. For me, I don’t know for sure how our reality would differ if COVID didn’t exist. Alternative history is, in many ways, is more challenging than prophesizing. Nevertheless, I’ve developed a theory—one which I’ve given careful consideration. COVID did not create our current chaotic state of affairs. On the contrary, many of the events we’ve seen and circumstances we’re currently facing would have most likely occurred even without COVID. All the Pandemic did was merely speed things up. In other words, COVID functioned primarily as a fast forward button. Please note that I’m not trying to argue that COVID did not have externalities. As I write this, millions the world over have perished because of the virus. Moreover, it has certainly had a negative psychological impact on many of us. What I’m contending is that much of what we’ve witnessed and are witnessing was probably, at least in some form or another, inevitable. I will argue this point by examining various aspects of our modern day society, political systems, and economics. The Rise and Fall of the Technocracy In February of 2020, just before the infamous March shutdown, George Friedman released his newest book, The Storm Before the Calm: America's Discord, the Coming Crisis of the 2020s, and the Triumph Beyond. In it, Friedman attempts to predict what he believes will be a turbulent decade to come. His thesis rests upon his theory that the United States transitions through two historical cycles: an “institutional cycle” occurring every eighty years and a socio-economic ones transpiring every fifty years. Friedman contends that for the first time in American history, the two cycles will converge, both occurring within the 2020 decade. I read his work last summer and what fascinated me most was his discussion of the country’s institutional transformation. Since the Great Depression, there’s been a fundamental shift within the United States federal government. This is the rise of the administrative state. This arguably began during the Wilson Administration, as numerous departments sprang up overnight during America’s entry into WWI. However, it was FDR who entrenched it as a permanent aspect of U.S. governance. Since then, the administrative apparatus has only ballooned in size and scope, becoming more powerful with each successive administration, and having greater influence over individual American’s lives. Friedman refers to the people within these agencies as being part of a “technocracy,” aka rule by experts. These are unelected officials who receive high compensation and long tenures and have acquired significant authority and influence. Moreover, they are rarely fired—immune from being voted out like elected politicians. Though they’re knowledgeable within their fields, they have little to no expertise outside of their purviews. This means that their broader view of what should be considered a broad and coherent policy are often stymied due to their one-dimensional focus. For instance, a public health expert’s focus is narrowly tailored towards health policy, and thus will recommend polices that are often not tailored to take economic, fiscal, and educational facets into consideration. Congress’s perpetual delegation to many of these non-representative institutions and often subsequent failure to hold them accountable has only increased their authority. It’s almost certainly why the U.S. Supreme Court nominee process has become so vitriolic, since the composition of the Court is now often the sole means in which dictates of technocracy are either allowed or struck down. Yet, even the courts are sometimes reluctant to intervene. Under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., which is still a good law, administrative agencies are granted deference to their own interpretation of a statute it administers. Thus, essentially, a fourth branch of government formed during the 20th Century—a massive bureaucratic apparatus which is legally under the executive, largely functions at the behest of its own whims, making law independent of federal legislature. As Friedman mentioned, the coming institutional shift would occur because these agencies have become unworkable. Indeed, over the years, these bureaus have become politicized, which is worrying since they have almost no accountability to the public. Moreover, these agencies continue to swell, as more and more people from top rated universities take their place within these institutions, entrenching their worldviews within these departments and further swelling the federal budget. Hence, we are witnessing several phenomena. First, is the politicization and overreach of unelected federal agencies over time into almost every aspect of American life. Second, there is the adoption of a certain ideology within these institutions that’s radical and in-conflict with American ideals. Third, is organizational incompetence. Fourth, and largely as a result of the first three, there now exists an institutional mistrust by large swathes of the populace. Furthermore, all of these aspects were perpetuated and intensified by the COVID outbreak. Let us begin with our focus on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It’s not surprising that the CDC, along with the rest of the public health establishment, would become a prominent fixture during a pandemic. The problem is they did a sub-par job, thus completely delegitimizing themselves in the process. Let’s start with the fact that the CDC ran roughshod over what was their original prerogative—to protect the public health. It’s thus unsurprising that the CDC would become of principle importance during a pandemic. However, during this health crisis, the CDC, as well as other local and state agencies, expanded its authority to almost every rubric of public life. For instance, the CDC issued a nationwide eviction moratorium in order to prevent persons who were possibly not working or earning income during last year’s health crisis from being evicted from their rental properties. Now, in principle, this may seem like the correct thing. After all, no one should want to see millions of Americans thrown out into the streets. Nevertheless, the CDC is a public health agency, not a federal housing department. Why a public health department would have this power is beyond me. Moreover, is the fact that the CDC, along with many politicians and other health officials for that matter, later went as far as to add guns and racism to the list public health crises. One neither has to like guns nor racism to realize that both are not contagious diseases. In other words, not only are these issues outside the CDC’s parameters, but they are subjects that fall way beyond the expertise of even the most highly trained health specialists. In addition, it did not benefit the public trust when numerous health officials, who previously had demanded that Americans stay home to save lives, did a complete one-eighty days later by overtly or tacitly supporting millions of Americans protesting for racial justice (I will speak more about this in another section). One letter signed by over a 1,000 health professionals during the 2020 summer protests and riots summed up this paradoxical mode of thinking quite well— “…as public health advocates, we do not condemn these [racial justice] gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission. We support them as vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of Black people in the United States. We can show that support by facilitating safest protesting practices without detracting from demonstrators' ability to gather and demand change. This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly protests against stay-home orders.” Furthermore, the CDC appears to have become increasingly politicized, a fact that has not done its public image any favors. For instance, earlier this year, the CDC had put together a school reopening plan. The idea to reopen schools was something that even Dr. Anthony Fauci at that time supported. Indeed, many European nations had kept their schools open, particularly at the elementary level, since these younger children were not the main vectors of transmission. Nonetheless, the CDC’s plan made it so that the vast majority of schools would not reopen. It was then revealed in May that CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, along with her top advisors, were coordinating with the American Federation of Teachers (ATF). This was why the school-opening standards had been so stringent—not because of what the science said, but due to ATF lobbying. Moreover, in the midst of wringing this, it came out that the CDC’s recommendation that kids in school from the age of two up mask was based on a completely bogus study. The question of whether or not kids should mask in school has been a contentious one considering children have not been the primary spreaders of COVID and its effects are generally mild in young kids. There are issues of how mask affect socialization in children’s developing brains and breathing during activities, ect. In fact, the United States is one of the few developed nations in the world that masks kids. This was determined on the conclusions of a single study, one that David Zweig from The Atlantic recently exposed as being completely bogus. I won’t go into the study’s methodology here (you can just Google the article if you’re interested), but it had obvious flaws, which is rather disconcerting considering the its conclusions impacted the lives of millions of American school children. Probably the biggest story that demonstrates the decline in public trust for health officials is the CDC original vaccine rollout plan. As has been the case for a while now, numerous federal governmental institutions have been bombarded with racial and social equity training—“educational” programs designed by such figures as Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo. I will delve deeper into ideology later. However, the important take away is the CDC originally planned to tranche out the vaccine based on considerations of racial equity. The plan called for states to prioritize Black, Hispanic, and Ingenious residents in some way over white populations. Because of this ordering, the CDC recommended that “essential workers” receive the vaccine before the elderly, as the former population is significantly minority-based while the latter is predominantly white. The problem is, other than the fact that a federal agency was basing these standards primarily on race, which is illegal, is that even by the CDC’s own estimates, this would lead to more people dying. This is because older people are much more vulnerable to the adverse effects of COVID than younger, healthier, essential workers. Moreover, it would have ironically led to the deaths of more minorities, since if you used the CDC’s own figures, minority elders would have perished in higher degrees, as well. In other words, the CDC would have sacrificed our country’s most vulnerable all in the name of wokeness and social justice doctrine. This led to an obvious public outcry, forcing the CDC to revise its standards. However, the damage to our nation’s premier health agency was already done. Yascha Mounk expressed this dissatisfaction in his article, Why I'm Losing Trust in the Institutions: The CDC came scarily close to adopting a plan that would, according to its own models, have killed thousands of Americans. He noted that the same agency that was demanding people follow the “science,” allowed social justice ideology to trump science, in regards to whom should be first in line to receive the jab. The decline in the CDC’s reputation was not benefited by the incompetent health establishments’ other mainstays, particularly Dr. Fauci, who in many ways became the unofficial face of battling COVID. Not only did he lie, by his own admission, about mask usefulness and what was necessary for herd immunity, but frequently switched his position on a regular basis, despite there being no significant change in data. Fauci went so far as to say that questioning him was questioning the science, as if he were Emperor Palpatine screeching, “I am the Senate!” Moreover, he almost certainly committed perjury (though not charged yet) by lying to Congress about his role in providing funds to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for gain-of-function research. In addition, his demand that fully vaccinated persons continue to wear masks did not make sense and thus had the unfortunate effect of downplaying the efficacy of vaccines. I want to make clear that I’m not trying to parrot an angry Fox News host here. However, Fauci’s performance during this pandemic has been less than stellar, further delegitimizing the U. S. public health establishment. The administrative apparatus has grown significantly in size and strength during the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries. Nevertheless, as the technocracy has gained more influence, the American public has viewed them with increasing distrust. This is because the technocracy functions as an unelected, bureaucratic, elite that is increasingly out of touch with mainstream America. The current distrust of these imbedded technocrats was almost certainly going to occur at some point. However, the pandemic significantly sped up this process, as the health establishment continually shot itself in the foot. Going forward, this mistrust will probably only gain steam. For instance, the IRS’s request that Congress double its size and give it power to essentially spy on Americans if their transactions or accounts are over $600. More significantly, President Biden’s plan to utilize OSHA to force Americans to be vaccinated through their companies has already received extreme backlash for various reasons, but most especially since it dramatically increases administrative authority over their private lives. Under its wording, the regulation will impose draconian fines, bankrupting businesses that refuse to supply. Despite this, the rollout is currently underway. George Friedman’s astute predictions mentioned earlier certainly appear to be underway, though likely at a quicker pace than even he suspected. Thucydides Trap: The United States vs. China In Thucydides History of the Peloponnesian War, he proposes that war between Sparta and Athens occurred for one simple reason—Sparta, Greece’s most powerful city-state, feared the rise of Athens. Centuries after its penning, Thucydides thesis has consistently been tested. A emerging power, as it expands in influence, begins to butt heads with an established power, the latter dreading that the former may surpass it. These situations lead to increased tensions, which more often than not, cumulate into full-scale war. There is even a term for this, doubly called “Thucydides Trap”, the notion being that kingdoms, empires and nations are unable to escape this unfortunate reality. Graham Allison, although not the first person to discuss this phenomenon, was the first to use the phrase Thucydides Trap, which he utilized as the catch-phrase for his 2017 book Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap? In it, Allison details that in the last 500 years, a situation in which a rising power challenged a predominant state occurred sixteen times. War broke out during twelve of these occasions. Allison uses this model to analyze what he sees as a coming exacerbation of tensions between the United States and China. Predictions that the United States would enter a new Cold War with China have existed since the Soviet Union’s abrupt collapse. Political scientist and author of the book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, John Mearsheimer, foresaw this in the early 90’s, as China possessed the population and economic wherewithal to challenge the world’s unipolar power. In a recent article for Foreign Affairs Magazine, The Inevitable Rivalry: America, China, and the Tragedy of Great-Power Politics, Mearsheimer contends that, following the end of the Cold War, it should have been suspected that, Since a mightier China would surely challenge the U.S. position in Asia and possibly beyond, the logical choice for the United States was clear: slow China’s rise…Instead, it encouraged it. Beguiled by misguided theories about liberalism’s inevitable triumph and the obsolescence of great-power conflict, both Democratic and Republican administrations pursued a policy of engagement, which sought to help China grow richer. Such policies included China’s admission to the World Trade Organization and the United States increasing outsourcing to the Communist nation. The idea from some U.S. policy makers is that such an engagement would open China up, make is less repressive, and a stakeholder in the current, liberal, international order. The problem is that it made the CCP economically powerful, allowing it to invest more in its military operations. Moreover, China has grown more, not less, repressive. As Mearsheimer noted, But once China grew wealthy, a U.S.-Chinese Cold War was inevitable. Engagement may have been the worst strategic blunder any country has made in recent history: there is no comparable example of a great power actively fostering the rise of a peer competitor. President Obama did begin a slight pushback against Beijing, but it was not until the Trump Administration that engagement with the Asian power was discarded for a more aggressive posture. What’s interesting is with Trump out of office, one might suspect that the Biden Administration would move back to a more conciliatory position. However, Biden’s policy essentially mirrors Trump’s, as the current president is overtly building alliances in the Indo-Pacific region that are clearly aimed at containing a rising China. Now, with the start of the new decade, China has begun to assert itself in East Asia like no other time since its regional primacy during the early part the 19th century. The CCP’s hostile rhetoric, along with increasingly aggressive actions towards its neighbors, prove that the Asian juggernaut has renewed itself as a great power and potential superpower. Similar to how the up-and-coming United States attempted (and eventually did) dominate the Western Hemisphere during the later 19th and early 20 centuries, China is attempting to establish hegemony in its region. And at this moment, Beijing’s only real obstacle is the current reigning, established power—the United States. However, the question becomes, “How did the Pandemic intensify and accelerate what was almost certainly an inevitable conflict?” Perhaps the best place to start would be the election of Donald Trump. Trump differed from his predecessors as he took a much more aggressive tone with the CCP. This was particularly true with regards to trade, as he believed the Chinese were economically taking advantage of the United States. It should be noted that, prior to Trump, American politicians often did speak about the threat of a rising China. However, as Mearsheimer noted earlier, the top American political brass was often much more conciliatory. Trump, though not completely disinterested with the idea of engagement, certainly took a more belligerent posture. What really set things into high gear, however, was the emergence of COVID. First, was the blame game that emerged between the two powers. It has not, as of yet, been confirmed that COVID emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Nonetheless, even if it didn’t, it’s clear that the CCP’s malfeasance allowed it to spread. The Chinese government’s censorship of doctors trying to come forward, along with their later claims to the World Health Organization that the virus was not passed via human-to-human transmission, are just a few examples of its failure to shut down the virus earlier and perhaps prevent the subsequent pandemic. This increased obvious tension with the United States, especially after many of its officials began implying that the virus perhaps had only been made in the U.S., and was released purposefully by the Americans. A Chinese official named Zhao Lijian even tweeted, ""It might be U.S. army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan…Be transparent! Make public your data! U.S. owes us an explanation!"" This caused the Trump reaction of branding COVID with its now infamous nickname the “China Virus.” As global pressure came down upon Beijing, the CCP responded with more aggressive behavior. With the docking of the U. S. S. Theodore Roosevelt, due to a ship-wide outbreak, the People’s Liberation Army Navy pushed its advantage in the South China Sea. The United States responded by conducting an “elephant walk” with its bombers on Guam—a relatively impotent response to Chinese maneuvers. With Trump out of office, some may have suspected that relations would “normalize”. However, that hasn’t been the case. Though the Biden Administration is not as verbally hostile, most of Trump’s China policies have remained intact. From Beijing’s perspective, it now feels under siege—surrounded on all front by hostile nations, many of which it has border disputes with and either overtly or tacitly allied with the United States. From its war of words with Australia in the Pacific, to engaging in firefights with Indian troops, China hasn’t been this isolated in decades. This is of little surprise given this state of affairs that Asia’s potential hegemon would lash out against the CCP. Furthermore, it’s increased aggression both rhetorically and kinetically towards Taiwan is another cause for concern, since it’s the most likely flashpoint between itself and the U.S. The question is this—where will it all lead? China is potentially considerably more dangerous than the Soviet Union. Not only does it possess a larger population and a more dynamic economy, but its “openness” to the rest of the world has meant it has been able to influence the politics, economies, and cultures of even its greatest rival. Just think of how often the NBA and Disney kowtow to the CPP. There are some China watchers, like Gordon Chang, who believe China is entering another period of isolation. In other words, Beijing could attempt to purge itself from Western cultural institutions and businesses. However, it’s too early to tell. What is clear is that whatever the future may hold for this Cold War 2.0, there is little doubt that it was accelerated by COVID’s emergence. “Demographics Are Destiny”: The Economic and Cultural Stratification of the United States Unless you had read any of his works, it’s unlikely you ever heard of anthropologist Peter Turchin before 2020. However, Turchin came to considerable prominence for a prediction he made during 2010. Turchin forecasted that 2020 would bring about major social and political upheaval within the United States and Europe. During the 2020 summer riots, this prophecy caught obvious attention, with Turchin now seeming like a modern day Nostradamus. But as Turchin would himself admit, he possesses no psychic abilities. Rather, his forecast was based on a formula, one that take various factors into account and measures them on a graph. Through this blue print, Turchin was able to apply it to societies as diverse as the Roman Republic and Medieval France, predicting when social upheavals should have occurred. These forecasts align almost exactly to the dates that these civilizations experienced unrest in our timeline. Turhcin applied his analysis to the United States in his work Ages of Discord: A Structural-Demographic Analysis of American History. His thesis is complicated, but I’ll summarize here. Essentially, Turhcin contends that societies go through cycles. There is a cycle of stability, which leads to economic and population growth. The problem is that eventually the population reaches a point at which the value of labor goes down, since there is an overabundance of workers in the market. This leads this to stagnated wages for working people. In the meantime, the upper classes grow in size because people with capital can invest more, which creates more inequality between labor and capital. This split between the two socio-economic factions leads to increased pressure to get into the elite class. And with this now large upper class, a factional split between this elite occurs, such as the divide between Optimates and Populares during the late Roman Republic. Usually, these situations rectify themselves due to some sort of demographic rebalancing, aka population decline due to war or disease. For instance, consider how after the Great Plague, the quality of peasants’ lives increased substantially since, because there were so few of them, it gave the lower classes substantially more bargaining against their lords—leverage they utilized to achieve more favorable working conditions. The United States has been going through one of these cycles since the 1970’s, when incomes began to stagnate. From the 1950’s on, America experienced an extraordinary population boom, leading to an increased workforce around the late 60’s and 70’s. This was coupled with the addition of other groups to the market, such as women and immigrants, thus adding an even more significant influx to the labor force. I want to add that I’m not trying take an anti-immigration stand here or argue that women should “go back to the kitchen.” I’m just pointing out the reality of what happens when the workforce swells. It’s the reason why two-income households today often have lower standards of living than one-income households just a few decades ago. Real wage stagnation was coupled with the issues posed by increased globalization. Globalization and free trade are not necessarily bad things. In fact, it’s the reason why so many of our consumer goods are so cheap today. However, jobs moving overseas meant less working opportunities for an already oversaturated working class. Simultaneously, the number of millionaires almost quadrupled during the decades following 1980s. As the working class living standards stagnated and opportunities for a growing upper echelon increased, there came an intense competition to get into the elite class. This is partially why college tuitions have surged by ridiculous degrees. For as more people struggled to enter this elite, universities could charge absorbent prices for that prospect. Furthermore, the increase of the percentage of the populace who attend college translates to a lower value in a university degree, since it’s no longer seen as that exclusive of a credential. The same is also true of post-graduate degrees. However, the growing societal bifurcation was not just economic, but also cultural. This was particularly true within White America. Charles A. Murray writes about this in his work Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960-2010. In it, Murray discusses that beginning around the point of JFK’s presidency, there began to form a split between blue collar America and what he dubbed the “new ruling class.” This new elite harbored much more socially progressive views than their counterparts. Moreover, they grew to control almost all facets of creative output. Though this new upper class views itself as liberal, they often don’t necessary practice what they preach. A good example is what is often described as the “limousine liberals”—the stereotypical, college educated, wealthy New York or San Francisco residents who drive Teslas and preach woke causes, almost as a means of gaining status with virtue to their friends, family, and neighbors. Of course, these categorizations aren’t perfect, as not every rich person who resides in a progressive metropolis espouses socialist talking points or takes pictures with the Black Panthers like they’re Leonard Bernstein. Nevertheless, a cultural divergence has undoubtedly occurred. For instance, take entertainment. Many of the films that receive Oscars are ones that champion some sort of progressive message. Not all these movies are universally hated. However, one only need to compare the Rotten Tomatoes critic’s score to the viewer’s score to discover that many of the movies that the critics relish are not widely enjoyed by the public, and vice-versa. Thus, this economic and cultural divide was already well under way before 2020. The question is, how did the Pandemic accelerate this process? Economically, the Pandemic hastened arguably the most significant wealth transfer in American history. This was the result primarily of lockdown policies, which were mostly governments’ initial responses to COVID-19. While millions of small businesses were forced to shut down, massive companies, often lucky enough to be labeled “essential industries,” were allowed to stay open. This meant that while small businesses were essentially gutted, the profits of large retailers like Amazon soared. This is what Carol Roth referred to in her article We're Living Through the Greatest Transfer of Wealth From the Middle Class to the Elites in History as the “ ’Great Consolidation’ —the acceleration of a historic wealth transfer and power concentration out of the hands of the middle class and into those with political power and connections.” While state and local governments were releasing criminals without bail in order to prevent the COVID spread within prisons, every day people like Shelley Luther, a Dallas hair salon owner, was arrested by heavily armed sheriffs for nothing more than trying to keep her business afloat. When brought before a judge, Shelley pleaded she did not have the resources to keep her business closed. Incidents like these occurred throughout the Pandemic. Angela Marsden, a restaurant owner, posted a tearful video in which she rightfully complained that while she was forced to close down her restaurant, a movie studio had set up dining tents in the parking lot next door in order to feed cast and crew. This was because the entertainment industry, regularly considered the epitome of elite culture, was allowed to work while Angela was not. LA mayor Eric Garcetti, in a tone-death response that didn’t even address this double-standard and hypocrisy, responded by saying, “heart goes out [to Marsden and her staff]….No one likes these restrictions, but I do support them as our hospital I.C.U. beds fill to capacity and cases have increased by 500%. We must stop this virus before it kills thousands of more Angelenos.” While everyday working Americans suffered, the lucky ones who had the luxury of being able to work from home, particularly media members, jeered at their less fortunate brethren for complaining about the lockdowns. This prompted none other than Fareed Zakaria to publish an opinion piece titled Experts have jobs. They need to understand those who don’t. In it, Zakaria made an argument similar to that of Charles Murrey, that there has been an economic and cultural split between urban, college educated, credentialed professionals (an “overclass”) and the rest of society. He argued that, “For many non-college-educated people, especially those living in rural areas, there is a deep alienation from this new elite. They see the overclass as enacting policies that are presented as good for the whole country but really mostly benefit people from the ruling class, whose lives have gotten better over the past few decades while the rest are left behind.” Zakaria continued by looking at it from the perspective of every-day Americans; “Imagine you are an American who works with his hands — a truck driver, a construction worker, an oil rig mechanic — and you have just lost your job because of the lockdowns, as have more than 36 million people. You turn on the television and hear medical experts, academics, technocrats and journalists explain that we must keep the economy closed — in other words, keep you unemployed — because public health is important. All these people making the case have jobs, have maintained their standards of living and in fact are now in greater demand. They feel as though they are doing important work. You, on the other hand, have lost your job. You feel a sense of worthlessness, and you’re terrified about your family’s day-to-day survival. Is it so hard to understand why people like this might be skeptical of the experts?” This alienation and distrust of experts, media personalities, and government bureaucrats only grew during the summer of 2020, when, as mentioned earlier, public officials did a complete 180, cheering as millions flooded into the streets to protest or riot for social justice. I should also mention that the social unrest, which was primarily an urban phenomenon, absolutely devastated businesses within inner-cities. This was predominantly true in places such as Portland and Seattle, where entire blocks were taken over and ransacked. For instance, Korboi Balla, an African American, Minneapolis fireman, who invested his life savings into a bar, was set to reopen it following the lockdown easements on June 1st. Unfortunately, his business was burned to the ground during the riots, causing him to tearfully tell reporters, “I don’t know what we’re going to do, It hurts, man. It’s not fair, it’s not right. We’ve been working so hard for this place. It’s not just for me, it’s for my family.” Of particular disgust was when media elites, sheltered within their gated, residential houses and compounds, would cheer on this destruction. My personal favorite was former ESPN reporter Chris Palmer retweeted a photo of an inflamed Minneapolis police precinct, as he added the slogan, “Burn that shit down. Burn it all down.” Awhile later, Palmer tweeted, “They just attacked our sister community down the street. It’s a gated community and they tried to climb the gates. They had to beat them back. They destroyed a Starbucks and are now in front of my building. Get these animals TG out of my neighborhood. Go back to where you live.” What also became apparent during the Pandemic was that this elite class, which readily told people to shut up and comply, did not follow their own guidelines. They, in effect, were the “specials.” It would take another couple of paragraphs to list these hypocritical behaviors, but I’ll mention a few here: California Governor Gavin Newsom dining maskless, indoors at one of the state’s most expensive restaurants with several people including a CA public health official; CA health officials taking an impromptu, expenses paid trip to Maui during the height of the Pandemic; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi getting her hair done in San Francisco despite local guidelines against it and then having the audacity to not even apologize because it was a political setup orchestrated by her lowly hair stylist. Notwithstanding, there were the public spectacles that occurred while most of the country was forced to lockdown in their homes. For instance, the funerals of John Lewis and George Floyd, the latter who was placed in a gold casket at a memorial attended by future President Joe Biden, the former with an appearance by Barack Obama. I bring attention to these not because of who the deceased were per se, but because there were numerous Americans who lost loved ones who couldn’t even have services. Yet, the specials were able to perform their services of those they deemed worthy of such honors, COVID restrictions be damned. Another incident worth mentioning occurred during December of 2020, when protests broke out in Staten Island demanding an end to lockdown restrictions. Many of these demonstrators were working class or small business owners, under strain from their inability to work. Pete Davidson, a comedian on Saturday Night Live, a wealthy celebrity who was allowed to keep working, ripped these people during the show’s weekly update report. It should also be mentioned that at that time, SNL was able to have a live audience as they paid attendees to watch as “employees”, essentially gaming or getting around the lockdown regime system. This cultural and class divide became only more apparent in 2021. For instance, as the Delta variant surged, former President Obama put on a luxurious sixtieth birthday party at Martha’s Vineyard, which included scores of elites and celebrities. This wouldn’t have been an issue, except restrictions were being reinstated in many states, and the attendees were generally part of the pro-lockdown crowd. Public outrage did eventually forced Obama to cut back on the number of guests. However, what was the most telling was the leaked video from Erykah Badu, showing her, the President, and other guests dancing maskless at the decadent celebration. Badu was quickly forced to delete the video, but not before it made its rounds around social media to widespread mockery. Media personalities jumped to the former president’s and party goers’ defense, like New York Times reporter Annie Karini, who commented that the party was probably okay since the guests were a “sophisticated, vaccinated crowd.” But such statements only increased the backlash. The Meta Gala later in the year only visually reinforced this divide, as wealthy celebrities and politicians attend the event in elegant garb, while the servants in the background were made to wear masks as they catered to these elites. My personal favorite picture from the event was of Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney sporting a dress that said “Equal Rights for Women” while over a dozen female staffers stood behind her, forcibly masked like muzzled dogs. Therefore, for decades now, there has been a growing economic and cultural divide between the new upper classes and everyone else. This bifurcation was only accelerated with COVID. Unfortunately, the socio-economic and cultural rift is not the contentious division plaguing the United States. Hyperpolarization, which has also been transpiring for years now, was also hastened and intensified by the onset of COVID. The New Wars of Religion—Hyperpolarization and the American Body Politic We often take for granted how wise America’s Founding Fathers were. For all their faults, they were very astute when it came to structuring a Union that would check the most negative qualities of human nature. Much of this self-awareness came from their historical knowledge. Nowhere was this this understanding put to better use than the notion that the new nation should neither have nor espouse an official state religion, as the Founders were well aware of the destructive wars of religion that occurred a little over a century prior. What the Founders probably never imagined was that a spiritual battle would eventually occur within the country’s borders, but it would be secular in nature. This of course is the struggle we see between the left and the right—one that has transcended the political sphere and has slithered its way into almost every aspect of American life, including arenas that were traditionally a-political, such as sports, entertainment, business, etc. . In essence, this has become a religious conflict, and I don’t use that term lightly. What I mean is that there exists competing worldviews, adhered to by ideologically stringent segments who share conflicting views on morality and how society should be structured. They celebrate different ideals, including things that used to be held in common, such as country’s founding (1776 vs. 1619). They have competing ethics, holding different things sacred. They even engage in ceremony. For example, during the BLM protests, groups of demonstrators would raise their arms while chanting various social justice mantras, like Catholics reciting the Lord’s Prayer. Probably and most importantly, they possess an “us vs. them” mentality and will go to great lengths in order to achieve compliance from outsiders, even neutral ones—the so-called “silence is violence” mantra, for instance. They have their saints, usually politicians, commentators, and notable activists as well as their heretics, people who don’t toe exactly their doctrinal line and our thus cast out unceremoniously. Think of how feminists who are skeptical of transgender ideology are demeaned and labelled as trans exclusionary radical feminists (“TERFs”). And if you sin against the religion, you are expected to get on your knees and admit your guilt. They even speak different languages and display different symbols. For instance, if someone’s Instagram or Twitter bio displays their pronouns or a black raised fist, you can tell what side of the aisle they stand on. Likewise, if they exhibit an American flag and the word “patriot”. In other words, politics has become religion. The cultural struggle for America’s heart and soul has escalated into an ethereal feud almost reminiscent of the French Wars of Religion, though far less bloody (at least for now). What’s interesting is that this is not necessarily a struggle between Democrats and Republicans. In fact, in many ways, the conflict seems beyond the control of either party’s elites. The Democrats are split between the traditional, old score wing of their party and a far left contingent that, though numerically much smaller, is much louder, more aggressive, and has significant cultural and institutional power (more on this later). Meanwhile, the GOP has morphed into a bizarre coalition of traditional conservatives (Reaganites), Evangelical Christians, Libertarians and the populist right. We’ll start by going through how we ended up at this juncture. Undoubtedly, a considerable number will claim that it all began in 2016 with the election of Donald Trump. There is no question Trump will go down in history as one of the most polarizing figures in American politics. Moreover, he certainly divided the American public more than any president in recent history, possibly going all the way back to Lincoln, a man whose election precipitated state secessions. However, the notion that America’s hyperpolarization began with Trump just isn’t true, as the divide between left and right was occurring long before Trump became a candidate. For instance, a 2014 Pew research study showed that, since 1994, Americans have become increasingly divided. This was true not just in terms of voting patterns, but where Americans choose to live and whom to befriend. This was well over a year before Trump entered the presidential arena. Moreover, even with the Trump’s departure, along with him being made essentially irrelevant due to his social media banishment, the nation remains more divided than ever. In other words, if you imagine the American body politic as a biological entity, Trump was not the cancer. He was the pain that resulted from the cancer. And while you can treat the pain, the cancer will still remain, eating away at the body as the malignant organism slowly kills it. Graph depicts American political polarization from 1994, 2004 and 2014 Pew Research Center There are numerous theories suggesting how polarization got so out of control. I’ve read everything from it began with the election of Ronald Reagan and the right’s new epiphany that it should no longer accommodate the left, such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich’s policy of dissuading Republican Congressman from fraternizing with their liberal counterparts. The exit of the Greatest Generation from the political scene, and with them, the comradery men of both parties shared with one another via WWII service. The election of Barack Obama and his every increasing turn toward the so-called progressive left The demise of civility due to social media and its effects, whether it’s the construction of echo chambers for users (i.e. allowing people of similar, often radical, mindsets to readily connect even from disparate regions) or downgrading political discourse, since people allow their more hostile inhibitions to emerge through a screen as opposed to in-person. Or just the fact that people are generally more unhappy and stressed than were previous generations, which not only breeds more unwavering and extreme views but leads individuals to find purpose and companionship by joining political causes, no matter how extreme. I don’t know what the correct answer is here. If I had to guess, I would surmise that it’s probably a mix of all of the above to various degrees. Whatever the case, they have now reached a precarious juncture. For example, a 2019 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that half of Americans believed Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to get elected, despite this theory being thoroughly disproven. Meanwhile, a Newsweek article from December 21, 2021, reported that a third of Americans believe Joe Biden stole the election, even though no conclusive evidence has emerged to date that this was the case. Furthermore, if the 2020 election had gone in Trump’s favor, I’m almost certain large swathes of the public would have blamed voter suppression. This is all particularly concerning as it means presidents are now entering office with large portions of the public believing they’re illegitimate, just as major segments of the south viewed Lincoln following his 1860 electoral victory. Moreover, large swatches of Americans on both sides of the aisle now want secession. A July, 2021, article from The Hill reported that 37% of Americans would favor this. Personalities on both the right and the left, whether it’s The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh or comedian and wannabe political commentator Sarah Silverman, have suggested they would favor a national divorce. Realistically, this could never happen as secession in today’s landscape would be exceedingly difficult for a multitude of reasons. Nevertheless, it’s bothersome that close to two in five Americans would, at the very least, flirt with the idea of secession. The question now is how did COVID further this divide? There was the belief among many, including me, that the pandemic would reunite America. Generally speaking, even in times of great division, the United States is able to reunite quickly during times of national crisis. And during the pandemic’s first month, it seemed like this may indeed have been the case. Families and friends were reconnecting, calling each other constantly in order to mitigate isolation. In a moment when the national mood was driving a wedge between us, people were brought together by their mutual appreciation of each other and their love of Tiger King. Despite the obvious anxiety caused by the onset of this pandemic, it brought with it a strange heartwarming sentiment that we were all in this together. However, around mid to late April, I noticed a shift began to occur. As the lockdowns continued, there were large segments of the population than began protesting them as a violation of their personal liberties. This was particularly true in more liberal areas, which for reasons I’ll get to later, locked down much harder. There were two things interesting about the protests. First, they were mostly engaged in by individuals on the right side of the aisle. Second, was the reaction to them. I saw this firsthand on social media platforms, in which more liberally minded people attacked them as stupid, science deniers. Some even went so far as to call them murderers, because their actions could “kill grandma”. As mentioned above, a complete one-eighty occurred when the racial justice protests and riots broke out in late May. I’ll get into these in more depth later. However, their importance to our current discussion is that they activated people, particularly those more on the democratic side of the aisle, to embrace and espouse more radical, leftist theories (Again, I’ll dive more into this later.). They also had the net effect of angering the right, as the folks who were telling them to stay home or you were a bad person were now out in numbers that far exceeded the anti-lockdown protests. They were also angered that, as referred to above, many health officials and politicians engaged in this total reversal, as well. Indeed, I vividly recount this dramatic shift in the narrative. It was almost as if I had lived through one of those movies in where I went to bed and woke up the next day to everything being different, because someone traveled to the past and altered the present. And, of course, I’m the only one who could remember the original timeline. But I digress. What is certain is that the United States entered into what was undoubtedly its worse internal crisis since the Civil War. But whether it was the anti-lockdown protest, BLM riots, or the later January 6th storming of the Capital, there is little doubt that these events were, at least in large part, fueled by the stress and uncertainty that accompanied the pandemic. The COVID pandemic was as much a mental health crisis as physical one, igniting a powder keg of social and political instability that had been boiling for decades. Although the 2020 summer riots would eventually subside, unless you lived in Portland, COVID only continued to exacerbate the hyperpolarization—for instance, the issue over masks, which quickly became a right-left dividing line. Even to this day, the mask continues to function as more than just a way to prevent the spread, but as symbol of where your political leanings lie—almost a crucifix asserting how much you care about the pandemic. This is especially true by region. Today, if you live in a “red” area, masks are almost non-existent. Meanwhile, if you live in a “blue” area, mask mandates are often the first tool Democratic mayors and governors unleash to prevent the spread. It did not help that 2020 also happened to fall in an election year—the most contentious and bitter election we’ve had in a long time. What I found fascinating about the election was that this time around, it was not just about the candidates themselves, but also about their respective supporters. I’m sure if you spent even five minutes on your social media timelines, you probably saw this quite a bit. The tribal lines were drawn. And as the election drew nearer, the tension in the air felt thick enough to touch. Cities, particularly Washington D. C., boarded up in preparation for a new round of riots if Donald Trump was reelected. Of course, this never happened. However, the storming of the U. S. Capitol by several hundred Trump supporters definitely lent its fuel to the political firestorm. The fact that Biden’s inauguration occurred behind barbwire, patrolled by national guardsmen who were “politically screened” prior to the event, was quite the ominous image of to what depths the world’s most stable republic had descended to in the 21st century. But even with the election behind us, COVID continues to further polarize the American body politic. The battles over vaccine passports and forced vaccination of school children, have grown particularly fierce. In fact, the way different localities continue to handle COVID policy makes it feel like the United States has a de facto split, not into just two separate countries, but divergent realities. Democrat run states and cities, which appear to value safety among all else, continue to implement evasive measures and mask mandates. On the other hand, Republican areas, which appear much more freedom minded, valuing personal responsibility to stay safe rather than government enforcement, have remained open, even when surges occur. This led to none other than well-known liberal comedian Bill Maher in October, 2021, to comment, “I travel in every state now, back on the road, and the red states are a joy and the blue states are a pain in the ass. For no reason.” As someone who has traveled quite a bit in 2021, I can confirm that traveling from say Arizona to California is almost like stepping into a different universe. The same is true with regards to vaccine passports and mandates, as Democratic run areas are much more likely to be in favor of vaccine requirements in order to enjoy or utilize public accommodations, including restaurants and grocery stores. Moreover, Democrats are much more in favor of the administrative state being able to utilize its authority to force vaccination requirements and testing among American business than Republicans. The battle over this has encouraged many Republican governors to flat out say they will not enforce the federal government’s mandates within their states. To put simply, this has essentially become a fight between perceived ideals of personal liberty vs communal safety. Therefore, the COVID pandemic amplified the already substantial hyperpolarization plaguing the United States. I want to add before I continue that American disunion is nothing new to this nation and generally tends to come in waves. The bitterness between Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans and John Adam’s Federalists was immense and rather shocking considering they had just forged a new nation together. From the Civil War up until WWI, political division was substantial, as well. Moreover, the American government’s structure of checks and balances and division of powers was designed to create conflict in order to ensure liberty. The point I’m trying to assert here is that it’s not all doom and gloom. The United States is a nation that suffers from bipolar disorder. It goes through cycles of division, malaise, and Puritan level shame and guilt. Yet, it’s also able to quickly reassemble, becoming optimistic, proud and patriotic. The question is how serious is this political, societal, and cultural rupture and how it will work itself out in the end? Personally, I believe it will all work out for the good of the Nation. However, I now want to draw attention to what I contend has been one of the most damaging aspects of the current political discourse, an ideology that has not only been gaining prominence the last few decades, but was augmented by the Pandemic. This is the dogma of the new, or what is sometimes called the “woke” left. I’ll explain more in the following section. “Wokeness”: The Rise of a New and Destructive Secular Theology In November of 2021, PBS interviewed Chinese dissident, artist, and activist Ai Weiwei. Weiwei was born in Beijing in 1957 and is old enough to have experienced firsthand Chairman Mao’s Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. In fact, his childhood years were spent in forced labor camps, as his father was denounced and “purged” during the late-50s Anti-Rightist Movement. His family was later exiled to Xinjiang during the height of the Cultural Revolution. It was not until Mao’s death that Weiwei and his family were permitted to move back to Beijing. During the interview, the subject moved to authoritarianism and naturally Donald Trump. The interviewer than asked WeiWei if he saw Trump as an authoritarian. His answer was rather interesting. ""If you are authoritarian, you have to have a system supporting you. You cannot just be an authoritarian by yourself.” He continued by stating that the United States, “. . . was in the authoritarian state, you [we] just don’t know it.” He elaborated by expressing that the U.S. was currently undergoing something akin to the Chinese Cultural Revolution—certain forces attempting to have Americans “unified in a certain political correctness, which he believes “very dangerous.” Weiwei continued, “It’s very philosophical. With today’s technology, we know so much more than we really understand. The information [has] become jammed. But we don’t really — and really have the knowledge, because you don’t work. You don’t — You don’t have to act on anything. You just think you’re purified by certain ideas that you agree with it. That is posing dangers to society, to an extremely divided society.” In other words, Weiwei contends that the true threat to democracy and classical liberalism was not coming from far-right populism, but rather from the left—utilizing doctrinal theories and tactics similar to those utilized by the Red Guard and other Maoist organizations during the Cultural Revolution. I bring up this interview because I want to make it clear to the reader why I’ve decided to focus an entire section on this new far-left ideology rather than say far-right or white supremacist movements. It’s not because I don’t think the latter is dangerous, but because it doesn’t have nearly the same institutional and cultural power as this novel, persuasive, “Woke” ideology. As I will discuss later, almost every single American apparatus, from entertainment, education, sports, mainstream media and the halls of governmental power, has been usurped in one form or another, by this ideology. For instance, American corporations have adopted Woke sloganeering and required “equity” training for its employees. Even the United States military, typically viewed as a safe bastion of conservatism, has adopted much of this ideology, whether it’s in its recruiting videos, “recommendation” of reading materials such as works by Ibram X. Kendi, or the country’s top general, Mike Miley, defending the teacher of unsubstantiated concepts like “white rage.” By contrast, the alternative right and white supremacist do not, thankfully, enjoy the same societal legitimacy. There was a time when they unfortunately did. During the late part of the 19th and early part of the 20th century, “progressives,” as they were generally referred to, pushed such racist notions as Social Darwinism and the white man’s burden. This led to the study of “scientific racism,” the idea that some races were scientifically superior due to their ingenuity, intelligence, etc. For example, author and eugenicist advocate Madison Grant ranked the various races by intelligence, prowess and other features. Even amongst Caucasians, he crafted a hierarchy, with Mediterranean people, like the Italians, being on the spectrum’s lowest end. There was, of course, no real, hard, scientific evidence proving any of his theories. Nonetheless, his views caught a wide audience, especially with a particular German nationalist party following World War I. Luckily, as the 20th century rolled on, this mode of thinking largely became discredited. This was especially true after the horrors of the Holocaust, which was primarily predicated on Social Darwinist beliefs, as they became known. This does not mean everything was, so to speak, hunky-dory. Jim Crow laws, for instance, existed in large portions of the country until the 1960’s. Nevertheless, as the century wore on, such beliefs became even more discredited. This is not to say the alternative right or white supremacy group doesn’t still exist. It certainly does. And its disciples have caused damage, such as Dylan Roof, the young man who shot up a South Carolina black church. However, the ideology does not have mainstream backing, and its adherents are largely viewed as social pariahs, which most Americans agree is a good thing. However, the intersectional left is not only mainstream, it’s being actively promulgated by a wide assortment of American public and private institutions. This is ironic because many of the key tenants of the Woke ideology mirror those of the alternative right, which I will elaborate on later in this essay. The important thing to note is that this leftist ideology is ascendant and has been for quite some time. And this brings me to another key reason I want to focus on regarding this ideology. It’s not just because it has mainstream approval, but because it is authoritarian in its premises. Moreover, it poses a significant threat to the national mood and the country’s social and political stability, significantly more than any other radical philosophy. This includes traditional Communism, for which Woke dogma is structurally based on (I’ll expand more on this later on). This doesn’t mean I believe this new leftist philosophy will forever ascend. In fact, it will certainly collapse upon itself like a dying star. Nevertheless, it has already brought about significant damage and has the potential to do more during the coming decade. I’ll start by giving a brief overview of the origins of this ideology. I can’t go into all of the philosophy’s nooks and crannies or else this essay would be book length. Furthermore, academics such as James Lindsay and Jonathan Haidt have done yeoman’s work explaining, in depth, this philosophy’s roots. So, if you’d like a more complete analysis, I’d check them out. However, I’ll do my best to present a succinct picture of this complex, doctrinal matrix. Before I continue, I want to make clear that I’ll be using various terms interchangeably when referring to this ideology, such as “wokeness,” “new leftism,” and “social justice”. I do this not just for variety but because, if I’m being honest, I’m not sure exactly what the most meaningful way to refer to this is. This is partially due to the fact that, unlike other ideologies or secular religious dogmas, this doctrine’s origins are rather muddled. This is because it spawned from an amalgamation of various academic disciplines, some related to each other and others not (more on this later). And since I unfortunately don’t know how future historians will label this movement, I’ll just swap terms in order to keep a sense of variety. From the research I’ve done and conversations I’ve had, I know there are many people who assume this movement began around 2010, give or take a few years, reaching its pinnacle as a reaction to the 2016 election of Donald Trump. In terms of the latter contention, I believe there is some truth to this. This Woke doctrine definitely went into hyper-drive following Trump’s ascent. However, like many issues revolving around Trump’s presidency, this tells only part of the story. In fact, I would argue that Trump’s victory should in many ways be viewed as the “overcorrection” to the social justice movement—the anti-political correctness, take-no-prisoners, bull-in-the-china shop who was elected as a means to push against absurdities of the Woke movement. As mentioned earlier, the movement itself is difficult to define, since it encompasses a variety of leftist academic theories, many of which doctrinally contradict each other. At the expense of being overly simplistic, social justice is the concept of tearing down what are deemed to be oppressive structures. This could the “patriarchy,” “white privilege,” “heteronormative value systems” to name a few. It’s largely based upon the idea of “collective justice,” rather than individual, as groups such as women, Muslims, blacks, gays, transgenders are deemed to be part of certain cadres that have been subjugated by power apparatus. The actual roots of the social justice phenomena are quite complicated. There’s no one origin story for it, since it is in many ways a consolidation of numerous radical theorems, such as gender theory, critical race theory, etc. This makes it unique among doctrines, the vast majority of which have a single root, like the Communist Manifesto for Marxism. Nevertheless, the general consensus is it began sometime after the Second World War. This is when disillusioned, leftist, German intellectuals, often referred to as the Frankfurt School, came to the realization that modern Communism was failing. Not only were Communist states significantly poorer and more oppressive than capitalist nations, but were nowhere near to achieving the utopia that Marx had foreseen. Furthermore, leftist revolutions were not occurring in the industrialized West, which went against Marxism’s supposedly ‘scientific theory’ of class struggle, referred to as “dialectic materialism,” i.e. the Marxist contention that political are social events result from a conflict of social forces over material needs. Instead of reexamining their beliefs, these academics argued that the reason the proletariat revolution hadn’t occurred was because the bourgeois had constructed culture to insure it didn’t occur. Hence, in order to bring about this leftist revolution, culture had to be “deconstructed.” This philosophy came to view of all Western society as an apparatus of oppressive power constructs, which needed to be broken down. Academics such as Herbert Marcuse, Michael Foucault, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer manufactured a variety of think pieces dedicated to this proposition. As a side note, I read Adorno’s and Horkheimer’s The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception for a college level political philosophy class. It was interesting, but read like something written by a jaded lover whining about how stupid their ex was for dumping them. Yet, in this case, it was grumbling about why it was that the masses didn’t support leftist revolution. But I digress. This coincided with the French postmodernist movement of 1960’s, which, like the Frankfurt School, was mostly made up of disenchanted Communists who rejected the premise of objective fact for the notion that most things, such as race, gender, religion, age, were social constructs that needed to be deconstructed. Eventually, these theories found their way into American academia, which by the 1990’s had become predominantly more left-leaning. This led to academic institutions setting up a variety of new departments dedicated to topics like gender theory, queer theory, etc. All this eventually cumulated in a mixing and matching of ideas and theories, which produced the Hines 57 philosophy we know today. Thus, what was created was an ideology that was structurally Marxist in the sense that it viewed the world in terms of a power struggle between repressive and oppressed forces. However, it differed in the fact that economic and social classes were not distinctive features of such a struggle. Rather, it was aspects like race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc. This is where the idea of “intersectionality” came in to play, a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw that essentially opined that someone could be part of multiple oppressed groups, which meant one could be higher or lower on the intersectional hierarchy of oppression based on how many immutable characteristics defined them. This isn’t necessarily incorrect. For instance, if you were a black woman living in the Jim Crow South, you were a second-class citizen, not only because of racial discrimination, but because you couldn’t vote due to your gender. The intersectionality concept is bizarre for two reasons. First, it attempts to unite aggrieved societal groups that generally don’t have much in common around that idea that their victimhood statuses “intersect” at various points. This is why you can have transgender and gay rights activists stand up for the rights of Palestinians against what they see as the oppressive Israeli regime, despite the fact that many within these traditional Muslim communities are vocally opposed to this lifestyle. Second, it sets up a not always clear victimhood hierarchy. For instance, a black man is high on the victim level, but not as high as say a gay black man, which isn’t as high as a transgender black woman, etc. What’s strange about this conceptualization is it doesn’t take into account an individual’s distinctiveness. Rather, it is immutable characteristics that define where someone lies on the spectrum. It doesn’t matter, for example, that a straight, white, cisgender man (the ones at the lowest end of the intersectional spectrum) may have grown up in a dirt poor family, within a rundown, rural area to drug addicted and abusive parents. He is still below the scale of say a black woman who grew up in wealthy suburban neighborhood because he has privilege. In other words, Martin Luther King Jr.’s notion of “judge one by the content of their character and not the color of their skin” goes completely out the window. Thus, it’s ironically similar to the old notions of scientific racism promulgated by Madison Grant, in that it sets up a hierarchical ranking based on nothing more than innate features. In fact, the only other ideology as obsessed with race is white supremacy. This is the reason why you inexplicably find white supremacists and Woke on the same side of some issues. Side note: if you ever need a good laugh, look up comedian Ryan Long’s sketch “When Wokes and Racists Actually Agree on Everything.” It depicts a Woke person and a white racist as best friends since they are in agreement on pretty much everything except which way the hierarchy should go. But, I digress. White supremist and self-proclaimed founder of the alternative right, Richard Spencer, retweeting his agreement with Ibram X. Kendi. This is one of many examples of white supremacists and the Woke sharing almost identical beliefs. Twitter This leads into what makes this ideology truly bizarre, and thus its inherent contradictions. For example, it’s well accepted now within this doctrine that men can become men and women can become women. In other words, gender is a spectrum, which can differ from what one’s biological sex was*. However, this is not the same when it comes to race, as a white person cannot become a black person. This does not make logical sense as, for instance, a situation where you have two siblings, a white man and woman along with a black man. Despite being genetically related, the white man and black man will biologically, and even psychologically, have significantly more in common with each other than the white man and his sister. Nevertheless, because being black is higher on the intersectional scale than being a woman, Rachel Dolezal is treated like a pariah while Elliot Page, formerly Ellen Page, is celebrated as a hero. Its illogical nature extends to other facets, as well. For example, radical or third wave feminism is committed to destroying the so-called and amorphous patriarchy. However, because radical feminism intersects with Muslims, who often also identified as oppressed “people of color,” they willfully ignore the abysmal treatment women suffer within the Islamic world. In other words, they try to tear down the society that is the most equitable in terms of gender relations while ignoring the planet’s most patriarchal and sexist societies. This promulgation of racial essentialism and indemnity politics brings with it a revolutionary historical worldview, akin to that advocated by traditional Marxism. In this view, the classical liberal principles upon which the United States were founded are a lie. The American story is not about a free nation unshackling itself from a monarchy, but rather a country constructed by white men, for white men—a nation whose every institution was infused with racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. This narrative is a direct contradiction to traditional notions of American history—that the United States was founded upon righteous principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Yet, the country did not fully live up to these principles, gradually expanding rights to others. The notion that, as Dr. King and Frederick and Douglas have stated, the liberal rights espoused within the Declaration of Independence were a promissory note that had yet to be fulfilled for African-Africans; that it was these principles that launched the abolitionist movement that eventually led to slavery’s long overdue extinction; that this led to the success of the American Civil Rights movement, and the true fulfillment of the concept that all men (and women) are created equal. This is where the more militant and revolutionary aspects of the ideology creep up, as it asserts that all societal pillars need to be demolished, since they were created to maintain the oppressive white, heteronormative, patriarchy. This includes governmental, cultural, economic institutions that need to be torn down. Even generally neutral and/or stabilizing foundations such as science, capitalism, math, and free expression are seen as instruments of control by the white, patriarchal superstructure, and thus, need to be deconstructed. This is necessary in order to achieve not equality, but “equity,” a concept that states that certain people should have an advantage over others, depending upon whether or not they are privileged or under privileged based on their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, identity, etc. Again, socio-economic class, or one’s individual hardships, are ignored in favor of external characteristics. This is where concepts such as “anti-racism” come into play. This is the notion that every structure of the United States have been infused with racism and white supremacy, and thus must be actively challenged. It includes the idea that every policy or prescription that leads to inequity or seemingly racially disproportional impact is racist, including things such as seemingly neutral as capitalism, meritocracy-based education, climate change, etc. This also includes the supposition that anti-racist discrimination (discrimination against those at the bottom of the intersectional hierarchy) is needed to combat racial discrimination of the past. If that doesn’t appear to make logical sense, it’s because “racism” itself is defined not as treating someone differently based on their ethnicity, but racism plus power. Hence, you can’t be racist if you are of a race that is seen as not having agency. All this taken together naturally means that ethnicity must be taken into account for everything, whether economic, political or cultural, essentially racializing every single aspect of American life. To quote Ibram X. Kendi, “The most threatening racist movement is not the alt right’s unlikely drive for a White ethno-state, but the regular American’s drive for a ‘race-neutral one.” Another feature of this that is important to understand is the belief within this new leftist movement that human beings are malleable. In other words, that human nature can be modified. This is why figures such as Kendi and Robin DiAngelo are paid millions by corporations and governmental organizations to put their employees through racial equity training, which focuses on such unproven and pseudo-scientific concepts like unconscious bias. So why did this ideology take off within the United States, especially within the last decade? There are a multitude of factors. First, is the fact that the social justice movement plays to Americans’ good nature. I know this may surprise some readers, as it goes against what’s been the dominant media narrative, but the United States is one of world’s most accepting and tolerant nations. I’m not just saying this based on personal observation, but actual empirical studies like the World Values Survey. Moreover, interracial marriage has increased drastically within the USA. A 2021 Gallup poll showed that 94% of Americans now approve of the practice. Even during the Black Lives Matter protests/riots (which I’ll get into later), it was telling how many Americans of all backgrounds stood up in solidarity against racism, whether real and perceived. From a historical perspective, this is quite remarkable considering that the country’s ethnically heterogeneous nature. It’s easy to create a well-functioning, tolerant and cohesive society when you’re a relatively homogeneous nation like Norway or Denmark. However, it’s often difficult for multi-ethic nation states to maintain stability, as they often either experience frequent social unrest or even outright collapse (think the Astro-Hungarian Empire, Yugoslavia, or the multitude of African nations). Despite what Americans may even believe about their own country, the nation is an outlier in terms of its compassion and acceptance of others, even if it has sometimes struggled with these issues in the past. This American desire to assist the downtrodden is noble. It corresponds nicely to the Judeo-Christian principles of compassion and empathy, which have been longstanding features of American society. This is all well and good. However, the problem is that unlike most established religions, this dogma does not abide by a strict moral framework of which actions are permissible to achieve these seemingly noble aims. Like Marxism, this new leftism espouses a utopian vision. Thus, the ends always justify the means since the movement is on the right side of history (This was the same with Nazism too, which believed in the utopian vision of a Germanic ethno-state, thereby legitimizing their crime against humanity for the “greater good.”) This is the reason why so many of society’s cruelest, mean spirited, insecure and anti-social members join this movement, because the philosophy create a facade of righteousness for which they can lash out at others. I’m not trying to argue that all social justice warriors are evil. In fact, many of those who are involved or pay lip service to the movement do so out of genuine compassion. However, as with all ideologies that advocate tearing down societal pillars in order to achieve self-prescribed noble ends, it tends to attract an extremely aggressive and nefarious element. As Aldous Huxley opined, “The surest way to work up a crusade in favor of some good cause is to promise people they will have a chance of maltreating someone. To be able to destroy with good conscience, to be able to behave badly and call your bad behavior 'righteous indignation' — this is the height of psychological luxury, the most delicious of moral treats.” The second reason this doctrine gained so much prominence is because the United States has never seriously been plagued by economic class divides. Unlike, say, the United Kingdom, which maintained an established socio-economic hierarchy during feudalism, then transitioned to the birth of new classes that competed with the old order during its Industrial Revolution, America has not had an entrenched socio-economic pyramid. Yes, the United States has always maintained some semblance of an economic and financial elite. Nevertheless, for a variety of reasons, the social upward/downward mobility and fluidity between classes has always been rather comprehensive. This was something Alexis de Tocqueville noticed when he famously depicted his American travels. This is one of the reasons why traditional Communism never really took off in the United States, since the theory is exclusively based upon ingrained class distinction and class warfare. However, where the United States has unfortunately struggled is with its multi-ethnic nature. There has undoubtedly been a history of racial tension, which has been handled to various degrees of success. Whether it was slavery or Jim Crow, dealing with Indigenous people, or managing the diverse array of immigrants flooding to its shores, America has had both numerous successes and failures. For instance, the United States is without question the premier nation when it comes to the assimilation of immigrants from a wide array of disparate cultures and background. Nevertheless, discrimination against immigrant groups upon their arrival such as Irish, Italians, Asians and Latin Americans has definitely occurred. But even if the modern nation has generally become a beacon of tolerance, this history still exists, which is why the Woke ideology hats been significantly more successful than old school Marxism. This plays into the third reason, which is the country’s Puritan origins. Very few societies are as self-reflecting or as guilt-ridden as the United States. This mostly has to do with its Puritan/Christian foundations. This hasn’t necessarily been a negative, as it has allowed the country to come to terms with actions that didn’t live up to its founding liberal ideals, such as slavery, Jim Crow, the internment of Japanese Americans, etc. However, it has also meant the country’s populace is frequently way too hard on itself, with Americans regularly absorbing the culpability for sins they did not commit (or even if their ancestors due to a large number of Americans descending from immigrants who arrived later in the 19th/early 20th centuries). The final reason has to do with something I discussed earlier—the current demographic issues the United States is facing. Whenever societies face such conundrums, certain segments of the populace (predominantly the youth) naturally turn towards ideologies as ways to find meaning and alleviate their problems. This is particularly true in regard to the country’s current youth, Generation Z, which has, for a variety of reasons, been prone to adopting the Woke ideological dictums. I won’t go into this here, but if you would like to explore this dilemma further, I’d recommend Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff’s work The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure. The internet and social media have exacerbated this problem. Not only can radical ideas spread to a wider audience, but like-minded individuals can now discover each other, something which they were unable to do before. This is true for ideologies on the radical right, as well; but I would argue, as stated earlier, the new left has been given more mainstream prevalence on these social media platforms. All this taken together has hence created the perfect storm for this Woke dogma to spread. This was particularly true on college campuses, where concepts such as trigger warnings, microaggressions, and cultural appropriation really started to pick up steam after 2012. Haidt and Lukianoff even penned a 2015 article about this in The Atlantic, a precursor to The Codling of the American Mind. However, it was the COVID-19 pandemic that caused these ideas to violently explode like a powder keg. And I don’t use the adjective “violently” as a euphemism. What transpired was quite without question the fiercest and most widespread political instability this nation has faced since the American Civil War. And no, that’s not an exaggeration. It began with the Ahmaud Arbery incident, in which a former police officer as well as two other vigilantes chased down and killed a young black man, believing he was casing out a construction site. Arbery was killed back in February. However, in what appeared to some as a corrupt deal with the local D.A., the trio did not get punished. This caused the video to be released, depicting the disturbing ordeal of an unarmed Arbery being murdered. Of course, what really set everything ablaze (pun intended) was the killing of George Floyd, which was depicted on a phone video by a local bystander. What followed was mass civil unrest, the likes of which haven’t been witnessed in the United States since the 1860’s. Protests and riots broke out in almost every major city in America. Businesses were ransacked and looted while police stations and other public buildings vandalized and ignited. In the span of just one month, billions of dollars of damage had been committed, while over 2,000 law enforcement officers and countless civilians were injured. Portland was ransacked, with a federal courthouse there literally being put under siege. Residence of Beverly Hills were put under a 1:00 PM curfew, while rioters were allowed to run roughshod over Rodeo Drive. Meanwhile, a full-on insurrection occurred within Seattle as part of the area seceded from the United States to form CHOP or CHAZ. I know it’s funny to laugh about now, considering that CHOP completely collapsed, as its residents couldn’t even provide basic necessities for themselves. But the fact that an area, no matter how small, was allowed to effectively declare itself independent is outrageous. The entire ordeal also becomes much less humorous when one remembers that the CHOP’s security forces ended up murdering two teenagers, both of whom were African American. Rioting would continue periodically throughout the summer. Chicago was forced to lift the bridges of its downtown area in order to prevent further insurrection, like a scene from the film Batman Begins. Unrest also broke out in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after the shooting of Jacob Blake, a riot which was caused almost exclusively by the media’s reporting malfeasance. (For the record, it was originally reported that Blake had stopped to break up a fight before he was harassed, then shot by police. A snippet of the video was then released to the public, showing just the immediate shooting. However, police were actually called because Blake allegedly digitally raped a woman. Moreover, a more complete version of the video show that Blake not only resisted arrested, but reached for a pocketknife, the latter to which Blake himself admitted in a later interview). Since we’re on the topic of the media, it appears that they almost encouraged the riots. This was not just in their awful coverage of stories, whether it was the “Karen in Central Park” or the Bubba Watson incident, to name a few. This included giving misleading information, much of it later proven to be either dubious or flat-out untrue regarding other police-civilian interactions. For instance, the Chicago story of an unarmed black man shot in the back while running from the police, which sparked the Chicago riot, turned out to be fabricated. Many media members even went to significant lengths to excuse the riots. A great example of this is disgraced mainstream pundit Chris Cuomo, who went so far as to ask the question, “Where does it say in the First Amendment that protests need to be peaceful?” This is not even taking into consideration the numerous people on social media who gave credence to the rioters, often going so far as to say white people had the right to criticize their actions even if a good portion of the communities ransacked were predominantly African American. I go into more detail on this phenomenon in an article I penned last year, “The Normalization of Political Violence: The Roman Republic and the United States.” If you want more information, check it out. Furthermore, a string of “cancellations” began against people who committed “wrong think,” both against celebrities and ordinary people. For instance, there emerged a video of a twenty-two-year-old college student using the N-word (“a” not “er”) when she was sixteen, after earning her driver’s license. A large social media mob then took it upon themselves to destroy her, revealing who she was and contacting every educational institution and employment venue she was affiliated with. I said earlier that the social justice movement attracts some of society’s worst and most anti-social elements, insecure people who want nothing more than to release their inner frustrations and angst upon the world. The cancel culture mobocracy is a perfect example of this. What made the riots more disturbing was that they were accompanied by something akin to the Chinese Cultural Revolution, which I referenced at the start of this chapter. Similar to the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution, they demanded the renaming of streets, schools, buildings, etc. They began vandalizing historical monuments and ripping down statues of prominent historical figures. And not just of Confederate generals, but figures such as General Grant and President Lincoln. This mode of thinking would eventually find its way into public policy, such as the city of San Francisco voting to retitle a school named after Lincoln because he didn’t care about black lives. And no, that’s not a joke. Although the city later reversed its decision following the backlash. The point is that the movement was more much than just a riot/protest for racial justice and police reform. It took on the structural form of the radical militarism of the new left—an attempt to demolish all societal pillars and foundations, whether of government, culture or economics, in order to build a new civilization. But as with all utopian visions, whether left or right, it led to mass destruction, suffering, and death. This cultural, economic and political reconstruction was sold to large swathes of the American public under the guise of eliminating what was dubbed “systemic racism.” The term systemic racism is a bit of a nebulous term, because it is still not entirely clear what activists mean when they say it. For instance, structures like race-based slavery, Apartheid, and Jim Crow Laws were unquestionably systemically racist apparatuses. However, the lines here were fairly unclear, as I’ll explain soon. What’s important is the label itself became used to further this revolutionary fervor for radical, structural dismantlement and reconstruction. Take the case that ignited this movement, George Floyd’s death. There is still zero evidence to this day that Derek Chauvin, the officer who was accused of killing Floyd, ever harbored racist intent. In fact, during Chauvin’s later murder trial, racial animus was never even brought up by the prosecution. (Side note: there was evidence of racial hostility present in the Ahmaud Arbery incident). But in reality, Chauvin’s intent never mattered because he was seen as being a part of systemically racist police system that allowed this to happen in the first place. For example, in modern America, a significant portion of the country’s metropolitan regions are largely minority run. Whether it’s Atlanta, Dallas, or Richmond, many of these cities have black mayors, black city council men and women, black police chiefs and police departments that are mostly comprised of minority personnel. The Los Angeles Police Department, for instance, is plurally Hispanic, while the Atlanta P.D. is 58% African American. Furthermore, federal police agencies like the United States Border Patrol are 51% Latino. However, the demographic makeup is irrelevant under new leftism, as they believe these systems of power were built to be racist and maintain the white, cis gendered, male hierarchy. This is how you got the bizarre, and frankly, humorous incidents in which videos emerged of white women screaming at black cops over historic, American racism. This was because even though the cops were African American, they were part of the white supremacist system. It’s how a predominantly white Seattle city council could force out the city’s black female police chief without any Woke activist batting an eye, as she is involved in maintaining the white racial hierarchy. All this led to calls from activists and even prominent politicians to “defund” police departments. Many cities did this, helping lead to the massive urban crime and murder spike we’re witnessing today, particularly in minority communities. This is because the killing of African Americans by police officers is actually very minute —nine in 2019 according to FBI data, which is low considering the millions of interactions police have with the public each year. However, 55.9% of American homicide offenders in 2019 were black with 91% of the victims being other African Americans. In other words, when police departments were defunded or cops pulled back from high crime areas, it actually led to more violence and suffering within these communities. This isn’t to say there aren’t reforms that should be made to American policing. Nevertheless, the fanatical nature of the anti-police movement caused immense hardship, particularly to the most vulnerable. All this was done in the name of a radical movement based on a flawed assumption that American policing is systemically racist. For the record, I’m not arguing there isn’t racism within police departments or cops who don’t abuse their authority. More that, by in large, the evidence of widespread racial bias within modern police departments is not as clear-cut as many politicians and media pundits would have you believe. I recommend the article, “The Myth of Systemic Police Racism” by Heather MacDonald for an in-depth analysis). The other aspect of this that is similar to the Chinese Cultural Revolution is the social justice crusade’s religious connotation. In the earlier chapter regarding the American political divide, the conflict between social and political forces was, for all intents and purposes, a religious struggle. In regard to the 2020 riots, the social movement became as devout as a secular creed, just as any other cult or theology before it. Like an inquisition, social justice rioters would demand compliance, not just from their followers, but from corporations and even innocent bystanders. There are still videos online depicting protesters surrounding people at outdoor restaurants, demanding they raise their fists in solidarity with black lives matters. Just like any fundamentalist movement, any questioning of the faith was met with intense anger, sometimes even threats or violence. They even conducted what I can only described as religious ceremonies. For example, when a multitude of white people were recorded on their knees, raising their hands to a group of African Americans, begging for forgiveness, essentially an attempt to absolve themselves of the original sin of being white. It sort of reminded me of the Middle Ages, when the Bishop of Toulouse would get to slap some random Jew every Easter because his ancestors crucified Christ. Major institutions began to get into the fray. I mentioned earlier that numerous corporations released statements in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, donating billions to the organization. I should add that at the time I’m writing this section, Black Lives Matter is currently being investigated by multiple jurisdictions for the misappropriation of funds. But, I digress. Even governmental organizations got involved. For instance, a chart made its way around segments of the United States military depicting “overt white supremacy” and cover white supremacy,” the latter denial of white privilege, meritocracy myth, colorblindness and weaponized whiteness (I still don’t know what that means). As I suggested above, because social justice is essentially a secular religious movement, most of its tenets are not based on any scientific or analytic research. To be fair, the chart was not officially released or promoted by the military, as it found its way into emails and at military bases for still murky reasons. Pyramid depicting ""overt white supremacy"" and ""covert white supremacy"" However, a diagram was officially released by the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. It illustrated “aspects and assumptions of white culture in the United States.” Such things as the nuclear family, objective, rational linear thinking, quantitative analysis, hard work being the key to success, delayed gratification, among other things, are depicted as part of white culture, which has been normalized and internalized by people of color, since whites are America’s dominant political force. This is insane for two reasons. First, non-European cultures and peoples value things such as hard work and delayed gratification. Second, it’s probably one of the single most racist things propagated by a government institution in modern times, and not against Caucasians. This is because this document reads as if it was written by Richard Spencer or KKK leader David. For within the white supremacist mindset, is the belief that all positive facets of economics, culture, and politics were invented solely by Caucasians, which is why they believe them to be superior. Chart displaying aspects and assumptions about whiteness and white culture released by the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. This is where you get into some of the more inexplicable aspects of this already peculiar doctrine. As mentioned earlier, social justice sees any inequity as naturally being the result of discrimination, even if there is no evidence of it. It’s why some states and cities took steps to advanced school classes or why you get articles in USA Today questioning if math education is racist. What’s intriguing about this is that when it comes to high educational or economic achievements, whites don’t even dominate these arenas, as it’s disproportionately East Asians and Indians within these sectors. In fact, if you look at an American STEM field today, it’s often majority persons who are ancestrally from Asian regions. In terms of household income, Asians and Indians are at the top of spectrum. Another interesting tidbit is that Nigerian Americans make over three thousand dollars more than the average white American. I bring this up because the other ugly aspect of this ideology is the belief that other races that get ahead in America do so because they internalize whiteness and use white supremacist thinking to advance. This is exactly what a San Francisco School Board member Alison Collins said in 2016. Until relatively recently, Asians were often dubbed “white adjacent”. For instance, 1619 project architect Nikole Hannah Jones responded to a tweet saying, “These days, I am reminded quite often that you do not have to be white to support white supremacy”. She said, “Whiteness is not static and is expandable when necessary. A lot of folks we don’t think of as white think themselves white because the lines have never been entirely clear. That’s the beauty of white supremacy—it’s extremely adaptable.” It was not until the 2021 shooting of a massage parlor, mostly consisting of Asian workers, that this narrative started to be curtailed, as Asians took their place among the victimized people of color category. This, despite the fact the motives of the shooters didn’t appear to be based on race (it was some bizarre belief in which he thought he couldn’t control his sexual urges unless the place was destroyed) and that, over the past several years, most  anti-Asian hate crimes have unfortunately been perpetrated by African American men. Yet, the question remains—considering how radical and irrational this ideology is, how is that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated its proliferation? As I noted previously, this doctrine has been on the rise for a while. Although I can’t present empirical evidence here, since it does not exist, it was undoubtedly the lockdowns. The stress caused by the pandemic, along with the all the other uncertainties that came with it, combined to create the perfect powder keg. All it needed was a spark to ignite it. As I’ve suggested, times of angst and insecurity cause individuals to adopt radical, often ridiculous beliefs in order to feel secure and find meaning in this chaotic era. This has been true throughout history. The Catholic Church, for example, was traditionally the premier Medieval institution of science and learning. It even generally treated Jews well. But it was not until the Black Death that the Church, along with the greater European populace, lost its collective mind, adopting bizarre beliefs, killing Jews because they believed they were poisoning the water supply. It’s sad when you consider that, for a brief moment during the early days of the pandemic, it seemed that this collective challenge would bring us together, akin to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Family and friends were reconnecting; and people who didn’t know each other were connecting over their shared fascination with Tiger King.  And even the media and Trump seemed to put their differences aside. Unfortunately, the Pandemic only exacerbated these underlying issues, intensifying the already deep fissures plaguing American civilization. And it continues to this day. For example, government institutions have adopted equity-training programs, teaching essentially a significant portion of what was explained above. Private companies have done the same. Coca-Cola’s diversity training was actually leaked—a program in which employees were urged to be less white, espousing that “In the U.S. and other Western nations, white people are socialized to feel that they are inherently superior because they are white.” Or take the Denver elementary school that put on a “families of color playground night”, which reportedly done in the name of equity and seemly excluded children of certain racial backgrounds. Although the school later denied this was the case, most likely because of the intense backlash it received. The satirical newspaper, the Babylon Bee, published a brilliant article on the matter. But, I digress. It's too funny not to share The Babylon Bee So, where do we go from here? If there is one prediction made within this article that I’m most certain of it’s that the social justice movement will eventually collapse. This is because of it’s confusing, irrational ideas which are replete with self-contradictions. Moreover, it pushes an authoritarian worldview, demanding compliance and obedience, which is something every-day Americans will not accept in the long run. This ideology also leads to insane and frankly, diabolical polices, such as CDC’s original plan for vaccine plan that was discussed in the first chapter. Finally, instead of promoting racial and social harmony, it actually exacerbates these problems, forcing people to focus on immutable characteristics, telling them they are oppressors or moral victims based on how they look or how they were born, and does nothing but cause mental angst, depression and anger for all parties involved. Now that these concepts are being pushed on to children. This, along with radical gender theory being pandered to children, has caused an extreme parental backlash, which was undoubtedly the reason why the deep Blue State of Virginia elected a Republican governor last year. Thus, the question is not if new leftism will collapse, but when and how. The backlash is already here, and it will unquestionably grow. Yet, almost more important is how will it collapse? I say this because, if I had to guess, it will be thanks to a ballot box. However, I do worry that if this ideology, in a last gasp for survival, inspires more cataclysmic ordeals like it did during 2020, there could be consequences beyond what many Americans could imagine—particularly, the rise of the far right. If Karl Marx were alive today, he would have been surprised to learn that not only did Communist revolutions almost always fail within the industrialized world, but that they only really succeeded in pre-industrial, agricultural-centric nations. Industrial and post-industrial nations rarely succumb to leftist revolutions. This is because there is a strong middle class that will not accept the system being overthrow by radicals who want a complete economic, political, and social overhaul. On the other hand, pre-industrial and developing states that contain massive peasantries, who are often mistreated, and hence have nothing to lose by toppling the state and implementing an entirely new system, may support this take over, even though that new system is usually identical to, and often times worse than, the one that came before it. I note this because what usually occurs within developed nations is that a leftist uprising will occur. And if the government is unable to suppress such an insurrection, far right elements will take matters into their own hands. This is what happened in Italy during the 1920’s. Socialist riots and rebellions occurred throughout the country. With the national government being unable to respond, the Fascists took it upon themselves to crush the uprisings, thereby legitimizing themselves in the eyes of the Italian public. I believe it’s very unlikely we will reach this juncture. America is a dynamic society. It’s populace, generally speaking, values its classically liberal traditions and institutions. Nonetheless, if insurrections sprout up again like they did in 2020 and the state is either unwilling or unable to act, this process could definitely occur. Stranger things have happened before. Political violence and instability often breeds outcomes that even the perpetrators of such actions can’t foresee. Hence, we should all hope this new leftist doctrine meets history’s dustbin soon and without major incident, lest something even worse emerges. The Social Dilemma: The Crackdown on Dissent and Re-Establishment of the Narrative I remember once being asked on a test from a university level, American history course, “Which invention was more significant: the nuclear bomb or the television? Explain why.” Solid arguments could be made for either contention. However, to this day, I still contend that it’s the television, as it changed the way we spread and consume information. The T.V. is probably the reason John F. Kennedy barely beat Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential election, as the younger Kennedy just looked better on screen than his opponent. Moreover, there’s a good argument to be made that it’s what allowed the Civil Rights Movement to succeed, as Americans, and the rest of world, were able to view firsthand the horrible treatment of black Americans within Jim Crow states. The point is, whenever there comes into existence a novel way to spread and disseminate information, significant economic, political and societal transformation inevitably follow. The inventions of the printing press, telegram, radio and television all brought with them substantial ancillary effects—some good, some bad. The internet and, by extension, social media, have been no exception to this rule. In fact, social media’s impact has arguably been larger than its predecessors. This is for two reasons. First, social media allows almost anyone to easily and efficiently add their voices or content to the conversation. Second, is just the mass scope of information that can spread through the social web. For instance, Google and Facebook (now Meta) by themselves contain more information than every single 1980’s intelligence agency combined, probably by degrees of one-hundredfold or more. Social media giants’ algorithms have constructed accurate and all-encompassing profiles of their users (such as their likes and dislikes, products and content that they’ll probably be interested in sometime in the future, etc.) to an extent that would have shocked and dismayed even the Soviet KGB. Thus, the sheer mass of data flowing through social media and controlled by its platforms far exceeds anything in human history. This means that social media has had an enormous impact on not only how we consume and spread information, but how business and advertisements are done, how political campaigns are run, how social and grass roots movements are organized, etc.. What’s even wilder is that because this technology is still in its infancy, we really don’t know to what overall extent it will impact us. Social media’s influence has far exceeded what many people thought possible back in the days of MySpace and Tumblr. Its effects on our relationships, mental health, and work life are just a few of the issues that have emerged from this Pandora’s Box. I’m sure some of you reading this have seen the documentary The Social Dilemma, which inspired the primary title of this section. However, I’m not going to go into all these matters. Not only would it make this essay way too long, but frankly, I don’t even understand most of it. In fact, I doubt most of us do. Yet, I do want to focus on one particular aspect that began prior to COVID and was greatly accelerated by its emergence. This is the proliferation of social media censorship in order to maintain particular narratives. You’ve probably noticed this shift. In the early days of the internet, the general consensus was that it would be a bastion of free speech—where people from around the world can express their thoughts on ideas openly, without risk of punishment. Early forum sites such as Reddit promoted this notion. There was even the belief among many that the internet would eventually bring democracy to China. During the 2009 Iranian protests and Arab Spring, for example, social media was the primary means by which demonstrators organized. Yet, over the years mainstream views on the internet and, in particular, on social media have seemed to shift considerably. Not only has the World Wide Web not democratized authoritarian states, but it’s arguably made them stronger. China, for instance, has utilized tech and algorisms to setup a mass surveillance apparatus along with its dystopian social credit system. Even liberal democracies like the United States, through institutions like the NSA, have set up surveillance frameworks, though still not to the tarrying extent of its Eastern rival. Furthermore, cyberspace has become the latest front in warfare. Similar to how nations used to hire privateers to target rival countries’ ships, states now utilize private individuals to sabotage each other through increasingly disruptive cyber-attacks. The internet, particularly the so-called Dark Web, has also become a distribution network for illicit material such as drugs and child pornography. And, as mentioned earlier, there is increased concern over the mental and societal effects social media has on the populace, especially children and adolescents. Perhaps the major catalyst for this shift in perception came after the 2016 election. This was after Donald Trump’s shocking victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. It was after this electoral upset that social media companies began to take a more proactive approach to monitoring what they deemed as misinformation based on the assumption that foreign, online propaganda propelled Trump to the White House. In reality, poorly worded posts by Russians with relatively small engagements most likely did very little to skew the election in Trump’s favor. You could perhaps argue that message boards like 4chan had some impact, but the notion that young men spamming memes of frogs was the decisive edge the Trump campaign needed is a bit farfetched. Nevertheless, there came increased pressure to crackdown on misinformation. In response to this pressure, social media companies took various measures. Facebook, for example, decided to utilize third party fact checkers, such as Media Matters and PolitiFact, essentially outsourcing their monitoring process. The issue with many of these fact checkers is that they generally have a left-wing bias. I will get into this in more depth a little later, but often these fact checkers would flag articles that were true, but label them false because they were “missing context” or their “tone.” This incredibly broad standard meant that pretty much any political or somewhat controversial post could theoretically be flagged if phrased in slightly the wrong way. Around late 2016 and early 2017, you began to see YouTube, which is Google owned, take a much harder line as well. YouTube’s process was slightly different from Facebook’s in the sense that their crackdowns weren’t just designed to censor what they deemed to be misleading information. It was also censoring content the video sharing service viewed as harassment or bullying. This caused many of the edgier YouTubers to have their videos deranked, demonized, or have their accounts outright removed. By 2019, things escalated when Facebook decided to permanently bar certain controversial individuals, including Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer and Luis Farrakhan, all of whom are right-wing commentators minus Farrakhan. Although many of the people certainty have espoused some repugnant views, what was interesting about the bans is that it was done under the vague Facebook policy that was intended to stop “dangerous individuals and organizations.” Twitter did the same, banning Alex Jones and Gavin McInnis for reasons that still remain unclear. The problem is that you can think the names listed above are awful individuals; but none, as far as I am aware, have ever directly called for violence. Moreover, there was the question of why other provocative voices, practically those on the left who have called for radical action, were not de-platformed as well. However, the more significant issue here is not who was banned. Indeed, I believe many people from all sides of the aisle would agree that those expelled have opinions that are rather objectionable.  The greater concern is that a precedent had been set to banish those who were deemed unworthy of being heard. The same is true of certain Facebook pages owned by particular groups. From 2016 on, Facebook had begun banning certain profiles from particular organizations. At first, these were mostly nationalist, far right, and white supremacist groups. However, this quickly expanded to other political societies as well. For instance, at the end of 2018, Facebook removed the pages of 800 accounts under the vague standard of “coordinated inauthentic behavior”. When the company was pressed on this, their claim was that much of it had to do with multiple accounts spreading spam. This didn’t make much sense, as all political groups on Facebook send out political ads. In fact, all companies and other non-partisan pages do as well. As with de-platforming individuals, a censorship model was now established. Thus, the groundwork was laid for a social media censorship regime. However, it was not until the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic that it went into absolute overdrive. This was the point where the contention really took hold amongst the largest social media platforms that, due to the public health emergency, information needed to be heavily scrutinized and filtered. In other words, social media outlets would try to present what were the opinions of the consensus. Before I get into specific examples, there are numerous issues with this line of thinking. First is the fact that there never was a “consensus.” Experts have disagreed on what the correct policies should be from the get-go. For instance, Dr. Marty Makary from Johns Hopkins and Dr. Scott Atlas, part of President Trump’s White House COVID advisory team, have consistently been at odds with the Fauci’s and many of CDC’s recommendations. Moreover, there has been disagreements among the authorities. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC, for example, have been at odds over when a third booster is required or needed. Speaking of the WHO, there is also the fact that the “science” has consistently changed during this pandemic. Take YouTube, which originally tailored its policy to only allow content that corresponded with the WHO. The problem is, early on, the WHO contended that COVID was not transmissible between humans. Now, perhaps this can be forgiven, as the Chinese government was the entity that initially spread this lie. However, as I discussed above, the public health establishment’s messaging on the pandemic has been all over the place and has not corresponded with changes in the science. In fact, as demonstrated earlier, politics undoubtedly played a role in public health apparatus’s dictates. There is also the issue of what happens when you ban people with certain perspectives. First, it lends legitimacy to what the banned person was saying. With regards to COVID, if you de-platform someone for arguing that the vaccines are bad, it only lends credence to the beliefs held by many vaccine-hesitant individuals that there is an ulterior motive. “What is it they are hiding from us? What don’t they want us to know?” For if you look at it from the perspective of someone questioning the vaccine’s efficacy—why would an institution so confident in their position that the vaccine works, need to suppress the other side, rather than just present its argument? Furthermore, you will often times have what is referred to as the ‘Barbara Streisand’, aptly named after the time a photographer captured aerial pictures of Streisand’s Malibu home. This caused an enraged Streisand to sue the photographer in order to prevent the photos’ distribution. The problem was that by suing, Streisand actually brought mass attention to these pictures, which otherwise would have been largely glossed over or ignored completely. This is what happened when Twitter and YouTube censored Dr. Robert Malone, a topic I’ll get to later. The final concern is open expression and the unhindered dissemination of information. I realize that tech companies are private platforms. Hence, they are not bound by the First Amendment’s free speech requirements. Nonetheless, as discussed previously, these platforms have become not only society’s chief means for spreading and consuming information, but doing business, establishing and maintaining connections, both for personal and work-related reasons.  This means that if a certain group or individual’s voice is suppressed, whether partially or completely, it puts the silenced at a major disadvantage. This is especially true if companies were to embrace a particular partisan or consensus viewpoint, as those who held beliefs outside the tech, ‘mainstream’ oligopoly could be inhibited. There may be those that argue that this a good thing. However, consider how many times throughout history that the consensus has been wrong. It was once the consensus, for instance, that the Sun revolved around the Earth, that scientific racism and Social Darwinism were legitimate, and that the 1992, U. S. government’s Food Pyramid was the best way to achieve a healthy diet. As Christopher Hitchens used to say, “Don't take security in the false refuge of consensus.” More importantly, because these tech giants influence so much of politics, society, and economics, their censorious behavior can affect the culture of free speech. This is crucial because cultural norms will eventually shape not only how we see ourselves in the world, but also the law. There was a point in this country in which there existed, particularly on the American left, a skepticism towards corporations and their ability to dictate the political, economic, and societal rules of the game to decide what you can and cannot see. Now, as social media has become the driving force in almost all spheres of American life, you now are a select and small cadre of people who are able to do just that. So, how did the COVID pandemic accelerate and proliferate the social media censorship apparatus? It started with lockdowns. As mentioned above, around April, 2020, anti-lockdown protests began to spring up. It was around this time that Facebook announced a policy that it would ban users from organizing “events that defy government’s guidance on social distancing.” In other words, they would suppress the users’ ability to organize protests. However, as with our public health officials, Facebook moderators did not hold to this policy once the BLM protests and riots and broke out. Facebook also clamped down on discussions of the virus’s origin, specifically dialog concerning the lab leak theory. From very early on in this Pandemic, there were questions arising over the virus’s source. Although there was no hard evidence this was the case, there was quite a bit circumstantial to support this contention. For instance, the fact that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was experimenting with these same coronaviruses, that there had been concern in U.S. intelligence cables about the lab’s safety procedures, the bizarre nature of the virus, and the Chinese government’s odd behavior when others looked into the matter, etc.. However, Facebook did not allow such deliberations on its platform—that is until May of 2021. There is then the issue on masks. As mentioned previously, Dr. Fauci’s early position on masks was that they were not needed. They soon became not only encouraged, but debates about their efficacy soon morphed into a partisan issue. Social media took the pro-mask line and enforced its biddings. For instance, in October of 2020, Twitter removed a tweet from Dr. Scott Atlas, who was part of Trump’s COVID task force, questioning the usefulness of masks. However, most disturbing would be what occurred in April of 2021. This is when Google removed a YouTube video containing a roundtable discussion between Dr. Atlas and other public health experts, along with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. This was because many of these group members believed children should not be forced to wear face masks. As referred to above, the study which was relied upon to support masking in schools was extremely problematic. Moreover, because the COVID mortality rate for children, particularly those with no preexisting conditions is so low, and the role that seeing faces plays in a child’s development, created serious questions over whether masking children may cause more harm than good (Dr. Marty Makary wrote an interesting article on this). Nevertheless, YouTube deleted the video because it “contradicted the consensus of local and global health authorities.” Google’s actions here were troubling for another reason, though. They had censored a government official, a high ranking one at that. This dystopian trend would continue when Senator Rand Paul’s YouTube channel was suspended for a week for questioning the effectiveness of cloth masks to stop the delta variant due to the mutation’s much heavier viral load. What’s interesting here is that a few days after this, Zeke Emanuel, who is on President Biden’s COVID team, said almost exactly the same thing. Facebook employed the same tactics through its independent fact checkers. When John Tierney wrote an article on children masking citing a German study that passed peer review by Monthly Pediatrics, Facebook swiftly flagged his post as “partially false information.” The fact checker in this regard was a group called Health Feedback, which oddly enough, once labelled a claim by President Trump as ‘inaccurate’,  when he claimed that the development of a COVID vaccine was imminent, since one would likely not be available until mid-2021. This brings us to the vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines have become quite the hot-button issue. As discussed previously, the topic of vaccines has become politically contentious, especially with regards to mandates, vaccine passports, etc. Even debates regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines have not been immune (pun intended) from political posturing. For instance, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Andrew Cuomo, all now major proponents of the vaccine, previously suggested that they would be hesitant to trust a vaccine developed under the Trump Administration. These statements were of course made prior to Biden and Harris taking office. There is even leaked video of Matt Zuckerberg from 2020 expressing skepticism over the mRNA vaccines and the possible, harmful effects they can have on human DNA and RNA. However, whatever was the previous conventional wisdom on vaccines, quickly shifted during late 2020/early 2021. The conventional wisdom became that the only way out of this pandemic was vaccination. I’m not here to argue the wisdom of such a contention. What’s important to this discussion is how social media mirrored this notion, censoring any information it perceived as contradictory or undermining what they believed was the consensus. For example, during the later part of 2021, Facebook and Instagram blocked any posts with the hashtag #NaturalImmunity. This was an effort by individuals on social media to spread awareness that those who had previously been infected with COVID-19, did not need the vaccine—a proposition which flew in the face of CDC recommendations. What’s interesting about this incident is that the “natural immunity” community was not completely without merit. Not only has natural immunity been a well-established phenomenon, but an Israeli study published during the later part of 2021, actually showed that natural immunity was probably more durable and long-lasting than vaccine immunity. In fact, as I write this article, the CDC now admits that natural immunity was six times stronger during the Delta wave than vaccination. I’m not trying to make a recommendation of whether or not someone should get vaccinated based on a prior COVID infection. What I am saying is that Facebook censorship policy did not, dare I say, follow the science. This is also true in regards to their fact checkers. I can actually cite two examples of this that I personally witnessed. The first time was January 1, 2021,, when someone reposted a Clay Travis tweet, commenting on the 95% or higher vaccination rates for NFL, NBA and NFL players, but noted that COVID cases were still skyrocketing. This was accompanied by the fact check, “Missing Context, the ‘shot is not failing—it prevents most infections and reduces symptoms of breakthrough infections’.” In terms of the latter comment, it is probably true that the vaccines reduced symptoms. However, even the CDC now admits that the vaccines were not preventing infections, particularly with the Omicron variant. My second example was when someone posted a quote from Dr. Robert Malone, which read, “First time in history that the ineffectiveness of a medicine is being blamed on those who haven’t taken it.” The fact check here was rather intriguing, as it read “Fact Check: A vaccinated person is not wrong to think an unvaccinated person is a threat to their health.” In regards to COVID-19, this is absolutely false. First, even by CDC standards, a vaccinated person who is exposed to someone infected does not need to isolate (although the recommendation was recently added that the exposed wear a mask for a few days). Second, the CDC now admits that both the vaccinated and unvaccinated can spread the disease. Thus, if you’re vaccinated, an unvaccinated person is not a threat to you. Speaking of Dr. Malone, a man who played a key role in the development of mRNA, his appearance on the “Joe Rogan Experience” caused serious consternation, along with Dr. Peter McCullough. Even before the outrage mob descended upon Rogan, YouTube removed excerpts from the interviews with these two doctors. It should be noted that both Malone and McCullough are vaccinated, but had their videos removed due to questioning COVID orthodoxy. Twitter would later ban Dr. Malone as well. This is not to say everything they said on Rogan’s podcast wasn’t datable. However, as mentioned multiple time earlier, even experts who are viewed as being part of the consensus have been wrong in their assessments. What’s most troubling is this suppression that is being utilized against elected officials. Recently, Representative Marjorie Taylor Green was permanently banned by Twitter for misinformation. Representative Green has made some rather peculiar comments in the past. Nevertheless, this ban was strange as it was based on “misleading” information, something which is common practice on Twitter (and mainstream media outlets in general). One specific tweet she was banned for was her posting of a chart from the government’s Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting System (VAERS) and claiming there were “extremely high amounts of COVID vaccine deaths.” Now, it is true that her words probably misinterpreted the data. However, if that’s so, every politician should be banned from Twitter, as that’s been a common practice, since statistics became part of politics. Another post where she earned a strike was when she claimed COVID was not dangerous unless one was obese or over the age of 65. What’s interesting about this assertion is that it’s not entirely off-base. According to the study Unusually High Risks of COVID-19 Mortality with Age-Related Comorbidities…, 92.8% of COVID-19 deaths were associated with a pre-existing comorbidity. Indeed, we’ve known for awhile that age and weight are major factors in regards to determining risk. This is not to say that Representative Green was 100% correct in her statement, as she was clearly engaging in hyperbole. The issue is that pretty much every single American politician engages in this behavior. And this brings me to the more significant point, and that is how social media censorship of COVID misinformation quickly evolved into wider ranging suppression, which was not only more disconcerting, but had more, far-reaching effects. This is particularly true in regards to the last election. Facebook third party fact checkers began to flag and remove political advertisements. Unfortunately, this mostly targeted ads that were more right of center. For instance, an ad from the America First Pac, a super pac for former President Donald Trump, claimed that Joe Biden would raise taxes. PolitiFact flagged it with a “mostly false” rating, despite it directly quoting Joe Biden during the campaign. Facebook then removed the ad, based on PolitiFact’s claim that the advertisement did not give enough “context” to what Biden said. But removing political ads pales in comparison to Twitter’s and Facebook’s direct interference in the 2020 Presidential Election. This occurred when Twitter and Facebook didn’t allow the sharing or distribution of the New York Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story—a news report that was completely true. Whether or not this ultimately affected the actual outcome of the election is unknown. However, considering how many people get their information from social media, such actions were quite perturbing. To put it into perspective, private, mega-corporations who control a significant portion of the information flow interfered in the 2020 elections substantially more than the Russians did back in 2016. You don’t have to like Donald Trump to understand the disturbing nature of these unprecedented measures. This was in a strange way almost a precursor to what would occur next when, following the January 6, 2021 riots, Trump was banned from essentially all social media platforms. This was followed by a quick purge of numerous individual accounts that seemingly pushed Trump’s narrative that the election was stolen. Again, regardless of what you think about Trump or his behavior following the election, a sitting president being banned from all social media outlets, the primary purveyors of information, would be akin to FDR being banned from the Radio or Reagan from the television. This was why world leaders, from Germany’s Angela Merkel to Mexico’s Obrador, neither huge fans of the former U. S. President, came out so strongly against the platforms’ decision. The purges even found their way to conservative platforms. Parler, which branded itself as the “free speech” rival to Twitter, was expelled from Amazon’s servers and taken down. The stated reason for this was that Parler was the primary instrument for organizing the storming of the U. S. Capitol building. This actually turned out to be false, as, interestingly enough, this stampede was almost exclusively coordinated on Facebook. This brings me the principle point I want to emphasize. As I alluded to earlier, much of the social media apparatus is managed and maintained by individuals with leftwing world views far outside lockstep with the average American. However, this is only part of the story. One of the more alarming trends regarding social media censorship is how the government is utilizing its regulatory powers to further the censorship regime. This the reason why Facebook has been in the news relatively recently, along with its representatives, having to testify in front of Congress on what seems like multiple occasions. Democrats are essentially threatening tech companies to censor information they don’t like, lest the corporations get investigated for say anti-trust violation (Glenn Greenwald wrote an excellent piece on this). You’ve seen government officials, for instance, blame Facebook and other outlets for COVID policy failures, such as Jen Psaki calling on Facebook to censor disinformation or Spotify to do the same with Rogan, or Joe Biden’s eloquent phrasing, when he commented that Facebook was “killing people.” It doesn’t help that these politicians’ media allies have been all too eager to lend their support to certain measures. This is because legacy media outlets wish to reestablish their informational monopoly, which was significantly curtailed due to the proliferation of competing outlets that gained prominence online. This is disquieting, as the federal government is essentially trying to find a backdoor to limit and control speech on the largest information purveyors in human history, where a massive amount of discourse is conducted. Moreover, though these companies may share many views with certain Democratic politicians, it’s not unreasonable to believe that Republicans will do this right back to Democrats. If the Republicans were to take back both Congressional Houses this year, which seems likely by current polling, and the presidency in 2024, it’s not unreasonable to think the GOP could threaten social media companies like their rivals. Hence, a terrible precedent would be established in which the party in power can use its authority to monitor and control the conservations and content on these platforms. I’ll finish by saying that the way social media has impacted our era will probably not be fully understood for decades, perhaps even centuries to come. It has shifted our society and politics in many fundamental ways that even most “experts” have trouble articulating where it’s all going. It has certainly played a role in polarizing us, as people with extreme or insane views can put their messages out there, find likeminded individuals, and attempt to shift the so-called Overton window. They can hide behind screens, attacking people anonymously like they old style mobs carrying out vigilante justice (“Cancel Culture”). However, these are just some of many issues arising from social media. What is of little doubt is that the COVID-19 pandemic certainly expanded and hasted these matters. How will all this end? If I’m being honest, it’s way beyond my intellectual capacities. What I will say is I don’t believe this status quo is sustainable. For one thing, it goes against American fundamental ideology regarding openness and free expression. But possibly even more importantly, backlash social media’s effects is already underway. Due to the mass isolation during lockdown, many people, especially the youth, tried to maintain social connection through their phones. The problem is relationships through a screen cannot replace face-to-face interpersonal interactions. Loneliness can’t be fully alleviated by Instagram, Facebook, Zoom, TikTok or online video games. This is why it will be interesting to see how children in this upcoming generation (Gen Alpha), who were forced to attend Zoom classes and were unable to see their peers, interact when they reach adolescence. Perhaps they will be used so used to cyber interface that they will become more even enmeshed in it. Alternatively, their longing for real, personal relationships may mean that they largely discard technological devices, thereby becoming one of the most, dare I say, “social” generations since prior to the World Wide Web establishment. But whatever happens, it will certainly be fascinating to watch it all unfold. Conclusion The COVID-19 Pandemic will undoubtedly go down as one of the twenty-first century’s most consequential events. This is not only because of the millions it left dead, but its multitude of ancillary impacts. What was discussed above are only a few of the ways this virus accelerated already present trends. Other includes the hastening of work-from-home life, which was already underway thanks to the expansion and growth of high-speed internet. The debt crisis, which has been occurring for decades and used as a means to maintain the standard of living since 2008 financial, has proliferated to unimaginable levels. The United States by itself has spent more revenue than at any point in the history of mankind. The increase in distrust for the media that was already occurring hit overdrive, largely due to the press’s own malfeasance. The explosion of the mental health crisis. In 2019, one-third of males and one-half of females expressed some sort of mental distress. This has expanded significantly due to the Pandemic. Children’s use of social media rather than person-to-person connectively, as numerous children were isolated from friends and schoolmates. This may expand further with the formation of new online ecosystems like the Meta Verse. The death of privacy—something that was already occurring due to social media, but now seems to have been more readily accept, even with regards to health information (think vaccine passports). There are probably numerous other ways the COVID outbreak exacerbated and hastened underlying t issues. The truth is that we probably won’t know the true ramifications until decades, or perhaps even centuries, have passed. So, if you’re someone reading this article in the near or distant, I’m sure you’re naturally judging what I did and what I didn’t get correct. Yet, please bear in mind that it’s not always easy to make such analysis in the present day. For, dare I say, hindsight is always 2020 (pun intended). © 2022 RMS Thornton"
16,"Indonesian Heroine, Kartini and Woman Emancipation in Java Tradition",politics," Yohan12 holds a bachelor's degree in Islamic guidance & counseling, master's degree in education and Doctor Cand. in Islamic Studies The IDR 5 banknote, printed in 1952 with Raden Ajeng Kartini's image Wikimedia In the Dutch’s colonial era, women got difficulty to participate freely in public places due to the restriction of an old tradition. At that time women did not have any authorities like men. So they just spent most of their youth lives at home seclusion. As an indigenous woman like R.A. (Raden Adjeng) Kartini, such restriction actually became a trigger to make significant changes. She fought tenaciously against all the confinements to free women from adversity. Suffering from bitterness of life, then she's inspired to raise women's rights and finally succeeded in the establishment of a special school for girls named the 'Kartini School'. R.A. Kartini was a daughter of Adipati Ario Sosroningrat (one of the descendants of Hamengkubuwono VI) who was appointed by the Dutch government as a district Regent of Jepara in Central Java. Unfortunately, the Dutch Government in Java at that time required her father to marry a noble women before he was appointed as a regent. Practically, her father had three wives, they were M.A. Ngasirah (Kartini’s biological mother) as the first wife from an ordinary woman, Raden Adjeng Woerjan as a noble woman from Madura kingdom in East Java and another one who was named unmentioned. Besides, she had 11 biological as well as step brothers and sisters. She's born from a Javanese noble family in April 21, 1879 in Mayong, Jepara, Central Java province. Although her father had high political position but she didn't get a larger opportunity to participate in public domains. Nevertheless, she's permitted to study at ELS (Europese Lagere School) in Java, a school managed by the Dutch government, up to 12 years old. Unfortunately, in her 12 up to 16 in 1895, she'd to be secluded at home by her family. Like many other girls, Kartini was also forbidden to have massive outdoor activities. After she got her freedom in her 16, six months later she's locked up again. Then after her six months seclusion, she got her freedom and officially permitted to have outdoor activities. Unfortunately, she got a lot of reproaches from her community due to her unusual thoughts that against the establishment of old traditions. At that time she realized that Javanese girls were very different from European's. They're also very much different from men in the term of social status. At that time, a girl’s fate was dominantly determined by her parents. For example, In marital status, a girl had to marry a man that she hadn't recognized before and obeyed her parents' choices, matchmaking alike. That's one of the traditions that extremely impressed her. Marrying an ideal man was just a wishful dream for girls in Java at that traditional confining time. In short, Kartini's had to spend her young age in very traditional community in central Java that applied strict rules. Indonesian Heroine: Raden Adjeng Kartini Wikimedia One day, Kartini met one of young female students who was studying French language in preparation for going to school in Netherlands. Then she asked her: ""Kartini, what major would you choose after finishing your study in Java?"" At that time she couldn't give any answers to that question. She’s really confused. Even she never knew what she wanted to be. Her friend's question above really made an impressive memory to her mind for years. After that ,she felt very lonely because her female friends had already continued their studies in Netherlands. She realized one day she would be left behind. Indeed, she also had high dream to study in Europe, but unfortunately her dream never came true. Fortunately, at that time she's still allowed by her family to read books, magazines and newspapers in Dutch language. At that time she realized that although she couldn't study to higher levels but there's still a lot of opportunities to learn and achieve many things in various ways. For example, every time she finished doing female works at home, she immediately read many books to free her loneliness, for example, read books written by Louis Copeeruus (De Stille Kracht), Van Eden, Auguste de Witt, and Multatuli (Max Havelaar and Love Letters), and other feminism romances. In addition, she actively did correspondences to her friends who were studying in European countries. At least it could comfort her mind who was in isolation with her older sister in the midst of her family life. After the death of Kartini in 1904, her correspondence entitled 'After darkness comes the light containing social critics and her lawsuit against the restrictive tradition of women in Java to be published in the Netherlands by Mr. Jacques Abendanon in 1911. Note: Kartini’s correspondence was frequently considered controversial because there's an interference by the Dutch East Indies government as indicated by some people. Self-loneliness was increasingly felt by Kartini while her mother began to regularly stay away. Fortunately, although at that time women were positioned lower than men, one of her brothers and her father still loved and cared for her well. In her era, girls’ status were quite different from boys. They weren't freely permitted to study in some schools held by Dutch government. They're only permitted to learn at home or at traditional schools. R.A. Kartini for elevating women's social-political rights: after rain comes sunshine and after darkness comes the light. Wikimedia As one of indigenous women, Kartini came courageously to fight for the restrained conditions that were less favorable for women between two opposite choices both how to elevate women's social-political rights and a strong urge to free women from traditional shackles. Unfortunately, what kind of the best alternative that she had to take, everything was still completely dark in the range of her mind. Her strange behavior seemed unpleasant to some people in her community. They frequently ridiculed and laughed at her. She actually wanted to share such conditions with her father but she couldn’t because she worried about violating Javanese restrictive customs. When she talked much at that time, it would make her even more isolated. Then, she realized that her father’s political power as a regent was not necessarily able to boost her ambitions. Political power of an indigenous was sometimes far from hope. Then she thought that only sincerity with the strength of self-determination would finally work to produce her best achievements. R.A. Kartini's Letter Wikimedia After all of her older sisters and brothers were married, then Kartini became the eldest unmarried woman in her family. At that time, she abolished one of old traditions that demeaned humans by prohibiting her younger siblings from bowing every time they met. In 1902, Mr. Van Kol and Mrs. Nelli, the two important people from Netherlands, encouraged her to study in Netherlands. But in contradictory, in 1903, she was also suggested by Mr. Jacques Abendanon in order to not study in that country because it would harm her due to the traditional rules. Then, she's delegated by Mr. Jacques Abendon (The Dutch Minister of Religion, Arts and Culture in Indonesia) to study in a teacher school in Batavia, now it's Jakarta. After her graduation, she and her younger sister named Kardinah and assisted by several other friends were able to establish a female school. The popular motto of Kartini is 'after rain comes sunshine' or ‘after darkness comes the light.’ That school was finally established and named the Kartini School in the city of Rembang, Central Java. In this school, female students were taught skills in Dutch and Javanese languages, Art, Arithmetic, Geography, History, and various practical skills of everyday life. That's the first female school established by an indigenous woman in Java. Kartini's success in establishing a school for girls was one of her greatest achievements during her lifetime, as the initial milestone of enlightenment for Indonesian women in the future. A few months later in 1903, she received an offer to continue her studies in Netherlands but she refused because she was required by her parents to get married. Then, in September 4 in 1904, she gave birth to a baby boy. Unfortunately, several days after giving birth, in September 17, 1904, Kartini finally died. She died in the very young age, at about 25, in Bulu village, Rembang district, Central Java. And today, her dreams and words inspire many Indonesian women to strive for justice and equality. Then, the management of the female school that she built prior to her death was continued by her younger sister and other friends. Signature of Raden Adjeng Kartini Wikimedia Some important things to take into account from the struggle of R.A. Kartini wasn't because of the place where she studied but her positive roles in educating and raising women’s consciousness on social status. Besides, she's highly respected by many Indonesian people due to her courageous in: To thank her long efforts in raising women’s consciousness to make them free form the confinement of an old tradition, then Indonesian government makes a special day for her as a national holiday in every 21 of April, to annually recall all of her struggles for women emancipation. Raden Ajeng Kartini for women's emancipation Wikimedia That’s a short life history of R.A Kartini. Despite all the controversies as indicated by some people to the interference of the Dutch East Indies government to her struggle in defying Javanese old traditions, but her achievement for elevating women's social-political rights is worth to remember for today's as well as future generations. Then, the government of the first President issued a Presidential Decree of the Republic of Indonesia dated May 2, No. 108 of 1964, which appointed her as a National Heroine which became known as 'Kartini Day' as a fighter for emancipating women's status. Hopefully this story can be a warm inspiration for girls and women in today's modern era to do better contributions for their countries. https://setkab.go.id/adakah-generasi-penerus-r-a-kartini https://lsis.fmipa.ugm.ac.id/artikel-tentang-r-a-kartini https://patikab.go.id/v2/id/2015/04/20/hari-kartini--sejarahnya http://ditpsd.kemdikbud.go.id/artikel/detail/7-inspirasi-semangat-ibu-kartini Armijn Pane (pen.), (2009).

17,Is America Ready for a Female President?,politics," Ignore the in-my-face obvious issues and lend all of my attention to unwarranted, groundless non-issues?

Not happening! On one hand, I believe there are many powerful women who are perfectly capable of handling the duties, as the President of the United States of America! Their heads are on straight, their hearts are in the right place and they understand what it means to lead, to make tough choices and they can manage and run a business, with the best of them {aka: men}. They understand the urgency in protecting and defending the U.S. Constitution, at all costs! These women are well-informed, aren't easily swayed by the latest trends and woke... isn't in their vocabulary, which brings me to the other hand... We started off strong, as suffragettes, we persisted and fought for the right to vote, but then it went downhill from there. We got the vote, hallelujah, but our next big fight, was as feminists, not as suffragettes We went from being advocates for the female species, wanting equality and equal opportunity, straight into warrior-mode, put on earth to put down, insult and defeat males {aka: men} and it has royally kicked us in the butt ever since! Once feminists made it clear that they wished to do battle with men, not join them; they failed us - Once feminists turned our wombs, into a battleground, they failed us! Suffragettes America's Library Here in the U.S.A., women march, in droves, every year (thank you God those numbers are beginning to dwindle) I digress... women march, in droves, every year, taking a stand for and making the case for, abortion: in how many stages of development in how many different ways and how often can they end the life of a new creation in the womb! Please hear me out... Feminists did this! When I think back to the 70's, when I was a teenager, we were told that babies weren't really babies until they were born and drew their first breath As if there was no developmental stages whatsoever, they just suddenly appeared as babies with their ten little fingers and ten little toes. We were told they were only clumps of cells...up until they were screaming their lungs out, outside of the womb As a result, many young women aborted their babies; listening to the professionals {listening to the Science, one might say} that never steers us wrong, right? It was at this point that abortion became birth control for many! Conscience, consideration and consequence were out the window, because girls/women had received the blessing of their Government, via the passing of Roe v. Wade. Today, we have no idea of the number of women haunted by this decision. Nor the number of men haunted as well, slighted, whether in the name of ignorance or callousness. Not only has tossing conscience, consideration and consequence aside, led to many abortions, in many cases, a getting even in a relationship, has been the cause. This is so petty to me, perhaps even worse than the other selfish reasons why a young life, is snuffed out. On top of petty and vindictive behavior, I am told that women are pushing left of center agendas to the forefront, when considering their vote. I am told that women are the ones putting socialists into office. If it weren't for women getting the vote, Trump wouldn't have been sent packing, bringing in the inept, establishment-type Biden...or so we have repeatedly been told! I have a big problem with far left of center and socialists agendas. They do not benefit this Country in the least, they do not benefit a single soul, certainly not our most precious commodity, our children! They only do more harm. Women were all in for Hillary Clinton, and yet I never, personally, heard one woman make the case for Hillary - I have never heard one good explanation as to why she, above all others, would make a good President. What have I heard? Because, ""women are due"". Because ""Hillary has paid her dues"". Are we due? Have we proven ourselves? What have we learned about Mrs. Clinton, post 2016 election: She set up her competition, a man, Donald Trump, to lose She was behind the bogus, Trump and Russian collusion claims Mrs. Clinton birthed it and fed it and as a result of her lies, the entire direction of this Nation was altered, in a destructive way Let us consider some of the latest cutting edge, woke, politics, shall we: When Candidate Hillary Clinton wasn't conniving to steal an election, she was out referring to half of the Nation {including women} as ""deplorable"". Donald Trump wasn't dismissing the other half, registered Democratic voters, he was reaching out to them and winning many over. But, because of her - no where near ready for prime time, antics: Because of her lies- the entire course of this Nation was rerouted, causing such angst, division and destruction! Half the Nation was convinced to distrust a man, based on her lies, before he even had a chance to prove himself! Have we learned anything ladies? The newest member of the Supreme Court, a woman, selected because she is a woman, was unable to define the word ""woman"" and for that, she has been embraced, a real hero to some. Not because she is a woman, but because she fits a certain mold and is woke enough! While the newest member of the Supreme Court is stuttering and stammering about the definition of woman; men, who have failed as men, are choosing to become women and in the process, they are defeating women in sports. Such great strides, reduced to females trying to beat stronger, more massive and muscular males...to the finish line. Today's way off target, with the potential to destroy children's lives before they really start, leftist agendas, have taken over and destroyed any good work ever done by the suffragettes! Are we ready? © 2022 A B Williams"
18,Effects of Climate Change on Our Society and Remedial Measures,politics," Being known worldwide as the “Crisis of our Time”, climate change is the debate of the century globally. Worldwide, studies are being carried out to know what is climate change and how to tackle its worsening effects on our atmosphere as well as our lifestyles. There are worldwide protests to pressurize people at the helm of affairs to take concrete actions against the devastating effects of Climate change. Earth’s atmosphere has been subject to constant change since its inception, there have been marked fluctuations in overall temperatures worldwide when we map our planet’s climatic behavior since its beginning, in the temporal domain. At present, global warming is happening at the fastest speed; thanks to humanity’s modernization process. Climate change includes increased temperatures, severe weather conditions, mounting sea levels, ever-changing wildlife populations and habitats, and a variety of other influences. Simply the main reason behind climate change is the “Human Activity”. Massive “greenhouse emissions” are being released into the earth’s atmosphere due to burning fossil fuels to power our modern lives, population explosion, methane produced from animals, refrigerant gases, etc. Greenhouse gases are at their peak intensities during the past 8 centuries which is altering our climate at ever faster rates than before. When all the above-mentioned greenhouse emissions are released in the air vs when the sunlight gets into the earth’s atmosphere – some of the heat gets trapped and resultantly, the planet gets warmer causing the “Greenhouse Effect”. UN says it is ok if the earth warms by 1.5-2 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century. However, quite alarmingly, we are on track to hit 1.5 degrees in only a matter of just 10 years. Therefore, if we don’t slow the process down, we are about to hit worldwide catastrophes quite soon. Climate change causes adverse effects on oceans, weather, food, and our health as follows:-   As human beings are the prime reason for devastating climate change; it is only humans who can fix the problem. Some of the measures to cap the issue are as under:- As we move close to the first quarter of the 21st century, our chance to avoid worse climate change slowly escapes us. We cannot afford complacency in the face of climate chaos. We have the solutions available; all we need to do is to turn our dreams into reality by honest collective resolve for a better tomorrow.

19,"You Are Using The Phrase ""Non-Binary"" Incorrectly.",politics," Caston George is a 10-year veteran political professional and former politician, accomplished writer, researcher, author, and archivist. ""Non-Binary"" does not mean what you think it does. If you got a tattoo that you thought said ""warrior"" in Japanese characters, but, um, did not actually say that, you would want someone to tell you, right? Please stop using the phrase ""non-binary"" to describe yourself. It is incorrect.That it begins with “Non-” means that you are describing yourself in a way that indicates that you do not exist; you are describing that which you are not, not the thing what you wish to describe as BEING that thing, which is still not yet named, but whatever it is is that which you are not.You are describing yourself as not that thing over there (and incorrectly), instead of what you are! In twelve easy steps, we can accurately describe what you are, if you are generally the sort of person who would otherwise, and incorrectly, describe yourself as ""non-binary""! 1) Is not a binary that you are trying to differentiate yourself from, it is properly a dichotomy, taken in and of itself, but as this appertains to relationships (inter or intra of that dichotomy), it is therefore actually a polarity, the polarity between men and women. It is not a binary because a binary is a consistency of a unit comprised of two, ie, if you have two parents, you are a binary, and that is immutable, and; 2) There are over a dozen words in your Latin-based English that denote the concept of two, including duo, bi, di (like divide, dichotomy, distinct), alterna, secundus, dual, duel (implies at least two would be duelling), twix (that is why there are two candybars), ""twi-"" generally (like twilight, ""between the lights of the day, the Sun, and of the night, the Moon,"" is the border between the night time and the day time); In addition to these, diurnal describes day and sunny things btw; also, twain (yes it is so that the twin shall ever meet!), tween (BE-Tween begins with ""BE!"" not, ""Non-tween"", because that would be as stupid as ""non-binary""), below (implies that there is something above it, still begins with be- correctly saying that there is something else there; ""as the above commands, so that which is below accords""); also: super/inferior and supra/infra (both indicate at least one other which they are distinct from, and you generally use one only in relationship to or with relation with the other), aut, pair, twosome, team; and of course COUPLE; and &c. We are using very different words with important significations to them, that were instituted for good enough reasons that required there to be different words to signify the differences and distinctions, indicating that these specific nuances, are very important; and; 3) You are TRYING to say you are, conceptually and properly speaking, either: SANS POLAR or TRANS POLAR; ""Non-Dichotomous"" would not work to describe yourself because although the male-female dichotomy is something you are independent from, it still does not describe what you are, and also, it does not work because it still begns with ""non-"". 3a) Both SANS POLAR and TRANS POLAR (and others), however, do work, and which are you are hinges and depends upon your personal individual life experience, because SANS POLAR describes (much like the sans family of typeface hasn't the need for the frills of the serif) YOU EXIST BEYOND THE NEED FOR THE MALE-FEMALE POLARITY, and therefore, the need for the relationships that men and women have with one another ; and TRANS POLAR describes someone who has transitioned or traversed or travelled from one pole to the other pole at least once, so it will be different depending upon you as an individual self, as one size does not fit all, necessarily, exempt from this however is ""non"" because; 4) WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE ""NON-BINARY"", YOU ARE SAYING YOU DO NOT EXIST BY BEGINNING IT WITH ""NON""; you are starting with nothing, a black hole, and saying, ""I am not that which is a binary,"" even though you are a binary. You are not describing you, you are describing what you are not, and incorrectly, and; 4a) If you are non-binary, are you therefore then a unary? Answer: No, because you are not a single-cell organism (or Jesus Christ, alternatively, though it could be argued that he was transcendental, and a demigod, at the very least, and therefore, had three parents, technically he is a trinity, or for common people, a ternary); 4b) If you are non-binary and non-unary, does that mean you are a ternary? Or a Tertiary? Answer: No, because unless a demigod, that would indicate you are a party of three. 4c) What about a quarternary or a tetrary? Answer: No, because that would mean you are a party of four, and at that point, your table might be ready, follow me and your waiter will be right with you...... 5) Binary describes quantity, not relationship. 6) Polarity describes relationships, not quantity, and therefore; 7) You are actually saying, to follow ""non-binary"" stupid-people logic, that not only do you not exist, and more over are definitely not the binary you actually are by default of existence (personal identity or social relationships nonwithstanding), that there are only two other options you are esentially a protestant of, meaning your phrase non-binary specifically EXCLUDES pansexuals, hermaphrodites, transsexuals, transgender, because IRONICALLY it only includes men and women, alone, as the binary you are protestant of. 8 ) Which means that by using the phrase ""non-binary"" you are a hypocrite, and, as herein now demonstrated, still using those words inaccurately!! 9 ) So another phrase accurately describing you is Gender Protestant, and the ""non-binary [SIC]"" ""movement"" itself could more correctly described as ""distinction rebellion"", ... ; and therefore: 10) When asked to describe you, incorrectly labeled ""non-binary"" person, do not describe that which you are not, but that which YOU ARE, because you exist. 11) Three viable options for that description OF THAT WHICH YOU ARE are: Prima (First): Sans Polar Secunda (Second): Trans Polar Tertia (Third): Gender Protestant And more! 12) WORDS ARE IMPORTANT AND HAVE POWER INDEPENDENT OF MAN'S USE AND AGENCY THEREOF, AND YOU ARE USING WORDS WRONG AND BEING HUFFY ABOUT IT, IT IS THE EPITOME OF IGNORANCE AND IS IN FACT CULTURAL APPRPORIATION, AND MOREOVER INCORRECT!!!  Accordingly So,...: Please stop using the phrase non-binary incorrectly. Use of the phrase ""non-binary"" nets the same results as would your use of the phrase ""non-tabulary"", which means, you aren't a picnic table, either.Caston George is a 10-year veteran political professional and former politician, accomplished writer, researcher, author, and archivist."
20,The Russia-Ukraine War and The Emerging New Gas Order,politics," I am a holder of a Bachelor of Laws Degree from the Catholic University of Malawi. I write mostly on politics, history and philosophy. The Russia-Ukraine war has forced some Western powers to unleash an unprecedented avalanche of economic sanctions. Russia is limping hard – some sort of soft power at work. Being the World's largest gas producer, Russia has reacted by demanding that all its oil be bought in rubles – in fact, Russia has threatened to halt gas deliveries altogether. And in fear of being accused of helping Russia fund the war, western powers have suggested boycotting Russian gas. That is easily said than done. But as the events slowly unravel, a 'new gas order' is in the offing. A few statistics will avail much in understanding the current energy order. For starters, Russia is the third biggest producer of oil in the world, behind the US and Saudi Arabia. Russia is the EU's main supplier of crude oil, natural gas, and solid fossil fuels. It is estimated that in 2019, almost two-thirds of extra EU crude oil came from Russia. Another study estimated that Russia contributed three-quarters of the EU's imports of natural gas. While the UK and the US are not much dependent on Russian gas, it is apparent that the EU is heavily dependent on Russian gas. With those statistics, it does not seem realistic for European countries especially Germany to boycott Russian gas. A serious attempt to do so may cripple the economic operations of many western countries. The west with its rivalry against Russia should have envisaged this situation and planned for a way out beforehand.  But lack of foresight has put western countries between a rock and a hard. It is estimated that during the war, Russia has made gas sales with European countries to the tune of a whopping $30 Billion. Well, the irony is that those sales are used to fund the very war western countries are trying to stop. The only way out of this conundrum is to set forth a new gas order so that Russia is reduced to an insignificant EU supplier of gas. It has been speculated that Africa has huge gas reserves that can supplant Russian gas. Some Middle Eastern big gas producers like the United Arab Emirates have also shown interest in supplanting Russian gas. But how realistic is this? Can this war lead to a new gas order? Africa's Potential to Supply EU with Gas It is estimated that Africa has more than 7% of the global gas reserves – which is about 148.6 trillion cubic metres. In 2020, Algeria recorded the highest natural gas production in Africa reaching up to 85 billion standard cubic metres. Countries like Egypt and Nigeria followed behind with an estimated output of 62 billion and 50 billion cubic metres, respectively. In 2021, Algeria ranked as one of the top five Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exporters to Europe. Apart from the aforementioned countries Angola and Sudan have large proven crude oil reserves amounting to 7.8 billion cubic metres and 5.0 billion cubic metres, respectively. The above figures show an obvious potential that Africa can be a key gas supplier to the EU – however, several factors make this possibility unrealistic. First of all, Africa's production capacity is very low. Even the biggest African oil producers fail to meet their daily quotas – for example, Nigeria managed to pump 94% of its 1.7 million –barrel-per-day quota and Angola only managed to pump in 78% of its 1.4 million barrel-per-day quota. In terms of Algeria, it was observed by Alice Gower, director of geopolitics and security at Azure Strategy, a think tank, that Algeria's gas reserves are not well developed. Moreover, poor infrastructure and lack of investment render Africa's potential to produce gas at a massive rate impossible. However, with this new attempt to wean Europe off Russian gas dependence, several developments have been commenced. Sonatrach, an Algerian state-owned oil company, has announced a $40 billion investment package for five years. Moreover, Algeria, Niger, and Nigeria have agreed on the construction of a Trans-Sub-Saharan Gas Pipeline known as NIGAL. This pipeline will transport an estimated 30 billion cubic metres of gas per year to Algeria and connect to the existing networks to Europe. Middle Eastern Region The Middle East region holds half of the world's crude oil reserves and has large amounts of natural gas reserves. In 2018, it was estimated that 38.4% of the world's proven natural gas reserves were in the Middle East – this is equivalent to 6 951.8 trillion cubic metres. Iran, Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, and Iraq hold the largest natural gas reserves in the Middle Eastern region – Iran and Qatar have the largest natural gas reserves to the tune of 31.9 trillion cubic metres and 24.7 trillion cubic metres, respectively. So, can the Middle East region replace the Russian gas supply to the EU? According to Qatar, it is almost impossible. Firstly, most of Qatari's gas volumes are linked to long-term contracts with most Asian buyers like China, South Korea, and Japan. However, Qatar intends to raise its LNG production capacity from 77 to 126 million tomes by 2027. On the other hand, Iran has been operating under heavy economic sanctions from the US which have crippled its gas production capacity – from an average of 4.1% in 2016-2018 to 0.02% in 2020 crude oil exports to the EU. Iran's relations with Western countries do not put it in a favourable place as a potential key gas supplier to the EU. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, has resisted Western calls to increase oil production in a bid to remain steadfast in upholding its OPEC Plus agreement. The US The US promised to rapidly increase its exports of LNG to the EU by an additional 15 billion cubic metres by the end of 2022. This is in comparison with the 22 billion cubic metres exported last year. In a G-7 meeting, president Biden pledged to help support the countries as they phase out their reliance on the Russian gas supply. However, there are several drawbacks – if the US is to significantly increase its gas supply to the EU, it means that it will involve reallocation of cargoes headed for other locations. Furthermore, constructing the infrastructure needed to increase supply like building enough terminals could take a couple of years. America has plenty of natural gas but much of it is in shale fields – but the problem is that, unlike crude oil, the process of shipping and exporting natural gas is rather complicated. And building import and export terminals can be very expensive and time-consuming. All in all, for the time being, the US does not have enough capacity to increase its gas supply to Europe in place of Russia. What's Next? On the table, the options are varied and vast. It is up to the western countries to gauge and agree on what is the best alternative. Unleashing economic sanctions on Russia and cringing to Russian gas is a contradiction the west cannot continue to live with. It's either one or the other. The Russia-Ukraine war has taught the west a few lessons about the drawbacks of soft power. Whatever lessons that have been learnt, a decision has to be made. Russia can no longer maintain its position as the EU's largest gas supplier. A new gas order has to emerge and Russia will not be part of it. © 2022 Elenimo Chembe"
21,The End of Russia as a Great Power?,politics," On February 24th, 2022,what was widely viewed as the world’s second most powerful army launched a special military operation in Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine on all fronts, aiming for a quick and rapid victory which would topple the Ukrainian regime, and probably lead to the installation of a Russian-backed puppet government. Arsenals of charts had shown huge Russian advantages in tanks, aircraft, fighting vehicles, troops, ships, and of equipment of generally notably more modern and better quality, from an army which is well reputed for operational skill and had just 8 years before won a crushing victory over the Ukrainian army in the Donbass and Crimea War. Russia's victory day parades are an excellent snapshot of the most glorified depictions of the Russian army. Over a month later, and the Russian army increasingly looks to be the second strongest in Ukraine. Its troops have been sent reeling back in defeat from Kiev, their breakout efforts from Crimea have been contained, and its offensives in the Donbass only make grudging progress and it remains to be seen if they will achieve anything operationally. Russia has failed to secure air superiority, or even to make much effective use of its airforce, despite massive numerical advantages. It has suffered embarrassing setbacks against Ukrainian drones and even aircraft despite possessing its formidable air defense assets. Russian logistics have proven incapable of supporting advances of more than a few dozen miles into Ukraine, with the dismal spectacle of massive Russian traffic jams and widespread looting by hungry and ill-disciplined Russian soldiers – probably abetted and allowed by their officers, officers who have died in shockingly large numbers to Ukrainian attacks taking advantage of dismal Russian communications. The mortifying example of hundreds upon hundreds of Russian tanks, transports, even advanced air defense vehicles, abandoned by their crews or out of gas, and captured by Ukrainian farmers has turned Russian armor into a laughingstock, hideously vulnerable, incompetent tanks who try to protect themselves against Western AT weapons like Javelins with “cope cage” armor on top. The only thing which the Russian army has proved to be good at is shelling civilians and retreating, as well as engaging in atrocious and sickening massacres like at Bucha. Even Igor the farmer got himself a Russian tank! Vast numbers of Russian tanks, APCs, IFVs, even advanced air defense vehicles were hauled away by Ukrainian tractors after being abandoned. Many of these flaws can be explained by poor morale, motivation, and dismal planning. But the disaster is more systemic. Even elite Russian troops have been defeated in conventional battles by Ukrainian opponents. The 4th Guards Tank Division, a storied unit equipped overwhelmingly with professional soldiers and the best equipment which the Russians have, supposed to be a peer competitor to NATO armored formations, was crushed by the Ukrainian 93rd Mechanized Brigade during the Battle of Trostyanets north of Kyiv/Kiev[1]. This was a conventional, stand up fight, the exact type of battle the 4th Guards was designed for, and yet it lost, and lost decisively to far better Ukrainian tactical skills which separated infantry from tanks, picked apart Russian units, and destroyed command and control. Captured Russian UAVs show that their components are overwhelmingly imported and often of low quality [2], meaning the Russian military industrial complex is simply incapable of producing modern advanced technology like them. Widespread corruption in the Russian military with poor maintenance and sold equipment plagues operational standards. Tactical skills are terribly lacking.[3] The Russians went into Ukraine for many reasons, but an important part of it is presumed to have been to show off its skills and impress the world: to demonstrate that Russia is a military peer to the United States, capable of invading Ukraine like how the United States invaded Iraq. Instead, it has revealed that the Russian army and military is largely a paper tiger, at least in this sort of expeditionary war. The credibility of Russian forces have been severely damaged: from the nightmare scenarios of a Russian lightning strike on the Baltic States, seizing them and entrenching and daring NATO to retake them, the image of a professional, tough, hard-hitting army, and an advanced symbol of the might of Putin’s regime, there is now a picture of stumbling incompetents incapable of defeating even Ukraine, much less NATO formations. Before the war, one of the claims was that the Ukrainians would simply accept their Russian brothers, as willing members of the triune. The catastrophic misperception was at the heart of the invasion's failure. This would all have been bad enough, but the invasion of Ukraine carried with it tremendous costs economically and strategically, ones which Russia largely underestimated. Massive sanctions were imposed on Russia, and even when the war ends and these are in part lifted, they will dramatically constrain Russia’s future growth in high technology sectors and integration into the world economy. Brain drain has further increased, and this from a country whose education base has already greatly atrophied from Soviet times. European countries are making efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil and gas, diversifying supplies, and cancelling Russia-friendly strategic projects like Nordstream II.[4] Russia economically looks likely to become a mere appendage of China. Russian influence in much of Europe and America has suffered a catastrophic blow. While Russia has been perceived more and more negatively from 2014 onwards, with the annexation of Crimea, interference in Western elections, and aggressive espionage acts, there were still plenty of voices willing to work with Russia and various Russian friendly elements. Some still exist, but opinion in Europe and America is much more decisively anti-Russian, and there have been exposures of hundreds upon hundreds of Russian intelligence assets.[5] Finland and Sweden have become much more amenable to joining NATO. Perhaps the most disastrous in the long term is that Russia’s influence in Ukraine has evaporated: Ukrainians have shown themselves to be fiercely opposed to Russia, devoted to their independence, willing to fight for it, and certainly not willing to be the junior members of the triune nation of Great, White, and Little Russians. Even if Ukraine is formally established as a neutral state after the war ends, in practice it will always be a de-facto NATO ally and implacably opposed to Russia. Economically, internationally, militarily, even in some senses demographically with casualties and large numbers of Russians who have fled the country[6], Russia has suffered a crippling blow. Even in seemingly untouched areas of influence, seeds of future disaster have been sown: Russian troop strength has had to be decreased in Syria, in its peacekeeping role in Armenia, and Russian minorities henceforth will have the same suspicion applied to them as for German minorities in the 1940s: that they are a security threat, a tool of potential Russian intervention. States like Kazakhstan with large Russian minorities will doubtless be more wary of Russia in the future. Before the war in Ukraine, Russia had six pillars of support behind its status as a global, great power. Almost all of these have been undermined: only #6 is untouched, although with catastrophic readiness of Russian units even this has had some questions raised about this: how many Russian missiles will really fire, how many nukes really work? It’s a question which is hard to know since it is an issue where the Russian government really does place preeminent importance, and almost certainly one where enemies won’t dare to try to test Russia: the costs of being wrong are too grievous to take the risk. But in any future severe crisis with Russia, Western nations might be more willing to take risks, gambling that the Russian nuclear arsenal is just as rotten as the conventional military. Russia does too of course still have its UN Security Council seat, although it is mostly diplomatically isolated, with only minor statues like Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, and Syria backing it, although admittedly China and India both are neutral or friendly. One can easily see that there are very few nations explicitly allied with Russia, although there are many who aren't opposed. Jurta What’s more, rebuilding Russian strength and finding alternative bases of power is a nightmarish challenge. The Russian military’s problems cannot be simply fixed by a larger budget: Russia already spends outsized amounts of money on its military, and it has a demographically hefty burden placed by its large military forces as a proportion of its population. Endemic and systemic corruption means that money put into the army leaks like a sieve, and the Soviet legacy systems – already shown to be of extremely questionable military value due to their disastrous performance in Ukraine against modern anti-tank and drone forces - are often sold off or left irreparable. Fixing Russian military problems will require massive reforms, ones which are in many ways incompatible with Russia’s state: cleansing corruption, building up a real NCO body since the increasing requirements for flexibility and technical competence in modern warfare make a Soviet officer-heavy army less tenable, improved training, the end of its brutal internal terror of the dedovshchina (Russian army hazing), and a military industrial complex capable of producing advanced modern electronics. And it will require a hard look at what it really can do, and in all probability a scaling down of ambitions. But cleaning up corruption is simply not really possible in Putin’s Russia: Putin’s wealth is unconfirmed but if Western analysts are correct, he is without a doubt the most corrupt man in the world, having embezzled hundreds of billions of dollars[7]. The oligarchs and other figures below are just as corrupt, and a real cleaning up of corruption, from the top down, is simply incompatible with the Putin system, itself a more nationalistic continuation of the Yeltsin system. A real NCO corps with initiative and individual thinking could easily be a threat to the authoritarianism and reliability of the military. Improved training will be expensive on an anemic economy. And the military industrial complex will eternally struggle with managing to stay competitive in advanced electronics and modern technology with the massive brain drain from Russia: the only way to stop this would be a massive reform of the Russian economy or ending freedom of movement, both effectively impossible. Russia’s system is a mafia one, capable of oil production and exporting, but with an increasingly withered away technical and industrial economy. This leads back to a vital factor for launching the war in Ukraine in the first place: Russia is a declining power, and this is obvious even to the Russians themselves. The population is dwindling, the economy stagnant or shrinking, the industrial base atrophied, decaying, more and more outdated. If Ukraine had worked as Russia predicted – if Ukraine had been swiftly and easily conquered – then it would have served greatly to buttress Russian power, its sphere of influence expanded, its defensive capabilities against NATO magnified, its population size would have been fortified. Instead its gamble to prop up its position has merely served to massively degrade Russia’s power. All of the problems mentioned above will only get worse as time goes on. Russian pipelines are still overwhelmingly to Europe This grim picture continues in most areas. Certainly, oil supplies will continue to be important for a long time to come, even with the rise of renewable energy production. But there are other alternatives, and European states like Germany approved the construction of liquid natural gas terminals, to reduce their dependence on Russia. And the aforementioned renewable energy will in the long term take their toll. The only element of the economy as far as broader trends go which can be said to be truly positive is global warming, which will make large swathes of Siberia much more habitable, but the Russian population is declining and this will make it difficult to actually make use of this. To fix Russia’s demographic problems would require a much more functional economy and massive expenditures on social welfare and social provisions: research shows that small payments to women to have more children simply doesn’t cut it[8], vast expenditures are required. With the amount of money diverted by oligarchs into their own pockets this social program cannot be achieved, and Russia’s population will continue to atrophy. Mass immigration might help, and there are already large numbers of guest workers in Russia, but continued political stability and the ideological implications of turning Siberia into a majority non-Russian area are clear issues with this. And whether there is much of a desire to move to Russia with the recent economic crises is up for debate. The decline of Russian population is not simply internal. Russian minorities are also shrinking throughout much of the Near Abroad, slowly declining. Kazakhstan at independence was around 1/3 Russian: now it is 1/5[9]. Ukraine’s Russian-speaking population is declining faster than that of the Ukrainian side of the country, and even worse they clearly do not feel themselves to be Russian. This vital tool of continued Russian influence is on the wane: it is a wasting asset. And what of Russia’s ideological competition to the West? This too is less viable: the popular mood in the West is extremely hostile to Russia. Putin’s image as an authoritarian strongman, unlike the decadent West, has been decisively shattered. Russia is no longer the legions of proud soldiers marching in the May 9th Victory Day parade in Moscow, or the defender of tradition and Orthodoxy: it is hardscrabble armies of war criminals, poverty, butchers, and aggressors, and sympathy with Russia is clearly beyond the pale. If you take the traditional attributes of a Great Power: a large and powerful economy, extensive influence over other nations, a military capable of competing with other great powers, Russia is clearly falling out of the great power club, a trend which had started decades ago but the sheer extent of this collapse was masked until now. Russia seems likely to become more and more an appendage of China, a supplier of raw materials to China, turning to the only other power which can offer some support for it. Russia seemed at first like a partner of China: then it seemed like a junior partner, and now it looks to not even be a partner at all – just a glorified Chinese vassal. So long as the Yeltsin-Putin system continues in Russia, of massive corruption, cynicism, organized looting of the Russian economy, Russia looks likely to continue its decadence and fall. Of course, what will come after Putin, who has singularly failed to assure a successor, is anyone’s guess… And fascinating too, is how Russia as a security council membership will continue to develop. Russia has lost the attributes of a great power in most regards, other than nukes: India is almost certainly far more suited to being a security council member, with its larger population, economy, and global diplomatic influence, but there is no mechanism to remove a permanent security council member. The shift from the ROC to the PRC was an exception, since it involved simply the transfer from one Chinese faction to another, rather than to another nation: any displacement of Russia’s seat will be a far more ugly and messy affair. It isn’t likely to happen anytime soon, but it will be an interesting feature to see how the world handles the first decline and fall of a great power in a century.

22,When India Assumed 300 Million of its Population Dead (The Event Which Sent Chills Down the Spine of US President).,politics," Stuart Bingham, OGL v1.0, via Wikimedia The ongoing war between Ukraine & Russia has intrigued me as it has many parallels vis-a-vis India-Pakistan wars. To begin with, both Pakistan and Ukraine were previously the part of India and USSR respectively. Also, both the pair have territorial disputes between themselves. And since I am closely following the developments unfolding in Ukraine war, an incident which occurred during Indo-Pak kargil war flashed through my mind. And made me ponder, would Russia had still invaded Ukraine if the later had not given up its nuclear arms? Late Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Deccan Herald, CC BY-SA 2.0 Indian soldiers of 18th Battalion before assault on point 4700. Cgirish, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia. The year was 1999 and there was an new hope of peace in the almost always tense relations between India and Pakistan. Late Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then prime minister of India had initiated the peace process and visited Pakistan in February. The Lahore agreement of 1999 was signed with a vision of peace, stability and prosperity between the two nations. However, just 3 months after the visit, Pakistan returned the favor by capturing many strategically important posts inside the Indian territory. Pakistan took advantage of an unofficial agreement between both the armies, which stated that both sides would vacate their respective posts on the mountainous peaks owing to harsh winter conditions every year. However, Pakistan displayed complete disrespect to it, as well as the Lahore agreement it signed just a few months earlier. Furious at this breach of trust, Indian army launched an vigorous attack on the posts captured by Pakistan. Pakistani army were at a huge advantage as they were fortified at higher altitudes. The advancing Indian forces were exposed to the downward firings of the intruders. Despite odds in their favor, Pakistan started losing the posts under sustained Indian army assaults. The situation started getting tense in Pakistan because it was already facing the world's ire for this treacherous act. And now, it was also looking at the prospect of being humiliated by its traditional foe. US, an ally of Pakistan back then, refused to help it out militarily or financially. However, by the medium of backchannel diplomacy, US was constantly pressurizing both the sides to end the war. India, like many a times earlier, displayed its fierce will to protect its territorial integrity. It asked US to guarantee the withdrawal of Pakistan to status quo ante, something that US failed to do. By the end of June, India snatched back a large portion of its lost territory. Nawaz Sharif.

Indian Army, GODL-India, via Wikimedia Nuclear capable Agni 5 Missile of India DRDO / Ministry of Defence, Government of India, GODL, via Wikimedia. With no way out of this humiliation, General Parvez Musharraf of Pakistan sent Nawaz Sharif (then prime minister of Pakistan) to US. Here, the pressure to end the war was clear on Sharif. According to Bruce Reidel, a special assistant to Bill Clinton, then president of US, Vajpayee refused an face-to-face meeting with Nawaj to be organised in US. Bruce was on the team which discussed parleys with Pakistan to withdraw unconditionally from LoC. Desperate, Nawaz Sharif informed Bill Clinton that Pakistan was readying its nuclear weapons. Stunned, US immediately dialled up Vajpayee, despite it being night in New Delhi, and once again asked to immediately withdraw the troops. Vajpayee asked if Pakistan would do the same? After a brief pause, Clinton broke the news of Pakistan threatening the use of its nuclear weapons. There was an real danger of nuclear weapon being used by both the warring nations.After an uneasy few seconds which would have felt like an eternity to both the men, came an cold but iron-willed voice of Vajpayee. And the message it delivered sent the chills down the spine of even the most powerful man on this planet, a.k.a president of US, as well as the US officials and Pakistani establishments. Vajpayee said,"" From this point of time, I have already assumed 20-30% of our population dead. We will survive. But I want you to assure Nawaz Sharif that Pakistan will not be able to see tomorrow's sunrise "", and hung up the phone.People who knew Vajpayee will attest that he was not bluffing. Vajpayee assumed that some 300 million of Indian population would lose their lives. It was all the more painful for him because he genuinely felt that Pakistan would reciprocate favourably to his peace initiatives. The Pakistani and US officials knew that if Pakistani army attacked India with nuclear weapon, Indian army would retaliate with tremendously powerful nuclear assault. With the fate of entire country on the line, Pakistan officially declared unconditional withdrawal from Kargil on 5th July 1999.

23,Carl Jung and the Philippine Presidents,politics," Prof Frederick V. Rael has been teaching for almost  20 years in various local colleges and universities in the Philippines. Introduction Carl Gustav Jung, a famous Psychologist, said “Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.” This quote would remind us of how we tend to project on others what we love or hate on our inner self. During this heated political season, we must be careful of expressing our admiration or hatred toward a political candidate because such behavior would tell us something about our inner self, which might surprise us. I have learned so much about Carl Jung as I continue my doctoral degree in Applied Cosmic Anthropology. I have been fascinated by many of Carl Jung’s concepts specifically the collective unconscious and the archetypes. In this blog, I would like to apply these concepts to understanding the common patterns of the Philippine Presidents from Ferdinand Marcos to President Rodrigo Duterte. I would like to remind the readers that this essay is a result of my honest analysis as a teacher of history and vast experience as a voter. Who is Carl Jung? Carl Jung was an avid follower of Sigmund Freud. Although some of his concepts emanated from the Freudian perspective, Carl Jung made his mark by introducing his insights and intriguing concepts such as the persona/shadow, collective unconscious, archetypes, and many more. For Carl Jung, the collective unconscious is the deepest part of the human mind in which many of our darkest, unpleasant images, knowledge, beliefs, perceptions, or anything that influences our behavior are buried or suppressed. For Freud, the unconscious mind contains images or ideas that emanated from personal experiences. But, for Carl Jung, the collective unconscious contains archetypes that were inherited from the past collective experiences of the human race. These archetypes are shared collectively from one generation to another. As the term suggests, we are not aware of these archetypes unless we go through the process of individuation (which is another term for another essay or discussion). Archetypes, on the other hand, refer to the concepts or images that are universal frameworks of people that characterize common behavior or personality. Archetypes influences behavior because they are ingrained in the subconscious mind of every person. We possess these archetypes and we also want to see them in other people, which Jung called projection. My Encounter with the Philippine Presidents When Ferdinand Marcos Sr. rose into power, I was a grade school pupil. As I remember it right, I hated President Marcos simply because he removed Voltes V from the regular TV programming. I found out later on by reading many studies about the adverse impacts of watching TV that President Marcos was right that children should not watch too many cartoons because they may acquire bad study habits. When EDSA People Power 1 happened, I was in high school. It was the time when I was still busy going out with my friends and trying to enrich my social life. In other words, I did not care so much about politics but the media fed me with facts that contributed to my slight increase in political awareness. After several years, President Fidel Ramos was elected. I was already a development manager officer/researcher in one of the attached agencies of Malacanang, an agency that caters to the rebel returnees. So, I could say that I have some insights into the behavior and leadership qualities of President Ramos and how he managed the government bureaucracy. When Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Benigno Aquino III, and Rodrigo Duterte became presidents in their respective periods of Philippine history, I was already teaching social science subjects in college. What is the archetype that Filipino voters want in a president? The main question that I want to address in this blog is,” What is the archetype that Filipino voters want in a president?”What did we see in Ferdinand Marcos, Cory Aquino, Erap Estrada, etc.?” By briefly examining the collective unconscious of the Filipino psyche, we would be able to reveal the reasons what qualities that we Filipinos are looking for in a leader. We, Filipinos, are most of the time criticized for voting for the wrong leader. Foreign experts would often say that Filipinos have always fallen into a trap of choosing incompetent or corrupt leaders. Perhaps, it is not our fault but the qualities that we see in ourselves (collective unconscious) tend to project on the president or presidential candidate that we choose. Let’s begin with Ferdinand Marcos, who was a strong-willed and intelligent leader. He was a lawyer, a soldier, and a known dictator because he implemented Martial Law in the 1970s to subjugate the insurgency problem and urgently install some institutional reforms to fast-track the economy. A leader who was too focused on achieving results that manifested into many large and useful infrastructure projects in the Philippines. Cory Aquino, his predecessor, and close rival was a gentle and wise widower. She immediately became popular because of the death of her husband Benigno Aquino Sr. Despite her lack of political experience, she became the symbol of democracy and a perceived heroine because she played a major role in the ousting of Ferdinand Marcos. Fidel Ramos, the anointed one of Cory Aquino, was a strong and highly experienced military leader. He was an enabler of the Martial Law enforced by Ferdinand Marcos because he was the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces and Secretary of National Defense. Ironically, he was also instrumental in the ouster of his Commander in Chief Ferdinand Marcos that catapulted Cory Aquino into power. He was a known peacemaker as shown in the several programs that he implemented that benefited the rebel returnees and other insurgents during his administration. President Ramos was succeeded by Joseph Estrada, who was a famous actor or action star in the Philippine cinema during his time. He is a strong, generous, sincere, and caring leader. Although he was criticized for being a womanizer and a college dropout, President Estrada acquired enormous support from the Filipino masses because of his slogan,” Erap para sa Mahirap” or “Erap for the poor”. Indeed, Filipinos tend to be seduced by such an appealing slogan since it touches our inner core, particularly our deep sympathy for the poor. After a strong and caring leader, Filipinos brought to power Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, an economist, through another people power or EDSA 2. She is the second woman president of the Philippines and the daughter of former President Diosdado Macapagal. She was an intelligent and strong-willed leader who was willing to make unpopular choices for the sake of the country. While she was working silently and effectively at a government agency as a vice president that provided social services for the poor, she was launched into power when Filipinos became disoriented with President Estrada’s Administration through another Filipino version of “people power.” For some karmic reasons, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was also accused of corruption and was replaced by Benigno Aquino III, the son of Cory Aquino. President Benigno Aquino III was a well-educated, simple, gentle, and passionate leader. He was also known as an anti-corrupt leader. His leadership qualities were not so much a factor in his bid for the presidency but the death of his mother became his key to occupying the highest position in the Philippines. Again, we would observe that Filipinos have the habit of putting leaders into power through sympathy votes. After a gentle leader, the next leader who has risen into power was President Rodrigo Duterte. He is a strong, decisive, popular but at the same time a controversial strong leader. He was able to ravish his opponents during the debates of the 2016 national election through his wittiness and machismo behavior that were appealing to the masses. As an unknown player on the national scene, he was able to mesmerize the Filipino voters through his slogan,” Change is coming.” Indeed, Filipinos are thirsty for change. His platforms in fighting illegal drugs, corruption, and criminality reflected his personality, a strong-willed crime fighter. He is a leader who would never back out of any commitment despite the strong criticisms of some local politicians and international observers. Archetypes of Filipino Leaders So, what type of a leader that Filipinos are looking for? Based on the analysis presented above, we like a leader who is strong-willed, decisive, and intelligent but also caring, passionate, and gentle. Simply put, we prefer a Zeus-like leader with a heroic appeal to the masses. We like to worship those who would appear to us as our savior. Someone like Zeus who will give us hope and is capable of solving all of our problems in a snap of his lighting volt. A leader with heroic traits who can make the ultimate decision for the sake of all. By using Jung’s theory of mythology, we could surmise that Filipinos have always been looking for a hero to save them. Most of us believe that poverty, unemployment, and other social problems that we encounter in our society can be immediately solved by a leader, a hero. Our frustration tends to escalate after we observe that the leader that we admired during the campaign period doesn’t exhibit the traits that we projected onto them. In short, our expectations are far from the reality, which leads to the overthrowing of the leader that we are supposed to worship. Conclusion Maybe, it is about time that we admit to ourselves that the presidential candidate will not magically save all of our personal and social problems. Leaders are effective with the help and strong support of the people. We should refrain from projecting a Zeus or hero-like version of a leader so that we would not be frustrated after the election. Let us remember that our leaders (regardless of their enormous popularity, high level of education, admirable intelligence, and other blinding positive qualities) are mere mortals. No one leader (strong-willed or not) could save us from our dismal conditions. Our leaders are there to guide our nation toward the common good and unity. They have their shares of flaws, bad track records, as well as admirable traits. We must do something with our lives by tapping our inner strengths so that we will not rely so much on our leaders. The coming May 9 election in the Philippines is about our welfare as a nation and not about the presidential candidates. We must cast our votes intelligently by digging into our inner selves instead of allowing ourselves to be influenced by external factors such as social media garbage, political propaganda, misleading campaigns, baseless accusations of political rivals, and dirty politics.

24,Ukraine Under Fire,politics," Vladimir Putin is a cold heart dictator, who doesn't care about taking the lives of innocent children.  Who would he react if this was his President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a powerful speech by video chat appealing to members of Congress for a no-fly zone and more aid. He thanked President Joe Biden for standing behind Ukraine but said more needs to be done. Zelensky said it was not too much to ask for a no-fly zone. He wanted Biden to impose stiffer sanctions on Russia. Zelensky said the United States understood making refers to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the terrorism of the New York Trade Center. He used the words of Martin Luther King about Ukraine having a dream. After the speech, he showed a graphic video showing the destruction of Ukraine. President  Zelensky says other nations are not doing enough. After some members of  Congress saw the video, some members broke down in tears, after they saw the destruction of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainings are is refusing to give up their country to Russia without a fight, they are willing to die for their country. Vladimir Putin Unleashed his soldiers against Ukrainians, leaving a blooded massacre After the Video shown by President Vodolymyr made his plea for help President Joe Biden. Two hours after the speech of Volodymyr, President Biden signed an emergency package for Ukraine. The package includes 100 drones,anti-armor, machine guns, shotguns, grenades launchers, and ammunition artillery. If Nato enforces a no-fly zone over Ukraine and shoots down a Russian plane, they would consider that as an act of war. The United States is doing everything it can except to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, which could start a war between the United States and Russia. If Vladimir Putin is not stopped by President Volodymyr in Ukraine, he will not stop, he will go after Europe. Putin is trying to rebuild the Soviet Union because he believes Eastern Europe belongs to Russia. Vladimir Putin thought his forces would take over Ukraine, with Ukrainians surrendering and not fighting back. Ukrainian was stronger than he anticipated. Putin is sociopathy who needs to be stopped, sanctions have not worked against him. Vladimir Putin is a world threat. Putin has ignored every sanction that the United States and other countries hs brought before him, believing that nothing or nothing or no one can stop him. Who will stop Vladimir Putin from him?        "
25,"Imran Khan Loses Midnight No-Trust Vote, Ousted as Pak PM",politics," MG is a senior air warrior who is an alumnus of the Staff College and a notable writer on military history. A macabre tragedy has been played out in Pakistan. For the first time in the history of Pakistan, a Pakistani Prime Minister lost a vote of no confidence and was ousted. This happened in the early hours of Sunday after a day of high voltage drama. Imran Khan who has very little grassroots support was propped up by the army which is referred to as the establishment as Prime Minister after the previous incumbent Nawaz Sharif had been removed by dubious means. They only tolerated him for some time, to be exact 3 1/2 years and during this period it was observed that he was a maverick leader who spoilt Pakistan's relations with the United States and put all the eggs in the Chinese basket. He also began to make overtures to Russia and overall he failed totally on the economic front with inflation ruling the roost and piling up crippling external debt. Worse he began to hobnob with extremist Islamic parties and make deals with them which the army did not like. With the economy in Dire Straits and the United States, having decided that Imran was not fit to be the Prime Minister of Pakistan the army got into the act. At their instigation, the joint opposition which consisted of diverse parties with diverse political philosophies was encouraged to come together and propose a vote of no confidence against Imran khan. Just after midnight on Sunday on a directive from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the National Assembly reconvened and172 members voted to oust Imran khan. Khan, 69, was absent when the voting took place. The combined opposition has named Shehbaz Sharif, president of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz as a compromise candidate for the post of Prime Minister. He is the younger brother of Nawaz Shariff who had been ousted when the Army lost confidence in him. Nawaz had always been at loggerheads with the army and in earlier 2 tints had been dismissed as prime minister and in one case exiled to Saudi Arabia for 10 years. In his last stint, he had been given 10 years of rigorous imprisonment on charges of corruption when his name surfaced in the Panama papers. The Army was however unhappy that during his tenure the previous president General Mushraff had been sentenced to death by a special bench of the High Court and this rankled the generals. The opposition had filed the no-confidence motion on March 8.  Khan was fighting tooth and nail not to resign as PM. He used every stratagem to escape resignation including asking the deputy speaker to negate the motion of no confidence and asking the president to dissolve the Senate and order fresh elections. He also began to stoke the embers of discontent in public speeches by asserting that he was being targeted by a 'foreign country' with local collaborators. He dropped a dark hint that the country was the USA. The USA denied the accusation. Khan had come to power in 2018 with promises to create a ‘Naya Pakistan.' But apart from rhetoric, his achievement was zero. The Achilles heel of Imran was the loss of support from the powerful Army. The problem had blown up when he did not approve of General Bajwa's appointment of the ISI spy agency chief last year. He had to back down but observers had concluded that his days were numbered The bone of contention was Lt Gen Faiz Hameed who Imran wanted as the ISI Chief but Bajwa transferred him as Corps Commander in Peshawar. There was more to the eye than a simple appointment and rumors were abounding that ultimately he wanted to sideline the Army chief Gen Bajwa. There were many twists and turns throughout Saturday. Earlier the Supreme Court had struck down the ruling of the Dy Speaker and cleared the way for the Senate to convene and vote on the confidence motion. Just after midnight after a meeting with General Bajwa, Imran threw in the towel and resigned. It was the end of a macabre period in Pakistan history, akin to murder and magic like in Shakespeare's Macbeth. One can now see that this period of rule of Imran khan was a period of great stress in Pakistan's history after General Zia ul Haq. It was a period when many people were lynched to death in open streets on grounds of blasphemy and the extremist elements in Pakistan were given an umbrella. One hopes General Bajwa can now restore some of the ideals of Mohammed Ali Jinnah.

26,Lessons from Ukraine,politics," An amateur writer who enjoys writing, researching and exploring any topic that interests him. It is time for us to experience some positivity around despite all the chaos that has been swirling around our lives. Ukraine’s fight back against Russia and their hope is the kind of positivity we need to look upon. Six weeks passed and the Ukrainians still standing strong against the mighty Russian storm has become quite a sensation around the globe. The stories of allegiance and bravery from Ukrainians have gone round the clock. The cause of humanity has thus received the support of many nations. There's something to be gained from the time and events that occurs; it’s the lessons that gives a little optimistic growth in our endeavors'. Perhaps, the stories of Ukraine have something to offer too. Ukrainians leader aka the comedian turned into politician, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s story is among the best to describe loyalty and bravery. Since, the Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, President Zelenskyy’s stand against the fight has been quiet an exceptional. Despite US President Biden’s offer to evacuate, Zelenskyy’s decision to stay in Ukraine has made the Ukrainians proud of their president. ""The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride,"" were the words of courage from the President. In such situation, many previous incidents have displayed leaders fleeing their nation putting their lives above the country at the same time. For instance, look at the Afghani ex-president, Mohammad Ashraf Ghanni's escape after the Taliban attack. Thus, President Zelenskyy deserved the worldwide praised for his actions in defending his motherland. His story illuminates the true sense of leadership, courage, bravery and allegiance that one can really look upon. He has really proved himself to be the ‘Servant of the People” rather than just keeping it as a name that his party proclaims. Volodymyr Zelensky (C) walks through the town of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, the site of Russia's massacre of civilian residents In the midst of war and displacement, there is always a need of a helping hand and thus the story of Nadiya is an example of that. Nadiya, a retiree who has been living in a geriatric boarding house in Lutsk a city North-western of Ukraine bordering Poland, refused to leave the country. Despite having the opportunity to flee, she chose the opportunity to help. She is helping by making varenyky (dumplings) for soldiers and internally displaced people while sitting in her wheelchair. This is an act of kindness, a symbol of mother’s love in other way. Along with Nadiya, the entire geriatric house in Lutsk has stepped forward to lend a helping hand. About 140 wards and employees makes Varenyky (dumplings) to feed the military and displaced families, hence becoming mess sergeants.  Nadiya. There is a similar story of 26 year old Anastasiya, an IT recruiter and a blogger who, despite being alone in her country, choose to remain and help the civilians and pets. Her husband who lives in Sri Lanka, even told her to leave Kyiv, but Anastasiya stayed back, chose to volunteer for the sake of humanity. Amid heavy firing across the North-western part of the capital Kyiv, Anastasiya and her friends drove her car and delivered food and water to people living nearby the affected areas. Despite the fact that the Russians destroyed the bridge in Irpin that connected Bucha and Kyiv, she just didn't stop looking for other ways and routes to enter the city and helped many kindergartens, pet shelters, and private homes. However, on 4th march 2022, sadly Anastasia along with her two friends were shot to dead by a Russian tank while they were returning home from their humanitarian mission. The death of young Anastasia and her friends can be very miserable but the legacy that they have left behind can be the inspiration for many. Anastasiya hugging a dog at a pet shelter. “I found today that people who live close to shelling consider even a bottle of water to be a wonder,”–Anastasia wrote two days before she died. Residents in Kyiv are living under fire as Russian rockets and bombs fall on their houses. Utility workers from the city's utility services are working overtime to clean up the damage, debris and garbage left behind. Meet Roman Kryvokhatko, a heating network repairman who, has been in the frontlines to fix the city’s damaged pipelines. Roman had initially planned to join the territorial defense in the beginning of the war, but since his district was packed with volunteers, he decided to serve where he is needed. Similarly, Igor Oveshkov, a garbage truck driver has been doing his daily routine fearlessly without a complain saying that it is his responsibility. It’s scary for them at times but the most important is the work that needs to be done, is what they believe. It’s the positive attitude and the zeal towards their work that has made them special, unique and inspiring. Repairman Roman Kryvokhatko stands in a shell crater in the Vynogradar district of Kiev Igor Oveshkov, a garbage truck driver, on his daily routine to pick up litter around Kyiv. Yes, you heard it right; Ukraine has its own Hachiko too. The story that has been shared by the Nexta TV, a Belarusian media outlet where a dog is seen setting next to his dead owner, refusing to move has won the hearts on the internet. Many people have resembled it with Hachiko, a dog who is known for faithfulness’ and loyalty to his master. This story once again reminds us the innocence and faithfulness of dogs to his owners. Where humans fail, dogs excel, which is why sometimes dogs are regarded as man's best friend. For the ones, who is wondering who the Hachiko is, I suggest them to Google it and recommend to watch the movie starring Richard Gere. On the streets of Kyiv, a dog sits by its dead owner Indeed, the stories above have taught all of us a lesson. The everyday life of the Ukrainians amid the war has defined the hope in difficulty times. Perhaps, we are blessed enough to be able to just sit around and enjoy a cup of tea watching the internet memes surrounded by our own comfort zones. Through its actions, Ukraine has demonstrated the power of unity. People from all walks of life came together for one cause; a small act of kindness makes all the difference. While unity pertains to such difficult times, it can also be applied in our everyday lives, as we help each other in times of need. There is so much to learn indeed from the inspirations of a true leader, an elderly mother and a faithful dog. However, it depends on who you are, what you see and think about it, and what you take away at the end of the day and what you use it for as inspiration. Well, let’s hope peace will once again rejuvenate Ukraine and its people. Keep your stand and support Ukraine. This content reflects the personal opinions of the author.

27,On the Streets of Bakersfield: Drugged Out,politics," graffiti on a wall offers art and poetry The first group I approach are some people congregated in an alley behind a convenience store. One man sits against the fence, his head down, all in black, staring at the ground, mumbling to himself. Another woman, wearing clothes that resemble a tablecloth at a county picnic, walks along, her steps a little too jerky. She looks up at me and considers the water bottle I am offering her. ""Can I have two..?"" she asks, and looks up at me, a small stream of sweat slipping from the headband she has on. I pause for just a second and hesitate and she must have sensed it. ""...I need to wash the pee off."" I hand her a second bottle, and consider a third, but there are a few people here and I had only brought a small sample. A hungry oil derrick slips across the saturated Bakersfield dust The next two people I encounter are standing by a car. The door is open and I can see papers strewn about. Some clothing sits on the seat. By the look of the vehicle and the way that it is parked, I can tell that it is not just used for transportation. The front seat looks like a living room. My suspicions are confirmed in the dialogue I have with the woman named Lisa. ""What, you think you can come here and give us water? This is my space,"" she says. She stands in front of me straight up and looks as if she wants to pounce. I am slightly taken aback, but amused as well. However, I realize there is open space behind me and for a moment I wonder if I should worry. She has long red hair that looks like it was recently washed. She runs her fingers through it. And when her face is turned to the side, she smiles. Her expression changes when she turns my way. ""I'm independent you see,"" and points at her chest. There is a cross - the kind of cross you don't associate with churches - in her midsection. Designs and some other calligraphy surround it. She was obviously a fan of tattoo, but I doubt she visited any professional parlor establishments to acquire the markings. ""Between this and the two S esses (I know what she means by this) on my leg, that's what I am."" She stares at me again. Where her eyebrows should be are some worn out scribbling that I cannot decipher. The writing looks like it was acquired in a correctional facility, probably when she first entered the system many years ago. It's faded, but even if I could read the words, I probably would have ignored the messages. ""What? You think I'm pretty?"" she says and I can hear in her physical language that she isn't searching for a compliment. ""You're a very charming woman,"" I say. And try to smile. The man standing next to her straightens from his slouch. ""I'm Mr. Lisa"" he tells me. She looks at me again, and flails her arms straight down as if she were preparing for a yoga marathon. She picks up a bottle of colorful liquid, pulls it up to her thin lips and sips. ""I stabbed a caseworker once. Went to prison for it. Right now I am drunk. Or rather,"" she pauses, ""I've been drinking."" And I don't think asking for a copy of her rap sheet would be a good idea, even though I am wanting to verify if her proclamations about her experience with the California correctional system are authentic. Trust, but verify I think of the adage. ""This interview is over,"" she tells me. ""This is my territory. My home."" I know it is time to leave, but they remind me anyway. I walk away, a little confused, even though everything makes perfect sense. I head north on Highway 99 and get off on the Oildale exit. Oildale is a community north of Bakersfield, some say a place of it's own. The woman at the 7-Eleven I spoke with earlier, the one with writing for eyebrows said to me ""over there is Bakersfield, the city. This is the county. Wild country. It's own,"" as she pointed toward the bridge that crosses the Kern River. I pull into a gas station parking lot and find a spot of shade under the tree to rest my car. Already the noise of the traffic has slightly dissipated, muffled by the brush and the flat open space that looks like the surface of another planet. As i walk out toward the tents I see shimmering in the distance I notice some piles of empty butane containers. Hundreds, maybe thousands of them. And boxes. Butane is a popular ingredient when people manufacture wax from cannibals. Wax is a more potent form of the substance known for its visual appeal and its powerful intoxicating qualities. A little further down, it almost looks like someone demolished a house and buried the remains above ground. There are several chucks of rocks that were obviously not placed here by mother nature. I see the man stepping out from the tent and realize that I could be seen as a threat. I am also worried because many of the people I've encountered on the street have dogs. Some of them vicious. ""Hello,"" I say, lifting my hands in the air. I identify myself. I assure him I mean no harm. ""Would you like a water?"" I open my palms and pause to show that I am not carrying anything. ""Yeah sure,"" he responds. ""Let me tell my girl to hold the dog."" I hope it is a nice dog. butane cans As I approach the encampment, I see a woman underneath a tarp - for shade obviously. The temperature around us feels like someone opened an oven during a Thanksgiving dinner although the discernible aromas in the air no way resemble that of a cooked poultry. ""Why do you have dogs?"" I ask, knowing the answer as the question leaves my lips. I'm the type that likes to confirm the obvious. ""Well, everyone needs some lovin'. My other dog gave birth and this is the puppy. Dogs give protection too. They keep us feeling safe."" I ask them about the groups in the community that offer assistance. How helpful they are and what people out here really need. ""Clothes, a tent"" they both chime. ""They put me on a list but everyone gets help but me. Section 8. For me no deal"" the woman says. I look around and see a sign. ""Did you know him?"" I ask. ""Yeah. He was our friend,"" the man says. When I ask them permission to take a photo they tell me yes. They thank me for asking. I talk to them about the tiny house program, would it work here? In Bakersfield? I have read about programs that design shelters, basically sheds, for the homeless.  Some communities have entire tiny houses designed for those struggling with permanent shelter. I ask them what daily life is like in the camps. ""A lot of scandalous people,"" he tells me. ""They steal your stuff and sell it back to you twice what you paid for it?"" she says. ""People are pretty grimy,"" he says. ""How does that make you feel? What do you do?"" The obvious in me decides to make another query. ""You pick your battles,"" she says. The boy who the memorial was designed for was killed by a fentanyl overdose. The drug has become a serious problem recently with Oildale being one of the main segments of the city hit hardest. At least what you hear on the news. People on the street tell me different though. ""It happens in the rich areas,"" one says, ""they just cover it up better."" ""Yeah,"" chimed another.  ""Think of the Bakersfield 3."" One story in the local news cites that this new kind of dope is ""a synthetic opioid that serves as a powerful painkiller useful in cases like advanced-stage cancer. But it has now been appropriated for the illegal drug trade."" The number of overdoses reported has increased dramatically. It isn't unusual to see people nearly passed out, sitting down, their backs against the wall of a building. Especially in this part of Bakersfield. I noticed one earlier, when I parked my car under the shade. I don't ask any of the people I talk with about drugs or substance abuse. In most cases, it is a given that people on the street are struggling with issues. One wonders whether or not substance use contributes to homelessness or if it is a result thereof. In treatment, there are conditions which are co-occurring in which a mental disorder is initiated at the same time as addiction. Co-morbidity refers to a medical condition that is present when addiction begins. Many people who experience homelessness are also suffering from other mental health issues which may be contributing to the fact that they are in the place in which they find themselves. I think about the young man who died. The one the sign was erected for. There are bouquets of flowers and strands of glittering garlands that sway in the wind. It is large and colorful and looks as if were painted by loving, talented hands. From a distance it almost seems like an invitation to a party. One that everyone is invited to. And eventually, I know. Everyone will attend. more art and poetry It was quite amusing. I noticed this vehicle with what appeared to be  stickers all over it. I was curious. They were not your usual adornments you see on the bumpers as you navigate through traffic. These covered the entire car like a well negotiated paint job, by an artist under the influence of some spiritual persuasions. I approached cautiously because I noticed some milk crates on the ground, behind the fender facing away from me. That meant there was probably someone there. I saw a man at the trunk as I approached and asked permission to snap some photographs. When I spoke to him, I found out he was a comedian - his website is posted on the vehicle and I'll include a link to it in the next section. When I asked about the writings, he informed me that they were done by homeless people and that he sometimes performed at shelters. We talked briefly and I didn't want to encroach too much on his territory because I could sense an importance, a focus in the activities he planned for the day. And besides I was a stranger with a camera asking some very direct questions and capturing images of his transportation, perhaps some of his living quarters. I found out that during his performances, he would ask for donations of clothing, which he then handed out to some homeless camps. I offered him a few tips on where to look for groups, but I have noticed that many of the encampments diminished slightly. Some have disappeared. I would find out why as soon as I headed back into Bakersfield.... Elvis the comedian thirsty doggy As I leave Oildale, I head back into Bakersfield, heading up Chester Avenue. It is a Friday afternoon, and traffic is tight and I am always a little bit nervous moving through a roundabout. You have to be cautious about this one in particular because there are two lanes in the circle itself and some drivers enter the inner lane when they should have chosen the outer one. This causes confusion when their chosen exit is where your entrance is. The Garces circle as it is called - there is a statue of the Franciscan missionary and explorer in the center garden - has five thoroughfares. I see the truck parked near the western side of the overpass, and the trailer portion is filled with material. I see some smaller trucks next to it. They all have the name of the city on them, under some sort of civic seal. ""They come up and put your stuff in the back,. And it has a crusher on it, like a garbage truck and they grind it up right in front of you!"" one man told me. ""If you live at the river, they will come with the dozers and dig holes and bury it. And you cannot stop them, or push it into the river,"" another woman told me earlier. I didn't have time to see what this municipal vehicle was up to, nor could I properly identify if there were special mechanisms in the back. I noticed that the groups of people usually here - the temperature is quite comfortable, even in the Bakersfield summers- were absent. Father Garces As I head home, I see I have a few bottles of water left. I stop to offer some to a woman who looks a little too well dressed, standing in front of a shopping cart. She turns away and says ""No, I'm good"". I'm a  bit slighted and  chipped by her refusal, but then I realize she probably has reasons for her suspicions.  And of course, she is a she. I offer another to a man with one leg, trying to push his wheelchair and he shakes his head and ignores me. Again. Then I see a two carts draped with rugs and blankets. I pull up and a man steps out, so does his dog, who jumps up and smells me and moves away. ""She don't bite, she just wants to say hello,"" he tells me, smiling. We talk a bit, and he tells me his story. ""They came by and said 'be out by 12:30 or we'll come and move you'. That's all they do is move you. Move you around and there's no place to go. How come you think there's so many in the city now? Cause they moved them all out from the riverbed where it's safe and we're hidden where you don't have to look at us. You can't go anywhere now and they come along with the trucks..."" I have heard the stories about the bulldozer monsters on the river at night and been told about these mythical vehicles that come in the day time, so at least you can see them. ""All the shelters are filled and they don't got enough space. You need referrals for most of these places unless BPD brings you in."" BPD is the Bakersfield Police. He talks to me about the code enforcement officers, about the business owners who force him to move from in front of buildings even though they're abandoned. ""This one man came out and told me you can't stay here. It wasn't his shop, I was next door and it was burned out and almost demolished. No one could see me. He said I was scaring his customers."" I think about what it must to be a nomad in a modern world. It must be truly maddening. He looks at me and says, ""We all got a plan sometimes we think to dress up in a three piece suit to go in to use a restroom and then when we are done, we change clothes. I've never been discriminated in my life for anything before. It's a double standard."" As I get in my car to leave, I take another look at his tent and the dog he is playing with. I can see another against shelter huddled against the wall, almost too close to the restaurant drive through lane. As I drive home I think of trucks that are hungry enough to devour shopping carts whole. I think of bulldozers raising their arms above the tractor machinery and bringing them down along banks hard enough to create bowels for homes. I think about a world where dogs and people live together in the strange monasteries that hover below freeway overpasses and along the islands in the Kern River. They turn off all the water and lock the restrooms. They plug up all sockets so we can't use them. He was talking about the parks where some took refuge.  There was access to running water once, and the toilets were available.  There were outlets for televisions, microwaves, computers and more. As I wait at the light, I find myself becoming irritated when my signal turns green, but there is still traffic moving through the intersection long after they should have stopped. And then I breathe. no hope in dope This content is accurate and true to the best of the author’s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional. © 2022 Fin"
28,I Truly Hate the Ignorance and Beliefs of the People in My Home State.,politics," Jason has been a long-time resident of Idaho since 1991. He moved here as a transplant from California. This vehicle, recently seen here locally. These are the people we live amongst. Facebook I live in a red, conservative state. You don’t have to drive very far to see Confederate flags hanging from people's homes or vehicles. Not just from trailers. Nice homes. Expensive trucks. You’ll also see Trump/Pence flags. Police Lives Matter flags. Fuck Joe Biden Flags. So many flags. Idaho is one of the fastest-growing states in the nation. We have the beauty of the outdoors all around us. We have four seasons of mostly wonderful weather. And we have a BIG problem with racism, sexism, bigotry, ignorance, homophobia, and xenophobia. You see, Idaho is controlled by religion. We have a large population of Latter-Day Saints, also known as the Mormon Church. So many of the members of this organization are politicians, business owners, and wealthy or well-off people. We also have a large percentage of our population that are Christians. Many of which, in name only. Many of which, the biggest racist, bigoted, hateful hypocrites you could imagine. Idaho’s favorite politician, Donald Trump. That’s him on the left, mocking a disabled reporter. Quora 59.3% of Idahoans voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. 63.9% voted for him again in the 2020 election. Almost 2 out of 3 Idaho citizens approved of his racist, ignorant, angry ranting and ravings, and chose a man with zero political experience as their choice to hold the highest office in our country. The problem I have with all of this is the hypocrisy and ignorance of so many people. Christians are taught some pretty basic things in their beliefs. “Love Thy Neighbor”. “Judge Not, Lest Ye Be Judged Yourself”. “Thou Shalt Not Have Any Other Gods Before Me.” And very few seem to follow those basic commandments to the letter. They treat others who are different from themselves horribly. They openly hate minorities or members of the LGBTQ community for no justifiable reason. They worship Donald Trump as if he was some intelligent, charismatic cult leader. That last one, though. Jim-Bob’s truck here represents all the ugly, hateful things that I’ve come to detest in the 30+ years I’ve lived in this state. It’s truly sad that any time I see a big truck with American flags flying from them, I instantly get the feeling that the person driving is probably racist. Either openly or secretly. That this person would probably hurt my gay daughter if they had a chance. If not physically, with angry, hateful words. Or covertly, by telling nasty jokes or lies. I had a friend who recently put up an LGBTQ Pride flag on their home. It lasted less than 24 hours. Ripped down so violently, it bent the nails in the hardware it was mounted to. This happened on her OWN property. Someone thought they were within their rights to trespass onto her property and yank down her flag that represented support and love for a persecuted community of citizens. Ones who are murdered every year for existing and choosing to love someone of the same gender. Hate is a motherfucker, ain’t it?  Racism is a big problem here. We have openly racist people within our ranks. We have people drawing swastikas around town, on Anne Frank’s monument, on buildings, and other places. Sick bastards who think their trashy, ignorant selves are superior to others only because they are “white”. If your number one source of pride is that you can’t tan worth a shit, you are failing at life. Women often are treated as second-class citizens here in Idaho. Mothers and daughters in many religious families are not equal to their husbands and brothers in their households. Our horrendous governor just passed a bill allowing women to be sued by family members if they abort a baby after 6 weeks. No provisions for children conceived by rape or child abuse. Not that women should NEED provisions. A woman’s body is her choice. Elderly, religious men should NOT be dictating what a woman can or can’t do regarding her own body. Women have every bit as much right to have autonomy over their own bodies as men have over theirs. We have a growing, but still disproportionate percentage of citizens that are people of differing races. You don’t have to look hard to notice that caucasian people outnumber people of color in any given social setting by a LOT. An overwhelmingly huge number of our politicians and lawmakers are white, elderly religious men. We do not represent the minority population in Idaho at all well. My Bride recently was selected for jury duty. They had about 200 people among the prospective jurors for a case involving an African-American man, and guess how many of the possible jurors were black? 20? Lower. 10? Lower. 5? 1? ZERO. She saw a problem with that. A couple of others of the 200 did as well. The rest? They all felt they could be impartial, and didn’t see a problem with not having even one African American person on the jury. Yeah. There’s a reason I often refer to Idaho as “The Mississippi of the Northwest”. And it doesn’t even have much to do with our abysmally low education standards and ratings, similar to the states in the Deep South. It would be easy to generalize that every person driving a truck like this one, or one with a “Let’s Go Brandon” flag flying from it is a racist, bigoted, homophobic piece of shit. But I know that isn’t true. Many of those people are far more covert than that.  This guy loves God, guns, and Freedumb. He’s not a fan of people of color, gays, or books. Reddit Let me be clear: I don’t think every Republican conservative person is racist or bigoted. For every Ted Nugent-listening, mayonnaise sandwich-eating, fucking-their-sister, Nazi piece of filth that is out there, I’m sure there are ten others who are decent, respectable people. People who wouldn’t hurt my gay daughter or her gay and trans friends. People who wouldn’t hurt my Asian Bride and kids. People that might even stand up openly again this kind of ignorance and hate. For those people I am grateful. If you are reading this and feel anger or hatred because of these words I’ve written, GOOD. Think about making a change, if this hits a little too close to home. If you consider yourself a good Christian, then stand behind that book you put so much stock in and take some time to think harder about Jesus’ teachings and messages. Hypocrites with hate in their hearts, people who want to hurt others for simply existing, will not see the kingdom of God. “Depart from me, you workers of iniquity, for I know you not.” Jesus said that. In fact, forget the religious aspect of everything. Why don’t we all just have a little pride and some manners? If you treat others with kindness and respect, most people will return the favor. I miss the days when it was considered poor form to discuss politics and religion. I feel if we kept those things to ourselves, we’d make far fewer enemies and feel far less anger and hatred toward our fellow humans. So let’s turn the volume way down on the constantly angry, overly loud Fox News broadcasts. Turn the Rush Limbaugh reruns off, that guy was a hateful piece of filth and I’m glad he’s dead. In fact, let’s turn off all the news channels and stop reading so many political articles. And for fuck’s sake, certainly stop reading the comments on them. Perhaps we could just get to know our neighbors again. It wouldn’t be so bad to learn something new from someone with a different background than we have, and enjoy humanity before it’s too late.

29,"Good Governance, Gender Equality and Women’s Political Representation",politics," UN Women/Pornvit Visitoran Gender inequality has been a major issue since time and essence and has continued to exist in the contemporary world despite the long battles fought by feminist activists. We all are aware of the proven leadership qualities and abilities of women. Women are good initiators of change and their participation worldwide is very important to achieving sustainable development goals and outcomes. However, the hypocrisy that is still prevailing in this society is continuously restricting women to voice their opinions. Globally women’s representation within national parliaments is less than 20 per cent[1]. Although there has been remarkable progress in women’s representation in political parliament, it is still lower than the desired value. The low representation of women has significantly raised questions about the effectiveness of laws and policies and the failure of international bodies, and conferences on sabotaging gender inequality around the globe. II.	PRESENT SITUATION In order to achieve the goal of women's empowerment and reduce gender inequality, prime importance should be given to the three most important sectors of discrimination. These include education, political participation and employment. Often parents don’t allow their girl child to go to school either because of the conservativeness that is prevailing in the society or their conservative thought process. Even if women take proper schooling, the discriminative society in rural and non-agricultural areas does not give an equal share of wage to women as they give it to their men working in the same place, position and sector. The number of positions given to women is often relatively fewer than those offered to men in various national parliaments as well. Only 25 per cent of all national parliamentarians are women, up from 11 per cent in 1995[2]. Only four countries have 50 per cent or more women in parliament in single or lower houses: Rwanda with 61 per cent, Cuba with 53 per cent, Bolivia with 53 per cent, and the United Arab Emirates with 50 per cent[3].  OxFam Good governance happens when the population of the whole nation is happy and satisfied and all their issues have been addressed. If women’s rights are denied then good governance won’t ever exist. So, women’s ideas and opinions matter in shaping policies and outcomes in order to achieve the agenda of good governance. The 2011 UN General Assembly resolution on women’s political participation reiterated that “women in every part of the world continue to be largely marginalized from the political sphere, often as a result of discriminatory laws, practices, attitudes and gender stereotypes, low levels of education, lack of access to health care, and the disproportionate effect of poverty on women.”[4] In many patriarchal societies, women are often married at a very young age, thus, violating the laws of child marriage. III.	CAUSES OF GENDER INEQUALITY : Get up and goals Why people are allowed to marry their girl child at a young age? Why are girls denied autonomy over their lives? Why women are denied equality? Why is gender inequality not being addressed rigorously at various levels of society? To answer such several questions, one reason would be the futile laws and policies of the country, where laws are made, however, the enforcement mechanism is inadequate thus, rendering the laws to be ineffective. Another reason would be the conservative and patriarchal society which restricts the thoughts of women to such an extent that sometimes they don’t even have the courage to stand and speak up for themselves. Other factors such as poverty, lack of safety mechanisms, inaccessible educational institutions, child marriage and early pregnancy, violence, unequal women's political representation, domestic violence etc. are also factors affecting gender inequality. Often women are denied their right to wear anything they want and are often told to cover up themselves. These stereotypes not only take place in societies but also are present in religious places like temples. In some societies, conservativeness exists to such an extent that crimes like female foeticides are followed by people. IV.	HISTORY OF GENDER INEQUALITY AND WOMEN’S POLITICAL REPRESENTATION History has seen both ups and downs in gender inequality. One such instance was suffrage and the right to suffrage, where women were prohibited from voting in elections. Taking away the right to vote from women was similar to taking away the right to express their opinions. The right to vote for women was granted after many hardships, battles fought by women activists and was granted much later than men. futurelearn In ancient times, the roles of married women were seen as revolving around their family, doing household chores, raising their children and husbands were seen as the prime decision-makers, who earned income and made important decisions. Women, after marriage, were deprived of the right to hold property or retain earnings. All the properties and earnings of women were transferred to their husbands after marriage. Women also were deprived of their inherited rights which included their right to have their share of the business, in case they had an elder or a younger brother and were also not considered coparceners till 2005. Even after marriage all their rights and properties were given to their husbands. A wife’s body was also the possession of the husband, to the extent that – in the eyes of the law – a husband could not rape his wife as her consent, upon marriage, could be assumed[5]. Even, children were considered as the possession of their fathers, irrespective of the fact that all the upbringing of the child was done by mothers. Historically, women had fewer educational opportunities and also the laws at that time were not in support of women. V.	WAYS TO FIGHT GENDER INEQUALITY fairplanet.org Gender inequality, good governance and women's political representation have come up through a long way of struggles, and campaigns from ancient times to today’s era and still have a long way to go. Our history is thankful to women activists like Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, and Frida Kahlo, fearlessly dedicated their lives to fighting for and defending gender equality. Although gender inequality has vanished to a great extent, Today, however, there are still many women suffering right now, which arises the need to further fight against gender inequality. In order to make girls educated, government schools giving free education shall ensure proper education and nourishment of children. Most government schools don’t offer good quality education to students. The system of government schools should be strengthened. Scholarships should also be granted to girls. Laws of the country should be strengthened and strict checking should be conducted on crimes like female foeticide, child marriage etc. Women's employment should be increased and so as their wages. More and more women should be engaged in the fields of politics and laws which also help break the common taboo that ‘women engaged in law and politics find it difficult to marry’ or ‘most people don’t want to marry a woman from the field of law or politics’. NGOs helping to eradicate gender inequality should be promoted. Awareness, by the means of education, should be spread in rural areas and to parents encouraging their girls to participate in various development activities and to help and promote women empowerment and also help societies get rid of their patriarchal thoughts. VI.	CONCLUDING STATEMENTS Why has engendering governance and increasing women's participation in parliament in particular been proved so difficult? The answer to this crucial question lies in understanding the importance of gender equality and the history and the problems associated with gender equality. This article emphasized the importance of women's political participation, gender equality and good governance. It also discussed the ways in which women are suppressed, all around the world and the ways to fight gender inequality. “It is time that we all see gender as a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals”-Emma Watson.

30,To What Extent Is Judicial Activism Desirable in a Constitutional Democracy Like Nigeria?,politics," Seun is an undergraduate student of law in the University of Lagos, Nigeria. TO WHAT EXTENT IS JUDICIAL ACTIVISM DESIRABLE IN A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY LIKE NIGERIA.  Nigeria since her birth has always struggled with the term “constitutional democracy”. The power of the government and its limitation has been a difficult question to answer. The judiciary, an arm of the Nigerian government s.6(6) of the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria has always tried to check the excesses and contain the actions of the legislature and executive. To what extent is the judiciary allowed to use her discretion in matters of checks and balances, enforcement of the doctrine of separation of power and the limitation of the government. Judicial activism real meaning is construed and differs from philosophies and ideologies. Black law dictionary says is a philosophy of judicial decision making, whereby judges allow their personal view about public policy, among other factors, to guide the decisions, usually with the suggestion that adherents of this philosophy tend to find constitutional violations. Judicial activism is that mechanism for exercising judicial power which seeks fundamental re-codification of power relation among dominant institutions of the state, manned by members of the ruling classes, Mohammed Aslam alias Bhure v. India. Similarly,Russell (1989) defined judicial activism as “the judicial vigour in enforcing constitutional limitations on the other branches of government and their readiness to veto those policies on branches of government on constitutional ground”. Given the federal structure of Nigeria Nwabueze (1982) “may be constitutionally invoked to invalidate legislation or executive actions which are inconsistent with the constitution calibres. It is the theory of popular participation of courts in the decision-making process. Nigeria country that has been plagued in the early past by the erosion of military government which impeded on the rights of her citizens as seen an increasing rise of expectation in the judiciary for protection and enforcement of their rights has citizens since 1999. Various ethnicities, culture in Nigeria has looked up to the judiciary intervention to shape the public sphere. The Nigerian judiciary plays a vital role as a social activist. Does the judiciary do enough? But in the stunted young Nigeria progressive democracy, the judiciary role is vital and growing. This role and judiciary intervention depends on the Nigerian constitution. Nigeria operates a written constitution thus the judiciary exercises limited power just as the other arms of government. Section 6(6) of the CFRN establishes and gives function to the judiciary. These functions give the court ability to provide citizens with access to the legislature and executive, enabling them to challenge unpopular and oppressive policies through litigation like the case of A.G(Abia) v. A.G (Federation), also the recent case of SERAP and 176 others v. the federal government. Where the federal government of Nigeria banned the social media web Twitter. The English common law and The United States of America judicial practise has instinctively heavily influenced judicial activism in Nigeria. The origin of judicial activism is linked to the Marburry v. Madison, this landmark case established that the American courts have the power to strike down laws and statutes that they find in violation of the United States. It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Marburry, 177. (38). In other cases Roe v. Wade, United States v. Morison, Lawrence v. Texas. There is no provision in the United States constitution where the power of judicial activism is contained. In Nigeria, the judiciary has come to establish itself as an independent organ of government in the Nigerian democracy. Since the enactment of the 1963 constitution subsequently 1979 and 1999 constitution of Nigeria. Some cases of judicial activism as being evidenced like in Adegbenro v. Akintola, the then governor of the Western region (Adesoji Aderemi) removed chief Akintola from the office of the premier and appointed the defendant. “The law states that the governor shall not remove the premier from office unless it appears to him that the premier no longer commands support of majority members of the house of assembly” The amendment settled the question in favour of the plaintiff; it was to be deemed that he had not been rightfully removed from office and he remained the premier of the region, that was the necessary implication. The defendant recognised that as a valid legal position and at hearing the cost of his application the plaintiff abandoned his appeal from the judgement of the High court. His appeal was dismissed and the question is out of the way. If regard cannot be given to the order in council on the question of who is the rightful premier, no more effect be given to its direction against him to pay costs. The amendment law was intended to deprive the defendant of his costs. Maxwell on the interpretation of statutes, at p.286 of the 10th edition: It is presumed, where the objects of the acts do not obviously imply such an intention, that the legislature does not desire to confiscate the property or encroach upon the right of persons, it will manifest it plainly, if not in express words at least by clear implication and beyond reasonable doubt. There is no mention of the suit, or the parties, or of costs in the amendment law, and in the court's opinion, there is no clear implication that the legislature intended not only to settle a political question but also to deprive the applicant of his costs. In cases like Williams v. Majekodunmi, Council of University of Lagos v. Ademolekeni. The judiciary has since assumed the power to void and nullify on constitutional grounds excesses or inconsistent acts of the legislature and executive. There is a strong rationale to view judicial activism as democratically legitimate in that it provides checks and balances as expected under the separation of powers. Should the constitution allow for more room for judicial activism? Because ultimately the legislature would almost always have the power to re-enact, reverse, modify or even ignore and void a judicial decision. It is also posited that the words in a legal instrument may sometimes be ambiguous, abstract and meaning indeterminate when you apply them stricto sensu or the interpretation of the law requires an intervening act, FRN v. Osahon. Judicial activism is usually required; There is no saying to which extent is judicial activism desirable in a constitutional democracy like Nigeria because presently simply not enough. The legislature sometimes unlawfully intrudes judiciary steps as demonstrated in the popular case of Oputa v. Bababangida. The judiciary should be able to nullify and void laws without interference from other arms of government. See AG Federation v. AG Federation.

31,The Top 29 Videos Explaining Russia's Military Invasion of Ukraine,politics," There’s an incredible plethora of videos and reports put out about the Russo-Ukrainain War every since Russia dramatically escalated the conflict and launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, 2022. This has both great advantages and disadvantages - the sheer flurry of information means that it is possible to have an amount of knowledge on the war which up until a few years ago even intelligence agencies would struggle to possess. But there’s also such an overwhelming amount that it is hard to actually narrow down to what to look at and watch. This is a list of what I view as 20 of the best analyses and videos on the war, looking at it principally from a military perspective, examining operational aspects, the forces available to the two sides, strategy, doctrine, mistakes made, lessons drawn from the war, and its global impact and relevance to other states. Given how the war has evolved dramatically over time, an important thing to look at is the dates of the various videos. Thus, they’re arranged in four periods: the pre-war (prior that is, to the contemporary Russian invasion, and ignoring previous Russian incursions into the Donbass and annexation of Crimea) look, the early invasion (during the failure of the initial Russian invasion during the first few days when it expected that Ukraine would simply fold over), the middle of the invasion (during the period of intense fighting which happened during the Defense of Kiev/Kyiv most notably), and finally since the end of March, with the clear defeat of Russian forces in Kyiv and the decisive shift of operations to the Donbass.  During the pre-war phase, most videos consisted of examining what Russia's reasons might be for attacking Ukraine, and the military composition and capabilities of the two sides. Most assumed that the war would entail heavy strategic costs for the Russian government, but that Russian military strength would be sufficient to enable a conventional defeat of the Ukrainian army, at least east of the Dnieper. As a great look at the actual composition, size, and organization of Ukraine’s military before the war, Battle Order’s video is a great primer to the capabilities of Ukrainian forces. These are somewhat confusing to an outside, since for example a key component of Ukrainian forces are ""air assault brigades,"" which are actually typically mechanized units - similar to Russia with the VDV, who despite being theoretically airborne troops often fight on the ground. It also is very useful at showing the internal composition and structure of Ukrainian units.  One of the fascinating things about the Russian invasion of Ukraine was just how dramatically overestimated were Russian forces. It was widely expected before the war that the Russians would defeat the Ukrainians decisively, utilizing major advantages in equipment, size, and training and operational art to crush Ukrainian forces and at the least seize the eastern half of the country, exploiting pro-Russian sentiments, and during the initial days of the invasion I certainly thought that the Russian invasion would succeed, even if I thought it was still a mistake. Binkov’s Battleground gives what I see as a reasonably middle of the road perspective, before the war, of what the Russian invasion was thought to look like, and thus enables a great compare and contrast. It also examines the intense costs in trade and isolation which Russia would face from the war.  In line with the general question of what it was thought the war might look like before it began, Caspian Report shows a prediction of the Russian assault being based upon a staggered, step-by-step, attack, rather than the singular, massive offensive which expected Ukraine to simply collapse. It both shows what some predictions were from before the war, and what the Russians were looking for in Ukraine.  What I would define as the early war period was most everything up to a bit over after 10 days of the war beginning. This was marked by a Russian invasion which was based upon incredibly faulty intelligence and planning that assumed that the Ukrainians would simply capitulate and so the Russians would simply roll into and occupy the country. At the time, the sheer degree of miscalculation and the nature of this horrific Russian mistake was only beginning to become evident, but the fact that the Russian plan had gone off the rails, if not necessarily to what extent, was starting to become clear. Thus, the first analyses of increased Ukrainian strength and why Russian forces were underperforming to such a degree were starting to appear, although the general expectation was still for a grinding Russian victory would would force Ukraine to capitulate. Principally focusing on Russian spending priorities, this video is however a brilliant perspective on why Russia’s forces have so underperformed despite relatively lavish defense spending, since the Russians have invested in capabilities which have little relationship to their strategic objectives in Ukraine, such as strategic strike forces and the navy. That the Russians invested so much in other fields despite making the decision to invade Ukraine was an unconscionable strategic mistake, and Perun suggests various changes that could have been made to spend Russian military resources better and prepare more effectively for the war. It also explains why the Ukrainians have been so effective, by an effective usage of resources they have and efficient cooperation with NATO support. By day 4 of the invasion, it was already clear that the Russian military was performing far worse than expected. Good Times Bad Times looks at some of the factors involved, such as US intelligence penetration of Russian command, Russia’s bad operational plan, and the perception of Russia’s military strength and options abroad as well as international reactions to Russia’s invasion. While many of Task & Purpose’s claims appear heavily too optimistic from the Russian perspective, such as his prediction of the Russians being able to relatively smoothly transition to an attritional artillery war and continue to make progress against the Ukrainians, it also helps to understand what some of the initial invasion discussion revolved around and to put Russian failures into context. Although much of it focused on the strategic side of the war, The Center for Strategic and International Studies provides a good look at the successes of the Ukrainians early in the war, the disastrous outlook for the Russians in the long run, and shows the evolution of mindsets on Ukrainian performance - a pre-war assumption of military collapse which has by now, in early April, transformed into an assumption of a long term Ukrainian victory, if at grinding cost, with this video coming at a time when it was assumed that the Russians still inevitably would win, even if the cost to do so would be massively higher than the Russians ever imagined. It also provides for a good discussion of hybrid war and intelligence operations, such as Russian attempts to undermine the Ukrainian government pre-war, and cyber-attacks. Although looking at a broad range of issues from sanctions to Russia’s strategic failures on essentially all fronts, this video also provides a valuable understanding of how the US and Western countries aided in transforming and improving the Ukrainian army before the war, as well as, along with other videos, providing a good early war mindset. This is particularly evident in regards to its concern for supporting an eventual insurgency against the Russian occupation of Ukraine. Russia’s initial invasion operations were the start of a long chain of incompetent failings on the part of the Russian military, initially presumed to simply be Ukrainian propaganda but which quickly showed themselves to be all too real. Sub Brief shows some of the crucial deficiencies of Russian formations, such as their incomplete organization with even signal units lacking, the failure to inform soldiers, the poorly chosen time of year which prevented Russian tanks from being able to operate off road, and the failure of the VDV to capture airfields which prevented a rapid Russian offensive push.  Especially during the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one of the most noticeable things on a map was that the Russian attack penetrated into an extensive but relatively shallow belt all around the country. There are other reasons behind it, but one of the big failings during the Russian invasion has been logistics, and Wendover Productions gives a comprehensible and effective analysis of how Russia’s largely railroad-bound logistics failed to enable offensive operations, how the Ukrainians exploited this, and how Russia’s military plans made their shortcomings even more pronounced. When NATO goes to war, it almost always involves massive usage of aerial forces who seize command of the sky, suppress enemy aircraft and air defenses, and are a major component of providing support and assistance to ground forces. Russia’s air force, despite being far larger than the Ukrainian one, has singularly failed to have anywhere near this effect on the battlefield, and Military Aviation History looks at why it has been so ineffective, ranging from training to equipment and the limitations of the Russian defense industry.  After the end of the first week of the war, ever harder questions started to be asked about why the Russian military was failing. This video from Covert Cabal examines the beginning of the period of stagnation that occurred in the Ukraine conflict after the initial offensive push by Russian forces, and recounts the beginning course of the war and some of the key problems afflicting Russian forces, such as corruption, the mud season, and the absence of the Russian air force. We of course, do not know how long the Ukrainian War will go on. I hope sincerely that the horrible and saddening war will end soon, but it is impossible to predict how long it will list. Thus naming this period the ""middle war,"" is a dangerous gamble, but it's the term I've used for the period following the failure of the initial Russian invasion plan, seeking to capture the Ukrainian government and capitulate the Ukrainian government in one fell swoop, to the definitive defeat of Russian forces around Kiev. This period was marked by a semi-stagnation of the war, and a realization of the long-term weaknesses and rot present in the Russian military, as well as some additional analysis of the strategic aspects of the war. An excellent look at the different Russian conceptions of war and its levels, Russian strategic preoccupations, Russian relations with Belarus, potential Russo-Chinese relations, and the development of the Russian military in the future. These international strategic elements are ones which have been much discussed, given that the Russians will almost certainly have to turn more to the Chinese to provide for continued economic vitality, but this video cautions that this will probably not constitute anything close to what might be termed a ""vassal"" arrangement. A discussion video on the Russian forces in Ukraine from the Royal United Services Institute and particularly military analyst Michael Kofman, this video examines the Russian expectations going into the war, current expectations for what future developments the conflict might take, and why Russian military and political capabilities have diverged so badly. Although published in April it actually came from the beginning of March. As the war continued to grind on, it became more and more clear that the Russian military had severe shortcomings and errors. Ward Caroll’s video covers some of the severe problems that the Russians had, such as logistics, precision guided munitions, poor air force technical capacity, and what role NATO supplies had in assisting and aiding the Ukrainians. Reckoning with the disruption of Russian plans and why they failed, Caspian Report looks at why the Russians chose such a poorly conceived strategy and how it turned out so disastrously. Although the situation quickly changed after the video was published as the Russians switched to far greater usage of artillery and bombardments, it shows the faulty logic of the beginning of the war and its results. Another video from Caspian Report comes after the previous one, discussing how the Russians have boxed themselves into a corner and proved to be a strategic disaster for Russia, undermining many of its objectives and interests. Examining the role of different anti-aircraft systems and what differences exist between ex-Soviet and NATO conceptions of air defense, this video explores what can be done to help Ukrainian air defense and how it works in general.  One of the most valuable sources on what has been happening in Ukraine has been videos posted from combat, principally on the Ukrainian side. While these are definitely useful, this video examines the limitations on this and how they can show different perspectives on each side, as well as some of the important sides for operational security and war crimes. During the early days of the invasion, one of the ideas which emerged to try to explain the terrible Russian performance in the war was that the Russians were sending in waves of poorly trained and constituted conscripts, and were preserving the regular units behind them to exploit their success. It’s easy to see whence this view came, since the Russian military was universally, including by the Russian government itself, expected to be far more competent, but it is, as Perun shows, wrong. The Russians are not fighting the war with one hand tied behind their back. This video explores the positioning and organization of units on both sides at around the middle of the war. While the proposals about what could be done by the Ukrainian army are entirely the author’s opinions, and I generally don't like that style of video, it gives a good perspective on what the battlefield looks like operationally. One of the big questions in the war has been the extremely poor performance of the Russian air force. Part of the explanation behind it is provided by Military History not Visualized, who examines the poor supplies of precision munitions available to the Russian air force and the state of broader munition supplies. The usage of drones has been a key factor in military transformations over the last several decades. Although started by the Americans with drone strikes during the War on Terror, since then their effect on the battlefield has only grown, providing major increases in strike, reconnaissance, and SEAD capabilities, shown notably during the Nagorno-Karabagh War and now during the War in Ukraine. Although not entirely unexpected in light of problems with armored units in recent wars in Yemen, Syria, and Armenia, the Ukrainian War has shown in painful light the limitations of armored forces against contemporary weapons. Perun examines the increasing threats facing tanks on the modern battlefield, puts them into historical perspectives, and discusses what can be effectively done to limit them and what future changes can be made to tank forces, as well as showing the Russians proved to be so particularly vulnerable.  One of the greatest concerns about the Ukrainian conflict is that it could escalate as far as a nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia. Caspian Report’s video on this examines the role of nuclear weapons in Russian doctrine, potential deployment mechanizations, authorization, and likelihood of use. The big break in the war so far, and the decisive closure of the initial stage, came with the defeat of Russian troops in front of Kiev, and their forced withdrawal from the city. Not only did this end the Russian threat to Kiev and end any Russian hopes of regime change in Ukraine, it also meant that the Ukrainians had shown that they could defeat the Russians in conventional, stand-up fights - most notably when the Ukrainian 93rd Mechanized Brigade crushed the Russian 4th Tank Division, an elite Russian armored formation. With this, the epicenter of the war has shifted to the Donbass, which is still ongoing. Binkov’s video explains what the alternate sources of manpower are for the two sides and why Russia struggles to put enough troops into the field, and the long term expectations of what the manpower situation will look like for both. In line with other recent videos, an increasing focus has come to be placed upon the attritional side of the fight, particularly manpower, which for both sides is a crucial element. This video shows the important role which Ukrainian reservists and the civilian population have played in assisting the regular Ukrainian army and what services they have rendered both on and off the battlefield, with a comparison to the limitations which Russia’s limited war imposes. Coming at the turn of the war with the defeat of Kiev, this looks at why and how Russian forces were defeated in the North, the shift to the Donbass, ongoing offensives north of Kherson, and some elements of the ongoing Battle of Mariupol. The big change recently in the war has been that the Russian offensive nexus has shifted to the Donbass, with the withdrawal of their troops from the north. Task & Purpose talks about how the Russians have spun this defeat in the north and what sort of objectives and interests they have in the new southern offensives.

32,A Response to the Gabriel Fernandez Case: in Defense of Social Workers,politics," Fin lives in California's Central Valley and is interested in social issues. Disclaimer This is just a piece I wrote awhile back in response to the film The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez which talked about the case of child abuse involving the boy inamed in the title and the social workers involved in the case.  It is only an opinion piece and any facts referred to should be verified before given any further considerations. For more ifnormation, see the References at the end of the story. The four accused The murder of Gabriel Fernandez, an 8-year-old boy, was an event that happened in city of Palmdale and involved four of Los Angeles County’s Department of Family and Children’s Services (DFCS), social workers.  The case itself was one that centered around terrible forms of abuse and resulted in the conviction of the mother and her boyfriend.  The mother received life in prison while the father was given the death penalty. One of the major concerns that came out of this case was the fact that many in the public – as well as the LA County District Attorney – felt there were people in the social services department who were responsible for the young boy’s death.  Four of these  – two supervisory social workers and two social work employees – were tried on child abuse and falsifying public records in the death of young Fernandez.  While there are many in the arena of public opinion who believe that the DFCS should be held liable in this situation, there are numerous other factors which the general public doesn’t understand that must be taken into consideration. According to their website, the mission of the DFCS is “The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services promotes child safety and well-being by partnering with communities to strengthen families, keeping children at home whenever possible, and connecting them with stable, loving homes in times of need.” (DFCS, 2020).  A couple of the key terms to be taken from that statement are “to strengthen families” and “keeping children home whenever possible”.  The county’s goal is to preserve the family unit and to maintain connection between the children and their birth parents.  This is a philosophy that seems compatible with maintaining a healthy society since many social problems can be associated with the broken family. During the documentary film, The Murder of Gabriel Fernandez, interviews are done with those who are associated with DFCS and the point that the goal of the department is to “keep families together” is clearly made. Even in situations where there is turmoil or conflict within the family unit, social work professionals recognize the value of working towards homeostasis and that the removal of children from the household can cause trauma to the child, perhaps even greater harm than the original forms of neglect or abuse. Most of the actions or enforcements practiced by social workers are guided by policy and law. Differential responses (DR) are permitted to an extent, by California state policies within child welfare practices. Differential responses are designed to allow a reasonable degree of flexibility and permit the worker to use their own judgement and discretion while handling a case. According to the department of social services:  Differential response, also called alternative response, encourages community agencies to participate in supporting families who are considered low risk, allowing child protection services to focus on the more serious cases in which abuse and neglect have been confirmed. This approach recognizes that variations in families' needs and strengths require different approaches. Assessments are done to help agencies develop strategies for identifying child and family needs and concerns and tailor its response accordingly.  In the trial, highlighted in the film, four social workers: Kevin Bom, Stefanie Rodriguez, Gregory Merritt, and Patricia Clement, had charges filed against them by the District Attorney, J. Lacey. According to court documents, “The People charged petitioners with felony child abuse (Pen. Code, § 273a, subd. (a)) and falsifying public records (Gov. Code, § 6200). At a preliminary hearing, the magistrate held them to answer the charges.” (People v. Bom, et al., 2020). Originally, in the Superior Court, they were found guilty of the charges against them, but the appeals court reversed those claims. The claim of “felony child abuse” seems to be the most substantial count against the four and implies direct responsibility for the actions of Fernandez’s mother and boyfriend. For one who isn’t familiar with the duties, obligations and practices of those who work in the social work field, the case might seem cut and dry and that the responsibility is with the DCFS.  Popular culture portrays social workers as people who charge into people’s homes and remove children.  In reality, that is one of the last things a social worker wishes to do.  There are other options which are held higher that include maintaining the family unit and trying to work towards family reunification when possible. These options, were at best, hinted at in the film and the social workers, other than a brief interview with Merritt and some philosophical talk by administrators, did not speak. What was said by the workers who did talk, was that they were doing their jobs and performing their duties within the scope of the profession. One of the obvious questions that come to mind, is how sound was the judgement used by those workers who were associated with Fernandez.  HIPPA policies prohibit any patient details and are designed to protect the client as well as the social worker.  DR offers the option of personal judgement – in this case it seems that the desire to maintain the family unit, superseded other pressing concerns – and professional guidance. What seems more disconcerting, is if the phrase “supporting families who are considered low risk, allowing child protection services to focus on the more serious cases” which is taken directly from the DFCS page leads to two troubling speculations:  1) The social workers were not aware as to the extent of Fernandez’s situation; 2) There were more serious cases than the Fernandez one which were the focus of the social workers attention.  The only other option, which is available, is that the social work professionals were indifferent to Fernandez and basically, did not care. Other considerations to keep in mind are the fact that Gabriel’s teacher contacted the DFCS numerous times, notifying them of the abuse.  A security guard in a county office contacted the authorities to warn them of things he had seen in Gabriel that he (the guard) found disturbing.  There were other persons – family members even – who made efforts to intervene on Gabriel’s behalf.  These facts contribute to the idea that Gabriel was obviously in danger and that his situation was brought before the county authorities.   What exactly was made known to the social workers in question, isn’t completely revealed in the film. These facts, along with the details of the Fernandez situation, make this a difficult case to analyze.  An observer – as well as the LA County – district attorney obviously felt someone should have intervened in the situation.  The social worker were the fall guys.  Another perspective suggests the need to maintain the family unit.  Families after all, are the backbones of a healthy society.  Children, it is believed, are better off with the people who brought them into the world. Clearly, there is no simple answer.  Just a sad case – one of many:  two adults displaced because of a mistake made, a little boy gone, four social workers whose lives were influenced, and countless other family members who have been traumatized.

33,The Notorious ‘Jack the Ripper’ of India,politics," Ravi loves writing within the cusp of relationships, history, and the bizarre, where boundaries are blurred and possibilities are immense. Raman Raghav, India's most horrifying serial killer was rightly called the ‘Jack the Ripper’ of India GQ-India-raman-raghav He was like anyone in those millions of middle-class men going about eking a living in the busy metropolis of Mumbai. Holding an umbrella to guard against the unpredictable Mumbai rains, well-groomed in a simple sort of way with hair neatly combed behind and the faint fragrance of coconut oil coming from his body, he also appeared a bit fastidious by carrying a mirror which he would look into every few minutes. Except that he wasn’t an ordinary man. He was called ‘Raghav the Ripper’, India’s own version of ‘Jack the Ripper’. Calling Raman Raghav India’s most notorious serial killer would be an understatement. He was the killer who singlehandedly brought a busy metropolis to its toes, casting a spell of fear and paranoia all over the city. In just three years in the 1960s, Raman’s killing spree forced the complete shutdown of a city with people preferring to stay indoors rather than being bludgeoned to death by him. And his favorites were the poor people, the slum dwellers, and the pavement dwellers who slept in the open. He used a regular steel rod to break skulls and faces mercilessly. Between 1965 and 1968 in two phases, Raman is believed to have killed at least 40 people at various locations in the city. His fear assumed such mammoth proportions that rumors started spreading that the killer possesses supernatural powers and can kill at ‘will’. His character has been immortalized in the 2016 Bollywood movie Raman Raghav 2.0, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the bloodthirsty serial killer. His character has been immortalized in the 2016 Bollywood movie Raman Raghav 2.0, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui as the bloodthirsty serial killer. raman-raghav-2-0 The Mumbai police first observed the killings in 1968. A series of murders had happened in the western suburbs of the city and all the murders were of slum-dwellers and the poor living in derelict hutments, isolated shanties, and pavements. All had been attacked by a ‘heavy and blunt instrument’ cracking their skulls and faces. The police knew they have a serial killer at hand. The killer was messy as if taunting the police; there were blood spatters in the huts, beds covered with human brain matter, floors covered with blood, and even faces repeatedly disfigured into pulp. It was as if the killer was attacking in a frenzy of madness. As the killer reached his 20th victim, fear started enveloping the vibrant city. Rumors about a serial killer with superhuman powers spread. Some said he could turn into any animal he wanted, some claimed to have seen him sleeping upside down from trees. There were several incidents where panicky crowds started attacking suspicious-looking homeless people and beggars mistaking them for the killer. Fear was everywhere as the city went into lockdown mode with no one daring to step out after dark. The police were under immense pressure to find the killer fast. Retired Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Alex Fialho is credited for the arrest of dreaded serial killer Raman Raghav in Mumbai in 1968 raman-raghavs-arrest-secvpf-1605417535 In that very year, Mumbai police got a new young chief of crime branch Ramakant Kulkarni. The serial killer’s case came to him as he began to painstakingly examine any pattern emerging from past killings of this sort. His observations brought him to similar killings that took place 2 years ago in 1965-66 in the eastern suburbs of Bombay, where 19 people had been attacked. At that time one homeless man named Raman Raghav had been arrested by the police for questioning. But the charges were never proved and he is released. Ramakant was sure that Raman is the killer and he is back again. A 2000-strong police manhunt was launched across the city. Raman’s photo was given to every member of the task force who started to comb meticulously every nook and corner of the city. His photo was circulated in the press asking the public for help and information. It was a mammoth task in a mammoth city and chances of finding Raghav were bleak unless he makes a mistake. And that was what he did. He carried a wet umbrella when it is not raining in South Mumbai raising the suspicions of sub-inspector Alex Fialho who says. “I don’t know what made me look at him. Those days I used to carry photographs of the serial killer, Raman Raghav, in my shirt pocket. As I was waiting for a bus, I saw this well-built man in khaki shorts and a long blue bush shirt walking in my direction. I noticed he was carrying a wet umbrella. As it had not rained in South Bombay, I asked him where he was coming from and he replied Malad (a place in western suburbs where killings had happened). This strengthened my doubt. He was also carrying half-rimmed spectacles and a thimble that belonged to a tailor who had been found killed in Malad a couple of days ago.” He arrested him and brought him to the police station. Raghav was finally caught on 27 August 1968. Raghav was finally caught on 27 August 1968. 810462-korwmhjqcc-1466624741 He was a tough nut crack and despite rigorous questioning and torture, he did not open his mouth. Then Ramakant hit upon an idea. He asked him what does he like the most. Raghav asked for Chicken biryani, a comb, hair oil, and a mirror. All his items were given to him and finally, after having his fill, Raghav asked. “Now tell me, what do you want?” He confessed his crime and also gave the hiding place of his activities where the police found an iron rod covered with blood and hair, knives, a screwdriver, his ‘loot’ from the murders, a colored napkin, a torch, an umbrella, and a stove. Raghav was sentenced to be hanged but later on, his sentence was changed to life imprisonment due to his mental condition of chronic paranoid schizophrenia. He was lodged at Yerwada Jail in Pune and died at Sasson hospital from kidney failure in 1987. Raghav’s crime was declared by the three-member jury bench as ‘unparalleled and unsurpassed in the history of crime’.

34,Running Scared of Putin in Ukraine,politics," Recent polling does show the President Biden's handling of the war in the Ukraine has failed. Over 50% of Americans think this. Foreign policy was supposed to be Biden's strength in the election, I mean, I voted for him. He has proven to be an old man in fear of Putin. Don't get me wrong, he has done great things like keep NATO united 100%, forged a real bond to thwart Russia that no doubt has shocked Putin. But the shock has worn off. Biden has provided the Ukrainian army millions of dollars of good military equipment, like the Javelin and Switchblade drones that can attack tanks. I am sure he has provided other solid equipment Ukrainian soldiers use on the daily basis that enhance their performance. But at the same time, Biden and NATO are dragging their feet on the equipment Zelensky continues to ask for like S-300 systems, MiG-28 aircraft, T-72 tanks and APCs. Why is this? They are running scared of what Putin might do. It has been like this since Feb. 24th when the war began. They tiptoe around trying not to offend the great Putin because he alarms them with talk of using chemical weapons or tactical nuclear missiles. Meanwhile, war crimes are being uncovered daily like those 400+ civilians killed in Bucha. More Buchas will come as the war enters a new more deadly phase when Russia tries to take more of the Donbas and Dnipro. The horrors are only beginning. And yet, what does Biden and NATO do? They condemn, threaten war trials, threaten to remove them from the UN. As if Putin really cares, LOL. There is only one thing on his mind-victory to save face after his plan to take Kyiv utterly failed by stiff Ukrainian resistance. Putin will pull out all the stops to win now. He probably will use chemical weapons if the new attack begins to fail again. He may even use ONE tactical nuclear weapon. Biden and NATO use of words to Putin is like talking to the wall or a teenager who refuses to listen. Biden had said that the use of chemical weapons would cause the US\NATO to some response. Short of military response, Putin will no doubt call his bluff. If not military, what economic isolation with more sanctions? If the war crimes in Bucha was not a redline for NATO\Biden, what the hell is? So far, both have just used the usual words in condemning it and support of Ukraine, which I am sure Zelensky is sick of hearing. Words are cheap, action is expensive. Zelensky is correct that if nothing more than words is the West's reaction to the war crimes in Bucha, then, the UN and NATO are powerless against a bully and should be dissolved. Ukraine needs weapons and more than their getting. That is the only thing that is going to stop Putin now. The sanctions still have not yet crippled Russia and all the targeting of individuals close to Putin has nil impact. The oil shipments still are happening and Russia makes millions from it. Isolating Russia is not very effective because of China, Iran, India and others. Sanctions are too slow for a fast moving war where events change in a day. Biden and NATO need to look in the mirror and not see Putin! Together, they are so much stronger than Russia's fumbling military and yet they act scared of the boogey-man. Already, some NATO countries do see the light and are sending dozens of T-72 tanks and APCs to Ukraine. Others, may be supplying the S-300 anti-aircraft system. Poland still could send the 28 MiG-28 fighters but for Biden who is in the way. But, time is of the essence and it is running out before Putin begins the final Donbas offensive. Biden and NATO have been running scared. What will happen if Putin tosses one missile into NATO territory? First, Russia will say its an error or missile that went off course and apologize. Then, Biden and NATO will walk back his statement that if once inch of NATO is attacked, NATO will send units in to Ukraine. Does anyone actually believe this? Maybe, Biden might send one cruise missile to prove a point into Russia. Would he dare? I think he would be too scared. But look at what the Ukrainians did: they flew two gunships into Russia some 30 miles from the border and destroyed an oil depot! While nobody claimed it, attacking Russia did not provoke Putin and it did not create WW3. Putin is willing to push the envelope with Biden and NATO because he does not fear them as much as they fear him. It is really time to ""get some balls"" and face-off with Putin in small steps. That is how war is. But sending in American troops will never happen unless NATO joins in."
35,The Apocalyptic Illegality of Face Mask Mandates in the United States,politics," A growing distrust in the most promoted medical and legal authorities has driven me to do my own research on COVID-19 face masks. My references (linked within this article) lead me to conclude that face mask mandates in the United States are more than unjust. They are provably illegal. The best evidence , without question, fails to support public health policies that force people to wear face masks.Cooperative arrangements between government agencies, professional journals, and news media have enabled the proliferation of poor-quality (frequently illegitimate) research. High-quality (legitimate) research that should be the benchmark for public health policy making has been misrepresented, censored, or concealed.Any mask mandate, therefore, compels U. S. residents to follow and advertise the flawed reasoning of poor-quality research that has been wrongly raised to the level of policy-grade evidence. Government leaders engaged in these cooperative arrangements to promote inferior research are suppressing rational, balanced thought that gives rise to good judgment in determining individual health behaviors.Forced masking compels faulty, incomplete thinking that constrains free expression of individual judgment, which differentiates between legitimate evidence and illegitimate evidence. Forced masking, therefore, compels symbolic speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Businesses or organizations that deny admittance to places of public accommodation or deny services to healthy people (with zero clinical symptoms) for not wearing a face mask are state actors privately enforcing wrongful state decrees under the color of law, which exposes these businesses or organizations to liability under ................ 42 U.S.Code § 1983 -- Civil Action for Deprivation of Rights. Face mask mandates are acts of authority that literally attempt to force people to think and act in ways that defy physical facts. Data from all over the world proves the absurdity of these mandates. Data analyst, Ian Miller, has written an entire book about it.Below, I present just four of Miller's many examples from around the globe that plainly illustrate how face mask mandates glaringly fail to reduce COVID-19 cases and deaths: The chart for South Korea features a bold red line at above 95% mask compliance for the entire country, spanning over two years (2021-2022). During this two-year span, deaths attributed to COVID-19 (indicated by the bold black line) remained very low, for ten months (from Jan 2021 to about Oct 2021), which suggests that face masks were keeping deaths low. But, even with vaccine passports in place on Nov 1 2021, and still with over 95% mask compliance, the number of COVID-19 deaths began to rise, spiking briefly, declining briefly, but then skyrocketing at the beginning of 2022. With 95% of South Korea using face masks, in addition to there being vaccine passports on top of this, COVID-19 deaths eventually went through the roof anyway. Neither masks alone nor masks in combination with vaccine passports stopped the huge rise in deaths attributed to COVID-19. Masks never worked to reduce the number of COVID-19 deaths. The mere superficial association of mask use with low death rates for an arbitrary amount of time was never sufficient causal proof of mask effectiveness. Things were never this simple, and assuming that things were this simple was unscientifically naive. The virus was proceeding in its own rhythm, despite efforts to control it, and enough time had to pass to reveal this truth. The chart for Germany shows a bold, black, irregular line spanning Jan 2020 to March 2022, with peaks and valleys indicating the rise and fall in number of COVID-19 daily new cases over this span. A bold orange line starts to appear near the end of 2020, which indicates the percentage of the entire population fully vaccinated on a given date.Notice, in April of 2020, a countrywide mask mandate (with fines) was in effect, and, as with South Korea, for about five months afterwards, the number of new COVID-19 cases was low, suggesting mask effectiveness.  But then the number of cases started to rise, which drove Germany to institute a medical mask mandate on January 20 2021, as if a better mask would be more effective than previous masks that somehow seemed to magically stop working. Again, the number of cases seemed to decrease, as if the stricter mask mandate was the cause.  It was not the cause -- it was yet another result of naive, unscientific reasoning that assigned causation to simple correlation. Just because two things appear related on the surface does not mean that they are. Time always reveals the fallacy of this sort of thinking. Even as a greater percentage of Germany's total population became fully vaccinated, while the latest medical mask mandate still applied on top of this, the number of COVID-19 cases eventually skyrocketed. At the peak of Germany's skyrocketing case numbers, nearly 90% of the entire adult population was fully vaccinated, and the medical mask mandate was still in effect.  Yet, the simultaneous 90% fully vaccinated rate and medical mask mandate did not stop the virus from progressing in its own rhythm.Masks never worked to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases. The chart for Austria is probably the most striking example of mask-mandate failure, since it shows a country that mandated N95 respirators to no avail.  Again, the bold black line with peaks and valleys indicates the rise and fall in number of COVID-19 daily new cases over the period from January 2020 to January 2022. As in the previous two examples, an initial mask mandate gave the superficial appearance of reducing the number of COVID-19 cases, only to be proven ineffective, when the number of COVID-19 cases spiked steeply, months after progressively stricter mandates came into effect, driving Austria's government (like Germany's government) to introduce an even stricter mask mandate, on top of vaccine passports, which did nothing to prevent skyrocketing cases a few months later.  Even the N95 mandate, on top of vaccine passports, on top of locking down the unvaccinated, never stopped steeper skyrocketing COVID-19 case numbers in January 2022, two months after all these harsh measures were in place simultaneously. My final example, the chart for New York County (like the previous charts) shows three categories of data, spanning October 2021 to February 2022. The black curve shows daily new COVID-19 cases per hundred thousand people. The red curve shows the percentage of the population wearing masks, and the orange line shows the percentage of the population fully vaccinated.Notice that 80% to 90% of the entire population used face masks the whole time, while, simultaneously, over 80% of the entire population was fully vaccinated. From October 2021 to about December of 2021 (two months where both these measures were in force), COVID-19 daily new cases were very low, which a naive person might attribute to masks and vaccines. As in previous examples, however, such an attribution would be wrong, because, under these same measures, daily new COVID-19 cases skyrocketed from December 2021to January 2022. This large spike happened when face mask compliance and vaccination compliance were reaching their highest percentages.Notice, again under these same measures, how daily new COVID-19 cases dropped as fast as they had spiked, as if masking and vaccination had zero effect. In other words, these measures, even in combination, failed to prevent a spike in cases. The low cases before the spike, the high cases during the spike, and the low cases after the spike occurred while mask compliance and vaccine compliance were at or above 80% for the entire population for the entire time under consideration.As in the previous three examples, face masks never worked to reduce daily new COVID-19 cases. These examples reveal only the tip of the iceberg. Numerous other charts show the same trends everywhere, at the international, national, state, and regional levels. Face masks have made no difference in reducing COVID-19 cases or deaths. Why, then, have government leaders continued to insist on using them?A rational person can only conclude that some other purpose besides public health is driving mask mandates, since the physical facts are plainly available, where people in leadership positions have access to these facts and should reasonably be informed of these facts. Determining the legality of mask mandates requires strict scrutiny as to whether they serve a compelling government interest. Mask mandates plainly fail to satisfy this standard of legal scrutiny.Healthy individuals with zero clinical symptoms of illness are not clinically infected and pose negligible (arguably no) risk of spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus that allegedly causes COVID-19. Yet, mask mandates apply to both healthy and symptomatic individuals without regard for risk and effectiveness.The government interest in enacting face mask mandates is to protect public health. In the context of COVID-19, this means that mask mandates would reduce the number of cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19. As the previously discussed data shows, however, mask mandates fail to show reduction in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Consequently, mask mandates fail to serve the government interest in enacting them.The government's interest in ending the epidemic is simply not advanced by forcing widespread use of ineffective masks to address negligible risks. Face mask mandates, therefore, are properly judged as illegal. None of the statutes or regulations being cited for authority to declare mask mandates authorize the CDC or anyone to make or enforce regulations that amount to a blanket preventative measure against people who may or may not be carrying an infectious disease.Any claim of authority to impose mask mandates under 42 U. S. Code § 264(a) fails to interpret the language of the statue properly. Nothing in the statute's language describing the types of allowed measures relates to enacting measures for people whose infection status is unknown. The statute applies to situations where a person can reasonably be known to be infected. Not knowing a person's infection status and treating the person as infected anyway is unreasonable. Treating a person who shows zero clinical symptoms of any disease as a disease threat is, again, unreasonable. There would be no question about the absurdity of treating a person feared to be a murderer as a murderer in fact, when the person had committed zero acts of murder. There would be no question about the absurdity of treating a person as a child molester, when there was zero manifestation of the behavior of a child molester in the person. Treating a person as as a disease threat, when the person manifests zero symptoms of disease is equally absurd. Day to day life in a shared society does not operate on the basis of what might or might not be (fear) -- it operates on trust in what we can actually know in the moment (reasonable faith). Treating healthy people as threats of disease does not follow from the language of 42 U.S.C. § 264(a). Only a gross misreading of the statute (or a gross exaggeration of parts of the statute's wording that are vague) could result in such an erroneous interpretation. Furthermore, asserting and upholding a disease control measure that real-world data unquestionably falsifies is indefensible. Allowing face mask mandates of any kind to continue, therefore, amounts to catastrophic degradation of the legal system and a constitutional death blow. Here is a pdf version of this article."
36,Information Processing - Getting the News in the 21st Century,politics," Robin Olsen has lived for half a century. No experience is a bad experience unless we learn nothing from it. Many choices but only three flavors in reality Does the news get you down today? Does it all seem like so much flash in the pan? Remember when the news used to inform us of what was going on? That was some time ago now, wasn’t it? In my lifetime I have seen the news transformed from a straight forward broadcast of relevant information into a Broadway side show complete with flashy props and actors instead of journalists. How did this happen? Well, one of the biggest problems today is the fact that news media outlets have to compete for ratings as if they were nothing more than a sitcom channel or a cartoon channel. A news outlet should never have to compete for ratings as this means they have to compete with entertainment products in order to stay on the air. This leads the outlets and networks to become flashier in their presentations and to exaggerate the stories themselves. It even leads to things like ‘crisis actors’ and simply made up stories, what we call fake news today. This destroys the trust in, and integrity of, the information being delivered. Who really knows what is real and what is not? The second big problem actually stems from the first and that is the general public demand to be entertained while informed. Consider two potential newspaper headlines; one states that a 5 year old girl has gone missing but after an extensive search she is found alive and well, the other states the same girl but she is found dismembered in a trash bin. Which headline would sell more newspapers? The sad answer is the second one would. When you combine this consumption pattern with the need to gain ratings in order to stay relevant and make a fair profit one can see the environment for fake news stories, and not just by the ‘big outlets’. It is a systemic corruption that has contaminated the public’s only real source for information. The third big problem is government interference. I won’t delve too much into this topic as it is very complex, suffice it to say that all governments try to influence their media and most succeed. Seeking out multiple sources does not make you a 'conspiracy nut' There are ways to combat this though, if not for ‘the truth’ then for no other reason than to keep your stress levels down and sanity intact. Simply turn off the television. That is not as strange as it sounds. Televised news broadcasts use paid actors as anchors in order to help present the information in very specific and manipulative manners. It takes an actor, not a journalist, to do that effectively. One can see this by how often these ‘experts’ on networks such as FOX and CNN are called upon to appear in movies. 30 years ago one would never see an actual television anchor appearing in a Hollywood movie production but today it is common. Turn it off, at least for general news broadcasts and information, you can still keep it around for entertainment, that’s what it was meant for in the first place. Instead of watching the news, read about it instead. All the big networks run their own websites with written versions of every big story and most even have local sections for news and information in your own area. By reading it instead of watching it you can avoid the glamour and glitz that the networks wrap their news broadcasts in and presents the information to you in a much calmer environment. The relevant videos are all on the websites as well (actual on the scene footage, not broadcasts) so they can be watched without the color commentary provided by the big network’s ‘team of experts’. It is far less stressful to get information this way than by visually absorbing it. The internet also allows the public to read and review stories from a wide assortment of sources, both national and international, and one should definitely take advantage of that. Getting all your information from one source only leaves one open to being deceived and manipulated. The story you hear is never the ‘full story’. Social media is not a source of relevant information as none of those stories are source checked and many are blocked simply to help control specific narrative. Even ‘eye witness’ accounts and pictures posted on social media sites have been often times proven fake so it is important to choose one’s sources wisely. I usually review all important stories in the press from at least 5 different websites. In the age of the internet, exclusives do not happen. So if a ‘big story’ only appears on one site then it is most likely a false story. Truly big stories will be covered from all angles, the rest are basically local stories that one should not get worked up about unless they live in that local, or they are fake or misleading. Stories do not have to contain false information to be fake, any story that is written in such a way as to elicit a negative emotional response should be treated as suspect. Most of those stories lack all the facts, or the facts have been exaggerated and/or are unproven, this is required to elicit the correct response. So read the stories, don’t watch them and study all the angles and sources to get as close as one can to the truth of the matter. In the end remember that, unless you have the ability to research the validity of a story and it’s sources on your own (most of us do not have that ability) what you choose to believe or not regarding information coming from the media is an act of faith nothing more.

37,"Youth Offender Laws, Rehabilitation and Release: Is It Fair?",politics," Fin lives in California's Central Valley and is interested in social issues. Disclaimer I am not licensed to practice law.  What is written below is strictly my interpretation and opinions on what is mentioned in the title.  If you require any further assistance, please contact a legal professional.  Nothing written below should be seen as advice. When I write about the Youth Offender Laws in this article, I am specifically referring to the action in California, although most states have adopted similar measures. Youth offender laws basically state that a person who was sentenced for a crime that was committed by an offender while under the age of (now it's) 26 can petition for re-sentencing or even to be released on parole. This was inspired by studies that determined the human brain does not fully develop until an individual reaches the age of 26. Because of this (scientific) fact, young people are more prone to negative influences that might have led to them committing the crime and/or are unable to properly regulate their impulse control instincts. One of the cases that set precedence for this legislature was Miller v. Alabama.  In 2012, the Supreme Court determined that life without parole (LWOP) sentences for those under 18 was unconstitutional.  This was a form of cruel and unusual punishment because juveniles possessed, ""diminished culpability and heightened capacity for change"".  As things progressed over the years, the age was raised to 26 and other factors such as sentence length and the nature of the offense came into play.  Adult offenders who fall under specified conditions, and whose controlling offense occurred while the inmate was under the age of 26, may be eligible for a parole hearing.  This doesn't mean the courts will set them free, but under the proper eligibility guidelines, a defendant may initiate a petition for release.  Unfortunately, the American Justuce System is just riddled with lies and inconsistencies — Tommy Chong Initially when the ruling from the Supreme Court was official in 2012, the law only applied to those who were convicted as minors. This set a precedence and and the law eventually evolved to include older young adults. It should be understood that these measures are a process and not an automatic guideline. An incarcerated defendant does not gain automatic release because their offense was committed when the inmate was a juvenile. Instead he or she must petition the court, provide evidence, and show just cause in order to even be considered for removal from custody. The procedures themselves can take several years and it is possible that the time it takes to move through the courts, can exceed the petitioner's earliest possible release date. The following was taken from The youth Offender Parole Hearings Fact Sheet released by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR). One of the concerns that many in the public would have about such measures is that dangerous inmates may be released back into the community where the possibility exists that more crimes may be committed. In addition, there are those who read these laws as possibly providing lenience or even a removai from culpability for youth to continue in their criminal activity. Although those may be valid concerns, there is a level of hypobole in the responses to these new bills. In general, when one considers the crimes that inspire long sentences or LWOP, one understands that there is a level of extreme violence behind those crimes.  Most LWOPs receive their punishments as a result of murder, armed robberies where there was some serious or grave bodily injury (SBI or GBI), or that of habitual career criminal. Offenses related to sex crimes are usually excluded from consideration, although there are variations, depending upon circumstances relevant to the perpetrator, victim and the court who heard the case. This level of subjectivity is ubiquitous in law and even though there are standards in sentencing guidelines, the interpretation and application of law itself is subject to human error. In order to try and make sense of this new view on prison reform, it is imperative that the reader examine the reasons behind Miller v. Alabama and that is the understanding that with age comes wisdom. With harsher sentences and measures such as the three strikes law, prisons in California became overcrowded. Not only were there many younger people finding themselves incarcerated; a significant portion of the prison population was growing old (and dying) behind bars. Many of the youth who entered the system were of course, from disadvantaged backgrounds. according to social scientists. Most are from poverty and under-educated, many are from racial minority populations. This fact certainly should not be an excuse for the events that landed them into the position in which they are in. However, it should be understood the effect that this has on the communities from which these prisoners come. Does it really serve to any advantage to remove young men and women from our cities for decades? Will the victims - the families of those victimized as well - ever recognize any true recompense? In addition, the cost of incarceration - housing, health care, education programs etc. - is exorbitant when measured over decades. For some, this is home In 2004, the California Department of Corrections (CDC) became the CDCR (the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation).  Ultimately the purpose of the reformatory (another name for prison) was not just to punish, but to rehabilitate.  Correct and change.  The question from this is, do prisons really provide rehabilitation?  Can an inmate change their criminal thinking and become a self-supporting, model citizen? Does anyone really care about this idea?  Most law abiding citizens probably do not.  I haven't done an official survey, but I am under the impression that most people feel if someone commits a murder, that the violator should have his or her life taken from them as well.  Either through the death penalty, or permanent removal from society. This makes sense to me as well.  Particularly when the victim is someone who is not involved in any gang related activity, when the victim is a citizen going about their own business, or a police officer. The act of measuring rehabilitation too is an ambiguous and intangible science.  Someone may behave well while incarcerated - in an effort to obtain parole - and then go back to the their original circumstances upon release.  What then? What is the value of a single human life?  Does everyone deserve to feel security, safety and the right to pursue their own happiness, even inmates who have committed heinous crimes? Most of those incarcerated are someone's son or daughter, somebody's mother or father.  Are those associated with the criminal victims as well.  Certainly so.  The value of one human life cannot be interpreted without considering these circumstances.

38,Refugees from the Ukraine War at the U.S.- Mexico Border,politics," Ukrainians on the US-Mexico border Joining the other many thousands of Hispanics seeking asylum inside the USA are the Ukrainians. In most cases, the Ukrainians have fled the war-torn country that Russia is raping and destroying. As we know, millions of Ukrainians have fled and have been settling in Poland, Hungary, which are nearing capacity levels to receive many more. Other Ukrainians have moved to Italy, France, England. While Europe is taking them all with welcome arms, the USA, a much farther destination for those without much money remains a challenge. Yet, the Ukrainian surge at the US-Mexican border at Tijuana (south of San Diego, California) has arrived. These Ukrainians, like the others, fled when the war erupted. Many have American relatives while others do not. Hundreds of American volunteers await them after their immigration is completed to find them transportation, shelter, food, medical needs. The latest figures show that 600 Ukrainians are camping along with the Hispanics near the border awaiting their turn by a number given to them at the US Immigration. Then, they wait their turn to provide passports of Ukrainian citizenship for processing. Another 500 Ukrainians are awaiting in nearby hotels. The good thing is that Ukrainian refugees have high priority in processing parole once citizenship is verified. Abot 100 Ukrainians are processed daily at this one immigration site (there are several along the border in Arizona, Texas). This can cause some resentment among those Hispanics who have been waiting much longer time because suddenly the Ukrainians move to the head of line in priority. But so far, the Mexicans and other Hispanics have not shown much of this as they understand. The processing time for a family of Ukrainians takes 2-3 days before they are allowed to cross into the USA and the already there are 1000 waiting and more arrive weekly. Most of the refugees refer to social media platforms and messaging apps, groups with thousands of members now explain the process in the Ukrainian language: Many Ukrainians at the US border have indicated that when they went to US Embassy in Poland or Hungary for how to go to the US, they were told that nothing was available yet. There was no new procedure to expedite them. This is where the Biden administration has failed. After President Biden announced that the USA would welcome 100,000 Ukrainians, nothing has been done in the processing of them. Biden should have instructed all US embassies to fast track any Ukrainian refugees seeking to go to the USA via the parole system. This system is available and can be fast allowing refugees temporary entry into the USA for a month or so. Instead, refugees just fly to the border between the US and Mexico, get a number, and wait to be processed. What is more frustrating than fleeing a war zone and going to the US embassy and be told ""nothing can be done yet""! Ukrainians that do have family members already in the USA have an easier time in getting in because they have a place to go to and care waiting. Those who have no family in the USA will have a harder time getting in because aid organizations need to provide housing, food, medical needs. Of course, mixed in with the Ukrainians are some Russians that also fled that lived in Ukraine. It is unclear whether they will get in and if your Ukrainian with a criminal record, you probably will not get in, depending how serious it is. The good news is the immigration procedures at the border station is giving Ukrainians high priority in processing once their number is called. It still may take a 2-3 days to enter the USA."
39,"Development, Creating a Sense of Dread",politics," An amateur writer who enjoys writing, researching and exploring any topic that interests him. Most of the time, when we hear the word development, we assume it means something big, positive, or promising. But the reality is that may not be the case everywhere. Schools teach kids about the importance of development and its impact on the economy of a country. The more development, the easier and more convenient life is what we tend to think. Any development, however, can never satisfy the human mind. Well, let’s ponder upon the facts and see what is happening in the vicinity of development. The bitter truth is perhaps, development has led people to depression, fear, emotion, criticism, outcry, war, and so on. Every nation, developing or developed, faces certain issues that bring dread to people. Be it the superpower nations, the United States and its Western components, or the developing nations, India, China, Brazil, to name a few, development alone is not suffice. Let's examine how development is actually becoming a serious hindrance to the future. The concept of a developed country means it has the highest quality of living, which means it meets the needs of an individual or group in terms of health, living comfort, and happiness. It has developed economy and advance technologies, infrastructure compared to other developing nations. However, extreme development in these countries has also led to many environmental issues. We hear them a lot in the news about issues such as acid rain due to industrialization and extreme smog that causes serious health problems. People are concerned and worried about these several health issues. Now the question that arises here is that, are the people of developed countries really living a quality life? How happy are they? Is there any lack in terms of anything? Well my personal opinion to the answer will be NO/NOT SURE/YES respectively. No matter how far the nation gets developed, certain issues will start to evolve in contrary to development. Take the example of Covid-19, an earthquake from a developing nation that shook the entire world. The recent pandemic can simply teach us how even the developed nations initially struggled to fight against the historic Corona Virus disease. Either the health system of the developed nation failed at first or the virus itself was a development. Homelessness is another major issue in many developed nations, Countries like Germany, France, Australia, and Canada also reports of having 100,000 homeless people in their most recent surveys. As of 2020, the United States reports 580,466 homeless people. Homelessness is largely a result of unemployment, mental illness, and poverty. Technology and development at their peak cannot completely eliminate nations' hurdles. Nevertheless, current trendy tech such as artificial intelligence can be of serious threat to our future considerably, resulting in high unemployment and a lack of creativity in coming days. Another instance can be the on-going conflict between Russia and Ukraine. However, Russia is not classified as a developed nation completely but it can be considered in this context as it once reigned alongside the United States as world superpower. A major refugee crisis has erupted in Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. According to source, more than 4 million Ukrainians have fled the country and millions are internally displaced. Besides humanitarian crisis, the global economy is suffering the effects of slower growth and faster inflation. The move by a developed nation like Russia to invade Ukraine has created concern not only in Europe but around the globe. It’s obvious for developed nations to become obsessed with gaining possessions and power. The advance of technology, building strong militaries, and having nuclear power eventually leads to war and violence. Russia's war with Ukraine proves how a powerful country can seek its own interests at the expense of humanity. In truth, these nations just developed through power and not in terms of quality, comfort, or happiness. Data showing homelessness in United States. Force Displacement in Ukraine. The issues in contrary to development of the emergent or developing nations might be slightly different to that of a developed nation. The emergent nations are those countries with less GDP per capita; less develop industrialization, and low Human Development Index (HDI) compared to developed nations. Meanwhile, China has the second largest economy in the world, followed by India in sixth place. But, despite being the top economic nation, they are not considered developed nations due to their high population and other factors, such as the relatively low Human Development Index (HDI). On the other hand, the UN has categorized 10 newly industrialized countries as being more developed than their developing counterparts in a macroeconomic sense. The 10 NICS - Newly Industrialize Countries These countries are grouped basically according to the fact that their national economies have transitioned from a primary reliance on agriculture to a primary reliance on goods-producing industries, and it also suggests that they are trading more with foreign countries and have a better standard of living than developing countries, but not at the standard of developed nations and regions such as the United States, Japan, and Western Europe. Many developing nations are victims of persistent social and economic inequalities, conflict and forced displacement, climate change, and environmental fragility. Rapid globalizations in these countries are causing in habitat destruction, deforestation, climate change, or natural resource overuse resulting decrease in biodiversity. Brazil a home to world’s largest rainforest Amazon which provides 20% of our oxygen is in threat under development. Recently, in 2019 unprecedented number of wildfires destroyed thousands of square miles of Amazon Rainforest, roughly the size of New Jersey in US. These forest fires are caused intentionally by farmers in demand for agricultural land, mostly for cattle ranching and soy farming. Similarly, in India due to rise in urbanization and speedy industrialization, many forest areas have been found to be depleting at pace much higher in rate. These deforestations occur mostly in clearing highways, railways, mining and, other developmental projects. On the other hand, some of the poorest nations are facing economic crisis against huge foreign debts. According to the World Bank’s data, more than 70 low-income nations are facing extra debt repayments of almost $11 billion (€9.7 billion) this year, an increase of 45% from 2020 after a sharp rise in borrowing last year. Most low- and middle- income countries are facing crisis due to huge foreign debts incurred mainly for developmental purpose and economic stability. Look at Sri Lanka’s present scenario, the island nation is in unprecedented economic crisis because of foreign debt obligation of $7 billion which is to be repaid by July 2022. As a result of this crisis, the government restricted foreign imports into the country, which again resulted in shortages of essential goods and higher inflation rates. India: People hugging trees in protest against deforestation. Sri Lanka: People in long queue, amid fuel shortage. Development, by any means, has created issues that have raised concerns both in developed and developing countries. The way development responds to mankind will probably petrify in the years to come.

40,"World News Diary, March 2022.",politics," What can we say, the war is a terrible thing, it destroys lives and everything else that makes life worth living. People that start the war do not know what they are doing. They may believe they are fixing something, but they are ruining a lot m ore. What happened in March 2022. Welcome to my article (122) World news diary, March 2022. Dear readers, today there are several things happening all at the same time, I would like to write a report, but they are mostly bad news, so, it is hard to decide where to start from, perhaps it is better to start with what interest the entire world, so, let us talk about the war in Ukraine. As we have reported in our last article, the war between Russia and Ukraine has started and there are many casualties on both sides, for me this is a useless war that should not have happened, but Vladimir Putin started it thinking that it was easy for them to win, and it would have been over in a very short time, but it did not work that way at all, because the Ukrainians do not like to be under Russia domination, so, they are fighting back. Hereunder are some of the reports. Russian missiles hits Ukraine’s biggest nuclear plant starting major fires. Quote. Zelensky warns nuclear plant attack could cause catastrophe for all of Europe: ‘You know the word Chernobyl’ Ukraine’s leader has said a fire at a Ukraine nuclear plant could be a catastrophe for all of Europe, ominously warning: “You know the word ‘Chernobyl’.” In an incident that reminded the world how Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine could trigger multiple crises far beyond the borders of Ukraine, officials said that a training building at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe was on fire following a Russian attack. In a message released in the early hours of Friday morning in Ukraine, president Volodymyr Zelensky said the incident had the capacity to threaten the continent. “You know the word Chernobyl,” he said grimly. Shortly afterwards, it was reported that US president Joe Biden had spoken to his Ukrainian counterpart about the incident. End of quote. Anyhow, this war in Ukraine has gone on for a month now, and there is no end in sight. I believe that President Putin wanted the war to end in his favour in a couple of days, but the Ukrainian people do not like Putin rules, so, they are fighting back with whatever they can. So, there are thousands of casualties on both sides. Now the Ukrainian do not want Putin to rule them, they have made it clear from their resistance, so, it is time for Putin to stop this useless war, because it will cost Russia many lives and money, now and in the future. Anyhow, this is only a simple man view. Just as I was saying, this war is not going Putin way, you see, just a few minutes ago, I have found on Face Book that the Russian Army that was supposed to occupy Kiev has been stopped and defeated, and now they have only three days of food and ammunition. So, we are waiting what is going to happen next. Anyhow, we hope that Putin starts thinking how to end this war soon, because it is very unlikely that the Ukrainians will surrender. --------------------------------- This photo shows just a tiny bit of the flood damage that the incessant rain has done this year. We hope that this does not happen many times. Thousand of people have been evacuated during the flood, and some have lost their lives. Talking about the weather Now let us talk about the weather because this is another problem that affects most people. You see, this the weather seems to be changing for the worse. Here in Brisbane Australia this month of March has rained a lot, it has rained for four days and three nights no stop, I have never seen this before. Now what I am saying next may seem strange, because we all believe that rain is beneficial to all plants, but it is not so. When it rains too much nonstop, a lot of plants will die, this has happened to me several times. This month of March 2022 has been even worse because most of the plants in my kitchen garden have died, and those that are still alive, are not growing much. So, if this sort of weather continues in the future, it will be a real problem. But let us see, what the internet says. (And I quote). At any one time, Earth’s atmosphere holds only about a week’s worth of rain. But rainfall and floods have devastated Australia’s eastern regions for weeks and more heavy rain is forecast. So where’s all this water coming from? We recently investigated the physical processes driving rainfall in eastern Australia. By following moisture from the oceans to the land, we worked out exactly how three oceans feed water to the atmosphere, conspiring to deliver deluges of rain similar to what we’re seeing now. Big actors delivering rain The past few months in eastern Australia have been very wet, including the rainiest November on record. Then in February, heavy rain fell on already saturated catchments. In fact, parts of Australia received more than triple the rain expected at this time of year. So what’s going on? In the theatre that is Australia’s rainfall, there are some big actors – the so-called climate oscillations. They’re officially known as: Like swings in a character’s mood, each climate mode has positive, negative and neutral phases. Each affect Australia’s weather in different ways. ENSO’s negative phase, La Niña, brings wetter conditions to eastern Australia. The IOD’s negative phase, and SAM’s positive phase, can also bring more rain. (End of quotes). Anyhow, it is raining again, and a lot of places that have been flooded early in March were being cleaned, when the weather forecast said that there is most likely another flood on the way, this is very upsetting because people don’t know what to do. I believe that this month of March 2022 can go down as one of the wettest months on record. What I can say here is that, let us hope that this weather pattern does not last long, otherwise there will be permanent changes, which I believe will make our lives harder, because we must learn then, how to adjust to the new climatic changes. This is what I have noted this month. Now let us talk about the COVID19. --------------------- Now it is over two years that the covid19 has been making millions of people sick and there is no end in sight. Anyhow, it mutates and changes name, but it continues to worry us. We hope that one day it becomes less virulent and becomes like a cold. This is the end of March 2022, the covid19 continues, a lot of people catch it faster than before, but the authorities are not issuing many restrictions, as they did at the beginning of the pandemic, so, we hope that the covid19 is less dangerous now, because everybody can catch it easily. To understand what is happening will take time, meanwhile we can look at the tables of the sick and dead people, as we did before to make up our own mind, if things are better or worse. So, let us look at what we can find on the internet. This time let us start with the entire world. In the world at the end of March 2022, people that have tested positive are about 484 million, and about 6.2 million have died. In USA 81.659 tested positive, and over one million have died. In India over 43 million have tested positive, and 521 have died. In Brazil 30 million tested positive and 521 thousand have died. Anyhow, I believe that the entire world wishes that this disease disappears, so, we are all praying and hoping we can go back to a normal life during this year. Now let us talk about Australia. In Australia at the end of March 2022 we have, 4.39 million positive and 5900 deaths. In Queensland at the end of March 2022 we have 747434 positive, and 727 deaths. The authorities are talking to us, saying that people that are vaccinated are less likely to die, so, they are saying get vaccinated, but not everybody does. Anyhow, we are still waiting for the end of the covid19. This is how the politicians handle this disease and hope for the best. Anyhow, we will soon see what the people think at next federal election. Of coarse there is also the budget to think about and other policies. ------------------------- Parliament house in Canberra is where most policies are made, through these policies they can control the people. One of the most important event is when they budget the money they will spend during the year. Yesterday was budget night it seemed OK. Yesterday was Australia budget day, and from what I have heard it is a good budged to keep the Australian economy going. Now, my view is that it is a good budget since most people may get some benefit from it, but this is only my view, now we must wait to see what the experts say, and what the opposition says. Anyhow, there is a federal election coming up soon, and this budget was made accordingly, so, the government splashed up a bit of cash here and there, whatever they could afford, because there is no money around, since the pandemic made the government spend a lot of money already. I believe that most governments in the world are in the same position. So, this debit is not viewed in a negative way since everybody is in the same boat. Anyhow, in our next diary next month, we will talk about what the politicians will say to win the election. Having said that, I conclude this diary for the month of March 2022."
41,Cool Japan Strategy,politics," Jasmine, A girl finds her passion in investigating facts and uncovering the curtains Cover of Tv series “Cool japan” - 2005 Cool Japan, proposed by Tomoyuki Sugiyama, president of Japan's ""Digital Hollywood University"", is a new vocabulary to describe Japanese modern culture. It is to take the export of ""cool Japan"" culture as a national policy, and cultivate more ""Japanese game fans"" and ""Japanese anime fans"" in the world. Japan hopes to promote Japan's economic development by developing ""new cultural industries"" and changing ""product export"" to ""cultural export"". The Cool Japan strategy aims to promote the unique domestic culture that covers everything from games, manga, anime and other forms of content, fashion, commercial products, Japanese cuisine and traditional culture to robotics, eco-friendly technology and other high-tech industrial products,"" e.g. One Piece, Hokage Ninja, Hello Kitty, Pokemon, Kawaii Fashion, Japanese Cuisine, Traditional Japanese Crafts and Potted Plants. Tomoyuki Sugiyama, president of Digital Hollywood University, believes that in the future development of ""new cultural industries"" in Japan, the first priority is to protect intellectual property rights worldwide; the second is to improve the treatment of Japanese animation creators; in addition, all industries should be treated as The stage for the content industry, and more importantly, is to take the export of ""cool Japan"" culture as a national policy, and cultivate more ""Japanese game fans"" and ""Japanese anime fans"" in the world. The youth subculture, which originated in the early postwar period, is almost as long as the history of Japan's peace construction, and its achievements are also comparable. It can be said that it starts with ""bad"" and ""deconstruction"" and ends with ""interesting"" and ""construction"". Today, those ""sub"" cultural ""species"" (such as animation, video games, etc.) that were once regarded as ""non-mainstream"" have not only become ""elegant"" cultures of course, but also the charm of the so-called ""Cool Power"" , and even constitutes an important soft power for Japan to survive and grow in the 21st century. ""The United States occupies half of the world's cultural market, we should occupy the other half."" At the beginning of the 21st century, when Japanese cultural merchants released this rhetoric, the new word ""cool Japan"" to describe Japanese modern culture was constantly appearing in the all around the world. In the face of this shock wave, the American media exclaimed that their cultural industry suffered the second ""attack on Pearl Harbor"". The difference is that this time Japan did not use guns, but animation and games. Japan's ""Pokemon"" "","" Yu-Gi-Oh "", and ""Pikachu"" replaced ""Mickey Mouse"" and became the cartoon image that accompanies the growth of a new generation of children. The rapidly developing cultural industries such as animation and games are called ""content industries"" in Japan. With the development of digital technology, the ""content industry"" has penetrated into various fields in Japan. Experts here say that it combines news, publishing, music, advertising and even mobile phones, automobiles and other industries like a skewer, and derives from it. It is a ""new cultural industry"" that is completely different from the cultural industry in the traditional concept, and it is a real productive force. Japan hopes to promote Japan's economic development by developing ""new cultural industries"" and changing ""product export"" to ""cultural export"". Japanese animation was first exported abroad in the 1960s. At that time, European and American countries bought cheap Japanese cartoons just to fill the shortage of children's programs. However, the unique charm of Japanese anime gradually conquered audiences in many countries. Statistics from Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry show that nearly 60% of cartoons screened around the world are made in Japan, while South Korea believes that it accounts for 65%. In 2003, the total revenue of Japanese cartoons and related products sold to the United States was 4.359 billion US dollars, which was four times that of Japan's steel exports to the United States. Today, the animation industry in a broad sense has accounted for more than a dozen percent of Japan's GDP, making it the third largest industry in Japan. The booming animation industry not only brings considerable economic benefits, but also has a huge impact on the overall development of the ""content industry"". Take 2003 as an example. This year, the market size of Japan's content industry has reached 14.7 trillion yen (1 US dollar is about 110 yen). Among them, in addition to the animation industry, including publishing, radio and television, music, cartoon image and other related industry markets The combined size exceeds 10 trillion yen. In 2003, the Japanese government established the ""Knowledge Wealth Strategy Headquarters"", which officially identified ""new cultural industry"" as an important part of the national development strategy, relaxed restrictions on this industry, increased the budget, and improved relevant laws. At the same time, the Japanese people have also begun to actively set up animation schools, and vigorously cultivate talents and expand the creative team of animation and games through various methods such as holding animation and game competitions. Today, in Tokyo alone, there are thousands of anime and game software companies. The employees of these companies generally work 12 hours a day, and the new products they make are continuously exported abroad. A well-known person in the Japanese animation industry once pointed out that there are various standards and restrictions in the real world, but the cultural world can break through the restrictions of time and space to create characters and plots that cannot exist in reality. There are also scholars who use the word ""cool"" to comment on anime images created in Japan. In contrast, the protagonists in American cartoons often have a clear distinction between good and evil, while the characters in Japanese animations are quite complex. The protagonists are naughty, lustful, lonely and even a little cruel, with unique and vivid personalities; in addition, American cartoon images Prototypes can generally be found in reality, but Japanese cartoon characters such as ""Pikachu"", ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and even the mascot of the Aichi World Expo are very abstract, giving people a novel fantasy. Japan's ""content industry"" now accounts for 10.3% of the world market, but it still has concerns. The industry's annual growth rate in Japan is only 2.3%, well below the world average growth rate of 5%. At present, China is catching up with a speed of 13.1%, and Japan has already felt the pressure of competition. To this end, Japanese cultural circles have called on the government to consolidate the battlefield and create and develop a strong ""new cultural industry"". Take the export of ""Cool Japan"" culture as a national policy, and cultivate more ""Japanese anime fans"" in the world. Photo: TORU HANAI/ Reuters WSJ In February 2013, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe officially launched the ""Cool Japan Strategy"" aimed at promoting Japanese food, animation and local products overseas. Abe has positioned the strategy as a driving force for economic growth, creating a new cabinet and increasing the budget. Abe said he hoped to improve its external image by showing Japan's soft power to the world and help ""regain the pride and self-confidence of the Japanese"". As part of the economic growth strategy, Abe asked the relevant cabinet ministers to advance the Cool Japan Strategy at the Japan Economic Regeneration Headquarters meeting on January 25, 2013. The 2012 supplementary budget and the 2013 budget included 33.6 billion yen and 25.4 billion yen respectively, which greatly exceeded the 16.3 billion yen when the Democratic Party prepared the 2012 budget. In addition to holding international events, the Japanese government will also consider allowing cabinet ministers to promote their hometown products when they visit. A government official pointed out: “If one’s own culture is recognized by the world, it will give the people confidence. It is necessary to make it go hand in hand with economic revitalization."
42,Are Biden's Sanctions on Russia Having the Opposite Effect?,politics," It has been over a month since Putin invaded Ukraine in an attempt to grab Kyiv and Kharkiv, and both have failed miserably. His invasion, on the other hand, from Crimea to create a land bridge has been a success at a cost. What is now left is the Donbas region that has been an issue since the bloody 2014 war between pro-Russian forces. Once the regrouping and redeployments occur, Putin will probably seek to enlarge the already held area and getting a deeper chunk of Ukraine before peace comes. His forces are in positions to seriously threaten the Ukrainian forces holding this area by a pincer movement from the south of Donetsk and from the north, south of Kharkiv. To avoid encirclement and loss, hopefully, the Ukraine forces will pull back as the noose is tightened. Of course, they may hold until the very end and leave like they did in Debaltseve 2015, when Ukrainian forces had been surrounded except for a single road. According to some reliable reports coming from inside Russia, it seems that Biden's sanctions are too slow in working and too limited in their scope. But that their impact has not sowed division within the Putin groups but unity because their propaganda that the West is trying to destroy Russia is true. Just look at the sanctions that increase all the time. But worse, Russia will now demand that any oil purchased by Europe (and that remains a lot) must be done in rubles, not dollars. This would help Russian economy. Europe is still importing oil from Russia despite the sanctions that have decreased it. As for the Russian people, most have bought the Kremlin line and excuses for the war, at least publicly. Their media is very controlled and so it is not too surprising that most of them think the West is trying to destroy Russia. One just needs to see how many Western companies have pulled out, stopped doing business there. One can look at this in two different ways for different reasons. If you're a Russian digesting just what the media tells you, one would think that the West is against Russia. Perhaps the only person that could talk sense to Putin is his daughter who lives in France. Talk about hypocrisy! She has been quoted that even herself cannot change her father's mind. Those in his inner circle have said that it would be suicide to talk to Putin in changing his mind and he listens to no one, anyway. As far as the sanctions, it is obvious that those do not impact the battlefield much when the sanctions are not covering all the bases in their economy. Many banks are not sanctioned. There are loopholes that allow Russia to earn revenue by selling oil to their friends not on the sanction list. Biden's sanctions are half-ass. He knows it and yet does nothing to correct it. Why? Oh, he is afraid of pushing Putin too far! Putin has already said the sanctions are equal to a declaration of war. If true, that the sanctions have had the opposite effect intended, that Russia is more unified against the West than before the war, once all of this over, it will be another cold war scenario of the West against Russia for many years later."
43,Imran Khan Clings to Power after Losing Majority Keeping Pakistan's Tradition of a Leader Never Completing Term Alive.,politics," MG is a keen political observer and commentator who has a ringside seat to the turbulent years of the present political scenario Pakistan has had a long tortuous history ever since its inception in 1947. Starting with the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan in 1951, to the removal of Nawaz Sharif in 2018, no Pakistan Prime Minister has ever completed his term. It is disconcerting to note that all the Prime Ministers of Pakistan have either been shot dead, murdered, hanged by a farcical judicial trial, or simply removed before completion of their term. Pakistan has a dubious distinction as the only country where no Prime Minister has ever completed his term. I wonder if Pakistan would like to consider this as a record to be proud of. A look at the list of removed prime ministers reveals a macabre fact; A tale of death and destruction more like a dark tragedy from Shakespeare like Macbeth, Hamlet, Cymbaline, Julius Ceasor; a list that cannot be hidden. Topping the list is the gruesome hanging off Zulfikar Ali Bhutto after a kangaroo trial in the middle of the night in Rawalpindi Jail and blowing to smithereens of his daughter Benazir Bhutto with the connivance of the Pakistan president after a public meeting. The same game has started again and the present incumbent Imran Khan, a political lightweight who had been positioned by the army to be the Prime Minister of Pakistan is now on the verge of being removed. The army has given the green signal for the removal of Khan who is fighting tooth and nail and cooking up all stories to try and remain in power. The previous Prime Minister Navaz Sharif was removed after the army became uncomfortable with his style. The fact that under his regime the previous president of Pakistan General Pervez Musharraf was sentenced to death for treason to the nation and connivance in the murder of Benazir Bhutto was the added impetus. The army in Pakistan is referred to as the establishment has been calling the shots since 1958 when General Ayub Khan carried out a military coup and promulgated martial law. As things stand the establishment has a constitutional rule in the governance of Pakistan, which is unheard of in any democratic country. The army brought up the charges against Nawaz Sharif and got him sentenced to 10 years in prison but on a bargain- plea was allowed to go to England in exile. The army positioned Imran Khan as the Prime Minister of Pakistan and he expressed his gratitude to the army chief General Bajwa by giving him a three-year extension. But Imran Khan was a total failure as the Prime Minister of Pakistan. He had been a famous cricket player who was captain of the Pakistan cricket team but playing a cricket match is a different game from being the Prime Minister of a diverse country like Pakistan; instead of leading Pakistan forward, he was bending backwards to be on the right side of extremist groups. He thought he was very clever when he stoked the embers of obscurantism by publicly stating that the blasphemy laws were essential for Pakistan. Many Pakistanis want the laws scrapped. Imran Khan also built up euphoria in the country in favor of the Taliban and girls were encouraged to sing songs like ""Salam Taliban."" All this evaporated within 30 days when the Pakistan Taliban, a sister concern of the Afghan Taliban launched attacks on the Pakistan army all over; in addition, there was a border clash between the Taliban forces of Afghanistan and the Pakistan army. His worst performance was on the economic front where the Pakistan rupee has been devalued immensely. There is runaway inflation and Pakistan does not have money to even service its debt payments. It has been put on the grey list for terror financing by FATA and the country has lost prestige in the World. Imran Khan is one of the singular leaders of the world to whom Joe Biden has not even spoken once during the last two years. He put all his eggs in the Chinese basket and now has mortgaged its economy to China and China is extracting its pound of flesh. The army saw the drift and realised they had done a mistake in putting Imran Khan in the Prime Minister's chair and with a little encouragement the opposition was able to unite and have pressed for a no-confidence motion against Imran Khan. Imran Khan however has not thrown in the towel and he's fighting tooth and nail and bribing members of his own party who have left him to come back. Imran Khan has also angered the army when in a public speech he referred to the army's neutralism as akin to the action of an animal. Imran Khan is now dodging holding the parliamentary session and one can expect any number of fireworks from him but whatever happens sooner than later he will become a postscript in Pakistan politics which in a way will be good for Pakistan. Though I dare say the leader who's likely to replace him Shahbaz Sharif is no angel himself. If you look at the history of Pakistan for the last 75 years, one does not see any encouraging signs. I do not recollect any Pakistani leader who could comfortably complete his tenure whether he be an army general or a civilian. Apart from the removal of the civilian PMs, the presidents of Pakistan have also nothing to show. Iskander Mirza was exiled to London, Yahiya Khan remained in house arrest, Zia Ul-Haq was assassinated in a bomb blast in his aircraft, and Pervez Mushrff was exiled and now hiding in Dubai. The only comparison I can make as far as the Pakistan leadership is concerned is that it is almost like the land of Hades. It's about time the dream of Muhammad Ali Jinnah was fulfilled. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-10/why-pakistan-s-leader-is-facing-the-risk-of-ouster-quicktake The Unraveling: Pakistan in the Age of Jihad  by John R Schmidt ( The book explains how Pakistan became a haven for militant groups) © 2022 MG Singh emge"
44,The Root Cause of Human Demise,politics," International Man of Dignity, anthropologist, and socio-economic researcher / commentator. What is at the heart of all the planetary bad news and disasters we keep seeing unfold before our helpless and anxiety-ridden eyes? Is it that we are naturally violent and destructive creatures? Is it that we are too dumb to see where all this is heading? I would argue, No. By far the most of us are not inclined towards violence and destruction. Nor are we too dumb to see where this is all heading. So what is it that’s driving us in these unnatural directions? Put simply, the root cause of our planetary destruction is - the corporation. It is the corporation which facilitates the exponential centralisation of wealth into the hands of fewer and fewer men. It is the corporation which places obscene profits in off-shore “banks” and shrouds their nefarious activities in complex administrative secrecy such that even national governments can no longer see them, let alone tax them. It is the corporation which buys up enormous tracts of land in third world countries, driving already impoverished millions off their only form of self-sustainment, for single purpose growing programmes which completely undermine bio-diversity and nature’s own capacity for heading off disasters. It is the corporation which dumps untold millions of tons of effluent into our rivers and oceans and into the air we breathe. And it is now the corporation which buys up huge swathes of our supposedly democratic political systems and totally dominates our supposedly just legal systems. In the corporation we, as a species, have devised the perfect vehicle for psychopathically driven humans to dance unfettered to their inner callings. The qualities and values of the corporation and its psychopathic drivers have nothing whatsoever to do with the qualities and values of our species as a whole. As we, over the aeons, slowly dragged ourselves out of fear and darkness into planetary dominance, the major breakthrough for us came with the development of the amygdala in the brain and the associated capacity for empathy. Language and co-operation and our ability to live and work together in large numbers arose out of this. This empathy is what set us apart from other species and generated the possibility of the kind of collective and co-operative activity at which we have come to excel. However, there exists among us a minority of humans with dysfunctional amygdalae. These people are not hampered by this empathy and are free to focus and pursue goals without the hindrance of consideration for others. People with sufficiently dysfunctional amygdalae are diagnosed as psychopaths. There is no cure for this. It is simply an inherited physiological mutation. Many of us may have psychopathic tendencies to a greater or lesser degree depending on the extent of our own amygdalar malfunction. But those of us with the lowest functioning amygdala tend to focus and gravitate towards positions of wealth and power because lack of empathy is one of the qualities our current western economic model rewards so generously. (See also The New Mutants) Because the disembodied corporation also allows for the perfect detachment of responsibility from profiteering, even good christians can invest in corporations without having to face up to the ravages they force upon eco-systems and impoverished humans. Such christians are thus free to enjoy their escalating dividends without the pangs of conscience and to look upon the psychopathic tendencies of corporate chief officers as excusable in the interests of their own ""returns on investment"".  And such christians to whose attention corporate criminality is brought can wring their hands and say, “Gee, I honestly had no idea….” We, in the comfortable west, see the narrow minded mutant psychopaths who gravitate to the top of these corporations because of their singular ability to focus on “the bottom line” - to the exclusion of all else. Uninhibited by conscience or empathy, these people are free to trample the planet and its inhabitants at will in the sacred pursuit of ever-increasing shareholder dividend. This includes trampling the sad attempts at democratic institutions and the sorry safeguards those democratic institutions struggle hopelessly to devise and implement. And the psychopaths are supported in all this by their silent shareholders whose only interest is watching the value of their short-term investments tick inexorably skywards. It is corporate humanity - both the proactive psychopaths and the passive investor/shareholders - which is generating the obscene wealth with which corporate humanity itself can exploit and abuse and manipulate the rest of us. It is corporate humanity which has the free hand to gamble on how rapidly we destroy our own life support systems. And what do we do about it? We applaud them for it. Carefully cultivated by the mass media they control, we, the dumbed-down masses, see these corporate leaders as swash-buckling heroes and champion ""entrepreneurs”. As our air is putrefied over our heads and our planet is destroyed beneath our feet, we envy and admire them. As they streak back and forth across the globe in their private jets, they are above the law and above the pandemics. They can not only drive down our wages and further endanger our working conditions, they can also incarcerate and even kill us - with complete impunity - if we raise concerns or objections. Even as some of the more courageous among us, once in a blue moon, begin to expose them, the corporates - as has been amply illustrated time and time again - can still finance the manipulation and distortion and befuddlement of opinions and legislatures and law courts. Is the game over? Have the psychos finally won? Are they on the verge of establishing the untouchable global “master class” of humans that the rest of us will serve forever and worship from afar? It would appear so. If the links between the billionaires who own most of the planet, their bankers and acolytes, and the intelligence services (who we pay for but who work to protect the western “economic miracle” the psychos have created) are not soon revealed for all to see, we’ll know our last chance has come and gone. Is there an alternative? Of course there is. Has been for 200 years. (See There IS an Alternative.) Is it too late to implement this (or any other) alternative? Probably. As our over-funded mainstream media and our under-funded education systems continue to fail us, we see Ignorance raise its ugly head to heights unseen since the middle ages when the church was manipulating information. And we see that the New Ignorance, now manipulated by corporations, is sufficient to completely incapacitate our struggling democracies. Our carefully reasoned arguments (which sometimes take more than 30 seconds to absorb) are now lost amidst the ghastly cries of this New Ignorance.  © 2022 Deacon Martin"
45,American Intelligence Thinks Putin Feels Misled by His Troops After Repeated Failures During the Ukrainian Invasion,politics," ‘We believe Putin is being slandered by his advisers about how badly Russian soldiers are doing ... because his top advisers are too scared to tell him the truth’ ""Continuous tensions"" are said to have escalated between Russia's military leadership and President Vladimir Putin, who say American spies feel misled after repeated protests in Ukraine. White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said officials had ""details"" about the split between Putin and his advisers but did not present evidence of the allegations. ""We believe Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly Russian troops are doing, and how the Russian economy is crippling sanctions because his top advisers are afraid to tell him the truth,"" he told the White House. daily information. ""It is therefore becoming increasingly clear that Putin's war has become a strategic mistake, which has left Russia weak over time, and is increasingly isolated from the rest of the world."" His comments reflect reports of previously unknown U.S. officials, who said there was a clear split in the flow of accurate information to the Kremlin. The official told The Hill. “Putin did not even know that his troops were exploiting and losing prisoners in Ukraine,"" While Joe Biden told reporters during a vaccination photo that he ""could not"" comment on a dispute between Putin's positions, both the State Department, the Pentagon and UK government officials repeated the allegations. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during a forum in Algeria that the reports were a sign of Achilles' heel when people could not speak the truth in power. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby added that it was ""sad"" that Putin might ""not fully understand the extent to which his troops are failing"" in Ukraine. ""It's his soldiers,"" Kirby said, according to the Washington Post. “It is his war. He chose you. … In addition, one of the consequences of that would be an unreliable attempt to negotiate some kind of agreement here. If he does not fully understand how he is doing wrong, then how can the negotiators break the permanent agreement? "" The fog of war and rivalry overshadows the way the Russian military operates, badly or otherwise. According to the head of the UK intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), Mr Putin has ""strongly condemned"" the situation. The head of Britain's GCHQ intelligence agency, Sir Jeremy Fleming, will use a rare public speech in Australia on Thursday to highlight the actions of desperate Russian soldiers - from shooting down their planes and destroying their weapons to refusing to carry out orders. An earlier issue of his statement released to the British media, Sky News and The Guardian, stated that Russian cybercriminals ""wanted targets"" beyond Ukraine in countries opposed to Mr. He is expected to add that Wagner troops from the private sector are preparing to send a large number of personnel to fight in Ukraine, which is likely to be Mr. He said in a statement “We have seen Russian soldiers - armed with deficits and misbehaving - refuse to carry out orders, destroy their weapons, and accidentally shoot down their planes,"" ""And while we believe that Putin's advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what happened and the extent of this unfair judgment must be made clear to the government,"" it continues. The fall of the Russian military has shattered trust between Mr. Putin and the Ministry of Defence. Although Mr. Shoigu was considered one of the few counsellors Mr. Putin confided in them, persecution of the Ukrainian war damaged relations. Mr. Putin has imprisoned two top intelligence officials for providing unscrupulous intelligence before the attack, which could have contributed to a state of panic. With evidence of growing frustration Mr. Putin, the United States in recent weeks filed a spy case that did not receive an accurate examination from the Minister of Defence and other senior officials. U.S. officials believe Mr. Putin continues to be misled and that senior advisers are not willing to speak the truth. What US intelligence sources may have in the Kremlin is a well-kept secret. However, since Russia began its military formation at the Ukrainian border last year, U.S. intelligence officials have accurately predicted Mr. Russian troops announced a change in their stance on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, on Tuesday; although U.S. officials have expressed doubts, that Russia is stopping its attacks as an act of peace. Instead, some believe the movement is an additional sign that Russia is fixing its failed strategy. It is also possible that the flexible strategy is a sign of inefficiency and poor communication in the upper lists of the Russian Ministry of Defence."
46,1976 Swine Flu Scare,politics," The writer is a history enthusiast who likes to explore the various perspectives of past events that shaped the future landscape. A Screen-Grab of the 1976 Vaccination Advertisement January 1976, Outbreak of mystery illness at Fort Dix base, PA. February 4, A 19-year-old private, possibly patient zero of the swine influenza outbreak, succumbs to his illness. Dozen more report in sick and test positive for antibodies. A group of intramural and extramural influenza experts reach a near consensus that the Fort Dix swine flu could likely become the source of an imminent pandemic, similar to that of 1918, because Fort Dix virus had the antigenic characteristics of what was thought to be the 1918 virus. February 14, CDC issues a notice to all U.S. hospitals to be on the lookout for any cases of swine flu.March 13, Citing the “strong possibility” of a swine flu pandemic, CDC Director David Sencer recommends an unprecedented plan - a mass vaccination of U.S. citizens. What later became the infamous 'Sencer Memo', outlines a proposal of $135 million to prevent the pandemic that could cost billions of dollars and loss of several lives. March 15, U.S. Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, F. David Mathews in a more strongly worded memo warns of a possible return of 1918 flu:“There is evidence there will be a major flu epidemic this coming fall. The indication is that we will see a return of the 1918 flu virus that is the most virulent form of flu,” “In 1918, a half million people died. The projections are that this virus will kill one million Americans in 1976"", Mathews wrote March 24, President Gerald R. Ford, flanked by virologist Dr. Jonas Salk (pioneers of polio vaccine) and U.S. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare F David Mathews, announces a national swine flu immunization program during a White House Press Briefing. April 8, Merck's liability insurance company warns the drug maker its coverage would end if Merck participated in the vaccination program. Other insurers soon follow suit July,  Scientific community began to arrive at a near concensus that For Dix strain, as initially believed was far less virulent.August 2, Two members of the American Legion die of a strange respiratory disease they acquired at the convention of the American Legion at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia. Death toll mounts in coming days and around 29* casualties are reported off the 182 cases. Media springs into action spreading fear and paranoia over the deaths. Initially believed to be swine influenza, the causative agent would only later be identified as an unknown strain of bacteria, and subsequently named Legionella and the disease - Legionnaire. August 3, Panicked over the Legions deaths, Congress agrees to completely indemnify the drug companies against any and all lawsuits they might incur as a result of swine flu vaccination adverse reactions/mishaps.August 5, The CDC director testifies before Congress that the Legions had died of a new disease, a type of pneumonia that was definitely not swine flu. Congress springs into action and cancels the indemnification agreement with the drug companies. The drug companies announce that they would immediately cease development of swine flu vaccines. Amidst the re-indemnification chorus, they now were also eying reasonable profits. August 15, President Ford signs the National Influenza Immunization Program (NIIP). This indemnified the drug companies.September, CDC was still investigating the death of the legions and it could only confirm swine flu wasn't the cause. Congressman John Murphy of Staten Island demands an investigation into the CDC, claiming that CDC was stalling on identifying the Legionnaire's disease to panic people into fearing swine flu.October 1, National Immunization Program kicks off, as American citizens line up to get the protection shot. October 11, Approximately 40 million American innoculated. Same day 3 Senior citizens die of heart attack shortly after recieving the shots at a Pittsburgh clinic. The deaths lead to city official suspending all flu vaccinations until further notice. October 14, In a televised address, President Ford and family get innoculated to boost public confidence. December 14, 54 cases of Guillain Barre reported by CDC in its findings from 10 states. December 16, National Immunization Program offically gets scrapped. Around 45 million Americans already innoculated by then. No one knows how serious this threat could be. Nevertheless, we cannot afford to take a chance with the health of our nation. — Gerald Ford (1976) When lives are at stake, it is better to err on the side of overreaction than underreaction. — J. Donald Millar Turning back the chapters of history I stumbled upon this story ostensibly, a tale of failures or deception perhaps definitely not of glory of men who pretend, donning a persona like politicians and god-men or NGOs masquerading their intent under pretence of greater good In deed, a puzzle it seem but it fits like a jigsaw and you can draw parallel, see where this all goes Not hearsay, it happened in New Jersey January of '76, Dix in a fix as a mystery illness spills possibly from pigs They exhort the cohort it's base in a fort Private life matters but this made public Isolated cases then form basis paranoia sparks, that's basic By February, a fatality adds to the stress and piques interest of the press 'Specter of 1918'—front pages flash propaganda spreads, the pandemic is back!

47,"I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar: Refuse to Be Undefinable & Pushed Aside; Stand Strong for Life, Children and Parental Rights",politics," Ignore the in-my-face obvious issues and lend all of my attention to unwarranted, groundless non-issues?

Not happening! Although, I am a woman, a Supreme Court nominee, cannot acknowledge that fact and recently, refused to define me. For you see, she cannot, not in the mad, mad world of Woke-ism! She, Ketanji Brown Jackson, the nominee {my apologies Ms. Jackson, if the word ""she"" offends you...old dog-new tricks and all that} will skirt around it, for as long as is necessary. Citing nonsense, such as, ""she's not a biologist"", therefore, she is not qualified to comment on the subject of womanhood! Say what? I understand a Judge's predicament and the measured thought process which must be utilized at all times, but it doesn't take a Rocket Scientist to figure out what this ""skirting"" the meaning of words, is all about! This is one big and getting bigger by the day, nasty, smelly and oh so messy...can of worms, which has been opened! Comparable to the pro-abortion crowd's need to make human beings in the form of babies meaningless and something less than they are, in order to convince Mothers that it is perfectly okay to kill their babies. Speaking of worms, can only fishermen broach that subject? Speaking of broach... This is how ridiculous it has become. Someone recently scolded me for mentioning the fact that some Teachers are, in fact and reality, activists! They are having sex++ talks with their students, as early as Kindergarten; age range, five to six years old. You would think that I had thrown all Teachers under the bus or broken some cardinal rule, by pointing out what should be obvious! Kindergarten isn't the time, nor the place. Young children aren't ready for sexual orientation and their teachers aren't qualified to go there! We have all seen the ridiculous move to ""defund the Police"" and how the progressive left has poisoned many minds against all Police Officers, because of one rare, bad apple. Police and Security Officers, those in uniform, are much less safe today, as a result! I have tremendous respect for the many outstanding teachers and I admire the rare and unique gift they've been given, a Teacher's heart! As for warped, radical activists with agendas, those whom have somehow made their way into the classroom, that's a whole different ballgame! I pray Lord, let their days in the classroom, be numbered - If teaching the basic ""three R's"" isn't even on their radar, but boasting on social media about their little sex talks with the littles, is... then they do not need to be anywhere near a classroom or children, for that matter! I will take it even further...they should be on a National watchlist. I will always call it as I see it We have been silent for far too long and I understand it, to a point. You must have thick skin to stay the course! We see individuals, such as my Governor, Ron DeSantis, Florida, actually speaking out and doing something and for that, he gets threatened and raked over the coals. But, he is also a Father, and he is working to keep woke agendas, out of the classrooms of the lower grades These individuals who are, attempting to cloud young minds with things their young minds aren't close to being able to accept yet, know full well, the influence they have over them. They must be made aware that we are, in fact, paying close attention and that it will not be tolerated! * Governor DeSantis has signed a bill that prohibits mature subjects, such as sexual orientation and gender identity, from being discussed in the classrooms of Grades K through 3. It is all over media right now, you can't miss it. Well, I take that back, you may very well have missed it, because it has been labeled and promoted as something else entirely! It is called the ""Parents Rights in Education"", bill, but you have, more than likely, heard it referred to, as the ""Don't say Gay"", bill. If it were up to me, there would be no Sex Ed. in public schools, until right before a student's freshmen year of high school and then, only with, the consent of Parents. In an effort to protect children from language, books, pictures and discussions of subject matter which their maturity level is nowhere near ready for, our Governor has been made out to be the bad guy, called every name in the book and vilified from coast to coast. I am certain that he is used to it by now, but the left; mainstream media, woke Corporations and the far gone Democratic party, have made it their most recent mission, to see to it - that the main thing, isn't the main thing! They are working overtime to make it about everything but... But, that's what they do, that's what they've done for far too long and it is detrimental, not only to this country, but to the most young and vulnerable among us! Children must be left alone to be children, it is such a very small window, such a brief moment in time, it is not a lot to ask, that they be given their time of innocence, but that doesn't mean that we, as their parents/guardians/caretakers, let our guard down for a second “So the line had stuck in my head. “Sex,” I was pretty sure, meant whether you were a boy or girl, and “sin” made Tante Jans very angry, but what the two together meant I could not imagine. And so, seated next to Father in the train compartment, I suddenly asked, “Father, what is sexsin?” He turned to look at me, as he always did when answering a question, but to my surprise he said nothing. At last he stood up, lifted his traveling case from the rack over our heads, and set it on the floor. “Will you carry it off the train, Corrie?” he said. I stood up and tugged at it. It was crammed with the watches and spare parts he had purchased that morning. “It’s too heavy,” I said. “Yes,” he said. “And it would be a pretty poor father who would ask his little girl to carry such a load. It’s the same way, Corrie, with knowledge. Some knowledge is too heavy for children. When you are older and stronger you can bear it. For now you must trust me to carry it for you.""  - Author Corrie Ten Boom Wisdom Understanding what is true, right or lasting. Common sense, sagacity, good judgment. Faith, wisdom, common sense, steady and firm resolution, will see us through this fight and do not doubt for a second, it is a fight. We need to fight harder than the radicals who are working to change the meaning of words, to make women, parents, even God, obsolete; who wish to have all control over our children; believing they know what is best for them. How often have we heard such things said over the past few years, at School Board meetings, leaked Zoom meetings, etc.? Too many. They are the reason Governor Ron DeSantis has signed the bill he has signed - think about it, the fact that there's even a need to put forth such a bill, protecting children and protecting Parental Rights! It needs to be put forth in every single State! The woke, progressive left will not stop, they'll not rest, we can't either!  Hear us roar! © 2022 A B Williams"
48,Thanks to the Anglo Saxon Powers Led by Joe Biden World War 3 and Destruction of Ukraine and Us Hegemony Has Begun.,politics," An senior air warrior and political observer who has the pulse of the region and can sense a change when it comes. The topic is so vast that one will require a book on the subject. I will do that later and I hope to dictate this to my secretary but as a prelude, I will write this article which of course had to be a little longer because the subject is very tricky. It is an explosive subject and in my opinion is going to mark the end of an era; the era of the dominance of the Anglo-Saxon powers notably the United States. The USA would have led the world for another hundred years but shortsighted men with petty minds led by men like Clinton and now Joe Biden, has led or I will say will lead to the destruction of American hegemony and their civilization. There was a brief interlude when Donald Trump became president and one hoped that he would get another turn and but dark forces and the manipulation of the voting had an effect. In short, he was defeated and the man who replaced him was an inconsequential individual who perhaps did not know where his actions would lead America to. It is very painful to write this article because I have a strong association and connection with the United States so many of my relations are there. I am a frequent visitor but never have I seen America so perilously close to destruction as now. To start with we must accept the fact that NATO is an obsolete creation. This was recognized by Donald Trump but Joe Biden and his sidekick Boris Johnson could not see beyond their nose and they persisted in expanding NATO and created the enemy as Russia. It is not worth mentioning now that Russia had applied for membership in NATO when Boris Yeltsin was president but Bill Clinton and his advisers negated the application. The impact was very simple, at a later stage, they would create Russia as the enemy as the raison de etre for NATO to exist.  They hoped to try and finish Russia for the next 100 years, so that the Anglo-Saxon powers would continue the hegemony over Europe for a long long time. Any scenario has many imponderables and Biden and Johnson who are extremely mediocre persons could not see that whatever they had planned was not going to succeed. The World, almost half of humanity led by China and India will not allow the Anglo-Saxon powers to succeed. Little did the small men realize that by putting Ukraine as a frontline state against Russia would be like a red rag to a bull and would lead to war; perhaps they wanted this war thinking that it would bog down Russia and the sanctions will take effect. They expected the world to join them but 3 billion people from all over the world do not wish to toe the American line. Russia has got a lifeline against economic sanctions and now there is a very real danger of a nuclear war. The centerpiece of this Shakespeare's tragedy is Joe Biden. This man could've easily nipped the trouble in the bud but he did the opposite, he held out a lollipop to one of the most naive politicians in the world Zelensky, and egged him on to take on Russia. Russia had said the expansion of NATO to Ukraine was a danger to their existence and they would not allow NATO troops on the border but Biden thought he was king of all that he surveyed. He refused to give any assurance and at the same time secretly began to give the impression to Zelensky that the doors of NATO were open to him. Joe Biden was not bothered that Ukraine would be destroyed because as far as he was concerned Ukraine was an expendable commodity and the important aim was to destroy Russia for the next 100 years. Probably Zelensky and Biden did not really expect that Vladimir Putin would invade Ukraine but he did and now 30 days down the line the battle is on and it's not going to end soon. The result is that Ukraine is totally devastated. The granary of Europe is now a devastated land and there is a food shortage all around. Russians have succeeded in dividing Ukraine and have set up independent republics in the eastern Donbas region. There are many writers in America and some Ukrainian emigres who keep on talking nonsense. They say let there be a no-fly zone over Ukraine and Putin needs to be taught a lesson, even the US president has been talking a lot of nonsense by saying that Putin is a war criminal and he should be removed as president. Joe Biden forgets that he himself is mortal and he may go anytime into the next world and for him to talk like this is extremely jarring to the people all over the world. I am in Singapore and have the pulse of Southeast Asia and I can stay with authority that 85% of people in Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East support Russia. The Anglo-Saxon powers now have been giving millions of dollars of weapons to Ukraine to continue to fight. It does not matter to them that Ukraine is destroyed but again they're playing with fire. if they feel that this is going to be a localized conflict only they are mistaken. There is a very real possibility that the Russians may use a tactical nuclear weapon to counter the massive military aid being given by the western powers to Ukraine. Nobody in his right mind will disagree that any weapon imported into Ukraine means upping the threshold and just as an electron jumps its orbit the same thing could happen in Ukraine. I have already written that the West is not bothered about Ukraine and it's just a pawn in a game of chess but little do small men like Joe Biden realize that the countries of Europe who are now in chorus and singing the choir along with Joe Biden will simply cease to exist from the world map. The small countries like Belgium, Poland, Lithuania, Moldovia, etc are simply cannon fodder. England itself requires just about six thermo- nuclear hydrogen bombs to cease to exist on the world map. This was stated by Nikita Khruschev in 1961 when I think Harold McMillan was Prime Minister of England. You must also remember that in the last two World Wars, the epicenter was Europe and I have no reason to doubt that the Third World war will also be in Europe because of the miscalculations of Joe Biden and his sidekick Boris Johnson. In this entire scenario, the country to suffer the most will be Ukraine, which has become an expendable pawn in the game of chess. It will be destroyed for the next hundred years and with nuclear bombs all over Ukraine, nothing will grow there for the next 50 years, that is the half-life period of the atomic nuclei. I sometimes fail to understand how Biden could have been so insensitive; if he wanted peace in Europe he would have accommodated the Russians but he has considered Russia an enemy and I do not see why. Once the world war commences, Joe Biden himself will be hiding in a nuclear shelter but what about the massive cities of the world like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco? what will happen to them? they may survive but will that survival be of any value. Recently I read that England has 4 nuclear submarines that will retaliate. It's laughable, what that retaliation means when the mother country England ceases to exist.    I sincerely hope that World War III does not take place and Congress will take some steps to curtail the delusional dreams of Joe Biden. If that is done and at some stage, Donald Trump comes back America could still survive. Unfortunately, the elections are still two years away and there is enough time for Joe Biden to ensure that American hegemony over the world is finished forever. We must remember that the Ottoman Empire lasted 600 years, the Mughul empire for 300 years, and the British empire for 200 years. In contrast, the American hegemony would be over within 7 decades. America had a lot of things going for it and it could have been a beacon of peace for the world and taking all the nations together but petty mindedness, small thoughts, and mediocre leaders like Joe Biden who were voted in by the American public are going to ensure that the Swan Song of American hegemony is sung. All those who are chanting songs supporting Biden are not aware that more than 2/3 of humanity is against the Western powers including 3 billion people of India and China. I fail to understand how Biden could not see China as a threat and he repeatedly articulated that China is a competitor and not a rival. That is perhaps for the fat box which his family has been earning from China. The sad part is that the Ukrainian leader Zelensky himself is mentioned in the Panama papers and has billions stacked away in London and the Virgin Islands. This man has led Ukraine to destruction. It is easy to arouse the people with rhetoric and that is what Biden and Zelenskyy are doing. The only sane voice is Macron but he's been overruled. Yes, but astrological combinations show that after the fifth of April an extremely dangerous period is coming and could mean a nuclear explosion. That may well bring about World War III unless Mr. Joe Biden is removed as the president of the USA by an act of God. © 2022 MG Singh emge"
49,The Right Lane for Minorities,politics," I am a Historian, Martial Artist and Criminal Justice/ Military expert having focused my lifetime studying Warrior Ethos and culture. America was founded on the principles of Life, Liberty and pursuit of happiness. The Hispanic community's culture of family, hard work, and pride “orgullo” go hand in hand with not only the American dream but the Republican party values as well. They just don't know it. Frederick Douglas exclaimed “I recognize the Republican party as the sheet anchor of the colored man’s political hopes and the ark of his safety.” Hispanic and black Americans consecutively vote Democrat to their own demise. Why you might ask, it's because the Democrat party has become the master of spin. They tell minorities they are the party of civil liberties, Affirmative action, social programs that help the poor. It is an outright lie. A higher number of republicans voted in 1964 and 1965 for the civil liberties act than democrats. Truth of the matter is that the programs that they claim help minorities do the exact opposite. Public education has failed to be the key to gain not only competent citizens and competent adults but competent voters as well. It is the minority population that is the most directly affected and suffers from the consequences of counterproductive liberal policies of failing schools, violent crime and gun control legislation (New York, Chicago), housing prices and land restrictions driven by environmental cultists. They don’t have the same resources that these disconnected leftists have to put their children in private schools, or to live in gated communities to escape the crime.      We have been at war for over 50 years against the left. Hitler once said “What good fortune for the government that men don't think” the left rely on this same principle. Democrats have cleverly created disasters in America, and then presented themselves as the messiahs offering the perfect solution. Instead they actually push victimology: victim hood. This is evident by asking yourself which party panders to this vision? Which party is in bed with race hustlers like Al Sharpton, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama? Lincoln said “I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts. Democrats and the media have orchestrated a whitewash of history, making Republicans out to be racists and themselves as the party of the poor and minorities. The Democrats have always used Identity Politics to create a divide to push an agenda which surrenders the rights of We The People for their own empowerment. They try to divide us as White/ Black/Hispanic/ Asian- Americans when we are all point blank AMERICAN. They have even weaseled their way into Spanish language with the attempted deletion of gender based adjectives with an X. It is of the utmost importance to progressive propagandists to conceal or at least ignore the essential historical truths: all the heroes of emancipation—Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr.—were Republicans. The truth of the matter is Democrats are the real racists. The KKK forced blacks to vote Democrat or else suffer. Biden lauded Sen. Robert Byrd, a former KKK member who opposed federally-mandated desegregation and civil rights, as someone who “elevated the Senate.” There are school boards right now segregating parents based on skin color.  Progressive ideas are a fools errand… Those who are ignorant of history are leading those who are even more ignorant onto a path of regression. Communism has proven not effective time and time again; yet it continues to be forced down our throats by democrats. It makes no sense to reinvent the wheel. Propaganda is rampant from the left, via main stream media, television as well as social media. Social media leads us to be more anti social, and more self involved. We are concerned more with comparing what we have or don't have. It is not a reality yet a projection of one’s own self perception. All of which depends on your ignorance in certain things. A specific narrative is pushed across the board by these leftists neocommunist progressives that seek to change societal definitions of acceptable values. The Democrats have never been for your freedom but their power. They are the party of the KKK. Now they have been hijacked by communists. The Republicans have been the party of freedom since the beginning. The Republicans have done more for minorities than Democrats yet minorities continually fall for Democrat propaganda. It is Democrat agenda that keep minorities poor and dependent on the government as well as crippling the true potential of this country to stay a world power. Would you keep taking your car to a mechanic that never fixes it? Every time he claims to fix something another thing breaks but to distract you from his failure he grills a steak for you and pays you a little to keep coming back? Chances are you would not! But that is exactly what is going on when you vote Democrat. 1. U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war.  2. U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war.  3. Develop the illusion that total disarmament [by] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.  4. Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war.  5. Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites.  6. Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination.  7. Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N.  8. Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev’s promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N.  9. Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress.  10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N.  11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.)  12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.  13. Do away with all loyalty oaths.  14. Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.  15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.  16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights. Using the phrase 'civil rights' to basically shoehorn any agenda through? Predicted in 1958.  17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers’ associations. Put the party line in textbooks. [I can verify that this happens in higher education, and when you read the rest of the list, you’ll see it’s prevalent in elementary/middle/high school sex-ed and history classes, as well.]  18. Gain control of all student newspapers.  19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.  20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.  21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.  22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to “eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms.”  23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. “Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art.”  24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them “censorship” and a violation of free speech and free press. Protect porn as 'free speech?' Predicted in 1958.  25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.  26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy, and promiscuity as “normal, natural, healthy.”  27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with “social” religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a “religious crutch” [i.e., this basically predicted the rise of “social justice”].  28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of “separation of church and state.” Take away prayer in schools? It happened like four years later.  29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.  30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the “common man.”  31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the “big picture.” Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.  32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture–education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.  33. Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.  34. Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.  35. Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI.  36. Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.  37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.  38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand [or treat].  39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.  40. Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce. [Remember all the huballoo from BLM who had on their website to ‘disrupt the western prescribed nuclear family’? Yup. Marxist agenda. They have since removed it after everyone called them out on it.]'Disrupting the Western prescribed nuclear family' and pushing for no-fault divorce? Predicted in 1958.  41. Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks, and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.  42. Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use [“]united force[“] to solve economic, political, or social problems. [All the protests that you’ve noticed in 2020 and before…]  43. Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government.  44. Internationalize the Panama Canal.  45. Repeal the Connally Reservation so the United States cannot prevent the World Court from seizing jurisdiction [over domestic problems. Give the World Court jurisdiction] over nations and individuals alike.  The Leftist have gained power and office. Their ultimate agenda is to bring on the ""Great Reset"" for the USA. They have been playing the long game and set up their chess board to diminish not just our viability as a nation but to eat away at our God-given rights little by little until we become a Communist nation. Sadly we let them do it. Not only are they against a conservative/patriot preservation of America but they want what they feel is better for America: Socialism, Marxism, Communism anything other than Americanism. They have seized political, social and economic sectors for the onslaught that is to continue to rip this country to shreds. Whether it is petroleum, housing or teachers, Democrats restrict the supply and are then astonished at the consequences. It is not a breakthrough on the frontiers of economics to say that supply and demand influence prices. But it always catches liberal Democrats by surprise - and they always manage to blame someone else for it.  Who is against drilling for oil offshore or in many other locations? Liberal Democrats like Al Gore. Who is shocked and outraged that gasoline prices are rising? Liberal Democrats.  You can create an artificial shortage of anything - whether teachers or landfill - just by restricting the supply. This is not rocket science. It is politics. It's not rocket science to know that the Democrats and their Leftist army do not stand for America. There was a poll released recently that shows the majority of Democrats would flee the country if we were openly evaded. Shame on Patriots for not wanting Censorship in America Hey you social justice warrior shame on us for being American enough to call bs on the silencing and censorship in this country. This is a microcosm of our neighborhood so anything can be relayed here. We don't delete their farcities we simply tell the other side and leave it for people to figure it out on their own. Its the American Way!!! Last time I checked this IS America!! Everybody gets to express their opinions and we can choose whoever we wish to believe or take from two differing sources and infer our own judgement about a topic. But to stick to only one side of the story is nothing more than an un american way of seeing things. I am an expert in many fields via governmental service, and I know 1st hand on how communist/ socialist countries work and principal among their inner workings is the suppression of freedom of exchanging of ideas and the direct spoon feeding of a single story line generated by dictatorial henchmen. Private site be damned this country was built on freedom!!! We have prospered as a nation because of the fact that we are a melting pot: of ideas, races,cultures and beliefs. E pluribus unum, of many ONE... It is not the place of the government or next door to decide what is misinformation. Unless it IS misinformation, like that which the media and government IS trying to push out. I don't believe in coincidence or conspiracy, but I do call it like I see it!!!! shame on us for being American enough to call bs on the silencing and censorship in this country. This is a microcosm of our neighborhood so anything can be relayed here. We dont delete their farcities we simply tell the other side and leave it for people to figure it out on their own. Its the American Way!!!  It's textbook Saul Alinksy tactics. If you haven't read up on him, then u should to know what America is up against.  If there is any doubt as to his malevolent motives, it is removed by the dedication in his book, Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals:  “Lest we forget at least an over-the-shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical: from all our legends, mythology, and history (and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins-or which is which), the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom—Lucifer”.  Religion aside, his focus was the destruction of America from within. Unfortunately he has been rather successful with the implements of his plan and this is a direct result of the groundwork that had been ignored by the majority of Americans while they were brainwashing our children. They silence those who oppose them and create disunity and call it social justice. America is the last bastion of freedom. Whether online or real life. People claim they are woke but still asleep. Time to be awakened! Are you awake yet? Our history is the most important thing. Without it we will tumble into darkness. You can see how the left keep trying to divide us: black, white, republican, democrat, Christian, athiest, left, right and so on but we can't forget we are all American and we have an obligation to our country to care for it, not destroy it. If you think socialism and communism are so great ( history proves otherwise) then by all means leave and go to wherever you think is better. As for America we will always be the Home of the Free because of the Brave!!!! God Bless America!!!  Week June 20th 2021 Recently, the Biden Administration announced their intent to revise the definition of “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS). When President Trump repealed the 2015 Obama-era EPA rule that vastly expanded the WOTUS definition, our farm families, small businesses, local governments, and citizens no longer needed to worry about an EPA bureaucrat dictating what can or cannot be done on their property. Farmers, homebuilders, realtors, small business owners, mayors — Democrat and Republican — along with many others were all alarmed by the Biden Administration’s recent announcement to revise the rule. Restoring the Obama-era rule would result in regulation of nearly every body of water — including streams, water in a ditch after a storm, puddles — and even some dry land. As the EPA works to revise the WOTUS rule, they must not put in place overly burdensome regulations that would negatively impact our communities. Our farm families have faced many challenges over recent years and the federal government should be doing everything possible to mitigate, not worsen, their uncertainties.  President Biden met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland this past week and his weak foreign policy approach when it comes to Russia was put on full display. Over the past six months: A hacking group with suspected ties to the Russian government was responsible for the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, causing the worst gas shortage in decades. This caused long lines at the pump and, in some cases such as in Southeastern North Carolina, a complete lack of gasoline supply.   JBS, the world's largest meatpacker was targeted, likely by Russia, in a ransomware attack that shut down one-fifth of U.S. beef production overnight.   The Biden Administration waived sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline into Germany. Just a few months ago, he canceled the American Keystone Pipeline.   President Biden extended the New START treaty with no pre-conditions despite Putin’s swift modernization of Russia’s nuclear arsenal, which was a violation of the treaty and the reason President Trump pulled us out of the treaty. Generally speaking, we follow the rules of a treaty while everyone else breaks the rules of the treaty. It’s not a winning hand for a safer, more secure America and world. Instead of standing up for America’s national interests and sending a strong message to our enemies that the United States won’t accept Russia's recent attacks, President Biden gave Putin a pass and failed to hold them accountable. He even gave them the list of our most significant infrastructure and asked Putin not to target those in any future attacks. Who in their right mind gives the enemy a list of our most critical infrastructure?? Sure, they have their own intelligence and have compiled their own list of what they have determined to be our most critical infrastructure targets, but why make their job easier? Appeasement never made the world a safer place. Case in point: Hitler and Churchill, Reagan and Communism!! President Biden has once again weaponized the IRS, this time to target Christians. In an official determination letter, the Biden IRS declared: ""The bible teachings are typically affiliated with the Republican party and candidates. This disqualifies you . . . ."" Now the Biden IRS could be going beyond targeting conservatives and pro-lifers – and going directly after Christians. Biden also is making banks report withdrawals of $600.00 or more, to combat tax fraud. But he owes back taxes. The cost for American families to survive is getting steeper by the minute. Food shortages, Inflation, gas prices to $5 a gallon and some places $7, now WWIII at our doorstep. When will the madness end? Every week something else bad happens to us. Build Back Better isn't working and apart from it's all BS here is why almost half of America is falling for the lies:  The education system has done a great disservice to our youth and has failed both present and future adults of this country. Somehow in the course of 250+ years we went from understanding what America should be to not knowing or caring. History and civics have taken a back seat to ideals of communism,socialism,Marxism and fascism. Children are being taught to hate America, freedom and capitalism. Truth became an evil lie. Instead of sending out model citizens of this republic, a bunch of confused, dimwitted, whimsical mob of ""adult"" crybabies were indoctrinated to destroy America from the inside. They can't express themselves in an argument because they are soley focused on emotions. Everything is offensive and they stay offended. Facts are facts. Communist China depends heavily on capitalism, that is why a huge chunk of our manufacturing has shifted there. If it was not for trade agreements China would have fallen long ago. They went from owing us money to owning our economy and imports. Thats why everything you buy says made in china. Covid is no different. It is impossible to have a discussion without involving some level of politics. Ignoring it doesn't make problems go away. But if we are pitted against one another and don't take the time to hear the complete story minus what is being fed by the government and mainstream media then we are being ignorant and playing into the hands of the leftists who are set to destroy this great country. Environmental extremism is another one of those self gloat of righteousness that hinders minorities. Just take a look at California. Pelosi's own district at that. Rampant with homeless and their liberal agenda makes it harder for minorities to stay in the area as a result they leave. Liberal Democrats do a lot of talking about a need for ""affordable housing."" The time is overdue for Republicans to call them on it, expose their hypocrisy, and get out the message that there is no free lunch -- because those who end up having to pay are often those who can least afford the green agenda. Progressives want to replace 98% of current petro-fueled vehicles by adding millions of electric vehicle (EV) plug-in marvels to our overloaded power grid that can be recharged during hot, high power-demand windless and sunless evenings which depend upon rare earth materials obtained from China that controls 80% of the world supply? California plans to ban sales of new gas-powered cars in the state by 2035. Since power demands will be most acute in the evening and nighttime hours when the sun is down, future requirements will be greatly exacerbated during periods when millions of replacement EVs are to be recharged. Does this seem nuts? YES!! The power grid can't handle the little bit of usage it already has to produce; the added extras of EV charging will definitely crash the system and leave millions without power. These dream vehicles are powered chiefly by natural gas, uranium, coal, or dams. Renewables generated just 13 percent of US electricity in 2020, according to the latest Department of Energy data. Fuels the Democrat-Left hates: 87 percent. (Natural gas, 41 percent; Nuclear, 20; Coal, 19; Hydroelectric, 7). Woe to those that oppose this fantasy. It is sad that these leftists live in a fantasyland full of daydreams and the public just fall into their trap. Truth of the matter is that we still need fossil fuels to produce the electricity and then we would need to develop more powerplants to take on the load of powering regular output plus the capability of everyone charging their EV lastly there is the fact that the materials that are needed to build them come from CHINA!!! These technologies are 80% reliable on CHINA!! This would only enrich the Chinese Communist Party. China is using Leftist stupidity for their benefit not ours. China certainly isn't planning on going green. This total reliance on China will cripple the USA not just economically but militarily. Nevermind the question of if EV's are reliable but are they really any cheaper? No, they cannot be cheaper, and that’s even if you run them on renewables. Take solar energy, for example. Even if sunlight is free, the laws of thermodynamics still control. Renewables, whether wind or water power. They simply aren’t efficient. The leftists keep saying trust the science but they are not giving the complete scientific process only their side of the theory. A flawed theory at that.  Last year, China built over three times as much new coal power capacity as all other countries in the world combined — the equivalent of one large coal plant per week. It only serves the CCP to push ""green"" on the world to put cold hard cash in their hands. Materials that were once mined and processed in America are now no longer being touched. Making matters even worse, many of the rare earths mined in the USA are processed in the People’s Republic of China because it’s cheaper to have them do it than to pay for American regulatory environmental and workplace safety costs. GM, Tesla and Ford are all being produced in China. China controls 70% of the EV battery market. All the while China will not be going green itself, and It's record of ""clean"" energy is, not clean. The Biden administration’s attack on hydrocarbons exemplified by capping off the Keystone XL pipeline, cancelling oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters, and suspending drilling leases in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will vastly increase Beijing’s rare earth leverage and control over our national economy and security. Biden changes Federal Mineral Leasing policy EO 14008 directs the Secretary of the Interior to pause on granting new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters to the extent possible under law, launch a rigorous review of all existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel development on federal lands, and identify steps that can be taken to double renewable energy production from offshore wind by 2030. EO 14008 further directs the Secretary of the Interior to consider whether to adjust royalties associated with natural resource production on federal lands. EO 14008 does not restrict energy development activities on Tribal lands. Fossil Fuel Subsidies EO 14008 directs federal agencies to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies as consistent with applicable law by 2022. EO 14008 does not identify or define what constitutes a subsidy under the order. Federal Land Conservation EO 14008 commits to the goal of conserving at least 30 percent of federal lands and waters by 2030. This initiative will involve a review process to identify which lands should be considered eligible for conservation. Energy and Environmental Councils EO 14008 also created a number of energy and environmental policy councils to advise President Biden regarding the future actions needed to pursue his administration’s energy and environmental policy goals. USE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S BUYING POWER AND REAL PROPERTY AND ASSET MANAGEMENT Sec. 204. Policy. It is the policy of my Administration to lead the Nation's effort to combat the climate crisis by example—specifically, by aligning the management of Federal procurement and real property, public lands and waters, and financial programs to support robust climate action. By providing an immediate, clear, and stable source of product demand, increased transparency and data, and robust standards for the market, my Administration will help to catalyze private sector investment into, and accelerate the advancement of America's industrial capacity to supply, domestic clean energy, buildings, vehicles, and other necessary products and materials. What does this mean? The demand for fossil fuels fell during the pandemic only because governments were locking down people and restricting their movements in an attempt to rush into green policies. Over three-quarters of global energy demand is still met by fossil fuels with less than a fifth by non-nuclear renewables, according to energy watchdog the International Energy Agency.China in an attempt to control emmisions restricted usage to only heavy industry. National policies have also played a role in the power supply problems. In China, state mandated power prices mean utilities simply cannot afford to burn coal and sell the power, because the cost of coal is too high to make a profit. Chinese utilities are producing below capacity to avoid losing money, not because they cannot produce more. Meanwhile China is upping their efforts in refining rare Earths, a group of 17 important minerals to electronic and military industries. As Biden failed in Afghanistan withdrawl, China is filling the gap by making buddies with the Taliban. In exchange of this ""friendship"" China has also signed deals for oil, gas and copper mining in Afghanistan. Washington has been meeting with China and Russia to produce statements calling on the Taliban to enter into a peace deal. China is growing an increasing presence in not just the USA but in Latin America as well. Biden is ignoring the Monroe Doctrine and letting China come in and steal our mining and energy resources. Yes China is mining coal on our soil; a Tennessee mine in fact.  Parents have an undeniable role in the raising of their kids, there is little to dispute that fact. With that comes a say in what they are taught not just in home but in school. Yet school boards across the country are denying parents their first amendment right to redress their grievances to a government entity. When parents came to speak out about Critical Race Theory that is being taught in schools and pornography in their libraries they were shut down, arrested, barred from giving complaints and even put on a domestic terrorist list monitored by the FBI. Yes in America this happened. CRT basically says that all whites are born racists and minorities are at a disadvantage so they need to be given a free pass. As a Hispanic I find that offensive and blatantly racist. How dare the left think that because I'm Hispanic that I can't do things others can. That is point blank racist to say a certain tone in melanin prevents that person from being equal to another of a lighter shade. As Dr. Alveda King once told me personally (yes, I have met her) when asked about this ""color plays no part; we are all human beings""!!! Don't take my word for it, here are the videos (due to HP's format copy and paste the links below): https://rumble.com/vos1g0-nc-lt.-gov.-robinson-speaks-out-against-nc-schools-allowing-lgbt-pornograph.html *Graphic Language* https://rumble.com/vx7maw-school-board-flips-out-as-parent-reads-from-gender-queer-school-book.html https://rumble.com/vxjog2-this-parent-reads-excerpts-from-a-book-inside-the-fcs.html https://rumble.com/vv740k-parent-makes-passionate-speech-to-school-board-slamming-crt.html https://rumble.com/vk5gk7-parent-brings-the-cold-hard-evidence-to-school-board-that-doesnt-teach-crt.html https://rumble.com/vicxfr-survivor-of-maos-communist-china-warns-school-board-of-the-danger-of-marxis.html https://rumble.com/vjb1fv-father-of-3-stands-up-to-az-school-board-explaining-how-crt-holds-his-child.html There is a rumor going around that Republican's don't like immigrants. Well that is not true. Republicans want legal immigrants, not illegal immigrants. The sovereignty of a nation depends on defending and controlling it's borders without a border a nation is not a nation. Instead of qualified people like doctors and scientists what flood through the border is an army of uneducated and unskilled people. I don't mean to seem callous but we have plenty of those here already that are citizens. As a Hispanic I can tell you that nothing infuriates me more than to hear the Left push lies. They are quick to say we need to help, but they do nothing to help our own. We have our own veterans and elderly that need help but we do little for them. Those Haitians have no respect for our laws or country. I've dealt with enough of them to know. A welfare state will never be the solution to every problem. There are Americans who need help and can't get it. These people have the ability to travel from Brazil to Mexico but they refuse to go back to their own country and fix things. Its not being selfish or greedy, but enough is enough. Its time we put America and Americans first. We are so eager to give our jobs to illegals and then cry because our economy goes to tank. They are a drain on our society. As a Hispanic I think legal immigration should take precedence over illegal anything. These folks are already showing they don't care about our laws, society or way of life. The majority of their money leaves our economy and goes back to their home country. They trash talk our nation but get all it's benefits. Illegals don't pay taxes yet get all the benefits that we as Americans can work all our lives and pay taxes and social security only to be denied benefits. Not to mention the whole time the left kept pushing an ineffective ""vaccine"" on all of us but refused to force the millions that flow through the border to get one. They were given hotel, school, food, medicine and flights under the cover of darkness and in secret to cities throughout the country. Yet when freedom loving Cubans asked for help and amnesty they were denied entry by Mayorkas. They can't explain that one. This is not what was in mind when referring to the poem on the Statue of Liberty.  Why are the Republicans so amazing? Because they let the Democrats get away with complete misstatements of these and other issues that the general public could understand - if only someone would take the trouble to explain it to them. Republicans have done a lousy job of getting their message out to minorities. The time is long overdue to put their own principles in a contract and begin the process of making a coherent and believable appeal to minority voters. Minorities are so used to being lied to that such frankness would carry more weight than usual.  From top to bottom Democrats are like robots regurgitating the same storyline as if it has been programmed into their heads on a daily basis. Republicans on the other hand fumble with words. That lack of articulation is one of the biggest problems in not getting the message out.  Republicans have more to offer Blacks and Hispanics. Education is the most obvious example. It is not just on the need for school choice, but also the need for school discipline and school safety, and parental rights to know what is being taught and to speak out at school boards when questionable things are going on that the Republicans can offer what the Democrats cannot. From liberal judges to the ACLU keeping disruptive students in a classroom which is not conducive to learning and teachers unions restricting teachers from applying much needed discipline. All for what? A dog and pony show with a pat on the back that will effectively place certain individuals at the bottom of the pile for a gloat of self righteousness. What should we do as a party to garner Hispanic support? We as republicans need to do something to change our messaging to minorities. In Army Leadership training we were given three watchwords Be, Know Do; these three words can also be our guide as we must all Be, Know and Do what it is that makes us Republicans. First and foremost we should not try to be like the democrats and offer free stuff. In the past republicans who have tried to urge the party to seek Minority votes have typically been either moderate or liberal republicans and they've essentially tried to copy the democratic platform. This will not work. Democrats will always be better at this line of thinking. We have a golden opportunity to offer something the democrats can't possibly offer: Freedom & Family values. Reagan speaking on freedoms once said “The Constitution was never meant to prevent people from praying; it’s declared purpose was to protect their freedom to pray.” We can offer the right of parents to choose where their own children go to school and what they're being taught in the classrooms. We need only look at the Virginia governor's race. Support for the Right to Life. We must bring back pride in being American and give Hispanics a voice. We should offer them the assurance of their independence, their freedom to work to earn a great wage as well as self-reliance by bringing jobs back to America. We must be the paradigm shift and do what is right for America first. As a historian I can tell you three things: Socialism will always lead to Communism; it has never worked anywhere it was tried; China depends on America not the other way around; that should tell you something. Whatever the issue, Republicans will have more to offer by being Republican and conservative than an imitation Democrat. We must prepare for the long game and not just be reactive but proactive. Giving a helping hand when needed but not pushing a complete welfare state like the Democrats. There is a difference in helping than slavery-like governmental dependence. Any self respecting American should and ought to take pride in knowing that they can provide for their family and not be solely dependent for a government handout. That is not the American Dream. Ultimately we need to stick to our mission, promise and values by doing what we say we are here to do and not backing down in the heat of battle; there is no ground to give. The only thing we have to lose besides our country is the minority vote. We need to get back in the fight and give them the truth not just by historical facts but in our actions.
