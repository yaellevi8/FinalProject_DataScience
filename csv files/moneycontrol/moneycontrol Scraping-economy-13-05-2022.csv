0,"Interview | With eyes on revenue of Rs 2.73 lakh crore by FY26, L&T will execute strategic plan to focus on core, technology and talent: CEO",economy," Larsen & Toubro’s (L&T) new five-year strategic plan charts out a path for the company to add over Rs 1 lakh crore in revenue by FY26. SN Subrahmanyan, chief executive officer and managing director of L&T, said that the engineering major, which currently derives most of its revenue from the infrastructure sector, aims to be a technology solution provider of eminence in the near future. In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad, Subrahmanyan talks about the road ahead, aspirations to be zero debt and a clean energy solutions provider, and how he is incubating startups within one of India’s oldest infrastructure groups. Edited excerpts: Despite the challenges in order inflow that you witnessed in FY22, especially as domestic order inflows declined, you have given a target of 12-15 percent growth in order inflow and revenue. What’s behind this thinking? It’s positive thinking. We’ve done well, we grew our orders by 10 percent, sales by 15 percent and we’ve grown profit by 10 percent. It’s a very good record to have under an excruciatingly tough situation born out by COVID, the European war situation, the commodity price increase, and logistical mismatch that is happening. L&T and the people who work here have been resilient. This gives us a good feeling that L&T-ites are able to outperform even in an extremely tough situation. Therefore, as the situation eases, we can continue on the path as there is momentum now. One of the biggest challenges has been to get people to infrastructure projects sites. At the project sites, unless you do physical work, there is no billing. We normally employ about 65,000 staff and about 290,000 labourers on our project sites. There was difficulty there as two times the labour went away, and we had to bring them back. We normally employ about 65,000 as our staff and about 290,000 contractual workers to do physical labour at our project sites. Due to COVID, on two occasions the contractual workers left for their native places and we had to arrange for their return. That’s not easy. In the last 24 months, we have not worked for eight to nine months because of COVID. Now the momentum is back, people are back to sites. But there’s a worry about commodity prices, for which we’ve taken adequate measures. But beyond that, we’re pushing on all cylinders and there is a possibility that sales, and profit can continue to grow in this environment. At the press conference on May 12, the management said there is significant deferment in orders, and that government orders are not coming in as fast as it used to. What’s your outlook on the order tendering process? The last two years, we had a blockbuster budget from the government. Now the budget has been translated into action. A huge amount of investment has been planned across core sectors like roads, railways, water projects, power transmission and hydrocarbon. We are present in all these areas so it has had a positive effect on us. And that’s why you see the robust order growth. Now what has happened is that when the crude prices suddenly shot up and as India is heavily dependent on crude, some of the money that we have budgeted gets diverted towards crude. Second, inflation is raising the head, not only in India but across the globe, and we need to be careful and watchful about it. Third, there is a very unnatural increase in prices, which is not only due to raw material price increase but also due to excess profit being made by commodity firms. This does impact the infrastructure space. The government’s budgets are made two-three years earlier, and when we bid for them, due to these factors we bid higher. If the bid is 10-15 percent higher in range, the government departments go through the process and bids are approved and orders are placed. But now due to commodity price increase, bid prices are higher by 20 percent or more. In that case, government departments and public sector companies cannot go through with the bidding and need to debate and justify the price rise. So there could be some deferment or shift in projects. That is bound to be a bit irritating, because what should happen in one month will take two months or three months to happen. Your EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin declined in FY22 and, as you mentioned, commodity prices continue to remain high. Given that and your ability to pass on the cost burden to customers, what will the margins be for FY23? The margin depends on many factors, of which two are most important. As a project company, margin is realised only after the project has done 25 percent of its cost. During the COVID period, jobs which ought to be accounted for profit recognition or valuation in the previous year have not come through and have been deferred to this year. Second, due to the commodity price increase, we deliberately defer some projects. About 85 percent of our contracts are covered with price variation/reimbursement or other such clauses. But about 15 percent of the contracts are not covered by this. Today, the inflation is such that even the WPI increase does not reflect the inflation. Inflation is slightly higher than the WPI graph. So we are experiencing some cost pressures within the system. We will have to manage it. We’ll have to do projects faster, take it up with the clients, and hedge materials. One cannot run away from the fact that there is a cost push, that is what has been reflected in the slight decline in margins in FY22. That will continue during the year, but we will manage it. What is the order pipeline for potential projects that you could bid for looking like? What are the sectors that will drive the growth? Being very cautiously optimistic on this, the order prospects that we are looking at is Rs 8 lakh crore to Rs 9 lakh crore, same as last year. We expect momentum to pick up. Key sectors would be water, power transmission, minerals and metals, and hydrocarbon projects. You have finalised the five-year strategic plan Lakshya 26 which aims at increasing revenue to Rs 2.73 lakh crore by FY26 from Rs 1.36 lakh crore in FY21. This plan was deferred due to the pandemic but now that it’s finalised, what is the goal? We are in three broad sectors right now as an organisation, the largest being the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) projects, the second being the hi-tech manufacturing which includes our heavy engineering and defence, and the third is the services sector, which includes L&T Infotech (LTI), Mindtree, L&T Technology Services (LTTS), and also the outlier L&T Financial Services. So when you look to 2026, these are the three sectors that we will be in; all our investments and plans will be centred on this. What are the growth targets for the EPC and heavy engineering space in Lakshya’26? The EPC project business will continue to grow at 11-13 percent. The last two years were impacted by COVID and looking at them does not give the right picture. If you look at the trend overall, it continues to grow at 11-13 percent. The hi-tech manufacturing business will grow at between 12 percent and 15 percent. Our shops are full right now. We continue to expect that these sectors will get sufficient orders with the growth of refinery, petrochemical, green business and such. How will the services business play out during Lakshya’26? The services business, excluding L&T Financial, have been growing upwards of 20-25 percent. We do believe with the merger of LTI and Mindtree, subject to statutory approvals, the combined entity will see robust growth. LTI is very strong in ERP (enterprise resource planning), and Mindtree is very strong in the customer experience space. A combination of these provides a fantastic service input to clients. What would L&T look like after Lakshya’26 ends? As we look into the future, the EPC project business, which is about 70 percent of the company, may come down to about 65 percent and the 5 percent space could get occupied by the IT and technology services business. This means the market cap of L&T, which is now 30 percent by IT and technology services companies, can become 40-45 percent. So we will be more profitable, average weighted average profitability will go up. We will be more of a technology solutions provider company and that is robust and good from an overall point of view. L&T has been increasingly looking at the green energy business. What kind of plans do you have for this space in the strategic plan? L&T is a truly integrated power company—from mining equipment, transportation of coal, making boiler turbines, putting up EPC power plants, running your own power plant, doing power transmission distribution projects, and we were even present in the medium- and low-voltage switchgears business. We have moved away from some of these businesses one by one; we sold off the switchgear business. We don’t find huge traction coming in our boiler and turbine business for coal-fired plants. But we do not want to lose the fact that we’ve been in this business for decades and that is very fundamental to L&T because power is the backbone of the economy. So the logical move is to look at the green power business. We are the largest EPC player in solar, but we don’t want to be invested in solar projects. So we are looking at getting into manufacturing for electrolysers (for green hydrogen), which can be done in our turbine factory. We are in touch with various technology players across the world, with the right technology and the momentum, to make electrolysers. The investment will be in the region of about Rs 1,000 crore for a 500-megawatt electrolyser production capacity, which is more than adequate at the moment. We also tied up with Indian Oil Corporation and ReNew Power for green hydrogen. We also thought that being in the green energy space, we will have to be in the grid battery storage space. At the moment, it’s not viable because the battery costs upwards of $190 per kilowatt hour. It needs to come down drastically for it to be viable as a power source. We are again in touch with some technology players to see how we can jointly do some research and development to bring battery costs down. And if that happens during the latter part of the planned period, it could see some investments in the battery space, but not right now. How are your monetisation plans for Hyderabad Metro coming along? Two factors that were not going well for the project. One, a lot of people were not travelling to office due to COVID. Traffic had gone down very drastically, now it’s sort of coming back. As we speak, it’s about 300,000 people per day. The second issue was the huge debt of nearly Rs 13,000 crore, so there was interest cost. In our profit and loss account, this project was probably the only loss-making business. We cannot move away from this project because it’s a concession agreement; we are there for 65 years. We also have a minimum equity commitment of 26 percent. We appealed to the Telangana government and they have been kind enough to sanction a soft loan of Rs 3,000 crore into the project. That money will come in over a period of time and once it does, it will go towards repayment of debt which will reduce to Rs 10,000 crore. We have a term sheet with an investor, which I cannot reveal right now because a few conditions and precedents are to be overcome, which will happen shortly. And if that happens, another Rs 4,000 crore of equity money will come into the project. With this, we will come down from 100 percent to 51 percent. If the Rs 4,000 crore investment comes in, the debt of Rs 10,000 crore can be reduced to Rs 6,000 crore. We can also monetise some real estate, which we’ll do shortly. That will reduce debt to nearly Rs 4,000-5,000 crore. We have recently restructured the loan and the interest rate has been brought down from 9.7 percent to 6.2 percent. So with this, whatever can be done financially has been done in the project. We just have to hope that people start going back to office and the project will become cash-flow positive and even viable over a period of time. The best that can be done in Hyderabad Metro is to move it away from the balance sheet by doing an InvIT (infrastructure investment fund) over a period of time, for which we have in-principle permission from the government. It may take two-three years, but we will do that. What about plans to exit L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd (IDPL)? We have a term sheet with a prominent investor. We have our stake down to 51 percent already. During the course of the year, we will move IDPL away from our balance sheet; it will no longer be an L&T company. It is a work in progress and we’ll announce it as it happens. What’s the plan for the sale of your only thermal power generation unit, the Nabha power plant in Punjab? We are talking to an investor and we hope to move the project away from our balance sheet more or less by the end of the year. L&T’s overall debt is Rs 1,24,000 crore, out of that Rs 84,000 crore is from L&T Financial Services, which is not really a debt but their borrowing so that they can lend. So the real debt was Rs 40,000 crore. If Hyderabad Metro’s Rs 13,000 crore debt, Nabha Power’s Rs 6,000 crore debt move away, all we have is debt of Rs 20,000 crore, which is what the working capital requirement of L&T is. We can become a zero debt company by the later part of the year. L&T’s chairman AM Naik refers to some of the new businesses as “Subrahmanyan’s startups”. What’s the plan with that? And could we potentially see more IPOs (initial public offerings) from the L&T group? He is a lovely boss. And he has his ways of going about things. We have, with his views on it, started two or three startups within the company. One is L&T EduTech, which is in the higher education space for engineering studies. We started it as a B2B platform, it seems to have done well. We’ve got more than 80,000 students enrolled right now. We will also end up doing professional teaching as well as move into vocational training. It has been received well. It is something unique that we are trying as most of the education startups are in the K10, K-12 and other such spaces. It is the first time we are offering engineering as an e-commerce solution. Second, we have a startup called SuFin, which is for trade of engineering goods between MSMEs, SMEs and medium industries. It is doing sales of Rs 15 crore per month and seems to be doing well. This is again a unique space. Time will tell whether the new initiatives are good startups or where it goes. I hope I can repeat the winning formula. You announced the much-awaited L&T Infotech-Mindtree merger last week. Since then you have been talking to investors, employees and other stakeholders. From these interactions, do you anticipate any challenges? There are no challenges. When we acquired Mindtree, you were the first person to pull me up to ask when we were going to merge it (with L&T Infotech). We could not do it at that time because ownership issues had to be settled at the company. We did that, we have now grown it. It has come back to 25 percent growth. So it has achieved what it needed to achieve. It also so happened that around the time we took over, Covid happened and Mindtree was big in travel and hospitality, and both sectors went down pretty bad. Now that we have brought it back, it is logical to put the two companies together. To have two IT companies, which have more or less the same offerings but in different sectors, was not the right way to go forward beyond a point of time. The L&T Infotech and Mindtree merged entity will have a very positive effect on clients as they will be able to source solutions from the same organisation. You have a presence across the supply chain in the power sector. Looking at the looming power crisis in the country, and the steps announced by the government so far, do you have any suggestions on what can be done to resolve the issue? I think the government is doing the right thing. Coal-fired has become a bad word across the globe and COP26 and other sustainability criteria are coming in very heavily. I think we are already taking steps which are late, we need to take these steps in a very, very hurried manner across the globe, not specific to India. India does not have any other resources. Coal is our biggest resource and is available in plenty. But we have shifted our views and we have started putting up more solar, hydrogen, nuclear and such other plants. Power is a very sensitive topic in India; it’s sort of a political animal where a lot of subsidy takes place and the discoms and gencos are not in the best of health. But that’s a subject that needs to be discussed in a different forum. Nothing can be done by me making a request right now. But we are very clear that coal-fired units will slow down from an EPC point of view. What about your power equipment joint venture with Mitsubishi? It is a work in progress. It’s not our own decision as we hold 51 percent but we have an excellent relationship with them. We are talking to them, they’re also worried. They also have coal- and gas-powered factories in other parts of the world. So both of us are in a dialogue and if something else comes out of it, we’ll do that. Otherwise, we will have to jointly think of how to take it forward, including making electrolysers and such in those factories. L&T stands at a juncture where the order book is at a record high and you have so many different businesses across so many geographies, each with its own story. How do you divide time between the businesses? What part of your job takes more time? Once you become a CEO, nobody wants you to be in their business. L&T is run by vertical heads. All my colleagues are fantastic and lovely people, they don’t want me to interfere with their business at all. And they’re doing quite well. So I’m happy coming to the office, having a cup of tea, talking to you and going back! (He says this laughing.) Then what is motivating you to come to the office every day, what is the most exciting thing right now?

1,"Interview: Elevated inflation here to stay, repo rate could be 5.5% by December, says HSBC’s Pranjul Bhandari",economy," India’s retail inflation in April was at an eight-year high of 7.79 percent, sending alarm bells ringing across markets and triggering expectations of large rate hikes. Is this the peak of inflation? Where will it go from here? In an interview with Moneycontrol, Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist of HSBC, explains that inflation could continue to stay elevated as price pressures tend to be sticky. More than headline inflation, the momentum should worry policymakers. The Reserve Bank of India may announce one more 40 basis point hike in the repo rate in June. Bhandari sees the central bank taking the rate from 4.4 percent now to 5.5 percent by December in its fight against inflation. Beyond that, rate hikes need to be very careful. Edited excerpts: Q: Has inflation peaked? How would be the trajectory ahead? A: We have a base effect coming in May and June. So, in these two months, CPI inflation will be around 7 percent. But don’t mistake it for actual inflation momentum coming off. My sense is even with these numbers, quarter-on-quarter sequential momentum will remain as elevated as it was in April. In fact, considering the passthrough stickiness, the momentum of the last few months is going to probably stay for the rest of the year. So we should be tracking month-on-month, quarter-on-quarter movements closely. Q: What is your assessment on food inflation? Are edible oil and now wheat the only pain points? Is it more generalised? A: I think the pressure is across the board. Agricultural input costs have gone up as well. In our last reading, agriculture input cost inflation was 15 percent year-on-year – that’s a pretty high number. So, this is the cost to plant new crops and when the harvest season comes, farmers increase the final prices to recoup that upfront expenditure made. And that’s why we may see a lot of the food price pressures in the months to come. But I would not call it structural yet. I will say that India has seen high inflation even before global inflation picked up, but that high inflation was more led by core inflation and not as much by food. Remember when the RBI presented its policy in April, it was still sounding very positive on the food inflation outlook. But the commentary following the surprise hike in May was on the upcoming price pressures on the food side. So that is a key change in the story. Q: A lot of inflation pressure is through commodity prices and their passthrough. Has the complete passthrough happened or will we see more increases? A: Generally, the passthrough from producers to consumers is about 50-60 percent of input cost increases. So far, it is clear that the passthrough for goods manufacturers has been pretty strong. It’s the service providers who are not passing on as quickly and I think there is a reason. Goods demand was a story of last year and a story that has run a good cycle. Goods producers have had the liberty to pass on rather than take it on their margins. Services demand story started this year because only by January a critical mass of Indians got vaccinated and started moving around. So the growth in services demand is still playing out and I think my suspicion is that a lot of service providers are feeling a little uncomfortable about raising prices very quickly. So my sense is that so far goods inflation is far outpacing services. But eventually services inflation will catch up. Q: We have had a very sticky core inflation in the past. Will this continue to cause discomfort? A: I must say that India’s core inflation has been surprisingly high, even before global pressures picked up. Even in 2020, we had core inflation north of 6 percent and it has been a problem since then. There are very India-centric factors at play here. During the lockdown, small firms got disrupted and many had to shut shop or did not have buffers to withstand the long lockdown. These small informal firms were producers of necessary goods like clothes and food items, and there is a certain inelasticity of prices on these. The other story is that big firms got bigger, they gained pricing power, and they began passing on price hikes. I think a combination of these two explains why core inflation was high even when GDP showed a double-digit contraction. Now what we see is that manufacturers are facing commodity price shocks and they have to eventually pass these on to consumers. And that kind of freezes (core) inflation at a level. Q: What will contribute to this stickiness? A: Core inflation exhibits a huge amount of stickiness. I think that inflation is going to be sticky for three reasons. I think number one is the pricing power. Firms increase prices when commodity prices rise, but will they cut when prices fall? We will have to see. The second is the fuel index. Some parts of the fuel index, like kerosene and diesel, are non-regulated and their prices have really gone up. But some other items such as electricity tariffs, have not. Electricity is a big part of the urban basket. Kerosene and biodiesel are a big part of the rural basket. This also explains why rural inflation is higher than urban. Discoms typically do not increase tariffs immediately, it takes 12-18 months to do that. So my sense is that the increase here will start kicking in one year down the line and that might be another source of sticky inflation. A third source of sticky inflation is just the harvest cycles in agriculture. The whole cycle from sowing to harvest takes about six months. So the initial expenditure is recovered through prices only after some months, when the harvest is sold. And the producer would want to keep the price high, given the initial investment. This will make agricultural prices stay high for long. Q: You have explained stickiness elaborately. So can we conclude that the easing of inflation is going to be a slow process? A: If we think of 4 percent, I think it is going to take several years to get there. In my forecast, we can get to 6.8 percent this year. For the next year, headline inflation can go down to 5.5 percent. These are our forecasts and include both base effects as well as a slower economic growth in the second half of this year. But even 5.5 percent for me is a very high number. Q: So what does this mean for monetary policy? Do you anticipate bigger hikes? A: They have done the 40 basis point surprise hike and we expect another 40 bps in the June policy. But after that, we see a 25 bps hike trajectory and not a series of 40 bps. Secondly, we think the RBI will have a couple of pitstops. So the first one would be 5.15 percent repo rate, which I think would be by September. This level was the pre-pandemic repo rate level. The second pitstop would be 5.5 percent and we think we will get there by December. This is an important pitstop because our one-year-ahead inflation forecast is 5.5 percent. At this point, we are out of negative real interest rates. Beyond this, the hikes would be a function of what happens to growth to a large extent. If the RBI believes that the labour markets are at equilibrium and the economy is doing well, then they can take the real rates from neutral level to 1 percent. But we are not forecasting a 6.5 percent repo rate for that 1 percent real rate. What we think is that the RBI will go halfway, to 6 percent repo rate. This is the terminal repo rate I am looking at. I also want to say that the stickiness of inflation does not necessarily mean aggressive RBI rate hikes. The reason is that there’s only so much the RBI can do when the source of the problem is supply side. They can only take care of the second-round effect and that also with a lag and with a side-effect of slowing growth. So at some point, we have to understand that the RBI has a fine balancing act to do. Q: Do you see significant downside risks to growth, especially because of inflation? A: For FY23, we have a GDP growth forecast of 6.8 percent, which is lower than the consensus. Currently, the pent-up services demand is playing out. We have not seen the export story get hurt so far. But these things can change. Our worry is that in the second half of the year, a couple of things will change. One is that services demand would have run its course. Urban purchasing power will also come off a little bit in the second half of the year. The informal sector was doing pretty badly at the start of the pandemic in 2020 during the lockdown, then it recovered. Our sense is that ever since this commodity price shock has hit, the informal sector is again hurting and that could lead to repercussions.

3,Explained | How will the EU ban on Russian oil impact India?,economy," The phased embargo on Russian oil imports announced this month by the European Union (EU) has posed grim prospects not just for Europe, but also for major Asian crude importers, including India. For a country that imports more than 85 percent of its oil needs, the embargo on Russian crude is likely to cause a major economic headwind. It comes at a time when the global economy is battling constant inflationary pressures and supply-chain disruptions after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The oil crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war, among other factors, has also come to bite the Indian economy; retail inflation surged to a near eight-year high of 7.79 percent in April. Also Read: Consumer price inflation surges to near-8-year high at 7.79% in April Soaring inflation was worrying enough to compel the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to reverse the rate cycle in an unscheduled off-cycle meeting on May 4, when it raised its key interest rate by 40 basis points to 4.4 percent. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Some European countries, such as Hungary and Slovakia, which are completely dependent on Russian for their crude oil imports, are not supporting the embargo.  Embargo impact In its sixth set of sanctions against Russia and the toughest one yet, the EU, among other things, is seeking to ban Russian oil imports within six months and refined products by the end of 2022. Notably, India defended its policy to import Russian crude on the same day that the EU announced the gradual oil embargo on Russia. “International prices would further shoot up if a consumer as large as India discontinued its strategy of importing oil from diversified sources,’’ the government said in a statement, without making any reference to the EU's decision, and added that it was important to ""ensure access to affordable energy for our citizens"". The government, however, clarified that energy purchases from Russia ""remain miniscule in comparison to India’s total consumption"". Interestingly, this comes at a time when India has become the largest customer of Russia’s Urals crude oil on the back of steep discounts offered by the Vladimir Putin government, which is struggling under international pressure and increasingly low appetite for its oil in US and Europe.  Oil at a discount? Taking advantage of the geopolitical tensions, the world’s third-biggest oil importer is also trying to get deeper discounts on Russian oil and wants Russian crude at less than $70 a barrel on a delivered basis, according to Bloomberg. The government has condemned the report and alleged that it tries to ""sensationalise routine purchase of crude oil by Indian oil companies from Russia based on concocted source-based stories"". Even so, India is among a handful of nations that have been doubling down on Russian crude, defying international pressure and Western sanctions. But for how long? Aside from the global supply chain makeover concerns, and consistent pressure on input costs, will India be able to cover its energy requirements in the absence of Russian crude? This article, the final of a three-part special series on the impact of the EU sanctions on Russia, will look at what the oil embargo means for India. The first story was a deep dive on the impact of the ban on Europe, and the second one looked at the role of OPEC+. Also Read: India buying Russian oil: I will put my country's national interest, energy security first: FM Sitharaman National interest first At the 17th edition of the CNBC-TV18 India Business Leaders Awards (IBLA), Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India has already started buying oil from Russia since it has come at a discount at a time when the country needs it. ""We have received quite a number of barrels. I would think about 3-4 days of (national) supply. I would put my country's national interest and energy security first,"" Sitharaman said. If fuel is available at a discount, why shouldn't India buy it, the finance minister said. According to a Reuters report dated April 25, India bought more than twice as much crude oil from Russia in the two months since its invasion of Ukraine as it did in the whole of 2021, as refiners grabbed discounted oil that other nations have shunned. Indian refiners placed orders for at least 40 million barrels of Russian oil since the invasion of Ukraine on February 24 for loading in the June quarter of fiscal 2022-23. This compares with total imports of Russian oil into India of 16 million barrels in the whole of 2021, according to Reuters. Last year, two percent of its total oil imports or 12 million barrels of Urals crude, came from Russia. In 2022 so far, refiners have bought cheaper Russian oil to partly offset the impact of high crude prices.

In fiscal 2021-22, India’s crude oil production fell 2.67 percent as state-owned ONGC produced less than the target. Crude oil production at 29.69 million tonnes in 2021-22 was 2.63 percent lower than the 30.5 million tonnes output a year back, and 11.67 percent below the target of 33.61 million tonnes, according to official data released by the oil ministry. In March 2022 alone, the country’s crude oil production stood at 2526.11 thousand metric tonnes (TMT), 12.49 percent l lower than the targeted 2886.55 TMT, according to government data.

This almost doubled its crude oil import bill in FY22, led by high global energy prices. India spent $119.2 billion in 2021-22, up from $62.2 billion in the previous fiscal year, according to data from the oil ministry's Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC). It spent $13.7 billion in March alone, when oil prices surged to 14-year high. India’s merchandise export in April 2022 stood at $38.19 billion, down from $42.22 billion a month back, but imports did not fall by the same magnitude. Petroleum imports drove overall imports higher to $58.26 billion as against $60.74 billion in March, according to the latest commerce ministry data. The import of petroleum and crude products accounted for 33.5 percent of imports in April. In value terms, $19.51 billion of these products were imported last month, registering a growth of 81.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.

Analysts reckon that global commodity price shocks will hurt the economy amid inflationary pressures. “High crude prices are certainly very negative for the Indian economy as they feed into price pressures. As the economy has bounced back from the pandemic-led abyss, and demand is returning to pre-pandemic levels, rise in crude prices could again severely impact consumption and hurt the nascent recovery path,’’ said Sugandha Sachdeva, VP-Commodity & Currency Research, Religare Broking. According to economists, global crude oil prices will witness volatility in the coming months, remaining sensitive to EU sanctions on Russia. Securities firms have also increased their crude oil price forecasts based upon significant external factors and macroeconomic indicators.

A “structural problem” In a research report released last month, ICICI Securities said that the broken demand-supply balance will not correct in a hurry. “What started as a supply shortage due to COVID-19/weather has now turned into a structural problem thanks to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We do not really see the situation resolving anytime soon, and hence, assume crude prices of $85/bbl for FY23E,” ICICI Securities wrote in its report. Motilal Oswal Securities wrote: “Crude prices will remain at record highs given the fundamental disconnect of the market. Global energy inventories remain low as energy producers significantly cut their spending over the past several years, resulting in lower supply.” “Demand for energy continues to rebound and is closer to pre-pandemic levels. The resulting supply and demand imbalance is fertile ground for a sustained period of higher prices to $110 in coming sessions,’’ added Motilal Oswal. Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley also trimmed India’s growth forecast for the next two fiscal years by 30 basis points due to a global slowdown and surging oil prices.

4,Exports up 30.7% to $40.19 billion in April; trade deficit widens to $20.11 billion,economy," India's merchandise exports surged 30.7 per cent to USD 40.19 billion in April on account of healthy performance by sectors like petroleum products, electronic goods and chemicals, even as trade deficit widened to USD 20.11 billion during the month, the commerce ministry said on Friday. Imports during the month under review grew by 30.97 per cent to USD 60.3 billion. The trade deficit in April 2021 was at USD 15.29 billion. ""After a record performance in the last financial year, the exports continued robust growth in April, 2022 with merchandise exports scaling a new high by crossing USD 40 billion,"" it said. Petroleum and crude oil imports during the month rose by 87.54 per cent to USD 20.2 billion. Coal, Coke and Briquettes imports jumped to USD 4.93 billion, as against USD 2 billion in April 2021. Gold imports, however, dipped by about 72 per cent to USD 1.72 billion during the month under review, from USD 6.23 billion in April 2021.

7,US Senate set to confirm Jerome Powell for second term as Federal Reserve chief,economy," The US Senate was poised Thursday to confirm Jerome Powell to a second term as head of the Federal Reserve, as the central bank works to crush soaring inflation. The vote will come as inflation has hit a 40-year high, fueled by the conflict in Ukraine and ensuing sanctions imposed on Russia, as well as Covid-19 restrictions in China that have raised concerns the global supply snarls may worsen. Powell, a Republican who enjoys broad bipartisan support, has continued at the helm of the central bank although his first term officially expired February 4. His confirmation was delayed by a drawn-out process to approve Lisa Cook to join the Fed board -- the first Black woman to serve in the post -- who was finally confirmed on Tuesday with only Democratic votes. The vote on Powell comes the day after the upper house of Congress approved the nomination of Philip Jefferson of Davidson College, marking the first time the Fed board has had more than one Black governor. US President Joe Biden, whose popularity has taken a hit from the soaring inflation and record gasoline prices, has said repeatedly that tackling the issue is primarily a job for the Fed. ""I put forward highly qualified nominees to lead that institution, and I strongly urge the Senate to confirm them without delay,"" he said Tuesday. Powell led the central bank as is slashed the benchmark interest rate to zero at the start of the pandemic in March 2020 and pumped money into the financial system to prevent a severe downturn in the world's largest economy, and is now overseeing efforts to cool price pressures impacting American families. The Fed last week announced its largest rate hike since 2000 and signaled similar increases were likely in the coming months. The challenge for Powell and the Fed is to turn down the heat on inflation without tipping the United States into recession, but he has expressed confidence that the economy is strong enough to withstand the tighter monetary policy. With the latest additions, the Fed board will be just one short of its full complement of seven governors. Cook and Jefferson each have researched inequality in the labor market. Powell has repeatedly stressed the importance of ensuring economic opportunities extend to disadvantaged groups -- a notable change of focus in an economy where Black workers face far higher unemployment rates than other racial groups. Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University, has focused her research on how discrimination has harmed the American economy and the damage downturns do to the poor.

8,Experts say MPC's June 6-8 meet 'super live' for rate hike after April inflation shocker,economy," The higher-than-expected retail inflation print for April has sent tongues wagging, with experts seeing the June 6-8 meeting of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as ""super live"" for another repo rate hike. Data released on May 12 by the statistics ministry showed Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation soared to 7.79 percent in April - the highest since May 2014. Not only is the April inflation number sharply higher than it was in March, it is also above economists' expectations of 7.5 percent. With core inflation also surging to 7.0 percent from 6.4 percent in March, economists see the repo rate being raised again on June 8. ""We see June's policy to be super-live, and the MPC may front-load rates by another 25-40 basis points,"" said Madhavi Arora, lead economist at Emkay Global Financial Services. Rahul Bajoria of Barclays was even more hawkish, saying the repo rate could be raised by 50 basis points on June 8. ""Our calculations suggest that inflation could remain above the RBI's target band for three consecutive quarters (Q1-Q3 2022), marking the first official 'failure' of the monetary framework,"" the economist said. The MPC is said to have failed if average CPI inflation is outside the mandated 2-6 percent band for three consecutive quarters. Inflation averaged 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2022, meaning 6 percent-plus inflation in April-June and July-September will see the MPC fail to meet its mandate. Bajoria expects the MPC to vote in favour of a 50-basis-point hike in June and follow it up with a 25-basis-point hike in August. Aditi Nayar, ICRA's chief economist, expects the repo rate to be raised by 40 basis points in June and 35 basis points in August. Several economists see the repo rate at 5.15 percent after the August meeting of the MPC. This would mean the policy rate would have returned to its pre-pandemic level by the middle of FY23, with further rate hikes possible. However, not everyone is of the opinion that the RBI must raise interest rates as rapidly. ""Considering weak growth and relatively stable core inflation (6-6.5 percent) expectation, we argue that India should resist aggressive and deep rate hike cycle,"" noted Nikhil Gupta, chief economist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services. According to Gupta, while CPI inflation came in higher-than-expected in April, the underlying numbers are ""not as concerning"". One of the reasons why Gupta is opposed to a rapid increase in the repo rate is that imported inflation rose to 19.6 percent in April, with his calculations showing it contributed 2 percentage points to the headline CPI inflation number. ""It means the domestically generated inflation was 6.4 percent last month,"" Gupta argued. The statistics ministry also released industrial growth data on May 12, which edged up to 1.9 percent in March from 1.5 percent in February - an improvement that has not impressed many even though it is the highest in five months. ""IIP for the month of March again showed a dismal performance,"" noted Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings and Research. According to Sinha, India's industrial recovery will continue to face headwinds and will require more policy support. As such, he expects industrial growth, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), to remain in ""low single digits"" in the near term. Multiple economists voiced their concerns about the weakness in capital goods production, which grew a mere 0.7 percent year-on-year in March, down from an annual growth of 2 percent in February.

9,"Inflation hurt rich more than poor in FY22, says Finance Ministry",economy," An hour before the latest data showed retail inflation in April surged to the highest since the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government first took charge in late May 2014, the finance ministry looked to ease concerns that the poorer sections of society were being hit the worst by elevated inflation. Writing in the monthly economic review report for April, the ministry's officials said the poor were hurt less by higher prices in FY22 as compared to the rich. ""Evidence on consumption patterns further suggests that inflation in India has a lesser impact on low-income strata than on high-income groups,"" the finance ministry said in the report, released on May 12. The ministry's findings are seemingly at odds with comments made last week by Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das. In his statement announcing the surprise 40-basis-point repo rate hike on May 4, Das had said sustained high inflation has ""pronounced adverse effects on the poorer segments of the population by eroding their purchasing power"". In its review report, the finance ministry used data from the 2011-12 National Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure to arrive at its conclusions. It classified the Indian consumer into three broad classes: the top 20 percent, the middle 60 percent, and the bottom 20 percent. Further, their expenditure was also categorised into three classes: food and beverages, fuel and light (including transportation), and items excluding food and fuel. Combining the expenditure classes with their respective inflation numbers for the last two years, the finance ministry was able to compute the 'effective headline inflation' for the three expenditure classes in urban and rural Indians. The results are as follows: i) Inflation for the bottom 20 percent of rural consumers decreased to 5.2 percent in FY22 from 6.0 percent in FY21. For their urban counterparts, inflation fell to 5.7 percent from 6.8 percent ii) Inflation for the middle 60 percent of rural consumers decreased to 5.3 percent in FY22 from 5.9 percent in FY21. For their urban counterparts, inflation fell to 5.7 percent from 6.8 percent iii) Inflation for the top 20 percent of rural consumers increased to 5.6 percent in FY22 from 5.5 percent in FY21. For their urban counterparts, inflation fell to 5.7 percent from 6.5 percent ""Therefore, it can be inferred from the above analysis that lower inflation has reinforced the favorable redistribution of the income from top to bottom and middle-income group,"" the finance ministry said. Meanwhile, data released just an hour later on May 12 by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation showed Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation surged to 7.79 percent in April. Interestingly, the data showed rural inflation in April was 8.38 percent - the highest in exactly eight years.

10,Industrial growth edges up to 1.9% in March on the back of slowdown in core sectors,economy," India's industrial growth, as per the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), edged up to 1.9 percent in March from 1.5 percent in February, data released on May 12 by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation showed. Industrial growth was not expected to show significant improvement in March after data released on April 29 showed the output of India's eight core sectors increased by 4.3 percent year-on-year in the last month of FY22, down from 6 percent the previous month. With the eight core industries accounting for 40.3 percent of the total weight of IIP, industrial growth as per the IIP tracks the performance of these core sectors. The meagre pick-up in industrial growth in March was matched by the manufacturing sector, whose output rose by 0.9 percent, slightly up from an increase of 0.5 percent posted in February. The other two sectors - mining and electricity - saw their fortunes move in opposite directions. While electricity production grew at a faster rate of 6.1 percent, growth in mining output declined to 4.0 percent from 4.5 percent in February. Specifically, the production of capital goods was up a mere 0.7 percent year-on-year in March, down from an annual growth of 2.0 percent in February. ""The bleak three-month low 0.7 percent growth in capital goods output in March 2022 doesn't bode well for a pickup in investment activity in Q4 FY22,"" warned Aditi Nayar, ICRA's chief economist. The fall in the growth of capital goods production will be a matter of concern for policymakers, who hope higher public capital expenditure will lead the way for India's economic recovery.

11,Consumer price inflation surges to near-8-year high at 7.79% in April,economy," The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) worst fears have been realised after data showed headline retail inflation surged to 7.79 percent in April - the highest since May 2014. At 7.79 percent, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation print for April is 84 basis points higher than the March number of 6.95 percent, data released on May 12 by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation showed. Inflation was expected to rise sharply last month. However, the print for April is higher than the already elevated consensus estimate, with a Moneycontrol poll showing economists saw inflation rising to 7.5 percent. Markets have been dreading for the last week what the latest inflation number might be after the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of a 40-basis-point repo rate hike on May 4 at the conclusion of an unscheduled meeting. In his statement conveying the decision on May 4, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said inflation was ""expected to be elevated"" in April. Food and fuel The sharp rise in inflation in April was driven by significant price pressures. As expected, fuel items led the charge, with the index for the 'fuel and light' group of the CPI rising 3.1 percent month-on-month in April, resulting in an inflation rate of 10.8 percent. April saw a big up-tick in fuel prices, with the average pump price of petrol in India's top four metropolitan cities up 8.6-9 percent compared to March. Meanwhile, diesel prices were up 8.8-9.7 percent, according to data from the Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell, a division of the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas. The other volatile component of the CPI basket - food - also registered a higher inflation rate of 8.38 percent in April, up from 7.68 percent in March. However, sequential prices pressures for food items as a whole were not as strong as for fuel, with the Consumer Food Price Index 1.6 percent higher in April compared to March. Core pressures While inflationary pressures from food and fuel items was expected, a third source of risk took charge in April - discretionary items. Inflation for the 'miscellaneous' group, which accounts for 28 percent of the CPI and includes services, rose by more than a percentage point to 8.03 percent in April from 7.02 percent in March. Consequently, core inflation - seen as an indicator of underlying demand - jumped to 7.0 percent in April from 6.4 percent in March, according to Moneycontrol calculations. ""The surge in the CPI inflation has clearly justified the off-cycle rate hike last week, and significantly raised the likelihood of a back-to-back rate increase in June 2022,"" said Aditi Nayar, ICRA's chief economist. ""We now foresee a high likelihood that the MPC will raise the repo rate by 40 basis points and 35 basis points, respectively, over the next two policies to 5.15 percent, followed by a pause to assess the impact of growth. As of now, we continue to see the terminal rate at 5.5 percent by the middle of 2023,"" Nayar added. Nayar sees a favourable base lowering CPI inflation in May, although it is expected to remain above 6.5 percent.

12,India to send trade delegations to 9 countries to boost wheat exports,economy," India will soon be sending trade delegations to at least nine wheat importing nations to explore the possibilities of boosting wheat exports. The move comes amid widespread loss of yield in major wheat growing states, and low response to public procurement by farmers who continue to sell at much higher prices to traders. The Centre will send trade delegations to Morocco, Tunisia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, Algeria, and Lebanon to promote Indian wheat, the Commerce and Industry Ministry said on May 12. The move is part of the government's efforts to export 10 million tonnes of wheat in 2022-23, amid rising global demand, it said. Not more than 10 days after the Ukraine crisis began, the Centre began discussions with various countries, including Egypt, Turkey, China, Bosnia, Sudan, Nigeria and Iran on commencing wheat exports. Initial shipments have also begun to some of these nations. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), under the Commerce & Industry Ministry, has also planned to organize a series of sensitization meetings on exports in major wheat-growing states such as Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, it said. APEDA has set up a task force on wheat exports that include officials from various ministries such as Shipping and railways, and exporters. APEDA officials said that Indian farmers, traders and exporters have been advised to follow all the quality norms of importing countries so that India emerges as a reliable supplier of wheat globally. Exports moving ahead According to estimates by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), India has exported a record seven million tonne (MT) of wheat in 2021-22, which is valued at $2.05 billion. Out of the total shipment, around 50 percent of wheat was exported to Bangladesh in the last fiscal. Recently, Egypt, which is one of the world’s biggest importers of wheat, had agreed to source wheat from India. Egyptian authorities have now allowed India into the list of accredited countries which can export wheat to the country. Egypt imported 6.1 MT of wheat in 2021, of which 80 percent were from Russia and Ukraine. APEDA has already communicated to exporters to register with Egypt’s public procurement agency – General Authority of Supplies and Commodities, which manages wheat and sugar imports to the north African country. In April, domestic wholesale wheat prices rose to a decadal high. Prices have risen by 5-7 percent in March and April. However, they are yet to catch up with the export prices, which remain at record highs. Slow procurement Currently, farmers are not willing to sell to the government since the procurement prices being offered by private traders and exporters are much higher, multiple traders in the wheat exporting hub of Ahmedabad said. Last week, the government revised its wheat production estimate for the 2021-22 crop year (July 2021-June 2022) downwards by 5.7 percent. National production is now estimated to be 105 million tonnes, down from 111.5 million tonnes. As a result of heatwave conditions in March, both the quality and weight of output suffered in Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. These states have reported a fall in yield by up to 15 percent as sudden changes in temperature and climatic conditions have led to the grains shrivelling. For the ongoing 2021-22 crop year, the government had last year hiked the minimum support price (MSP) for wheat by Rs 40 to Rs 2,015 per quintal. The MSP, however, is way lower than the going rate of Rs 2,400-2,500 per quintal as of February 11 at most major wholesale markets across the country. As a result of this and the flurry of exports, the procurement target for the 2022-23 wheat marketing year (April-March) has also fallen to 19.5 million tonnes, down from the earlier target of 44 million tonnes. As of May 8, procurement by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and other government agencies stood at 17.5 million tonnes.

13,UK economic growth slows in first quarter,economy," Britain's economy grew at a slower pace in the first quarter compared with the final three months of last year as the country battled soaring inflation, official data showed Thursday. The economy grew 0.8 percent in the January-March period compared with expansion of 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the Office for National Statistics said in a statement. After solid output in January, the UK economy posted zero growth the following month and contracted by 0.1 percent in March, ONS data showed. It comes after the Bank of England (BoE) last week warned that Britain risks falling into recession with UK inflation expected to top 10 percent, a four-decade high, by the end of the year. Consumer prices are surging worldwide on supply strains as economies reopen from pandemic lockdowns -- and in the wake of the Ukraine war that is aggravating already high energy costs. Russia disruption Responding to Thursday's data, finance minister Rishi Sunak said Britain's economic recovery from the pandemic was ""being disrupted by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine and other global challenges"". Sunak, however, added in a statement that UK ""growth in the first few months of the year was strong, faster than the US, Germany and Italy"". While the UK economy grew for a fourth quarter in a row, and is above pre-pandemic levels, output in the first three months of 2022 was the lowest for a year. ""Our latest monthly estimates show GDP fell a little in March, with drops in both services and in production,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""Construction, though, saw a strong month, thanks partly to repair work after the February storms."" Growth over the entire first quarter was driven by expansion in a number of service sectors, including hospitality and transport, Morgan added. However, the contraction in March and slower first-quarter output as a whole ""suggest the economy had less momentum than we thought even before the full hit from the cost-of-living crisis has been felt"", noted Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""The risk of recession has just risen,"" he said, adding that ""strong price pressures will probably mean the BoE will raise interest rates further"". The Bank of England last week raised its main interest rate by a quarter point to one percent to tackle runaway UK inflation. It was the fourth straight increase by the BoE, while its key rate now stands at the highest level since the global financial crisis in 2009. That is hiking borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, further impacting spending. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "

If the world’s second-largest economy shows any sign of recovery from its COVID-induced slump, Wang Neng should be among the first to know.

But so far, he sees few indications of that. Like many small businesses in China, Wang’s cement mixing station in central Henan province has been hit hard by controversial lockdowns in dozens of cities ordered by President Xi Jinping to stamp out outbreaks of the Omicron variant.

15,75 Indian villages to be shaped with Israeli cooperation: Agriculture minister,economy," Taking to the ""next level"" the Indo-Israel cooperation in the field of agriculture, 75 Indian villages will be shaped with Israeli cooperation to mark the country's 75th Independence anniversary, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has said here. Tomar, who was in Israel on a four-day official visit from May 8, met his Israeli counterpart Oded Forer at the Knesset (Israel's Parliament) on Wednesday. They discussed various issues related to modern agro techniques, capacity building, transfer of knowledge know-how and support in the fields of agriculture, water management, environment and rural development, keeping in view the scope and potential of agriculture development in both the countries, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare said in a statement. As India and Israel celebrate 30 years of establishment of diplomatic relations, the ongoing bilateral partnership would be further strengthened through ""mutual visits and sharing of experiences"", the visiting minister said. Tomar said as India celebrates its 75th Independence anniversary this year, ""it has been decided that we will shape up 75 villages of excellence with Israeli collaboration and another 75 to follow thereafter"". Forer expressed Israel's desire to take the Centres of Excellence (CoE) established by his country in different parts of India to the ""next level"". There are currently 29 fully operational Centres of Excellence in India providing vital information on emerging technologies in the agriculture sector to boost farmers' yield. Trade relations between the two countries would also get a boost in the near future, the Israeli agriculture minister said. India and Israel have agreed to complete the process of finalising a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) by the end of June this year. This was agreed upon during a meeting between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid in October last year during Jaishankar's visit to Israel. A delegation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare led by Tomar held extensive discussions with premier institutes and technology companies in the field of agriculture and horticulture. The delegation visited facilities of Green 2000 - Agricultural Equipment and Know How Ltd. and NETAFIM Ltd. which are engaged in planning, set-up, consultation and on-going management of various projects in micro and smart Irrigation across the globe. ""Learning about application of technology and innovative procedures in farming with focus on high value crops, vegetables and fruits were the highlights of the visit"", the delegation said. Tomar also had a roundtable discussion with more than half a dozen Israeli Agritech Startups at Israel Export and International Cooperation Institute. He extended an invite to the companies to work in India. The delegation visited the Agricultural Research Organisation (ARO), Volcani Institute known for its expertise in agriculture under arid conditions, on lacklustre soils, irrigation through effluent and saline water and minimisation of post harvest losses by using latest pest control and storage methods. Tomar also held a long interaction with the institute's post-doctoral fellows from India. Use of drone technology with the combination of advanced mapping and photography was demonstrated at Ganei Khna'an, near Kibbutz Naan, for the Indian delegation during the visit. Tomar interacted with the ARO experts on various issues related to technological advancements in agriculture in Indian context, the Ministry of Agriculture said in the statement. The issues of deliberations include crop cultivation in protected environments, freshwater fish farming, advanced plant protection techniques, precision agriculture, remote sensing and post harvest science and technology among others, it said. The minister also visited a farm owned by an Indian-origin farmer Sharon Cherry growing Indian vegetables in the Negev desert area. The farmer owns a desert boutique farm, Be'er Milka, in the Negev desert area. He has adopted modern technologies with the technical support of Ramat Negev Agro Research Centre and is growing vegetables, fruits and super food in the heart of Negev desert, the ministry said in the statement. ""Cherry exhibited excellence in growing Indian vegetables in extremely harsh terrain and climatic conditions with the technical support of Ramat Negev Agro Research Centre in the desert area"", the delegation told PTI. The delegation also held discussions with a team from MASHAV, the agency for International Development Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel.

16,"Unscheduled meetings, debates: Behind the scenes of the May 4 surprise RBI repo rate hike",economy," The Reserve Bank of India is said to have started discussions on holding a Monetary Policy Committee meeting before the scheduled date of June 6 as soon as inflation data for March was released on April 12 – just four days after the panel had voted to leave the repo rate unchanged at 4 percent. The data, which showed that the Consumer Price Index inflation surpassed forecast to a 17-month high of 6.95 percent in March, raised expectation that the RBI would increase the reverse repo rate, tighten its monetary policy stance, or even raise the repo rate at its June 6-8 meeting. However, the RBI tweeted just before noon on May 4 that Governor Shaktikanta Das would be making a statement in a couple of hours, fuelling talks of a policy rate hike. The governor delivered, but more than expected, announcing that the MPC had met and voted in favour of a 40-basis-point hike in the repo rate. ""From the time the March inflation number was released, the six (MPC) members were talking to each other, asking if an early meeting was needed,"" a person aware of the developments said, requesting anonymity. ""Only if there is a consensus does the MPC meet."" The RBI debated the optics of holding the MPC meeting as early as April 13. But such a move was seen as being ""very, very backward,"" the person said. The MPC members held telephonic conversations and decided to wait until the views of the International Monetary Fund were available, with the multilateral agency's World Economic Outlook report due for release on April 19. In its report, the IMF forecast India's CPI inflation at 6.1 percent in FY23, 40 basis points higher than the RBI estimate released on April 8. The central bank is expected to raise its CPI inflation forecast in June. Currently, the RBI expects the CPI inflation to average 5.7 percent in FY23, although the MPC said in its resolution on May 4 that there were ""significant upside risks"" to the inflation trajectory announced in April. New member Another consideration that helped advance the MPC meeting to early May was the nomination of the central bank's newly minted executive director, Rajiv Ranjan, to the panel. The RBI's central board of directors met on May 2 and approved Ranjan as the MPC's third ex-officio member. The three RBI representatives on the MPC are all ex-officio. While the first two are the governor and the deputy governor in charge of monetary policy, the third can be any officer of the RBI, as nominated by its board of directors. Ranjan joined the MPC after his elevation to the post of executive director on May 1, with a nomination necessitated to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Mridul Saggar at the end of April. Saggar served as a member of the MPC from August 2020 until last month's meeting. ""The RBI has a tradition of asking the head of the Monetary Policy Department or its executive director to be a member of the MPC. So, it waited for Ranjan's appointment,"" the person said.

17,"RBI's forex reserves formidable, but futile to resist global tide against currencies, says source",economy," The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sees the current depreciation of the rupee as part of a ""broader trend"" and thinks it will be ""futile"" to defend the Indian currency against a ""global tide"", according to a person familiar with the central bank's thinking. ""There are certain factors, like global spillovers, which the RBI can do very little about. India is a price-taking country. It will be futile if the RBI tries to resist a global tide,"" the person said, requesting anonymity. ""But if there are country-specific factors, then the RBI has formidable reserves."" The comments come after the Indian currency weakened to an all-time low against the dollar on May 9, with the US Federal Reserve having raised the federal funds rate target range by 50 basis points last week. In response, yield on the 10-year US government bond crossed 3 percent on May 5. ""There is a 'fly home' bias now,"" the person noted, commenting on the outflow of foreign capital from certain countries. The RBI has been actively intervening in the foreign exchange market in recent days to reduce volatility in the rupee's exchange rate. As always, the central bank has no specific level for the exchange rate in mind and is more concerned with intra-day movements being limited to a ""certain number of paise"", the person quoted above said. The RBI's foreign exchange reserves have declined in recent weeks to $597.73 billion as on April 29. According to the person quoted above, the fall in the reserves was not because of the RBI's actions in the foreign exchange market but due to the valuation losses of the central bank's non-dollar assets. The RBI's foreign exchange reserves are held in assets denominated in various currencies. While the US dollar is the largest component, its appreciation against these other currencies - such as the euro, the yen, or British pound - means a fall in the value of these currencies in dollar terms and consequently a decline in the RBI's foreign exchange reserves, which are measured in dollars.

18,The roots of the Sri Lankan crisis and the lessons to be learnt,economy," Sri Lanka is in deep economic and political turmoil. The protests against the government have turned violent, the prime minister’s house has been torched, politicians are being hunted down and the central bank governor has threatened to quit.

There are good reasons for the masses to lose patience. The country’s citizens face 12-hour power cuts, long queues for fuel and essential items such as medicines are unavailable. Inflation was a massive 21.5 percent in March 2022, with food prices rising..."
19,"Yields are hardening, what does the future hold for Indian bond market?",economy," Sovereign bond yields, which have been gradually moving up since the second half of the last fiscal year, have started to rise at a much faster pace this fiscal year. Upward pressure has intensified post an off-cycle 40 bps rate hike by the MPC earlier this month, with a signal that a hiking cycle is in the offing, as headline CPI inflation is likely to remain well above 6% - the upper band of target range – in the..."
20,RBI may up inflation forecast in next MPC meeting; rate hike on cards: Sources,economy," The Reserve Bank is likely to raise inflation projections in the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting next month and would also consider a rate hike to tame inflation which is above its comfort level, sources said. The MPC, headed by the RBI Governor, is scheduled to meet between June 6 and June 8. It has been mandated to keep retail inflation in the range of 2-6 per cent. Sources said the MPC would review the inflation scenario in the next meeting. The MPC had not changed inflation projections in an off-cycle meeting earlier this month. However, last month RBI had sharply raised its inflation projection for the current fiscal year to 5.7 per cent from the earlier forecast of 4.5 per cent due to geopolitical tensions. ""Taking into account these factors and on the assumption of a normal monsoon in 2022 and average crude oil price (Indian basket) of USD 100 per barrel, inflation is now projected at 5.7 per cent in 2022-23, with Q1 at 6.3 per cent; Q2 at 5.8 per cent; Q3 at 5.4 per cent; and Q4 at 5.1 per cent,"" RBI had said. With regard to a rate hike in the upcoming MPC meeting, sources said it is expected but the quantum would depend on various inputs. Following its off-cycle MPC meeting during May 2-4, the Reserve Bank announced a hike in the key repo rate -- at which it lends short term money to banks -- by 0.40 per cent to 4.40 per cent.

21,"Power ministry tells PFC, REC to support imported coal-based, stressed units with short term funds",economy," The ministry of power has directed state-run power sector lenders, Power Finance Corporation Ltd (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd (REC) to help arrange short-term loans for a period of six months for imported coal-based power plants and plants that are undergoing the bankruptcy process to revive generation. The ministry has been trying to get all power units, including stressed units, that are generating below full capacity or lying idle to produce power to supplement the current generation to meet the steep rise in demand for power. Around 7,600 megawatts of imported coal based-plants are not running as they would incur losses at the current levels of coal price. “These directions would ensure that additional electricity is produced through imported coal and will be a net addition. Since domestic coal supply is constrained, therefore, it is imperative that all ICB (imported coal based) plants should run to meet the power requirements,” the ministry said in a letter to PFC and REC on May 11. India’s power demand hit an all-time high of 207.1 gigawatts (GW) on April 29, driven by a spike in demand from households amid an ongoing heatwave and a pick-up in industrial demand even as power units scrambled for fuel, leading to many states being forced to undertake power. Moneycontrol had reported on May 7 that the power and renewable energy minister RK Singh met power generation companies (gencos), discoms, and lenders, along with senior officials from different ministries to work out a plan to resolve issues relating to non-payment of dues by discoms to increase power generations, especially from stressed units. “To restart their operations, the ICB plants which are under stress or in NCLT need working capital to buy coal and start generating power. In view of the above, it is directed to take necessary action to arrange short term loans for a period of six months with adequate safeguards, for such plants at the earliest,” the ministry said. The power distribution companies (discoms) owe gencos over Rs 1.1 lakh crore, which has hurt their cash flow and their ability to buy coal to generate power. The ministry’s latest direction comes after the power generators said they are not being paid on time and would not be able to pay for imported coal to scale up generation, as directed by the ministry.

22,"RBI data dependent, each MPC meeting should be seen as 'mutually independent'",economy," Successive meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) are not linked to each other and only the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) inflation forecasts at each meeting would determine the interest rate decision, according to a person familiar with the matter. ""Each monetary policy action should be treated on its own merits and as mutually independent. Each time it will be based on the forecast. We shouldn't try to second guess (what the MPC will do),"" the person said on the condition of anonymity. The RBI's surprise decision to raise the repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.40 percent on May 4 has led to talk in the market that further rate action is guaranteed at the conclusion of the MPC's next meeting, scheduled for June 6-8. This belief has been reinforced by expectations of headline retail inflation jumping to around 7.5 percent in April, data for which will be released on May 12. Economists have penciled in a repo rate hike of anywhere between 25 basis points and 50 basis points on June 8. But, according to the person quoted above, the entire matter hinges on the RBI's inflation forecast. ""The whole framework of inflation targeting is based on forecast targeting. If the forecast suggests that the tolerance band is being breached big time, the RBI obviously will have to act because it knows its interest rate measures today will have an impact only 6-8 months down the line. But if the forecasts are benign, why should it act?"" the person said. ""What will happen in June will be decided by the June forecast."" Pandemic reversal In his statement on May 4, Governor Shaktikanta Das had said the 40-basis-point repo rate hike should be seen ""as a reversal of the rate action of May 22, 2020"". Two years ago, in an outside-the-schedule move, the MPC had voted to cut the repo rate by 40 basis points to 4 percent. This followed another unscheduled meeting of the rate-setting panel in March 2020, which had resulted in a decision to cut the repo rate by a massive 75 basis points. As such, speculation has been rife that the repo rate could be hiked by 75 basis points in the next couple of meetings, which would complete the reversal of the rate cuts made during the pandemic. However, the person familiar with the central bank's thinking said the reversal of the pandemic-related support measures, including the rate cuts and the stance of monetary policy, could take 1-2 years. Commenting on the stance of monetary policy, the person said it could remain in its current form ""till the ultra-accommodation is off"". The May 4 resolution of the MPC retained the language on the stance on remaining ""accommodative while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward while supporting growth"". ""First, the RBI needs to remove the pandemic measures. There is Rs 6.5 lakh crore coming into the Liquidity Adjustment Facility every day. No power on earth can withdraw that in a day. It has to be a multi-year process, maybe Rs 2 lakh crore at a time. A 50-basis-point hike in the Cash Reserve Ratio (announced on May 4) only removed Rs 87,000 crore,"" the person said.

23,No serious risk seen to RBI reputation if MPC fails to meet inflation mandate,economy," Failure to meet the inflation mandate will not lead to any ""reputational risk"" for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), according to a person familiar with the developments. ""That the RBI has to explain itself, I would say that's a very positive thing. It is not a serious reputational risk. It is just an event,"" the person said on the condition of anonymity. According to the person, the central bank is currently conducting monetary policy ""as if it (failure) should not happen"". ""If it happens, it is a good thing… a public authority, however tall, is accountable to the people,"" the person added. The MPC is deemed to have failed if average Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is outside the band of 2-6 percent for three consecutive quarters. As per the law, if the RBI fails to meet the inflation target, it must submit a report to the central government – commonly referred to as 'the letter' – spelling out the reasons for failure, the remedial actions it proposes to take, and an estimate of the time period within which inflation will return to target. Data released last month saw CPI inflation jump to a 17-month high of 6.95 percent in March. This took the average for the first quarter of 2022 to 6.3 percent. As such, 6 percent-plus inflation in April-June and July-September will see the MPC fail to meet its mandate. Inflation data for April will be released on May 12, with economists expecting it to have surged further to around 7.5 percent. The RBI's most recent forecast pegs average CPI inflation at 6.3 percent in April-June, 5.8 percent in July-September, and 5.7 percent for FY23. These numbers will, in all likelihood, likely be revised upwards when the MPC's next resolution is released on June 8. ""You will certainly get a revised inflation forecast in June. The RBI didn't want to start off-cycle forecasting, which is why the latest MPC resolution didn't contain inflation forecast numbers,"" the person quoted above said, referring to the 40-basis-point repo rate hike announced on May 4. Accountability no celebration While the RBI welcomes being held accountable for its monetary policy, the person warned of what may come after in case the inflation mandate is not met and the central bank has to submit a report to the government, which must include – as mentioned above – what the RBI plans to do about the inflation situation. ""The RBI will use the sledgehammer. If the RBI decides to bring inflation back (to mandated levels) in six months, it will be sledgehammer plus sledgehammer. So, accountability should be taken with a pinch of salt and not as something to celebrate. We will all rue the day the RBI writes the letter,"" the person said. The person also added that the experience of other countries had shown that reports submitted to the government after failing to meet the inflation mandate ""don't do anything"".

24,Step up exports to meet $1-trillion economy by 2030: Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin,economy," Asserting that exports are very crucial to achieve economic growth, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin on Wednesday called upon the captains of industries to step up the exports by about $ 100 billion and meet the government’s ambitious target of achieving $ one trillion dollar economy by 2030. At present, Tamil Nadu’s share on the export front stood at $ 26 billion and this should be increased to $ 100 billion by 2030, he said after presenting the FIEO Southern Region Export Excellence Awards. His government has already initiated several measures to attain the objective, he said at the event held under the aegis of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO). ""I had unveiled plans in September last year on export promotion and the government is taking several steps in this direction. To name some, efforts are on to establish a Knowledge City, State Export Promotion Committee, and International Furniture Park,” Stalin said. He gave away the FIEO awards in the presence of Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu and MSME Minister T M Anbarasan. The event saw the participation of top business leaders from various industries and awards were presented in multiple categories, including highest foreign exchange earner (top exporter) in southern region, top five-star exporter in southern region, top four-star exporter in southern region, among others. ""I am happy to inform that during 2020-21 fiscal, Tamil Nadu stood third in the country by exporting to the tune of Rs 1.93 lakh crore, contributing 8.97 per cent to the nation’s overall exports. This share should be increased every year. This government’s desire and also my ambition is make Tamil Nadu first among Indian States in exports,” the Chief Minister said. ""Exports are very crucial to achieve economic growth. Currently, the southern zone has a share of about 27 per cent in India’s exports. I am sure in five years, this will increase to 35 per cent,” the Chief Minister said. FIEO should ensure the Central government scheme of One District One Product (ODOP) is implemented in all the districts in Tamil Nadu, he said and pointed out that nearly 24 of the State’s unique products such as Thanjavur painting, Coimbatore’s Kota cotton saree, Kovilpatti’s peanut candy, and Salem silk are awaiting geographical indication (GI) tag. These products have good export potential, he added. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
