9,Buy Ajanta Pharma; target of Rs 2350: YES Securities,stocks," YES Securities' research report on Ajanta Pharma Ajanta clocked 15% growth in 4Q, higher than our 4% forecast driven by resilient performance in India business along with strong performance in branded business. Margins during the quarter were impacted due to one-time write off of certain products and high price erosion in US. Increased raw material prices also impacted margins but the company is still sure of maintaining 75% gross margin in FY23. US business is expected to pick up once the FDA commences inspections of various facilities as company is sitting on a healthy pipeline awaiting approvals. Branded business is expected to grow in mid-teens despite having a high base. R&D spends have gone back to pre-Covid levels while working capital is on the higher side but could be new normal as US share in revenues inches up compared to previous years.  Outlook Reduced FY24 estimate lead to corresponding cut in TP to Rs2,350 (earlier Rs2,620) though BUY stays based on unchanged 26x PE. Key trigger would be a successful FDA inspection which would open up approval to several important products.

10,Buy Gujarat Gas; target of Rs 650: YES Securities,stocks," YES Securities' research report on Gujarat Gas The 4QFY22 reported Ebitda at Rs 6.97bn (+26% YoY; 194% QoQ), stood in-line with our estimates. The sharp sequential improvement in operating profits was driven by a) optimization and tempering of gas sales to limit dependence on expensive LNG and b) price revision undertaken in CNG and PNG-Domestic. During the quarter on one hand LNG prices continued to be high and averaged ~USD 31/mmbtu (3Q: USD 35/mmbtu) and on the other hand APM availability remained restricted, as a result GUJGA moderated sales leading to a 13% QoQ and 18% YoY drop in sales to 9.9mmscmd, in order to protect margins . As a result Ebitda/unit expanded to Rs 7.8/scm (3Q: Rs 2.27/scm), leading to stronger profitability.  Outlook However moving into 1QFY23, the demand environment remains robust, with appetite for expensive gas among consumers, as result GUJGA has normalized gas sales to 10.5-11mmscmd, and has also revised the prices for Industrial consumer (by ~Rs 5/unit) , CNG (Rs 2.5/unit) and PNG-D (Rs 4/unit), to keep margins steady. We upgrade GUJGA to BUY with a TP of Rs 650/sh.

11,Buy Asian Paints; target of Rs 3708: YES Securities,stocks," YES Securities' research report on Asian Paints Asian Paints (APNT) once again delivered a strong performance in a challenging environment with 8% volume growth on base of 48% volume growth despite a soft performance in January. Value growth stood at 21%; higher value growth was on account of price increases partially offset by deterioration in product mix. Growth was uniform for the company with strongest growth in West and East markets. The company is witnessing strong double‐digit growth in Tier 1 and 2 cities led by luxury and premium range, while tier 3 and 4 markets delivering growth in economy range. APNT has been aggressive in launching new products which now contribute 14% to the revenue. It is also aggressively expanding its home décor foray with extended offering across the product categories like kitchen, bath, sanitary ware, lighting, tiles, flooring, furniture, furnishings, doors and windows. APNT is targeting to nearly double its Beautiful Home stores to 70 in FY23. On international front, company saw growth from Asia followed by Middle east while Africa, Ethiopia and Srilanka are seeing impact of currency devaluation. Company is also aggressively expanding its distribution touch points and has added 15,000 retail points in FY22. Considering strong demand momentum despite sharp price hikes, under penetration of paints and opportunities in new segments and services, we feel demand for paints is expected to remain robust in medium term and APNT is in a sweet spot to capture a major chunk of incremental demand.Also, its foray into home décorto broaden its product and service offerings to a large consumer base is expected to make Asian a go to brand in the broader home improvement space. Its pricing power, distribution prowess and balance sheet strength should enable it to ward of any competition that comes in it way. Considering the above, we continue to remain upbeat on the stock and feel premium valuations are justified.  Outlook We expect FY22‐24E Revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 18%/34%/39% respectively and maintain our BUY rating with TP of Rs3,708 valuing it at 60x FY24 EPS.

12,Buy Canara Bank; target of Rs 260: LKP Research,stocks," LKP Research's research report on Canara Bank Canara Bank has been reporting consistent growth in net profit since last eight quarters. A bulky provision (₹54bn) made in 4QFY20 (two years ago), continued to safeguard the balance sheet with PCR (calculated) of 67% and PCR (including TWO) of 84%. The bank’s margin (2.9% in the 4QFY22) is in upward trajectory with continuous improvement in CD ratio. On the business front, the bank has been reporting stable credit growth (2% sequential jump seen in 4QFY22) across segments. The bank’s recoveries are in line with the guidance and we expect the credit cost to be below 2% for FY23. Moreover, the bank has raised capital in FY21 which resulted in the CET -1 of 10.3% (at par); thus we believe the bank may raise capital from stake sales of AMC, HFC and insurance company. We believe the hurdles from merger (with Syndicate Bank) are behind and the bank shall witness gradual improvement in profitability with FY23E ROA/ROE of 1%/16%. Given inexpensive valuation (0.55x PBVPS), we recommend BUY.  Outlook Factoring near term capital infusion, we expect the bank’s loan book to fatten cautiously at CAGR of 9.2% over FY21-23E, led by corporate book growth. In our opinion, the bank’s credit cost will normalise further by FY23E and estimate return ratio ROA/ROE of 1% and 16% in FY23E. We value the standalone entity at 0.6xFY23E BVPS (₹433) and arrive at a target price of ₹260. We recommend BUY with a potential upside of 30%.

Net revenue (NTR), which accrues to the company, improved 15.2% YoY (+8.6% QoQ) to INR 760.0 mn or 6.7 paisa in Q4FY22. However, EBITDA margins declined 628 bps YoY (+253 bps QoQ) to 12.1% in Q4FY22 due to 21.4% YoY (+1.0% QoQ) rise in employee expense in Q4FY22.

20,Buy Federal Bank; target of Rs 115: Anand Rathi,stocks," Anand Rathi's research report on Federal Bank Lower margins, less Treasury income and higher opex led to a ~500bp weakened C/I ratio; moderating provisions, however, counterbalanced the weak operating performance keeping RoA at 1% for Federal bank.
