0,"Titan Company eyes over Rs 1,000 crore in sales from women’s ethnic wear by FY27",companies," Titan Company is eying over Rs 1000 crore in sales from its women’s ethnic wear brand Taneira, which offers products such as sarees, lehangas and other ethnic wear products, the company told investors on May 13 during its annual Investor and Analyst Day. Titan Company also plans to open 125 omnichannel stores and achieve supply chain transformation for the business. It had introduced Taneira stores in 2018; however, the plans to expand the brand were interrupted due to the pandemic. Now, it is giving a renewed push to this range. The company currently operates 15 stores under Taneira. Through Taneira, the company plans to revive the “saree for all consumers including young women,” the company said in its presentation. The retail major has similar plans for the women’s bags category as well and is targeting Rs 1,000 crore in sales from this segment too by FY27. The company plans to open exclusive brand outlets (EBOs) to cater to the segment going ahead besides selling them in department stores. In the ethnic wear segment, Titan Company will be competing with Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail and Reliance Retail, as these companies too have set sights on the women’s ethnic retail segment. ABFRL last year acquired a majority stake in designer label Sabyasachi and a 33 percent stake in another designer label Tarun Tahiliani. Reliance Retail has forayed into the category by launching the ethnic wear brand Avantra. Under its Ambition FY27 plan, Titan Company plans to set up 30 omnichannel stores under Tanishq targeting the Indian diaspora. The company is eying Rs 2,500 crore in sales through this opportunity. Titan Company had earlier this year disclosed its international expansion plans for the jewellery business. The company which houses jewellery brands such as Tanishq, Zoya, Mia and CaratLane, had indicated that the first jewellery store in North America is set to open in May-June 2022 in New Jersey. The company’s focus is going to be on the US, Canada and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, including Qatar and Bahrain, Ajoy Chawla, CEO, jewellery division, Titan Company, had said while addressing an investor call. “We want to become the jeweller brand of choice for the NRI (non-residential Indian), PIO (person of Indian origin) consumers in North America in the next three years and we are doing everything to get there at a fast pace,” he added. Titan company had opened its first international store in Dubai in 2021 under Tanishq, and according to the CEO, after seeing a good response has launched two more stores – one in Dubai and the other in Abu Dhabi. The company also is giving a push to digital under its Ambition FY27 and has prioritised an omnichannel approach, democratising data access, and deep integration with dealers and franchisees.

1,Escorts Q4 Result | Firm's net profit falls 29% YoY to Rs 190 crore,companies," Farm machinery and construction equipment major Escorts Ltd on May 13 reported a 28.5 percent decline in its consolidated net profit at Rs 190 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2022 (Q4FY22).

4,"How Shivakumar uses T20 cricket, aircraft and shopping mall models to offer career advice to professionals",companies," “One can use three analogies to think of life and careers in this decade. The first is what I label the aircraft flight model; the second is the T20 cricket model; and the third is the shopping mall model,” Shiv, as he is popularly called, writes in his new book The Art of Management. Aircraft flight model Aircraft fly at different altitudes and have a clear, specific destination. Having a sense of your destination, of what you could likely become, is important, as well as having a sense of what drives you and your passion, Shiv writes. “Aircraft use and manage jet streams to avoid turbulence and ensure a smooth flight. Life and careers are also like that. You need to use the jet stream in a role to get yourself mileage and then move to the next stream that accelerates your progress,” he writes. He says when one faces dark clouds, one needs to pause and rethink what’s happening to you. For this to happen, you need a few emotional anchors, people you can share your situation with, people who will tell you the raw truth while being empathetic. T20 cricket model T20 is a brutal game. Yesterday’s captain is tomorrow’s twelfth man. This simple lesson in multiple capabilities is something we can apply in life and the corporate world, his writes in the book. “A single-skill cricketer does not have a role in the IPL (Indian Premier League) team, however good he is at the international level. The best Test batsmen who cannot adapt to T20 don’t get picked, but the best bowler still has a chance. Teams tend to pick players with multiple skills—batting, bowling, fielding, wicket-keeping, captaincy. Shopping mall model The third approach I want people to think about in managing their life and career is what I call the shopping mall model. This applies to managers in startup companies, Shiv says. To be fair, this model has been used before in advertising, market research, journalism and consumer electronics, where people tend to move from one door to the next, as in a shopping mall. Professionals tend to shop around for jobs as one shops around in a shopping mall, says the book. “This approach is relevant as long as you have relevant experience and have produced worthwhile results. But the shopping mall approach to a career doesn’t work beyond the middle-management stage,” Shiv says.

6,Govt raises $2.7 billion as LIC prices IPO at Rs 949; listing next week,companies," India raised 205.6 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) as its biggest ever initial public offering priced at the top of the range following strong demand from local investors and a last-minute dash by foreign funds. Life Insurance Corporation of India shares have been priced at 949 rupees each, the state-run firm said in a prospectus filed Friday. LIC shares were offered at 902 rupees to 949 rupees apiece. Trading on the stock exchange is due to begin May 17.  Dubbed India’s “Aramco moment” in reference to Gulf oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s $29.4 billion listing in 2019 -- the world’s largest -- the float of LIC has ended up resembling the Aramco IPO not just in scale but in its reliance on domestic investors after some foreign buyers deemed it too expensive. Foreign institutional investors stepped up their bids for the sale in the last hours before the close of subscription this week, shunning currency risks and global market uncertainties. Besides smashing India’s record as the country’s biggest IPO, LIC’s offering is also the world’s fourth-biggest this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LIC’s debut comes at a time when capital-market activities have significantly slowed globally as the war in Ukraine stokes market volatility and saps investor appetite. Shares of LIC are trading at a discount of about 30 rupees to its IPO price in the so-called gray market, traders told Bloomberg News. The expectation for a strong debut by LIC’s shares is waning as the demand in the unregulated market, where investors bet on listing day gains, has come down over the last few days. Retail investors and LIC policyholders were among the most enthusiastic for the offering, thanks to the discounts they were offered. The portion reserved for them was fully taken up days before the offering was closed. The anchor portion of the IPO drew in sovereign funds from Norway and Singapore while other foreign investors picked up pace only on the last day. Overall, the LIC offer was oversubscribed by nearly three times. The money will help the government bridge a budget deficit that’s expected to widen as commodity prices soar across the world. For the banks working on the IPO, the share sale might not give them large fees but offers glory in the league table rankings, Bloomberg News has reported. The 10 banks on the IPO received a total 118 million rupees as fees, according to the prospectus, a fraction of what they could have typically pocketed for an offering of this size.

7,LIC Housing Finance ups home loan interest rate by 20 bps for select borrowers,companies," Mortgage financier LIC Housing Finance (LIC HFL) on Friday increased interest rate on home loans by 20 basis points to 6.9 per cent, from 6.7 per cent, for select borrowers. For borrowers with CIBIL score of 700 and above, the rate hike has been limited to only 20 bps, LIC Housing Finance said in a statement, adding that the revised rates are applicable from Friday. For customers having CIBIL score (less than 700) maximum hike is 25 basis points (bps). For NTC (New to Credit) customers the hike is 40 bps. CIBIL Score is a 3-digit numeric summary of a customer's credit history. It ranges between 300 to 900. The closer the score is to 900, the better the credit rating is. The increase in the lending rate follows a hike of 40 basis points in the repo rate to 4.40 per cent by the Reserve Bank of India last week. ''RBI has after a long time increased the policy rates and the effect is being seen across the lenders. We have kept our home loan rates competitive despite the increase in the cost of funds to support the aspirations of home buyers,'' LIC HFL's Managing Director and CEO Y Viswanatha Gowd said.

8,"Coming soon: A new cinema near you, courtesy a multiplex screen drive",companies,"  Films are expected to get a wider play in India this fiscal year with the multiplex industry planning to ramp up the number of screens, taking their overall numbers beyond the pre-Covid count. After a slowdown in launches in the last two years because of the pandemic, PVR, Cinepolis India, INOX Leisure and Miraj Cinemas all plan to add more screens. Consequently, the number of multiplex screens is expected to rise from around 3,100 to more than 3,800 by the end of FY23. “Things are back to pre-Covid levels in terms of screen launches. We are seeing a lot of interest from our developer partners for new properties as well as renewed interest in the completion of existing ones,” Devang Sampat, CEO, Cinepolis India, told Moneycontrol. He said that the company is planning to add 60 screens in FY23, with an average investment of approximately Rs 3 crore a screen. Cinepolis India has around 417 screens. “We will be opening more than double the number of screens compared to our five-year average, with higher overall investment,” he noted. Sampat added that in 2018 and 2019, Cinepolis added about 21 screens annually. PVR, which has a total of 854 screens, plans to add 120-125 screens in FY23, up from 75-100 screens in pre-Covid times. It aims to have a count of 1,000 screens by the first quarter of FY24. “A lot of the development got stuck due to lockdowns and Covid, and malls were not ready but now the malls are ready and therefore, we are taking handover and starting work on them,” said Sanjeev Kumar, Joint MD, PVR, during a Q4 FY22 earnings call. PVR has a capital expenditure (capex) outlook of Rs 350-400 crore for screen fit-outs (interior work) and maintenance spends on existing screens. INOX Leisure plans to open 77 screens in FY23. The company increased its capacity by 85 screens in FY19-2020. In FY22, the multiplex operator had added 32 screens, while PVR had launched 29 screens. Also, PVR and INOX that recently announced merger have plans to add 200 screens every year as a combined entity. Miraj Cinemas' MD Amit Sharma said because of the pandemic many screens that were signed pre-Covid had been kept on hold. But now the company has taken 45 screens for fit-outs and will take another 30 or more screens for fit-outs in the July-September period. “We intend to open 75 screens in FY23. Pre-pandemic, we were doing 35 screens on an average,” he said. “We can do an average of over 50 screens from FY24 onwards. In terms of capex, we will invest Rs 150-170 crore, up from Rs 70-75 crore pre-pandemic,” added Sharma. Even for Carnival Cinemas, Covid-19 played a spoilsport in terms of screen launches. “With the pandemic coming, we had to completely shut down because we are a debt-raised company. Since we were on the brink of (getting) private equity, which did not happen, our biggest challenge post-Covid was opening our entire portfolio of 408 screens. It was not easy in the absence of debt and the time private equity takes to come in,” said Vishal Sawhney, CEO of Carnival Cinemas. He pointed out that pre-Covid the multiplex chain had a run rate of 80-100 screens a year, out of which 60-70 percent were organic screen additions while the rest were acquired screens. ""Now, we are up and running with 70 percent of our existing screens and over the next 60 days, we should be able to open up all our screens. Then we have 118 screens in which we have partly invested and are already part of our portfolio. This will take our total to around 518 screens,” said Sawhney. “We see close to 40-45 screens more, which are our own screens. We have a realty division under which we build malls and every mall has three-four screens.”"

10,Tesla Is Hedging Its Global EV Supply Chain Bets on Indonesia and India,companies," Bloomberg From India to Indonesia, Elon Musk is scouting out sites to make more Teslas for global roads. With the world mired in supply chain chaos, access to materials matters most. He’s got it right.After lobbying against India’s tight policies around manufacturing and prohibitive import duties, Musk is headed to meet Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo and visit several areas across the country, which is also the top producer of nickel, a key metal for batteries. That’s an astute bet — for Tesla and Indonesia. And a missed opportunity for New Delhi. To meet ambitious electric vehicle targets, Indonesia has drawn in several battery and car manufacturers in recent months with a variety of incentives. Government ministers say they hope to have investment across the supply chain. With a friendly policy bolstering the country’s EV goals, manufacturers have started committing billions of dollars. LG Energy Solution, along with other companies, is investing about $9 billion to set up a supply chain — from mining to manufacturing — in the country. Together with Hyundai Motor Co., the firm is developing a battery plant, too. Meanwhile, the world’s largest powerpack maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. is investing almost $6 billion in a battery project with state-backed PT Aneka Tambang Tbk and PT Industri Baterai Indonesia. Further up the value chain, China’s Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co. and PT Vale Indonesia Tbk announced last month they would work together on the former’s fifth nickel project in the country. The move by companies across the EV supply chain into the Southeast Asia’s largest economy shows how important it is to be close to the source of raw materials that feed into manufacturing. If there’s one thing the past year of logistical screw-ups and delays has shown the industry, it’s that proximity is key. Even if global supply and demand is balanced on paper, moving industrial goods around has become expensive, slow and cumbersome. Tesla knows this well. It has created large manufacturing hubs in China and now Germany — countries known for their prowess in industrial production and policies that will help sell its cars. After having trouble making EVs in the US, its market share has grown globally. Now the company is looking to secure materials and make its own batteries, while stopping short of buying mines and getting into a new business. Wherever Musk sees problems in the production process, he looks for a solution. Tesla is essentially creating discrete supply chains across the globe. Automakers wouldn’t have necessarily made their way to Indonesia. The country churns out around 1 million cars in a good year, and is dominated by Japanese producers’ smaller vehicles. The auto market pales in comparison to the likes of China and the US, and EVs make up a small portion. In addition, its geography doesn’t make it an ideal place for electric vehicle charging stations and infrastructure connectivity, although the government aims to make the capital, Jakarta, and the tourist hub of Bali model centers for greener transport. Potential sales generated in Indonesia wouldn’t really move the needle for Tesla. Yet, the country is leveraging existing resources, an EV business-friendly policy and the right story to make it fertile ground for large-scale investment. The moment that happens, Indonesia will be able to boast about its battery manufacturing supply chain on the global scale — a much vaunted accolade these days that even the US is vying for. Private investment into manufacturing batteries will only draw more attention. Meanwhile, India continues to hem and haw around whether it will lift duties. Government officials there have made big, bold statements about their ambitions, talking up their desire to draw in Tesla. Earlier this month, Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari went as far as to say that Tesla would benefit from manufacturing in India. Yet customers who placed orders are still waiting and it’s unclear how Musk’s firm would get a leg up. Now, there are questions around whether Tesla will make its way into India at all, given all the roadblocks. That probably is a good bet, too. Setting up manufacturing now, especially as companies struggle to procure parts for their products and deal with logistical issues and high shipping costs, is the one thing firms don’t want to face. Progress toward EVs has been scattered and commitment isn’t clear. Toyota Motor Corp., one of the world’s biggest automakers but a laggard in EVs globally, has pledged to invest $624 million to making EV-related components through its existing units in India, however it’s unclear who they will buy them. Even India’s dominant automakers Maruti Suzuki India Ltd isn’t planning on EVs until 2025. Add in policy hoops and punitive taxes, and India has all but ruled itself out by making the cost of investing in its market so high. India’s vaccine king, Adar Poonawalla, also decided to weigh in earlier this month. He tweeted that putting capital into making cars in India would be the “best investment” Musk would “ever make.” That’s perhaps too optimistic. EV and battery manufacturers are in high demand across the globe and it will take far more than bold words and political ambition — that includes making existing resources available and coming up with a coherent policy that manufacturers can work with. It’s bizzare, then, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government continues to hold back. Yes, there are a few domestic EV models however, the Indian auto market remains an aspirational one. That means wide-scale adoption will pick up pace where there are models that people want to buy — like Tesla’s Model 3 — or enough charging facilities that make it easy, as the evolution of the two-wheeler market showed.

13,Zydus Lifesciences launches drug for treating bad cholesterol,companies," Zydus Lifesciences on Friday said it has launched in India its Bempedoic acid drug under the Bemdac brand for treatment of uncontrolled levels of bad cholesterol. Bemdac (Bempedoic acid) is a new class of drug which is orally administered and offers a new line of treatment for patients suffering from uncontrolled levels of LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-c) despite lifestyle modifications and the use of maximum tolerated dose of statins, which form the cornerstone of dyslipidemia management, the company said in a regulatory filing. ""With Bemdac we are happy to introduce a first-in-India therapy to address the unmet medical need of people suffering from uncontrolled LDL-c,"" Zydus Lifesciences Managing Director Sharvil Patel said. Stating that Bemdac is an important addition to Zydus' portfolio of medicines for managing dyslipidemia and cholesterol, Patel said the mission is to empower patients with a better quality of life through effective disease management and with Bemdac the company has taken a great leap ahead in this endeavour. The company said LDL-c is often referred to as bad cholesterol since it gets deposited in the walls of the blood vessels, increasing the chances of health problems like heart attack or stroke. Uncontrolled LDL-c is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases. Citing various studies, Zydus said, 8 out of 10 Indians are dyslipidemic1 and 112 million adults suffer from high levels of LDL-c; 7 out of 10 dyslipidemia patients who are on statin treatment continue to suffer from uncontrolled LDL-c.

18,From salary hike to hot jobs: 4 takeaways from Teamlease Salary Primer Report,companies," Salary hikes will be secular across sectors and the median increment for FY22 is likely to be around 8.13 percent, the Jobs and Salary Primer Report for FY2022 by TeamLease Services said on May 12. But sectors like e-commerce and tech start-ups, healthcare and allied industries, IT and knowledge services are set to witness double-digit salary growth, the staffing firm said in its annual survey. Across sectors, salaries grew or are set to grow by a minimum of 4.11 percent and a maximum of 10.71 percent in FY22. This was ranged between 3.08 percent and 10.33 percent in FY21. Here are four takeaways from the report: Demand for specialised skills Employers continue to place a premium on super-specialised job roles and the demand for this job category continues to rise. Growth rates in the category have inched up from 11 percent to 12 percent this year. TeamLease that collected jobs and pay-out trends from 263,000 temporary profiles, 17 industries and nine cities, said e-commerce and tech start-ups, healthcare and allied industries, IT and knowledge services exhibited growth in excess of 11 percent. Besides, agriculture and agrochemicals, banking, financial services and insurance, BPO and IT-enabled services, construction and real estate, educational services, media, and industrial manufacturing have exhibited less than 10 percent growth. Top profiles As per the staffing and human resources firm, finance consultant (agriculture and agrochemicals), credit financial analyst (BFSI), business operations analyst (e-commerce and tech start-ups), QS and planning engineer (FMCD), automation engineer (IT and knowledge services) are among the top profiles that are witnessing strong demand in the market. “A majority of these job roles are now COVID-proof… and salary growth is more or less uniformly distributed across this large majority, with most organisations adapting to multiple modes of work -- office, remote and hybrid, and normalcy returning to the workplace,” the survey added. COVID-slump bottoms out The year marks a clear departure from the pandemic-imposed slump experienced by all sectors, without exception. More sectors (10) are accelerating towards pre-COVID levels than the ones that are steadily getting there. Agriculture and agrochemicals, automobile and allied industries, BFSI, e-commerce and tech start-ups, educational, pharma, retail and telecommunications have shown quick progress towards pre-COVID levels. Similarly, sectors like BPO & ITeS, construction, real estate, FMCD, hospitality, industrial manufacturing, and media and entertainment are making steady progress towards a pre-COVID situation. Work from home or work from office? Sectors with significant work-from-home (WFH) profiles will benefit on account of business continuity. Sectors like BPO & ITeS, e-commerce, & tech start-ups, educational services, IT and knowledge services will benefit the most from WFH continuity. In contrast, sectors like agriculture, agrochemicals, automobile, banking and financials, pharma, retail, entertainment, and industrial manufacturing are unlikely to benefit much from WFH continuity.

19,Tata Sons picks new CEO to helm Air India after İlker Ayci setback,companies," Tata Sons named Campbell WIlson as chief executive officer and managing director of Air India on May 12 – an appointment that had been eagerly anticipated since the previous designate for the top job stepped back before even taking the reins. İlker Aycı had said he did not want the job, citing negative press coverage. Ayci had been in the dock for his association with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has taken a stand against India’s interests in the past few years. Wilson will confront a host of challenges, but he brings along experience that is valuable and could help solve a complex puzzle the Tata group inherited -- the challenge of operating two airlines (Air India and Air India Express), looking at the merger of AirAsia India and integrating it with the group and fitting Vistara into the mix. Working with Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group since 1996 with exposure to markets in New Zealand, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Wilson has experience in sales, marketing, revenue and network planning. Rarely do airline groups groom and rotate people in such a manner that they get holistic exposure as the SIA Group does. Experience in integration Wilson was the founder-CEO of Scoot - the low-cost arm of SIA group, which was formed in November 2011 and started operations in June 2012. The airline started collaborating with TigerAir -- another entity that received investment from SIA. The last couple of years have seen the SIA Group evolve in multiple ways. This includes cross-selling inventory of its Low-Cost Carrier (LCC) and Full-Service Carrier (FSC) arms. This included earning miles, through check-in and everything needed for a single-priced ticket. While AirIndia Express has been in existence for 17 years, Air India has not been able to implement this - thus not being able to make the most of the vast and unique network. Integration of manpower, systems and reporting structure are the major challenges -- which Wilson has seen and dealt with first hand in his various roles. He relinquished the position of CEO at Scoot Air in May 2016, only to return to the SIA Group as SVP for marketing and sales with Singapore Airlines – a post he held until March 2020. As COVID-19 struck, he took over reins of Scoot for the second time and has been its CEO until his appointment with Air India. Fleet In its early days, Scoot operated a mix of B787s and B777-200. This was followed by some standardisation based on route and fleet evaluation. But as the merger with TigerAir went through, the airline again ended up with a mix of narrow-body and wide- body planes. Wilson held senior positions in the SIA group when the group decided to move from four airlines to two, merging Silk Air with Singapore Airlines and TigerAir with Scoot, making for a low-cost arm and a full-service arm. Air India group is facing a similar problem with exactly the same number of airlines - four! This experience will come in handy as Air India looks at fleet renewal - which will involve a decision on wide- body aircraft as well as renewal of fleet on the narrow-body side. Like SIA Group, Air India too comes with a medley of aircraft types including a mix of Airbus and Boeing planes. The Vistara question Vistara was the second airline which the Tata group started, in partnership with Singapore Airlines. The Tata group has a 51% share in the airline. Every CEO since inception has been a former Singapore Airlines associate on deputation to the airline. Sooner or later, the question of two full-service carriers -- often eating into each other's market -- would start troubling the Tata group, if it already isn't. Wilson’s close association with SIA Group could help work towards an integration of the airline into the Air India fold or work at ways to operate separately without eating into each other’s market. Tail Note Did the top management at Tata Sons consult partners at Singapore Airlines on the CEO’s post? After the initial fiasco, this cannot be ruled out. The Tatas have time and again shown that they value partnerships, so much so that they continue to fund AirAsia India even when the foreign partner, AirAsia Bhd, couldn’t chip in. This was later converted to equity. The experience which Wilson brings to Air India looks to be more relevant than what Ayci could have brought to the table and the added advantage of his coming from a partner airline would make things simpler.

The company also announced the appointment of Samson Samuel as the new CEO of the company, effective from May 12. Ashni Biyani  resigned “...as managing director of the company with effect from closure of business hours on 12th May, 2022.

Ashni Biyani’s resignation comes close on the heels of Rakesh Biyani’s departure from Future Retail as its managing director. Rakesh Biyani is a cousin of Kishore Biyani. Future Consumer is a subsidiary of Future Group, which has been embroiled in legal battles with Amazon over the sale of Future Retail to Reliance Industries. In a setback to the Future Group last month, Reliance called off its takeover of Future Retail. Even as Amazon and Future Retail are engaged in litigations, the lenders have started insolvency proceedings against the latter. Of late, reports have surfaced that Kishore Biyani plans to sell key assets and restructure debt to pay off his debts as Future Retail faces bankruptcy proceedings. Future Consumer, the FMCG arm of Future Group, houses brands such as Golden Harvest, Tasty Treat, CleanMate, Kara etc. The new CEO of the company, Samson Samuel, said he is ""well aware of challenges ahead to restore profitable growth & alleviate debt by selling certain non-strategic assets,"" according to the filing. Samson Samuel, is an engineer with around 24 years of experience spanning across manufacturing, consulting, IT and supply chain industries.

21,AC makers set for 25-30% growth over pre-COVID times as India swelters in extreme heatwave,companies," Air conditioner manufacturers are set for a bumper season after two years and have reported record sales in March and April as large parts of India swelter in an extreme heatwave. Higher sales come even as AC makers battle supply-chain constraints because of lockdowns in China, a supplier of several key components to the industry. “We have seen an unprecedented summer this year. The kind of heat we would typically see in April, we witnessed in March this year,” said Eric Braganza, president of the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA). “As a result, we have seen a big boost in AC sales. And sales in January-June this year will be a big jump over the last year,” Braganza added. The industry recorded sales of 1.75 million units in April, double the sales in the same month last year, said CEAMA. According to Braganza, the industry is set to witness 50-60 percent growth over last year and an increase of about 25-30 percent over the pre-COVID period. “We had lost the last peak seasons because of the COVID-19 pandemic but we don’t expect any disruptions this time around,” he added. Warmest April in 122 years Several parts of India have wilted in extreme temperatures, with last month being the warmest April on record in 122 years. The India Meteorological Department has warned of more such spells during the rest of the summer. AC manufacturers such as Havells India, Voltas and Godrej Appliances have reported record sales in recent months. Havells, for instance, sold 250,000 units in April, its highest-ever in a month. “There is a lot of pent-up demand because of COVID-related mobility restrictions not only from consumers but even on the B2B (business-to-business) side as schools and offices were not open for the last seasons but are resuming operations now,” said Alok Tickoo, executive vice president of Havells-owned Lloyd. Likewise, Voltas has recorded high sales this season. According to a Voltas spokesperson, sales have grown and almost touched the same volume as in April 2019, which recorded the hottest summer of the decade. Component shortages bite The industry is at the same time grappling with a shortage in the supply of several key components such as semiconductors, controllers and compressors due to COVID-related lockdowns in China. “Given the component ecosystem’s dependence on China, the supply chain is under pressure. We are witnessing a short supply scenario in some components, and the situation could worsen if the lockdown continues into June. It could take a quarter or more for the situation to normalize once China lifts its lockdown restrictions,” said Kamal Nandi, business head and executive vice president at Godrej Appliances, a part of Godrej & Boyce. Godrej Appliances has reported a 20 percent jump in sales this year so far compared to 2019. The shortage of components has impacted the supply of energy-efficient air conditioners or the ‘Five Star’ category because there is an acute shortage of controllers and compressors needed for these models. According to Braganza, the shortage of these components had led to a fall in production as manufacturers are unable to find alternative sourcing options in the short term. Price increases The shortage of products and supply-chain constraints have also led to price hikes. Manufacturers across the segment have raised prices by around 10-12 percent since January as they battle inflationary pressures, according to CEAMA. Price hikes and the absence of a few models from the stores, however, has not deterred consumers from buying ACs, report retailers such as Vijay Sales. “A few models by certain brands are in shortage but given the heat, consumers do not care about models and are open to buying alternatives,” said Nilesh Gupta, director of Vijay Sales. The consumer is not too fazed by the price rise either. “About 70 percent of consumers buying through us anyway avail of the EMI (equated monthly instalment) option so the price rise does not matter much to them,” Gupta added.
