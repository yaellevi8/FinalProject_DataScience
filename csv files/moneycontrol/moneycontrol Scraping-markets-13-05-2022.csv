0,Escorts Q4 Result | Firm's net profit falls 29% YoY to Rs 190 crore,markets," Farm machinery and construction equipment major Escorts Ltd on May 13 reported a 28.5 percent decline in its consolidated net profit at Rs 190 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2022 (Q4FY22). The firm said decline in profit and revenue was due to volume drop in the tractor and construction equipment division. Adverse commodity prices also impacted the financials. Revenue for the quarter fell 16% year-on-year to Rs 1,879 crore. EBITDA margins slumped by 252 basis points (bps) to 13.1% from 15.6% a year ago. Tractor sales were at 21,895 units in the quarter, down 33 percent from a year earlier. Domestic market share of tractors declined by 150 bps to 11.4% from 12.9% last year. Construction equipment sales were at 1,286 units, down 20 percent, the company said. “Agri sector is seeing some positive tailwinds. April industry growth of 41% is a big booster of confidence.

Nanda said construction and railway sectors have also shown signs of improvement. With Government spending focus in these sectors, the situation shall only improve from here.

1,"SBI net profit rises 41% in Q4 to Rs 9,113.5 crore, misses estimate",markets," State Bank of India on May 13 reported a 41 percent year-on-year rise in net profit of Rs 9,113.5 crore for the quarter ended March, which was below Street's estimate of Rs 9,927.6 crore. SBI's net profit for Q4FY22 was its highest ever but it still underwhelmed the street as expectations were on the higher side. The bank's shares slipped a little over 1 percent in response to the quarterly results. The net profit growth was on the back of a 15.3 percent growth in net interest income which stood at Rs 31,198 crore. This too was lower marginally versus analysts' expectations of Rs 31,570 crore. Non-interest income disappointed, slipping 27 percent year-on-year. But on a sequential basis, non-interest income jumped 37 percent while NII growth was a mere 1.6 percent. The lender's operating profit  was flat year-on-year and showed a modest growth of 6.4 percent sequentially. This could be attributed to an increase in operating costs for the bank. The lender expects to reduce some of its costs in the coming quarter, chairman Dinesh Khara said in a press meet post the release of the results. Notwithstanding the modest operating metrics, the bank's loan book grew at a decent 11 percent. Khara said that the loan book growth is broad based with both retail and corporate showing strong growth. ""We should continue to see the loan growth we have seen in the past both in retail and corporate,"" he said. SBI's retail loan book growth continued to outpace that of its corporate loan book. Retail loans showed a growth of 15. 11 percent, driven by home loans while corporate loans showed a growth of 6.3 percent from a year ago period. Khara said that credit growth would continue to improve going forward and that the bank was seeing demand from various sectors. He added that SBI has unused working capital limit of Rs 2 lakh crore which he expects to be used fully as Indian companies begin to increase their investments and capacity utilisation improves. Asset quality Even as the bank reported an improvement in loan growth, SBI's strong point was its asset quality in Q4FY22. The lender continued to see sequential improvement in asset quality as gross non-performing assets ratio declined to 3.97 percent from 4.5 percent in the previous quarter. Similarly, the bank's net NPA ratio fell to 1.02 percent in the reported quarter from 1.34 percent in the previous quarter. What's more is that fresh slippages were just Rs 2845 crore for the quarter, down by 12.4 percent from a year ago period. The bank had guided for slippage ratio to be brought down to 2 percent and Khara indicated that this would be achieved easily. When asked about the bank's exposure to troubled accounts such as Future Group, Khara said that all stressed exposures have been adequately provided for. He refrained from detailing the extent of SBI's exposure to troubled accounts. SBI's restructured loan accounts were roughly Rs 30,000 crores or 1.1 percent of its total loan book.  The book is fully provided for, the bank said. Given the reduced stress, the bank's provisions for the quarter fell 67 percent year-on-year, another boost for profits.

2,"D-Street Buzz: Nifty auto shines; Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, M&M jump 4-10%",markets," The Indian stock market recovered smartly on May 13 after taking a huge beating the previous day, with the Sensex up 687.28 points, or 1.3 percent, at 53,617.59, and the Nifty jumping 224.40 points, or 1.42 percent, at 16,032.40 in the afternoon trade. Among sectors, the auto index jumped 4 percent led by Tata Motors, which surged more than 10 percent, a day after it shared its March quarter earnings. Tata Motors reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 1,032 crore for the quarter ended March, down from a net loss of Rs 7,605 crore in the year-ago quarter. The company reported an 11.5 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated revenue from operations to Rs 78,439 crore for the reported quarter. Broking house CLSA has upgraded the rating of Tata Motors to underperform from sell and also raised the target price to Rs 411 from Rs 392 a share. Its domestic business was strong, while JLR challenges continued and disappointed due to negative surprise on ASP. The volumes, mix and higher realisation led to margin recovery in commercial and passenger vehicles, while strong demand should lead to volume growth. JP Morgan has an “overweight” rating on the stock and raised the target to Rs 525. There was a strong FCF recovery and solid guidance for FY23 and it expects the the company to continue on its deleveraging journey. The company should forecast net automotive debt to decline to Rs 11,800 crore by FY24, CNBC-TV18 reported the brokerage as saying. Catch all the market action on our live blog Morgan Stanley also has an “overweight” rating, with the target price at Rs 560. JLR is set to have a weak Q1 but FY23 guidance is a positive surprise. Unlike the 2018 down cycle, the company is now better placed on JLR, as well as India PVs & CVs. JLR guided facing headwinds, Q1 EBIT margin and FCF may be negative. The other top performers in the auto index were Bharat Forge and Ashok Leyland, which gained 6 percent each, followed by TVS Motor, Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors and Hero MotoCorp. The most active auto stock in terms of volumes were Tata Motors where 4,41,88,732 shares were changing hands at 12.29 pm followed by Ashok Leyland (1,45,86,135). The recovery in the auto sector was aided by the rise in April auto sales. Tata Motors' sales in April jumped by over a two-third from the year-ago period, whereas rivals Hyundai India and Maruti Suzuki faced a decline. Maruti Suzuki's April cumulative sales declined 5.7 percent, as the company sold 1.50 lakh units as compared 1.59 lakh cars in the year-ago period. According to Amit Joshi, Chief Investment Officer at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, the auto sector is a interest-rate sensitive sector as financing cost plays a critical role in purchasing decision. But overall the demand is more a function of growth and less of interest rates. The sector is coming out of a down cycle and we are still early in the upcycle, he said.

3,"India is an oasis in the desert, says Nilesh Shah of Kotak AMC",markets," India has emerged as an oasis in the desert when one looks at what is happening in our neighbourhood and globally, Nilesh Shah, managing director at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company told CNBC-TV18 in an interview on May 13. The veteran asset manager, however, acknowledged that domestic market conditions will be driven by what is happening in Eastern Europe given that the pendulum can swing either side in the Russia-Ukraine war. “It is far better to remain humble, look at events as they are unfolding and then build your portfolio,” Shah said. Shah said that valuations have largely become reasonable because of the ongoing correction in the stock market. Domestic benchmark indices have fallen more than 14 percent from their record highs hit in October 2021 due to fears of aggressive interest rate hikes, Russia-Ukraine war and surging global crude oil prices. “We think this is time to invest in sectors where valuations are reasonable,” Shah said. The asset manager also said that in the current inflationary environment his fund house is investing in companies that have pricing power. “We want to invest in companies that can push the higher prices to consumers without losing volumes,” Shah added. Shah said that across equity funds, one-year returns for systematic investment plans have turned negative or are just mildly positive, which has had a bearing on sentiment. That said, Shah said that investors are still looking to use the correction to buy in the market.

4,"State Bank of India Q4 Results Preview | Profit may surge 50% on healthy loan growth, asset quality",markets," State Bank of India (SBI) is likely to report strong performance for the quarter ended March 2022 when it will declare its results on May 11. Experts expect India’s largest banker to report a robust on-year growth of 50 percent for the quarter and expect its net interest income (NII) to increase 16 percent over the same period last year. According to a poll of four brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol, SBI is likely to post a net profit of Rs 10,075 crore for the quarter ended March 2022 on a NII of Rs 31,360 crore. The bank had registered a PAT of Rs 6,451 crore during the corresponding period last year with NII coming in at Rs 27,067 crore. The profit during the October – December period stood at Rs 8,432 crore when the bank had registered a NII of Rs 30,687 crore. The growth is likely to be driven by healthy traction in loan growth on a sequential basis backed by modest credit costs and steady asset quality. “Credit growth is likely to gather pace (up 4 percent QoQ / 9 percent YoY) led by sequential uptick in retail, corporate and overseas advances,” a report from ICICI Securities said. Operating profit growth is likely to be 8-14 percent on-year due to lower growth in operating expenses. “NIM (net interest margin) will be stable at 3.2 percent QoQ; treasury income will be lower and there are no one-offs in the wage costs for the quarter,” a report from Kotak Institutional Equities said. Experts expect slippages at 2 percent of loans (Rs 13,500 crore) mostly driven by SME and retail, while corporate continues to hold up relatively well. The trends on recovery and upgradation are expected to be better during the quarter. Gross NPA (non-performing assets) for the quarter are set to witness a decline of 80 bps year on year and a sequential decline of 30 bps. Net NPAs for the quarter are expected at 1.2 percent compared to 1.5 percent during the last year period and 1.3 percent during the previous quarter of current fiscal. “Specific provision coverage of 71.2 percent (vs 70 percent QoQ), COVID provisions at 24 bps (Rs 6,180 crore), standard assets provisions of Rs 18,300 crore (71 bps) and other provisions of Rs 5,500 crore (~21 bps of advances) suggest adequacy of provisioning”, a report from ICICI Securities said. Rise in bond yields will weigh on treasury gain and there would be mark-down of its non-HTM (held to maturity) portfolio.

5,Boom in equity trading drives 45% jump in NSE’s FY22 profit,markets," The surge in domestic equity market and equity trading in India drove a 45.4 percent on-year rise in National Stock Exchange (NSE)’s consolidated net profit to Rs 5,198 crore in the financial year ended March 31, 2022. NSE, India’s largest stock exchange, saw a 53 percent growth in consolidated revenues in the financial year to Rs 9,500 crore largely led by transaction charges. Trading charges during the period jumped 64 percent on-year to Rs 6,965 crore while the colocation charges rose 58 percent to Rs 433 crore. The stock exchange was helped by the influx of new retail investors over the 12-month period and a strong equity market. Over 40 million new dematerialized accounts were opened with depositories during the previous financial year reflecting strong growth in equity participation. Domestic benchmark indices also reported strong growth during the period as the Nifty 50 and BSE-Sensex rose around 19 percent each. Also Read | Chitra Ramakrishna, Anand Subramanian's bail pleas rejected NSE, in an investor presentation, said that cash market segment volumes grew 8 percent in 2021-22 while equity options volumes in terms of premium value jumped 114 percent. That said, the stock exchange’s market share in the cash segment declined 100 basis points to 93 percent while derivatives market share remained at 100 percent. Operating performance of the stock exchange was also strong during the financial year as consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose by 54.6 percent to Rs 7,251 crore.

6,Tech Mahindra Q4 Preview | Profit may grow 30% and revenue 24%,markets," Tech Mahindra Ltd, one of India’s top-tier IT services company, is likely to report an on-year growth of 30 percent in consolidated profit after tax (PAT) when it declares its March 2022 quarter results later on May 13. The company’s consolidated revenue is likely to see a jump of 24 percent for the quarter from the year-ago period. Experts have pegged the PAT for the quarter at around Rs 1,410 crore on revenue of Rs 12,050 crore. The company recorded a consolidated profit of Rs 1,081 crore during the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year when it achieved revenues of Rs 9,730 crore. Profit during the previous quarter came in at Rs 1,369 crore and the revenue was at Rs 11,451 crore. “We forecast sequential revenue growth of 5.1 percent in c/c driven by 2.6 percent growth on an organic basis and 2.5 percent contribution from CTC, Allyis, Activus and Lodestone acquisitions,” a Kotak Institutional Equities report said. The brokerage expects growth to be spread across telecom as well the enterprise segment. Comviva, the telecommunication vertical, will also contribute to growth due to seasonal strength, though it will not be as pronounced as in the earlier years. Experts expect the rise in employee and travel costs to have an impact on the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin, which is likely to shrink 235 basis points (bps) on-year and by around 35 bps on quarter to 17.6 percent. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. EBIT margins are likely to decline as attrition and proactive alignment of compensations would hurt overall numbers. “EBIT margins are expected to decline at -50 bps QoQ due to high SG&A (selling, general & administrative) expenses,” a report from the brokerage firm Phillip Capital said. The brokerages expect $ 600-800 million of net new deal wins, a decline on a yearly basis and a growth on a sequential basis. Attrition is likely to remain elevated and the focus will be on attrition at senior and mid-senior levels, as the company is inconsistent in wage revision compared to its peers. Investors and experts will focus on the FY23 outlook. Research firm Emkay Research expects the company to guide for double-digit revenue growth with 18-20 percent EBIT margins. Other monitorbales include CY22 IT budget, deal wins, deal pipeline and pace of deal closures, the growth outlook for ER&D and the products business, the demand outlook for major verticals like BFSI, manufacturing, and healthcare, pricing environment, and attrition. Update on the mergers and acquisition strategy and understanding the integration risks of new acquisitions will be watched as well.

Foreign investors have sold nearly Rs 3 lakh crore since October 2021 in Indian markets. A large part of the selling has been absorbed by the increased participation of retail investors.

9,What Samir Arora is buying and selling as he sees more market pain ahead,markets," Samir Arora, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Helios Capital, sees scope for a further 10 percent correction in the market and expects the domestic market to bottom out when the US markets do the same. In a chat with Moneycontrol, the veteran asset manager dismissed concerns that the current drawdown in the equity market is similar to the 2008 global financial crisis. Domestic benchmark equity indices have twice fallen nearly 15 percent since hitting their record highs in October 2021, with the Nifty smallcap 100 and Nifty midcap 100 indices entering a technical bear market. The sell-off over the past six months has been led by foreign portfolio investors, who have withdrawn more than Rs 2 lakh crore from local stocks over the past seven months as interest rates have gone up in the US and the Russia-Ukraine crisis continues to worsen. “It’s going to be a normal bear market but the trend of Indian public being a counter-force is unlikely to break (anytime soon),” Arora told Moneycontrol. He expects the US equity market, which has led the downturn in global stocks, to settle down in the next three months, as it would have a clearer picture of the quantum of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and its impact on economic growth. In terms of portfolio strategy, Arora said that his firm “plays the odd” and the “odd is against high valuation” companies in the market. “We’ve sold high price-to-earnings (PE) IT companies,” Arora said. The asset manager has shorted commodity-consuming companies in December in anticipation of compression in their margins due to higher commodity prices. Surprisingly, despite Arora’s optimism for domestic investors continuing to plough savings into the equity market, he cut exposure to market-oriented financial services and asset management companies. Arora said his fund has been buying quick-service restaurant companies, hotels and Amber Enterprises recently in a nod to likely recovery in the contact-intensive segment of the economy, as the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic abates. Arora said that state-owned companies outperforming their “labels” were also on his buying list in the current market. “Buy the dip when you know business will be okay over three years. Companies have a sweet spot of three-four years for outperformance,” Arora added. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "

11,"Gold Prices Today: Yellow metal to slide further, experts suggest to sell on rise",markets," Gold prices on Friday in the international markets were held near a three-month low as the strongest dollar in two decades continued to sap demand for greenback-priced bullion, setting up what could be the metal's fourth consecutive weekly fall. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,820.54 per ounce, as of 0054 GMT, having dropped to its lowest since February 7 earlier in the session. US gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,821.20. At 9:28 am, gold contracts were down 0.11 percent at Rs 50,117 for 10 gram on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), while silver added 0.13 percent at Rs 58,830 a kilogram. Fear of rapid rate hikes drove selling pressure in precious metals in the previous trading session, as US inflation figures remained above 40-year high. Yesterday, the US dollar, which normally swings against gold prices, gained 0.90 percent. Due to demand concerns, selling pressure on crude oil and industrial metals has drawn investors to the US dollar index. Technically, gold prices are likely to continue lower in today's session, and any price climb into resistance levels could be a selling opportunity. Gold faces resistance at Rs 50700 and support at Rs 50000, with a drop to Rs 49500 levels possible. Silver has Rs 58000 as support and Rs 60500 as resistance, said Nirpendra Yadav, Senior Commodity Research Analyst at Swastika Investmart. Track Live Gold Prices Here Trading Strategy  Pritam Patnaik, Head - Commodities, HNI & NRI Acquisitions, Axis Securities Gold prices yesterday slid close to $48 from their highs of $1858 to $ 1810, then finically settling around $1821-22. This can be directly attributed to the dollar index hitting its 20-year high of 104.95 yesterday. Gold is clearly losing its safe-haven store value to a surging USD. Ideally, a recessionary economic trend, ratcheting up of the geopolitical situation in the Russian - Ukrainian war, with Russia warning of more destructive measures for aspirant NATO members, Finland and Sweden, and a softer bond markets, should have greatly helped gold bulls' cause, but the exact reverse has taken place. This could be because the flash correction in the global equity markets has drained liquidity, leading to selling orders across all asset classes. Additionally, the risk premium is fairly entrenched with the USD, putting further pressure on gold prices. We are in for another volatile session, with a negative bias. Tapan Patel, Senior Analyst (Commodities), HDFC Securities Gold prices traded steady on Friday with spot gold prices at COMEX were trading near $1824 per ounce taking breather from previous fall. The yellow metal witnessed sharp decline as investors weighed on record inflation assuming aggressive rste hike from FED in coming months. The dollar index hovered near 104.72 while US 10-year bond yields rose by more than 2% lowering demand for gold. We expect gold prices to trade sideways to down for the day with COMEX Spot gold support at $1800 and resistance at $1840 per ounce. MCX Gold June support lies at Rs 49800 per 10 gram and resistance at Rs 50600 per 10 gram. Manoj Kumar Jain, Prithvi Finmart Commodity Research Gold and silver prices were badly hammered after the dollar index hit fresh 20-year high. Both the precious metals settled on a weaker note in the international markets. Gold prices slipped below the crucial support level of $1830 per troy ounce and silver also breaches $21 per troy ounce levels on a daily closing basis. Gold and silver are trading at make or break levels and if the dollar index continues to rise with current pace it could push precious metals lower in the coming sessions. Gold has support at $1814-1800 per troy ounce and resistance at $1838-1850 per troy ounce while silver has support at $20.50-20.20 per troy ounce and resistance at $21.00-21.30 per troy ounce. At MCX, gold has support at Rs 50000-49770 and resistance at Rs 50380-50550 while silver has support at Rs 58300-57500 and resistance at Rs 59220-60000.

13,Indian rupee rebounds from all-time low; rises 19 paise to 77.31/USD,markets," After closing at an all-time low against the US dollar on Thursday, the rupee recovered some lost ground to trade at 77.31 against the US dollar in morning trade on Friday as the American currency retreated from its elevated levels. At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 77.35 against the American dollar, then gained further ground to quote at 77.31, registering a rise of 19 paise from the last close. On Thursday, the rupee plunged 25 paise to close at its lifetime low of 77.50 against the US currency. Forex traders said the Indian Rupee could see range-bound trade against the US dollar as broad dollar strength could offset losses from a rate hike by the Indian central bank next month due to rising domestic inflation. India's headline inflation galloped for a seventh straight month to touch an 8-year high of 7.79 per cent in April on rising food and fuel prices, raising the odds of an interest rate hike by the RBI early next month to tame prices. With factory output measured in terms of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) remaining subdued at 1.9 per cent in March, some economists feel that another interest rate hike on the heels of a 40 basis points increase last week may slow economic growth. ""A likely more hawkish policy shift from the RBI and expectations of RBI intervention will possibly support the rupee this Friday,"" said Sriram Iyer, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities. However, weak Asian and emerging market peers this Friday morning, with the offshore Yuan touching a low of 6.8372 against the dollar will cap appreciation bias. Additionally, crude oil prices continued to strengthen and will cap appreciation bias. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was trading 0.19 per cent lower at 104.65. On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share Sensex was trading 638.13 points or 1.21 per cent higher at 53,568.44, while the broader NSE Nifty advanced 167.70 points or 1.06 per cent to 15,975.70. Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures rose 1.68 per cent to USD 109.25 per barrel. Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Thursday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 5,255.75 crore, as per stock exchange data.

15,"Long story short: More pain ahead in midcaps, smallcaps, says veteran trader Sharad Shah",markets," Sharad Shah is a rare or perhaps near extinct species in the Indian stock market: the permabear. And unlike most traders of his vintage, he makes no bones about his market strategy, short selling stocks. A stock market player for nearly 40 years now, Shah is considered something of a maverick by those who know him. Many of his contemporaries find him too outspoken and even loud, but Shah is not the one to mince words. His trading style, or rather his investment ideology, if one can call it that, has landed Shah in trouble quite a few times in the past. Angry promoters have complained about him to the regulator, to investigative agencies, to the cops. Some threatened him with violence for short selling their stocks, and a few others even made good on their word. Not that it made any difference to Shah’s worldview of the stock market. With shares now in a freefall, Shah feels his theory has been vindicated, and it is payback time. Benchmark indices are down close to 15 percent from their record highs seen in October last year, and Shah feels there is still plenty of room on the downside. He is particularly bearish on midcaps and smallcaps, where he says the pain will be “unbelievable.” Edited excerpts from a freewheeling chat: In your previous interview in August 2020, you said you were extremely bearish on the market, and saw a crash coming. You have been downright wrong, considering where the indices are right now even after the recent correction... Agreed. Because I did not foresee the force of retail liquidity. Never in my career have I seen such high levels of retail participation. I misread the situation. So you must have lost a packet on your trading bets since you are bearish round the year? Yes. I lost some money on my trading bets...till October last year. Things have been better since then. Barring a handful, many stocks have given up a good part of the gains made over the last year. But you would have gained from the appreciation in your investment portfolio? Not a great deal, since my investment portfolio consists mostly of mid and smallcap MNC companies. They did okay, but nowhere close to the massive gains one saw in random stocks during the last couple of years. What is giving you the conviction this time? Prices are way, way ahead of fundamentals… But that has been the case for a while now... …yes, but now you have high inflation, a weak rupee, lackluster earnings, and a massive sell-off in the US market. You can’t have equities quoting at sum-of-the-parts valuations under in such a situation. Can you explain the sum-of-the-parts bit? What I mean to say is that equities are pricing in a blue sky scenario, as if the companies can be sold for such a high price. That does not seem to be the case any longer. How do you say that? Look at the numbers being talked about for Gujarat Ambuja Cement. The stock rallied in anticipation of a sale, but have since given up the gains. This indicates that the market is not confident that the buyer will pay a huge premium. And this is not the only case. But I could well be wrong. In fact, on average I am wrong 87 percent of the time. 87 is a precise number.. do you keep track of your trades? Yes I do, it is important to do that With such a high percentage of wrong calls, how have you managed to survive? By ensuring that the 13 percent right calls more than offset my wrong calls. Whenever I sense I have managed to get my call right, I double down on it. You are known as a permabear in the market. Is that description right? Yes. I have always believed that futures are only for going short. When I am bullish, I would rather buy the stock rather than the futures. Short selling is highly risky. In a raging bull market, you get most of your calls wrong. But having been around for a long time, I feel that shorting is a good strategy. It has been hugely profitable for me over the last decade. Right now the Nasdaq is in a free fall, but technology shares in India are not falling. I don’t see why Indian IT shares should outperform. Look at a stock like Accenture, it is quoting at 22 times forward earnings. And it is one of the best names in the IT services space. For how long can Indian IT names sustain valuations of 30 times plus forward earnings? Which are the stocks you are bearish on? I am short on Infosys, Dixon Technologies, Aarti Industries, Titan, Tech Mahindra and Info Edge. You are up against Rakesh Jhunjhunwala in Titan? He (Jhunjhunwala) is a great man, and I don’t claim that level of greatness. The size of my bet is modest, but I am going to ride it hard. What makes you confident? The company did Rs 500 odd crore of profit in the first quarter. Assuming there is no margin pressure, the company will do Rs 2000 crore for the full year. That kind of earnings is simply not enough to sustain a Rs 1.8 lakh crore market cap in present conditions. I recall you saying that merely a stock being overvalued does not make it a candidate for short selling. True. Bubble valuations can sustain for a long time, but at some point they have to burst. In many stocks, that time appears to be now, looking at the way prices have dropped of late. How do you see the current spell of market correction compared to those in 2008 and 2000? In 2008, we were a much smaller market. Today the market cap is almost 90 percent of the real economy. That is too high. Typically, the market cap should be around 60 percent of the GDP. So there will be a reversion to mean shortly. Also, far too many more players are invested right now, and many are still entering the market. So I fear the implications will be far more severe. People have lost serious money over the last couple of months. In my own circles, I am seeing people suddenly become tight fisted. But isn’t the liquidity situation now different from what it was in 2008? Retail money has cushioned the fall so far and is a far bigger source of liquidity than it was back then. But there is a limit to which retail money can absorb selling by FIIs if they (FIIs) continue to sell at this rate. The last 11 months were an aberration. If prices keep falling, retail investors will soon quit in droves.  At this stage, it almost appears as though local mutual funds are trying to fight the market. But they (local MFs) don’t have a choice, right? if investors are flocking to them with money. I am not saying it is their fault. How do you see the correction playing out? Bear markets are fast and furious, and they don’t last long. I feel prices could bottom out some time in June or July, but it could be a brutal correction. Not to say that the Indian market does not have potential. There are plenty of companies with sound fundamentals, just that the excesses of the last couple of years in the market need to be purged. Besides IT services, which are other sectors are you bearish on? Metal and banking. What about FMCG companies? They too seem overvalued. They will correct, but not by much. Quality names in the FMCG space will always trade at a premium to the rest of the market. But the pain in midcaps and small caps will be unbelievable. They will take a long time to come anywhere their recent peaks. What is your advice to budding short sellers? There are two ways to short sell. One is buy going short on the futures and then hedging your position by buying calls. This also lowers the margin requirement. The second way to buy puts. And you need to be disciplined. As I rule I square off my positions if prices move against me by 4 percent, and then wait for a fresh opportunity to re-enter. Having traded for so long, I get a sense of when I am going wrong, and then I quickly exit my position. You have had run-ins with promoters in the past? Does that happen even now? No. For two reasons. One, the size of the market itself has become very big and my share of the trade is very small. Two, I consciously try to keep the size of my bets small. If my trade is large, then I become the market, and it becomes easy for my rivals to target me. I used to make that mistake in the past. With age, one tries to avoid needless thrills What else has changed in the market? The promoters have become the biggest operators in town, managing their stocks. And many of them do so through portfolio management services (PMS) schemes. Any closing thoughts?

17,How SUVs are riding the K-shaped path to recovery,markets," Faced with headwinds for several years now, the Indian Auto sector has been stuck in the slow lane. What started off as lower demand and a regulatory burden escalated quickly with the pandemic as supply chain constraints, shortage of semiconductor chips, rallying crude and commodity costs, geopolitical conflicts, and rising interest rates were added to the mix. As per data released by FADA (Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations), automobile sales in April 2022 have come in 6 percent lower than..."

The BSE Sensex fell 276 points to 54,088, while the Nifty50 declined 73 points to 16,167 and formed bearish candle which resembles Hammer kind of pattern on the daily charts.

Stay tuned to Moneycontrol to find out what happens in the currency and equity markets today. We have collated a list of important headlines across news platforms which could impact Indian as well as international markets: US Markets U.S. stocks ended a whipsaw session slightly lower on Thursday, as investors juggled signs of peaking inflation with fears that it could remain elevated, prompting ever more aggressive tightening from the Federal Reserve. All three major U.S. stock indexes seesawed and the S&P 500 came within striking distance of confirming it entered a bear market after swooning from its all-time high reached on Jan. 3. When the dust settled, the S&P and the Dow ended modestly red, but the Nasdaq eked out a modest gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.81 points, or 0.33%, to 31,730.3, the S&P 500 lost 5.1 points, or 0.13%, to 3,930.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.73 points, or 0.06%, to 11,370.96. Asian Markets Asian shares found some footing after a volatile session for U.S. equities, but the dollar remained at 20-year highs and global stocks near 18-month lows on worries about persistently high inflation and tightening central banks. Those worries ultimately overcame hopes on Wall Street that high inflation might be peaking, pushing the S&P 500 close to confirming a bear market on Thursday, at nearly 20% off its January all-time high. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 1.15%, trimming its losses for the week to around 3.5%. Australian shares were up 1.56%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index jumped 2.62%. In China, the blue-chip CSI300 index was up 0.92% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.8%. SGX Nifty Trends on SGX Nifty indicate a positive opening for the broader index in India with a gain of 170 points. The Nifty futures were trading around 15,987 levels on the Singaporean exchange. CPI inflation surges to near 8-year high of 7.79% in April The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) worst fears have been realised after data showed headline retail inflation surged to 7.79 percent in April - the highest since May 2014. At 7.79 percent, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation print for April is 84 basis points higher than the March number of 6.95 percent, data released on May 12 by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation showed. Inflation was expected to rise sharply last month. However, the print for April is higher than the already elevated consensus estimate, with a Moneycontrol poll showing economists saw inflation rising to 7.5 percent. The sharp rise in inflation in April was driven by significant price pressures. As expected, fuel items led the charge, with the index for the 'fuel and light' group of the CPI rising 3.1 percent month-on-month in April, resulting in an inflation rate of 10.8 percent. Industrial growth edges up to 1.9% in March from 1.5% in February India's industrial growth, as per the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), edged up to 1.9 percent in March from 1.5 percent in February, data released on May 12 by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation showed. Industrial growth was not expected to show significant improvement in March after data released on April 29 showed the output of India's eight core sectors increased by 4.3 percent year-on-year in the last month of FY22, down from 6 percent the previous month. MPC's June 6-8 meet 'super live' for rate hike after April inflation shocker: Experts The higher-than-expected retail inflation print for April has sent tongues wagging, with experts seeing the June 6-8 meeting of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as ""super live"" for another repo rate hike. Tata Motors Q4 net loss narrows to Rs 1,032 crore, sales slump 11.5% YoY Tata Motors Limited on May 12 reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 1,032 crore for the quarter ended March as against a consolidated net loss of Rs 7,605 crore in the year-ago quarter. The company reported an 11.5 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated revenue from operations to Rs 78,439 crore for the reported quarter. Analysts had expected the company to report a consolidated net profit of Rs 12.8 crore on revenues of Rs 82,386 crore. The weakness in the performance of the company was largely down to subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover, whose revenues in the reported quarter nosedived 27.1 per cent year-on-year to 4.8 billion pound sterling. L&T Q4 consolidated PAT rises 10% YoY to Rs 3,621 crore, revenue grows 10% India's largest infrastructure company Larsen & Toubro Limited on May 12 reported a 10 percent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 3,621 crore, which was below analysts' expectations. The infrastructure giant's consolidated revenue from operations rose 10 percent on-year to Rs 52,851 crore for the reported quarter, missing analysts' expectations. Gold faces fourth weekly drop as burgeoning dollar drains appeal Gold prices on Friday were held near a three-month low as the strongest dollar in two decades continued to sap demand for greenback-priced bullion, setting up what could be the metal's fourth consecutive weekly fall. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $1,820.54 per ounce, as of 0054 GMT, having dropped to its lowest since Feb. 7 earlier in the session. U.S. gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,821.20. Oil climbs even as weaker demand concerns cap gains Oil prices firmed in early trade on Friday but were headed for their first weekly losses in three weeks as worries about inflation and China's COVID lockdowns slowing global growth outweighed concerns about dwindling fuel supply from Russia. Brent crude futures were up 97 cents, or 0.9%, at $108.42 a barrel at 0008 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed $1.00, or 0.9%, to $107.13 a barrel. Both benchmark contracts were, however, on track to post declines for the week, with Brent set to drop more than 3% and WTI more than 2%.

19,"Daily Voice | Interest rates may go up, but don't expect much change in long-term G-Sec yields, says Rajiv Shastri of NJ Asset Management",markets," Long-term government bonds seem to have surpassed the expected yields on the back of a rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India but Rajiv Shastri, Director and Chief Executive Officer at NJ Asset Management, doesn't see much change from this position. ""While rates may go up some more, we don't expect much change in long term G-Sec yields from this point,"" shares the finance professional seasoned in the mutual fund space for over 25 years at an interaction with Moneycontrol. Shastri was part of the team that set up HDFC Mutual Fund. He believes that higher interest rates will lower demand at a time when input costs are high. ""Lower demand will mean that higher input costs cannot be passed on to consumers which will squeeze corporate earnings,"" says Shastri. Excerpts from the interaction: The market has corrected itself more than 12 percent in little over a month. Do you see more corrections, considering the macro issues? Market uncertainty has increased considerably over the last month or so amid a continuing war in Ukraine. This war has caused further supply disruptions, intensifying inflationary pressures which now threaten to become systemic. Apart from disrupting economic activity because of supply shocks, this also makes the interest rate environment very uncertain. So, while we do not try to forecast market movements, our protocols indicate that some caution is advisable in this current environment. Our current equity allocation of about 50 percent reflects that caution. Do you expect slowdown in domestic inflow if there is further correction and volatility? There have been times when domestic flows have slowed in the past as well, but this is typically a short-lived phenomenon. We must remember that not many investors participate in the equity markets even today and the number is steadily increasing. This increased participation is reflected in the inflows that the market experiences. SIP inflows alone are quite substantial and have been growing steadily. Even with slightly higher interest rates, there are still no viable long-term investment options that are capable of beating inflation in a sustainable manner. So, while there is a possibility that domestic flows may experience some short-term disruption, we don't expect it to persist. Global growth concerns are at the fore now with the UK economy contracting in March. Do you see recession in Europe? Europe is in a uniquely disadvantaged position due to its interlinkages with both Ukraine and Russia. The supply disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine have hurt the European economy the most. These are also causing the highest levels of inflation there, compared to the rest of the world. These stagflationary conditions have no easy policy responses and we believe that both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank will struggle with it for some time. The Eurozone also has the added disadvantage of not having a common fiscal policy for the entire region which can be used to stimulate demand. This deprives them of an economic policy response that is available to the rest of the world. So there is a period of pain that can be expected for the Eurozone which will have some spillover effects on the British Economy as well. Do you expect faster policy tightening by the Fed as well as the RBI in the upcoming policy meetings as inflation fear seems to be far from over? The Fed has indicated a clear path and we doubt that it will deviate much from it. It will increase rates and the debt markets there are just about beginning to price these rate hikes. In India, on the other hand, market yields were already elevated before the rate hikes. And while they have moved up even more in response to the rate hikes, the current long term G-Sec appears to be much higher than warranted from a long-term perspective. So, while rates may go up some more, we don't expect much change in long-term G-Sec yields from this point. Shorter term G-Sec yields and Corporate bond yields are not that well placed and these may rise with higher interest rates. Ironically, the longer end of the yield curve appears to be better placed and a safer bet than the short end of the curve. Do you think the pain of inflation and rate hikes by central banks is yet to be digested by the equity market? It's not just about higher rates but their impact on the economic environment that matters. We believe that higher interest rates will lower demand at a time when input costs are high. Lower demand will mean that higher input costs cannot be passed on to consumers which will squeeze corporate earnings. This can cause some short term distress since earnings growth expectations continue to be elevated.
