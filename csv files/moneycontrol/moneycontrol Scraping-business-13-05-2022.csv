0,"Tech Mahindra clocks best revenue growth in seven years, Gurnani reappointed CEO till December 2023",business," India’s fifth largest software exporter Tech Mahindra posted fourth quarter earnings that came in line with analyst expectations but its margins fell short of estimates, due to higher employee expenses and lower utilisation. It ended fiscal year 2021-22 with a double digit revenue growth of 17.3% and expects the momentum to continue going forward. “We believe this is the best performance in terms of growth we have had in seven years. 17.3% YoY growth reflects our commitment to guidance, employees, and the value that we create for the customers,” said CP Gurnani, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Tech Mahindra said. Its net new TCV (total contract value) for the quarter came in at $1.01 billion, up 44% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), signaling a strong pace of deal making. It also made a couple of management related announcements. While Gurnani’s term has been extended till December 2023, Rohit Anand has been appointed CFO, taking over from Milind Kulkarni. While software firms have seen robust growth in the last fiscal on the back of post-pandemic digitisation and migration to cloud, attrition is a niggling concern, as companies step up hiring of technology talent. For Tech Mahindra, its attrition rate stood at 24 percent, unchanged from the previous quarter. The total headcount stood at 151,173, up 4.2% QoQ, with the company adding 6,106 net employees during the quarter. The company had earlier said it was looking to make 15,000 campus hires in 2022-23, up from 10,000 in the last financial year, to keep pace with rising demand and attrition. “We have invested heavily on people. We have also invested in tier two cities and opened 15 new centers. Our global delivery centers have also gone up to at least four new ones in Latin America and another four in Europe,” Gurnani said. Communication, Media and Entertainment (CME), one of its strongest businesses, grew well thanks to the demand for 5G telecom services. “We have seen large deal wins as clients have started to roll out 5G networks and commercialize them,” Anand said. Tech Mahindra said it won a strategic deal for building & operating Europe’s first fully cloud-native end-to-end 5G network augmenting & operating network data centres, labs & the security infrastructure. Secondly, within the media and entertainment vertical, the company has seen a strong uptake in the Metaverse offerings. “We're looking at that as a big growth opportunity,” Anand said. The BFSI (Banking, financial services and insurance) too posted strong growth, with the vertical crossing a billion dollars in run rate for the first time. “CME was always the Northstar, it is doing very well. But I’m happy that BFSI joined the billion-dollar club,” added Gurnani. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
1,CERT-In to issue clarifications on controversial April 28 directions,business," The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) is set to come out with a clarification on the April 28 directions, with it likely to state that the rules of maintaining customer logs may not apply to enterprise and corporate virtual private networks. The April 28 directions stated that “virtual private server (VPS) providers”, “VPN service providers” will be required to maintain logs including names of customers, their IP addresses etc for a period of 5 years. Since then, this mandate has raised privacy concerns and it has also been criticised by major VPN companies such as NordVPN, Surfshark and others. According to information available with Moneycontrol, the term “VPN service providers” will just apply for entities that provide ‘internet proxy liek services’ through the use of VPN technologies to general Internet subscribers. These recommendations and clarifications have still not been finalised, and are expected to be released in the coming days. The clarifications are also likely to mandate that service providers, data centres and body corporates who do not yet have a physical presence in India will be required to designate a point of contact for liaising with CERT-In. Apart from that, CERT-In is expected to clarify that non-compliance of the April 28 directions which has been issued under Sec 70B of the IT Act 2000 will attract penal provisions of the same Act. The new Indian VPN regulations are an assault on #privacy and threaten to put citizens under a microscope of surveillance. We remain committed to our no-logs policy and recommend everyone using our servers in India to follow these guidelines: https://t.co/85WTkUJ5Z6. (1/2)  Apart from this, the upcoming CERT-In clarifications are also expected to include statements on the distinction between the IT Rules 2021 and the April 28 directions, clarification on reporting cybersecurity incidents and so on. However, it is not just the provisions regarding VPN that had irked different quarters of the industry. Concerns were also raised regarding the direction that all body corporate will have to mandatorily retain logs of their systems for 180 days. Experts had pointed out to Moneycontrol that compliance to this provision may involve additional expenses. The direction that cybersecurity events will have to be reported within six hours was also criticised. For instance, Supratim Chakraborty, partner in Khaitan and Co had questioned whether companies will be equipped to report such cases within the timeframe.

2,"Interview | With eyes on revenue of Rs 2.73 lakh crore by FY26, L&T will execute strategic plan to focus on core, technology and talent: CEO",business," Larsen & Toubro’s (L&T) new five-year strategic plan charts out a path for the company to add over Rs 1 lakh crore in revenue by FY26. SN Subrahmanyan, chief executive officer and managing director of L&T, said that the engineering major, which currently derives most of its revenue from the infrastructure sector, aims to be a technology solution provider of eminence in the near future. In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol’s Rachita Prasad, Subrahmanyan talks about the road ahead, aspirations to be zero debt and a clean energy solutions provider, and how he is incubating startups within one of India’s oldest infrastructure groups. Edited excerpts: Despite the challenges in order inflow that you witnessed in FY22, especially as domestic order inflows declined, you have given a target of 12-15 percent growth in order inflow and revenue. What’s behind this thinking? It’s positive thinking. We’ve done well, we grew our orders by 10 percent, sales by 15 percent and we’ve grown profit by 10 percent. It’s a very good record to have under an excruciatingly tough situation born out by COVID, the European war situation, the commodity price increase, and logistical mismatch that is happening. L&T and the people who work here have been resilient. This gives us a good feeling that L&T-ites are able to outperform even in an extremely tough situation. Therefore, as the situation eases, we can continue on the path as there is momentum now. One of the biggest challenges has been to get people to infrastructure projects sites. At the project sites, unless you do physical work, there is no billing. We normally employ about 65,000 staff and about 290,000 labourers on our project sites. There was difficulty there as two times the labour went away, and we had to bring them back. We normally employ about 65,000 as our staff and about 290,000 contractual workers to do physical labour at our project sites. Due to COVID, on two occasions the contractual workers left for their native places and we had to arrange for their return. That’s not easy. In the last 24 months, we have not worked for eight to nine months because of COVID. Now the momentum is back, people are back to sites. But there’s a worry about commodity prices, for which we’ve taken adequate measures. But beyond that, we’re pushing on all cylinders and there is a possibility that sales, and profit can continue to grow in this environment. At the press conference on May 12, the management said there is significant deferment in orders, and that government orders are not coming in as fast as it used to. What’s your outlook on the order tendering process? The last two years, we had a blockbuster budget from the government. Now the budget has been translated into action. A huge amount of investment has been planned across core sectors like roads, railways, water projects, power transmission and hydrocarbon. We are present in all these areas so it has had a positive effect on us. And that’s why you see the robust order growth. Now what has happened is that when the crude prices suddenly shot up and as India is heavily dependent on crude, some of the money that we have budgeted gets diverted towards crude. Second, inflation is raising the head, not only in India but across the globe, and we need to be careful and watchful about it. Third, there is a very unnatural increase in prices, which is not only due to raw material price increase but also due to excess profit being made by commodity firms. This does impact the infrastructure space. The government’s budgets are made two-three years earlier, and when we bid for them, due to these factors we bid higher. If the bid is 10-15 percent higher in range, the government departments go through the process and bids are approved and orders are placed. But now due to commodity price increase, bid prices are higher by 20 percent or more. In that case, government departments and public sector companies cannot go through with the bidding and need to debate and justify the price rise. So there could be some deferment or shift in projects. That is bound to be a bit irritating, because what should happen in one month will take two months or three months to happen. Your EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin declined in FY22 and, as you mentioned, commodity prices continue to remain high. Given that and your ability to pass on the cost burden to customers, what will the margins be for FY23? The margin depends on many factors, of which two are most important. As a project company, margin is realised only after the project has done 25 percent of its cost. During the COVID period, jobs which ought to be accounted for profit recognition or valuation in the previous year have not come through and have been deferred to this year. Second, due to the commodity price increase, we deliberately defer some projects. About 85 percent of our contracts are covered with price variation/reimbursement or other such clauses. But about 15 percent of the contracts are not covered by this. Today, the inflation is such that even the WPI increase does not reflect the inflation. Inflation is slightly higher than the WPI graph. So we are experiencing some cost pressures within the system. We will have to manage it. We’ll have to do projects faster, take it up with the clients, and hedge materials. One cannot run away from the fact that there is a cost push, that is what has been reflected in the slight decline in margins in FY22. That will continue during the year, but we will manage it. What is the order pipeline for potential projects that you could bid for looking like? What are the sectors that will drive the growth? Being very cautiously optimistic on this, the order prospects that we are looking at is Rs 8 lakh crore to Rs 9 lakh crore, same as last year. We expect momentum to pick up. Key sectors would be water, power transmission, minerals and metals, and hydrocarbon projects. You have finalised the five-year strategic plan Lakshya 26 which aims at increasing revenue to Rs 2.73 lakh crore by FY26 from Rs 1.36 lakh crore in FY21. This plan was deferred due to the pandemic but now that it’s finalised, what is the goal? We are in three broad sectors right now as an organisation, the largest being the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) projects, the second being the hi-tech manufacturing which includes our heavy engineering and defence, and the third is the services sector, which includes L&T Infotech (LTI), Mindtree, L&T Technology Services (LTTS), and also the outlier L&T Financial Services. So when you look to 2026, these are the three sectors that we will be in; all our investments and plans will be centred on this. What are the growth targets for the EPC and heavy engineering space in Lakshya’26? The EPC project business will continue to grow at 11-13 percent. The last two years were impacted by COVID and looking at them does not give the right picture. If you look at the trend overall, it continues to grow at 11-13 percent. The hi-tech manufacturing business will grow at between 12 percent and 15 percent. Our shops are full right now. We continue to expect that these sectors will get sufficient orders with the growth of refinery, petrochemical, green business and such. How will the services business play out during Lakshya’26? The services business, excluding L&T Financial, have been growing upwards of 20-25 percent. We do believe with the merger of LTI and Mindtree, subject to statutory approvals, the combined entity will see robust growth. LTI is very strong in ERP (enterprise resource planning), and Mindtree is very strong in the customer experience space. A combination of these provides a fantastic service input to clients. What would L&T look like after Lakshya’26 ends? As we look into the future, the EPC project business, which is about 70 percent of the company, may come down to about 65 percent and the 5 percent space could get occupied by the IT and technology services business. This means the market cap of L&T, which is now 30 percent by IT and technology services companies, can become 40-45 percent. So we will be more profitable, average weighted average profitability will go up. We will be more of a technology solutions provider company and that is robust and good from an overall point of view. L&T has been increasingly looking at the green energy business. What kind of plans do you have for this space in the strategic plan? L&T is a truly integrated power company—from mining equipment, transportation of coal, making boiler turbines, putting up EPC power plants, running your own power plant, doing power transmission distribution projects, and we were even present in the medium- and low-voltage switchgears business. We have moved away from some of these businesses one by one; we sold off the switchgear business. We don’t find huge traction coming in our boiler and turbine business for coal-fired plants. But we do not want to lose the fact that we’ve been in this business for decades and that is very fundamental to L&T because power is the backbone of the economy. So the logical move is to look at the green power business. We are the largest EPC player in solar, but we don’t want to be invested in solar projects. So we are looking at getting into manufacturing for electrolysers (for green hydrogen), which can be done in our turbine factory. We are in touch with various technology players across the world, with the right technology and the momentum, to make electrolysers. The investment will be in the region of about Rs 1,000 crore for a 500-megawatt electrolyser production capacity, which is more than adequate at the moment. We also tied up with Indian Oil Corporation and ReNew Power for green hydrogen. We also thought that being in the green energy space, we will have to be in the grid battery storage space. At the moment, it’s not viable because the battery costs upwards of $190 per kilowatt hour. It needs to come down drastically for it to be viable as a power source. We are again in touch with some technology players to see how we can jointly do some research and development to bring battery costs down. And if that happens during the latter part of the planned period, it could see some investments in the battery space, but not right now. How are your monetisation plans for Hyderabad Metro coming along? Two factors that were not going well for the project. One, a lot of people were not travelling to office due to COVID. Traffic had gone down very drastically, now it’s sort of coming back. As we speak, it’s about 300,000 people per day. The second issue was the huge debt of nearly Rs 13,000 crore, so there was interest cost. In our profit and loss account, this project was probably the only loss-making business. We cannot move away from this project because it’s a concession agreement; we are there for 65 years. We also have a minimum equity commitment of 26 percent. We appealed to the Telangana government and they have been kind enough to sanction a soft loan of Rs 3,000 crore into the project. That money will come in over a period of time and once it does, it will go towards repayment of debt which will reduce to Rs 10,000 crore. We have a term sheet with an investor, which I cannot reveal right now because a few conditions and precedents are to be overcome, which will happen shortly. And if that happens, another Rs 4,000 crore of equity money will come into the project. With this, we will come down from 100 percent to 51 percent. If the Rs 4,000 crore investment comes in, the debt of Rs 10,000 crore can be reduced to Rs 6,000 crore. We can also monetise some real estate, which we’ll do shortly. That will reduce debt to nearly Rs 4,000-5,000 crore. We have recently restructured the loan and the interest rate has been brought down from 9.7 percent to 6.2 percent. So with this, whatever can be done financially has been done in the project. We just have to hope that people start going back to office and the project will become cash-flow positive and even viable over a period of time. The best that can be done in Hyderabad Metro is to move it away from the balance sheet by doing an InvIT (infrastructure investment fund) over a period of time, for which we have in-principle permission from the government. It may take two-three years, but we will do that. What about plans to exit L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd (IDPL)? We have a term sheet with a prominent investor. We have our stake down to 51 percent already. During the course of the year, we will move IDPL away from our balance sheet; it will no longer be an L&T company. It is a work in progress and we’ll announce it as it happens. What’s the plan for the sale of your only thermal power generation unit, the Nabha power plant in Punjab? We are talking to an investor and we hope to move the project away from our balance sheet more or less by the end of the year. L&T’s overall debt is Rs 1,24,000 crore, out of that Rs 84,000 crore is from L&T Financial Services, which is not really a debt but their borrowing so that they can lend. So the real debt was Rs 40,000 crore. If Hyderabad Metro’s Rs 13,000 crore debt, Nabha Power’s Rs 6,000 crore debt move away, all we have is debt of Rs 20,000 crore, which is what the working capital requirement of L&T is. We can become a zero debt company by the later part of the year. L&T’s chairman AM Naik refers to some of the new businesses as “Subrahmanyan’s startups”. What’s the plan with that? And could we potentially see more IPOs (initial public offerings) from the L&T group? He is a lovely boss. And he has his ways of going about things. We have, with his views on it, started two or three startups within the company. One is L&T EduTech, which is in the higher education space for engineering studies. We started it as a B2B platform, it seems to have done well. We’ve got more than 80,000 students enrolled right now. We will also end up doing professional teaching as well as move into vocational training. It has been received well. It is something unique that we are trying as most of the education startups are in the K10, K-12 and other such spaces. It is the first time we are offering engineering as an e-commerce solution. Second, we have a startup called SuFin, which is for trade of engineering goods between MSMEs, SMEs and medium industries. It is doing sales of Rs 15 crore per month and seems to be doing well. This is again a unique space. Time will tell whether the new initiatives are good startups or where it goes. I hope I can repeat the winning formula. You announced the much-awaited L&T Infotech-Mindtree merger last week. Since then you have been talking to investors, employees and other stakeholders. From these interactions, do you anticipate any challenges? There are no challenges. When we acquired Mindtree, you were the first person to pull me up to ask when we were going to merge it (with L&T Infotech). We could not do it at that time because ownership issues had to be settled at the company. We did that, we have now grown it. It has come back to 25 percent growth. So it has achieved what it needed to achieve. It also so happened that around the time we took over, Covid happened and Mindtree was big in travel and hospitality, and both sectors went down pretty bad. Now that we have brought it back, it is logical to put the two companies together. To have two IT companies, which have more or less the same offerings but in different sectors, was not the right way to go forward beyond a point of time. The L&T Infotech and Mindtree merged entity will have a very positive effect on clients as they will be able to source solutions from the same organisation. You have a presence across the supply chain in the power sector. Looking at the looming power crisis in the country, and the steps announced by the government so far, do you have any suggestions on what can be done to resolve the issue? I think the government is doing the right thing. Coal-fired has become a bad word across the globe and COP26 and other sustainability criteria are coming in very heavily. I think we are already taking steps which are late, we need to take these steps in a very, very hurried manner across the globe, not specific to India. India does not have any other resources. Coal is our biggest resource and is available in plenty. But we have shifted our views and we have started putting up more solar, hydrogen, nuclear and such other plants. Power is a very sensitive topic in India; it’s sort of a political animal where a lot of subsidy takes place and the discoms and gencos are not in the best of health. But that’s a subject that needs to be discussed in a different forum. Nothing can be done by me making a request right now. But we are very clear that coal-fired units will slow down from an EPC point of view. What about your power equipment joint venture with Mitsubishi? It is a work in progress. It’s not our own decision as we hold 51 percent but we have an excellent relationship with them. We are talking to them, they’re also worried. They also have coal- and gas-powered factories in other parts of the world. So both of us are in a dialogue and if something else comes out of it, we’ll do that. Otherwise, we will have to jointly think of how to take it forward, including making electrolysers and such in those factories. L&T stands at a juncture where the order book is at a record high and you have so many different businesses across so many geographies, each with its own story. How do you divide time between the businesses? What part of your job takes more time? Once you become a CEO, nobody wants you to be in their business. L&T is run by vertical heads. All my colleagues are fantastic and lovely people, they don’t want me to interfere with their business at all. And they’re doing quite well. So I’m happy coming to the office, having a cup of tea, talking to you and going back! (He says this laughing.)

7,Sanjiv Kapoor writes letter to Jet Airways staff: Here's the full text,business," Sanjiv Kapoor, the newly-appointed chief executive of Jet Airways, in a letter to his employees has asked them to work on ‘five foundation blocks’ in the next few months before the re-launch of the airline. In his letter on May 13, Kapoor said his ‘five foundation blocks’ will focus on securing Air Operator Certificate, buying new aircraft, having robust systems and processes to support operations, securing slots, and building a new team of employees. Below is the full text. Read on: Dear colleagues, It has already been over a month since I joined the team as your CEO, and I wanted to write to you all today to tell you about my impressions-to-date, our immediate, collective priorities, and the kind of organization and airline we want to become. COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. At the outset, I want to tell you that I couldn’t be more excited to have joined Jet Airways. It’s an honor for me lead the revival of this world-class airline; a brand that millions of travelers and so many organizations around the world continue to love and respect. As you may know, I have worked with several other airlines in the last two decades and more, and so I have very closely followed Jet Airways’ journey. I’ve always had an enormous admiration for the airline, its people, and its expertise. My decision to join Jet Airways was driven in great measure by the immense goodwill this brand continues to enjoy, and by the passion and commitment of the JKC Consortium to revive the airline. We all meet people every now and then who have such fond memories of flying Jet Airways, and who keep asking when we are coming back. That’s the goodwill this airline has cultivated and that is the legacy that we – you, me, and everyone here – have been entrusted to carry forward. I truly believe that we are creating history together, and we are just getting started! As I love saying, this is a marathon, not a sprint. It’s going to need all of us to come together, help each other out, back each other, and, above all, reach for the stars. Broadly, there are 10 guiding principles that we will need to follow to make this happen and to take this airline to its past glory and beyond. I spoke about many of these points in my address to some of you on my first day here, but I want to place it on record for all. Safety first, always: As an airline, safety is paramount. There will be absolutely no room for short-cuts or compromises on safety. Ever! Nothing more needs to be said on this, this rule can never be violated. Values and principles guide us, not some rigid rulebook: We will run this company through a mix of common-sense, values, and principles – and not by some ‘rigid’ rulebook. At all levels, people will be empowered to make decisions by values and common-sense; values such as respect, fairness, empathy, transparency, decency, and hard work. We will not look to capitalize on the misfortunes of the people we interact and work with – whether it is our customers or staff. Now I don’t mean there will be no rules or processes or procedures to be followed when operating the airline or handling passengers. I mean this as the foundation of our culture and how we treat each other and others we interact with. So how do we lead with values and principles? It is by following the “Golden Rule”: Do onto others, as you would have them do onto you. In other words, don’t do something which you wouldn’t like being done with you. To reiterate, do the right thing, be fair, be respectful, and use common sense and empathy as your constant guide. Put yourself in the customers’, candidates’, suppliers, or team members’, or former employees’ shoes and think, how would you like to be handled if in the same situation? How would you feel if you were not treated respectfully or fairly? A culture based on love (and not fear), passion, and mutual respect: We are in aviation because, within all of us, there exists a child that watched a plane fly across the sky with open-mouthed wonder. Remember why you’re here, remember that sense of wonder – and everything will make sense. We will create a workspace environment that we look forward to coming to every morning. To a workplace where we all treat each other with respect. It doesn’t matter who is placed where in our organization chart - a junior member of the staff or a senior one, a contractor, vendor, or someone from outside of this organization, we treat EVERYONE with respect and courtesy. No exceptions. Respect means also respect other peoples’ time, respond to their emails and requests in a timely manner, follow-up and stick to commitments and timelines. Open, transparent & regular communication: We will have an open-door policy. Anyone is free to walk in to talk to the senior management representatives if the doors to their cabins are open. We will discuss our thoughts, ideas, and suggestions with each other, whenever we want to. Keep communication channels open, communicate frequently, overcommunicate if required, and be transparent. We honestly don’t have time to indulge in petty things such as gossip, leaks of confidential information, and anonymous letters designed to ruin careers. Such letters will be shredded and thrown away. Accountability is paramount and if there are any wrongdoings, please do report them through the correct channels, in this case, the whistle-blower process that will soon be institutionalized. While we have been focused on the AOP, aircraft, people, and systems decisions in recent weeks, as we set up our teams and bring on board the remaining HODs, I will also institute weekly meetings where everything is discussed openly and as ONE TEAM! Where we work together rather than in silos. Where we pitch in and support each other rather than say “that’s not my job”. Where we share openly rather than hold information as power. Where we all have a say but realise that eventually there is a certain hierarchy that is in place to make the best decisions after considering all inputs. Decisions once made, with due consideration and after considering all viewpoints, should not be second-guessed. That is the culture we want to create. No politics: I know we all have our political views, but let’s keep that outside of the office, please. There’s only one party and one team that matters here: Jet Airways. No “chalta hai” attitude: This is my biggest bugbear, and something there will be no room for at Jet Airways. “Chalta hai” will not work here, and ‘not possible’ is not an answer. Everything is possible, we just need to know how long it will take and how much it will cost. Focus on the basics and pay attention to the details – the small things make a big difference! Professional always: We are in the people and customer service business, we just happen to fly planes! Professionalism is sacrosanct here. We will always maintain the highest standard of professionalism, whether it’s in our dealings or in our appearances, at work or outside of work. The same high standards must also reflect in the smallest and biggest of our actions, including acknowledgement of emails (even if you don’t have an answer right away, acknowledge the email and indicate by when you may have the answer), timely responses and follow-ups, sticking to commitments, and ensuring punctuality & due preparedness for meetings, etc. A focus on output and a bias for action: The results and the output each one of us drives will be the final adjudicator for efforts and contribution, and not face-time. We will not judge on the clock. At the same time, we are a team and to ensure collaboration, we must respect core business hours as well. Output means getting things done, driving things to closure. We must not suffer from the “MAFA syndrome”: Mistaking Articulation for Action. Just saying it, or saying it will get done (“ho jayega”), does not get things done. Execution is key! Take ownership and drive things to closure within defined timelines – and closure means 100% closed, not 90% done – only then will excellence be our benchmark. A desire to “Think Different” while being customer-driven: Think Different was a path-breaking slogan adopted by Steve Jobs in Apple back in 1984. And by thinking different, they changed the world – multiple times! We too must be driven by the desire to think different.  To not just be a copy-paste of other airlines. To not just look in the rear-view mirror and plan the future based on the past, but to change the way business is done in the future! To find new ways to delight customers and create customer advocacy by realising the customer is not an ATM machine to be shaken-down at every opportunity like we sadly see commonly across the industry today, rather the customer is what our business, salaries, and long-term success depend on! Driven by technology, but with a human touch: I like to say Jet Airways is a people-focused airline for the digital age.  We will have the best app, website, and IT systems and services possible. However, we will not give up the human touch – there will always be the option to speak with a human. We are in the people and customer business.  Human interaction cannot be fully replaced by technology – it must always be there as a backup, especially when things go wrong (during IROPS, etc). I am focused on the following five foundation blocks which we will need to work over the next few months, for which we all need to be on top of our game. AOC – Securing the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) at the earliest is our top priority right now. We will be conducting our proving flight very soon, the last step before AOC. We will completely change gears after AOC and ramp up all of the factors listed below in order to be ready to begin operations in the July – September quarter this year. People – The Top 3 priorities for any CEO should be to 1. Create the right culture 2. Hire the best people, treat them well, and pay them fairly and on-time 3. Help develop the best strategy. In that order. We are setting ambitious targets for ourselves, and to achieve them, we will build a super-amazing team of talented and passionate people who believe in our story. Our vision for Jet Airways is simple: to build a ‘people-focused airline for the digital age’. We will make the right investments and hire people who are in tune with the culture we are trying to create and with the vision that we have about how to run a better airline. I have been disproportionately focused on people and working with Nakul and team to cast the net wider and hire the very best, as eventually it is the people, the team, that will make the airline. Aircraft – We’ve already in talks with the major aircraft manufacturers and lessors, studying all options available to us. We want to be fully aware of all available products and the possibilities we can achieve with each of them. We will soon take a call on the kind of aircraft that aligns with our long-term plans, and announce the decision soon after AOC. Software and Systems – We will build and set up robust systems and processes to support operations on the ground and in the air to ensure we run like clockwork, to make sure we play more than lip-service to the term “digital”, and to ensure we take care of the basic needs and pain-points of all stakeholders consistently and reliably before we aim for fancy stuff. Consider me a simpleton. Buzzwords like Metaverse, Blockchain, IoT, AI, ML, Big Data, Chat Bots, and What Nots mean nothing to me. What matters is a website that works. An app that is not stuck in a time warp. Error messages that are not gibberish geek-speak. OTPs that are actually delivered. Passwords that can actually be reset. Payments that can actually succeed. CAPTCHAS that can be deciphered. Booking / redemption flows that actually make sense. And humans you can actually speak to. And similarly for our internal systems and supporting IT infrastructure. Slots (& other airport infrastructure) – Once we receive the AOC, we will immediately start working on securing slots and pursue our other infrastructural requirements at airports that we will be operating at. To sum it up, we have made excellent progress so far, thanks to the efforts of ALL of you! But this was just the beginning. Things are going to change into a completely different gear now, and the ride is going to get a lot more intense! We need to create a culture of openness, accountability, teamwork, and excellence, give it our 200% and take ownership of whatever we are entrusted with. We are together going to create history - for the first time in the history of Indian aviation, an airline is being revived. We must fire on all cylinders and WORK AS ONE TEAM!  Let the revived Jet Airways not only match the very high standards of the Jet Airways we all knew and loved, but exceed them! I know I can count on your support, and I’m looking forward to creating history with all of you.  The proving flight is now around the corner, and after that, our AOC!

8,"Interview: Elevated inflation here to stay, repo rate could be 5.5% by December, says HSBC’s Pranjul Bhandari",business," India’s retail inflation in April was at an eight-year high of 7.79 percent, sending alarm bells ringing across markets and triggering expectations of large rate hikes. Is this the peak of inflation? Where will it go from here? In an interview with Moneycontrol, Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist of HSBC, explains that inflation could continue to stay elevated as price pressures tend to be sticky. More than headline inflation, the momentum should worry policymakers. The Reserve Bank of India may announce one more 40 basis point hike in the repo rate in June. Bhandari sees the central bank taking the rate from 4.4 percent now to 5.5 percent by December in its fight against inflation. Beyond that, rate hikes need to be very careful. Edited excerpts: Q: Has inflation peaked? How would be the trajectory ahead? A: We have a base effect coming in May and June. So, in these two months, CPI inflation will be around 7 percent. But don’t mistake it for actual inflation momentum coming off. My sense is even with these numbers, quarter-on-quarter sequential momentum will remain as elevated as it was in April. In fact, considering the passthrough stickiness, the momentum of the last few months is going to probably stay for the rest of the year. So we should be tracking month-on-month, quarter-on-quarter movements closely. Q: What is your assessment on food inflation? Are edible oil and now wheat the only pain points? Is it more generalised? A: I think the pressure is across the board. Agricultural input costs have gone up as well. In our last reading, agriculture input cost inflation was 15 percent year-on-year – that’s a pretty high number. So, this is the cost to plant new crops and when the harvest season comes, farmers increase the final prices to recoup that upfront expenditure made. And that’s why we may see a lot of the food price pressures in the months to come. But I would not call it structural yet. I will say that India has seen high inflation even before global inflation picked up, but that high inflation was more led by core inflation and not as much by food. Remember when the RBI presented its policy in April, it was still sounding very positive on the food inflation outlook. But the commentary following the surprise hike in May was on the upcoming price pressures on the food side. So that is a key change in the story. Q: A lot of inflation pressure is through commodity prices and their passthrough. Has the complete passthrough happened or will we see more increases? A: Generally, the passthrough from producers to consumers is about 50-60 percent of input cost increases. So far, it is clear that the passthrough for goods manufacturers has been pretty strong. It’s the service providers who are not passing on as quickly and I think there is a reason. Goods demand was a story of last year and a story that has run a good cycle. Goods producers have had the liberty to pass on rather than take it on their margins. Services demand story started this year because only by January a critical mass of Indians got vaccinated and started moving around. So the growth in services demand is still playing out and I think my suspicion is that a lot of service providers are feeling a little uncomfortable about raising prices very quickly. So my sense is that so far goods inflation is far outpacing services. But eventually services inflation will catch up. Q: We have had a very sticky core inflation in the past. Will this continue to cause discomfort? A: I must say that India’s core inflation has been surprisingly high, even before global pressures picked up. Even in 2020, we had core inflation north of 6 percent and it has been a problem since then. There are very India-centric factors at play here. During the lockdown, small firms got disrupted and many had to shut shop or did not have buffers to withstand the long lockdown. These small informal firms were producers of necessary goods like clothes and food items, and there is a certain inelasticity of prices on these. The other story is that big firms got bigger, they gained pricing power, and they began passing on price hikes. I think a combination of these two explains why core inflation was high even when GDP showed a double-digit contraction. Now what we see is that manufacturers are facing commodity price shocks and they have to eventually pass these on to consumers. And that kind of freezes (core) inflation at a level. Q: What will contribute to this stickiness? A: Core inflation exhibits a huge amount of stickiness. I think that inflation is going to be sticky for three reasons. I think number one is the pricing power. Firms increase prices when commodity prices rise, but will they cut when prices fall? We will have to see. The second is the fuel index. Some parts of the fuel index, like kerosene and diesel, are non-regulated and their prices have really gone up. But some other items such as electricity tariffs, have not. Electricity is a big part of the urban basket. Kerosene and biodiesel are a big part of the rural basket. This also explains why rural inflation is higher than urban. Discoms typically do not increase tariffs immediately, it takes 12-18 months to do that. So my sense is that the increase here will start kicking in one year down the line and that might be another source of sticky inflation. A third source of sticky inflation is just the harvest cycles in agriculture. The whole cycle from sowing to harvest takes about six months. So the initial expenditure is recovered through prices only after some months, when the harvest is sold. And the producer would want to keep the price high, given the initial investment. This will make agricultural prices stay high for long. Q: You have explained stickiness elaborately. So can we conclude that the easing of inflation is going to be a slow process? A: If we think of 4 percent, I think it is going to take several years to get there. In my forecast, we can get to 6.8 percent this year. For the next year, headline inflation can go down to 5.5 percent. These are our forecasts and include both base effects as well as a slower economic growth in the second half of this year. But even 5.5 percent for me is a very high number. Q: So what does this mean for monetary policy? Do you anticipate bigger hikes? A: They have done the 40 basis point surprise hike and we expect another 40 bps in the June policy. But after that, we see a 25 bps hike trajectory and not a series of 40 bps. Secondly, we think the RBI will have a couple of pitstops. So the first one would be 5.15 percent repo rate, which I think would be by September. This level was the pre-pandemic repo rate level. The second pitstop would be 5.5 percent and we think we will get there by December. This is an important pitstop because our one-year-ahead inflation forecast is 5.5 percent. At this point, we are out of negative real interest rates. Beyond this, the hikes would be a function of what happens to growth to a large extent. If the RBI believes that the labour markets are at equilibrium and the economy is doing well, then they can take the real rates from neutral level to 1 percent. But we are not forecasting a 6.5 percent repo rate for that 1 percent real rate. What we think is that the RBI will go halfway, to 6 percent repo rate. This is the terminal repo rate I am looking at. I also want to say that the stickiness of inflation does not necessarily mean aggressive RBI rate hikes. The reason is that there’s only so much the RBI can do when the source of the problem is supply side. They can only take care of the second-round effect and that also with a lag and with a side-effect of slowing growth. So at some point, we have to understand that the RBI has a fine balancing act to do. Q: Do you see significant downside risks to growth, especially because of inflation? A: For FY23, we have a GDP growth forecast of 6.8 percent, which is lower than the consensus. Currently, the pent-up services demand is playing out. We have not seen the export story get hurt so far. But these things can change. Our worry is that in the second half of the year, a couple of things will change. One is that services demand would have run its course. Urban purchasing power will also come off a little bit in the second half of the year. The informal sector was doing pretty badly at the start of the pandemic in 2020 during the lockdown, then it recovered. Our sense is that ever since this commodity price shock has hit, the informal sector is again hurting and that could lead to repercussions.

9,Jet Airways' Sanjiv Kapoor asks employees to work on five 'foundation blocks' in next few months,business," Sanjiv Kapoor, the newly-appointed chief executive of Jet Airways, in a letter to his employees has asked them to work on 'five foundation blocks' in the next few months before the re-launch of the airline. In his letter on May 13, Kapoor said that his 'five foundation blocks' to focus on were securing Air Operator Certificate, buying new aircraft, having robust systems and processes to support operations, securing slots, and building a new team of employees. ALSO READ: Home Ministry grants security clearance to Jet Airways ""Securing the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) at the earliest is our top priority right now,"" Kapoor said, adding that Jet Airways will be conducting its proving flight very soon. He added that the airline will look to return to the Indian skies by the July-September quarter. COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. Jet Airways is already in talks with major aircraft manufacturers and lessors and will soon take a call on the kind of aircraft to procure which aligns with the airline's long-term plans, added Kapoor. He said that the airline will immediately start working on securing slots and pursue our other infrastructural requirements at airports, once it gets its AOC. Kapoor asked his employees to focus on building robust systems and processes to support operations on the ground and in the air to ensure that Jet Airways runs like clockwork. ""What matters is a website that works. An app that is not stuck in a time warp. Error messages that are not gibberish geek-speak. OTPs that are actually delivered. Passwords that can actually be reset. Payments that can actually succeed. CAPTCHAS that can be deciphered. Booking / redemption flows that actually make sense. And humans you can actually speak to,"" Kapoor said in his letter. He added that Jet Airways will look to create the right culture, hire the best people, treat them well, pay them fairly and on time and help develop the best strategy for operations. In his e-mail, Kapoor said that his employees should focus on the ""Golden Rule""- Do onto others, as you would have them do onto you. ""In other words, don’t do something which you wouldn’t like being done with you. To reiterate, do the right thing, be fair, be respectful, and use common sense and empathy as your constant guide. Put yourself in the customers’, candidates’, suppliers, or team members’, or former employees’ shoes and think, how would you like to be handled if in the same situation? How would you feel if you were not treated respectfully or fairly?"" Kapoor said. The letter from Kapoor comes a few days after the airline conducted its test flight to get the AOC. Aviation regulator - Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)- grants operators license to fly their aircraft for commercial purposes after they conduct successful test flights. Jet Airways had conducted a test flight on May 5 to and from Hyderabad airport as it is gearing up to re-launch operations under its new promoters Jalan-Kalrock Consortium.

10,Sebi extends relaxation till Dec on listed cos' sending hard copies of annual reports to shareholders,business," Capital markets regulator Sebi on Friday extended the relaxation to listed companies whereby they will not be required to dispatch physical copies of annual reports to their shareholders till December this year. The decision has been taken after Sebi received multiple representations from listed companies, seeking dispensation from the requirements of sending hard copies of annual reports to the shareholders. Against this backdrop, the watchdog has decided to provide relaxation up to December 31, 2022, from the LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, which require companies to send hard copies of annual reports to the shareholders who have not registered their email addresses, according to a circular. Further, the notice of the Annual General Meeting published by advertisement in terms of LODR rules should contain a link to the annual report so as to enable shareholders to have access to the full annual report. ""It is however emphasized that in terms of… LODR Regulations, listed entities are required to send hard copy of the full annual report to those shareholders who request for the same,"" Sebi said. Further, the requirement of sending proxy forms has been dispensed with up to December 31, 2022, in case of general meetings held through electronic mode only, as per the circular. The new framework will come into force with immediate effect, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said. Earlier, the regulator had given similar relaxations to listed companies till December 2021.  The latest move also comes after the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) on May 5 extended the relaxations from dispatching of physical copies of financial statements for the year 2022 till December 31, 2022.

11,Croatia passes law paving way for euro currency introduction,business," Croatian lawmakers on Friday approved a law that paves the way for the introduction of the euro currency next year. Croatia is due to replace the Croatian kuna with the euro on Jan 1, 2023. Lawmakers voted 117-13 in favor of legislation to bring in the euro. One lawmaker abstained in the 151-member parliament. Croatia, which joined the European Union in 2013, remains among the weaker economies of the block following the war in 1992-95. Right-wing parties in the Croatian parliament were opposed to the introduction of the euro, saying it would increase poverty and put pressure on the citizens. Both currencies are set to be in parallel use in the months after the formal start of the euro application. Croatia's economy is dependent on tourism revenue during the summer months. The country draws hundreds of thousands of European and other global tourists each season. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
12,Tesla India team starts working for Asia-Pacific region: Report,business," The Indian arm of US-based electric vehicle giant Tesla Inc has initiated working on Asia-Pacific (APAC) market, as New Delhi is yet to slash the import duties on EVs, a report citing industry sources has claimed. Most members of the Tesla India team are ""mainly working for the Middle-East markets"" and have travelled to Dubai for the same, the EU Auto report further said, citing a person privy to the matter. Tesla's APAC business unit also oversees the sales in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Taiwan. The company's charging manager for India unit, Nishant Prasad, has changed his designation on LinkedIn to 'Charging Operations Lead-APAC'. Manoj Khurana, who was the first employee to be hired by Tesla in India, shifted to California in April to take up a product role in the company, the report added. The news of Tesla's India unit members being assigned to other geographical locations gained further credence on May 13, when a Reuters report claimed that Tesla has abandoned its entry plans in India amid the deadlock over the import duties. The company has shelved its plans to sell electric cars in the country, abandoned a search for showroom space and reassigned some of its domestic team after failing to secure lower import taxes, three people familiar with the matter told the news agency. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the developments. The import duty in India on EVs priced $40,000 or lower is 60 percent, whereas, it is 100 percent on those priced above $40,000. The Tesla India team, which is headed by US-based Indian executive Prashanth Menon, had been reportedly lobbying to bring down the duties on EVs. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government did not offer a concession, Tesla put on hold the plans to import cars into India, the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The spokesperson for Tesla, as well as the Indian government, were yet to react to the reports.

15,Mopa airport nears completion; how a second airport will change Goa,business," The construction of the Mopa airport located in the North Goa district is 75 percent complete, according to Goa’s state director of civil aviation Sunil Shanbhogue. ""Work on connectivity from the runway to the passenger terminal is underway,” he told the media recently. The Mopa airport is being built by GMR Group’s special purpose vehicle Goa International Airport Limited (GGIAL). Airports Authority of India (AAI) has already received the handover of the technical building. Air traffic control (ATC) is slated to receive the handover of the building next week. Recruited staff too has been sent to Uttar Pradesh and Hyderabad for training in baggage screening, airport rescue and firefighting. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to inaugurate the airport on August 15, 2022, 76th Independence Day. Why is it in the news? Goa’s only existing airport in Dabolim is located in a military airfield owned by the Indian Navy. The combined flow of civilian and military traffic on the single-runway increases the airside congestion. The Mopa airport aims at enhancing Goa’s connectivity by air, by aiding the flow of civilian traffic to the state. The total cost of building the airport reached Rs 2,615 crore due to delays in court proceedings which included judicial stay orders on the construction owing to the project’s environmental impact. On January 16, 2020, however, the Supreme Court upheld the project’s Environmental Clearance allowing construction to resume. Later on, the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic hindered the construction process. Mopa airport which is being built under the BOT model (Build, Operate and Transfer) will be operated through GGIAL by GMR for a period of 40 years, extendable by 20 years, as per broad lease agreements. Impact on Goan economy The coastal state of Goa is famous for its beaches and attracts tourists from across the world. The construction of the Mopa airport can drastically increase the number of tourists which in turn can unlock Goa’s real-estate potential. “On an average, properties in Goa can yield 12-16 percent returns annually. Competitive real estate prices, when compared to metro cities of India, is yet another major reason why investing in a holiday home in Goa seems to be a profitable option,” said Shephali Kapoor in a signed post on 99acres.com, a real estate portal. Mopa airport’s location also enhances North Goa’s real estate capabilities as it is better developed and has tons of recreational options and tourist attractions, thereby offering better rental and resale rates. According to a report by Savills India, a real estate consultancy, Goa seems to be the top choice for Indians looking for a second home. Almost a fifth of the respondents who were part of the survey indicated an interest in buying a second home in Goa.

16,Indian exchanges delist Luna after its price crashed below $1,business," After global exchanges, Indian exchanges including WazirX, Coinswitch Kuber, and CoinDCX have delisted the stablecoin Luna. The Terra crypto token was taken down as its price fell below $1, eroding the wealth of its investors. In its blogpost, WazirX said, “At WazirX, we periodically review each token we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect. When a coin or token no longer meets this standard or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it. We believe this best protects all our users.” It was based on factors like the commitment of the team to the project, level and quality of development activity, trading volume and liquidity, stability, and safety of the network from attacks among others. “The last few days have been tough for all of us. The meltdown of the #Terra ecosystem and LUNA have been rapid and devastating. After careful deliberation, we have decided to delist #LUNA from @CoinSwitchKuber,” tweeted Ashish Singhal, founder of Coinswitch Kuber. For the uninitiated, Luna’s downfall started when its sister token UST, which is also a stablecoin, was 'depegged' from its $1 value as big investors started dumping it.

17,Axis Mutual Fund case: 'Investors should wait for investigation to get over before taking a call on their investments’,business," Axis Mutual Fund has suspended two fund managers, one of whom is a dealer, as it investigates possible irregularities at the fund house. While the exact nature of the wrongdoing is not known, there have been allegations of frontrunning. The fund house said it started a suo moto investigation in February, using external advisors. In this week’s edition of Money Matters, we spoke with Sandeep Parekh, founder of Finsec Law Advisors and a former executive director of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Feroze Azeez, deputy CEO at Anand Rathi Wealth, Kirtan Shah, founder of Credence Wealth Advisors, and Amit Bivalkar, founder of Sapient Wealth Advisors & Brokers. Could Axis MF have handled the situation differently? What can it do to keep its credibility intact? Our panel of experts shed light on these and other questions. Edited excerpts: Listen to the full recording of Twitter spaces here. Is it odd that while the investigation was launched in February, unit holders were kept in the dark? Sandeep Parekh: This is somewhat of a tricky question. When do you disclose something as serious as what allegedly is frontrunning? In mutual funds, that is one of the biggest offences you can do because you are really shaking people’s trust in the entire fund house, not just those particular schemes where this might be happening. So, it is like one of the most negative events in a mutual fund’s life journey. If I were to advise them, I would have also probably told them that till the time you have some prima-facie evidence, don’t disclose it because it may be premature. What if you find that nothing wrong happened and it is some kind of prima facie view you had built? At least a lawyer would advise them to have something in hand before they go to the public. This is exactly what SEBI also does, right? Until there is some kind of order, nothing really is in the public domain. So, show-cause notices are not put in the public domain. So, I think I really can’t fault the fact that they disclosed something now, whereas the probe started in February. So, that bit sounds okay to me. Should a simultaneous probe be conducted by SEBI? Parekh: So, what I know about SEBI, I am almost 99 percent sure they would have started that already. When you look at the various industries and markets that are regulated by SEBI, mutual funds are at the extreme end of the supervision that they go through. It is a very crucial segment for SEBI because it has a lot of retail participation and a lot of small investors participating. Someone with Rs 20 would also have invested in a mutual fund. Therefore, SEBI is very sensitive about any kind of malpractice, even if it is a small valuation error. In this case, we are possibly talking about one of the cardinal sins as far as mutual funds are concerned. So, I will be highly surprised if SEBI has not already initiated a probe into this. And I am almost certain that they would have started it already. What would Axis MF need to do to win back credibility? Could it have done anything differently in handling the matter? Amit Bivalkar: I think we are jumping the gun in thinking that whatever has happened or whatever is going to come out, we already know. So, I will wait for the findings of the investigation. Axis MF’s future course of action would depend on these findings. If we remember in Berkshire Hathaway’s takeover of Salomon Brothers, Warren Buffet famously told the employees of Salomon Brothers, “Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.” Every mutual fund in the country, the CEO, the board and everybody, is well aware of the importance of reputation in this business and they are generally ruthless when they find any irregularities. I don’t think Axis MF is any exception. If they find people are guilty, they should take legal action against them. In terms of communication, Axis MF has sent a letter to investors, but I didn’t find any apology in that letter. So, firstly, one should apologise if they say that there is an irregularity found. So, an apology has to go to the investors because of the fiduciary responsibility a mutual fund has towards the investors. This is very much needed. Is it surprising that the two fund managers in question were suspended only months after the investigation was initiated and not earlier? Feroze Azeez: I don’t think it is surprising. Here an investigation has taken place and people have concluded that further investigation is required. If any organisation starts to report to investors each of its investigations, then there would have been 10 they could have done in the last two years and one of them is of serious nature, which required any action. So, I don’t think when you initiate a probe, you need to disclose to everyone… So, it doesn’t surprise me that the two individuals in question continued till they got evidence and once they got evidence, they surgically replaced them in seven funds in one day, which I think is a courageous decision. I would respect that decision because you are surgically on one fine day changing them and they are also clarifying that SEBI has not started the probe and that this is a suo motu probe. If they are able to put that in the public domain, I am kind of okay and am not surprised. I think organisations would not disclose every internal investigation. Probably, in several AMCs, as we speak, there might be investigations going on, which may result in no wrongdoings. If you alert everyone every time about your investigation, it keeps investors unnecessarily on their toes. I hope if there is some conclusive evidence that there is wrongdoing, there has to be a severe punishment and a precedent has to be created. Debarring somebody from the capital markets and asking them to pay Rs 50 lakh-Rs 1 crore fine is the least punishment. How should investors of Axis MF schemes read this whole situation? Kirtan Shah: Right now, these are just allegations and we don’t know how deep they are, which schemes got directly or indirectly affected by this. So right now, to judge what schemes and to what extent they would have been affected would be anyone’s guess. Of the seven schemes that got affected, four were ETFs, one was arbitrage. I don’t think those schemes would have largely got affected in any material way. If you look at quant and value schemes, the AUMs of these funds are pretty less and hopefully the number of investors are small in these two schemes. These are new funds, without even much of a track record. So for investors, it is advisable to wait for some time, see what comes out and then take a step. Beyond these seven schemes, Axis MF’s other schemes have been extremely popular among investors. These schemes are also sitting on large amounts of cash holdings. So, if any redemptions were to happen in Axis MF’s other schemes, these are well-placed to deal with it. So, other investors who want to stay invested in other schemes of Axis MF are not likely to get impacted, even if there is a set of investors that decide to withdraw their allocation from Axis MF.

22,"Eicher Motors Q4 results | Consolidated net profit up 34% QoQ at Rs 610 crore; revenue grows to Rs 3,193 crore",business," Eicher Motors Ltd on May 13 declared a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 610 crore for the quarter ended March 2022, up 16 percent from Rs 526 crore in the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, the growth in profit was 34 percent from Rs 456 crore in the previous quarter. The maker of iconic Royal Enfield reported a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 8.6 percent in its consolidated revenue at Rs 3,193 crore from Rs 2,940 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Sequentially, revenues rose 11 percent from Rs 2,881 crore in the December quarter. For the full year, from April 2021–March 2022, PAT jumped 25 percent to Rs 1,677 crore from Rs 1,347 crore in FY21. Consolidated revenues rose by 18 percent to Rs 10,298 crore from Rs 8,720 in the previous financial year. The growth was led by YoY increase in average selling prices (ASPs) due to a richer model mix and price hikes taken over the past few quarters. This, however, was partly offset by YoY decline in volumes for Royal Enfield. Costs The lower volumes led to decrease in raw material costs as a percentage of revenue from operations to 57 percent compared to 61 percent during the corresponding period last year. The raw material costs however are higher compared to the preceding quarter when they had stood at mere 49 percent of revenue from operations due to significant decline in volumes. Employee costs dipped marginally by 100 bps on year to 7 percent of revenue from operations. On a sequential basis, the employee costs were stable. Other expenses on the other hand picked up 100 bps from last year to 13 percent and were stable on a sequential basis. Dividend The company approved a dividend of Rs 21 per equity share of face value of Re 1 each for the financial year ended March 31, 2022.
