2,Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky explains a better version of hybrid work,trends," Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has given his employees the liberty to work from wherever they want and now has some tips for other organisations. In an interview with Inc. magazine, Chesky said he did not believe that the hybrid method -- asking employees to come to office two to three days per week -- will work. That form of hybrid work does not provide professionals a lot more flexibility than the pre-pandemic period, Chesky said. “Maybe instead of asking you to come in three days a week, which I don't think will work because three days a week will become two days a week, and two days a week will become one day a week, and then everyone comes in the office a different one day a week,” the Airbnb CEO continued. He said he envisioned a different kind of hybrid work. “Where we combined the efficiency of Zoom with the infrequency, but the meaningfulness, of interpersonal interaction by getting together one week a quarter,” he told the magazine. “And frankly, if that's not enough, we can adjust it.” Chesky said a better version of the hybrid model would be assuming that people will be wherever they work best. He told Inc. magazine that those who want everyone back to working from office are over 50. Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "

7,Sinkhole with forest at bottom: Chinese scientists make astounding discovery,trends," A team of scientists in China has discovered a massive sinkhole with a forest inside it, Xinhua news agency reported. The discovery was made in the country’s southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region -- home to giant sinkholes and caves, science news website Live Science reported. The US Geological Survey defines sinkholes as depressions which have no natural external surface drainage. Sinkholes are most common in karst terrains. ""These are regions where the types of rock below the land surface can naturally be dissolved by groundwater circulating through them,"" USGS added. ""When water from rainfall moves down through the soil, these types of rock begin to dissolve. This creates underground spaces and caverns."" In China, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has been designated as UNESCO world heritage site because of its striking karst terrain. Last week, a team from the Institute of Karst Geology of the China Geological Survey travelled down the 192-metre-deep sinkhole in the region to discover a well-preserved forest. Apart from China, such massive sinkholes have been found in Papua New Guinea and Mexico. International cave expert George Veni told Live Science that the appearance of such formations differed with climate, geology and other factors. ""So in China you have this incredibly visually spectacular karst with enormous sinkholes and giant cave entrances and so forth,"" he said. ""In other parts of the world you walk out on the karst and you really don't notice anything. Sinkholes might be quite subdued, only a meter or two in diameter. Cave entrances might be very small, so you have to squeeze your way into them."" Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
8,Storyboard18 x Just Sports | TCS World 10K returns with runners and brands ready at the start line,trends," 4 am alarm, pre-race meal, coordinating with buddies to reach the venue, never-ending conversation on pacing strategy, quick warms-up in the packed holding area…phew! All of it is making a comeback after two years this summer as Bengaluru opens its roads for runners running the TCS World 10K this weekend. Having run this event on two occasions in the past as a participant, I can vouch for the unparalleled energy that this event offers to those who choose to participate. And after two years of missing out on this kind of vibe and meeting my ‘running tribe’, I am all set to be on the start line of this race yet again. The excitement around this major on-ground event after two years of lockdowns is unprecedented. Vivek Singh, Joint MD, Procam International, says the registrations have been pouring in till last week. “In the last few days we have seen an upward trend in registrations. Keeping this in mind, we have kept registrations for a few categories open at the event expo which began from May 12 to ensure everyone gets an opportunity to be a part of the TCS World 10k. We are confident to see approximately 19,000 participants on the streets of Bengaluru this Sunday.” Tim Tim Sharma What runners have to say Tim Tim Sharma, 38, a popular runner from Bengaluru, shares how the excitement is already palpable, given that it is race week and many runners from across the country are in Bengaluru for the event. “It is going to be really great to meet all the familiar faces and welcome new ones,” she adds. “The TCS10k is a celebration of the sport of running. It is the day Bengaluru roads are shut and runners take over the streets for the first few hours of the morning. It is an initiation of thousands to the world of running, also a kick start to the racing season. It is a festival for the runners and I am proud to have run it two times in the past winning in my age category both times.” Nithin B. Jawali, 48, who has participated in this event on five occasions in the past, says: “The run is #nammarace, the pride of Bangalore and is known worldwide. It has been a long two years and I can’t wait to see all the runners on the road again.” Kshitij Sharma, a 34-year-old runner from Bengaluru, who will be running the event for the second time this year is also excited to meet fellow runners from different cities. “An event like this brings hope for so many recreational runners like me who get motivated to get back to training once they register for mega events like this,” Sharma says. Nithin Jawali Another popular runner and running coach from Bengaluru, Ankita Gaur, who had taken a break from running races due to pregnancy, will be running the event this year. She has participated in this event six times in the past. She tells Storyboard18, “This race will be very special for me as it will be my first race as a mother.” Thirty-nine-year-old ultra-runner Gunjan Khurana who will be travelling from Surat to not just run the event but also participate as pacer, helping many others meet their goals, is looking forward to running this marathon for the first time. Brands in for the long-run Shashank Mehta, founder and CEO of The Whole Truth Foods, will also be participating and he couldn’t hide his excitement. “Running is my first love. I started my fitness journey running, including a few marathons. This is the first large-scale running event since COVID, and I'm looking forward to running alongside some of the best runners in the country.” Mehta's brand is also the official snack for the TCS World 10K. The brand has planned an activation with a contingent of 80-90 runners who will run for ‘The Whole Truth’. “We have a community of highly accomplished runners and fitness experts and we've got some of them together for this run.” Take IDFC First Bank, for example. This is the first time IDFC First Bank has come on board as the associate sponsor. From this year, the Bank is a sponsor of Procam International’s four running events; TCS World 10K being first in the series. “These events have grown in international stature and repute over the last decade. As a bank, we believe in offering great value to customers, and viewed through that lens, a participative sport like marathons helps us connect well with our audience,” says Naarayan TV, chief marketing officer, IDFC FIRST Bank. Ankita Gaur As a special initiative, the Bank has announced a pledge to contribute to social causes on behalf of every participant completing the 10K run in 60 minutes at TCS World 10K Bengaluru. Naarayan TV says that this initiative aligns with the bank’s philosophy of being a force for social good and with the 10K Bengaluru’s theme of social inclusion. He says, “An association with a sport like marathon builds community spirit, promotes wellness and is a natural fit for our bank.” There are many other brands who have jumped on the 10K bandwagon. Volini, for example, will be ‘Recovery Partner’. Its recovery zone is equipped with sports scientists, injury management specialists, doctors and physiotherapists facilitating instant pain relief and tending to tired muscles to all open 10K participants. A direct approach to showcasing their brand promise to the consumer. Bisleri, on the other hand, will be ‘Hydration Partner’ to the event and will have 6 Bisleri water stations on the course and one post finish. Fast & Up is on board as the Energy Drink Partner. And then there is global IT major TCS who is on board as the title sponsor. Kshitij Sharma Spirit. Community. Brand Building. In an exclusive conversation with Storyboard18, Rajashree R, chief marketing officer of TCS, says she is excited to have runners on the street, although in the past the brand had enabled the virtual organisation of the event. “Sports in general pushes human ingenuity to its limit and there is a core belief that every human can do better. We are actively working with organisers to make sure that this is the most technologically advanced. Whether it is the TCS World 10K or the TCS New York City Marathon, all these events use our app, they use our tech. Even when we went virtual we used Augmented Reality to give runners the virtual experience of running the event,” she says, adding how races like these not just help them engage with their key stakeholders but also be a part of the spirit of that particular city.” According to the recently released Nielsen Global Sports Marketing report, sports sponsorship grew by 107% in 2021. And this growth is true for both spectator sports and participatory sports such as marathons and triathlons as well. Plus, partnerships with major participatory events like running are cost-effective and highly strategic solutions for brands to position themselves in the marketplace and reconnect with its consumers. These races are not just about the run day. For example, training for endurance sports and events such as running, cycling or triathlon starts up to 16 weeks or more before the race weekend. This allows a brand the opportunity to get right inside the life of a runner over an extended period of time and authentically become part of the journey. Sportswear brand ASICS is one such brand that has taken up interactive marketing approaches to create awareness and build curiosity for this event. The sportswear brand is running a local campaign ‘Bengaluru, Let’s have a Blast’ focused on educating the customer on its latest Flytefoam blast technology in shoes. On the race day, top 950 finishers in the Open 10K category across men and women will be presented with a t-shirt as a token of appreciation for their effort and hard work. Such an effort also provides means to continue the dialogue and build a relationship and portray them as a company that supported an individual’s accomplishment. And indeed, every runner loves to cherish the race memory with a finisher tee! Surat-based ultra-runner Gunjan Khurana. Creating brand experiences in a non-cluttered environment Rajat Khurana, managing director, ASICS India & South Asia, who is an accomplished runner himself says that this event is important for the brand to communicate with the running community in the southern part of India about various innovations and technologies that ASICS has to offer. “South India is an important market for us and we have 7 outlets in the city and 16 stores in the region. Through this partnership, we wish to enable runners across all age groups to push themselves to achieve new goals and experience the joy of running.” Creating a sense of community in a non-cluttered environment is attractive to brands that don’t want to pay big-ticket major league rights fees for events such as the IPL and have their brand reside in a sea of logos on ground. Apart from this, a running strategy can also enhance a corporate culture by bringing staff together and providing an inclusive employee engagement activity around which they can rally for a specific cause or purpose. The title sponsor TCS has been doing exactly this for many years now across various events and will see a huge employee participation for this event as well. “Every participant needs to be double vaccinated, there will be a temperature check upon entry, you can’t enter the venue without a mask, if you drop a mask we will provide you with one at the venue, such other protocols will be followed rigorously. Here is an opportunity for us to give courage to people and show them that things are getting back to normal,” says Singh. For those who still have jitters participating in the physical event have an option to run the virtual race wherever they are located, through a paid participation. According to Procam, there are thousands who have registered for the virtual race and even these runners will get a t-shirt and a medal.

9,"In Ukraine, 11-year-old takes care of mom, sister who lost their legs in Russian shelling",trends," For 11-year-old Yaroslav, life changed the moment a Russian missile strike hit a railway station in the Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk in April. Yaroslav, who was at the station with his mother and twin sister at the time, miraculously escaped without injuries, but his family was not as lucky. His mother, Natalia, and his sister, Yana, both lost their legs in the Russian shelling. For Yaroslav, it meant growing up overnight. The 11-year-old has been looking after his family in hospital since the day of the Kramatorsk station attack. 11yo Yaroslav is taking care of his mother Natalia and his twin Yana, who lost their legs in the shelling of #Kramatorsk railway station.Now they are in a Lviv hospital preparing for a prosthetic surgery in the USAIryna Zaslavets#StandWithUkraine️#StopRussianAggression pic.twitter.com/y52nSxqG9N Yaroslav’s story was shared by a hospital in Lviv, Ukraine, where his mother and sister have been receiving treatment since April 8, the day of the attack. According to a Facebook post by the St Nicholas Children’s Hospital of the First Medical Association of Lviv, Yaroslav, Yana and Natalia were among the thousands of Ukrainians who were waiting at the Kramatorsk station for evacuation trains when rockets hit. The twins don’t have a father. Their stepfather had already joined the fight against Russia when their mother, desperate to flee Russian shelling, took them to the station. She still blames herself for the tragedy that followed. While waiting for the train, Yana asked her mother for tea that was being distributed by volunteers. Yaroslav was tasked with guarding the luggage while his mother and sister went to fetch tea – and that’s when he heard a loud explosion. Natalia recalls seeing her daughter with no legs when she opened her eyes after the strike. “I realized that myself without one limb,” she said. The mother of two still cries from time to time and blames herself for going out to get tea. For Yaroslav, the attack meant shouldering responsibilities far beyond his years. Today, the 11-year-old helps his mother and sister get dressed, brings them food and water and even goes to the store next to the hospital by himself. But the family, who has been in hospital for weeks, finally has something to cheer for – they will soon fly to the US for prosthetic surgery and rehabilitation.

13,Plants grown in moon soil for the first time in history,trends," For the first time in history, scientists have grown plants in soil collected from the Moon -- a critical step forward in space exploration The experiment was jointly conducted by NASA and the University of Florida. Researchers used soil samples collected by Apollo 11, 12, and 17 missions to grow Arabidopsis, which is a relative of mustard greens. For each plant, the team allotted only a gram of lunar soil or regolith. They added water and seeds to the soil samples and left them in terrarium boxes in a clean room,” NASA said in a statement on May 12. A solution had to be added daily to the nutrient-poor soil. After two days, the seeds sprouted, leaving researchers surprised. “I can’t tell you how astonished we were,” Anna-Lisa Paul, a professor of Horticultural Sciences at the University of Florida, said. “Every plant -- whether in a lunar sample or in a control -- looked the same up until about day six.” After day six, it became clear to the researchers that the plants were not as strong as those grown in Earth soil. “The plants grew more slowly and had stunted roots; additionally, some had stunted leaves and sported reddish pigmentation,” NASA said. Nevertheless, the experiment is significant to NASA space exploration goals. ""We’ll need to use resources found on the Moon and Mars to develop food sources for future astronauts living and operating in deep space,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “This fundamental plant growth research is also a key example of how NASA is working to unlock agricultural innovations that could help us understand how plants might overcome stressful conditions in food-scarce areas here on Earth.” Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
14,Storyboard18 x Just Sports | Winning Fans. Spinning Digital Experiences,trends," World over, the draw of sports is compelling. Tennis, football, cricket, baseball, basketball, soccer – we rally around the game that matters to us, in enthusiastic, loyal fandom, and come out in swaths to cheer for our favourite sport stars or teams. This really is a community activity. We begin watching games in our own groups – family, friends, school, local community – and cheer for the team that our group does – the one that we feel most connected to, that feels like home. So, when fans cheer, in many ways they are also celebrating the community that they feel they belong to in addition to those on the court or field. I find this insight fascinating, especially as a brand custodian. Because, like all keepers of brands, my team and I are always seeking ways to create a passionate sense of community around the brand that’s in our charge. That’s why it is only natural that we ask ourselves how we might reach a set of sports fans and have them expand their enthusiasm for their favorite sport to also include Infosys. We puzzled over how we might make them fans of our brand too. That was in the year 2015. The year we first decided to go all out and win the hearts of tennis fans the world over for the Infosys brand. But what could we offer that could capture hearts already captivated by Nadal gliding across the red dirt and playing that odds-defying top-spin pass, or Djokovic’s magic in shrinking the court for his opponents? Our teams found the answer soon enough – what we would do is stretch out these captivating fan-moments with a little help from digital tech. To think like we did, let’s turn the clock back well over a decade to 2009. Andy Roddick and Roger Federer are slugging it out in the fifth set at the Wimbledon finals. In 2022, Wimbledon will have a final set tie-break but back then, until the returner broke the server and established a 2-game lead, the two would remain at loggerheads. It was one of the most fascinating encounters in the history of the sport. The elegance of Roger matched against the raw power of Andy. When Andy finally lost 16-14 in the fifth, he slumped on the bench. The world slumped with him. Tennis fans found themselves unable to disengage. They had invested 4 hours and 17 minutes of their emotions in that battle. They wanted more. They wanted closure that could only come in reliving the story behind the match and reading into the hows, whats and what ifs of that story. But there was no way for them to uncover any of that. No go-to destination to learn more. No 3D views of the court with ball placement patterns that unveiled the player strategy. No Stroke Summary to showcase strengths and weaknesses or Rally Analysis to see who performed better during the long, short and medium length rallies. These are the experience gaps that the Infosys Match Center, with its incredibly thoughtful set of features, fills for tennis fans already having touched 75 million new fans digitally. Soccer and basketball too have upped the game when it comes to digital experiences. Take, for example, the half-time shows during the English Premier League (EPL) where commentators analyze how Mo Salah tiki-takas his way to break down defenses. They use augmented reality and break down lapses in defense formations to study what could have been better. They pause match moments, shift players from their positions to where they could have been all with a quick click. This kind of digital tech speaks to the fondest wishes of fans. The NBA has always been a pioneer when it comes to sports technology. NBA Top Shot is a great example of a digital collectibles marketplace that has taken the industry by storm drawing even non-sports fans to the game. And of course, our very own IPL has seen a tryst with the metaverse with Gujarat Titans making use of the metaverse to unveil their new team logo! Bringing more to more fans, preserving heritage with 3D museums, creating new fanbases through the metaverse and NFTs, and frankly just a whole lot of digital coolness. In so many ways, brands and sports organizations are taking advantage of digital to enrich the sports experience in very human ways. And this is bringing sports closer to fans, and, of course, fans closer to the brands that enable these experiences.  A win-win if there ever was one in the world of competitive sports!

15,Horrifying video shows children falling to ground as waterslide breaks in half,trends," Warning: This article contains disturbing visuals A horrifying video has emerged on social media which shows children at an amusement park in Indonesia falling to the ground as the waterslide they were riding on collapsed. The incident took place last week in Kenjeran park in East Java's Surabaya city, according to The Mirror. The slide at the park broke in half, sending water rushing down and throwing screaming riders on the concrete floor with a thud.  Sixteen children were injured in the incident, according to a report in The Sun. Three of them broke bones. Authorities at the amusement park said the ride had worn out over time but was also overloaded at the time of the accident. The last time they inspected the slide was nine months ago, according to The Sun. Surabaya mayor Eri Cahyadi said that the amusement park will pay for the treatment of those who were injured in the accident . ""The Surabaya City Government will provide trauma-healing assistance to be carried out by the offices to all victims,"" he was quoted as saying by The Sun. ""They are accompanied until full recovery.” Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
16,"Book review: Leaders, Politicians, Citizens | Little known and forgotten stories from the great Indian political theatre",trends," India has a tradition of oral history, but does not have a culture of recording it. Over the years, one has met people who are virtual repositories of anecdotes but few take the trouble of or have the talent for putting pen to paper. As a result, many lesser-known facts about individuals and events that shape the destiny of a nation are lost in the debris of time. Rasheed Kidwai is as much a raconteur as he is a journalist. His latest work – Leaders, Politicians and Citizens – is a valuable addition to this missing genre in contemporary Indian political history. It is a collection of short biographical sketches of 50 politicians and people in public life who have influenced the politics of post-Independence India. In writing, Kidwai has supplemented his own vast bank of knowledge –  accumulated over his long years as a political journalist – with research from published works of well-known historians, journalists and politicians turned authors. Through sharp brushstrokes, the pieces bring to life not just some forgotten personalities but also some untold backstories. Arranged in alphabetical order of names, it starts with a touching piece on Sheikh Abdullah, recounting how his bromance (to use a modern phraseology) with Nehru soured and he died a disillusioned and bitter man discredited before his own people. Related to that is Nehru’s vacillation on the Kashmir plebiscite, Sardar Patel’s willingness to consider swapping Hyderabad for Kashmir (rejected by Pakistani negotiators as an unequal exchange of a province larger than Punjab for some “mountain rocks”). Many of today’s generation would not know and even others would have forgotten Dev Anand’s brief tryst with politics. After the failure of the Janata Party experiment, he launched the National Party of India with luminaries like Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit and Nani Palkhivala, both of whom developed cold feet when it came to contesting elections. He wished to replicate the MGR magic in the rest of India. In the end, it turned out to be “a well-intentioned flop”. Similarly, Dilip Kumar and Vinod Khanna also find place in the memoirs. As expected, Kidwai covers the life and times of noted actors of the great Indian political theatre that has been running for over 70 years and still playing to packed houses. In the case of the big stars - Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee – he reveals some entertaining vignettes that give readers a better understanding of their personalities. But the hidden gems are in the stories of some lost personalities. For examples, how many would still recall Namdeo Dhasal – the controversial, complex and contrarian founder of the Dalit Panther movement, or Abdul Jabbar – the lonely crusader for the victims of Bhopal Gas Tragedy, who died penniless in 2019. Unlike other journalists on the capital beat, Kidwai does not leave out the regional stars. So he has chapters on Jyoti Basu, Jayalalitha, Tarun Gogoi, N.T. Rama Rao, Laldenga and Balasaheb Thackeray with interesting snippets and insights that makes them more accessible to a pan-Indian audience. Then there are interesting cameo actors like Chandraswami, Phoolan Devi and Amar Singh who not only added colour to the scenes but also altered the scripts at times. Just as Indira Gandhi had her inner circle of confidantes (with the likes of Teji Bachchan - whom she lost trust in in her later years), Sonia and Rajiv Gandhi had their Sunday Brunch Club comprising Suman and Manjulika Dubey, Romi Chopra, Arun and Nina Singh, Satish and Sterre Sharma, Ottavio Quattrocchi and a few more. They were the movers and shakers of Lutyens Delhi in the 1980s. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit (Image: Ron Kroon via Wikimedia Commons 3.0) No compendium of such kind can be complete without the inclusion of the ‘power brokers’ through the ages. So, R.K. Dhawan, M.L. Fotedar, Ahmed Patel, Motilal Vohra, Sitaram Kesri have chapters devoted to them. As indeed, to borrow Kidwai’s term, “the Prime Ministers” India never had. They include, Pranab Mukherjee, Rajesh Pilot, Arjun Singh, and Madhav Rao Scindia. A common theme running through the characters is how they did not achieve their potential and died somewhat disillusioned. And whether it is coincidence or destiny that the careers of many were truncated after falling from grace of the members of the dynasty that ruled India for nearly six decades.

17,Elon Musk bats for ‘less divisive’ candidate in 2024 but still supports Trump's Twitter comeback,trends," Tesla boss Elon Musk has said he would reverse the permanent Twitter ban on former United States President Donald Trump if his takeover of the social network goes through. The decision could possibly mean that Donald Trump, who was banned from Twitter in the aftermath of 2021 US Capitol attack, will have a bigger platform to influence the presidential elections of 2024, The Guardian has reported. Elon Musk acknowledged Trump’s divisive politics but stood by his opinion on allowing him back on Twitter. Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter  The Tesla CEO also took a dig at incumbent US President Joe Biden. “Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama,” he said. Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama   Musk, who poised to take over Twitter, has often criticised the platform’s content moderation policies and promised to make it more free. This has led to concerns about increase in instances of online harassment and abuse. The Tesla CEO has also spoken about his ambitious plans of boosting Twitter's revenues and users and eliminating spam bots from the social network Musk is likely to bring new staff members and CEO on board. On Thursday, news broke that two Twitter executives -- Kayvon Beykpour and Bruce Falack -- had been sacked from their positions. Beykpour was told by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal that he wanted to “take the team in a different direction”.

18,Modern Love Mumbai review: The love anthology fatigue worsens,trends," It’s time we start considering the OTT anthology as a sum of its parts rather than vice-versa—disparate showcases of already-established directorial voices without the coalescing synergy of a vibe, an emotion or an idea. After all, the anthology, and the love anthology specifically, has become a safe, commercially viable and attention-grabbing slam-dunk for most streaming platforms. In India, it took off full-throttle during the pandemic when Amazon Prime Video dropped its first Indian original anthology film, Putham Pudhu Kaalai Vidiyaadhaa in Tamil, followed by Unpaused in Hindi. Both of them are post-pandemic productions, a series of stories about, the lack of and the transformative power of human connection amidst the devastating months of the pandemic years. The latest, Modern Love Mumbai, is an adaptation twice removed from its original source. Amazon Prime released its first instalment of an adaptation of New York Times’ popular blog of the same name in 2019—a vapid screen translation of New Yorkers in pursuit of or touched by love and connection. The overall New York worldview that both seasons of the series project is saccharine, straightforward and starry-eyed—the setting, more a luminous canvas in the background rather than a character with its own agency in the human drama. The distinctive stories in both seasons were the ones in which the human vulnerabilities or foibles overshadowed the setting. Amazon India takes the weakest link of the original series, the setting, as the crux of its adaptation of six of the original blog’s stories. So the expectation from this series is for the city to be foil, facilitator and essence in each story. The streaming giant has announced more instalments to follow, where the setting will be other Indian cities, including Hyderabad. The fatigue around anthologies, especially the love anthology, is real. It’s obvious the genre is a convenient way for production houses and streaming platforms to attract big names for less work and less production cost. The names then become hooks for audiences, making the anthology film a showcase rather than a portmanteau in the deeper, heftier sense of being informed by a thematic link. A meal of hors d’oeuvres can be gratifying, and some anthologies are similarly so—like Netflix’s Easy (2016), which is a more authentic and enjoyable dip into modern love than all the different version of the titular series so far. Going back to the pre-streaming era, the anthology and the hyper-linked modern anthology film became a phenomenon among cinephile circles across the world as early as the 1990s when indie slayer of the deadpan bonhomie of subaltern Manhattan, Jim Jarmusch, orchestrated a singular, unifying vibe in two of them: Night on Earth (1991), about five stories each set in Lost Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki, united by nothing else but how nightfall traipses the fate of oddball nocturnal characters in all these cities; and later Coffee and Cigarettes (2003), which recorded in black-and-white and in painstaking detail, famous actors such as Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett playing out a long-suppressed itch or unease through conversations over routine partaking of caffeine and nicotine at a New York café. In the second decade of the 2000, the anthology, a screen equivalent of the short story or micro-fiction, neither short film nor full-length feature, became a genre in itself. The examples are piling up by the year, especially with the streaming boom. Most OTT anthologies leave me unsatisfied with the hors d’oeuvre plate, with more of an appetite for the main course, sometimes, as with the latest, Modern Love Mumbai (released on May 13), even annoyed at not being served a main course. In its basic structure and premise, Modern Love Mumbai is closer to Paris J’taime (2006) - although much smaller in scale and scope. Paris J’taime had 18 films by 20 directors including the Coen Brothers, Gus van Sant,  Olivier Assayas, Tom Tykwer, Alfonso Cuaron and Alexander Payne set in various neighbourhoods of the French capital. It was, as most omnibus films with loose themes tend to be, an erratic, hit-and-miss affair, with Paris serving as a schematic, multi-ethnic backdrop without its physical or historical specificities. In the six stories, roughly 40-45 minutes each, in Modern Love Mumbai, characters navigate the city’s geography and its demands in unsurprising, daily-grind kind of ways. Alankrita Srivastav’s My Beautiful Wrinkles, which has Sarika in the lead role of Dilbar, a middle-aged single librarian struggling to find her sensual mojo, a window overlooking a promenade by the Arabian Sea is the only Mumbai signature; it is more about a woman reconnecting with the world, an earnest, unimaginatively-told antidote to ageism. Tanuja and Pratik Gandhi in Hansal Mehta's 'Baai' - one of six stories in 'Modern Love Mumbai'. Hansal Mehta’s Baai has his politically engaged signature, sympathetic to life on the margins of Indian society: A gay Muslim singer with a soulful, ghazal-inflected voice (Pratik Gandhi), scarred by the Gujarat riots of 2002 while he was a schoolgoing boy, has difficulty accepting his sexuality because he is somewhat toxically honour-bound to his grandmother (baai) played by Tanuja, and by extension, to his family. Dhruv Sehgal’s I Love Thane with Masaba in the lead role is an accent rather than a story on a single landscape artist finding an unlikely match in a man who she meets while on assignment to build a park in Thane. Vishal Bhardwaj’s Mumbai Dragon peeks lovingly into the life of a Chinese immigrant mom whose son is assimilated to life in the entertainment arteries of the city’s suburbs, but falls flat because of performances, working best as an appetising ode to Cantonese cuisine and an unexplored Punjabi-Chinese camaraderie. Shonali Bose’s Raat Rani has a terrific performance by Fatima Sana Shaikh at its core in the lead character of Lali, a Kashmiri immigrant who works as a domestic help in an affluent neighbourhood and finds herself the hard way, after being abandoned in her rickety slum tenement by her husband. Fatima Sana Shaikh in 'Raat Rani'. Cutting Chai, directed by Nupur Asthana, with Arshad Warsi and Chitrangda Singh in roles of the headlining couple, is about the dreary challenges of marriage and domesticity in the city—its treatment as pedestrian as the arc of its story, with a shockingly banal ode to Victoria Terminus thrown in. The last of the anthology, Cutting Chai also makes a pathetic attempt at hyperlinking the stories of the anthology before signing off with an awkward waltz by the Queen’s Necklace. Since it is an anthology, a standout can’t be avoided: Shonali Bose’s Raat Rani is the most engaging because of the way the story, adapted from the source by Nilesh Maniyar, triumphantly weaves the city’s sounds, vistas and provincial niggles and cushions into Lali’s journey of self-discovery. In the lead role of Lali, Shaikh delivers the anthology’s most radiantly immersive performance. The storytelling has the compact density of a good short story, and the cumulative effect is a relaxed and ruminative, yet uplifting buzz in which the city and the character feed off each other. But as a Mumbai film, Modern Love Mumbai is highly ineffective—in most of the stories, the city is a strain or a forced extension, depicted in grindingly clichéd ways.

19,'Disappointed.

Beykpour, Twitter’s head of product, said he had not imagined leaving the company in this manner. “Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction,” he tweeted on May 12. “While I’m disappointed, I take solace in a few things: I am INSANELY proud of what our collective team achieved over the last few years, and my own contribution to this journey.” While I’m disappointed, I take solace in a few things: I am INSANELY proud of what our collective team achieved over the last few years, and my own contribution to this journey.  Falack, general manager of revenue, also confirmed on Twitter that he had been removed by Agrawal but later deleted the tweet.

20,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,trends," Retail inflation rises to 8-year high at 7.8 percent in April Retail inflation surged to 7.79 percent in April, the fastest rise in eight years, led by a surge in food and fuel prices. Food inflation rose by as much as 8.38 percent. The latest inflation number heightened expectations that the Reserve Bank will look at more aggressive interest rate hikes in June to cool prices. Why it’s important: Since persistently high inflation could derail growth, the benchmark interest rate will have to rise. The central bank could now hike the repo rate by 25-40 basis points in its June policy meeting and raise rates by around 75-100 bps in the current financial year to March 31. Soaring inflation sinks equities for fifth day, rupee continues slide India’s stock indices plunged by 2.22 percent, the fifth consecutive day of decline, as concerns over high inflation and heavy selling by foreign portfolio investors roiled markets. The fall in equities was accompanied by a weakening of the rupee, which hit a record low of 77.63 against the dollar. Why it’s important: Bears are tightening their grip over the stock markets and India is no exception. The fear index, or VIX, has shot up 6 percent to tough a seven-week high. It indicates market uncertainty is likely to continue. India’s factory output expands at slow pace of 1.9 percent in March Industrial production grew at a slower pace of 1. 9 percent in March compared to last year, official data showed. The index of industrial production grew 24.2 percent in the year-ago period and 1. 46% in February. Factory output for the entire 2021-22 financial year grew 11.3 percent compared to a shrinkage of 8.4 percent in 2020-21. Why it’s important: Overall industrial output remains weak since the index is only 1 percent above its pre-pandemic level in March 2019. Weak consumption demand is likely to see more headwinds in the coming months from the persistently high inflation. Rainfall could become erratic in the second half of the monsoon season Conflicting atmospheric conditions in the Pacific and Indian Oceans could lead to a normal to above normal rainfall during the first half of the monsoon season, which would be good for sowing the summer crop. However, the second half of the rainy season may get volatile rains that would affect irrigation. Why it’s important: The June to September southwest monsoon is critical for farm output and economic growth as about 60 percent of India’s farms depends on rainfall. The country needs a good cropping season to keep runaway inflation in check. Tatas pick chief of Singapore Airlines’s budget unit to lead Air India Tata Sons named Campbell Wilson, chief executive of Singapore Airlines’ low-fare Scoot arm, to helm Air India after former Turkish Airlines chief Ilker Ayci turned down the role following opposition to his appointment. Why it’s important: Air India was sold to the Tatas in January, after the group emerged as the top bidder in October. The sale ended years of government efforts to privatize the money-losing airline. There are expectations that the flag carrier will now be run more efficiently and eventually become profitable again. India could become top market for Unilever in a decade: CEO India could outstrip the US to become its largest market in a decade, Unilever global chief executive Alan Jope said, even as the fast-moving consumer goods firm warned of unprecedented inflation, rising inequality and the climate change crisis hurting the consumer goods market globally. Why it’s important: The question, Jope said, is when India will become the company’s biggest business and not if. The optimism is against a backdrop of slowing consumer demand in India over the past few quarters. Technology investor SoftBank to pare investments drastically this year Masayoshi Son, founder, and chief executive of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank has said that the group this year will likely invest only half or even a quarter of what it did in 2021. Last year was record-breaking for technology investments amid a never-seen-before funding euphoria across private and public markets. Why it’s important: There is a slowdown expected in big-ticket startup funding which is being led by macroeconomic factors and the ongoing war in Ukraine. This was only to be expected. Byju's in talks to raise $1 billion to fund acquisition plans Byju’s, India’s most valuable startup, is in talks with lenders to raise more than $1 billion in acquisition financing as the online education provider looks to expand its business rapidly. The Bangalore-based firm is in talks with banks, including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co, for the funding to acquire another edtech company. Why it’s important: The Covid-9 pandemic has provided a huge boost to online education and coaching centers. Byju’s has been on a shopping binge in the US and elsewhere and bought out startups offering coding lessons, professional learning courses, and test prep classes for competitive Indian exams. India set to soon overhaul competition law, regulator The central government will likely overhaul the Competition Act in the monsoon session of Parliament starting July and revamp the anti-trust watchdog Competition Commission of India to regulate India’s booming digital economy better. The corporate affairs ministry has prepared already the amendments, which is now being evaluated. Why it’s important: The revamp will consider the disruption caused by the digital economy that was not the case when the competition law was passed two decades ago. The changes may bring mergers and acquisitions of startups with smaller sales and asset bases but with a huge valuation under the legal ambit. Future Retail gets more time to respond to insolvency plea The Mumbai Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal has granted more time to Future Retail to file its reply to the insolvency petition moved by Bank of India against the company under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

21,"Man dials 100 at 2.30 am to ask police for two bottles of beer, booked",trends," A man in Telangana’s Doulatabad allegedly dialed the 100 emergency service faking a threat to his life and then requested the police officers, who rushed to his rescue, to arrange two bottles of beer for him.

Nepali climber Lhakpa Sherpa, 48, reached the snow-capped summit for the 10th time, breaking her own record set in 2018. ""Lhakpa stood atop Everest at 6:15 am today. This has become her 10th ascent,"" Mingma Gelu Sherpa of Seven Summit Adventure, the agency that handled her expedition, told AFP from the Everest base camp. Record-holder Sherpa, who works at Whole Foods in Connecticut for the rest of the year, first scaled the highest mountain in the world in 2001. ""My climbing is not for the record. Many in the young generation follow my footstep. They climb mountains following me. So, I want the young generation to keep going and not to give up,"" Sherpa said in an interview with AFP before leaving for the climb. Thursday's summits came five days after a group of 11 Nepali climbers fixed the rope to set the route for this climbing season. Among them was the Full Circle Everest Expedition, the first all-Black team to summit the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) mountain. ""The first all-Black expedition has made it to Everest.

23,Sarkaru Vaari Paata review: Made for Mahesh Babu fans,trends," Mahesh Babu’s latest outing Sarkaru Vaari Paata was a much-hyped flick that generated a lot of excitement given that it was a big theatrical release in the times of the pandemic. He teams up with director Parasuram, whose Geetha Govindam was a big hit in 2018, essaying the role of Mahesh whose life in the United States revolves around lending money. The director has tried to give Mahesh Babu a fresh new look and supposedly different kind of role in this film, but does he succeed? As the movie begins, we get a glimpse of what young Mahesh’s childhood was like - it was traumatic as his parents died by suicide because they couldn’t pay back a bank loan of Rs 15,000 and this haunts him forever. He moves to the US where he starts moneylending as a business and his motive in the business is not just to lend money but to make sure that people pay back every penny. This is when he meets Kalaavathi (Keerthy Suresh) who, thanks to her gambling addiction, comes to him for a US$10,000 loan. He later discovers that she is the spoilt rich daughter of Rajendranath (Samuthirakani), a corrupt businessman in Visakhapatnam (Vizag), and heads there to recoup his loan.  The movie revolves around money and loans - meagre loans that the middle class struggles to repay and is harassed for by banks while thousands of crores are siphoned off by rich corrupt industrialists who get away with it. The first half of the film takes place in Miami, where Mahi Finance Corporation is based, and we are presented with colourful beautiful scenes and song-and-dance romance sequences between Mahi and Kalaavathi. The 'Kalaavathi' song (already a hit) is a treat to watch. Of course, there are fight sequences thrown in as well to prove that Mahi is not just a pretty boy. And humour, too, in the form of his friend and colleague, Kishore, played by Vennela Kishore. The movie then shifts to Vizag, and this is where it starts to really weigh us down. The constant serious lectures from Mahi about people suffering because of their inability to repay loans and the poorly written confrontation scenes with Rajendranath, a character that we have seen in innumerable films, doesn’t engage the audience. In some of Mahesh Babu’s earlier films, too, he has played the American-returned hero where he comes back to do good for the community and this time round, it is to ‘save’ people like Rajendranath.  Sarkaru Vaari Paata may have touched upon a theme that makes headlines nearly every day, but the execution unfortunately is flawed. Director Parasuram has tried to include all the elements a big star’s fans would want - fights, romance, sappy dialogues like ‘it’s a boy thing’ and a stylish makeover for Mahesh Babu as well. But the writing took a beating in all this. Keerthy Suresh doesn’t have too much to do in the film other than to borrow the initial US$10,000 which sets off the rest of the movie. Samuthirakani’s role is weak as well - he is just a rich man who looks fierce but doesn’t do much otherwise. There are many characters that make brief appearances, like Brahmaji, Ravi Prakash and Ajay, which seem unnecessary to drive home the theme of the film. The music by Thaman and cinematography by Madhi are a plus for the movie. This movie is a complete commercial outing that panders totally to Mahesh Babu fans.

24,Testing AMD's Fidelity FX Super Resolution 2.0,trends," DLSS and FSR, two terms you may have heard of or seen in a graphical options menu of a game you might have played recently and you might have wondered what they do. Deep Learning Super Sampling and Fidelity FX Super Resolution are technologies that use image upscaling to increase performance at higher resolutions. Both implementations vary in their approach, Nvidia's DLSS needs access to Nvidia's GPUs, specifically Nvidia's 20 series GPUs and up, while AMD's solution is more open and works across both GPUs without needing any additional hardware. Released in 2021, AMD's FSR 1.0 delivered some great results across a mix of hardware, both console and PC. Now AMD is ready to release the second edition of FSR and we were lucky enough to get our hands on it, to try it out before launch. How does Fidelity FX Super Resolution 2.0 work? Like FSR 1.0, FSR 2.0 lowers the rendering resolution of a game, increasing performance. Then it scales the image back up again to your target resolution, to maintain a near identical image, similar to what you would get without FSR 2.0 enabled. It uses a technique known as temporal scaling, that uses frame color, depth, and motion vectors in a game rendering pipeline combined with information of past frames to create a high-quality upscaled image at the target resolution. FSR 2.0 is integrated earlier into a game's rendering pipeline and includes an optimized anti-aliasing solution. By comparison, FSR 1.0 used a spatial upscaling algorithm, that is limited to the game's current frame to draw information from to create an upscaled image. It also relied on a game's implementation of anti-aliasing. Okay. So how does this effect my performance? Given the industry trend to move to more demanding graphical options like Raytracing, gaming at higher resolutions requires a lot of power to run smoothly. Image upscaling implementations lower the render resolution to almost half, easing the load on the CPU and GPU. Then using the lower quality image as a template, the image is upscaled back to the original resolution, giving you the performance benefits, in exchange of near identical image quality that you would normally get at that resolution. This makes it much more viable to run demanding games not only on PC's but on consoles as well. Cool. So that means I can run any game at max settings? Not exactly. Image upscaling solutions like FSR 2.0 might not need dedicated hardware, but you will still be limited by the horsepower of your rig. Naturally, high-end graphic cards and CPUs will gain the most but luckily, there are certain presets you can use on mid-range to lower-end systems to increase performance. In the case of FSR 2.0, there are three presets you need to be aware of. Quality mode will scrunch your image down by 67% of your original resolution, which means if your target resolution is 1080p, the image will first be rendered at 720p, before being upscaled back to native resolution or higher. Naturally, this mode is the lowest in terms of hit on image quality, while giving you decent performance gains. Balanced mode, renders a 1080p image at 59% of screen resolution, 1129 x 635, before upscaling it back. As the name implies, this is the ideal compromise between image quality and performance. Performance mode lowers the render resolution down to 50% of the screen resolution, which means a 1080p image is rendered at 540p, before being upscaled back to near native or similar image quality. AMD recommends higher end Radeon RX 5700 graphic cards and above, or Nvidia's RTX 20-series GPUs and above for FSR 2.0's Quality mode. This is meant for higher-end PC's that target 4K resolution. For PC's that are built for 1440p resolutions, AMD recommends Radeon RX Vega Series GPUs, Radeon RX 5600 and above, all the way up to RX 6600, or Nvidia's GTX 1080, RTX 2060 and RTX 3060 for FSR 2.0's Balanced mode. PC's targeting 1080p can use Performance mode with AMD's Radeon RX 590, and Radeon RX 6500XT GPUs or Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1070, or the GeForce GTX 16 Series GPUs. Benchmarks Arkane's Deathloop, which we reviewed last year, will be the first game to make use of AMDs FSR 2.0, and we got to test it to see what difference FSR 2.0 makes in those all important framerates. For the test, we replayed the opening of the game with all settings at the Ultra preset in-game, Vsync turned off and the frame limiter set as high as it would go to 240 fps. The sharpening setting for FSR was set to 10, which is the maximum. We tested with Raytraced Ambient Occlusion and Sun Shadows enabled for one pass, and disabled for the other. We also ran through all modes in FSR 2.0 - Quality, Balanced and Performance. We used the Quality preset in FSR 2.0, when testing at 4K, the Balanced preset when testing at 1440p and Performance preset, when testing at 1080p. Benchmark system CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X processor @ 3.40GHz GPU: AMD Radeon XT 6900 with 16GB of VRAM Memory: Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR 4 RAM @ 2400MHz Motherboard: Asus ProArt X570 Creator WiFi Hard Drive: Kingston 512GB Internal SSD At 4K resolution and using the Quality preset in FSR 2.0 settings, we were able to get an average of 75 fps with Raytraced Sun shadows and Raytraced Quality Ambient Occlusion. Turning off Raytracing, didn't seem to impact performance that match, giving us an average of 77 fps. Using Balanced Mode at a resolution of 1440p, we were able to extract an average fps of 111 with Raytracing options turned on. Turning them off, increased the average to 115 fps. 1080p resolution was tested with FSR 2.0's Performance mode, and with Raytracing turned on, we got an average of 124 fps. With Raytracing off, we recorded an average of 127 fps. As for image quality, the Quality preset looked nearly indistinguishable to our eye, compared to a normally rendered 4K frame. It's impressive how close the upscaled image gets to the target resolution, and you have to zoom in to see the differences. As AMD points out, zoomed in images are not what a gamer will typically see during gameplay. The Balanced preset was also very close to the target of 1440p but there were some differences noticeable compared to a normally rendered 1440p frame, especially around the image edges. During gameplay, it will be hard to tell the difference as you zip around, and you will need to stand still to perceive it. The Performance preset once again performed great, getting really close to the target 1080p resolution but at a noticeable loss in image quality around the borders. It also seemed a smidge less sharp to our eyes. Conclusion Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox, investments, taxes "
