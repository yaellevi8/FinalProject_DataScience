0,Remote WA art gallery welcomes visitors back after two years of COVID isolation,arts-culture,"  A world-renowned art gallery in a small Kimberley community has reopened to the public after a prolonged closure due to the pandemic. Warmun Arts Centre was closed for two years and two months after Aboriginal communities in Western Australia were placed into mandated closure to non-residents. While access was still restricted to Indigenous communities, Warmun's acclaimed art centre was on the outskirts of the community, on a riverbank opposite residents, and would operate under strict COVID protocols. ""It's exciting,"" art centre manager Melissa Callanan said of the May 16 reopening. ""I want to pay a play tribute to the elder group in the community because we had an extraordinarily high vaccination rate, which has ultimately made this possible."" The gallery used the two years of closure to reinvigorate its interior, repainting walls, improving curation skills of locals and showing works through new virtual software. Artists painted from home, with supplies of canvas, brushes and paints dropped off in bundles. Like many remote art centres, it also boosted online sales during the pandemic. ""We've done well in the closure time, we've actually done incredibly well. We've maintained our sales,"" Ms Callanan said. Surprisingly the strong demand from galleries for the centre's more expensive works by Elders and senior artists, which are not usually sold through online methods, also held up. ""In the first year of lockdown we held 28 exhibitions — two in London, one in Berlin plus Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide."" ""Our Elders are extremely well recognised nationally and internationally,"" Ms Callanan said. ""People like Shirley Purdie, she had a major acquisition through the Museum of Contemporary Art and was showing there last year and she had a sell-out exhibition in Sydney. ""And of course, we have Mabel Juli, who we call our rock star and we have constant requests for commissions of her very famous Moon and Star which is at the Museum of Contemporary Art and also held by the National Gallery of Australia."" Ms Callanan said the gallery, owned by the Gija people, had worked hard to maintain profits returning to the community, because external galleries would deduct commissions. ""Last year we thought we have to start to work harder to make more direct sales, because that's better for the community members and better for artists,"" she said. ""A lot of the major art fairs went online last year. That means those sales come to us directly."" Warmun's artists have strong connections to their heritage and country, and have overcome adversity, including when the gallery was rebuilt after floods ripped through in March 2011. The board was keen to welcome visitors back but visitors must follow COVID-19 prevention guidelines, including taking a rapid test, which will be provided free of charge.

1,How growing up in a country town is giving these fashion designers a cutting edge,arts-culture,"  Three fashion designers from regional NSW join sustainability push Cameron Robert McCormick is a household name in Manilla, which, admittedly, is a town of only a few thousand. He is well-known for teaming up with the local leather maker to create heels inspired by Lady Gaga, dressing girls in custom frocks, and using his fashion-forward mother as one of his models. While not necessarily a thriving fashion hub, with just one clothing store which also doubles as a hardware shop, McCormick still found opportunities to express himself and feed his passion. ""I was always interested in fashion and dressing up, like, I really loved book week at school,"" he said. ""There used to be Vogue magazines at the newsagent's and I think they got in one or two a month and I would be one of the ones who bought it,"" he said. The 26-year-old is broadening his reach after launching his eponymous label. He moved back home during the pandemic and has used the opportunity to launch his brand which is centred around made-to-order pieces to ensure accessibility and sustainability. ""The country has given me space,"" he said. ""I have been able to set up a studio here and I am able to focus a lot more of my time into it because I am not travelling the fast-paced rush of Sydney."" His homecoming and the launch of his first line have been made even more special by talented childhood friends and a widower who donated a shed full of fabric. The floral vintage prints in his collection are as authentic as they look. ""It was basically an entire storage shed of fabric because she [the late wife] was a quilter,"" he said. ""She had sadly passed away and he thought I would be the best person to have it so I used a lot of her fabrics in my first collection."" He also enlisted three friends to model, photograph, and provide makeup and a farm location for his collection's first shoot. McCormick's label was woven with the support of his family and his community. ""My biggest fans have kind of been from home you know, they are the ones that have kept tabs on you,"" he said. McCormick isn't alone in the quest to produce high-end fashion sustainably from regional NSW. Meg Wilcher also seized every opportunity to dress up during her school years. Her favourite form of rebellion during her teenage years in Tamworth was the clothes she wore. The 28-year-old Melbourne-based fashion designer would pack an extra pair of clothes on mufti-days to put on once she left the family home. ""I think I have always had this inner rebellious side that just hates feeling trapped or conforming,"" she said. ""There's photos of me when I was five and my favourite outfit was a double belt singlet, mini skirt, leopard print, with multiple butterfly clips in my hair."" Interestingly, the designer did not stick with textiles as a subject despite learning how to sew from her mother who was a textiles teacher. Wilcher put the decision down to creative differences with teachers. But the move was an early display of her unwavering commitment to expressing her authentic self which has helped guide her in the world of fashion. Wilcher's time with major brands exposed her to the realities of mass production and the damaging effect the industry has on the environment, but it also spurred her on to help create change. ""[I was] being slapped in the face with all of these extreme examples of textile waste creating these garments with a huge footprint that wouldn't sell,"" she said. ""I could use my platform and voice to set an example and standards."" Wilcher is working towards what she believes should be the norm, bringing her label, Après Studios, entirely onshore to improve sustainability. But the process has not been easy or cheap, especially when some brands still aren't getting onboard. ""I am forever walking this tightrope but the greater the demand, the greater the supply,"" she said. Wilcher is not only considerate of her impact on the environment, but of the people who want to wear her clothes. ""I have a pretty strong gut feeling towards creating things that fit a purpose to begin with, trying to do it as responsibly as possible, but also in a way that is as inclusive as possible,"" she said. She is now balancing ethical fashion with a new vision for her label too, one that put the spotlight on mental health. ""My brand shift is moving a little more towards dressing for your mood and honouring how you feel and checking in on others."" Elizabeth Murray grew up in Nemingha, just outside of Tamworth, where she learnt to sew at the age of four and went onto complete a highly competitive TAFE fashion course. The young designer said she found her style during the course, but it was her grandmother's flare for fashion that first inspired her. She said her grandmother was ""always wearing matching colours, and matching pinks"". ""We would always get ready for church and my grandma would always dress us up."" The pair explored styles at op shops, but some of the threads they picked up were deemed a little too loud to debut on the main street and were reserved for her grandmother's house. ""The Vinnies in Tamworth was insane, it is one of the best op shops ever,"" she said. Thrifting remains a strong part of her personal mission statement as a way of limiting waste, getting creative and not becoming consumed by the lure of a new outfit for every occasion. ""People need to realise that just having a set wardrobe of a few things is fine, you don't have to have a new outfit every single time,"" she said. Murray is taking a year off after the intensity of finishing her fashion course during the coronavirus pandemic. When her label is ready to launch, she plans for it to be Australian made to create local jobs and to ensure it does its bit to reduce the industry's carbon footprint. But there's one thing she wants consumers to do now to help the cause to tread more lightly on this planet. ""My brand is definitely going to be about things that you can wear over and over again and if you need something to spice it up ... go to the op shop,"" she said.

2,Welcome to 'Haywood': Riverina town embraces 15 minutes of Mad Max fame,arts-culture,"  Mad Max: Furiosa filming drives economic recovery in Hay after COVID-19 and drought With the Mad Max production bandwagon in southern NSW, the host town Hay has received a much-needed economic boost. Hundreds of film crew members have descended on the western Riverina town to film Mad Max: Furiosa. Business owners are reporting an uptick in customers and hotels have been fully booked since March. Hotel manager Amiel Rabbelier said the influx of people into town had been great for business, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. ""You'll notice the cafes and restaurants, they're all getting [a] hit,"" he said. ""Especially on the weekends when a lot of the people that are here working on this film are off and hang around town spending money."" Mr Rabbelier said there was a lot of work on offer as businesses tried to cater to the visitors. ""People are hiring everywhere, we can't get enough staff here,"" he said. The last film in the Mad Max series, Fury Road, was due to be filmed in the state's far west. But, at the time, Broken Hill was too green and production shifted to Namibia, in southern Africa. Film production has since returned to regional NSW and is set to move to Silverton, near Broken Hill, next. Details surrounding Furiosa, which is being directed by George Miller, are shrouded in secrecy and local participants have signed non-disclosure agreements. It is understood the filming in Hay has been mostly for stunt work and the film's main actors, such as Chris Hemsworth, are not expected to visit the town. In the past, Mad Max films have been action-packed features complete with explosions and daring stunts. While technology has come a long way since the original 1979 film starring Mel Gibson, on-location filming is still needed. Cafe manager Megan Griffiths, who has lived in Hay her entire life, said it was the busiest the town had ever been. She said her cafe sold more than 220 coffees in a single day. ""Mornings have got a lot busier than normal. They tend to head out a bit earlier than we would normally start getting busy,"" Ms Griffiths said. Hay Shire Council Mayor Carol Oataway said the agricultural town of about 2,500 people was recovering from more than just a COVID-19 downturn. ""We've just come out of a very long drought and confidence was at an all-time low,"" Ms Oataway said. ""We had businesses shutting their doors in the main street, we had a declining population, school enrolments were declining. ""It's nice to feel that we're coming out of that and we've got some confidence happening in the town."" Hay residents have also enjoyed the 15 minutes of fame filming has brought to the town. Christa Sheaffe said the town felt ""alive again"". ""Unfortunately with COVID it was very quiet. I think people were nervous to get out and about but I feel like there's a real buzz about town again,"" she said. When asked if he would liken Hay to Hollywood, Mr Rabbelier said it was more like ""Haywood"". ""It's definitely got that feel. It's a big thing to be a part of so I think everyone is excited in a way,"" he said.

3,Should your doctor be prescribing art therapy to help your mental health?,arts-culture,"  Could art on prescription be the key to turning around mental ill health? Australia has one of the highest rates of mental ill health in the world. We book in time with our GP for mental health concerns more often than any other ailment. One in four of us will experience an anxiety disorder during our lifetime, and one in 10 will experience depression. The statistics paint a pretty bleak picture, but what if actually painting the picture is part of the solution? Bronwyn has always been skeptical about art therapy. She says it conjures images of privilege and pretension. ""It's a little bit wanky,"" she says, laughing. ""I kind of associate it with hipsters living in the inner city or wealthy white mums who are, like, stressed about their divorce settlement."" Bronwyn has had anxiety for most of her life, and developed PTSD after the sudden death of her brother on flight MH17 in 2014. She says the trauma she experienced means her anxiety is life-long. Even though she has a great psychologist, she was on the lookout for additional strategies to help manage it. ""Anxiety for me is something that's permanent and it's something that ebbs and flows,"" she said. ""There are periods of time when my anxiety is so heightened that talking therapy doesn't cut it, nothing cuts it, so I wanted to try something completely different. ""Also because I had some surface-level judgements about it, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is."" So, she did what she never thought she'd do. She signed on for art as therapy. Bronwyn was one of seven people from very different walks of life who signed on for an experimental program on ABC TV. It's called Space 22, and follows the seven Australians through different creative outlets such as photography, painting and singing to judge what benefits these activities can provide. If successful, the program would add to the growing calls for time engaged in the arts to be part of treatments doctors and other healthcare providers in Australia could prescribe. Space 22 follows seven strangers, each with their own lived experience of mental ill health, as they take part in an ambitious experiment to test if participating in art can help them heal. When Bronwyn walked into the art space with her fellow test subjects, her initial feelings were that of severe discomfort. ""I was really nervous and overwhelmed,"" she said. ""And I was very aware of the fact that I was with a bunch of people that I don't know."" After some initial reservations, the group began to bond over their shared experiences of mental ill health as they were guided through a range of creative outlets. Bronwyn found painting and drawing made the biggest impact on her. ""I realised a big part of it is that the focus is on the process of creating rather than the final product,"" she said. ""I found it so freeing."" Very quickly, Bronwyn found herself turning to drawing to calm her nerves for the day ahead. ""When we'd arrive in the morning, I'd just go straight in and get a piece of paper and pencils or chalk or whatever was there and start doodling until we started,"" she said. ""It was instantly calming for me because it took my focus away from the space and the cameras and the whole thing and just onto what I was doing."" She says the creative outlet is another tool in her arsenal for managing anxiety. ""I've been taught these skills and I now have the resources to, like, self-administer, in a way. ""And by that I mean literally sit down and do a drawing or painting."" Katherine Boydell, a professor of mental health at the Black Dog Institute, oversaw the experiment and says creative activities have a unique effect on the brain and the body. ""There are many studies, a burgeoning literature really, on the relationship between art and mental health and wellbeing,"" Dr Boydell says. ""It's everything from biophysiological studies, like how do your cortisol levels change in response to painting or singing? What about blood pressure, heartbeat? ""There are all sorts of measures that show the arts have an impact on us physically."" She says being engaged in the creative process helps us move past some of the intrusive thoughts and feelings mental ill health can stimulate. ""As you're engaged in the act of creating, it gives the brain an opportunity to shut out the busyness and the unwanted thoughts from anxiety — it's all pushed aside to focus on that outlet,"" she says. But there was another benefit Dr Boydell observed occurring throughout the experiment: a sense of community. ""Watching the cast working together, at least half of the activities involved group work. And so, what you observe happening are these very human connections, these sharing experiences even though [the individuals] are quite different. And so that creates a sense of 'I am not alone'."" There are growing calls for arts to be prescribed as part of a mental health treatment plan by the Australian healthcare system. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada already have similar programs in place, where patients can be referred on to a therapeutic arts service by their doctor. How creative arts are helping empower people living with a mental illness. While Australians may struggle to pick up an arts prescription note from their GP right now, there are plenty of ""wonderful pockets"" across the country holding social groups and building an evidence base, says Dr Boydell. ""There is a lot going on. They are being evaluated and there is research being done on them. But there is no integrated sense of bringing all of these people working in these different pockets together,"" she said. Bronwyn can't see why art as a social prescription wouldn't be embraced by the healthcare system. ""We understand the impact of exercise and movement on wellbeing, we understand the impact of medication and we understand the impact of traditional talking therapy, so why would we not also try and incorporate in creative therapy?""

4,Blockbuster exhibition will explore key influences of British fashion titan Alexander McQueen,arts-culture,"  Alexander McQueen exhibition in Melbourne will celebrate the artist's inspirations using the NGV's collection The first major Australian exhibition of the late British fashion superstar Alexander McQueen will come to Melbourne this summer, almost 13 years since his death in 2010 — and seven after the landmark exhibition Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty broke records at London's Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A), with more than 480,000 tickets sold. Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse will open at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) on December 11, and is a collaboration between that institution and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), where it opened in April. Rather than reattempting a comprehensive, biographical retrospective such as Savage Beauty (which was initiated by the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, where it premiered in 2011), this new exhibition celebrates each museum's extensive holdings of McQueen's work, which include major private bequests. Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse also draws on the permanent collections of LACMA and the NGV to tease out the eclectic inspirations for the designer's work, which ranged from 15th-century religious art to 18th-century Scottish history, cinema, birds and butterflies. The show will span 25 McQueen collections and almost his entire career, from 1994's Banshee (his third collection and second professional runway collection since his now-legendary St Martins graduate show, Jack the Ripper Stalks His Victims) to his final full collection, 2009's shimmering tribute to nature, Plato's Atlantis. The NGV started collecting McQueen in 1996, acquiring works directly from the designer — including pieces from his pivotal Highland Rape collection, where he controversially sent models down the runway in postures of distress and disorientation, wearing torn and stained garments, as a comment on Britain's violence against Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was not the only time McQueen explored his Scottish heritage on the runway, and the NGV exhibition will spotlight another key collection, with 12 looks from 2006's Widows of Culloden, which referenced a brutal 18th-century battle between British forces and Scottish 'rebels', and encapsulated recurring McQueen motifs such as tartan, birds and lace. The NGV iteration of Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse will build on the 60 garments and accessories featured in LACMA's exhibition (drawing on their extensive holdings, the largest in North America) and add nearly 50 additional designs from the NGV collection. The exhibition will take over the ground floor exhibition space of the NGV, where the exhibition Gabrielle Chanel: Fashion Manifesto recently closed. Katie Somerville, senior curator of fashion and textiles for NGV, says fashion nerds will particularly appreciate a set of ""toiles"" ('draft' or prototype versions of dresses) included in the exhibition. Somerville, who was in her first year as an assistant curator in NGV's fashion department when the gallery first acquired McQueen's work, has worked on the exhibition with Danielle Whitfield (curator of fashion and textiles, NGV) and curators from LACMA. She says: ""[McQueen] had a very curious mind; he had an incredible collection of books [and] he was very interested in history. And he very much went out and got into collections and looked at works in storage. Claire Wilcox at the V&A, for instance, had an experience of him accessing things in the collection for that purpose."" Clarissa Esguerra, associate curator of costume and textiles at LACMA, who initiated the exhibition after a major donation of McQueen pieces by Los Angeles-based collector Regina J. Drucker, says that she and her team were almost like detectives in working to identify some of the designer's more obscure references. ""McQueen was an encyclopedic artist, drawing from inspiration from all over the world, different time periods and mediums,"" says Esguerra. In conceiving the exhibition, she says an early ""aha moment"" came when she and her colleagues were looking at a dress from the Scanners collection (2003), which referenced the story of migration from the Arctic tundra of Siberia, through Tibet, into Japan. ""We were looking at the geometric pattern in the fabric, and we were like, 'What is this? What is this pattern? Can we identify it? Does it have significance?' And it does — it is a pattern that's very important to Tibet, because it was used as a Buddhist textile. And that textile motif moved to Japan with Buddhism. ""So [we realised that] he's telling the story of migration and fashion drawing on textile history — and our minds were blown. We were like, 'Oh my God, can we figure this out with other objects?'"" she recalls. She says John Matheson — a collector and archivist of McQueen's work — was also an invaluable consultant on the exhibition, combing through old interviews and show notes. An exhibition like Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse is only possible because of the nature of both LACMA and NGV as 'encyclopedic museums': institutions whose collections span diverse mediums from across the globe and throughout history. At NGV, the exhibition will feature more than 70 artworks and objects from their permanent collection — including photography, paintings, sculpture, antiquities, textiles, and historical fashion — in what should be an intriguing imbrication of art and fashion. Alexander McQueen: Mind, Mythos, Muse will be on display at NGV International, Melbourne, from December 11-April 16. Tops Arts & Culture headlines.

5,'You've got to be invisible at times': Celebrity snapper Robert Rosen on getting the perfect shot ,arts-culture,"  Photographer Robert Rosen snaps celebrities in unguarded moments — often with their permission Over the course of his four-decades long career, Robert Rosen had countless, fleeting, late-night encounters with iconic household names. Retire to the eclectic environs of the RN Drive Drawing Room, for music, musings and unexpected conversations. Often, it would be at a party or nightclub and usually he would be holding a glass of champagne and a pocket camera. The social and fashion photographer snapped the likes of Grace Jones, Nina Simone and David Bowie, often capturing them in unguarded moments. And his secret to getting those remarkable shots? ""You've got to be invisible at times or just blend in,"" Rosen tells ABC RN's The Drawing Room. One of those celebrities — someone whose print recently sold for nearly US$200 million — influenced the direction of his career. ""I met Andy Warhol in 1980 in London. I was invited to a party for him and I watched him doing Polaroids — and I was inspired,"" Rosen recalls. ""After the meeting … I rang Polaroid in London … and said that I wanted to do a collection of autographed Polaroids of famous people."" The photography company sent him a camera and an unlimited amount of its iconic instant film. Since then, he's snapped hundreds of portraits of celebrities at parties and nightclubs, both on Polaroid and regular film. A new survey of his work, Glitterati, is currently on display at Sydney's Powerhouse Museum, and it collects the best images from his lifetime behind the lens. Rosen was often a welcome guest at parties and nightclubs, and the well-known subjects of his photos were happy to pose. While he enjoyed photographing celebrities, he says he also relished capturing affectionate moments between them, something he could only do when he blended in with everyone else. ""I would just put the camera in my pocket, and the security or whoever's on the door just waved me through — which is what happened with the Paul McCartney photo, the kissing photo,"" he says. ""I just love to see people kissing and that affection and warmth [spilling out] into the room. ""If I was talking to someone at a party, I'm always looking over their shoulder. And so, if I see somebody about to kiss, I'll just say to [the person I'm talking to], 'excuse me', and I'll rush over and do the photo, and then go back and continue our conversation."" Rosen grew up in suburban Melbourne, after his family emigrated from South Africa in 1960. After high school, he studied photography at Prahran Technical College but pulled out after a teacher pressured him to take a more commercial approach. He enjoyed capturing interesting characters and so, not wanting to be deterred from his own style, he jumped at the opportunity to move to Kings Cross in Sydney. ""Kings Cross was in the middle of it with the prostitutes on the street, the drag queens in the little nightclubs and stuff like that. And I thought, 'Wow, this is it. I want to be here',"" he says. He also wanted to be a fashion photographer and started off as a freelancer but didn't get much work in Sydney. So in 1975, he moved to London and began traipsing around the city, showing his portfolio to well-known photographers. Getting a foot in the door proved to be harder than he initially thought, and he couldn't afford to get his own studio, so he worked as a barman on the Kings Road. The city's nightlife offered many opportunities. ""I had a wonderful girlfriend who was very social, and we would go out nearly every night to the fashionable restaurants and into the nightclubs like the Embassy Club,"" he says. It was at this venue that he noticed photographers taking pictures of the celebrities who frequented the place. The photographers would sell them to the newspapers the next day. So Rosen decided to try it too. ""I took my little camera and started photographing [the celebrities] and because they knew me, because I was there every night, [they were happy to pose],"" he says. The owner of the club liked his non-intrusive style and soon made him the Embassy Club's official photographer. Here, and at many other London venues, he would snap many of his candid celebrity photographs. Building celebrity connections played a large role in his career, but it wasn't all glitz and glamour. When he was living in London, he'd sometimes attend up to six parties or openings each night. ""My working day would start about 6pm in the evening. I'd go to an art gallery opening or a book launch, or something like that. Then [I'd] go for a dinner at some fabulous restaurant, and then hit the nightclubs until three or four in the morning,"" he recalls. ""Then we'd go for breakfast in Piccadilly in one of those hotels, and then go home and go to bed at about 9am or 10am."" He laughs at the memories. ""I'm still alive. Hell, now I still can't sleep until about 2am."" Rosen went on to work for various fashion magazines, including Vogue Australia. He would often photograph fashion shows with his trademark style. ""That started the fashion career of doing catwalks, doing the London shows and then going to the Paris shows,"" he says. After living in London for some time, he returned home to Australia and began working for Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. But after working for the fashion magazines for 35 years, Rosen retired. He now lives in Bali, a far cry from the hustle and bustle of London. ""It gets a bit tiring, you know, those all-night things and stuff. And I just thought, well, I've done all that I can or all that I want."" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

Getting a foot in the door proved to be harder than he initially thought, and he couldn't afford to get his own studio, so he worked as a barman on the Kings Road. The city's nightlife offered many opportunities. ""I had a wonderful girlfriend who was very social, and we would go out nearly every night to the fashionable restaurants and into the nightclubs like the Embassy Club,"" he says. It was at this venue that he noticed photographers taking pictures of the celebrities who frequented the place. The photographers would sell them to the newspapers the next day. So Rosen decided to try it too. ""I took my little camera and started photographing [the celebrities] and because they knew me, because I was there every night, [they were happy to pose],"" he says. The owner of the club liked his non-intrusive style and soon made him the Embassy Club's official photographer. Here, and at many other London venues, he would snap many of his candid celebrity photographs. Building celebrity connections played a large role in his career, but it wasn't all glitz and glamour. When he was living in London, he'd sometimes attend up to six parties or openings each night. ""My working day would start about 6pm in the evening. I'd go to an art gallery opening or a book launch, or something like that. Then [I'd] go for a dinner at some fabulous restaurant, and then hit the nightclubs until three or four in the morning,"" he recalls. ""Then we'd go for breakfast in Piccadilly in one of those hotels, and then go home and go to bed at about 9am or 10am."" He laughs at the memories. ""I'm still alive. Hell, now I still can't sleep until about 2am."" Rosen went on to work for various fashion magazines, including Vogue Australia. He would often photograph fashion shows with his trademark style. ""That started the fashion career of doing catwalks, doing the London shows and then going to the Paris shows,"" he says. After living in London for some time, he returned home to Australia and began working for Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. But after working for the fashion magazines for 35 years, Rosen retired. He now lives in Bali, a far cry from the hustle and bustle of London. ""It gets a bit tiring, you know, those all-night things and stuff. And I just thought, well, I've done all that I can or all that I want."" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

7,'No questions asked' concession tickets on offer as arts centre strives to make theatre more inclusive,arts-culture,"  New Gippsland Performing Arts Centre promises accessible ticket pricing and inclusive space A new outdoor performing arts and gathering space has officially opened as part of Latrobe City's new $42 million Gippsland Performing Arts Centre precinct. The partly-canopied area, equipped with power, lighting and sound capabilities, was designed to host events such as farmers' markets, kids' and group activities, buskers and roving performers. Another section of the outdoor area channels a relaxed Federation Square set up, complete with beanbags and a big screen. ""Families that have been at the library for story time can come over to enjoy the outdoor precinct here at GPAC as well,"" Latrobe City Mayor Kellie O'Callaghan said. ""We're acutely aware of the connections between the other spaces we have in the creative precinct, and how they intersect with the CBD — it's very much an opportunity for people to gather."" The GPAC complex serves as an upgrade from the old 227-seat Latrobe Performing Arts Centre built in 1972, now known as The Little Theatre. With a 25-metre-high fly tower and stage as big as the Arts Centre in Melbourne, the 750-seat, two-tier, accessible theatre also features a soundproof viewing box. This was designed for theatregoers who are sensitive to light and noise stimulation, have vocal ticks or difficulties remaining still for the duration of a performance. There is also an accessible ticket pricing model. Latrobe City Deputy Mayor  Dan Clancy said the facility would make concession tickets available to anyone in the community experiencing financial challenges. ""There should be no barrier to anyone within our community to access the theatre,"" Cr Clancy said. ""You ring up or you book online, and you say 'I'm after the full price' or 'I'm after the accessible price'. No questions asked."" However, venue accessibility and viability for cash-strapped local artists and performance groups hoping to hire the theatre remains a work in progress. Local theatre director Phillip A Mayer, of the Here There and Everywhere Theatre Company, questioned the viability of building a 750-seat theatre in a town where much of the local patronage is driven by smaller-scale community productions. ""The big space is inaccessible to us, and they've put the prices up at the Little Theatre,"" Mr Mayer said. ""The reality is that we're just going to have to use smaller venues that will do door deals."" With household budgets tightening as the cost of living soars, Mr Mayer believed GPAC would struggle to attract big shows that fill the seats. ""Most people around here will go to Melbourne to see the big shows,"" he said. Cr Clancy insisted council was monitoring the market threshold for GPAC's Corporate, Educational and Community hire rates, and producers were welcome to negotiate with the venue. He suggested groups requiring financial support investigate partnership arrangements with local organisations, or whether their show meets the funding requirements of Creative Victoria and Regional Arts Victoria. In much the same way that Traralgon has become synonymous with world class junior tennis, as a training ground for stars of the future, Latrobe City Council hoped the shire would develop a reputation as a creative industries training hub. ""Tech Connect is a partnership between the Arts Centre Melbourne, which is a Registered Training Organisation for training across Victoria,"" Cr Clancy said. ""Traditionally, people had to go to Box Hill TAFE 20 years ago to get their Certificate II in lighting or sound design, or their riggers ticket. ""Now they can do it through the Arts Centre Melbourne, but they don't have to go to Melbourne, they can come here to Gippsland."" Cr Clancy said The Little Theatre building would serve as a training centre, with technicians, sound designers, set designers and engineers from all across Victoria coming to Gippsland to do their training. ""It's really good for Gippsland, for the technicians who work and live here but also the people who stay extra nights, buy meals and things in the stores here,"" he said. ""It's an economic driver that starts to change the landscape within all of Gippsland, not just here in Latrobe.""

8,"Angela's alpaca fleece weaving doesn't 'follow the rules', and nor does her life",arts-culture,"  Alpaca farmer leaves corporate job for farm life and the art of Japanese Saori weaving West Gippsland's Angela Betheras remembers the day she said, ""Dad, I'd like to be a farmer"". ""Well, you better get a job and earn some money because you're not getting mine,"" her late father John Betheras replied. And so a career in Melbourne beckoned. ""I was a corporate girl. My last role was international supply chain manager for Coles Myer,"" Angela says. She eventually found her way back to the land, near where she spent her childhood on her parents' Charolais cattle property at Labertouche, over an hour east of the city. ""My dad never really let us ride the tractors or things like that,"" she says. Fencing, he said, was ""really boring"". ""I curse him. He's no longer alive, but when I have to fix a fence I go, 'Why didn't you just let me do fencing when I was little?' Then I could fix the damn fence myself,"" Angela says. Angela now runs Nickelby at Darnum, an alpaca farm at Yarragon, almost entirely on her own. She has a little help from Betty, her Massey Ferguson tractor, and a strong network of contractors she has built up over about 15 years. ""They're guys that I can trust because a lot of people want to rip women off on farms,"" she says. The farm fence is by no means where her business ends. A childhood spent mostly on horseback set Angela up for a lifetime of hard work, risk-taking and entrepreneurial thinking. When the ""bottom fell off the beef market"", she remembers her parents warning their children they would need to tighten their belts again. At four years old, she replied: ""If we tighten our belts any further, we're just not going to be able to breathe"". ""My family quote me all the time,"" Angela says. ""I worked in a tin garage selling hot dogs and pies and pasties from grade five right through to second year uni. I never had weekends off."" She had her own business ideas too – one being selling seashells at the beach to her friends, whose parents did not appreciate the clever business idea. Angela now has about 50 alpacas, which provide the fleece for garments she designs and sells in her Yarragon store. She dyes and weaves the fibres herself too, with a lot of washing and drying in between. ""So I think I work for about $5 an hour,"" she says. Fortunately, she finds the alpacas intelligent and easy to farm. ""You don't herd them up, they just follow you like a Pied Piper. They're very intriguing,"" she says. ""People say, you could be earning big bucks in Melbourne, but I go, 'How boring's that?' ""I'm doing something I love. I have no money, but this is how I want to spend my life. ""I don't tend to follow the rules of anything."" This character trait led her to Japan in 2016 to study a design movement that celebrates the free and unique. ""I'm not good at following patterns,"" Angela says. She met the late founder of Saori weaving, Misao Jo, who was 103 years old and did not speak at the time. ""[Misao Jo] took a liking to me. I don't know whether she thought I was funny or whatever, but she kept coming up to me and giving me cuddles,"" she says. The Saori movement started by accident, literally, when Misao Jo created a flawed kimono sash. Her work was rejected, but Misao Jo saw beauty in its human quality. ""It's all about design, there are no mistakes, humans aren't machines, we create,"" Angela says. ""I see it like painting on a loom and every piece being different."" Today, the practice carries on without its founder despite there being only three registered Saori teachers in Australia. Angela employs Saori philosophy in all her work. For example, someone might order a black and white scarf. ""I'll have to say, I'm really sorry, there's a spot of red in there,"" she says. Angela was diagnosed with melanoma in 2018 and undergoes treatment at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne. A central Victorian woman is one of only three accredited teachers of a Japanese form of freestyle weaving that is beginning to grow in popularity. Although she has been highly independent in her career, cancer has taught her to accept more help. ""When I was diagnosed with my cancer, a lot of [contractors] came out and helped me spray and things like that, which was lovely,"" she says. But she makes sure a day trip to Melbourne for treatment is a special event. ""Everyone is working, waiting for their holidays. I don't actually look to go on holidays,"" she says. ""If I took a week off, it would be to go back to Japan … I'd do a crawl around the country going to wool shops — that is my life. Or go and see another alpaca breeder or go and check out some fertiliser."" But she admits, her work style is ""pretty manic"". ""My studio … has fibre all over the floor, threads, bits that I've cut and chopped yarn everywhere,"" she says. ""Sometimes I think I'd just love to be an author and I could sit somewhere in a cafe with a laptop, that would be so nice instead of this mess that I create everywhere.""

10,'The reason you are watching a woman anchor': Leigh Sales pays tribute to 'trailblazer' journalist Caroline Jones,arts-culture,"  Caroline Jones remembered as trailblazing journalist and generous mentor Former ABC journalist Caroline Jones has been remembered as a groundbreaking broadcaster who embraced her role as a mentor to others later in her career. Jones died this week aged 84. Caroline Jones is remembered as a warm and kind person with a wicked sense of humour, but perhaps her biggest legacy is the strides she made for women in media and television. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Jones was the first female reporter on ABC current affairs show This Day Tonight, the first woman to anchor Four Corners, and was associated with Australian Story since its inception in 1996. Current and former journalists from across the ABC and beyond have shared their memories of Jones as a ""generous"" woman who broke a new path for women in Australian media. Former Insiders presenter Barrie Cassidy said was ""one of the first presenters on the ABC with genuine star qualities"". ""So much talent yet so humble and dignified,"" he said. Norman Swan, physician and ABC health broadcaster, said he worked most closely with Jones on Radio National's Search for Meaning program. ""Caroline had moved away from journalism to exploring how we find meaning in life. It was her journey too,"" he said. ""What I saw was a gritty, determined and highly polished broadcaster who knew what she wanted to achieve and did it.  It was what made her very special."" 7.30 host and anchor of the ABC's federal election coverage, Leigh Sales, began the evening with a poignant tribute to Jones. ""The reason you are watching a woman anchor the ABC's federal election coverage tonight is because trailblazers like Caroline Jones did the heavy lifting over decades,"" Sales said. ""Her list of firsts for a female reporter are too lengthy to mention, but along with her journalism, she was a great encourager of her colleagues and we pay tribute to her incredible public service, her grace and her impeccable character."" Many others who she worked with, mentored and inspired took to social media to share their tributes.

11,"The 'bag ladies' who have upcycled donated fabric into nearly 19,000 bags",arts-culture,"  'Bag ladies' upcycle donated fabric into nearly 19,000 bags in fight against plastic. Their charge? Nothing Mary Banks was 33 years old in 1965. A lot was happening back then — the Vietnam War, a dance craze called ""the twist"" and the first polyethylene shopping bag. Hailing from Sweden, single-use plastic bags spread beyond Europe into the United States and eventually Kingston, Mary Banks' seaside hometown on South Australia's Limestone Coast. A cheaper alternative to cloth and paper bags, she remembers their arrival clearly. ""Well, to start with, they were fantastic. We thought it was just wonderful,"" Mary says. ""And now here we are trying to get rid of them."" Now well into retirement, Mary is part of an unexpected, yet devoted, force combating the use of single-use plastics. Kingston SE Small Steps, affectionately known around town as the ""bag ladies"", turn donated materials into hand-sewn recyclable bags. When local Liz Wingard founded the group in October 2019, she thought they'd make a few hundred. Prior to South Australia's single-use plastic ban, one of Kingston's supermarkets was issuing 3,000 plastic bags a week. A large amount for a small community with roughly 2,000 people. ""So our aim was definitely to reduce them,"" Liz says. The group's gone on to make nearly 18,000 shopping bags and 8,500 produce bags out of recycled materials — everything from old curtains to tea towels and duvet covers. ""We have had donations of all sorts of things. And we know that a lot of the material that we get would normally have gone into landfill,"" Liz says. ""We're able to save that and recirculate it, reuse it, and hopefully encourage others to do the same thing."" Meeting at a retirement village every Monday for several hours, it takes five women roughly 15 minutes to make each recycled shopping bag. ""We have people who cut the fabric, someone who stitches the handles, and the next person turns the handles for us. Then we stitch the bags, we overlock bags, we give the bags back. And then they're ready to go,"" Liz says. ""We have a number of girls who take bags home to do work at home [too]."" Starting in the supermarket, the bags are now offered free-of-charge in two-thirds of Kingston's small businesses. As well as making the bags, they offer an amnesty box at both the supermarkets where people can return the bags they've used. ""We encourage people to bring them back … providing the quality is still there,"" Liz says. ""We wash them, re-iron them and put them back into circulation again."" While the environmental impact would be enough to motivate many of the women to take part, it's the social element that keeps them there. Of the women involved in Small Steps, several live alone. For Mary, who lives at the retirement village, the passing of her husband was hard. ""It'll be eight years in October he's been gone. And we did everything together,"" Mary says. ""You just have to get out … there's a variety of people who don't socialise [here] but I think it's a good part of life."" Despite not being a sewer herself, Mary makes herself useful. ""I iron, I turn handles, I make coffee. Not that it's that good a coffee really,"" Mary says. ""It's a lovely group and we have lots of fun. And at the same time we're doing things. ""It would be easy to just sit and do nothing, but I decided that wouldn't help anybody or my family. So I do things."" Mary represents the higher end of the age spectrum. There are some younger women in the group. Having owned her own fabric shop, Clair, from Melbourne, was glad to find the Bag Ladies when she moved to Kingston earlier this year. ""It was interesting at first because as a quilter we deal in precision and [with] the bags we're dealing in quantity,"" Clair says. When homesickness fell, the group made all the difference. ""They've just turned everything upside down and made it lovely, they're wonderful,"" Clair says. ""Having just moved here and knowing nobody, not a soul, Liz has hooked me up with all the clubs and activities, every interest that I mooted. ""I think she's a centre, she's somebody who binds a lot of things together."" These days the bag ladies show no sign of stopping. Far from an exclusive group, their doors are open to any who are interested in joining. ""If there's ever any younger people who would like to learn a skill we have skilled people here that would be more than happy to show you the ropes,"" Liz says. ""They're all a really friendly, giving group of people with practical skills, practical advice.""

12,"When Parkinson’s disease started to affect her makeup artistry, Terri knew she had a job to do",arts-culture,"  Fashion and beauty innovators see opportunities for disability inclusion to cater for 'trillion-dollar' market When Parkinson's disease started preventing makeup artist Terri Bryant from being able to draw the simplest of lines, she knew she had to do something about it. Ms Bryant is part of a growing movement in the fashion and beauty industry, which is developing products for and with people with disability — recognising a virtually untapped trillion-dollar customer market. Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes tremors, balance problems and weakness, including in grip strength. Ms Bryant, who has worked for years as a professional makeup artist, started her accessible business Guide Beauty after she began to struggle using her usual cosmetic instruments. ""What I thought were simple techniques that I used to be able to knock out in 15 minutes … I just couldn't get it quite right. I couldn't get the control,"" she said. The problems she was having inspired her to design cosmetic tools that were suitable for everyone regardless of their level of disability. ""I ran home, and I pulled out my makeup kit and I pulled out my husband's tool kit. And I started prototypes,"" Ms Bryant explained. ""I actually ended up developing the brand because I got Parkinson's [and] when I got my diagnosis, there was something kind of empowering in the moment."" She launched Guide Beauty in 2020 and the business has been a huge success for representing people with disabilities. Ms Bryant tried several styles before choosing tools that were built to a universal design standard so they're comfortable for everyone. The tools are designed to have large grips, facets for resting, and bring the handle closer to the face to make the application stable and easy to use. ""We could kind of help shift the narrative so that people could understand the value of inclusive representation on a design level, because that makes sense from a business perspective,"" she said. ""That makes what is the right thing to do, also a smart business decision. ""The fact the industry has responded so well makes me realise that I don't think we're going to be alone in this space for long. I think people are going to be starting to shift their design process."" Ms Bryant is not the only one to have found their calling. James Parr admits his journey to becoming one of Australia's most sought-after models with a disability had a bumpy start. When he was dignaosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and was told his leg needed to be amputated, he thought it would ruin his life. ""I would say to my friends, 'if the leg goes, I go, I'm not doing it',"" Mr Parr said. ""When it actually came to the surgeon telling me the best option is to amputate, I was like 'cool, let's do it'. And it happened five days later."" Mr Parr was back in the gym 10 days after the surgery and said the amputation gave him a reason to start modelling, to change the narrative that having a disability was a sad outcome. ""I was like, 'I don't align with being sad or I don't align with it as a negative thing,'"" he said. ""It does bring more opportunities … I think part of why I love it and why I get myself out there and I'm so passionate about it, is representation."" He hopes to expand his public image from ""disabled model"" to ""model with a disability"". ""I'm trying to really hone my craft … I am a disabled model, but I want to be a model who has a disability … I just want to change that a bit because it's a bit devaluing."" Mr Parr has been represented by international inclusive talent agency Zebedee Talent and had just walked the 2022 Melbourne fashion week runway with his prosthetic leg in clear view. Launched in 2017, Zebedee Talent represents diverse models, with a focus on talent with disabilities, visible differences and those from the LGBTQIA+ community. Zebedee senior model booker for Australia and America, Victoria Johnson, said the disability modelling industry was a financially important but often overlooked side of the business. ""Disabled people make up 20 per cent of society so it is really important that disabled people are included and visible in such a huge industry, Ms Johnson said. ""It is the ethical right thing to do, and it is also the economically right thing to do. The spending power of disabled people worldwide is $1.2 trillion, so it makes sense for a business to be inclusive."" The fashion industry is worth $27.2 billion in Australia, but what do you do when the fashion industry wasn’t built for you? ""The spending power of disabled people worldwide is 1.2 trillion dollars so it makes sense for a business to be inclusive. ""It is really important for people with disabilities to feel represented and to feel self-worth."" Zebedee was started in the UK by two sisters-in-law both with experience in modelling and disability support. The agency represents some famous talents including British Model Ellie Goldstein, who has down syndrome. Zebedee only launched in Australia last year and already represents 60 talent with over 600 worldwide. According to Ms Johnson and Zebedee junior model booker, Maddie Kalman, Australia is leading the way for disability representation in the industry. ""I think it's really important to be diverse in that way in the fashion industry in Australia,"" Ms Kalman said. ""I think Australia is getting there with diverse and inclusive representation, we still have a long way to go, but we won't stop until 20 per cent of people featured in advertising and fashion are inclusive of people with disabilities. ""But I think it's really important … even if there's not room, let's make room."" Ms Johnson said some of the important international fashion events in Europe, America and the UK did not always make room for models with disabilities. ""We're not sure why they're struggling with inclusivity in fashion shows, to be honest,"" Ms Johnson said. ""It feels like you take a step forward and one or two back, but hopefully we can get to that place again, with our models working in the major places. ""We were really successful at Melbourne fashion week. Most of the shows did include a model with a disability or difference, which was awesome."" In Australia, adaptive clothes are considered assistive technology and can be purchased through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Emma Clegg, occupational therapist and co-founder of adaptive clothing company JAM-the-Label said the NDIS had made it easier for people to purchase high-end accessible clothes. ""The Australian market is quite unique in that we have the NDIS, a lot of other countries don't have a similar funding model,"" Ms Clegg said. ""And so people can actually purchase adaptive clothing through their NDIS plans as low-cost assistive technology because it assists in active dressing and promotes independence and participation in an everyday skill or task."" Ms Clegg and her business partner launched JAM in 2017 to help people like their clients wear comfortable and fashionable clothing that worked better in wheelchairs. Some of the design features include shorter backs on jackets so extra fabric doesn't bunch up between the wearer and the wheelchair, fully zippable sleeves and sides on tops, poncho-style opening on jackets, carry bags and the absence of itchy tags. JAM model Jason Clymo said the NDIS made it easier for him to buy comfortable adaptive clothes instead of mainstream items that caused pressure sores. ""Before I was on the NDIS, I actually didn't even really engage very much with the adaptive fashion industry because I didn't really know much about it,"" Mr Clymo said. ""It was actually through meeting JAM-the-Label that I realised that adaptive fashion was becoming quite a large part of the industry and realising that this was actually a really good option for me."" Ms Kalman said tokenism was still a problem in the industry, with a lot of major brands booking one model with a disability just for publicity. ""They're getting the jobs which is great, but it's like some brands are just ticking a box and they're having like a token disabled person to make themselves look inclusive, but they're not really,"" she said. Mr Clymo, who has represented mainstream modelling agency Wink as well as Zebedee, said he hoped in the future segregation in the fashion industry would vanish. He said having models with and without a disability showcasing the same products would hopefully educate the industry more broadly, and the practice would become mainstream.

15,Fee-for-flattery: WeChat publisher offers candidates a positive spin. But there's a price to be paid,arts-culture," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes A mysterious media agency is behind a fee-for-service offering to federal election candidates, including Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, placement of favourable news articles and interviews on the Chinese-language social media platform WeChat. Australian Financial News (AFN) has published more than 131 advertisements and articles related to the federal election since January, according to researchers from Deakin and Monash universities who are monitoring election material on Chinese social media. Some of this content is presented as news articles written by independent journalists. The ABC has discovered a proposal from AFN for a political candidate that offers, for a fixed price, six weeks of ads, as well as a video and article on WeChat. AFN has helped at least five political campaigns from across the political spectrum advertise to Australia's Chinese-speaking community via WeChat, which boasts more than 1.2 billion active users, many of whom are among the 1.2 million Chinese Australian voters who will cast their ballot on Saturday. Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Labor leader Anthony Albanese, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher, and North Sydney candidates Catherine Renshaw for Labor and independent candidate Kylea Tink, have all been featured in advertisements on AFN's WeChat channel. Mr Frydenberg — who is in a life-or-death struggle in the inner-city Melbourne seat of Kooyong against independent candidate Monique Ryan — has paid for advertisements on AFN's WeChat Channel. It was Mr Frydenberg's campaign that featured most prominently on the AFN channel, with more than a quarter of all AFN election content — including ads, advertorials and commentary — since January 6 containing at least one reference to the Treasurer. When pitching to prospective clients, AFN also sent examples of the WeChat advertisements they had published on behalf of Mr Frydenberg to prospective political clients. ""There are banner advertisements with the Australian Financial News promoting the Morrison government's economic record and plan for a stronger future,"" a spokesperson for Mr Frydenberg said. ""Information on Anthony Albanese's record of supporting higher taxes on Australians has also been featured through banner advertising. WeChat researcher Robbie Fordyce from Monash University also noted there had been a marked increase in the number of advertisements and positive editorial content about Mr Frydenberg from April 2022 onwards. He said ""this level of coverage"" would typically only be available to paid clients. While the Treasurer's office acknowledged that it had placed authorised campaign advertisements on AFN, it denied paying the company to publish flattering editorial coverage. ""There is no payment for articles,"" Frydenberg's spokesperson said. Though AFN has been a prominent player on WeChat during the election campaign, it maintains an elusive business presence. Its listed business address in the Barangaroo precinct of inner Sydney was empty when the ABC visited last week. Its phone number was also no longer connected to the business. Its director, Han Guoliang, was also previously a director of, and shareholder in, Chinese-Australian media outlet Sydney Today. In 2020, AFN apologised for publishing ""false allegations"" about an Australian funds manager. A 2021 AFN press kit, it refers to itself as an ""AFN think tank"" which lists economist and former Labor Party trade minister Craig Emerson as a member. Mr Emerson says he's never heard of AFN. ""I'm unfamiliar with this organisation, and don't have any recollection of having been involved in any of their dealings,"" he told the ABC. ""It appears the description of me is straight from my website."" The press kit also listed a series of companies and Australian government departments as their ""cooperative partners"". The list includes organisations such as business news and data provider Bloomberg, two of Australia's largest consulting firms, PWC and KPMG, and Victorian government agency Invest Victoria. Of those that responded to the ABC, all denied having any current connection with AFN. Invest Victoria said it had ""no record of any relationship or partnership with Australian Financial News"". Fan Yang from Deakin University — who is part of a research group that examined more than 3,200 election-related advertisements and articles on WeChat from 134 public accounts since May 2021 — says companies such as AFN operate as a fee-for-service business while maintaining the appearance of a news organisation. ""They're somewhere between the media and a business,"" she said. The research team found that AFN was one of the most-prolific publishers on WeChat of federal election-related content, and published more advertisements and articles about Mr Frydenberg than any other of the public accounts they monitored. ""In the last week, we have seen several cases with two articles a day from AFN with references to [Mr] Frydenberg,"" said Monash University's Dr Fordyce. Ms Yang and her colleagues also found that, across all 134 WeChat accounts they monitored for election content, 7.7 per cent included some mention of Mr Frydenberg, whether in an article's text or as an advertisement appended to a report. Mr Frydenberg's campaign also appeared to have provided AFN, and another WeChat channel, with original materials that would later appear in effusive articles. Eddie Chan, who runs a Melbourne dry cleaning business, was featured in a video and two articles on WeChat, praising the federal Treasurer. Mr Chan told the ABC the glowing video interview was arranged after he personally offered to help Mr Frydenberg in his re-election efforts. He said Mr Frydenberg arranged for his campaign team to film Mr Chan in his shop. The footage later appeared on AFN's WeChat channel. Mr Chan was happy to appear in the promotional material, saying it reflected his genuine view of Mr Frydenberg. ""Josh puts people together. He has a strong local connection,"" Mr Chan said. Independent candidate for North Sydney Kylea Tink has also run advertisements and an interview article has appeared on WeChat via AFN. Her campaign told the ABC the company provided a tailored proposal for several advertisements, an interview and a translated video that would run over six weeks. The advertisements, video and article were a package deal. In the headline story featuring Ms Tink, AFN wrote that the candidate ""understood the importance of seeking common ground while reserving differences"". ""Participating in public welfare affairs has made her more aware of the current social situation and public sentiment in Australia,"" the article said. At the bottom of the paid interview with Ms Tink, a disclaimer states the article is an ""election promotion"" article. An AFN article published on WeChat about Labor's candidate for North Sydney, Catherine Renshaw, includes the following authorisation: ""The above information is authorised by Bob Nanva of the Australian Labor Party (NSW). Level 9, 377 Sussex Street Sydney NSW 2000."" Under Australian electoral laws, content considered to be ""electoral communications"" typically requires an authorisation to ensure transparency, accountability and traceability. There is no such disclaimer or authorisation in the articles about Mr Frydenberg. Asked about the lack of a proper authorisation, Ms Tink's campaign said they would inform the publisher and ask them to add one. The AEC and Professor Renshaw have been contacted for comment, but neither responded by publication time. AFN's articles about Mr Frydenberg are almost universally flattering and, in some cases, appear lifted from other news outlets. One of the AFN stories, published in mid-February, was titled ""The next Australian Prime Minister is about to be decided?"" It describes Mr Frydenberg's life story, and appears to be paraphrasing positive sections of previous media reporting about the Liberal candidate from other outlets, including The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian. The article claims Prime Minister Scott Morrison was being abandoned by voters for leaving for Hawaii during the Black Summer bushfires and for attending football matches during the pandemic. ""Voters are running away in droves,"" the article said. ""If the Coalition hopes to return to power, it cannot rule out a new leader, and the current treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, would be a favourite."" Inside the Canberra bubble, ""drops"" are a well-known media management tactic used by politicians of all stripes — more often by the government of the day and especially in the run-up to an election. The glowing article then dives into how Mr Frydenberg's love for tennis has shaped him into a capable leader before explaining how his Jewish heritage made the ideal replacement for the country's top job. That story was read more than 25,000 times since it was published, among voters with Chinese backgrounds. AFN did not respond to ABC questions about whether Mr Frydenberg's office had reviewed or approved the articles before publication. However, the story was taken down after being contacted by the ABC. The Treasurer is facing off against independent candidate Monique Ryan in the Victorian electorate of Kooyong where, according to 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), one-in-nine residents report having Chinese ancestry. He has faced backlash from Chinese-Australian voters over the Coalition's anti-China rhetoric. AFN and Labor did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.

16,'A new standard': How this music festival changed to become more inclusive,arts-culture,"  The NT's largest music festival Bass in the Grass improves access for people living with disabilities Darwin's largest music festival, Bass in the Grass, normally draws thousands of tourists to the Top End and this year, Jim Simpson and Jeff McCourt are ready to party. The Northern Territory's largest music festival is making it easier for people with a disability to attend Disability organisations say more work is needed to ensure people of all abilities can access major events Access Arts Australia is working on a minimum code of conduct for events Both men live with cerebral palsy and use wheelchairs. ""This one could be really good … to see the music, to see the festival, to see everything,"" Mr McCourt said. The festival is taking place on Saturday and this year, organisers have made a series of adjustments to accommodate people of all abilities. Changes include shaded viewing platforms in front of stages, an accessible entry lane for ticket holders, free entry for carers and pro-floor matting, which makes it easier for people using wheelchairs to move around. Mr McCourt said it was important for people like him to also enjoy music and other events. ""[It was difficult to attend] some events like the super cars, so it's good [to have these adjustments,"" he said. Mr Simpson went to the event last year and took advantage of the viewing platforms, which allowed him to have an unimpeded view of performers. Using non-verbal communication and with the support of an independent living coach he provided a statement. ""I'm excited about going to the festival and dancing on the viewing platform,"" he said. As for the thing he's most excited about for the Saturday event, Mr McCourt had a surprising answer. ""The food!"" The festival's improved access changes have prompted access advocacy groups to demand more from major events. Annie Rily from disability support organisation, Carpentaria, said the festival's adjustments showed it was possible for festivals to be more inclusive. ""Bass in the Grass is setting a new standard this year and we want to see this continue,"" she said. ""We've got 20,000 people in the Territory that have a disability and we want to ensure that they can fully participate in events,"" she said. The issue extends beyond the Territory's borders; Access Arts Australia CEO Matthew Hall said despite good will, many events were falling short. ""Most music festivals [don't do enough] in terms of accessible toilets and viewing platforms and ramps and quiet zones,"" he said. Ability Fest, which was co-founded by Australian of The Year Dylan Alcott, is regularly pointed to as the blueprint for other major events to follow. Consultation is currently underway to create a minimum code of conduct, which Access Arts Australia hopes will be completed next year. Access2Arts Chief Executive Officer, Rebecca Young, hopes the code will provide organisations with a guide on how they can plan events. However, she said it would also act as a means of holding them to account, if they don't sign up. ""There are the best of intentions out there in the marketplace and across a lot of different arts organisations and festivals, but people not knowing where to start is often the first barrier,"" she said.

17,"Welcome to a new kind of house, packed with features seldom seen before COVID-19",arts-culture," Science ""The Barnaby"" might be a strange name for a home of the future, but that's what this four-bedroom demonstration house claims to be. Located in a small town in North Carolina, it's the size of an average new house in Australia and looks pretty normal from the outside. Inside, the differences are obvious: a front-door ""vestibule"" for no-contact home delivery, two ""pocket"" home offices (neither of which is a bedroom), a school room, a quarantine room, a ""secret room"" behind a bookcase (for being alone), and a whopping four bathrooms. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is a design shaped by the pandemic. The team of architects, social researchers, and marketing experts that dreamed it up say every detail is informed by insights from a survey into the impact of the pandemic on homes and communities in the US. What about in Australia? Here, the property industry is seeing demand for features like those of The Barnaby (though not four bathrooms). The dedicated home office is king, and there's generally greater appreciation for good design and quality of construction. COVID-19 shone a light on all the pre-existing problems with our housing and asked us to do more with our houses, including working from home (WFH). So, what does an ideal post-COVID Australian home look like? And will any actually get built? The Barnaby's design choices were informed by the America at Home study, which surveyed more than 6,000 US adults in 2020. There's a new commercial rush to automate our homes and appliances. Is this how we'll live in the future? It found that Millennials and Gen Xers wanted relatively uncommon features such as germ-resistant countertops and flooring, greater energy efficiency, more storage for food or water, touch-free taps, appliances and toilets, and space for more than one home office. ""Post-pandemic, people have realised their homes can do more and that better design matters,"" said Nancy Keenan, president and chief executive officer of Dahlin Group Architecture Planning, the California-based firm that helped design The Barnaby demonstration house. Key to making a home do more is something called ""the flex space"", or a room with multiple potential uses. What this boils down to is an open-plan living room and kitchen, and then lots of ""acoustically secure"" (ie. decently soundproofed) medium-sized rooms that could be home offices, bedrooms, media rooms, and the like. Along with this, there's a scattering of tiny ""pocket flex spaces"" that could be used as smaller studies or walk-in wardrobes. The idea is that a whole family (The Barnaby was designed for a Millennial couple with two young children, where one parent works from home) can use the one house for lots of different things, all at the same time. ""Providing spaces in the home that can be used in many ways is key to a successful floor plan, especially when designing to smaller square footages,"" Ms Keenan said. ""Our clients are also exploring the viability of optioning flexible furniture systems and moveable walls to enhance space flexibility."" These trends can be seen in Australia. Every two years, property developer Mirvac surveys customers about what they're looking for in a house or an apartment. The most recent survey showed a clear shift in thinking, said Diana Sarcasmo, head of design at Mirvac, which has $26 billion worth of assets under management in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. ""Half the people we spoke to in the survey said they were looking for a hybrid working arrangement going forward,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. That change is reflected in demand for home offices. ""There's been a 20 per cent increase in people in apartments asking for a study. And in housing, there's double the number."" The surge in pet ownership during lockdowns means people are willing to pay extra for doggy doors and dog-wash facilities. And hours spent WFH has made people aware of ""sustainability upgrades"" like thermal insulation. In the short space of one year, Annabelle and Alex have slashed the money they spend on electricity, gas and petrol to zero. Here's how they did it. ""People have always wanted sustainability upgrades, but weren't willing to pay for them,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. ""Now 64 per cent say they're willing to pay extra. That's a massive shift over the last couple of years."" George Massoud, design director at Frasers Property, another large developer, agreed. He's also seen people placing greater value on ""things like quality of light, ventilation, and acoustics"". And the home office with a door you can close is here to stay. ""The mediocre study nook doesn't cut it anymore."" Of course, it's harder finding space for all this in an apartment. Since the onset of COVID-19, house values have out-performed those of units. And dwelling values (houses and units) in regional areas have increased much more than those in capital cities. Eliza Owen, head of research at CoreLogic Australia, said the need for space was a contributing factor. ""Larger, more spacious homes allowed for a home office, and larger properties in regional Australia even allowed people to create their own oasis for entertainment and recreation amid the pandemic,"" she said. So are Australians ditching the inner-city apartment? No, Ms Sarcasmo says. ""There was a feeling during the middle of the pandemic that people would be driven further out of the city,"" she said. ""But in the last several months, what we've seen is great demand for apartment projects, if they're well located with amenities."" Mr Massoud, agreed: the picture was more complicated than Australians buying large houses in regional areas. Size matters, but so does, increasingly, location. People want to live in urban environments that are within walking distance to parks, cafes, pubs, restaurants, and the like. One reason for this may be the rise of WFH: We're taking greater interest in our local community. ""In homes and the apartment space, people are really assessing what's beyond their four walls,"" Mr Massoud said. He also believes homes won't get much bigger. ""I don't see larger homes being a trend, but I do see major improvements in quality."" Though Australia doesn't yet have its own version of The Barnaby , architects are working at imagining how our houses and apartments might be better designed to suit our needs. In March this year, a Brisbane exhibition featured the work of 10 Australian architects who had been invited to develop new concepts of the home and residential environments. The designs included a much greater focus on community and connection, including shared amenities for apartments, as well as verandahs, walkways, and verge gardens to connect neighbours. The exhibition itself was the idea of the Architecture et Cetera Lab, formed by three Griffith University design academics and practising architects, Cecilia Bischeri, Zuzana Kovar and Jessica Blair. ""COVID put what we consider normality under scrutiny,"" Dr Bischeri said. ""Residential space is becoming a habitat, in the sense we are going to function 24/7 in this space. ""Houses need to accommodate all interests and activities that in a normal situation you would experience outside."" Residential architects have seen a big increase in demand for their services, said Shannon Battisson, national president of the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA). In Canberra, where she works, public servants have been spending money on their homes, rather than on overseas holidays. ""One of the big things COVID has done has made people think, 'Hey, we might spend a lot of time here in the future and it's worth doing it well.' ""We went from having a six-month waiting list for our projects, and then that blew out to two years."" What people want isn't the only factor that decides what gets built. Most new apartments, for instance, are built for investors rather than owner-occupiers, says Tom Alves, head of development at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. ""The shape and form of those apartments is not driven by need, but by global investment,"" he said. Houses are similar: Less than 6 per cent of new houses in Australia have architectural involvement. So far, COVID-19 hasn't had a big impact on the regulation determining the minimum standards for houses and units, Dr Alves said. The 2021 update to the Victorian Government's 2017 Better Apartment Design Standards addressed problems with poor acoustic and visual privacy, a lack of natural light, and an inflexible floor plan. Outlining the changes, the Victorian Government website states: ""More than ever, the coronavirus pandemic has shown us that all homes need to have access to air, nature, sunlight and personal space."" Other states and territories have not updated their apartment design standards since the outbreak of COVID-19. The National Construction Code, which sets minimum performance and quality requirements for new housing in Australia, is in the process of being updated to ensure homes are better insulated and energy efficient (though this was set in train well before the pandemic). COVID-19 will change design in Australia, but it may not be as widespread as we might like, Ms Battisson said. ""I think we'll be quick to revert to our usual ways."" But there is one sign of hope, at least in her opinion: fewer people are asking for home theatres. ""We're really against things like home theatres — it's a room that's pretty big and dark and can't be used for anything else. ""In COVID, not a single person asked for a home theatre. ""I'm kind of hoping they won't come back strongly after the pandemic."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

19,'Lead by example': Olivia Newton-John added to honour roll with Tina Arena tribute ,arts-culture,"  Australian Women in Music Awards recognise industry trailblazers at ceremony in Brisbane Dame Olivia Newton-John has joined fellow Australian music legends inducted in the Australian Women in Music Awards Honour Roll, with icon Tina Arena performing a touching tribute celebrating the singer-songwriter. Arena sang Newton-John's global-hit I Honestly Love You, rousing the crowd to a standing ovation as they celebrated both of the music powerhouses at the Australian Women in Music Awards at the Tivoli in Brisbane last night. Newton-John, who accepted the award via video from her home in California, said she was thrilled and grateful to accept the award following after some of her favourite singers — Helen Reddy and Judith Durham. ""I want to encourage everyone to support the work of Australian Women in Music Awards, because diversity is everything,"" she said. ""There are so many talented women who have never thought about going into a certain area of the music industry, not just to sing, as well as producers, engineers, technicians, and there's a whole world waiting for them. ""Once one person does it, others will follow — lead by example, thank you so much."" Following her tribute to Newton-John, Arena spoke of the challenges she has faced throughout her career, saying she had learnt so much about the discrimination in the industry. ""The preying on the vulnerability of artists is something that is really quite pathetic in the day and age in which we live in, so it is our duty to speak up about it. ""But it is also our duty, I feel, to bring change with love."" She presented the inaugural Tina Arena special impact award to Dina Bassile for her work creating disability access at live music and arts events. Bassile thanked her friends, family and ""every single conversation"" with artists with disabilities who have listened to her. ""And people who have listened to me and heard my voice and been willing to make the change to being more inclusive and more accessible to the disability community,"" she said. For championing new opportunities for those often under-represented in music, and for her own talent, disability activist and musician Eliza Hull received the diversity in Music award. Yorta Yorta woman Deborah Cheetham AO was honoured with the Queensland government's lifetime achievement award, for her devotion to the industry as a soprano, composer, educator and leader in the arts for more than 25 years, accepted on her behalf by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. The event, the first held in two years due to the pandemic,  also included artists and music professionals speaking about the significant toll the years of COVID-19 had wreaked on the industry. The room fell silent as ""Little Pattie"" Amphlett spoke about the imbalance of power women face in the industry. AWMA founding executive producer and program director Vicki Gordon created the change maker award, presented by Little Pattie, to recognise the brave women who have fought against bullying, sexual harassment and bad behaviour in the industry. The award was presented to Tamara Georgopoulos, who spoke out about sexual harassment at Sony Music, and independent artist Deena Lynch, who performs as Jaguar Jonze, who spoke about sexual assault publicly, for sharing their stories publicly. The crowd was entertained with musical performances by Sahara Beck, Dizzy Doolan and Barkaa, Emma Donovan & Kee'ahn, Montaigne, and Sandy Evans and Satsuki Odamura. Newcomer Martha Marlow was recognised with the emerging artist award, while the songwriter gong went to Tania Doko. The ceremony at the Tivoli also honoured the many talented women working behind the scenes to make Australia's best music happen. This year Frontier Touring's Sahara Herald received the music leadership award, celebrating her contribution to the industry. The creative leadership award went to musician and festival director and programmer Emily Ulman. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Live creative production award, presented by Brisbane singer-songwriter Katie Noonan, was awarded to Kait Hall, who said it was the first time she had been in front of the lights at the Tivoli. ""It's really quite exceptional to be recognised creatively in the industry, we often get overlooked for these kinds of things, so to have someone understand the importance of what we do to bring your vision as songwriters to the stage is really quite an honour,"" Hall said. ""I'd also like to ask that all of the women that are in this room that get to make the choices about how they will be creatively represented on stage, whether that sound of vision or writing, please consider creating a diverse environment in your crew. ""Very little has changed in the two decades I've been doing this … nearly always, I am the only woman, front of house.""

20,"From fortune-telling machines to risqué pictures, arcade games make a comeback at new museum",arts-culture,"  Arcade games from the past find new future at Craiglie's Penny Parlour museum Simon Rogers has been collecting and restoring penny arcade games for most of his adult life. Now, he has opened what he claims to be Australia's biggest penny arcade museum. The Penny Parlour Museum is located at Craiglie, just outside Port Douglas, and includes fortune-telling machines, amusements, feats of strength and games of skill. ""I first fell in love with penny arcade machines in my youth at the funfairs in England,"" he said. ""I grew up in the north of England and I used to go to all the travelling funfairs. ""I also have a gypsy background, so I also had a lot of friends and family working at the funfairs."" The museum includes machines dating back to 1800s, as well as pinball machines from the 1930s. As most of his machines are more than 70 years old, there are no instructions, manuals or spare parts to be found on the internet, making them harder to restore. ""I first started collecting when I was only 16 and so far I have restored over 70 of them and they are on display here,"" Mr Rogers said. ""I opened the museum to put the restored machines on display as they are made to be played. ""Travelling arcades used to be one of the major forms of entertainment, not everybody could afford to go to the theatre so instead they would go to the penny arcade."" All the machines on display are now operational and they have all been saved from now defunct funfairs that used to travel across Australia. One of the biggest attractions of penny arcades around the early 1900s was the Mutoscope, which works on the same principle as a flip book. Mutoscopes were coin operated, and the customer would view cards through a single lens enclosed by a hood. About 700 cards would be attached to a reel that was driven by a hand crank. Most subjects in the Mutoscopes involved nudity and it was an early precursor to commercial pornography. ""When these Mutoscopes first came out they were considered triple-x, they were quite risqué for the early 1900,"" Mr Rogers said. ""There were lots of protests when these first hit the travelling circuits and they were always made quite tall so that children couldn't see into them. ""They were a big deal because you couldn't access photos of the nude human body back then. ""The travelling arcades and amusement centres had a bit of a seedy reputation anyway, they were the only places that would show these images as nobody else could or would show them."" Mr Rogers' favourite machine is the ""Pussy Shooter"" from 1928, which hasn't been restored but is still in working order. ""You put a penny in, and you get five ball bearings, and you need to knock the cats off the wall and if you get all five cats, your penny is returned,"" he said. ""It was an early version of the shoot-em down duck competition that you now see at the sideshow alley."" Other machines that were popular at penny arcades were the fortune-telling machines that, for a penny, would spit out a card or a photo. ""We have a machine that tells you if you're going to heaven or hell, we also have one that can print out a photo of your future husband or wife and there's a another one that can read your palm,"" Mr Rogers said. ""The fortune-telling machines were sometimes bolted to the front of shops so that people walking out of the shop would spend their change and drop a penny into them. ""The original penny arcades were made for the lower working classes, and they were a big deal when they would come to your town. ""Unfortunately when video machines and home computers came out in the late 1970s, it was the end of the penny arcade.""

21,Arts policy at the election: Who is offering what - and what's at stake?,arts-culture," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The limited discussion of cultural policy in the lead-up to the federal election has left many in the arts sector wondering how the outcome of Saturday's ballot will impact them, as they recover from the devastating losses of the pandemic. With just two days of the campaign left, time has all but run out for the major parties to make any final policy announcements. The focus of the election debate has by and large been on housing affordability and cost-of-living measures, although several peak arts industry bodies and lobby groups have been vocal about the absence of pre-election arts commitments from the two major parties. Labor has, in the final week of the campaign, made a pledge to develop a national cultural policy, while the Coalition has stopped short of making any specific pre-election promises for the arts. The Greens by contrast have put forward a comprehensive plan with detailed arts funding commitments. With the federal election underway it can be hard to keep up with where each party stands on some of the key issues. We've made a little cheat sheet to make it easier. Among the ideas floated are an artist's wage guarantee and a residency program for schools and libraries. But do they hold up to scrutiny? And can the Australian arts afford not to have a comprehensive cultural policy at this critical juncture? Here is a run-down of arts policy pledges by the major parties announced to date. Despite commissioning an inquiry in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on the sector, the Coalition government has not included arts in its policy platform for this election, nor did it take an arts policy to the last election. In a statement to ABC Arts, Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts Paul Fletcher said: ""The Morrison government recognises that the arts sector continues to face challenges unique to the industry, which is why we acted quickly in establishing extensive support throughout the pandemic, totalling $500 million. ""The centrepiece of this support is the $220 million Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (RISE) fund – so far we have provided $200 million to 541 projects, creating more than 213,000 job opportunities across Australia."" Crisis funding allocated to the arts via the government's Creative Economy package lifted arts investment significantly compared to pre-pandemic expenditure. In the last budget, the government committed a further $20 million to the RISE fund but flagged that other initiatives would be wound back — a forecasted contraction of more than 20 per cent by 2025-26, totalling $244.7 million. ""We value the arts as an economic driver — but also, and just as important, for their own sake. A re-elected Morrison government will continue to support the sector in ways that make the arts more accessible to Australians everywhere, and not just for an inner-urban elite,"" the minister said. In the final days of the election campaign, details of how the government intends to support the arts are sparse. When asked if the government will commit additional funding to the arts if re-elected, a spokesperson for the minister said: ""We'll make funding commitments at the appropriate time, just as we have been doing since 2019."" On Monday afternoon, Shadow Minister for the Arts Tony Burke took to the stage at iconic Melbourne live music venue The Espy to announce Labor's commitment to developing a national cultural policy. If elected, Labor will revive its 2013 Creative Australia policy, developed by former prime minister Julia Gillard and then-arts minister Simon Crean. Among its other pledges: Prior to Monday's announcement, Labor had made commitments to reinstate $83.7 million in funding cut from the ABC and lock in five-year funding terms to replace the current triennial terms for both ABC and SBS. Labor has also pledged under its First Nations policy to shore up intellectual property protections for Indigenous artists and to combat the sale of fake art. Burke said in his speech on Monday: ""For nearly a decade there has been no cultural policy guiding the advice of departments or the decisions of ministers. ""Instead we have had a culture war. Attacks on artists as workers. Attacks on the universities and TAFE colleges that train them. And attacks on the institutions including the Australia Council and the ABC which support their work. Our collecting institutions were left to fall into disrepair. ""An Albanese government will restore cultural policy and end the culture war."" At the last election, Labor proposed a comprehensive arts policy, similarly involving a refresh of their 2013 vision, but was criticised for featuring an uncredited stock image by German illustrator MoinMoin on the cover page. Burke acknowledged that the policy needs revision and emphasised that the order of priorities should be re-evaluated. ""[The] concepts are all sound, but I have a firm view that the order needs to reflect the extraordinary cultural strength that is unique to this continent. We have the oldest continuing cultural practices on the planet. ""The first pillar of Australia's cultural policy should be First Nations. First Nations first,"" he said. Labor has already announced funding for a number of arts initiatives, totalling $181.2 million, but Burke did not make any additional pre-election funding promises in his speech. The most comprehensive arts policy proposal in this election campaign has been put forward by the Greens. The party's spokesperson for the arts, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, unveiled the multi-billion-dollar funding initiative earlier this month. The proposal includes the establishment of a $1 billion Live Performance Fund, $1 billion for an Australian Stories Fund, and a multidisciplinary Creativity Commission worth $10 million a year. The Greens also pledged to extend RISE funding ""on an as-needed basis, and [to] fully fund all applications that meet the criteria of the grant funding"". Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. Key policy initiatives: Among the more innovative measures proposed in the plan is an artist's wage pilot program, which would provide $772.60 per week for up to 10,000 established or emerging artists annually. Similar programs have been implemented successfully internationally, including the French artist wage guarantee Intermittence du Spectacle, established in 1936, and the more recently enacted Irish basic income scheme for artists of 325 euros ($487) per week. ""Our Creative Australia policy says that art matters, that it matters to our communities, our economy, and that it should matter to our government and policymakers,"" Hanson-Young said. ""[It] supports the recovery of the arts industry as well as investing in its growth into the future. Our policy would make the arts accessible to everyone, as it should be."" The policy also includes an artist-in-residence program that would see an artist or author placed in registered schools and libraries around the country for one to two days a term. According to Hanson-Young, the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) has costed this program at $14.7 million a year. ""By investing in arts education and creating secure jobs, we will not only ensure a steady pipeline of artists to feed our local creative industries, but we can ensure that choosing the arts as a career is a financially viable option for our young people,"" she said. Hanson-Young confirmed the PBO projects that the total cost of the policy would approach $6 billion over the next decade and said this will be a ""top-order issue for the Greens"" if they hold the balance of power. ""We will push the next government to deliver genuine support and opportunities for the creative sector,"" she said. Of the 1,641 candidates running in this federal election, 90 per cent belong to a political party, 8 per cent are independents and the remaining 2 per cent belong to unaffiliated groups. Of the 130 independent candidates, there are a handful who have made public commitments to advocating for the arts. They include: Independent candidates Jo Dyer worked in the arts for more than 20 years and has proposed five key areas for arts policy improvement, including the development of a National Cultural Policy, a universal basic income scheme for artists, and a 20 per cent content quota for local streaming services, among other initiatives. Dr Sophie Scamps has outlined a seven-point plan for the arts, including greater support for arts education and the role of Indigenous arts and culture, stronger protections for public broadcasters, and also advocates for a national strategy. Allegra Spender is running on three key policy priorities for the arts: bolstering funding for the ABC and SBS, supporting creative industries (including restoring funding to the Australia Council), and rebuilding arts education. Australia has been without a substantive arts policy for nearly a decade. Since the Coalition government was elected under Tony Abbott in 2013, the federal arts portfolio has contracted both in terms of funding and stature. Dr Ben Eltham is a lecturer in cultural and creative industries at Monash University, co-author of Australia Institute’s Creativity in Crisis report (2021) and part of the Fund The Arts campaign. He says there have been a number of stringent cuts to the cultural portfolio under the Coalition, dating back to Joe Hockey's first budget in 2015, which included a $52 million cut to the arts portfolio and stripped $104 million from the Australia Council (80 per cent of which was later reinstated after sector-wide criticism). ""That was a disaster for the governance of the arts sector and did a lot of damage that's taken years to repair,"" Eltham says. ""I also think the ongoing attacks on the ABC across really the entire nine years of the Coalition government are really significant."" Despite the increase to arts funding in response to COVID-19, federal spending over the past decade has been in decline. Analysis by think tank A New Approach concluded that per capita federal arts funding fell by 22.7 per cent between 2007–08 and 2019–20. Eltham says arts funding is low on the government's list of priorities both politically and electorally. Two years of cancellations and hundreds of thousands of lost gigs have had lasting impacts on Australia’s performing arts sector. ""Arts Minister Paul Fletcher is very much running on his record, and he can rightly point to a significant amount of spending in terms of pandemic stimulus for the arts. The RISE program ran to more than $200 million and it's definitely the case that some of that money flowed to artists and was very helpful. ""[But] the last budget before the election wound back most of that stimulus and actually locked in cuts to a lot of the arts portfolio going forward. There's significant austerity coming down the line for the national cultural institutions,"" he says. In the lead-up to the election, peak visual arts and crafts body the National Association for the Visual Arts (NAVA) has been campaigning for stronger policy commitments from across the political spectrum using the slogan #VoteForArts. As part of their campaign, NAVA has produced an election ""report card"" to compare pre-election commitments between the major parties against five key policy priority areas. NAVA's executive director Penelope Benton says one of the most pressing issues for artists in this election is recognition. ""We want recognition that art is a real job: that artists and art is essential, not just for the people who make it or for diehard art lovers but for everybody."" She says the pandemic has had a huge impact on morale in the arts community. ""[Artists] feel really discarded and ignored. Mental health has taken a really big hit because of the [government's] rhetoric around [artists being] non-essential throughout the pandemic."" Because of the arts sector's reliance on casuals, many arts workers were ineligible for government subsidies during the pandemic. Eltham says the highly insecure and precarious nature of arts work — the ""original gig economy"" — has only been exacerbated by the pandemic. ""The most pressing problem in the cultural labour market is that wages are low and in fact falling in real terms. And that's a real crisis not just for the arts but more broadly for the enjoyment of culture from ordinary Australians. ""We're losing a lot of talent and we're also eroding the ability of ordinary Australians to gain access to a rich cultural life,"" he says. The Greens' artist's wage program offers a possible solution to this, but Eltham says its implementation hinges on whether the Greens are able to get the balance of power in the Senate. ""[If they don't], it's hard to see whether they'll have the leverage to get any of this up. But let's assume that they can make it work politically, then potentially, it is transformative."" Pointing to the proposal to double funding for the Australia Council, which would lift their total allocation to $439.6 million a year, Eltham says: ""That would be transformative for the small and medium sector, which is the most creative and the most energetic part of performing arts and small-scale creative sector in Australia."" Are you a dynamic early-career PhD scholars or Arts practitioner, with a flair and passion for communicating your work to a non-academic audience? Benton agrees that the Greens' policy has a lot of potential and aligns with a number of NAVA's priority areas. ""I commend the Greens for putting out this policy. I think it's really great. But there are a lot of really specific things in there that could do with some massaging. ""It's quite weighted to the performing arts sector and [the language] excludes the visual arts. [But] it could be broadened and I'd like to work with them on doing that. I've expressed that to Senator Hanson-Young,"" Benton says. In pledging to develop a national cultural policy, Burke said on Monday afternoon that a Labor government would seek to get the arts sector ""back on track quickly"". Benton says: ""I agree with what the Labor party have said, and I think everybody [in the sector] does, that we don't have another three or four years to be in the state that we're in right now. ""I think the first step is meeting with all the different art forms and talking to them. There's a lot of expertise in the industry already and there's a lot of listening that needs to happen,"" she says. Eltham takes a more critical view of Labor's announcement, saying their 2019 arts policy under Bill Shorten was a stronger pitch. ""I don't see a lot of merit in [this announcement], unfortunately. They've had nine years in opposition and they had a pretty good policy statement last time around. I actually see this as walking back on what was promised three years ago."" He also says that creating a national cultural policy isn't necessarily the best strategy. ""What we need is a big reinvestment in support for the arts and culture. If that's wrapped up with a shiny document and called a policy, then that's fine, but it's more about where the rubber hits the road. ""We've got to imagine the arts and culture in this country for the public good. We've got to invest in this sector, not because of its economic value, which is important, but because of its cultural value — because it's important to ordinary citizens, because it helps them understand what it's like to be an Australian in the year 2022 [and] because it helps us understand who we are as human beings."" While Benton broadly supports Labor's proposal, she has some caveats. ""I think a good critique of the Creative Australia cultural policy is necessary — it's 10 years old and things have changed,"" she says. ""I also think that collaborating, consulting and listening to First Nations practitioners is essential and really needs to be at the core of that work."" Labor has emphasised the need to put First Nations culture at the forefront of arts policy — a suggestion that has been made previously and which Benton and Eltham agree is now long overdue. ""[During the pandemic], there was this realisation that Indigenous art has become the national identity, and that's been recognised in the international arena for some time but has [lagged] domestically,"" says Matthew Everitt, president of Indigenous-led arts advocacy body the Aboriginal Art Association of Australia. Everitt is a proud Taungurung man from the Kulin Nation in Central Victoria and says for there to be greater recognition of Indigenous arts in Australia's cultural life, the development of a national cultural policy should be First Nations-led. ""There are cultural nuances that need to be understood about who gets to tell what stories. The ideation and the road map needs to come from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people — that's critical."" He says a whole-of-government approach and pan-industry consultation are also needed. ""You've got to look at the industry as a tapestry — everything's connected. ""[Consultation] has to be across the whole sector — right through distribution, wholesale retail dealers, arts centres, independent artists: the whole gamut — because they're the ones who are living it,"" he says. Acknowledging the far-reaching impacts of COVID, the government commissioned an inquiry into Australia's creative and cultural industries and institutions — they are due to report back on its 22 recommendations in December. Among the recommendations is the establishment of a National Centre for Indigenous Arts and Culture. ""That idea has been floating around for a long time, in different stages of feasibility. I think it is really important to not only look at what one National Centre of Excellence would look like but what it would look like in individual states,"" says Everitt. In embedding First Nations' arts and culture in policy, Everitt says it's time for governments to transition from a consultation to a co-design process. ""It's important for policymakers to be able to identify and prioritise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander challenges and advancements so … when we're talking about self-determination, economic participation, and social and cultural uplift, it's really important that we have these priorities in place."" While Labor has said they will centre First Nations arts and culture in developing their cultural policy if elected, Eltham says funding commitments are needed to make this pledge meaningful. ""Labor hasn't promised any new funding for the Australia Council, but if [they] wanted to do more funding for First Nations arts and culture, presumably that's where it would have to be done. So I question where that priority is going to actually materialise."" He says there are a lot of other opportunities for investment. ""Funding for Indigenous media for example, as the Greens have promised. Labor's [promise] of support for First Nations languages in schools [is] really positive. But I would like to see funding for First Nations performing arts, First Nations literature, First Nations music."" If the Coalition is re-elected and does not commit further funding to the arts beyond what has been announced in the budget, Eltham says it will return the sector to austerity. ""It'll reimpose fairly stringent funding cuts or at least static funding over the medium term. ""That really means it'll be an underfunded sector, and that's disappointing because things weren't exactly great in 2019 going into the pandemic. Then the sector has faced its worst crisis in 100 years."" Eltham says many parts of the sector, particularly the performing arts, are ""hanging on by their fingernails"". ""They absolutely have not recovered to anything like 2019 levels. So there's a lot of pain in the sector."" Benton says the lack of a strategic vision and robust support for the arts is ""a lost opportunity for the country"". ""The sector will be the shadow of what it should and could be. There'll still be elements of it that exist because people are so passionate about what they do, and will work to make things happen because it's important to us. ""But it's not healthy and it's not sustainable,"" she says. One of the key priorities NAVA has been advocating for during the election is to stimulate long-term sustainability in the arts sector. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. ""We really do need a whole-of-government national cultural plan because [although] the Coalition has given money to the arts throughout the pandemic … it isn't informed by a bigger picture. ""You have these big chunks of money being chucked at one-off things that have an impact in the moment, but then [they're] gone. ""[That approach] doesn't have impact across the broader ecology and that's what we believe a national cultural plan will do,"" she says. Benton says she retains hope that the government, if re-elected, will support the arts beyond what they've announced in the budget. ""Minister Fletcher does actually really like the arts and he does care. ""I think he just needs to listen to the industry that's saying that we need a national cultural plan as recommended by his own inquiry so that there is a strategic and considered approach to investment.""

22,Court told actor who confronted Craig McLachlan about onstage kiss was warned she'd never work in industry again,arts-culture,"  Court told actor who confronted Craig McLachlan about onstage kiss was warned she'd never work in industry again A Sydney court has been told that actor Craig McLachlan threatened a fellow cast member that she would ""never work in the industry again"" after she confronted him about an onstage kiss. Mr McLachlan is suing the ABC, Nine newspapers and actor Christie Whelan Browne for defamation over several reports in 2018 alleging that he had indecently assaulted, bullied, harassed and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 tour of The Rocky Horror Show. The judge in the NSW Supreme Court heard from several witnesses, including actor Brendan Irving, who played the character of Rocky during the tour. Michael Hodge QC — the barrister representing the media organisations and Ms Whelan Browne — quizzed Mr Irving about a 2014 meeting he had with fellow cast member Angela Scundi. The court was told that, during the meeting, Ms Scundi told him she had confronted Mr McLachlan about an onstage kiss, telling him not to do it again, to which he responded: ""You will never work in this industry again."" Mr Irving described the atmosphere on set as ""touchy"" and noted that cast members were often affectionate with each other, which included ""hugging, kissing and sitting on one another's lap"". He told the court of an incident where Ms Whelan Browne shared images of her faeces with other cast members. ""She was going through a phase of taking photos of her poo and showing it to the cast,"" Mr Irving said. ""Her humour wasn't in line with mine."" The court also heard from Mr McLachlan's close friend, Kellie Chandler, who described Mr McLachlan as being ""very fragile"" after reports of the allegations against him were aired in 2018. ""He wouldn't come down from his bedroom and that broke my heart,"" Ms Chandler said. ""He's a shell of his former self. ""He's not the Craig that I know and love."" The case is centred around two reports aired on the ABC's 7.30 program, as well as an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald in January 2018, which the actor has claimed damaged his reputation. Mr McLachlan denies all claims of sexual harassment and bullying that were aired in the reports. During the defamation trial, 11 women are due to give evidence, alleging Mr McLachlan behaved inappropriately during theatre and television productions. About 30 to 40 witnesses are expected to be called during the trial, which is likely to continue for another four weeks.

23,Invention that signals 'we shouldn't be playing this late' saves community's basketball ring,arts-culture,"  Coburg basketball ring gets innovative upgrade after night noise complaints A public basketball hoop in Melbourne's north has been saved by the innovative thinking of a council worker and two industrial design students. The hoop in Coburg's Bush Reserve was removed after police and council received several complaints about the noise of late-night basketballers disrupting residents between 10pm and 2am. ""We want young people to have a good time, but to do it in a way that is a bit more respectful of those living nearby,"" Moreland City Council Mayor Mark Riley said. ""There are other sites where they can go that aren't so close to residents."" After verbal warnings were not enough to keep the late-night noise at bay the hoop was removed in July 2021. Determined to find a way to reinstall the ring, a council worker investigated what existing technology was available to automatically remove the hoop at night and return it during daylight hours. When he couldn't find any workable solutions on the market, he approached a number of Melbourne universities seeking a solution. Monash University industrial design students Marcell Aryananda and Jules Kabore were told about the brief and took up the design challenge. After researching various possible solutions and the cost, the pair came up with a relatively simple and inexpensive design. ""It's essentially a pole that extends out at certain times in the middle of the hoop to stop the ball going through,"" Mr Kabore said. ""But it is also a social cue that we shouldn't be playing this late."" The pole is connected to a circuit board which is programmed to extend the pole at 10pm and retract it at 8am. Mr Aryananda said it was powered by a battery and a solar panel. ""We have an internal clock to support that circuit board, so it knows what time it is,"" he said. The device was installed in early April and has performed well so far. All up the materials cost $1,200. ""I am relieved that it is working,"" Mr Aryananda said. ""The project has been really fulfilling honestly."" Mr Riley says it is a ""win-win"" for everybody. ""The local residents are really pleased with it, but the young ones kind of get it as well,"" he said. Moreland City Council is keen to try out refined versions of the invention at two other sites within the municipality. ""I was really impressed by the students' thinking,"" Mr Riley said. For Mr Aryananda and Mr Kabore, it was also a great opportunity to kickstart their careers. ""As young designers it's quite difficult to enter into the field,"" Mr Kabore said. ""The fact they were willing to help us in every regard and sponsor us through this has been great. ""We are not offered these opportunities very often.""

24,Dress library plans for Beechworth to make the deb ball more accessible for all,arts-culture,"  Dress library plans for Beechworth to make the debutante ball more accessible for all Beechworth's dress library is in its infancy and in less than a week around 75 dresses have been offered up. Old fashioned to some, a rite of passage to others, the debutante ball or ""deb"" remains popular in some regional communities, but price can prove an obstacle for those who want to join in. Josie Cornish, the woman behind the dress library, does not have memories of her own debutante ball. She said her family could not afford a dress, and it was an experience a lot of girls around her at the time shared. ""It would have been wonderful, but money didn't allow it,"" Ms Cornish said. But she remembers her friends who did and attended their ball looking ""absolutely beautiful"". ""It's sad that some people can't go because their parents can't afford the dresses"" Ms Cornish said, which was why she took her idea to start a local dress library to a Facebook Community Page. It quickly became clear that other people felt the same way. Offers of debutant dresses have begun to threaten to overwhelm her. The north-east Victorian town of Beechworth has a perception as quite a wealthy area, but Ms Cornish said many families were struggling. Experience at a local op shop meant she saw firsthand that there were some families scraping to meet day-to-day expenses, let alone the costs associated with a high school formal or debutante ball. There will be not just debutante dresses on offer — formal dresses and men's suits are also being included as they are volunteered. Ms Cornish said the advantage with debutante dresses was that the fashions tended to stay the same. ""The first one I got was seven years old and it's just amazing,"" she said. Ms Cornish's vision has been bolstered by four volunteers who have put up their hands to help operate the mammoth communal wardrobe. Already wrangling dozens of dresses, Ms Cornish said she was hopeful they would be able to offer a bigger range of sizes as more come in. The plan is that ""anyone can donate, and anyone can borrow,"" she said, and they plan to charge a small fee to offset dry cleaning costs. ""It's more a borrow. We're not going to charge too much, and if they can't afford it we'll charge them nothing,"" she said. It is not yet clear when it will be up and running, but ""we'll be ready soon"", she said. The next obstacle is space. ""The only problem is we're looking for somewhere to store them,"" Ms Cornish said.

26,"'Like a giant hug for Ukraine': The grand plan to cover bombed buildings, muddy graveyards in sunflower fabric",arts-culture,"  Like the famous artist Christo, who wrapped some of the world's most iconic landmarks in silk, an Australian artist wants to wrap the bombed buildings and muddy graveyards of Ukraine in fabric. But not just any fabric. It will be a quilt of sunflower patches. ""It's like a giant hug for Ukraine, especially for the children,"" artist Janno McLaughlin said as she sat in her WWII army depot home in Scone, in the NSW Hunter Valley. McLaughlin, who has connections all over the world, said her heart shattered as the news of Russia's invasion reverberated around the globe nearly three months ago. ""Because I had that little connection with those Ukraine kids that I worked with, my mind went straight to them — how are they, where are they, are they OK, are they alive?"" But in a bid to turn something so horrible into a bright burst of hope, she's now on the hunt for about 1,000 quilt patches to form a huge art installation. ""I want it as big as we can get,"" McLaughlin said. ""The more patches we can get the better. She said a creation that would cover ""an acre block"" would send a message. ""They need to feel like the outside world is looking at them and they are not alone,"" she said. She said Ukraine's national flower, the sunflower, was her inspiration. ""There's something about finding a symbol that the people of Ukraine can associate with,"" McLaughlin said. She said the quilt patches also symbolised hope and new growth. ""I envisage that the quilt will be a huge 100m by 100m at least, that people can stand around and hold in an art event,"" McLaughlin said. ""I'd love to drape it from one of those buildings that have been burnt out, or the bombed-out train stations or on one of those awful mass graves."" Fuelled by tea and scones, the local Country Women's Association is also on board. Scone and District president Lyn Tout said the association was all about helping people to offer comfort and support. ""People's wellbeing is so important,"" she said. ""If we can send some little messages of support and love and just embrace Ukraine, that's what the project is all about."" Ms Tout rallied more keen quilters at the recent NSW CWA Conference, where the organisation celebrated its 100th birthday. She said patches were coming from all over the world. ""I'm waiting on some from South Africa, we've had some from Massachusetts, New York, England, church groups, artists everywhere, New Zealand and all over Australia,"" Ms Tout said. On the other side of the world is Iryna Pyrtko-Morozis, the founder of cultural development and charity fund, Sincere Education. She lives in London but has family in Ukraine. She met McLaughlin last year. ""She simply makes an impact every single day. She talks about Ukraine every single day. She unites people in support of Ukraine every day,"" Ms Pyrtko-Morozis said. ""We cannot all go to actually fight in Ukraine, not even be volunteers, but we all can do our own part and that is what brings us closer to each other as humans and brings us closer to the victory of justice, truth and independence."" McLaughlin said it was hard as adults to fully understand what was happening in Ukraine but harder still for young minds. ""The way that they described it at Scone and District preschool was that people in Ukraine were sad and they wanted to do something that was going to lift their spirits, so that's how they explained it to the littlies there,"" she said. ""The Ukrainians really do believe they're going to win this. ""It's not a war they asked for. They're protecting their homeland and protecting their right to freedom. ""When all this horror is done, I can see [the quilt] being laid down … people coming together. Maybe we'll cry, sing … however, we are going to move forward."" McLaughlin and her team are assembling the patches in sections to make travel a little easier. She hopes to get it into the war-torn country by its Independence Day on August 24. ""The main goal is to make it first, then get it to Ukraine somehow,"" she said. ""If worst comes to worst, I'll just get on a plane and take it to London to [Iryna]."" She said what started as a little gesture had grown beyond expectations. Send your 30cm by 30cm patches to: Janno MclaughlinPO Box 746Scone, NSW 2337 ""Art is really powerful … you don't need to speak a language but you can be moved by it,"" she said. ""And in the making of the patches, there's something about it, while you're watching the news … It actually gives the maker a feeling of purpose, of empathy, it feels like you are doing something.

27,NSW Now: Community in shock over stabbing of Hawkesbury Mayor,arts-culture,"  Here's what you need to know this morning. The Deputy Mayor of Hawkesbury Council says the stabbing of the local Mayor during a violent home invasion has left fellow councillors and the community horrified. Patrick Conolly, 32, was stabbed in the arm and threatened by at least five men who forced their way into his Bligh Park home early on Monday morning. His wife and four young children were at home at the time but were not injured. Police believe the attack was a case of mistaken identity. Deputy Mayor Barry Calvert said Mr Conolly was understood to be recovering well after the ordeal. ""If I was him, I'd be in a state of shock,"" he said. ""You're just at home minding your own business and suddenly five or six big fellows come in and start pushing you around. ""It must have been traumatic for the whole family."" The NSW mental health commissioner says improved access to telehealth could be behind a jump in the number of people in regional areas seeking help. The commission's latest COVID-19 wellbeing survey showed the number of regional residents accessing support jumped from 40 per cent in 2020 to 53 per cent in 2021. Commissioner Catherine Lourey said she was surprised to learn how badly the pandemic affected mental health in regional communities last year. She said rural communities felt a stronger sense of connection and resilience during the first wave of the pandemic, but the cumulative effects of drought, fire, flood and the mouse plague might have led to a decline last year. ""That's a real concern for us to really keep top of mind — that especially for some regional communities, there's that sequence of impacts, and that probably contributed as well."" Artist, writer and educator Safdar Ahmed has won the Book of the Year gong at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards for his graphic novel Still Alive: Notes from Australia's Immigration Detention System. Described by the judges as a work of ""vision, ambition and achievement"", Still Alive was awarded Book of the Year  Award ($10,000) and the Multicultural NSW Award ($20,000). ""Ahmed's work stands out as an example of brilliant storytelling created with and through community, a labour of generosity, and love. It is an unflinching critique of policy and discourse that demonstrates the power of art,"" the judges said. Still Alive combines different genres to share the stories of asylum seekers detained in Sydney's Villawood Immigration Detention Centre and in offshore detention on Nauru and Manus Island. Other winners included Tony Birch, who was awarded the Christina Stead Prize for Fiction ($40,000) for his latest short story collection, Dark as Last Night, and Kate Holden, who won the Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction ($40,000) for The Winter Road: A Story of Legacy, Land and a Killing at Croppa Creek. Katherine Brabon won the publicly voted People's Choice Award for her second novel The Shut Ins, which dives into the life of a hikikomori (a person who avoids social contact). Two men have been charged over the assault of a 31-year-old man at Strathfield in Sydney's inner west. Emergency services were called to Strathfield Railway Station after reports of a brawl in the early hours of Sunday morning. A man suffering head injuries was found in a nearby car park on Albert Road and police were told he had been assaulted by up to three men who were seen running towards the railway station. The man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in a serious condition. Late on Sunday, two 18-year-old men were arrested and taken to Auburn Police Station where they were charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company of others. They have been refused bail to appear before Burwood Local Court on Monday May 16. Anti-domestic-violence groups say a Fair Work Commission in-principle decision giving paid leave to millions of workers experiencing domestic and family violence is a ""game changer"". The industrial umpire yesterday announced the provisional decision granting around 2.5 million award workers 10 days of paid leave if they are victims of domestic violence. Whoever wins the federal election will have to decide whether to extend the leave to more than 8 million workers covered by the National Employment Standards. Hayley Foster from Full Stop Australia said it was a ""landmark"" decision. Unions are hoping it will set a precedent for all employed Australians. Sunny.

28,This 10-minute virtual reality experience is designed to counter suicidal thoughts with awe,arts-culture,"  UNSW’s Felt Experience and Empathy Lab combines art and technology to design psychosocial supports for wellbeing Picture entering a room that is like a blank canvas: colourless and bare apart from a door, two windows, and a virtual reality headset. Curiosity compels you to pick up the headset. At first, you see a simulation of the same bare room; the colours, scale, and layout remain unchanged. As you move about the room, you discover you can interact with elements of both your physical and virtual environments — what is known as a 'mixed reality' experience — and these small interactions transform the space. You open a window and the scene beyond morphs into a lofty mountain landscape; a luscious meadow; a sun-soaked beach. Edge of the Present is a 10-minute immersive and sensory installation developed by a team of mental health specialists, artists and technologists from Sydney's Felt Experience and Empathy Lab (fEEL). ""We spent a lot of time thinking about 'What would be awesome and how could you feel it?'"" says Professor Jill Bennett, director of the Big Anxiety Research Centre (BARC) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), which incorporates fEEL. fEEL uses cutting-edge immersive technology to create trauma-informed sensory experiences and tools — ranging from virtual reality installations to live art and performance. ""Art always gives greater freedom [and] that's a significant add-on to what psychotherapy allows. Especially in trauma therapy, because trauma is [an experience that is] hard to express,"" Professor Bennett says. The project was developed in consultation with people with lived experiences of suicide survival, and draws on neuropsychological research on the importance of cultivating imagination and future-thinking in preventing suicide. ""This is a new kind of practice, where we're knitting together distinct expertise to create something new that is built on a long tradition of psychotherapy,"" Professor Bennett says. In creating Edge of the Present, the fEEL team set out to design a sensory experience that would evoke positive mental imagery and a sense of awe. ""Because people with severe depression don't tend to experience awesomeness. In fact, they often have what's referred to as 'overgeneral memory': when they think about themselves in the past or when they think about their future, which uses the same kind of neural pathways, they don't have a lot of emotion attached to that,"" Professor Bennett says. In addition to the eight dynamic landscapes that evolve within the installation, Edge of the Present incorporates sensory stimulants — including a simulated breeze and snow. ""It's hard not to be uplifted by that, and when we test it on people, their mood improves and feelings of hopefulness improve."" Professor Bennett's team at fEEL draws on what is known as psychosocial design to study embodied experiences of mental illness, trauma and aging. ""At the moment, there is great interest in moving beyond just the narrow clinical or medical realm and saying, you know, we need to think of trauma support more broadly,"" she says. Get a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by subscribing to our monthly newsletter In the context of mental health care, psychosocial interventions are broadly understood as therapeutic strategies that are non-pharmacological (i.e.don't rely on medication) and instead focus on improving social and psychological factors that may be contributing to mental ill health. Psychosocial interventions encompass a wide range of strategies, including cognitive and behavioural therapies, group therapy, exercise, skills training, community engagement and creative activities. Through their community consultation and collaborative research, Professor Bennett's team applies a psychosocial lens to designing creative projects that explore trauma and enhance wellbeing. ""[We create] tools and programs that are beneficial to people's mental health — but not just mental health conceived as a chemical imbalance in the brain and an individual thing, but that understands people's interactions, the social determinants of trauma and mental health, and how environments and social relationships can contribute to better mental health,"" says Professor Bennett. In developing Edge of the Present, one of the key psychosocial design considerations was embedding agency in the way participants interact with the space. ""We didn't just want to create this 'blissed out' experience, because with suicidality, the really key thing is that you have a sense of your own agency and that you can make things happen. ""It's this sense of, you do a small action, and there's a reward. You can open doors and windows and that triggers something amazing,"" she says. The title of the project stems from a conversation with one of fEEL's lived experience collaborators, who described the state of suicidality as ""being on the edge of the present"" and unable to see into the future. ""What we're saying is, 'Let's just see what can happen, just try this one tiny thing, and see if you can create some change'."" Professor Bennett says people who haven't experienced suicidality may underestimate the significance of being able to take a small forward action. ""As [someone] in our focus group pointed out, you might be able to experience awe in actual nature and, at a certain point, virtual nature doesn't replace real nature. But the point is that you have to plan a trip, you have to drive there … [with this tool], you open a door and it's not one but eight massive experiences in succession. ""And that's the key thing if you are in major depression or if you're suicidal; to get that instant hit is really important,"" she says. In testing Edge of the Present, Professor Bennett's team conducted a pilot study to assess how participants felt after interacting with the installation, and found that positive mood and wellbeing increased by 16 and 13 per cent respectively, while feelings of hopelessness decreased by 35 per cent. ""There is a significant improvement in mood, and so what we want to do is to try to scale this and see if it can be sustained,"" says Professor Bennett. In Australia, suicide is the leading cause of death among young people. In 2020, deaths by suicide represented just under one in three deaths among people aged 15–17 (31 per cent) and around two in five deaths for people aged 18–24 (39 per cent). ABS data shows that over 90 per cent of people who died by suicide in 2020 reported at least one risk factor, and two-thirds of people experienced both mental and behavioural disorders and psychosocial risk factors. Katherine Boydell is a Professor of Mental Health at the Black Dog Institute and collaborated with fEEL on Edge of the Present, and says there is significant need for these kinds of projects to be scaled up and made more readily available. ""We've just applied for a grant to see if we can make this immersive experience more accessible, so that you don't have to have the actual physical structure of the room — you can just put on a headset,"" she says. Creative and non-pharmacological approaches to addressing mental ill health are becoming increasingly important in Australia, Professor Boydell says — particularly in overcoming some of the barriers to help-seeking associated with more traditional or clinical approaches. Research shows that around one in two Australians experiencing mental ill health do not seek help (although hearteningly, the treatment rate is improving). ""One of the barriers to help-seeking in the formal system has been stigma. And when you think about community resources, [arts-based interventions] are almost like a stealth intervention because it's not focused on mental health — it's focused on doing something else to have an impact on mental health,"" Professor Boydell says. In 2020, the Productivity Commission's mental health inquiry identified ""significant gaps"" in psychosocial support services because of inefficient and short-term funding arrangements, and identified a need to scale up services to make them more accessible. The report found that of the estimated 290,000 Australians who experience severe mental illness, only a quarter currently access psychosocial support measures through government-funded programs. Professor Boydell says this emphasises the need for a ""whole-of-community approach"". ""We have good evidence that engaging in the arts has all of these wonderful positive impacts on overall mental health and wellbeing. ""Especially, when it comes to this 'epidemic of loneliness' … [arts-based] social prescribing programs can really address some of those broader social determinants of health in a more holistic way,"" she says. According to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), mental health is the number one reason Australians visit the GP, and has been for the past five years in a row. The need for expanded support services has only been accelerated by the pandemic, with ABS data from 2020-21 showing that 15 per cent of Australians aged between 16-85 experienced high or very high levels of psychological distress, up from 13 per cent in 2017-18. Young Australians were more than twice as likely as older Australians to experience high or very high levels of psychological distress, with a rate of 20 per cent for people aged 16-34 years compared with 9 per cent for those aged 65-85 years. Professor Bennett echoes the need to develop arts-based psychosocial support measures at scale. ""We're very much concerned with delivering psychosocial benefits. And this is common to approaches that focus on trauma — because trauma, for the most part, is not an illness of the brain; it's something that results from an event or a set of conditions that are traumatising,"" says Professor Bennett. ""Treatment can't just be pharmacological, it has to be looking at how we can change a situation, how we can bolster someone's sense of agency and control, and how we can enable them to develop what's sometimes called resilience."" She says arts interventions and programs are particularly well-placed as psychosocial support strategies. The benefits of creative practice on mental health and wellbeing are widely documented. From treating anxiety and depression to Alzheimer's Disease and post-traumatic stress disorder, there is an overwhelming body of evidence in favour of integrating arts and creativity into mental health care. Last October, RACGP called upon the federal government to invest in a national social prescribing scheme to address the worsening mental health crisis fanned by COVID-19. Professor Boydell says: ""[Social prescribing] is about thinking about informal and community resources that can address health and mental health issues that are more aligned with a 'social determinants of health' approach."" ""So if you've got somebody who's going to a clinic for depression, but they're depressed because they're marginally housed, or they're in debt over their heads, or they're lonely, then you can begin to imagine that no amount of psychosocial interventions or medication is going to address that issue,"" she says. That's where social prescribing can help. Through her work at the Black Dog Institute, Professor Boydell has spent many years researching and evaluating the benefits of arts-on-prescription programs, which are a subset of social prescribing. In Space 22, a six-part documentary series premiering on ABC TV on Tuesday night (May 17), seven Australians with lived experiences of mental ill health take part in an arts-on-prescription experiment. With the support of mental health specialists, including Professor Boydell, participants explore past traumas through a series of creative workshops led by multidisciplinary artist Abdul Abdullah, Archibald-winning visual artist Wendy Sharpe and singer-songwriter Eddie Perfect. Vivienne, a 55-year-old retired medical researcher, is one of the show's participants. She heard about the program through a community centre she is involved with in Sydney's inner west, and says that as a scientist she was excited at the prospect of exploring how art impacts the brain. ""There are feelings inside of me that, even when they come up, are really hard to express in words,"" she says. ""And I thought if I can express them in other ways because, you know, art is a form of expression … maybe that would be really good."" Vivienne has had a long journey with mental health. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), she describes herself as a fighter. ""I started being abused when I was five. My life has been about recovering from that experience."" In her twenties, Vivienne turned to drugs and alcohol as a way to cope. ""I just needed something to soothe me and to take the pain away really,"" she says. ""My whole adult life has been about getting therapy and maintaining my sobriety, but there've been times where I've gone back into that and lost faith in the process. And then I've had to come back out of it again. ""I'm lucky because a lot of people don't make it."" She says she reached a turning point about five years ago, when she turned 50, and is now in a place where she feels ""less attached to the past"". Embarking on the Space 22 project was a transformational experience for Vivienne. She says working with Wendy Sharpe was particularly affecting. ""Wendy really got to the heart of us, you know. She wanted us to paint our feelings. For me, that was the process where my brain actually felt like it switched. Like, almost my thought pattern changed. ""It's just a different way of seeing things and it's really brought out the colours in everything,"" she says. Professor Boydell was recruited to help assess the efficacy of the Space 22 program, and its impact on participants' wellbeing. ""In Space 22, [the participants] are expressing their experiences by using visual and performative and literary means, so it's another way of sharing things that are difficult to put into words and to talk about,"" she says. ""I also think it creates this sense of not being alone, a sense of community, and [a] decrease in isolation or feelings of loneliness… not to mention the capacity to be creative."" Professor Boydell says these connections can be ""transformative"". Having never participated in artistic practice prior to Space 22, Vivienne says that painting is now a part of her life. ""There's such a strong connection between me and the canvas. Like, it's the only thing I can see. It's amazing."" She says putting on music and painting has become a way for her to self-soothe. ""That's why I used to take drugs because I couldn't soothe myself. Post-traumatic stress lives in your central nervous system and it becomes unbearable if left untreated. ""I'm telling you, doing the painting, just watching the colour go on, it's so soothing, which is what we all need. ""And that's the stuff that gets me through the difficult days.""

29,"Graphic novel about refugee experience wins $30,000 and top prize at literary awards",arts-culture,"  Refugee advocate Safdar Ahmed wins Book of the Year with graphic novel Still Alive at NSW Premier's Literary Awards Artist, writer and educator Safdar Ahmed has won Book of the Year at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards on Monday night for his powerful graphic novel Still Alive: Notes from Australia's Immigration Detention System. Described by the judges as a work of ""vision, ambition and achievement"", Still Alive was awarded Book of the Year ($10,000) and the Multicultural NSW Award ($20,000). ""Ahmed's work stands out as an example of brilliant storytelling created with and through community, a labour of generosity, and love. It is an unflinching critique of policy and discourse that demonstrates the power of art,"" the judges said. Still Alive was expanded from Ahmed's 2015 Walkley-winning documentary web-comic, which was made with the assistance of activist organisation GetUp! ""I certainly hope that this makes some contribution towards a sea change in this country in terms of how our government treats people who come to Australia seeking asylum, away from a policy of unconscionably cruel mandatory and indefinite detention and toward something a bit more humane,"" Ahmed said in his acceptance speech. Safdar Ahmed talks about Still Alive: Notes from Australia's Immigration Detention System. Ahmed has lived with the chronic inflammatory condition Crohn's disease for the past 10 years, during which time he has been supported by his mother. ""I think I'll give [the prize money] to her as a small way of thanking her for all the years she's helped me out,"" he told ABC Arts. This year's Christina Stead Prize for Fiction ($40,000) was awarded to Tony Birch for his latest short story collection, Dark as Last Night. Accepting his award at the State Library of NSW ceremony, Birch noted that he got his first library card 60 years ago. ""Without the public library I would not have become a writer. And without the public library many people would never get to access books. These are our institutions that we should treasure,"" he said. Other winners on the night included Kate Holden, who won the Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction ($40,000) for The Winter Road: A Story of Legacy, Land and a Killing at Croppa Creek; and Shaun Grant, who won the Betty Roland Prize for Scriptwriting ($30,000) for his screenplay for Australian film NITRAM. Katherine Brabon won the publicly voted People's Choice Award for her second novel The Shut Ins, which dives into the life of a hikikomori (a person who avoids social contact). Scroll down for full list of award-winners Ahmed's Still Alive combines journalism, memoir, the aesthetic conventions of underground comics and the horror genre to share the stories of asylum seekers detained in Sydney's Villawood Immigration Detention Centre and in offshore detention on Nauru and Manus Island. It also includes a potted history of Australia's refugee policy since the 1990s, under both Labor and Liberal governments. His book was written over six years but is the culmination of 10 years of volunteering with the Refugee Art Project, a community art organisation that Ahmed co-founded in 2010. The not-for-profit invites refugees to tell their own stories through drawing and painting, with some of the work going on to feature in exhibitions, journals and 'zines. ""In a restrictive environment like Villawood where, at the time, there were no cameras and no mobile phones with recording capability, [and] no journalists allowed to go in there, [making art] felt like the best way to record what was going on,"" Ahmed says. Still Alive also examines how art can be healing and cathartic, and give people a sense of agency. ""Art and storytelling allow trauma to be visualised, externalised, and re-embedded in its context, which provides greater feelings of safety and distance from it over time. In this sense art can help us process our experiences on some level to provide a new sense of control over our story and how it should be told,"" Ahmed writes. Writing Still Alive, Ahmed wrestled with whether he should insert himself into the narrative. Initially, he says, he thought, ""No, this book isn't about me. And the narrative and the emotional gist of it should be conveyed very strongly through other people's narratives."" But he soon realised that he needed to depict himself as well. ""Refugee Art Project was about using art to form community and to enable friendships and to help people process things in their own way and on their own terms,"" he explains. ""It would have been a bit dishonest for me not to talk about that as well, because I feel like art has done that for myself."" Ahmed writes in Still Alive about how art was a useful tool for processing his emotions when he lived with chronic depression: ""Art has helped me understand something about my relationship to the world."" He was inspired to create Still Alive by the graphic journalism of Maltese American cartoonist Joe Sacco (Palestine), which engages critically with the subjectivity of its author. ""That self-reflective element allowed me to ask broader questions about my own attitudes, my role in that environment [and] how refugees are perceived, [in order] to deal with those broader discourses,"" he says. In Still Alive, he writes: ""I find it hard to draw myself into this comic … it tackles life and death issues, which are bigger than my solipsistic art. Through the lottery of birth I've had a life of privilege, so I might not be the best person to record these stories. But as an Australian citizen aren't I implicated in the abuses of my government?"" He addresses ethical concerns about telling vulnerable people's stories by reproducing the work of refugees in detention, from the Refugee Art Project, with their permission and input. ""I felt very fortunate and privileged to be given the responsibility of sharing other people's stories and trying to create some representation of what people were telling me about their experiences of being in detention indefinitely,"" he says. Still Alive is the second graphic novel to win Book of the Year at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards, after Shaun Tan won in 2007 for The Arrival. While graphic novels are popular in countries such as Japan, France and the United States, interest in the form has also increased in Australia over the past 15 years — with independent publishers such as Twelve Panels Press, which published Still Alive, showcasing the work of Australian creatives. ""The market is always growing in the sense that, I think, graphic novels are becoming more appreciated, particularly by young people,"" Ahmed explains. He loves graphic novels because they bring together his interests in visual art and writing. ""I like to think of it as combining the logical, rational side of my brain, which is interested in telling stories and explaining causes and effects, with the intuitive, mystical side of me, which is more drawn to imagery and evocative visuals,"" he says. As a form, graphic novels are also uniquely suited to telling stories that are intended to spark change. Ahmed explains that cartooning has its origins in political protest and mocking people with power and privilege. ""For me, the power of graphic novels is that they belong in a tradition of subversive art … I see it as a form which is very well-tailored to creating work which is complex and rich, but also very critical."" Ahmed says he always hoped the book would find its way into the hands of young people and, since it was published, he has heard from many educators — including teachers and librarians — about Still Alive reaching that audience. ""I wanted young people to be educated and inspired by it,"" he says. ""I think young people care a lot more about the issues that actually matter, like climate change and human rights … I see change coming [from young people]."" This year's NSW Premier's Literary Awards has acknowledged another often-overlooked form: the short story. The last time a short story collection won the Christina Stead Prize for Fiction was in 2005 (Tim Winton's The Turning). To see short stories attract this level of attention is particularly validating for author, activist and historian Tony Birch, who has devoted much of his career to the form. While one of his major successes was a novel, The White Girl (which won the Indigenous Writers' Award at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards in 2020), he has published five short story collections, including Dark as Last Night. ""It's very rare that a short story collection wins a fiction prize when it's in the same category as novels,"" Birch says. ""I really love writing short fiction, so to have a short story collection win a general fiction prize, I really am very happy about that."" Dark as Last Night is a collection of 16 vivid short stories about ""people on the margins"". The stories traverse childhood experiences and family connections, as well as issues of domestic abuse, racism and grief. One describes a brother and sister packing up their late brother's housing commission flat. In another, a boy teaches his little brother how to ride a bike before he defends him against a gang of thieves. In another, teenagers in '70s Melbourne connect over the music of David Bowie. The collection was described by the award judges as ""captivating"": ""[The stories] rub at the seams and scars of contemporary life and carry us, along with their flawed but ultimately lovable characters, into bright hope, humour and appreciation."" For Birch, it takes more concentration to write a short story collection than a novel, as it involves inhabiting many different characters, as well as crafting the stories into a cohesive whole. ""One of the things I'd probably rally against is some people thinking the reason why short story collections tend not to win major prizes is that they're easier to write or it's not the same accomplishment as a novel,"" Birch says. ""I don't think it's harder or easier work, it's just a different form — and I think people should stop seeing short stories as an apprenticeship to move on to a novel,"" he says. Birch's younger brother, Wayne, died suddenly three years ago. Three stories in the collection are dedicated to him and draw upon Birch's experience of loss. Readers who have identified with his writing about grief approached him at writers' festivals to talk about their own experiences. ""I'm quite happy, obviously, for people to interpret the story any way they like and [to] relate it to any experience they like, as long as I feel that I've made a connection with a reader,"" he says. ""For me, that's the only reason to write: to make a connection with readers.""

The First Nations Fashion + Design (FNFD) closing runway highlighted designers from right across Australia. FNFD celebrates independent Indigenous designers and supports their growth and development in the fashion industry. Supported by THE ICONIC, First Nations Fashion + Design wowed a packed crowd on Friday night, with female musicians and a primarily female line-up of designers as a way to explore the matriarchal structure of First Nations' culture. And while the event marked the end of a week in which fashion was front and centre, it's also a new beginning for First Nations fashion. For Sydneysiders, Election Day this Saturday, May 21, will also mark the official opening of the Edit Collection and First Nations Fashion + Design pop-up store in Chatswood on Sydney's Lower North Shore. It will be open for a month. Available will be the designs on display at Friday's show. The theme of the night was Our Island, Our Home – a campaign by Torres Strait Islander people to raise awareness about climate change. Christine Anu and Zipporah Corser-Anu, The Merindas and rapper BARKAA performed to a hyped audience. It was one of those rare events in these pandemic times in that it attracted a very large crowd. And there didn't seem to be a single person in the audience who didn't think this was an event worth attending and a fitting conclusion to Fashion Week 2022.

31,"'It's the vibe!': Land clearing case won, despite legal argument likened to The Castle's Dennis Denuto",arts-culture,"  Judge cites The Castle's Dennis Denuto in win for environmentalists against Liberal politician John Tucker's bid to clear land Tasmania's Supreme Court has blocked a state government MP from clearing a huge tract of land on his farm after a seven-year court battle waged by environmentalists. Despite likening part of their legal argument to that put by bumbling fictional lawyer Dennis Denuto in The Castle, Justice Stephen Estcourt has ruled in favour of the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, which had applied to stop Lyons Liberal MP John Tucker from clearing 1,800 hectares of native forest at his Ansons Bay farm. Dennis Denuto, played by Tiriel Mora, is the lawyer to protagonist Darryl Kerrigan in his bid to save his home in the 1997 Australian movie The Castle. Denuto famously argued ""it's the constitution, it's Mabo, it's justice, it's law, it's the vibe… I rest my case."" In the film, Denuto loses the case — which is later taken up, and won, by a retired Queen's Counsel with extensive experience in constitutional law. Tasmanian Conservation Trust chief executive Peter McGlone welcomed the Supreme Court decision. ""This is a fantastic outcome that has saved 1,800 hectares of native forest including habitat for numerous threatened species, including the Tasmanian devil, tiger quoll and New Holland mouse, and 491 hectares of critically endangered eucalyptus ovata forest,"" Mr McGlone said. Mr Tucker's father, also John Tucker, applied to clear the land for conversion to pasture in 2009. His application was refused by the Forest Practices Authority, which argued his plan would not properly protect threatened species as required under the relevant laws. After losing his appeal of the decision, Mr Tucker Snr then applied for compensation, which was knocked back by Liberal Environment Minister Matthew Groom almost five years later. ""I am not satisfied that you have undertaken to manage the threatened native vegetation community under a conservation covenant or management agreement,"" Mr Groom wrote in his 2014 letter. Mr Tucker Jnr successfully submitted a new plan to the FPA in early 2015. Part of the Nature Conservation Act allows landowners who have not received compensation to reapply for certification. In the Supreme Court, the Tasmanian Conservation Trust argued the plan submitted by Mr Tucker Jnr was different to that submitted by his father so did not meet that clause. Justice Estcourt's decision agreed the FPA was ""wrong to believe, as it evidently did, that it had no alternative but to certify the 2015 plan"". He described one aspect of Senior Counsel Lisa De Ferrari's argument as ""not unlike that of Dennis Denuto"" — but ultimately quashed the FPA's 2015 decision to certify Mr Tucker's landclearing plan. Forest Practices Authority chief forest practices officer Peter Volker described the decision as ""a bit of a wake up call"". ""It shows that environmental law is changing all the time and community expectations are a lot higher than they used to be,"" Dr Volker said. ""I think it's a bit of a wake up call for the FPA as a regulator, landowners and the government in terms of the change in community expectations around land clearing and conservation of natural and cultural values. ""The decision's has given some legal clarification around some very grey areas."" The Supreme Court decision does not prevent Mr Tucker from reapplying to clear the land, but any application would be assessed under new laws — including the Commonwealth EPBC Act. In a statement, John Tucker said the decision was ""very detailed and involves complex questions of law which we are still considering with our counsel"". ""The decision to quash the determination of the Forest Practice Authority provides clarity going forward… that we can avoid in any future applications."" Mr Tucker said at ""all times my late father and I have acted upon the advice of professionals and followed the recommendations and advice of the FPA"".

McLachlan is suing the ABC, Nine Newspapers and actress Christie Whelan Browne over 2018 reports alleging he indecently assaulted, harassed, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan denies all claims of sexual harassment and bullying in the stories and says they ruined his reputation and put an end to his acting career. Under cross-examination in court Monday, the media's barrister, Michael Hodge QC, questioned McLachlan about a series of videos he sent to co-star Whelan Browne. Mr Hodge asked McLachlan if he texted a video of him ""purporting or pretending to masturbate"", to which McLachlan responded, ""fully clothed and not in a toilet, yes."" McLachlan was also accused of behaving crassly on set — something he strongly rejected, saying ""I don't use the word crassness in theatre"". The 56-year-old was subsequently questioned about a 12-minute blooper reel filmed in 2014 while McLachlan was a cast member on the ABC's The Doctor Blake Mysteries. Responding to questions from Mr Hodge, McLachlan admitted that in the video he is seen ""pretending to masturbate the arms of the crew"" and ""running up and kissing members of the crew"". Mr Hodge also asked: ""there's another thing you do on set; you do a performance when you have a banana, you pretend to fellate it?"" ""Yes,"" McLachlan responded. ""And then appear to deep-throat it?"" Mr Hodge questioned. ""The banana is already the appropriate shape but yes,"" McLachlan responded, adding that he didn't do it ""all the time"" but ""it's a joke I would perform."" Under questioning, McLachlan then agreed that this ""kind of sexual innuendo"" was brought by him onto the set of the 2014 Rocky Horror Show. Mr Hodge also suggested McLachlan manipulated co-star Whelan Browne into apologising for not congratulating him on being nominated for a 2014 Helpmann Award. McLachlan told the court he ""was confused"" by her lack of public congratulations because ""we were friends"". The jury heard that during this period, McLachlan emailed the show's director, Christopher Luscombe, referring to Ms Whelan Browne as a ""horror"" while also texting Whelan Browne, ""I've always supported you"". Hodge suggested this was evidence of ""manipulation"" — a suggestion McLachlan denied. McLachlan's team will have further opportunities to put forward their case as the trial continues. Later this afternoon, McLachlan's cross-examination finished and his partner, orchestral conductor Vanessa Scammell, entered the witness box. She described McLachlan as ""a wreck"" in the aftermath of the news reports and she became increasingly upset when testifying that his mental state was ""so damaged … I could barely get a constructive sentence out of him"". ""He was devastated, humiliated and betrayed,"" she told the court. ""He started to surf at night so [no one] would see him on the beach — such was his humiliation."" Ms Scammell will return to the stand tomorrow. The defamation trial is expected to run for another four weeks and will hear from 11 women who have accused McLachlan of inappropriate behaviour, claims he strongly denies.

36,Sculpture walk celebrating Yorta Yorta artists opens at Winton Wetlands,arts-culture,"  Winton Wetlands' sculpture walk celebrating Yorta Yorta artists opens A new sculpture walk has been unveiled at Winton Wetlands showcasing the work of Yorta Yorta artists. The Lotjpatj Natjan Danak, which means yarning and gathering pathway to sculptures, features 14 artworks from Yorta Yorta artists that represent special places, totems, cultural practices, and stories. The installation, which has been a collaboration between Winton Wetlands and the Yorta Yorta community, has been years in the making after receiving state government funding but was delayed by the pandemic. Winton Wetlands chief executive Sue Lebish said the group was thrilled the walk was open to the public. ""That collaboration has been extremely important because this is their land, we want them to come back and enjoy it and show everyone the interpretation they have in this land,"" she said. Yorta Yorta Nations Aboriginal Corporation representative for the project, Sonia Cooper, said it was exciting to see the project come together. ""With the support of the Yorta Yorta community and especially the artists and their families, this has happened, not only as a collaboration with the installation but making sure we bring the artist's ideas and their cultural expressions and their artistic expression out in the sculptures,"" she said. The pathway around the sculptures has been landscaped in the shape of a long-neck turtle, which is the totem of the Yorta Yorta people. ""The turtle is an indicator of wetlands health and river health, if you don't see the turtle cruising around or moving about then you must think something is up,"" Ms Cooper said. She said it was great to see the diversity in cultural expression across the artworks and people would be able to make their own connections to the area. ""While we have cultural expression, there is an element of contemporary works inside some of the art pieces as well, but it is linked to traditional cultural expression. ""Some are about the creation of country, it is about totemic species, it is about how that artist connections as an individual to country.""

37,Australia's Sheldon Riley impressed the Eurovision national juries. But what did the public think?,arts-culture,"  Australia's Sheldon Riley garners support from national juries at Eurovision In order to earn your place at the top of the glittery Eurovision ladder, singers need to be popular with both the public and the professional juries which cast their vote to decide a winner. SPOILERS AHEAD: You have been warned! And Australia's Sheldon Riley was very popular with these professional juries, which are made up of participating countries that can vote for each other but not themselves. Riley received a respectable 123 points from these juries. But when those points were combined with the public vote, his overall score was 125. That's right – just two votes from the public. When that was announced, the room showed its support for Australia, which has been a participant in Eurovision since 2015 when it competed in the 60th anniversary of the song contest in what was meant to be a one-off affair. ""This has been the most incredible experience of my entire life,"" Riley said. ""It's all I ever wanted."" He went on to say he was told for a long time that dreaming of performing in Eurovision was futile. He was not too worried about where he placed. He was happy to have made it to the grand final. ""My performance was received so well by the room and it means the absolute world,"" Riley said. ""This is everything I could have dreamed of."" Riley was dressed in a flowing white outfit weighted in pearls and paired with a crystal mask when he took to the Eurovision stage to sing Not The Same. The 23-year-old from the Gold Coast mirrored his Australia Decides performance when he removed his mask towards the end of the song in a dramatic reveal — but he wasn't quite as overcome by emotion this time. Diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome at age six, the Filipino-Australian performer is best known for his work on reality TV shows such as The Voice and America's Got Talent. The Eurovision stage is the biggest one he's been on — it's the world's largest live music event. Australia finished in 15th place. Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra came out on top with the song Stefania, scoring a massive 430 points from televoters alone to take a total of 631 points. The United Kingdom, which typically doesn't place well in Eurovision, shot up to second place with Sam Ryder's SPACE MAN. The competition was this year held in Turin, Italy.

38,What tales do the ghost signs in your town tell?,arts-culture,"  Ghost signs of Australia's advertising past are more than faded memories Faded signs are the ghosts of advertisers past — once carefully hand-painted on billboards or business walls, then neglected and ignored for decades, they have become markers of our cultural history. These derelict advertisements are known as ""ghost signs"" and they attract a certain type of ghost hunter. Photographer Brady Michaels and partner and co-author Dale Campisi have toured Australia in an old mini-van to snap and catalogue the elusive phantoms. ""We call them ghost signs because they are ghosts of the past,"" Mr Michaels said. ""They are faded and have that ghostly appearance because they are faded, so the term really fits. ""Ghost signs generally refer to the hand-painted signs. My definition is a bit broader, because I will look at any old, faded sign."" Mr Michaels and Mr Campisi travelled about 40,000 kilometres on the way to producing their book, Signs of Australia. They are part of a serious and growing sign-hunting community. ""Their mission in life is to document these signs and to share them,"" Mr Michaels said. ""They're not all photographers, but I come at it from a more 'arty', photographic point of view."" The photo is only part of the joy of being a ""ghost hunter"". Much of the joy also comes from the hunt itself. ""It is definitely a treasure hunt, not knowing what you will find. It's a bit hit and miss,"" Mr Michaels said. ""I start with a search engine. You will find stuff there because there is already a community which includes ex-signwriters."" Mr Michaels said mining towns offer rich pickings as businesses there go through boom-and-bust cycles. Towns such as Broken Hill, Coober Pedy, Charters Towers, Clunes, and Ballarat are happy hunting grounds for ghost sign hunters. ""Different towns have different relationships with their old signs. Some towns painted over them with a view that old signs suggested towns that hadn't moved with the times,"" Mr Michaels said. ""Others have not been touched and are still there. But there are also old towns that recognise the appeal of these signs to draw people in."" Author and researcher Amy Tsilemanis tracked down and documented many old signs in and around Ballarat for a heritage project in 2015. ""I was asked to create a digital trail for Ballarat Heritage Weekend and that led to co-producing the website Ballarat Revealed,"" Dr Tsilemanis said. ""That site is still available for people to explore as they walk around the city. ""The first trail was about buildings and we created a slider function where you could see the site as it was in the past and what it looks like now. ""For the following year I worked on a second trail, with local historian and archivist Lauren Bourke, finding and photographing ghost signs around town and researching the stories behind them through local libraries and historical groups, Trove, and Public Records Office Victoria. ""It's always important when doing research like this to credit your sources because so much work goes into collating and maintaining historical information."" Dr Tsilemanis's research uncovered signs and stories of dentists, dressmakers, brewers, grocers, hoteliers, and more. ""As a lover of vintage advertising I was drawn to ones like Richards and Co photographers and the vivid descriptions of their wares, or really sweet ones like Jim and Marg Welsh's dance studio,"" Dr Tsilemanis said. ""Many people around town will still remember fondly learning to dance there. ""There's also the ones that reveal stories of immigration and how people made homes and formed communities in Ballarat."" Some ghost signs celebrate products which still exist. Others mark brands that have become ghosts themselves. Holden is as iconic as any Australian brand. The logos and signs that still mark former dealerships have become tourist destinations for Holden owners with a penchant for photography. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Ballarat's weekly email newsletter. ABC Ballarat's classic car correspondent John Emery said car lovers appreciated some of the old signs almost as much as their own old cars. ""These brands were a very big part of Australian history and that's why there is still so much affection for these signs,"" he said. ""There are no new Holdens anymore, so the signs don't really advertise anything now. But they are a visual reminder of that important history. ""It's not just car brands. Golden Fleece had service stations all over the place. Golden Fleece no longer exists as a brand but many of the signs are still there."" Some ghost signs maintain a presence even when they have completely faded or been painted over, Mr Emery said. ""There used to be a Peters Ice Cream sign at Sandown Raceway and that corner became known as Peters Corner,"" he said. ""The old signs have been painted over, but that corner will always be known as Peters Corner.""

39,'Giving the sad demise of majestic creatures another purpose': When it's your job to wade through dead whale blubber and guts ,arts-culture,"  Whale bone collector uncovering secrets of world's largest marine mammals David Stemmer's job as head of the SA Museum's cetacean collection sometimes has him knee-deep in tonnes of blood and offal to recover rotting carcasses of the largest mammals on earth, but he's happily turning the ugly into something beautiful for the world to see. The SA Museum has the largest and most comprehensive collection of cetacea in Australia attracting researchers from around the world. About 38 different species of whales, dolphins and porpoises are stored for research with the bulk of the 1,400 piece collection made up of 900 dolphin specimens. Mr Stemmer said the collection allowed research on population dynamics to help preserve the marine mammals by identifying and minimising human impact. But there are logistical considerations and limits on their ability to learn more about the largest cetaceans — some whales are very rarely sighted while others are too remote or bulky to be recovered. ""In general, the large whales are much, much harder to study because of their size,"" Mr Stemmer said. ""You can't have 20 blue whales in your collection because there's not a lot of room and that makes it a little bit harder to study. ""For some studies, you need lots of individuals to be able to get a good answer — the classic morphological study that is done on smaller animals can't be done."" Scientists used the smallest molecules to learn about the largest animals. ""A lot of the studies involve the molecular, looking at genetics,"" Mr Stemmer said. ""With the baleen whales, you can sample the baleen plates for isotopes. ""They grow a bit like hair, they're keratin, and they grow over time so you can sample them along the outer edge and extract the different isotope signatures from where they've been through their lives because different areas have different isotope signatures."" COVID travel restrictions have impacted research. ""Pre-COVID, we had visitors every now and again studying the collection because one of the other problems with cetaceans is they're too big to post around the world and the country,"" Mr Stemmer said. What happens when a whale dies at sea and is washed ashore? The team waited for a baleen whale researcher from the US to be able to travel and assist in dissecting a rare pygmy right whale that came from Port Lincoln. Mr Stemmer said the fishing industry helped collect and freeze the whale. ""They managed to collect that whole whale for use and put it in one of their bait freezers,"" he said. ""We kept it in the freezer until the US researcher could fly over to us to dissect that whale with us — it was quite exciting."" The pygmy right whale is in its own family and is one of the smallest whales at about 6 metres in length. ""There aren't many places in the world where they occur and Port Lincoln is a hot spot — most of our pygmy right whale specimens have come from  Port Lincoln,"" Mr Stemmer said. He said it was exciting when a stranding was discovered. ""We find out about whale strandings pretty quickly and with smartphones we get photos and we can decide whether to collect it if it's accessible,"" Mr Stemmer said. ""You will literally be knee deep in blood and guts when you collect large whales. ""And you have to be able to keep breathing until you don't notice the smell anymore. ""We actually had to hire a front end loader to move a whale further up the beach so we could collect it and sharks were feeding off it as well."" At other times, just a sample of the whale would be taken. ""There was a large male sperm whale and we couldn't collect the whole animal, that was just too much but the local park ranger used a chainsaw to cut the lower jaws off for us."" Smaller specimens are placed in a 2,500-litre maceration vat with heated water that rots the flesh from the bones — a process that takes several months. ""We also have a large concrete tank, swimming pool size, 35,000 litres, where we put large whales but that tank is not heated so we're relying on a nice warm summer for the animal to rot away,"" he said. Mr Stemmer enjoyed giving a second life to the whales. ""To go out on a beach and have this dead, stinking blob there, collect it and turn it into a beautiful skeleton for the collection — it gives the sad demise of one of these majestic creatures another purpose.""

40,"When Sarah's world began shrinking, she bought a drone ",arts-culture,"  The sun beats down on Sarah Jenkins' right shoulder as her daughter lifts her into a sling chair next to the pool. Her hands curl and grip the poles as she is hoisted into the air and swung around. Her toes find the water first, then her ankles, then all but her green eyes submerge below the surface. Except for the green noodle she uses to support her arms, Sarah swims unaided. It is the one time she can move alone. ""The most important thing I can do is swim every day ... I think swimming basically saved my life,"" she says. Sarah moves from one side of the pool to the other, each footstep slow but deliberate. She grabs the side for extra support. As she walks, she gets what feel like ""zaps"" up her leg. ""It doesn't happen for the majority of the day,"" she says. ""[Swimming] just gives me the most amazing feeling and sensation, because you're stimulating the nerves."" It's that feeling of freedom that led Sarah to find her new passion — drone photography — at the height of lockdown. ""What's funny is that I can't take a photo with any other apparatus,"" she says. ""I can't use a standard camera and I can't use a mobile phone — I can't hold it up."" Sarah lives with a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy called LGMD2i (also called FKRP-related LGMD R9), one of the world's rare diseases. It started to present itself in her late teens as her performance decreased when swimming. ""I thought, oh, it's just puberty, I'm just slowing down."" When Sarah started her nursing career, people would ask her why she was limping as she walked down the corridor. ""I would say I'm not limping ... people noticed it before I did,"" she says. ""When I was 30, I went to an aerobics class, and we all had to get on our tippy toes, and I couldn't. So I went, okay, this is weird... and that's when I started doing testing."" Only a few hundred or thousand people in Australia are thought to have LGMD2i. ""It affects your respiratory muscles, so your diaphragm and intercostal muscles that help your lungs expand and contract are weakened,"" Sarah says. ""So my breathing is affected and usually that is what ends a person's life with muscular dystrophy. It is respiratory or cardiac failure — or both."" After she was diagnosed, Sarah fell pregnant with her first daughter Lucy and a year later, her second daughter Tess. It was during this period of her life that she started to feel a decline in her condition. ""I remember when I used to sit on the grass for picnics. And I thought, one day I'm not going to be able to get up."" That moment came in 2016, when her dog Pippa ran underneath her legs in her narrow hallway, and she broke her leg. ""From that day on, I never stood up again. I never walked. I never drove a car ... my whole life changed dramatically."" Drones came into Sarah's life at a time when her world was shrinking, as COVID lockdowns were closing in. During Melbourne's long lockdown, her daughter Lucy came to live with her in Port Douglas and, together, they decided they would buy one. ""We just said, what are we going to do? We've got to do something. I couldn't really do anything in the community, because I was high risk to COVID, I was pretty much having to isolate from people,"" Sarah says. She admits she was initially terrified she would crash it and didn't want to fly it herself. ""I gradually built confidence flying it, and I just saw the Earth from a different perspective."" In November 2020, Sarah organised a photo shoot inspired by COVID lockdowns and a recent artwork she had painted. ""I just got this idea of using a basketball court, just down the road, and I thought, what if I put this girl in the middle of the court, reading a magazine, supposedly having a really nice time, in the midst of this chaos that was going on in the world, making compromises to still be happy and enjoy life?"" She went and bought a pool ring and borrowed a little bag. ""It was 10 o'clock in the morning, and it was so hot,"" Sarah recalls of the shoot. ""The poor girl had to sit on a towel underneath the pool ring, and we just had to measure out. She was in the middle of the court, and I put the drone up, and I just started shooting."" The Boston Drone Film Festival found Sarah and Lucy's picture on their Instagram page, Air Bare Studio, and asked them to enter it in their competition. To their delight, their image won the architecture category in 2021, less than a year after they began experimenting with the drone. ""We felt a little like we didn't deserve the award as we were so inexperienced... but it gave us the confidence to enter another competition, which was Capture Magazine's Australasia's Top Emerging Photographers,"" Sarah says. The same image took home that award in the Single Shot category. An international publishing company has recently chosen 16 of Sarah and Lucy's images for their new book on minimalism in photography. Sarah says picking up a drone has helped reignite her creativity through a new lens. She loved painting during school and her early adult years and has had a deep appreciation for art and design ever since. ""Photography is no different to creating a painting — it's all about composition, orientation, framing, colour and tone, and it should tell a story,"" she says. ""I really do love to look at things in a minimalist way... to zero in on a particular section of an image for things that are quirky and unique. ""You've got to look at things from so many different perspectives to understand the real meaning of it."" Still, she laughs: ""We don't always hit the mark."" Even though Lucy is back living in Melbourne, Sarah has continued to experiment and looks forward to studying an online photography course this year. ""Photography has just made me realise that it is something I can absolutely do,"" she says. ""The drone can take me to places that I can't physically get to and create images I ordinarily wouldn't be able to.""

42,Unpacking the cameos in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,arts-culture,"  What's with all the cameos in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness? Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness has been attracting largely positive reviews from critics and is already the third biggest film of the year at the worldwide box office. It's also had fans cheering and applauding at the sight of its many multiversal cameos, some of which were signposted in the trailers, and others that were tightly guarded secrets. Who are these fan-familiar faces that have had diehard Marvel-heads in a frenzy, and what does it mean for the ever-expanding and seemingly endless Marvel cinematic universe (MCU)? Read on to find out more, but beware — here be spoilers. The bulk of the cool cameos that have fans spilling their popcorn and spit-taking their soft drink comes from a mid-film appearance by a group known as the Illuminati. Much like with the real-world conspiracy theory, the Illuminati of the Marvel comics is a secret cabal of some of the best and brightest who secretly run the world. The group was formed by Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) in the wake of an intergalactic battle that threatened Earth, after Stark realised several super-powered individuals had key information about the aliens involved but didn't share it with each other. The first version of the comic-book Illuminati featured Iron Man, Reed Richards (aka Mr Fantastic), Professor Charles Xavier of the X-Men, Black Bolt of the Inhumans, Black Panther of Wakanda, Sorcerer Supreme Dr Stephen Strange and Namor the Sub-Mariner of Atlantis. Over the years, the group has gathered in secret to discuss how to deal with major threats, including deciding to shoot the Hulk into space due to him proving too much of a danger to Earth (which totally backfired in the excellent World War Hulk comic series). They've also tackled Incursions, which are mentioned in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and occur when two neighbouring multiverses threaten to collide and destroy each other unless one can be destroyed. The Illuminati's members have changed over the years and the group has disbanded a couple of times, but their mission to save Earth remains a regular way for comic book writers to explore morality, sacrifice, philosophical ideas and the notion that even the smartest people can do incredibly stupid things. But what you really want to know is who's in the MCU version of the Illuminati? Here goes — last chance to bail before the spoilers. There's been talk of a Marvel reboot or crossover of the X-Men since Disney bought 20th Century Fox in a deal finalised in 2019. It's finally kinda sorta happened here with Professor X appearing as part of the Illuminati on Earth-838 (that's the number assigned to the Illuminati's multiverse). The OG Xavier, as played by Stewart for the eighth time, makes his appearance to the sound of the nostalgic theme from the '90s X-Men cartoon, not looking like he's aged a day since 2017's Logan. Stewart's cameo not only officially crosses the streams of the Fox X-Men movies and the MCU, but suggests there are other mutants in this universe and his School for Gifted Youngsters probably exists. Played by Miles Teller in 2015's Fantastic Four, Ioan Guffudd before that in 2005 and 2007, and Alex Hyde-White in the legendary unreleased 1994 version, Krasinski's iteration of Mr Fantastic got a lot of whoops and cheers in cinemas. A tightly kept secret, Krasinski as Reed Richards has been a dream fan casting, and the reaction to his appearance backs it up. While we don't see Richards use his ultra-stretchy limbs much before he meets a painful end, it's probably a safe bet to say this isn't the last time we'll see Krasinski's Mr Fantastic in the MCU, given his popular reception and the fact a Fantastic Four reboot is in development. But it begs the question: Will we get to see the equally popular fan casting of Krasinski's wife, Emily Blunt, as Richards' wife Sue Storm (aka the Invisible Woman) in the MCU? One of the best episodes of the animated Disney+ series What If introduced us to Captain Carter, the answer to the question: ""What if Peggy Carter received the super-soldier serum instead of Steve Rogers?"" The big-screen debut of Captain Carter gives Atwell the chance to put a new spin on the popular character of Peggy Carter, last seen slow-dancing with Captain America in the final moments of Avengers: Endgame. The live-action version of Captain Carter gives fans hope we'll see her again — while her Earth-838 version meets a grisly end via her own shield, she proves to be just as cool as her animated counterpart, or perhaps even cooler because she has a jet pack, and everyone knows jet packs make everything cooler. In the comics, there have been a number of Captain Marvels, including one named Monica Rambeau, who adopted the name before handing it back to Carol Danvers and becoming known as Photon, then Pulsar and eventually Spectrum — this kind of thing happens a lot in the comics. Monica Rambeau has appeared in the MCU previously; as a kid in 2019's Captain Marvel and as a grown-up government agent in the Disney+ series WandaVision. But it's her mother, Maria, as played by Lashana Lynch in Captain Marvel, that turns up here as the hyper-powered space warrior, suggesting an intriguing alternate path where Maria becomes Captain Marvel rather than her best friend and fellow fighter pilot Carol Danvers. This may be the last we see of Maria, but daughter Monica is appearing in the upcoming film The Marvels, fuelling speculation she'll become Photon — or is that Pulsar? Or Spectrum? Speaking of fuelling speculation, a split-second shot of Maria Rambeau in action in the trailer caused a frenzied online buzz that Tom Cruise would appear as an alternate multiverse Iron Man, but that wasn't to be. Take that as you will. It was a cameo that gave Scarlet Witch the best delivery of the best line in the film — ""What mouth?"" — and also one of the movie's most gruesome deaths. Black Bolt previously appeared in the TV series Inhumans, which lasted one season and received such bad reviews that only the most diehard of Marvel fans bothered to watch it. It's a shame it was so botched, because Black Bolt is a cool character — not that we get much of a chance to see it in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness before he inadvertently blows his own brains out using his super-powered voice. Given how poorly received Inhumans was, this could be the final appearance of Mount as Black Bolt. Of course, the deaths of all these characters doesn't necessarily preclude them from popping up in the MCU again in another film or their own spin-off TV shows – after all, this is the multiverse, so there are infinite versions of these superheroes populating an infinite number of universes. Theron took to social media recently to unveil her mid-credits appearance as Clea, a sorceress who magically appears in a New York street asking Dr Strange to follow her into the Dark Dimension to help prevent an Incursion. In the comics, Clea is the niece of Dormammu (the villain in the first Dr Strange film) and Strange's lover who joins him on a range of increasingly weird adventures. Given that Dormammu is still out there and Clea's appearance in the film is over as quickly as it begins, it's safe to say she'll play a substantial role in any future Dr Strange movies.

43,"Club celebrates 100 years of 'the thought sport', a nasty game for nice people",arts-culture,"  Nowra Croquet Club celebrates 100 years of playing 'the thought sport', a nasty game for nice people Those who play croquet say it is 15 per cent skill and 85 per cent psychology, an aggressive game played by nice people with a smile on their face. The nice people of Nowra Croquet Club celebrate a century of play this year, and today launch a book acknowledging and celebrating 100 years since the club's inception. Secretary of Nowra Croquet Club, Karen James, instigated the production of the book. It proudly highlights a unique feature of the club — being largely women-only for a majority of its history. But it is not a ladies club anymore. ""Our first male, as is shown in the book, did not become a member until 1982, so that's a long time of it being [only for] ladies, and of course they played in long skirts."" ""Ladies played to the side with their mallet because it was unseemly for a woman to push a mallet between her legs."" Patience, persistence, and a playful spirit is required for this hard-hitting game. ""It's called 'the thought sport' and that's particularly important for us older people,"" said 82-year-old player David Knott. The Nowra Croquet Club and members play a big role Mr Knott's life, who joined the club five years ago and plays frequently. ""It's a very strategic game and there is a lot of thought in it,"" Mr Knott said. ""You're looking to outsmart your opponent. You're looking for the position of their balls versus the position of your own balls. You have to assess what stroke you are going to make for the benefit of scoring that hoop. ""The art is moving the opponents' balls as far away as possible."" ""You have to think and you're exercising all the time. That's the important thing — you keep moving."" Pam Harrison started playing croquet when she was 89. She is now 91 and not only does she love it, according to club members she is also quite good. ""You can still play croquet with a walker, you just have to leave it there for a moment while you grab your mallet and hit the ball, then come back to your walker,"" Ms Harrison said. ""I love it. Anybody who has got a walker and thinks they should come, just come, because you'll be made very welcome."" Doug Cornish, vice-captain and grounds coordinator at the club, agrees the game employs something akin to war tactics. ""A lot of players will say it's an aggressive game played by nice people with a smile on their face,"" he said. Out on the lawn you have four options. ""It's all about deciding whether you can run a hoop, or whether you need to clear an opponent or block an opponent, or promote your partner ball,"" he said. However, Mr Cornish said a key ingredient to a good game was patience. ""Don't rush in. Look at what your options are, and then if you want to get really technical you'd look at what the percentage of performing a particular shot is,"" he said. Karen James believes that at their club, which supports over 60 members, players understand the importance of sport. ""People are realising, for longevity, the importance of sport,"" she said. ""[It is important] to keep going and to keep not only physically active but socially active, so you are interacting as well. ""This game is perfect for those people who can't run the marathon any more or swing a golf club or even bend down to bowl.""

45,New play dives into issues of grief and depression — but with light on the surface,arts-culture,"  New State Theatre Company play Cathedral dives into issues of grief and depression Ten-year-old Caleb Lewis sat with his sister on a jetty watching his dad sink below the water, unsure if he would ever come back. It was the mid-1990s on a family trip from Melbourne to Adelaide which had come to a temporary halt near Mount Gambier. ""Dad told us all about this place called Piccaninnie Ponds, where quite a few fatalities have occurred,"" Lewis vividly recalled. ""It's an exquisite ecosystem, but one that if you are inexperienced it can very quickly become dangerous. ""Dad told us about that as kids, then put his diving tanks on and we just sat on the jetty waiting for him to come back — just waiting — going: 'What happens if he doesn't come back? What happens if the bubbles stop?'"" Fast forward several decades and Lewis, now 44 and a writer, has continued that tradition after unveiling his latest play, Cathedral. It was a work State Theatre Company South Australia commissioned; originally to be about tuna fishermen and Port Lincoln, before a rethink saw it being based on the south-eastern city of Mount Gambier. The production tells the story of a diver who is suffering from nitrogen narcosis (a change in consciousness and neuromuscular function) while at the bottom of a flooded sinkhole, how he ended up down there and how he will get out, if at all. As he worked on the production, Lewis got in contact with Mount Gambier diver Josh Richards, before spending time with him on the Limestone Coast. Richards had his own story to tell which became part of Cathedral. ""There's a point in the play where someone escapes and there's a physical injury that's sustained during that escape,"" he said. ""That's drawn from a story I was involved in where I injured myself quite badly trying to squeeze out of a cave. ""Coming back out, I left one piece of equipment on, which was the one piece of equipment that stuck. ""I was halfway through this tight little hole and I couldn't go any further up or down and I wound up stuck there for six or seven minutes, which was pretty unpleasant,"" he remembered. It was these stories that added to Lewis's many experiences with the water. They included his dad being a diver who helped fish bodies out of the Yarra River, after people jumped off the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne. The now Queensland-based Lewis studied acting and playwriting at Flinders University. When he was 22, he visited his father who was working on an oil rig near Dubai. Lewis temporarily became a firefighting instructor, which included time undertaking training for search and rescue operations, and underwater helicopter escapes. That long history with water and survival stretched back to Lewis's grandfather, who was a bomber in World War II in Europe. His plane crashed into the Danube River and he was one of two crew who managed to swim out of the rapidly sinking plane, joining the ""goldfish club"" for airmen who survived crashes. It seemed fitting that water became that central theme when the State Theatre Company enlisted him to write Cathedral. But writing it became deeply personal at a time in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its worst and personal tragedies had hit Lewis. ""We suffered several deaths in my own family, in particular as a young boy, and I think part of the play was processing the grief — it's about a guy who wakes up in a dark hole and had to find his way out of it,"" he said. ""It's absolutely [got] autobiographical elements — I've suffered depression for years and I remember this incredible sense of release and relief when I was formerly diagnosed."" A critical factor in Lewis staying healthy is going on long-distance walks. ""That's made a profound difference, actually, and something I stumbled on,"" he said. ""There's a loosening up of the body and mind that came from ambling, of going for those long distance walks and you surrender yourself to the moment — you let go of all the anxiety."" Those walks included hiking Germany's Black Forest, fittingly where the Brothers Grimm gathered inspiration for their folktales. ""That was cool, that was a really terrific time,"" Lewis said. ""I brought a copy of the Brothers Grimm and I'd just pull up under a tree and read a couple of fairytales and wonder what might come walking down the path. ""I sprinkled plenty of breadcrumbs behind me so I didn't get lost on my way back,"" he laughed. That ongoing battle with depression has changed his hardline stance on avoiding ""escapist theatre"", allowing his dark-themed plays to end with some optimism. ""There's got to be hope — you have to be able to lead them out into the dawn — I think 20-year-old Caleb would have written Cathedral with a dark ending,"" he explained. ""I'm interested in helping people to see the world in a different way and perhaps to grow a little and heal a little."" Cathedral is playing at Adelaide's Space Theatre until May 21, with a tour of regional South Australia to follow.

46,World famous Australian contemporary composer collaborates with Alice chamber orchestra,arts-culture,"  Elena Kats-Chernin, Australia's world famous contemporary composer, working with Alice Springs orchestra Central Australia boasts spectacular sunrises and sunsets, dark enough skies to see the edge of the milky way and the harsh searing heat of the midday sun. All these elements are the inspiration for a brand new piece of work by one of Australia's most prolific and well-known composers and pianists, Elena Kats-Chernin, who boasts a catalogue of 300 pieces. The Red Centre Suite is in four movements and has been written specifically for the Alice Springs World Chamber Orchestra, thanks to a chance meeting three years ago. The meeting was with Markus Kuchenbuch, the Alice Springs World Chamber Orchestra's artistic director, at a music festival in NSW. It is thanks to his tenacity that Kats-Chernin has not only composed a piece about the region, but has also come to Alice Springs to work directly with the orchestra. ""You never really think it's going to happen because not everyone follows through,"" Kats-Chernin said. ""However, Markus is the kind of person who follows through."" The four movements are Night Stars, Dawn, Noon, and Sunset, and was written without ever seeing the landscape. ""I have very rarely written about a place,"" she said. ""It's always extremely special to actually be in the place I have written about, especially if I wrote [the piece] before I actually came here, which is kind of unusual."" Kats-Chernin said that after many decades of composing it was hard to pinpoint the moment the material crystallises. ""It's always a mystery how a piece gets born,"" she said. ""I have perfected a skill, which is to move myself into a zone, mentally, into a particular place. ""I can place myself internally anywhere — be it emotion, flavour, a state of being, or a place I can imagine myself there."" Kats-Chernin said she was impressed with the calibre of Alice Springs' musicians ""and the quality of their preparation"". ""In the first rehearsal of the piece [it] actually sounded really good already. II was just overjoyed how much the base of the piece was already there,"" she said. ""Once the piece is written it's in the hands of musicians who perform it."" Kats-Chernin said it was a joy to work directly with the musicians. ""To have this direct communication with musicians in the room [so that] we can shape it and mould it, so that it sounds better, so that it makes more sense,"" she said. ""I can [then] tell what's more important in the texture of things. So I can say 'this instrument a bit louder, maybe softer, maybe bring out a certain warmth of the instrument, maybe play it colder'. So it just depends."" ABC Classic invites you to get to know a little bit more about Australian composer Elena Kats-Chernin. Kuchenbuch said that the feedback from the orchestra was very positive, given they had been playing Kats-Chernin's pieces for several years. ""They feel like they have touched fame to have someone of Kats-Chernin's calibre not only write them a piece but to work with them, given that she is booked out until 2024,"" he said. ""For her to have so much time to rehearse with us is very special.""

47,This dilapidated old tower could become regional Victoria's newest tourist attraction,arts-culture,"  Victorian regional tourism could benefit from Maryborough's Bristol Hill Pioneer Memorial Tower refurbishment Maryborough residents have called for the historic Bristol Hill Pioneer Memorial Tower to be redeveloped into a premier tourism destination. The iconic site was built in 1933 during the Great Depression with material from the Old Maryborough Gaol. It was named after Bristol Reef, a seam of gold in the area which was mined from the late 1850s and stands to remember the European settlers of the region. Located at the edge of Bristol Hill Reserve, the tower provides views of the town and surrounding bushland, and links to several walking tracks in Bristol Hill Reserve. Maryborough Rotary president Garry Higgins said the most important thing was that the building was restored and protected. ""We want to make sure the history of the place is not lost,"" Mr Higgins said. ""Whether it be state government or local government [looking after it] doesn't really matter. ""As long as somebody does it because nobody has been doing it over the last several years."" The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) has been the interim manager of Bristol Hill Tower since 2007. It met with the Rotary Club and the Central Goldfields Shire Council earlier this month to discuss future management of the site. The department was now awaiting the results of an engineer's report on the structural integrity of the tower to determine what repairs were required for it to be opened to the general public. The tower has been closed since it was vandalised last year. ""While DELWP is the interim manager of this space, our aim is to find the best manager to take this space forward long-term,"" a DELWP spokesperson said. ""Nothing is off the table. ""Further discussions about the management of this asset will continue following the outcome of the structural engineer's report, in the coming months."" A Central Goldfields Shire councillor said she would like the council to take responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the tower precinct. ""We haven't endorsed that we want to take ownership, but a few of the councillors believe that we should take responsibility for the ongoing maintenance,"" Grace Le Valla said. She said the shire was keen to listen to residents and turn the historic Bristol Hill Memorial Tower into something special. ""It hasn't been painted or anything since 1988. I believe it's been that long since anyone did anything to it,"" Ms Le Valla said. ""It looks terribly rundown."" Both state and local government authorities said they were keen to work with community groups on a redevelopment, despite who owned and managed the site. Mr Higgins said residents wanted to see the neglected structure brought back to life. ""The first thing is to just to make sure that the site is maintained as a significant historical site within our town,"" he said. The Rotary Club was just one community group the council planned to include in any future redevelopments. One suggestion was to turn it into a peace park. ""We want to look at how we can engage all elements of our community in developing a peace and harmony park,"" Mr Higgins said. ""We want to embrace all the different communities that have made Maryborough their own community. ""We want to put our arms around them and embrace them and make them feel part of our community."" Mr Higgins welcomed input from any community members who wanted to get involved in maintaining and revitalising the site.

48,Who are the top 10 chances for this year's Eurovision,arts-culture,"  We now have the final 25 songs that are vying to win the Eurovision Song Contest title in Turin. Australia's Sheldon Riley will be one of the performers with his big ballad Not the Same. If you want a bit of a form guide as to the likely winners, one option is the top 10 in the Eurovision winners' odds. Australia is just outside the top 10 but still primed for a good result. In a year when the common theme is a LOT of angsty ballads and dance numbers, there are a few stand-out upbeat songs … and one entry that could win this in a landslide — but could be nobbled by the juries. Let's check out the main chances! There's always room for a bit of performance art at Eurovision, and this striking performance from singer-songwriter Konstrakta (Ana Đurić)  has made an impression. The song, In Corpore Sano (In A Healthy Body), is a song about modern life, its focus on health and how to afford it. Her staging has Konstrakta seated on stage with a washing bowl in front of her, literally washing her hands during the performance, while her backing crew hand her towels. There are references to Meghan Markle, there's hand-clapping, it's all a bit hypnotic. The crowd loved it in the second semi-final. LYRICS: ""Oh, so how will they monitor me? In the name of health/And care about me? In the name of health/An artist (she) is invisible. In the name of health/You don't see me, it's magic. In the name of health"" This song also has a gun position in the draw. Just like last year's winners, Måneskin for Italy, Konstrakta will be performing in 24th place. S10 (Stien den Hollander) is a rising star on the local music scene — the 21-year-old indie pop/rap/dance artist sings in Dutch. Fitting in with the angst theme in 2022, her song, De Diepte (The Deep), is about a person who is lost and confused. It starts as a gentle guitar ballad, and then swells in the middle. The staging is spare and revolves around the singer and her emotional performance. LYRICS: ""Here in the deep I continue to hear your name/Ooh aha. Oh my love what do I do?/I am deep and I don’t want to let you go"" If you like your Eurovision entries with a healthy dose of bonkers, this one might be for you. The mystery group are dressed in suits with yellow-gold masks on, two of them come with wolf-like teeth. Behind them is a DJ dressed like an astronaut — who is supposedly last year's Norwegian entrant, TIX — on a sort of plinth above the stage. Their performance comes complete with a full dance routine, a driving beat, synthesisers and the kitchen sink (well, not quite). LYRICS: ""Is that saliva or blood dripping off your chin?/ If you don't like the name Keith, I'mma call you Jim/And before that wolf eats my grandma/Give that wolf a banana"" This should go down an absolute treat with the televoters, but the juries might be looking for something slightly less ""out there"" for their winner. In a year full of break-up and heartbreak songs, this one is possibly the starkest — just check out the title and the lyrics below. Sheldon Riley's Eurovision adventure has been a wild ride — from winning Australia Decides on the Gold Coast to losing his voice in London, practising his song while carrying sandbags and now the spotlight in Turin — on the eve of his contest debut, he tells the ABC how it's all come together. Amanda Georgiadi Tenfjord is a Greek-born singer of Greek and Norwegian parentage. She has a striking voice and this is a dramatic song, with the staging putting the spotlight on her. If you take your Eurovision history seriously, this is an omen pick for the win. The most successful positions in the Eurovision running list — to win the contest in the modern era since organisers began selecting the order — are 17th and 24th, both with three wins. Greece will perform in 17th on Sunday morning. LYRICS: ""But if we die together now/We will always have each other/I won't lose you for another/And if we die together now/I will hold you till forever"" Krystian Ochman is this year's performer for Poland. He's from the United States but won the Polish version of The Voice two years ago. As you might imagine, he has one of the best voices on show at this year's Eurovision, and he has chosen a big song to showcase it. River has a touch of the Hozier's about it. It's an emotional number that talks about letting go and has a water theme as the name suggests. The staging includes an effect that makes it look to the TV audience like there is water running down the camera lens. It's a dramatic performance, and should do well with the juries, but it may fall short with the public unless they fall in love with his voice. LYRICS: ""Bury all of my things/Bury me in my skin/All that I've done/ Oh Lord, I'm done/Who'd wanna be a king/Pulling too many strings"" The last time Spain won Eurovision was in 1968, with a song that had 123 la's in a song that was, unsurprisingly, called La, La, La. Indeed, the past decade or two at Eurovision has been pretty bleak for Spain, with a lot of poor finishes. A glance at the translated lyrics tells you where this one is going: ""I make all the daddies go crazy/I'm always first, never secondary/As soon as I make doom, doom with my boom, boom/And I got him making zoom, zoom/For my yummy"" This one is definitely going to pick up the same sort of vote that Cyprus got with Fuego a few years back — that came second — and so might this if it hoovers up enough public support. Hosting nations have not done well in recent years, perhaps because no one wants to repeat the Irish experience, when they won four times in five years in the 1990s, nearly bankrupting broadcaster RTE. Italy are the hosts this year, and they have a shot at going back-to-back with the pop-rap ballad Brividi (Shivers). Mahmood came second in 2019, singing Soldi. He and singer-rapper Blanco are two of Italy's top stars, and their duet is breaking new ground. Mahmood says it's not necessarily an LGBTQ love song, but it is an emotional performance from two male vocalists that has grabbed attention. LYRICS: ""And I would pay to go away/I would even accept a lie/And I want to love you, but I'm always wrong/And I get shivers, shivers, shivers"" Regular viewers of Eurovision will know that whatever song Sweden sends is rarely too far away from the pointy end of the contest come voting time. We're there again this year. Cornelia Jakobs was the winner of the Swedish song competition Melodifestivalen, which decides who goes to Eurovision. This well-written, well-performed heartbreaker is about saying goodbye to your lover after one more night. It's not the first Eurovision song to mine this territory, and it wouldn't be the first winner either — 35 years ago, Ireland's Johnny Logan won the contest and had a big hit with Hold Me Now. LYRICS: ""Hold me closer/Although you'll leave before the sunrise/Might be bleeding, but don't you mind, I'll be fine/Oh it kills me/I found the right one at the wrong time"" There's a bit of history on the line here as well — if Cornelia wins, it will be the seventh time that Sweden has been victorious, matching Ireland's record from the '70s, '80s and '90s. This is NOT a misprint! After years of a serious lack of love from the voters of Europe — including last year, where James Newman was very hard done by when he received the first ever double zero (no votes from the juries OR the televoters) for his song, Embers — the United Kingdom is back with a bang. Sam Ryder is a TikTok star who racked up 12 million followers during the pandemic with his fun (and excellent) covers of various hit songs. His followers include Sia, Alicia Keys and Justin Bieber. He has brought the same sense of fun — and knockout vocals — to this slice of British-sounding pop, combining an upbeat sound with more angsty lyrics. Ryder has an impressive upper register, and he gives it a workout in this song, while the staging has a sense of ""lift-off"". This has been going up in the odds all through the contest. LYRICS: ""I'm up in space, man/Up in space, man/I've searched around the universe/Been down some black holes/There's nothing but space, man/And I wanna go home."" If this was any other year, this would be an even bigger chance to take home the prize — the reason it's not is because of — Song-wise, there's a number of more-impressive entries in the final, although both the performance and the staging get the most out of this. Stefania was originally written for the grandmother of one of the members of Kalush Orchestra — but the song, which fuses folk and hip-hop, has since taken on a life of its own. One of the translated lyrics says:""I'll always find my way home/Even if all the roads are destroyed"" LYRICS: ""Stefania mother mother Stefania/The field is blooming, but her hair is turning grey/Mother, sing me the lullaby/I want to hear your native word"" The real issue is whether the people of Europe — and Australia — decide they want to show their support for Ukraine, given current events, by giving their vote to Kalush Orchestra. The spotlight at this year's Eurovision Song Contest is firmly on Ukraine's entry, with Kalush Orchestra strong favourites as their country continues to fight an invasion from Russia, so that raises the question of who will host the contest in 2023 if they win. Countries cannot vote for themselves, but there could still be 39 sets of 12 votes coming Ukraine's way if the public is of a similar mind. This won't do as well with the juries — but if it sweeps the board with the public that won't matter.

49,"Craig McLachlan denies throwing tantrums, calling co-stars 'ungrateful and untalented' in court",arts-culture,"  Craig McLachlan denies throwing tantrums, calling co-stars 'ungrateful and untalented' in court Actor Craig McLachlan has denied to his defamation trial that he frequently threw backstage tantrums during a production of The Rocky Horror Show and, on one occasion, called his co-stars ""ungrateful and untalented c***s"". The 56-year-old is suing the ABC and Nine Entertainment Co over stories published in 2018 which alleged he assaulted female cast members during a 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. He is also suing actor Christie Whelan Browne, who played the female lead in the show, and was interviewed by the news outlets. McLachlan denies all claims of sexual harassment and bullying in the stories and says they ruined his reputation and put an end to his acting career. On Friday, the media outlets' barrister, Michael Hodge QC, tried to depict McLachlan as a man with a temper who would take his frustrations out on his co-stars. He asserted that during one show on May 9, 2014, McLachlan was so angry about a scene that had not gone as planned he yelled and swore at his colleagues backstage before kicking a rubbish bin. ""You said 'you're a bunch of untalented, ungrateful c***s',"" Mr Hodge told the court. ""No I did not,"" McLachlan said. The actor also rejected claims he forcefully grabbed Whelan Browne's face on stage later that night and said he only found out she made a bullying complaint when he read the news reports four years later. McLachlan also rejected ""storming off"" after musical supervisor Tony Castro gave him singing advice and telling his co-stars that ""[Mr Castro] wouldn't like the food at Sydney Hospital"". Throughout the trial, McLachlan has maintained he enjoyed jovial relationships with many of his female co-stars and ""theatrical"" yet platonic hugs and kisses were common. On Friday, he told the court it was possible he sat on the lap of actor Erika Heynatz and kissed her neck backstage one day, but strongly denied putting his crotch in her lap or ever entering her dressing room without consent. The long-time performer repeatedly claimed he and Whelan Browne were good friends throughout the show, but on Friday the court was shown an email which McLachlan sent to production director calling Whelan Browne ""Lucifer"". The email read: ""I was privately celebrating London's directive that the perpetually problematic Whelan Browne be sent packing."" ""Lucifer is being given another chance next week. Really???? OMG. ""The princess wins again … we all continue to march to the sound of her selfish, delusional, disrespectful and frankly nasty drum."" McLachlan said those were only his ""professional"" views of Whelan Browne and ""friends call each other all sorts of things"". Eleven women will give evidence during the trial alleging McLachlan behaved inappropriately during various theatre and TV productions and will detail allegations of groping and indecent exposure. One actor also in The Rocky Horror Show, Angela Scundi, accused McLachlan of an unwanted kiss on stage in which he used his tongue, but on Friday McLachlan told the court it was a ""peck"". The jury were shown raw footage from McLachlan's interview with Channel Seven program Spotlight last year which showed he and his partner re-enacting the scene to try and prove a ""pash"" wasn't possible given the musical timing. McLachlan was also seen telling the Channel Seven interviewer that he was the ""star of the f****n show"" and he would never put the scene at risk by lingering for a kiss. The trial continues.

50,"$100,000 Archibald Prize goes to portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens by Blak Douglas",arts-culture,"  Archibald Prize won by Blak Douglas for portrait of artist Karla Dickens, the second time an Indigenous artist has won Dhungutti artist Blak Douglas (aka Adam Hill) has won the $100,000 Archibald Prize for his portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens — the second Indigenous artist to win the prize in its 101 years, following Western Arrernte artist Vincent Namatjira in 2020. This is Douglas's fifth time as an Archibald finalist, and accepting the prize at the Art Gallery of NSW ceremony, the self-taught painter said: ""This painting represents 20 years of taking the risk of pursuing a dream [and] surrendering normalised employment. And I'm sure many of my artist colleagues can relate to that."" Douglas painted Dickens, a friend and in his words ""legendary practitioner"", knee-deep in the muddy floodwaters of her hometown in Lismore, Bundjalung Country — holding a leaking pail of water in each hand, and looking grumpy. His painting reflects on the damage and after-effects of the devastating February and March floods in the Northern Rivers. ""I've been up there [to Bundjalung Country] several times; it's a war zone,"" Douglas told ABC News. ""And so to be able to further aid some of my dearest, closest friends up there, through this win — not only metaphorically, but also financially — it's a big plus."" The portrait, titled Moby Dickens, also speaks to Dickens's frustration with the government response to the February and March floods. Speaking to ABC Arts in April, she said: ""[I told Adam] 'As long as you make it grumpy. I want to be grumpy.'"" ""If [the painting] makes one more person aware of what's happened where I live, I'm really grateful for that,"" Dickens said. Speaking via live video link from her home, during the ceremony, Dickens said she was ""over the moon"", and thanked her friend for ""acknowledging everybody up here on Bundjalung Country that has gone through so much"". ""I'm so proud of you, Adam. Such a killer painting,"" she added. The judges also highly commended artist Jude Rae's portrait of Australian engineer and inventor Saul Griffith. The $40,000 Sulman Prize (for ""subject painting, genre painting or mural project""), meanwhile, was awarded to artist duo Claire Healy and Sean Cordeiro for their mixed-media painting Raiko and Shuten-dōji, depicting the fight between the warrior Raiko and the demon Shuten-dōji. The $50,000 Wynne Prize for landscape painting went to Nicholas Harding for his work Eora. Accepting the award, Douglas acknowledged his ancestors: ""My Irish Scot, German and English mob, as well as … the Dhungutti of mid-north coast New South Wales."" ""This is incredibly historic, given that I'm the first Koori to paint a Koori to win the Archibald Prize; the first First Nations New South Wales Aboriginal artist [to win]."" Douglas is a self-taught painter whose pop art aesthetic is informed by training in graphic design, illustration and photography. ""My dear family have been supportive all the way along through this career to get to this point,"" he told assembled onlookers. ""Particularly the matriarchs in my family; women are a very strong part of my family."" Speaking to ABC News afterwards, he described the path to his winning painting as ""a long haul"". ""It felt like building part of the Great Wall [of China] just painting this thing; it's quite a task to paint something that big."" It's Douglas's largest Archibald entry so far, and he said ""whilst Karla is physically diminutive in stature, it's important that we memorialised [her in this way]"". ""And that's what I try and do with my paintings often — because we need to memorialise First Nations people en masse."" Douglas was previously a finalist for the Archibald Prize in 2020 (with a portrait of young Arrernte and Garrwa activist Dujuan Hoosan), 2019 (with a portrait of Bidjigal artist Esme Timbery), 2018 (Wiradjuri artist Uncle Roy Kennedy) and 2015 (Budjedi elder and ""Aboriginal cultural entertainer"" Uncle Max Eulo). ""It's nice in any way to honour another artist,"" Douglas told ABC News last week. ""We are a minority in terms of vocations in this country."" At the award ceremony, he said he was ""proudly represent[ing] a legion of creatives consistently dealt the rough end of the stick, unfortunately … But that may change with a change of government, perhaps"". Exhibitions for the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes will open on Saturday May 14 at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Tops Arts & Culture headlines.

51,Adnate mural immortalises 'strong-willed' Yorta Yorta women,arts-culture,"  Matt Adnate immortalises two remarkable Yorta Yorta elders as part of Shepparton mural project Yorta Yorta elder Uncle Lance James feels fortunate to have up grown up alongside his 13 brothers and sisters during an era when many First Nations children were denied that right. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains images and names of people who have died. His late mother Aunty Mary James and another pioneering community leader the late Aunty Violet Harrison have been immortalised in a mural on the Goulburn Valley Water office in Shepparton. ""It's a great location for these two giants, who raised 27 children between them — amazing, isn't it?"" Uncle Lance said. ""Aunty Violet had 13 children, my mum had 14, so that speaks for itself, to raise all of us, not to be taken away back in the days of the Stolen Generations and the removal of children."" The work by mural artist Matt Adnate is his fourth as part of the Greater Shepparton City Council and Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation's Aboriginal Street Art Project. ""To have this sort of concentration in a city like this just goes to show that you can really transform the environment,"" Adnate said. ""There's a lot of depth and meaning behind the people that I'm painting. These are really important people to the local community and it's been an absolute honour to keep coming back over all these years."" Aunty Violet and Aunty Mary were heavily involved in supporting the local Aboriginal community. Aunty Mary was a founding member for the Shepparton Aboriginal Funeral Fund and worked with police, housing and social welfare organisations, advocating for First Nations people. Other Yorta Yorta leaders already painted as part of the project include Uncle William Cooper, Pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls, Aunty Margaret Tucker, Nora 'Nanny' Charles, Private Daniel Cooper, Aunty Geraldine Briggs and Aunty Elizabeth Morgan. Both Aunty Violet and Aunty Mary were born at the Cummergunja Mission,  in 1906 and 1913 respectively. The mission was an Aboriginal reserve beside a bend in the Murray River on Yorta Yorta country in New South Wales, near the Victorian town of Barmah. In 1939, the mission was the site of the Cummeragunja Walk Off, a nine-month protest against the living conditions and management of the site. The Walk Off is described as the first mass strike of Aboriginal people in Australia. After leaving Cummergunja and moving to the neighbouring towns of Mooroopna and Shepparton, Aunty Violet and Aunty Mary went on to become founding members of Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-Operative and the Shepparton Aboriginal Keeping Place. Artist Tom Day returns to Gunditjmara Country in south-west Victoria to help paint a 30-metre-high mural of his great-grandfather and great uncles, granting them the place in history they have long been due. They advocated for better housing for their community at The Flats, a stretch of land between Shepparton and Mooroopna where Aboriginal people lived in poor conditions until the late 1950s. When Queen Elizabeth visited Shepparton in 1954, the local government installed hessian bags and curtains to block The Flats from view. Uncle Lance remembers walking across the bridge between Shepparton and Mooroopna in protest as a schoolboy, alongside his mother, Aunty Violet and their families. ""We wanted better housing. We wanted housing like everyone else,"" he said. ""We were able to get 11 buildings put up where Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-Operative started [and] that made a big difference."" Aunty Violet Harrison was a formative figure in her grandson Gary Cooper's life and he's thrilled to see her celebrated in the mural. ""I can't tell you the words to explain how I feel,"" Mr Cooper said. ""She was a pioneer growing up, she fought for justice and now she's being rewarded for it,"" he said. ""She was terrific, Nan. She was only a little lady but she was very strong-willed and very strong in her ways. ""I suppose you had to be back then. ""I think we've learned a lot from her growing up and I probably wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for her.""

56,"NSW Now: State government urges rail unions against strikes, as talks hit a snag",arts-culture,"  Sydney News: Rail unions and state government in gridlock over new train rollout timeline Here's what you need to know this morning. Talks aimed to stop industrial action have hit a snag after five weeks of enterprise agreement negotiations between rail unions and the NSW government. Minister for Employee Relations Damian Tudehope wants the New Intercity Fleet (NIF) $2 billion intercity trains to be rolled out immediately. ""I urge the unions to consider their position carefully and not to resort to extreme industrial action while the government's offer for rail workers is finalised,"" he said. ""Today I advised the leadership of the union movement that I will not support any Rail, Tram and Bus Union demands that further delay the rollout of the New Intercity Fleet."" But the Rail Tram and Bus Union's spokesman, Alex Claassens, said such a move would be unsafe. ""We want to fix these trains, we want to fix our enterprise agreement, we want to get on with our jobs operating the system for the people of NSW,"" he said. Actor Craig McLachlan will be further cross-examined today in his defamation trial. McLachlan is suing the ABC, Nine newspapers and actor Christie Whelan Browne for defamation over stories published in 2018. The articles contained allegations he indecently assaulted, harassed, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. Yesterday he was accused of repeatedly lying in his trial, after giving contradictory evidence about on-stage kissing during The Rocky Horror Show. The actor denied the accusation. Two days ago, McLachlan said he never kissed any of his female co-stars below the shoulders or arms during a bedroom scene in the show. But yesterday he admitted he once kissed Whelan Browne on the hip. He said the only reason he did so was because he dropped a fake cigarette used as a prop and had to improvise while trying to retrieve it from the bed. An investigation is underway into whether a shipment of drugs into regional New South Wales is linked to Indonesia's biggest seizure of cocaine. Fifty-four kilograms of cocaine, worth $20 million, was found near the body of a professional diver in the Port of Newcastle on Monday. Investigators believe the original shipment into Newcastle weighed 300 kilograms, with a street value of  $120 million. Only about 100 kilograms made its way into Australian waters and on Sunday, 179 kilograms of the drug was found near Merak Port on Java. A superyacht operator who lives in Cairns is set to be extradited to Sydney today to face charges of supplying and importing a commercial quantity of drugs. James Blee, 62, was arrested trying to board a flight to Singapore on Wednesday. The winner of the $100,000 Archibald Prize for portrait painting will be revealed today at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Fifty-two finalists have already been selected and their works will be on display at the gallery from Friday. The Wynne prize will also be awarded for the best landscape painting along with the Sulman Prize for the best subject painting, genre painting or mural project. Sydney artist Claus Stangl's painting of Aotearoa New Zealand filmmaker, actor and comedian Taika Waititi won the Archibald Prize's Packing Room Prize — kicking off 'Archies season' in Sydney last week.

57,"Eight months after fleeing the Taliban, Afghan refugee Nazdana steps onto the runway at Australian Fashion Week ",arts-culture,"  Proud moment for fashion designer as Afghan refugee who fled the Taliban steps onto the runway at Australian Fashion Week Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Peeking out onto the runway from backstage at Australian Fashion Week, Australian-Afghan designer Mariam Seddiq could hardly believe what she was seeing. Modelling one of her looks under the glare of the lights was 24-year-old Nazdana Bakhtiari, who only eight months ago fled from Afghanistan with her mother, escaping the Taliban takeover. ""It was incredible. I was like, 'how is this happening?'"" the Western Sydney-born designer said. ""This time last year she was there (in Afghanistan). No way in hell would she have thought she'd be doing something like this. ""A woman can't even walk out of the front door at the moment."" The pair first met when Ms Seddiq was looking for women skilled in traditional Afghan beadwork, known as mora doozi, to use in her garments. A local contact from Fairfield in Sydney's west put her in touch with Ms Bakhtiari, her mother Zakia and a friend, who had only recently arrived in the country, after leaving Kabul airport on a military evacuation flight. ""I went to their apartment and I saw their work and I knew I had to include beadwork back into my designs, so they'd have work but in an arty way,"" she said. It was during their collaboration that the idea that Ms Bakhtiari might step out of the shadows to display her handiwork came about. ""When I dropped them home after work hand sewing, (Nazdana) mentioned she might want to model for me, so she's been practising for three weeks,"" Ms Seddiq said. ""It just seemed like a dream to take it one step further."" Ms Seddiq sees her designs, a mixture of couture gowns, suits, and jewellery as way to empower women. ""It's not just because of this Afghanistan thing. A lot of women forget how strong they are and what they're capable of. So that's really important to bring it out of all walks of life,"" she said. Her show at Australian Fashion Week in Sydney featured diverse models with a range of ages, sizes, genders and ethnic backgrounds. ""It just felt like more of a real show rather than a really curated show of skinny models,"" Ms Seddiq said. The former student of Bankstown Girls High School has gained a celebrity following, with her designs worn by Orange is the New Black actor Diane Guerrero, as well as Australian music stars Iggy Azalea and Delta Goodrem. Ms Seddiq said Australia had been slow to appreciate the work of its culturally diverse designers. ""I started in LA and was getting noticed in the US before I started getting any attention back home. ""It's about time Australia embraced its brown folk. And hopefully this leads to more women breadwinners, more women bosses because it's more than fashion.""

58,Keeping up with the Kardashians: Women turning to cosmetic surgery to be 'ethnic but not too ethnic',arts-culture,"  Why new cosmetic surgery trends that 'pick and choose' from cultures raise cultural appropriation concerns Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Who wins and who loses when beauty trends celebrate cosmetically altered looks that are ethnic — but 'not too ethnic'? Growing up in Sydney, Petronie was taught to be proud of her Blackness. The message was instilled in her by her mum and dad, who are from Zambia and the Republic of the Congo, respectively. ""They were always telling me that I'm Black and I'm beautiful, and just making sure I really believed that,"" Petronie says. Though it was powerful, it still couldn't shield the 26-year-old model and influencer from pervasive western beauty norms. In 2007, when US reality TV stars the Kardashians shot to fame, Petronie was one of the millions of people around the world who began noticing physical alterations in the sisters. In particular, she watched Kim Kardashian's ""nose changes over time"". And whenever Petronie used social media filters — which tweak facial features, often for comedic or beautifying effect — she noticed that some shrank the size of her nose. By the time she was 21, Petronie decided she wanted cosmetic surgery, too. ""I wanted my nose to be a bit thinner and pushed up,"" she says. But Petronie is acutely aware that while cosmetic surgery can erase some features like a non-Caucasian nose, it can also emphasise others, like big lips or almond-shaped eyes. That cosmetic procedures allow people to capitalise on the desirability of those cultural features — while removing others — is a pop culture paradox, and it's impacting the steadily growing number of Australians who are opting for cosmetic procedures. Many are weighing up the relationship between their culture and their appearance, in the face of trends that promote a look of ethnic — but, some argue, ""not too ethnic"" — ambiguity. Adria Goldman is assistant professor of communication and digital studies at the University of Mary Washington in the US. She says the term ""Blackfishing"" describes ""an act of cultural appropriation where someone non-Black tries to present themselves as Black"". That could be through darkening their skin, adopting an Afro-centric hairstyle, or getting a more voluptuous shape, through photo editing or even butt augmentation. ""Oftentimes [it's] for profit or some other personal gain,"" she says. Blackfishing is a criticism that's been levelled at the Kardashians, and other celebrities including Australian singer Iggy Azalea, British singer Rita Ora and American singer Ariana Grande. Some accused of Blackfishing or of cultural appropriation have counter argued that in fact they are enacting cultural ""appreciation"", Dr Goldman says. But, she argues, while intent is worth considering, ultimately it's not the point. ""A person can appropriate Black culture and say that their intention was not to do harm — but appropriating Black culture does do harm,"" she says. It can reinforce ""surface level"" or ""misinformed"" ideas about Black culture. ""It's commodifying this culture with no gain to Black people."" Like Petronie, social media consultant Natasha also watched the Kardashians' appearances morph over time. Natasha is Middle Eastern-Australian and was very insecure about her appearance when she was growing up. ""I never felt like I was the pretty girl, ever. And I think that was because … I was around mostly white people,"" she says. By the end of high school, she had endured years of teasing about her looks. Yet, at the same time, reality TV was demonstrating that appearance isn't fixed. ""I started realising, oh wow, things can be changed,"" Natasha says. So at 18 years of age, Natasha, who is now 26, began cosmetic enhancement — first lip filler, then rhinoplasty or a nose job — to alter what she calls her ""ethnic nose"". But she says that modifying her cultural features has come at a cost. While she publicly, and proudly, identifies as a woman of colour, she says she's been criticised online for having ""absolutely no features that correlate with a woman of colour"" and for being ""white passing"". For Natasha, such statements diminish her personal experience. ""They don't know the torment I went through growing up,"" she says. ""I start to think it's my fault because I've changed my ethnic features. ""But it's so wrong."" Natasha says the comments also diminish the discrimination faced by her Aramaean forebears. ""My people have gone through so much persecution … and even my parents, moving to Australia [have endured] so much hardship,"" she says. The criticism levelled at those who undergo cosmetic surgery to modify their cultural features is one that philosopher and physician Yves Saint James Aquino is familiar with. He has studied the ethics of cosmetic enhancement, specifically blepharoplasty or double eyelid surgery, a procedure that is most popular in South East Asia. Dr Aquino, who is also a research fellow with the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, says people who undergo this surgery are often criticised for ""betraying their heritage"" or being ""a race traitor"". He argues it's a reductive position to take. ""Heritage and culture is more than appearance,"" he says. Dr Aquino believes that people, women specifically, ""should be able to do whatever they want with their body"". But he also believes that ""choice"" to undergo body or face modification is a concept that ""we have to interrogate"" in the context of media, peer group and broader societal pressure. ""Even if no one's pointing a gun at your head, you live through all these pressures, all these directives … [so] is that an authentic choice?"" One of those pressures is social media. Dr Aquino knows of cosmetic surgeons who report that their clients want ""to change their face based on specific [social media] filters"". He says other clients want to alter their noses because the angle of a selfie gives the illusion of an increased nose size. ""So it's a very weird, perceptual thing that's influencing their self-image … it's the way they hold their phone,"" he says. The cosmetic enhancement industry in Australia is booming. We meet the people chasing their aesthetic ideal and those jumping off the cosmetic enhancement conveyor belt. Gemma Sharp has also noticed shifts in cosmetic surgery requests. A clinical psychologist and Senior Research Fellow in the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre, Dr Sharp leads the Body Image Research Group. She says there's been a move away from a ""traditional facelift, which is used to 'rectify' ageing processes"". Rather, ""preventative"" procedures such as fillers are becoming more common among younger people. Dr Sharp says the expansion of the sorts of people having procedures is thanks to reduced costs, increased availability and the normalisation of cosmetic surgery through the media. ""People who tended to seek cosmetic procedures were more likely aged 30 and over in the past, but now we are seeing people seeking them as young as late teens and 20s."" In the last five years or so, there's been a sharp increase in the use of injectables (such as in wrinkle-reducing or lip-filling procedures) in Australia, and the Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) operation, which ""is the fastest growing cosmetic surgery in the world"", Dr Sharp says. At 2018, Australians were spending more per capita on cosmetic surgery than in the US, with anti-wrinkle (Botox) injections the most popular operation at the time. Cosmetic surgery wasn't on the mind of 14-year-old Kina when she started posting selfies on social media. For a long time, Kina, who has Indian heritage, only posted photos with filters applied to them. At first, the filters were ""cute hearts"" or ""a nice background"", she says. ""And I was like, that's lovely."" Then she realised the filters could also ""slim down my nose … make my nose look upturned … make my lips and eyes bigger [and] my face slimmer"" and ""significantly lighten my skin"". ""I looked like a white person,"" Kina says. It began to change the way she thought about herself. ""I was just like, am I not pretty otherwise? It came to the point where I could not take a photo without a filter because I would look at myself and find all these little faults."" Kina started to ask herself, ""Why can't my nose be slimmer? Why can't my lips be bigger? Why can't my face have more of a structure to it instead of being so round?"" She recognised the filters' ""toxic"" influence and today she tries to avoid them. But she's concerned that she and her peers are bombarded on social media with ideals about an ""unattainable body"". ""[The beauty ideal] is very much centred around white women having racially ambiguous features, like those big lips, the very Middle Eastern and South Asian brows and eyes, and Black bodies,"" Kina says. ""It's just very unsustainable because nobody actually looks like that."" And it sends a powerful message of inadequacy to teenagers online. ""If I went and asked younger girls around my age, 'Do you have insecurities? Do you hate anything about yourself?', so many girls will be like, 'I hate my body, I hate my face [or] how my lips look or [how] my eyes look,'"" Kina says. ""If you ask them, 'Do you want to get surgeries when you're older?' so many girls will say, 'Yes, I can't wait.'"" Kina says race, and racism, is front and centre of the problem. ""People will go, 'Oh, this part of your ethnic features? Ugly. But this part? I want this part so bad … Your nose is flat, that's gross; but your eyes, they're so pretty.'"" What do people of colour, who've often been racially vilified for their appearance, have to say about others cherry-picking their features? Dr Aquino describes this as a ""mixed race"" western beauty trend that privileges ""racial ambiguity"". ""All of a sudden, you're beautiful because you look ethnic, but not too ethnic',"" he says. ""There is a certain range where we find things to be acceptable."" Dr Goldman says there's a powerful marketing opportunity within that range. ""One of the things about the Kardashians and about racial ambiguity in general is that individuals have the ability to sit in the middle of this white and non-white [identity], reaping the benefits, while avoiding the costs."" Petronie has noticed an increase online in the presence of big hips, big lips and big bums in young women, including among white women. For her, it demonstrates an inescapable hypocrisy. ""I find it interesting because [white people] were teasing us before because Black people had big lips. ""And now that's what you want. ""When you're not Black and those are Black features — the lips and even the hair, like braids — it's cultural appropriation,"" she says. Petronie argues the act of assuming physical features or styles that are typical of a culture other than your own — full lips or full hips, or cornrows, for example — brings with it some responsibility. If you emulate Black culture, she says, ""then I want you to keep that same energy when it comes to issues that are happening within the Black community"". Stand with the Black Lives Matter movement, for example. ""Make sure that you're an ally. Don't just pick and choose what parts of our culture suit you, because Black culture is not a trend,"" Petronie says. Rokeshia Ashley, an assistant professor at Florida International University who specialises in body image and modification, wants to move on from talking about the Kardashians. She says plenty of Black women are now ""taking hold of this conversation"" and are ""also using their bodies as social capital"". She points to public figures such as model Blac Chyna, entrepreneur Jai Nice or influencer Eliza Reign as examples. Whether through modelling clothes or paid social media sponsorships, the women are creating revenue ""how they see fit"", she says. ""Although it may seem morally compromising to some, they are well within their right to govern their bodies autonomously."" Dr Ashley says rather than consider body modification — a term she uses to include cosmetic surgery as well as changes to hair or make-up — as inherently bad, we should be more ""receptive and supportive to what Black women want to do with their bodies"". Black women's bodies ""have always been governed"", whether by slavery or health institutions, or through other means, Dr Ashley says. ""Globally, with anti-Blackness, we didn't have the opportunity to be able to say, 'This is what I want to do with my body.'"" Whatever that choice is today, she supports it, so long as it can be done safely and with all the education and information at hand. Unlike some of her online critics, Natasha doesn't conflate her cosmetic procedures with her relationship to her cultural background. ""I'm very, very proud of being Middle Eastern,"" she says. And she's happy today with her slimmer nose and other cosmetic modifications, which she says have ""definitely made me more confident"". Petronie, on the other hand, decided against cosmetic surgery, and is also content with her decision. Her nose job idea was discouraged by her partner and, after considering it for a while, Petronie agreed she didn't need it. ""[I thought], you know what, I'm just going to embrace my culture [and] embrace my nose,"" she says. ""This is a Black person's nose. This is not every Black person's … but it's who I am. It's part of my history, my background. So I think I will be keeping it.""

59,"'Irreplaceable': Globally-renowned master of the yidaki, Mr Gurruwiwi, dies in Arnhem Land",arts-culture,"  Mr Gurruwiwi, globally-renowned master of the yidaki, dies in Arnhem Land Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Mr Gurruwiwi, a renowned and celebrated master of the yidaki, more commonly known as the didgeridoo, has died in Arnhem Land after a long battle with illness. He has long been considered the world’s foremost master of the yidaki, an instrument developed by the Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land, and a symbol of Aboriginal Australia. WARNING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised this article contains an image of a person who has died. Mr Gurruwiwi's family have given permission for his last name and image to be used. Mr Gurruwiwi's exact age at the time of his death was unknown, however it is believed he was in his late eighties. Zelda Gurruwiwi, Mr Gurruwiwi's daughter, said her family and the Galpu people were ""feeling sad and feeling proud"". ""He flew with the yidaki, he was travelling with the yidaki,"" she said. ""He shared that from his own heart to the world."" Ms Gurruwiwi said her father left a powerful legacy. ""We're proud of him. Outside, physical, we're sad. Inside, spiritually, bright,"" she said. ""Sharing culture, he was holding that culture, living with that culture and he was walking with it. ""It's all there, that life. You know what he said last minute to me? He said: 'My work is done.' ""He shared the love, kindness, happiness, laughter, joy, because he was living in a world that he came from."" A leader of the Dhuwa moiety Galpu clan of north-east Arnhem Land, Mr Gurruwiwi lived in Birritjimi on the Gove Peninsula, about 1,000 kilometres east of Darwin. There, in north-east Arnhem Land, Mr Gurruwiwi's father Monyu gave him the specific role as the primary custodian of the yidaki for his clan. Outside of his home, he took the yidaki, an instrument he called his ""whole life"", to the world. The sound of his yidakis has been described as being imbued with the power of lightning and thunder, and he became popularly known as a master of the instrument — a status burnished when Mr Gurruwiwi was chosen to make the yidakis for Yothu Yindi. His instruments toured with the band and have been heard in studio recordings played on mainstream radio all over the world. Mr Gurruwiwi was also known as a healer and a teacher, and those who came across him would often remark on his grand wisdom and wit, warmth and charisma, and larger than life presence. Describing him as ""irreplaceable"", Will Stubbs, the coordinator of the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre in north-east Arnhem Land, said Mr Gurruwiwi was a vital holder of knowledge. ""Mr Gurruwiwi was a true one-of-a-kind legend. He had international cult status within the world of didgeridoo players,"" he said. ""The yidaki or didgeridoo originates from here and the Galpu clan have primary responsibility for the songlines that detail that origin. As leader of that clan he vigorously promoted and defended that legacy. ""There are literally thousands of people from many overseas nations who have been welcomed into his modest family home to learn the intricacies of the instrument over the last 35 years. ""He is truly irreplaceable."" Until his death, Mr Gurruwiwi lived in dilapidated housing at Birritjimi, where homes were built in the 1970s to house the managers of a Rio Tinto mining operation. In 2020, he said his family's pleas for safer housing had gone unheard for years: ""We want people to start recognising us, hear our voices,"" he said. The year before, the Royal Australian Mint adopted a design by Mr Gurruwiwi for a $1 coin. Mr Gurruwiwi was the key consultant of the 'Yidaki: Didjeridu and the Sound of Australia' exhibition by the South Australian Museum, one of the most comprehensive projects to ever chronicle the instrument. The exhibition examined the instrument as both iconic yet, inexplicably, underappreciated by wider Australia. The South Australian Museum's head of humanities John Carty has said First Nations Australians steered the museum to Mr Gurruwiwi to advise on the exhibition. ""The only way that [the museum] could do this with any integrity was to work with the real experts, [Mr Gurruwiwi, his family]' and the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land],"" Mr Carty said in 2017. He said Mr Gurruwiwi changed the way the world saw his instrument and taught the nation more about the power and knowledge of his Yolngu people. ""[Mr Gurruwiwi] has been one of the men who has been really integral in the spread of the instrument, not only in Australia, but overseas,"" he said. ""He's more famous in Japan and Germany and overseas than he is in Australia, because he's spent his life taking the instrument ... around the world to share that knowledge and to use the instrument as a bridge between cultures."" Film-maker Ben Strunin, who made a biopic of Mr Gurruwiwi and toured with him through Europe, told The Guardian in 2017 that Mr Gurruwiwi ""deserves all the recognition of our most celebrated music stars"". The film made showcase of the yidaki master's friendship and work with Grammy award-winning musician Gotye, whose real name is Wally De Backer. Mr De Backer has paid tribute to the late clan elder, describing him to ABC Radio Darwin as ""a human of incredible spirit"". ""I feel fortunate to have spent some time with him and his family,"" he said. ""His deep commitment to music, healing and family will continue to be a source of inspiration to me, and I hope it may also be to others who look into his life and work."" Zelda Gurruwiwi said the yidaki was ""mystery, history"" to her father. ""It came itself, this nature, the instrument, and now we're living with that nature,"" she said. ""You can see trees coming, you can feel the breeze coming from north, east, west, south. ""That instrument took him far.""

61,"'The love, the hurt': What Johnny Cash sang about 'belongs to everyone'",arts-culture,"  Johnny Cash's life celebrated in Devonport premiere of musical Ring of Fire Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog ""Hello … I'm not Johnny Cash"" drawls local theatre legend Sid Sidebottom as Wendy (from costume) passes him another black shirt in the backstage hallway. In a full dress rehearsal for Ring of Fire, The Music of Johnny Cash, the former federal member for Braddon demonstrates that he can deliver the deep and low tones of the legendary American singer. But this is not a tribute show. It's a journey through Cash's life and a genderless celebration of universally loved songs, hence the play on Cash's famous opening line. ""I'm not him. No-one is playing Johnny Cash, yet we all are,"" Mr Sidebottom says, reaching for what must be the last long, black trenchcoat available in Devonport. ""In this show, there are a number of classic Johnny Cash songs sung by females. I think people will be really excited by that and you do still feel that Johnny Cash is there. ""What Johnny Cash sang about, the love, the hurt, the causes — those things belong to everyone."" The cast of six singers are joined by a seven piece on-stage band — the Smokin' Locals —  led by co-director David Turner. The singers joining Mr Sidebottom are Annette Dawes, Zac Weeks, Laura Auton, Sherry Rand and Andrew Grey. Last year Mr Sidebottom directed the Devonport Choral Society's Buddy Holly story at the same venue: Devonport's Town Hall Theatre. That show was very much led by a star turn by young singer, guitarist and actor, Ezra Shelverton. For his energetic Buddy Holly, he won the Tasmanian Theatre Award prize for Outstanding Male Lead Performance. This year it's the newly formed Cradle Coast Theatre that is staging Ring of Fire. And the experience has been a baptism of fire. They chose a show that was flexible enough to get through a COVID period. ""We've been severely affected by the pandemic. We've had to postpone the show and a majority of this cast and the band have had COVID,"" Mr Sidebottom says. ""So, it's been a long journey. A bit like Johnny Cash's story I think."" Mr Sidebottom says there's a lot of darkness in Johnny Cash's music. ""Here's a man who had great faith but also sinned greatly. He hurt a lot of people, was hurt by a lot of people,"" he says. ""I think he was always seeking redemption."" Over where the band is warming up, drummer Pete Jermy points to the official musical notation on the stand that directs his drums on the classic song Jackson. It reads: ""s**t kickin"". ""It's an apt description of the relentless, big rhythm that's in so much of this music,"" the drummer says. The singers revel in it too, belting out 30 Cash greats across the two acts of the show, often in duet and with stunning six-part harmonies on the gospel numbers. Annette Dawes has been travelling 90 minutes each way from Irish Town — after work — for each rehearsal and will do it again for each of the 10 shows between May 13 and May 28. ""I've come to appreciate Johnny Cash even more through this experience,"" Ms Dawes says. ""I love the group songs, Five Foot High and Rising, Daddy Sang Bass. They're just a heap of fun."" Co-star Laura Orton concurs: ""I love Daddy Sang Bass, especially the a capella part at the start."" ""We're all facing each other and you can just feel the music. It's really beautiful."" The show is backed by a projection of archival images from Cash's earliest days as a poor kid on an Arkansas cotton farm through his early marriage to Vivian Liberto and on to the evolution of his great love with June Carter. The power of the show is in the greatness of the songs and in the fine cast of local singers who can all ""wear black"" with aplomb when called upon. Sherry Rand, Zac Weeks and Andrew Grey are all known for regular professional gigging along the coast and know how to own the stage. The premiere performance is at the Devonport Town Hall Theatre on Friday night.

62,Craig McLachlan accused of lying while giving evidence in defamation trial ,arts-culture,"  Craig McLachlan accused of lying while giving evidence in defamation trial Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Actor Craig McLachlan has been accused of repeatedly lying in his defamation trial, after giving contradictory evidence about on-stage kissing during a production of The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan is suing the ABC and Nine Newspapers for defamation over stories from 2018 containing allegations he indecently assaulted, harassed, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. He is also suing actor Christie Whelan Browne, who made the allegations to the ABC's 7.30 program and the Sydney Morning Herald. Two days ago, McLachlan said he never kissed any of his female co-stars below the shoulders or arms during a bedroom scene in the show, but on Thursday admitted he once kissed Whelan Browne on the hip. He said the only reason he did so was because he dropped a fake cigarette used as a prop and had to improvise while trying to retrieve it from the bed. ""Because I dropped the e-cigarette and Christie saw it as well, so I jokingly kissed her on the hip while I scrambled to find the e-cigarette. It was quite a funny moment,"" he told the court. But the barrister representing the media outlets, Michael Hodge QC, argued McLachlan inappropriately touched and kissed not only Whelan Browne under the bed covers, but two other actors who were understudies during the tour. This is something McLachlan said was ""impossible"" as there wasn't enough time during the scene and he was too focused on putting the e-cigarette in a specially designed pocket under the covers. He also claimed some of the kissing sounds picked up by his microphone while under the covers were what he called ""air kisses"" and not actually on his co-star's body. ""You're making this up aren't you?"" Mr Hodge said. ""No I'm not Mr Hodge,"" McLachlan said. ""That's just a lie … a deliberate lie,"" Mr Hodge said. ""No it's not,"" McLachlan said. Later during cross-examination, the actor contradicted evidence he gave earlier this week in court about a conversation with a co-star in April 2014. On Tuesday, he denied telling the actor, who cannot be identified, that he ""couldn't wait for the bedroom scene"" while in her dressing room one night. But on Thursday, Mr Hodge showed McLachlan a 2018 affidavit he signed which stated he did say this. McLachlan then claimed he could recall mentioning the bed scene to the actor but that it was only in reference to ""corpsing"" — something which he described as actors intentionally trying to make each other laugh while on stage. ""We would routinely talk about making each other laugh or not laugh in the bed scene,"" McLachlan said. Mr Hodge then said McLachlan was just trying to ""spin"" evidence that didn't support his earlier claims. ""No I haven't,"" he said. The defamation trial is expected to run for around five weeks and will hear from 11 women who have accused McLachlan of inappropriate behaviour. All worked with him on Australian TV or theatre productions. McLachlan says the media reporting of such allegations damaged his reputation and caused him so much distress he had to be admitted into a mental health facility in 2018.

63,Designers bring lived experience to disability-friendly creations for Australian Fashion Week,arts-culture,"  Designers Carol Taylor and Jessie Sadler bring disability-friendly creations to runway for Australian Fashion Week Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For the first time in Australian Fashion Week history, a runway show has been created by and for people with disabilities, and modelled by people with disabilities. Award-winning Gold Coast artist Carol Taylor was one of two women who co-designed several ""adaptive clothing"" pieces for Fashion Week in Sydney, which were being showcased today. She and co-partner Jessie Sadler created the pieces for Brisbane-based label Christina Stephens, and the range includes clothing for people living with disabilities, spectrum disorders and who have difficulty dressing themselves. The pair said they hoped to make ""adaptive clothing"" mainstream and wanted to see the pieces displayed in major department stores. Former Sydney-based lawyer Carol Taylor was in a horrific car crash in the Blue Mountains in 2001 that severed her spinal cord and left her a quadriplegic. She said she had always been interested in fashion but after her injury, that passion turned to devastation when she could never find any clothing to suit her altered body. She decided to begin designing clothing for herself, which morphed into creating clothing for people with all kinds of disabilities and disorders. ""There are so many different considerations that adaptive clothing brings, there are so many misconceptions about designing in this space,"" she said. ""So if I'm designing for someone in a wheelchair, it's not just about designing for someone in the seated position, careful consideration has to be given to things like movement and dexterity issues. ""Temperature control, because the thermostat in the brain doesn't work the same anymore after spinal cord injury. ""Things like life-threatening pressure sores, it's also important to consider fabric type for those who suffer from arthritis or spectrum disorders because they can experience sensory issues, the list goes on."" Ms Taylor joined forces with brand founder Jessie Sadler, and together they have worked to create disability-friendly designs that can also be worn by able-bodied people. Together the pair were asked to create a number of pieces to open Australian Fashion Week on Thursday. ""It's more than just magnets and Velcro, and by showcasing at Australian Fashion Week, I believe we begin the journey of taking adapted fashion mainstream,"" Ms Taylor said. ""We want to show our designs that are thought provoking, provocative, luxurious, exciting, colourful. ""People with disabilities want to be included in the fashion conversation and have the same access to fun, colour and excitement as everybody else"" Ms Taylor said the runway collection showcased pieces close to her heart, including one item ""specifically designed for the girl that cannot stand"". ""But every other item has in-built features that are going to benefit someone with mobility, dexterity, disability issues, but could equally be worn by someone who is able-bodied."" She said another piece was prompted by wanting to give people with disabilities the same intimate moments as able-bodied people. ""Inspiration for this design came about when i was in an online conference and there was a young quadriplegic man that was to get married and his girlfriend was able bodied,"" she said. ""The boys at the end of the conference were having a bit of a laugh and joke about the wedding night coming up, and you could hear a pin drop. ""He said yeah you should know that I will never know what it's like to unwrap my bride, and for me that was a light-bulb moment. ""I thought oh my gosh, why should he be denied this intimacy, and I thought well that problem needs solving."" Ms Taylor said the clothing's point of difference was the designers having lived experience with disability themselves, with Carol a quadriplegic and Jessie's mother suffering an arm injury that led to her getting arthritis and having difficulty getting dressed. ""We are the only clothing label that has lived experience of disability at the design table,"" she said. ""There's absolutely no substitute, at the moment we have able-bodied people designing for people with disabilities. ""So this is the first time customers are going to have people with disabilities designing for people with disabilities and I think that's a critical point of difference.""

65,Bear essential: Treasured teddy rescued from outback after dad's travel photo blunder,arts-culture,"  Lost teddy bear 'Pooh' reunited with family after being lost in the outback Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A long-lost teddy has finally been reunited with his family months after being left behind in outback NSW. Gordon Wilson left his son's treasured bear 'Pooh' on a fence post along the Barrier Highway near Broken Hill in March while part way through a 5000km journey from Bowen in north Queensland to Perth in WA. Mr Wilson had been taking photos with the bear as a way of keeping himself and the family entertained. After being ""distracted by flies"" and driving off – it took hours for Mr Wilson to realise he'd left his son's prized possession more than 150km away. He decided against going back, and that's where the real adventure began. He and his wife Lois Wilson logged onto to social media and began posting on Broken Hill Facebook groups, asking if someone had seen or picked up the bear. What happened next came as a shock to the Wilsons. Their appeals for help were shared all over the internet. ""I was actually quite amazed by the reaction and how many people were following the story,"" Mr Wilson said. Grazier Mitch Rodgers was one of those interested onlookers. Determined to reunite the family with their beloved bear, he drove out from Comarto Station near Wilcannia to find Pooh where he had been left. While the plan had initially been to post him back in the mail, Mr Rodgers and Mr Wilson thought the adventure should continue. So they decided to harness the power of social media to find more people willing to travel with the bear across to the west coast. ""Mitch went to great trouble and started to share the story on social media with some great photos,"" Mr Wilson said. ""The story then took on a life of it's own and if it wasn't for Mitch it probably wouldn't have got off the ground like it did."" He said Pooh's journey garnered interested from as far afield as Scotland, where he had relatives. He said Pooh travelled 150km to Broken Hill and visited Silverton before heading south to Mildura in Victoria. ""He then received a lift from a couple to Adelaide and from there flew to Perth,"" he said. ""I'll tell you what it took off pretty quick,"" Mr Rodgers said. ""It was just good to hear that people were getting a bit of joy out of it."" 24-year-old Ben Wilson, who's had the bear since he was a baby, is still stunned that so many people dedicated their time and effort to make sure the teddy was returned. ""I thought that was it, and I was never going to get him back,"" he said. ""I'm grateful for Mitch, the Broken Hill community along with anyone and everyone who was involved,"" Ben said. Asked if Pooh would be having any more adventures anytime soon….the answer was ""unlikely"". ""He'll be staying with me until I have my first child and then when he or she gets old enough, I'll tell them the story of what happened here,"" Ben said. ""Because it's not something we're going to forget anytime soon.""

66,From Gold Coast to Turin — Sheldon Riley's Eurovision journey,arts-culture,"  Australia's Sheldon Riley may be Not The Same but his Eurovision dreams are finally coming true in Turin Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Just over two months ago, an emotional Sheldon Riley achieved his long-time dream — a trip to Italy to represent Australia at the Eurovision Song Contest. Amid cheering crowds at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, Riley — a talented 23-year-old Filipino-Australian performer best known for his work on reality TV shows like The Voice and America's Got Talent — had earned top spot in Australia Decides with his power ballad Not The Same. And yet he quickly realised that while his dramatic, dark, industrial staging had worked on the Gold Coast, he would have to dream things up again if he wanted to make his mark at Eurovision in Turin. This week, all the thinking and planning since then comes to the moment of truth for his big Eurovision adventure, when Riley steps on stage at the PalaOlimpico and tries to qualify for the final of the global music extravaganza that is watched by up to 200 million people around the world every year. ""I won't say anything bad about Australia Decides, because I won. I could have been happier, but because of COVID there was a lot of setbacks, there was a lot of rehearsals we couldn't get to, and … just COVID-wise, it meant there was only so much creative control I was able to have,"" he told ABC before flying out for the contest. ""But the performance was too dark, it was too heavy. I learned a lot from Australia Decides, I realised my song isn't a sad song, it's not a negative song and it shouldn't be a song that's too heavy and emotionally driven in a negative sense. The song has a lot of light, it has a lot of hope. ""I think it shines really brightly for a lot of people who don't have a voice and I needed to present that on stage, and the whole dark thing, it's not the right staging for the song."" Riley calls Eurovision a ""juggernaut"" of a competition. It's the world's biggest live music event, and for competitors it's not just a case of winning their national final or being named as the performer of the song for Eurovision, then resting up before turning up in the host city to do the business. ""Eurovision season"" runs for months. Italy picks its winner after a huge music festival of their own, San Remo. Many of the songs are then tweaked between winning and the contest itself — sometimes to improve the arrangement, other times to get the length of the song down to three minutes. If they don't get to that time limit or under, it can't be performed at Eurovision. The other part is what could be termed the campaign element. There is no formal advertising for Eurovision, but performers do countless interviews in their own and other countries to raise the contest's profile. And then there are the ""pre-Eurovision parties"" that have become a big part of the lead-up, as various competitors go to places like London, Spain, the Netherlands and Israel to perform concert versions of their songs in front of tightly packed, noisy crowds in nightclubs or other venues. Riley went to two parties, in London and Tel Aviv — and it was an eye-opening experience for a number of reasons. ""It's still well and truly in the Eurovision bubble. Unfortunately I lost my voice in London, which really messed me up in London and Israel Calling, but I was still so happy to be there,"" he said. ""In the end you really don't know how big Eurovision is until you go to Europe and see how much people obsess over the whole thing. So it was nice to get an experience and a kind of taste test for what's coming."" The contest itself has changed markedly in recent years — with the proliferation of reality TV singing shows, a lot of entrants are either chosen via a reality show format, or are experienced in those type of shows. Among Australia's Eurovision entrants since 2015 have been inaugural Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian and 2006 runner-up Jessica Mauboy, and X-Factor winners Dami Im and Isaiah Firebrace. Now it's Riley, who has used shows in Australia and the United States to showcase his performing vision, which mixes big songs with a flamboyant image, striking fashion, jewellery and masks. He wrote his song for Eurovision years ago as a message to his younger self about the struggles of dealing with Asperger's Syndrome and feeling ""not the same"" in his appearance, his experience and how he related to the world. Riley's voice, both powerful and capable of fragility, has driven many a reality TV run, but on the Eurovision stage it packs a real punch. But is his grounding in reality TV on two continents an advantage for Eurovision? Not really, he says. ""I think a lot of people are comparing my experiences from The Voice — quite naturally — with all the reality TV I've done to Eurovision, [but] nothing quite has been able to prepare me for how big Eurovision actually is,"" he said. ""In some ways it's very similar to reality TV, but in most ways it's completely different. ""I mean, I've been prepping this for years and years — I've wanted this for such a long time. But this is the most unexpected show, you never know what is going to happen."" He describes Not the Same as ""the hardest song I've ever had to sing"", part of the reason he didn't want it as a Eurovision song in the first place. Eurovision was watched by 183 million viewers in 2021. Here's how you can watch it this year. ""I mean I've learned the song when I was 15, I feel like I know it, it hasn't really changed much since I wrote it. But it's also the hardest song I've ever had to sing — it's such a massive sing,"" he said. ""I think it's the only thing I'm kind of worried about, which is crazy because I've never had to worry about my voice — I've always just kind of trusted it would be OK. ""It's the only thing I'm really worried about, is getting the vocal perfect. It's not like the Eurovision we remember from five or 10 years ago, where it was all about how fun and exciting it was. ""[Now] everyone's a Eurovision expert, especially because of all these reality shows — everyone knows what good singing is, and everyone knows what a f***-up is. ""There's nowhere to hide on this stage, there's no autotune, there's no pre-record, it's just a massive song to sing."" Riley describes Not The Same as ""quite the storytelling song"". ""I wanted to capture little moments that people can rewatch and remember,"" he said. ""I don't want to do the same thing as everyone else. The outfit will be the statement piece of this performance in terms of what's visually happening. ""It's being made by Alin Le'Kal, who's a very incredible designer that I'm very honoured to work with. The dress weighs 40-plus kilos, the outfit … we're practising with sandbags to move around. ""I think it's about 180,000 crystals the outfit is covered in, and lots and lots of feathers."" Member of the Australian delegation — and director of SBS production partner Blink TV — Paul Clarke explains the challenges of a famous staging from 2019. ""When we first designed Kate Miller-Heidke's dress it looked beautiful, but it weighed about 25 kilograms and she couldn't climb the poles she was on in the dress. So it needed a major refurb,"" he said. ""We're not after quite as much [movement] of Sheldon, and he's actually quite a powerful young man — he's very strong."" Rehearsals at Eurovision are designed to get the artists used to the stage, and performing the song, but more to help coordinate movement on stage and the camera angles and effects used to create the visual performance. It's a reminder that although the contest has a live audience — which brings fans together from all around the world and is integral to the atmosphere of the occasion — this is, in the end, a very big TV show. Under a new agreement this year, first rehearsals at Eurovision are closed to press and fan media — causing some consternation — with exclusive clips and backstage chat released on TikTok. The first glimpse was frustratingly brief. There was the dress — white, not black, as at Australia Decides. There were steps of some sort and that was about all you could see. Backstage, Sheldon walked back afterwards, telling the camera: ""That was insane — I mean no-one should have to sing that song three times [in one rehearsal], right? Jesus."" ""I'm so grateful — I still can't believe I'm doing this."" Sacha Jean-Baptiste is the creative director for Australia's three-minute presentation to the world in Turin. She is something of a Eurovision-whisperer, having designed stagings for a number of big entries at the contest. Keep up with all the latest news from the Eurovision Song Contest, including: None of the entries she has worked on have yet won the contest, but that's not the point. She gets the vision part of Eurovision — and one of her creations from last year particularly caught the eye, and led to some ideas from Australia's organisers. ""When you think about what's possible there — Duncan [Laurence], the previous winner from the Netherlands, was literally sitting at a piano and he won Eurovision with just a huge orb behind him, an enormous light. Just the power of it and the simplicity of it worked,"" Clarke said. ""We've got a lot of lights at our disposal and I think one of the key performances for me, which was last year was Gjon's Tears from Switzerland [designed by Jean-Baptiste]. That was basically taking someone who was more introverted and taking them to a huge audience. ""Just the way that that was conceived was I thought really well done — it was like an internal monologue. I loved it, and there was a really simple set that went with that. ""In some ways, that's our model."" The accredited media have since seen the second rehearsals, and clips have gone up showing a bit more of the action. Despite what Clarke said about Riley's strength, there is a challenge here — the physical challenge of singing one of the two or three most demanding songs in the contest while walking at least 40 kilograms worth of outfit up a staircase. If he was emotionally drained after Australia Decides, Riley might be physically spent after three sets of rehearsals, last night's jury performance (which will determine the jury vote but won't be broadcast) and tomorrow's semi-final — and then if all goes well, a repeat of jury final, dress rehearsal and the grand final on Sunday morning our time. There is, of course, an elephant in the room in Turin — the presence of Ukraine and Kalush Orchestra with their entry, Stefania, which is the hot favourite to win for reasons including but not limited to the song and its performance. Eurovision is supposed to be non-political, all about the songs and the entertainment. But it's hard to avoid it in reality — when, for example, the Portuguese entry in 1974 was the signal for the beginning of a military coup. Even with previous Ukrainian entries — like Verka Serduchka's famous glam-stomp, Dancing Lasha Tumbai, which sounded suspiciously like ""Russia goodbye"" when sung; or 2016 winner 1944 by Jamala, a powerful vocal performance of a song about Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin's mass deportation in 1944 of the ethnic Tatar population from Crimea. The spotlight at this year's Eurovision Song Contest is firmly on Ukraine's entry, with Kalush Orchestra strong favourites as their country continues to fight an invasion from Russia, so that raises the question of who will host the contest in 2023 if they win. This year's song is a folk-rap number inspired by one of the band's grandmothers, but it will be performed as the eyes of the world and media are focused on their homeland, and its invasion by Russian forces. When Kalush Orchestra took to the stage for the first semi-final on Tuesday night local time, they received a standing ovation before and after their performance. Unsurprisingly, they qualified for the final. With half the scores for Sunday's final made up of the televote by the European — and Australian — public, it is not hard to imagine a big chunk of those votes being given to Ukraine as a show of support for the country and not just the song. And Sheldon Riley is OK with that — he would even welcome it. ""Eurovision completely saved my life, it was such a dark time for me, I think this contest brought me so much love and so much hope, I would love to see Ukraine win this competition, I think they deserve it, I think they need this hope,"" he told the gathered fan and legacy press in Turin. Although, he doesn't think the song is the best in the contest, stating his preference for Cornelia Jakobs's heartbreak hit Hold Me Closer for Sweden. Riley has been asked both before and after landing in Turin about the moment his emotions spilled over on stage at the Gold Coast for Australia Decides, and whether he thinks there could be a similar moment at the PalaOlimpico. ""The thing I think I really want to make clear to everybody is I am someone in Australia who has never been recognised or respected as a legitimate artist or a musician,"" he said. ""[But] in that moment I was performing to a room full of people that I didn't need to explain myself to, singing a song that I wrote very personally at 15 years old, in a very emotional sense of a competition I've wanted to do for years and years and years. ""At the actual Eurovision it will be emotionally driven, but I'm going to be really strong. I've realised that I've had my moment at Australia Decides that was so powerful for me, but this song isn't for me anymore, it's for other people as well. ""I'm excited to go out there and be strong for people who need to, or want to, hear my message."" Riley's big Eurovision adventure has taken him from reality TV to the ""Olympics of singing"". Regardless of the result, it's clear that it's lived up to his hopes. ""[What I'm hoping for], it's already happening, being able to speak about my music, about my fashion, about my art and have people see what I do,"" he said. And if he's the one who gets to stand on the stage and sing his song for a second time on Sunday morning Australian time, then everyone will get to see what he does.

67,Colin Firth stars in a straightforward retelling of a real military strategy involving a dead body,arts-culture,"  Operation Mincemeat stars Colin Firth in a straightforward retelling of a WWII strategy to trick Nazis with a decoy corpse Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It might sound like the title for a gory, straight-to-video action movie, but Operation Mincemeat was a real World War II strategy – a secret Allied scheme to deceive the Nazis by dropping a corpse carrying fake military plans into enemy terrain, in the hopes that it might divert Hitler's forces from the real invasion planned for Sicily. Despite the absurdist potential of a story involving a reluctantly heroic stiff, this version of the event, from British filmmaker John Madden (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel; Shakespeare in Love), is an earnest and tastefully mounted dramatic thriller starring a cast of plummy thespians, including not one but two erstwhile Mr Darcys, in Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen (Pride and Prejudice). At this point, these movies are starting to feel suspiciously like parodies of cinema for an older audience. It's 1943 and – for those who haven't been paying attention for the last 75 years – the war is at a stalemate. Allied forces are plotting a crucial invasion of Sicily, but in order to divert attention from the operation and give their troops the best chance at success, they're determined to leak information to Nazi intelligence about a bogus campaign launching in Greece. The plan is the remit of the Twenty Committee, a secret cabal of British intelligence strategists dominated by the steely John Godfrey (Jason Isaacs), who run a hidden war in the shadows where – as the film's narrator hilariously informs us – ""the truth is protected by a bodyguard of lies"". The Committee's ranks include one Ian Fleming (Emma.'s Johnny Flynn, yet another Austen movie alumni), a young naval intelligence officer who refers to Godfrey as 'M' because he reminds him of his mother's authority. Among the other starchy, stiff-upper-lip caricatures, there's an officer named Bentley Purchase (Paul Ritter). Presumably, Basil Exposition is somewhere just out of frame. The corpse drop is the brainchild of Firth's intelligence officer Ewen Montagu, a middle-aged judge who family and friends believe to be serving as a naval commander. His plan has committee support in Macfadyen's agent Charles Cholmondeley, wily administrator Hester Leggett (Penelope Wilton), and ambitious secretary Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald), who agrees to pose as the dead man's sweetheart in exchange for a seat at the table. Together they set out to find a cadaver that might convincingly pass as a deceased Royal Air Force pilot. It's a plan that just might be crazy enough to work: the corpse will wash ashore in Spain carrying not-so-secret plans concerning an Allied attack on Greece, while a network of double agents will ensure the fake intel finds its way to Berlin. Not since Weekend at Bernie's has a stiff played such a pivotal role in the outcome of history. In Madden's version of the story, the committee selects the corpse of a vagrant (portrayed in flashback by Lorne MacFadyen) who drank himself to death on rat poison. There's debate about the real-life identity of the body the British used: some accounts suggest it was a deceased navy man, while Montagu himself said the corpse was ""a bit of a ne'er-do-well, and that the only worthwhile thing that he ever did, he did after his death"". Charming. Grisly as the scenario is, the film's most lively moments arrive via a brief passage of pitch-black humour, as photographers attempt to pose the dead body for an ID photo – with predictably unsuccessful results. Made up to look like a freshly drowned pilot, the newly monikered Acting Major William ""Bill"" Martin is packed on ice, bound for the Spanish coast. As Fleming would later put it: you only live twice. In order to tease this out to feature length, Madden and screenwriter Michelle Ashford (Masters of Sex), adapting the book by historian Ben Macintyre, fashion a tale of mild dramatic intrigue, with details of the characters' personal lives supplying emotional texture while the fate of the military operation hangs in the balance. (Seven-decade-old spoiler alert: it was a success.) There's some enjoyable attention to detail in the elaborate fabrication of the pilot's identity, with a running gag about the overripe dialogue in the soldier's fake letters that plays off the idea that everyone on the intelligence staff appears to be writing a spy novel. ""My God, who isn't writing a novel?"" says an exasperated Montagu, after yet another spook declares his intention to turn his exploits into fiction. And that's even before we get to Fleming, for whom the movie at times resembles an origin story: a visit to the intelligence department's 'Q' branch, for example, sees the future Bond scribe marvelling at a military issue wristwatch equipped with a miniature buzz-saw – catnip for 007 fans familiar with the author's war history. Operation Mincemeat is polite and polished stuff, content to stick to a predictable narrative and let history's stranger-than-fiction details supply the personality. Madden and cinematographer Sebastian Blenkov (Their Finest) shoot in anamorphic wide-screen for that old-school feel, delivering the kind of war movie your grandpa would love (that's a compliment, especially in an era where too many films resemble over-lit television shows). The film is stacked with fascinating details, but Madden can't always overcome the predictability of a narrative that might have come alive in the hands of a more daring filmmaker. A romantic triangle between Macfadyen, Firth and Macdonald, meanwhile, doesn't catch fire despite the actors' charms – and Firth, reliable as ever, and Macdonald, a long-underrated trouper, are both very good here. Given the premise, the movie could have been a little more strange, even funny: in one scene, a British officer mentions German General Jodl – pronounced ""yodel"" – and the moment practically begs for a cameo by Mel Brooks in full Sound of Music regalia. Comic treatment of the material isn't unprecedented either: back in the 50s, Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe's BBC radio troupe The Goon Show staged a parodic account of Operation Mincemeat in The Man Who Never Was, based on the book of the same name that also inspired the 1956 movie version (that film's deadpan line, ""Every body belongs to somebody,"" goes unmatched here). If Operation Mincemeat was already grist for the satirical mill in 1953, less than a decade after the war, it begs the reasonable question as to why this straightforward adaptation needs to exist at all, all these years later. The answer, of course, is obvious. Movies about quirky, feel-good episodes or stirring, patriotic victories in Britain's past are uncomplicated by the nation's more chequered 20th-century history, not to mention its Brexit-addled present; they're perfect for aging audiences who don't want to feel challenged or uncomfortable in the cinema. The fact that these audiences are now baby boomers looking back to their parents' stories of unambiguous heroism points to a curious retreat into familiarity. Maybe this is how nostalgia wins. Operation Mincemeat is in cinemas now. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

68,"A woman shopping for a gun, a doctor doing the unthinkable: The thrillers broaching a dark topic",arts-culture,"  Debra Oswald, Jane Caro and Robert Lukins explore extreme responses to domestic abuse in new thrillers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Jane Caro's new book begins with a woman shopping for a gun. In The Mother, Caro's first novel for adults, we meet 50-something-year-old Miriam Duffy, a successful real estate business owner and grandmother of two. Miriam, recently widowed, is not someone you'd expect to find contemplating a glass cabinet full of lethal weapons. At first, she tells the man behind the counter that she's ""just looking"", but the licence in her handbag reveals a different story — she's here to buy. This moment finds an echo in a handful of new novels in which women are faced with equally stark choices. In Debra Oswald's book, The Family Doctor, a woman stands staring at a syringe whose contents could kill the patient she is attending to. In Robert Lukins' Loveland, a woman watches a man pick up a knife, and knows how it will end. Compulsively readable yet unsettling, they raise a difficult question: what happens when the law fails to protect women from violent men? ""It's always interesting to see new trends emerge in writing, and these Australian authors certainly seem to have revenge on their minds right now,"" says Claire Nichols, host of ABC RN's The Book Show. ""These books forced me to consider what I would do in a hopeless situation. There's a vicarious thrill in seeing these women take matters into their own hands, but their actions obviously throw up a whole new set of ethical questions for the reader to consider."" When Caro decided to write The Mother, she turned to Annabelle Daniel, the CEO of Women's Community Shelters, for advice. Daniel sent her the transcript of the judgement of Simon Gittany, convicted for the horrific murder of his partner, Lisa Harnum, in 2013. Daniel had told Caro that this was the best summing up of coercive control she had ever read. ""The judge really talked about how the violence escalates, how the abuse escalated,"" Caro told The Book Show. ""It gave me a trajectory of how to do the drip, drip, drip, that builds the tension; that mounting fear that both Miriam and the reader, hopefully, feel."" In The Mother's opening pages, Miriam buys a Smith and Wesson nine-millimetre gun, and Caro spends the first half of her book showing us why. We are introduced to Miriam's youngest daughter, Ali, as ""the difficult one"". When Ali marries Nick, Miriam is initially relieved — her new son-in-law seems to dote on his wife. But then Ali begins to withdraw from her family and career, and Miriam, still grieving the loss of her husband Pete, can't quite put her finger on why. Caro drew on extensive research to paint a compelling and subtle portrait of coercive control as it develops. Nick doesn't turn violent right away, but the psychological and emotional manipulation he deploys is almost more terrifying because it causes Ali, and then Miriam, to doubt their own judgement. ""It's undetectable, hard to explain,"" says Caro. ""When you tell someone what happens, it either sounds ridiculous, like you must be exaggerating, or not bad enough to be a problem."" Caro wanted to convey how this can lead victims to remain silent. Especially if they discover their partner is surveilling them, and many do, it only ratchets up the fear and isolation. ""When it's most likely to escalate into violence is in fact when the women try to escape or make attempts to reinstate some sort of independence and freedom. That's when coercive control can become something deadly."" Without lived experience of such a situation, Caro was careful about whose perspective she presented. She wanted ""someone who was observing this happening, rather than someone to whom it was happening"". ""I wanted [Miriam], in a way, to represent us, because most of us, fortunately, we're not necessarily in a relationship like that, but we may watch it from outside, even if all we do is read the headlines … ""I wanted her feelings, terrors, dilemmas, struggles with both disbelief and belief, to mirror ours, so we could experience it vicariously through the novel and through her."" Debra Oswald too chose to centre the perspective of a bystander in The Family Doctor. Her opening pages could have come from a newspaper article, a scene in which a woman and her children have been murdered by her estranged partner. Stacey's body and those of her children are discovered by her oldest friend, Paula. They've been living with Paula for six months, hiding from Stacey's abusive ex, Matt. It is Paula, the family doctor of the title, who witnesses Matt kill himself after having murdered his family. Long after her home became a crime scene, Paula keeps circling that moment, wondering what signs she missed, and what she might have done to prevent the tragedy. ""It's a pang of responsibility that many of us feel about friends we know who've been in bad situations,"" says Oswald. ""Both Paula and Anita, her friend, feel this. They spend a lot of time after the deaths thinking, 'Should we have known? Should we have intervened?'"" When Paula encounters another woman who is clearly being abused by her partner, the question goes from hypothetical to practical. And in answering the question, Oswald manages to subvert notions of what a thriller can be. ""It's not a puzzle book. It's not a mystery to be solved,"" Oswald told The Book Show. Instead, her novel's relentless pace comes from the suspense of whether Paula and Anita will do the unthinkable, and how their own relationship will hold up under the strain of those choices. ""I kind of enjoyed the idea of the challenge – can I hold people with a forward momentum rather than a puzzle?"" ""They're just human beings with flaws and beauty inside them, who are stumbling around in the world, trying to do the right thing, and sometimes making a mess of it."" Robert Lukins wasn't thinking of plot points or big reveals when he started writing the manuscript that would become Loveland. In fact, it was never intended to be a novel — instead he described it as an ""elongated thought exercise"" and a ""solo counselling session"". ""I talked to my male friends, and everyone shakes their heads and talks about how terrible [toxic masculinity and gendered violence] is, but it's always something that is happening somewhere else; it's other men, it's imagined men, somewhere in society that we don't know anything about. It's never us, it's never our friends, it's never our family — but it is. This is us,"" says Lukins. The first version of Loveland was a story in which he interrogated his male characters. He wrote about their upbringing, the family relationships, the lives they lead, anything that could explain why they became violent and controlling. Then he got to the end and, unconvinced, started over again … and again. After six drafts, Lukins realised he couldn't make it work. ""I hit this brick wall because in the end with these men, I found plenty of reasons and plenty of excuses, but no justification obviously,"" Lukins told The Bookshelf. Having lived with these characters for so long, he started to reconsider his role as the author and whose voice and perspective he was privileging. When he chose to centre his story on grandmother and granddaughter May and Casey, he found a way to tell a story about how women live with — and survive — abusive men. ""It became a conscious, punitive act by me to push these men's experiences outside the sphere of the novel,"" says Lukins. ""The men in this story are present through their actions and present through their culpability. But ultimately, this is a novel of the experiences of these women and how they exist."" Kate Evans, co-host of The Bookshelf found herself thinking about how crime fiction can act as commentary on violence, justice and the law. ""It also has a reputation for providing resolution of some sort, if only narrative resolution,"" she says. ""But these novels are interesting in their discomfort: what does it mean to add vigilantism to the mix, especially if it seems justified? Where does it place us as readers, if we thrill to the idea of social-justice revenge? Are we then reading with one eye closed, squinting?"" In each of the novels, the women reach a point where there's seemingly nowhere left to run, and have to consider meeting violence with violence. As a doctor, Paula sees it as her job to ""protect the vulnerable little bodies of the children and women who come seeking her help"", says Oswald. Haunted still by the murder of her friend Stacey, Paula sees few other options. ""I hasten to add, I'm not advocating murder as a kind of transgressive daydream, that moment to channel our rage momentarily into 'What if we just killed one of these guys before he could hurt anybody?' Instead, I think it's about playing 'What if?' with that idea,"" she adds. ""That's what fiction can do, that non-fiction can't do … It's a way of saying, this is the level of desperation we are talking about, that under the right circumstances, a kind of perfect storm of trauma, a sequence of events might push a person who would normally never cross the line to cross the line."" For Lukins, it was never about writing revenge fiction. ""Revenge implies a choice. These are specific acts of survival. These characters have been placed in situations where all of their choices have been taken from them,"" he says. Connecting generations by structuring the novel around parallel timelines – May in the present and Casey in the 1950s – Lukins is also able to chart the cost of violence, which he describes as causing ""damage in all directions"". ""When the characters of my novel are forced to take action, it takes a huge toll on them, and it's one that they might never recover from."" Caro doesn't offer easy solutions — she says she has none. But that isn't why she wrote this book. ""I think that fiction takes the reader into compassion rather than judgement,"" she says. ""I really wanted us to stop having cliched judgements and views about women who find themselves in these terribly abusive relationships."" Caro is referring to questions she's heard when a domestic abuse news story breaks, questions like, ""Why didn't she just leave? Why did she keep the children from him? Why was she attracted to a man like that?"" ""I think novels take us out of our head and into our heart and our gut, so we don't judge Miriam and Alison, instead we feel [for them],"" says Caro. For Oswald, writing The Family Doctor was a way to transmute some of the deep anger she felt as she read story after story in the news about women and their children being assaulted. ""I wanted to wield that rage to other more positive, beautiful things, like the urge to protect people and the power of female friendship, and find a way to tell a story that would harness both those sorts of powerful forces."" Lukins, who set out to confront his own culpability, says writing the novel left him in no doubt that he — and everyone else — was complicit in gendered violence. He wants to see ""real-world change"" — significant legal reforms and improved financial support for survivors — and he's wary of anything less tangible. ""Maybe it's comforting in a way to read an article or a novel and then you feel like you've sort of reached a place of better understanding, but if nothing changes, then ultimately it's just an exercise in making ourselves feel better,"" he says. ""I suppose there's nothing wrong with starting a conversation, but if that conversation never goes anywhere, then I think it can do more harm than good.""

69,Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love?,arts-culture,"  Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The ""36 questions of love"" have taken the dating world by storm. First published in 1997 as part of scientific research into relationships, the 36 questions of love gained global popularity through Mandy Len Catron's viral 2015 New York Times essay ""To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This"". In that essay, she outlines how she used the 36 questions with a university acquaintance on a casual night out. The result was the two fell in love, not dissimilar to two research participants who took part in the study back in 1997. In the publishing of that essay, a phenomenon was born. Social media, dating websites, dating coaches and bloggers were posting, writing or discussing the 36 questions of love — often framing these questions as a surefire method to find love — backed by science. As people attempted the 36 questions of love during dates, it became clear the 36 questions typically did not result in people falling in love. The 36 questions are three sets of 12 questions. Each set is designed to increase the amount of information a person discloses about themselves to a stranger. Not only does each set of questions increase the amount each person must disclose, but within each set, the questions increase the level of disclosure as they progress. For example, one question in the first set includes ""For what in your life do you feel most grateful?"" The second set includes questions such as ""What is your most treasured memory?"" The final set, which requires the greatest disclosure, includes questions such as ""When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?"". To answer this, one needs to go back to the original paper published by well-known relationships researcher Arthur Aron and colleagues. The research aim was to determine if progressively increasing disclosure increases closeness between two strangers. The research was not designed to test whether the questions lead to love. Instead of upskilling women to cope with the harm they risk in dating men, the self-help industry should focus on male behaviour. Across three studies, Aron and colleagues found support for the idea that a gradual increase in disclosure between strangers is related to an increase in closeness immediately after the experiment. The original research never measured whether people developed feelings of love directly after the experiment or in the future. However, the final study did a brief follow-up with most matched pairs of participants. Seven weeks after participating in the study, it was found 57 per cent of the matched pairs had a follow-up conversation, 35 per cent did something together (no more details were provided), and 37 per cent went on to sit together in class. But again, none of these findings have anything to do with people finding love and going on to have a long-term relationship. If indeed the 36 questions helped Mandy Len Canton find love, that is a positive thing. However, for the dating world to generalise about the love-generating properties of the 36 questions on the basis of one popularised case speaks to how pop culture can heavily misconstrue science. Those of us who study how people fall in love and what makes for a lasting relationship know there are many ingredients that go into making a relationship work. Some of these include: the importance people place on what they want in the ideal partner people's similarities and differences people's history of past relationships styles of dealing with conflict ability to support and respond to a partner in stressful times the alignment of partners' beliefs, values and goals each person's level of commitment and the ability to regulate emotions (and these are just some of the factors). The point of the research conducted by Aron and his colleagues is self-disclosure and enhancing closeness are two factors that matter within the larger scheme of factors. The other important point is the 36 questions provide a structured way to engage in self-disclosure. Research has shown relationships can falter when people disclose too much about themselves early on in the dating process. When people do not know each other well, it can be overwhelming for a person to hear very intimate and personal details about another. They may not know how to respond to the disclosure, or feel uncomfortable themselves. This can result in the person who disclosed coming away from the interaction feeling invalidated and vulnerable. On the other hand, when a person feels their partner responds to their disclosures and vulnerabilities, relationship intimacy is enhanced. But it is a high bar to set early in a relationship to expect a partner to respond appropriately to another who discloses highly personal information about oneself. Generally speaking, over-disclosure in the early stages of relationships can be problematic, especially for those who are anxious about their relationships. So taking a gradual and measured approach to self-disclosure and ensuring each partner has the opportunity to disclose at a comfortable pace is very important. The 36 questions are unlikely to be a ""surefire"" way to find love, but they can help people understand the importance of taking a gradual approach to self-disclosure. Finding love doesn't have to be a race. Gery Karantzas is an associate professor in social psychology / relationship science at Deakin University. This piece first appeared on The Conversation.

70,Craig McLachlan admits in court kissing actor who later accused him of sexual harassment,arts-culture,"  Craig McLachlan admits in court kissing actor who later accused him of sexual harassment Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Actor Craig McLachlan has told a Sydney court that while backstage during a 2014 theatre production he kissed an actor who has since accused him of sexual harassment. McLachlan made the admission during cross-examination in his defamation trial against the ABC and Fairfax Media over stories published in 2018. The stories contained allegations he indecently assaulted, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 tour of The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan is also suing actor Christie Whelan Browne who made the allegations to the ABC's 7.30 program and the Sydney Morning Herald, which is now owned by Nine Entertainment Co. He has so far denied all allegations in court but on Wednesday under questioning by the media organisation's barrister, Michael Hodge QC, he accepted he did kiss actor Erika Heynatz in her dressing room before a show in Melbourne. He said he had been in his own dressing room with his long-time partner Vanessa Scammell before he told her he was going to ""check up on Erika"". He said he knocked on Heynatz's door, she told him to come in and he then told her to ""look at me"". ""She did and I kissed her."" ""I said words to the effect of 'I can't stop thinking about you' .... I spun back on my heel... and said 'I think I might be falling love with you'."" Earlier on Wednesday McLachlan broke down on the stand and revealed he was admitted to a mental health facility after the stories were published. McLachlan, who has enjoyed a long and successful acting career in Australia, told the court the reports damaged his reputation and caused him so much social anxiety he feared ever leaving his house. He said for a long time his only social activity was shopping for his elderly mother while wearing a disguise. ""You are fearful to ever step outside … you feel absolutely powerless against it,"" he said. ""I have been to a restaurant once in four and a half years."" He said on one occasion when he was wearing a disguise while shopping in Coles his hat fell off and a nearby customer recoiled in fear when she identified him. ""[The] woman grabbed her children and reigned them in … looking at me in disgust, it was very, very difficult to reconcile,"" the 56-year-old said. McLachlan gave evidence that immediately after the stories were aired on January 8, 2018 his cousin came and stayed with him as he was worried he would ""do something stupid"" and by the end of the year the actor had to be admitted into a mental health facility. He also explained it was too upsetting to read and watch the stories when they went live and Ms Scammell had to read them to him days later. The Sydney Morning Herald put McLachlan on the front cover of their January 8 edition and a double-page spread led with the headline: ""Manipulative, a predator: McLachlan stands accused"", the court heard. ""When the news broke … and it was revealed to me that these allegations had been made by my friends, it was just too difficult quite frankly to read the article on the day,"" he said. ""The realisation that my friends who 'goosed me', poked me, laughed with me and sat on my lap for almost eight months, [who] stuck their fingers up my nose, shared their lives with me, were making these allegations …"" McLachlan said before breaking down. On Tuesday the former Neighbours star told the jury the cast of the Rocky Horror Show often played gags or ""schticks"" on each other and said Whelan Browne often 'goosed' people – which he described as someone using their fingers to poke someone else between the buttocks. The trial is expected to hear from 11 women who worked with McLachlan on the Rocky Horror Show and TV shows including The Doctor Blake Mysteries about inappropriate touching or comments by the actor. On Wednesday morning his lawyer Kieran Smark SC outlined the dozens of allegations made by the women, all of which McLachlan emphatically denied. Some accusations include that he touched the genitals of Whelan Browne during a bedroom scene in the Rocky Horror Show, he exposed himself to many of the cast members and he threatened to ""end"" one actor who complained about him kissing her without consent.

71,Eurovision 2022 has kicked off. Here's who is competing and how to watch in Australia,arts-culture,"  Eurovision 2022 has kicked off with Ukraine tipped to win. Here's who is competing and how to watch in Australia Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Eurovision Song Contest semi-finals kicked off early on Wednesday morning, and there's still an entire weekend filled with musical extravaganza ahead of us. With last year's event attracting the eyeballs of 183 million viewers, the world's largest live music event is set to make some big waves this year. To help you brush up on the facts: here's everything you need to know about Eurovision 2022. SBS will broadcast Eurovision. The network will exclusively cover the events on SBS and SBS On Demand from May 11 to 15. Prime-time broadcasts will air on Friday May 13 and Saturday May 14 at 8:30pm, and Sunday May 15 at 7:30pm. The ABC will be live blogging the grand final on Sunday from 4:30am AEST. Sheldon Riley will fly the flag for Australia this year. The 23-year-old, who grew up on the Gold Coast, sealed his spot on the plane to Turin with his ballad Not the Same. Riley has developed a large following through performances on The Voice in 2018 and 2019 and America's Got Talent in 2020. To qualify for the Eurovision song competition, you have to be part of the EBU. SBS is part of the EBU and has been broadcasting the show since 1983. Australia made its Eurovision debut in 2015 when, as part of celebrations for the contest's 60th anniversary, it was invited to enter the competition. For now, the country has secured a Eurovision spot until 2023. The country with the most votes wins the competition and gets to host it the next year. Because of the time difference, if Australia wins, then it must nominate a European co-host which will stage the competition on its behalf. Last year, Italian rock group Måneskin was crowned the Eurovision winner in Rotterdam with their song Zitti E Buoni, which in English translates to Shut Up and Behave. The Italian band won the Eurovision Song Contest with 524 points, 25 points ahead of runners-up from France. Australia's Montaigne finished 14th in last year's semi-final. For obvious reasons the EBU in February announced that no Russian act would participate in this year's contest. Ukraine's act, folk rap group Kalush Orchestra, is overwhelmingly tipped to win, rising to the top of the winning odds following Russia's invasion earlier this year. The six members of the musical act have received special permission to leave Ukraine during the conflict in their country. Most Ukrainian men of military age are currently required to stay in order to help defend their nation. Kalush Orchestra's song, Stefania, will be sung in Ukrainian. The translated lyrics include the line: ""I'll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed."" Ukraine is the favourite to win this year's contest but Italy, the United Kingdom and Sweden are in second, third and fourth place, respectively. It's a glitzy, sometimes eccentric, often weird and wonderful song competition organised annually by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Keep up with all the latest news from the Eurovision Song Contest, including: The participants are predominantly European, but this year, 40 countries across the globe have entered the international song contest. Eurovision has public broadcasters from each country send a representative to perform an original song to compete for the coveted title of Eurovision champion. It kicked off in 1956 as the brainchild of Marcel Bezençon of the EBU, in part as an attempt to unite Europeans following World War II, and it was also designed to test the limits of live television broadcast technology. In 2020, the competition was cancelled for the first time in its more-than-60-year history due to the pandemic. However, it's been recognised by Guinness World Records as one of the longest-running annual TV music competitions in the world. And this year the Italian city of Turin is hosting. Pop group ABBA claimed victory for Sweden in 1974. Celine Dion claimed the title for Switzerland in 1988. Yes, she's from Canada and, no, singers don't have to be from the country they're representing. Yeah, it doesn't really make sense. But just go with it. Famous Australian Olivia Newton-John was chosen as the United Kingdom’s singer in 1974, finishing in fourth place. Ireland takes the Eurovision crown, with seven wins. Coming in second, is Sweden which has won Eurovision six times, while the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France, and the Netherlands have won five times. ABBA's legendary hit Waterloo. The 1974 global hit, which rocketed the band to stardom, was recently named the greatest Eurovision song of all time by BBC viewers.

72,"There used to be hundreds of 'uniquely Australian' B&S balls across the country, but they're vanishing. Here's why",arts-culture,"  B&S balls in decline as liquor licensing and safety regulations increase costs for organisers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Ask anyone who has ever been to a Bachelors and Spinsters Ball (B&S) and a few images that may come to mind include getting dressed up, getting drunk, dancing, getting dirty and maybe waking up in an unusual situation. Records show that B&S balls were being organised as far back as 1861. The original B&S balls were organised for men and women who worked and lived on remote properties. The idea was that they would come to town in their Sunday best, have a dance in the local shire hall, and hopefully meet a potential partner. These days B&S balls are more about alcohol, loud music and perhaps a sly pash. But with the increasing demands of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) laws, B&S balls have been struggling to remain operational and relevant. Andrew Greenwood is co-owner of the BNS Balls Australia website and Facebook group, which promotes B&S balls and offered consultancy to charity groups looking to put one on. He said the balls were becoming a rarity. ""Back in the 1990’s there was about 400 balls a year,"" Mr Greenwood said. ""There used to be at least a couple of B&S balls in Australia every weekend. ""Now there's only about 18 balls still going."" From the end of the 2000s, Mr Greenwood said there was an increase in pricing and ""governance of liquor licensing and insurance"". ""This meant a lot of the smaller balls and charity groups couldn't afford to run the events,"" he said. Mr Greenwood said liquor licensing had become even tougher in recent years. After more than 100 years of history, there are fears B&S balls might become a casualty of tightening liquor licensing laws. ""The way liquor licensing is today, it means that there's no money to be made by the charities and groups who used to run them,"" he said. ""They struggle to meet all the requirements. ""It's the same with insurance; there's so many restrictions that organisers can't run the balls anymore."" Another nail in the coffin for B&S balls has been COVID-19. ""Balls had capped numbers, which meant a lot of people couldn't attend,"" Mr Greenwood said. ""There's been a lot more restrictions as to what people can do at balls due to COVID. ""A lot of balls were community-funded and for some rural charities, the B&S ball was their main money raiser for the year and now they are now longer profitable."" Richmond Spouse Hunters Ball treasurer Lorrae Johnston said they had not held an event since 2019 due to several factors. ""We have had dwindling numbers for the past two to three years,"" she said. ""We have tried numerous things to encourage more patrons to attend and we have also had to cancel for the past few years due to COVID. ""We are hoping that 2023 will be our year."" The last post on The Toowoomba Hay Runners B&S ball Facebook page was in January 2019, which read: ""We regret to inform. But due to REDTAPE, Council Restrictions & Denied activity Applications. The Toowoomba Hay Runners B&S will be postponed at this stage. All ticket holders will be contacted in the next few days and a FULL REFUND issued."" In 2016, Swedish photographer Ingvar Kenne was working on a book about drunk Australia and, after photographing his first B&S ball, decided the book would be solely dedicated to the events. ""When I visited my first B&S ball at Goondiwindi, it was real eye opener, as the B&S ball is a uniquely Australian event,"" he said. ""I also learnt that there's a lot of friendly young people who work hard in the bush and, like all of us, they need an outlet to kick up some dust. ""They work long hard days in remote places far from people and when they do get a chance to meet up, they party quite hard."" Mr Kenne photographed 10 B&S balls between 2016 and 2018 and said that police and security had started to clamp down on B&S balls back then. ""There was talk that in the past B&S balls were even wilder, and that they were less regulated,"" he said. ""I've also heard of a few accidents where people were asleep in their swags and were driven over or there were accidents with utes doing burnouts. ""These days security and insurance have increased to point where the balls are no longer viable.""

73,Once bitten: Amy Shark calls for more protections for musicians and artists as she prepares for huge tour,arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog ARIA award-winning singer Amy Shark is about to embark on a 60-date national tour, after COVID forced many artists to take a two-year hiatus. The tour, which starts in Western Australia this week, will take her to every state and territory, including to rural towns she has never been to and ""can't pronounce"". The Gold Coast artist said it was a welcome relief to be touring again after musicians were forced to quit gigging altogether during the pandemic, with forced closures and cancellations across the entire music and arts scene. She has called on the government ""to learn from what's happened"" and put safeguards in place to protect artists and prevent similar happenings again. ""I feel like it's coming to an end, but it's so uncertain,"" she said. ""We don't know, but I would hope that the powers that be would have learnt from what we've been through and try and get somewhat prepared. ""In case this does happen again, what are the procedures? ""How can we keep Australian music alive?"" While Shark was fortunate enough to play at a handful of COVID-safe events last year, she said many artists were forced to give up on their music careers entirely because of the financial stress of not performing throughout the pandemic. ""So, so many artists I know have just quit, they just can't financially do it anymore. ""And it's so sad, touring is the main source of income for many bands and artists and it was just taken away."" Shark said playing live music and being able to travel interstate and internationally for events is the entire premise of her line of work, and she was thrilled to see borders open again. She said after being forced into a live music and arts drought, she hoped the community might take the industry more seriously and understand it's ""real work"". ""Music just gets treated like its a pastime, even my family don't see it as work,"" she said. ""I'll get back from tour and they'll be like, 'how was your holiday?' ""I just feel like music it should be taken seriously a little more."" Shark has lived in Sydney for the past two years but said she had plans to move back home to the Gold Coast in Queensland, in between her busy schedule and upcoming mega-tour. ""I've obviously had to spend a lot of time abroad and in Sydney for the next wave of music and over COVID I just really missed home,"" she said. ""This is always going to be home to me. ""But yeah I'm really excited because I love going and finding these little gems here and there and I'm going to find some wacky, wonderful places, I'm not going to look at [my schedule] too intently because I just want to get on the bus and go, just arrive in a town. ""There are a few places here and there that we want to find some cool stuff to do, but I'm just going to get in the zone and make sure I'm putting on a good show each night, a balance of staying healthy and enjoying it as well.""

74,Meet the children's author better known as a Super Netball star,arts-culture," Sport Super Netball and NSW Swifts star Maddy Proud releases second children's book in Grace on the Court series Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog NSW Swifts co-captain Maddy Proud plays netball the same way she talks. Fast and frenetic, jumping from left to right, before making sense of her zig-zag route to the point. After the first eight rounds of Super Netball this year, Proud leads the competition for feeds (353) and goal assists (207). To some, it may look like a headless chook running around in a red and blue Swifts dress, but seasoned fans will know there is method behind the madness. It probably comes as no surprise that Proud writes in the same manner, thrashing the keyboard on her computer and throwing herself headfirst into the process. See, the reigning premiership winner is also an author and has just released her second book in the Grace on the Court series, targeting young girls and adolescents. ""I've found that my writing style is very much like the way I talk, and so I'll sit down and write thousands of words non-stop when I'm feeling inspired,"" Proud told The Netty Life podcast. ""Don't get me wrong, there are some days where I can't get anything out, so it is very much all or nothing with me in a lot of ways."" The narratives in Proud's books centre around the life of 13-year-old Grace Parker as she navigates her first years at high school and trialling in the junior netball pathways. The first edition was an instant hit with fans when it was published in 2018 and has become an ongoing source of inspiration for book week school outfits. Although Proud has taken four years to write the next, she's had a lot on her plate – rupturing her ACL, completing the gruelling rehab and helping the Swifts lift two Super Netball trophies. During the most recent grand final in 2021, she played with a broken rib. She has also completed a masters course in creative writing at Macquarie University, hoping to see her beloved pastime evolve into a legitimate career path. ""When I wrote the first book off the back of a World Youth Cup over 10 years ago, I did it with absolutely no expectations to publish and as something I just loved doing to escape,"" Proud said. ""It was a time in my life where I didn't have a lot going on other than netball, so it was almost therapeutic, and it wasn't until much further down the road that I realised it was something I wanted to get out into the world. ""So with this second book, I was a bit worried thinking, 'was it all a fluke?' ""If I'm going to call myself an author, then I should probably make sure I learn the craft. ""The course was a real eye-opener and an unreal experience: my lecturer became my mentor and it helped so much."" As a respected leader in the sport and with form that has seen her on the fringe of the Australian Diamonds squad, Proud is a popular figure within the netball community. Her down-to-earth personality means she doesn't take life too seriously, often poking fun at herself for regularly falling over on the netball court, and openly talking about her love of pop culture — especially singer Harry Styles. These characteristics, as well as the fact that Proud is unashamedly herself, make her especially relatable for young girls. It's something Proud cites as an important theme in her writing, too. ""The protagonist in my stories is quite relatable, she goes through experiences that most teenagers do during that transition from primary to high school, which is a really critical time. ""I tried to keep the story true with the problems and challenges that arise around balancing sport, friends and maybe love interests. ""I hope it helps readers deal with these things, whether they learn from her doing the right thing or sometimes making a mistake."" We're reached the halfway point of the 2022 Super Netball competition. Here are our picks for Team of the Season so far. In her main career as an elite netballer, Proud is often spoken about as being a role model. Now it seems her second job involves the same purpose: to set a good example. ""I love hearing parents say, 'my daughter loves reading and she never liked sport, but after reading your book she's trialling for the school team.' ""Or, 'my daughter loves netball and she wanted to read the book because you'd written it and although she'd never finished one before, she read yours cover to cover.' ""For me, sport was the saving grace that kept me focused and helped me enjoy school. ""I wouldn't be the person I am today without it, so if I can encourage one girl or boy to pick up a book or try sport, then that's my job done.""

76,"How subscription streaming killed this Victorian video store, one of the last ones left",arts-culture,"  It's closing credits for Colac Video, south-west Victoria's last video hire shop Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog South-west Victoria's last video rental shop will close at the end of the month after Colac Video owner Joe Argento decided it was time to hit the ""stop"" button. The store survived as part of the Colac streetscape into the 2020s as other video hire stores disappeared in surrounding Ballarat, Geelong and Warrnambool. However, as the trickle of customers to streaming services became a flood during the height of the pandemic, Mr Argento said he was forced to admit the day of the video store was over. ""It's finally caught up with us,"" he said. ""It's because of all the streaming services, and COVID just added to it. ""The way the technology is, though, I think it was inevitable. Year on year, it was a trend that was downhill and then there was COVID and people weren't able to come in. According to a 2021 Media Content Consumption Survey by the Social Research Centre, 79 per cent of Australian households have at least one subscription video-on-demand service. Mr Argento said that being in a small town has meant that his customers have been loyal. ""It is sad. We had really loyal, regular customers. They are all disappointed,"" he said. ""We have a lot from the Otways, too. Maybe the reception [for streaming] is still not very good there. ""We're only a small town and I was wondering how to keep it going, but Ballarat and Warrnambool – with much larger populations – their video shops closed a long time ago."" Colac Video was comparatively late to the video craze, opening about 22 years ago. Mr Argento said he took over the shop about 2011, then three years ago moved the store to a smaller location in an effort to reduce costs. In that time, south-west Victoria's final video shop became something of a curiosity. ""We had quite a few people from Melbourne wander past. They'd go into the shop with their kids to say this is what we used to do when we were your age,"" he said. ""I'd imagine there would be some kids who will never experience [going into a video shop]. ""We were still mainly hiring out the videos. We only started a little retail to see what we could do. For Mr Argento, the decision to close was a weighty one, but one he has not regretted. ""It was stressful and sad making the decision [to close] but, now it's been made, I do feel some relief,"" he said. ""I'm 72 so I've quite a lot of work to do at home that I haven't done because of the shop, and I need to catch up with the grandkids. Mr Argento said that in his experience, the Marvel superhero films continued to be the most popular films even as overall video hire declined. The store will remain open until the end of May. ""We're just hiring out the new releases,"" Mr Argento said. ""The weekly ones are actually cheaper to buy than to hire.""

77,Teenager stuns fashion legends with wool design,arts-culture,"  Runway success as designers weave merino wool into diverse range of garments for Fleece to Fashion Awards Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Wool has been taken off the sheep's back and woven into everything from sportswear to wedding gowns for the annual Fleece to Fashion Awards in the New England region of New South Wales on the weekend. It was a chance for the industry to promote its product through fashion, and after a two-year hiatus due to COVID, the event was bigger than ever, with guests filling Uralla's historic Deargee Woolshed on Saturday night. With eight categories to enter, a stand-out category this year was a new addition called Diversity in Wool, where entrants could celebrate their culture through their designs. Prominent Australian designer Johnathan Ward was one of the judges and said he was impressed by the broad range of fashions on display in that section of the awards. ""Incredible ... it was probably one of our biggest entries and there was a lot of diversity and interest,"" he said. ""What can be done with [wool] ... that category I was particularly interested in."" Mr Ward found the calibre of designs across all categories outstanding and the future of the design industry promising. ""All the judges had to really sit and look at each other and go back and go, 'OK, how do we stop fighting and decide who gets first and second in this category?'"" A 15-year-old Uralla Central School student won the MJ Bale Supreme Award, with Dechen Kandroher taking out the top prize for her design. The pantsuit, cape and clouche hat ensemble was made entirely from merino wool. Fleece to Fashion board director and wool grower Liz Foster said the design was outstanding. ""The judges were blown away by Dechen's entry – not only was it a stunning outfit, [but by] the fact it was made by a young student who started sewing at the age of nine to improve her skills and has been taking sewing classes with a professional dressmaker locally,"" Mrs Foster said. Dechen was also awarded the Winterbourne Pastoral Company Secondary School Award. She said merino wool was a special fibre to work with. ""I took my inspiration for the pantsuit from Chanel but I wanted to make something than could be dressed up for a special occasion or be worn on an everyday basis,"" she said. ""I also included a felt hat, which is something I had never designed or made before, which was a lot of fun."" Local wool grower Lachlan Fulloon is the chairman of Fleece to Fashion. He said the event was an important way to showcase the diversity of the fibre. ""Wool is a fibre that is very unique in its qualities,"" he said. ""For the local wool growers and growers throughout Australia and the world it's a good opportunity to see the fruits of our labour. ""It's quite amazing to see the designs that can come from that.""

78,'No limits': How poet Ellen van Neerven is queering sports writing,arts-culture," Sport 'No limits': How non-binary First Nations poet Ellen van Neerven is queering sports writing Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It's difficult to know exactly how to categorise Ellen van Neerven's story No Limits. Part creative memoir, part reportage, part theoretical essay and part history lesson, the story weaves anecdotes of the poet's own childhood playing football with conversations between three friends – Maddee, Zaky and Louis – as they meditate on their own experiences as trans and gender-diverse people who participate in community sport. The genre of the piece is hard to pin down. It's broken up into uneven, non-chronological segments with sub-headings like ""SOVEREIGN GENDERS"", ""DIFFICULT JOY"" and ""POWER"". It easily slides between lyrical, descriptive first-person and objective, academic third-person. It dedicates entire sections to the interviewees' transcribed voices. It plucks phrases from writers and athletes like Siufung Law, Jaiyah Saelua and Essa May Ranapiri and it draws upon First Nations cultural knowledge, history and language while critiquing Western patriarchal conceptions of gender and sexuality. Of course, the difficulty — not knowing exactly where this piece fits within the broader web of Australian writing — is the point. Just as its title suggests, No Limits defies and complicates (or ""queers"") literary genres and forms in order to emphasise the radical nature of its subject matter: how trans and gender-diverse people challenge the traditional stereotypes and assumptions around gender and bodies that structure our everyday lives. For van Neerven, there are few better prisms through which to triangulate this conversation than through the complex, yet rigid, space of sport. ""I remember wanting to write something that was experimental and blurred the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction, and was something that didn't shy away from discussing sexuality or gender identity,"" van Neerven told the ABC. ""When I was growing up, sexuality was really repressed. The environment that I was in was a really suppressed kind of environment, so me writing about sexuality, sex and gender identity is pushing back against all of the suppression that I had when I was growing up. ""There were really strong stereotypes of what a queer person was or would look like or how they'd act. Lots of homophobic and transphobic slurs, racist slurs, coming left, right and centre. ""One of them was that if you play soccer, you're a lesbian. A lot of the girls I played with, they really pushed hard against that. If they were gay, they hid it. If they weren't, they were still affected by it because they created a hyper-hetero-feminine presentation in how they acted and dressed to fit in. ""People would ask me when I was 13 or 14: 'are you gay? Are you this? Are you that?' People would ask me, 'are you a boy or a girl?' All this stuff. I didn't really have any answers. ""Space politics is something I'm really interested in and that I try to represent in my work about sport. You're growing up and you're just trying to fit in and find your belonging: it's a really ripe subject matter to write about."" No Limits forms part of a larger collection of work that van Neerven is compiling into a book titled Personal Score, recently acquired by University of Queensland Press. When released, it will be one of the only collections of non-academic Australian sports writing told from the perspective of a queer, non-binary, First Nations writer, which also gives voice to some of the most marginalised communities within sport. It follows a small, if growing, trend of life writing in women's sport that examines the tensions of culture, gender and sexuality, including USA footballer Megan Rapinoe's One Life and Australian cricketer Alex Blackwell's Fair Game. ""With the incredible upsurge in the popularity of women's sport comes the potential to reshape the narratives around sport and culture,"" the press release reads. ""As Personal Score examines, many athletes challenge mainstream views of gender and sexuality and use sport and their role within it to effect change not only in their own sporting realm but more broadly in the wider culture and society. ABCQueer has compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQI+ people, their families and friends. ""Moreover, van Neerven interrogates the implications of playing sport on stolen land and how this complicates questions of identity around sport, who plays it, and where. ""Thus, Personal Score is also a meditation on Indigenous connections to place and land, examining the earliest sports played here and paying tribute to influential First Nations sportspeople."" It's a particularly timely work in light of recent discourses around the inclusion of trans women in Australian sport. In No Limits, van Neerven hands the microphone to the LGBTQIA+ people that recent debate has talked largely around, but rarely to, about their experiences — a majority of whom participate and will be affected at the community level. Like the author, each of the interviewees reflects on their childhoods and the role of sport in their social, physical and psychological lives. Maddee played basketball and netball. Zaky was a state representative in badminton. Louis played Aussie rules and became a national champion futsal goalkeeper. But as each of them — including van Neerven — grew older and came to consciousness of their gender identities, some of them undertaking the extensive process of hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery, their relationship with sport and its communities changed. As strict gender binaries were more heavily enforced, and as cultures of homophobia and transphobia began to manifest in more blatant (and dangerous) ways, they all had times where they quit sport altogether. ""Fewer than 20 per cent of trans people play sport in Australia and even fewer participate in team sport,"" van Neerven writes. ""Often, LGBTIQSB+ children grow up feeling like they don't have a place in sport where they can authentically be themselves without fear of judgement, harassment, abuse, or violence. ""When TGD [trans and gender-diverse] people are denied sport, they miss out on enduring friendships that often transcend many divides. They don't pose a threat to sport, but they are the survivors of vicious transphobic campaigns to exclude them from what is a fundamental human right. ""Colonial gender binaries hold up the Western patriarchy. TGD identities – including sistergirls and brotherboys, pan-First Nations terms that describe some TGD people in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander communities — don't fit into the rigid colonial understandings of gender. Sistergirls, brotherboys and gender-diverse Aboriginal Australians from around the country have come together in Melbourne to share stories of culture, identity and struggle. ""I have never felt like a girl or a woman. I feel masculine in some ways and feminine in others, as if there are two spirits living within me, harmoniously. ""If sport is 'sex-segregated', heteronormative and explicitly trans-exclusionary, what kind of world is created, violently policed, and upheld? ""These spaces are forceful dystopias, complete departures from the liberated lives our ancestors had."" One of the effects of No Limits, and by extension Personal Score, is that it helps rewrite wider narratives around the realities of trans and gender-diverse people participating in sport. By engaging wholeheartedly with the tangle of the personal and the political, and by giving voice and agency to the most marginalised in the community, van Neerven's writing combats the arguments and assumptions put forward by louder voices elsewhere that contribute to discrimination towards people who sit outside essentialist framings of gender. ""There's so many transphobic pieces in The Australian every month, and they're just about the most marginalised group wanting to participate in sport, but instead they get all this propaganda and there's not much reporting at all on the people who are actually playing the sport,"" van Neerven said. ""The reporting is about whether they should play sport. That's a huge problem. ""We need to reframe this stuff and actually ask athletes themselves what they want to talk about. We never ask sportspeople what narratives they want to tell about themselves; what narratives they want to tell about their broader worlds, you know? ""So when you have journalists and politicians acting in a certain way — that don't bother exploring the nuances or different experiences of something — it's so defeating. ""That's the interesting stuff we've missed out on: people talking about their lives in interesting ways and not further perpetuating stereotypes. ""Australia really uses sport as a propaganda machine to say, 'we're a white nation, we're a patriarchal nation, we're the land of the underdog, the battlers, this and that.' It's really hard to push up against it, but we have to try."" As van Neerven's interviewees explain, gender-non-conforming people and sport do not have to be mutually exclusive. Louis dreams of returning to play futsal in a mixed team after top surgery. Maddee has become a competitive powerlifter. Zaky, for now, simply walks while reflecting on his position on and relationship with Wurundjeri land. It is sport itself, then, that must acknowledge and adapt to the changing face of Australia's communities: to open up, to adjust or to collapse entirely its rigid binary categories in order to become a genuinely diverse, inclusive place. Importantly, No Limits closes with all four voices reflecting on their versions of sport utopias, where ""utopia"" functions as a way of critiquing the current state of things. Despite what feels like insurmountable challenges, there remains a kindling of hope that sport is not so set in its ways that it is incapable of imagining alternatives to the way things have always been. ""[Utopia] would just be where trans people are free to play as the gender that they want to,"" Louis says. ""I don't know whether that means we abolish the gender segregation of sports […] It would just be that women are encouraged to play sport at an early age in the same way men are."" ""Every time you create a gendered structure around the sport, it's going to affect the way that people see themselves and engage in the sport,"" Maddee says. ""They are trying to design a perfect system that works for everyone … that doesn't work because the whole idea of sports being fair in the first place isn't real. ""Most of the time, trans people just want to get out there and exist in a sport and enjoy training. If you can't pause and exist in a moment, there's no point."" Perhaps the most radical and profound sports utopia is the one imagined by Zaky — one in which gender no longer exists. A place of no limits. ""My utopia isn't a trans utopia,"" he says. ""My utopia is a utopia where everyone gets to find pleasure and joy in moving their body, be aggressive and be strong and be together in that space, despite their gender. Which in itself is a trans utopia. It's my utopia and I happen to be trans. This is what I hope for the future."" As van Neerven concludes: ""My utopia looks for a day when TGD people's inclusion in sport is not news and not up for debate, when no one has to fight to have a space and when we move on from reports of inclusion to reports of playing. ""Playing — and living: I insist on doing both.""

""With much sadness, I can confirm that my son, Jethro, has passed away,"" Cave said in a statement. ""We would be grateful for family privacy at this time."" Jethro Lazenby, aged in his 30s, was a model and photographer and had acted in two films in 2007 and 2011. He was Cave's son with model Beau Lazenby. Another of the singer's sons, Arthur Cave, died in 2015 after falling from a cliff in Brighton, England. Arthur Cave was the musician's son with his current wife Susie. Susie Cave posted a tribute to Jethro on her Instagram account shortly after the news of his death was made public, simply writing ""Darling Jethro"". In a 2018 letter to a fan, Cave wrote about the grief he felt after Arthur's death. ""I feel the presence of my son, all around, but he may not be there. I hear him talk to me, parent me, guide me, though he may not be there,"" he wrote. ""He visits Susie in her sleep regularly, speaks to her, comforts her, but he may not be there.

80,HOTA's 'surreal' first year in challenging times,arts-culture,"  Gold Coast's HOTA gallery's first year was 'tough' but arts precinct attracts patrons amid council review Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It has been a ""tough"" and ""surreal"" 12 months for the Gold Coast's Home of the Arts, but the $60.5 million art gallery has experienced a record number of monthly visitors, according to its chief executive. The art gallery, funded by the Gold Coast City Council, is the largest outside of a capital city in Australia. The chief executive of Home of the Arts (HOTA), Criena Gehrke, said opening the gallery in the middle of a pandemic ""was surreal"". ""Behind the scenes it was pretty tough going,"" she said. ""During that period of time there was a great stand-down of our staff because of COVID. ""We were operating on about 10 per cent of the workforce; we had to keep the planning going, there were issues with supply chain, with freight, with getting things into the gallery."" While HOTA's financial performance will break even or see ""a little bit of an operating deficit"" this year, Ms Gehrke says April's visitation numbers reflect the precinct's potential. More than 180,000 people visited the HOTA gallery in the past 12 months, about 31,000 of which attended in April. Last month 8,450 patrons attended HOTA's cinema and almost 15,000 attended live events, including 11,418 at three sold-out concerts at the outdoor stage. While about 14,000 patrons dined at the precinct's hospitality venues, 5,476 people attended HOTA's shop and more than 10,000 visited the markets. ""It was like that moment of, 'Oh, there it is',"" Ms Gehrke said. ""It's been such a tough two-and-a-half years, and this is what this precinct is and can be. ""I think it was pretty well unprecedented anywhere else in Australia that an institution was opening a major cultural asset at that time."" Ms Gehrke said April's visitation numbers aligned with projections made when planning for the gallery began four years ago but that ""it's still been up and down with our visitation over the past 12 months"". ""Over summer with Omicron, we couldn't get artists here; there was a whole range of impacts with our staff getting sick,"" she said. ""We opened Lyrical Landscapes which was the beautiful William Robinson collection of works in August and we were open for a day and then closed down again for two weeks [due to lockdown]."" HOTA has forecast it will end this financial year with a total revenue of $26 million. ""There's a high degree of investment by the City of Gold Coast and the fine ratepayers of the Gold Coast in that,"" Ms Gehrke said. The Gold Coast City Council provided $15.9 million towards operating costs this financial year, according to a HOTA spokesperson. About $10 million in revenue has been raised through ticket sales, fundraising and food and beverage sales. The City of Gold Coast has spent $135 million in capital expenditure for the entire precinct, including the $19.5 million Green Bridge connecting HOTA to Chevon Island. In November, the council resolved to review HOTA after Mayor Tom Tate suggested the management of its $37 million outdoor stage could be outsourced to an external operator, amid concerns it had been under-utilised. ""There's some complexity around an external operator coming in,"" Ms Gehrke said. ""If that was the approach that was decided on, in terms of how you operate a precinct with the gallery going full ball, with the theatres full, with the car parking, with the operational overlay"". ""When you think about the last two years ... it just hasn't been possible to have that level of gigs,"" she said. ""But when you think back to April, we've had three sold-out gigs; we've got pencil bookings for gigs coming up right through the year. ""I do think that space is well utilised but, as I say, we welcome any alternate options because all we're interested in is the success of HOTA."" Council considered phase one of the confidential review during a closed meeting last week. It resolved that ""the City chief executive officer be approved to engage a consultant (if required) to provide further advice"" on the future operating model of HOTA, ""with the outcomes of any consultancy to be considered at a future council meeting"". Councillors also resolved that HOTA funding requests for capital works or exhibitions be submitted via a new licence agreement ""which includes the submission of a full business case"". Mr Tate says while ""they've [HOTA] gone from nothing in the same time of having COVID inhibit all gatherings"", his main concern ""is where do we go from here?"". ""How do we encourage HOTA to be a bit more evolved as far as exhibitions [are] concerned?"" he said. ""The numbers show that people are coming, especially locals. ""It's been difficult but we're heading in the right direction.""

81,Indigenous sisters' fashion dreams come true with Vogue feature and runway plans,arts-culture,"  Indigenous sisters' dreams come true with Myrrdah label launch, Vogue feature, and Fashion Week plans Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Being on the cover of Vogue magazine has always been the dream for Kalkadoon sisters Dale Bruce, Cheryl Perez, Glenda McCulloch and Jaunita Doyle. ""There was an Instagram filter where you could put yourself on the cover of Vogue and we would always play around with it and joke,"" Glenda said. ""Since forever — that's how long it's been our dream. We've always wanted to do something with clothes."" Just months after launching their fashion label Myrrdah, the sisters pried open the glossy pages of Vogue's 2022 May issue to see their designs featured in the main spread. ""I just think it's ridiculous,"" Glenda said. ""We can't believe how quickly this has all happened. This is our first crack at anything fashion and to start off our label by featuring in one of the biggest fashion magazines in the country … it's mind blowing."" The sisters' success didn't stop there. This week, they will watch their designs walk down the runway at Australian Fashion Week in Sydney. ""I mean, we must be doing something right,"" Glenda said. ""I just can't believe how far we've come."" As descendants of the Kalkatunga tribe, the red-dirt land of Mount Isa, Queensland, has always been an important part of the sisters' lives and something that feeds their creativity. Their journey to fashion design began with their love of art. In 2019, Glenda founded Cungelella Art to share her culture with the rest of the world. ""We've always painted. Our parents, our uncles and aunties always went bush and painted artefacts,"" she said. ""When the Black Lives Matter movement reached Australia, the interest in our art just skyrocketed."" It was their mum who inspired them to make the leap into fashion. ""Our mum is our biggest advocate. She was always telling us we could do the fashion thing if we tried and she was a really good seamstress, so she was always helping us,"" Glenda said. ""She showed us how to pick which artworks would do well on fabric."" So in 2020, the sisters launched Myrrdah, named in honour of their great great grandmother of the same name. Starting a fashion label during a lockdown wasn't easy, the sisters said. ""We couldn't actually visit Melbourne where our designs were being processed onto fabric, so we had to collaborate through Pinterest boards and text messages to actually produce the pieces for Vogue and [fashion week],"" Jaunita said. Some preconceived assumptions about the glamour of the fashion world were certainly quashed. ""If anyone's seen our set-ups, they wouldn't believe we're fashion designers,"" Jaunita laughed. ""We're usually working at 11 o'clock at night. The kids are still awake running around, fighting around us as we're drinking tea."" When they watch their custom pieces float down the runway this week, it will be the first time they will see their work up close. ""We haven't actually touched the fabric yet,"" Jaunita said. Regardless, the sisters aren't letting anything stop them from launching their debut collection this month. But they say customers will have to beat their mum to some of the prized pieces. ""We've told her the collection is quite limited but she's already claimed she's getting her hands on some of the pieces, so good luck to anyone going up against her,"" Jaunita laughed. Glenda said it would be an emotional experience. ""All our pieces are a representation of Mount Isa and our homeland. It's the story of the country out here,"" she said. ""We're lost for words at the chance to share our culture with the rest of the country."" ABC North West Qld will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

83,Tasmania's modernist architecture captured by photographer,arts-culture,"  Tasmania's Art Deco, modernist architecture captured by photographer Thomas Ryan Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Tasmania's modern architecture is often overlooked, but one man has spent the past 20 years taking a step back and appreciating it. From the brutalism of buildings like Launceston's Henty House and Hobart's former Murray Street offices to quirky suburban Art Deco, Thomas Ryan has been capturing the art movement of modernism through his lens. The visual artist and architectural photographer documents everyday modernism and tells the stories behind the buildings. ""I'm trying to create a human angle that people can connect to,"" Mr Ryan said. ""I often think a photo can't save a building but it's a driving obsession and it becomes a visual memory of place."" He interviews people who have connections with buildings and has befriended some of the architects behind them, like the late Dirk Bolt who designed Hobart's 10 Murray Street government offices He also befriended the foreman of the demolition project. ""I got inside when they were literally ripping it to shreds,"" Mr Ryan said. Mr Ryan aims to tell all angles of a building's story and wants to celebrate and protect the era of design through his project Tasmanian Modernism. ""Tasmania is associated with its rich trove of heritage buildings and history but there is a long way to go in terms of protecting these buildings for future generations,"" he said. ""There is a larger appreciation and protection of Art Deco buildings now, but modernist designs throughout Tasmania are lacking in listing and are at risk of being lost."" Mr Ryan said it wasn't long ago that Art Deco buildings weren't in vogue and were threatened with demolition. ""Modernism now faces many of these same historical issues that buildings of the past faced,"" he said. ""What we see today as history and heritage will change over time so it’s important to see heritage as more than just sandstone."" Mr Ryan's project includes the Art Deco movement, which in Tasmania represents the period of design between 1930 and 1945, which was later than the European movement. Modernism is the period after World War II and continued well into the 1980s. ""Within modernism, there are all kinds of different styles like mid-century modern, brutalism; they all sit within that context,"" Mr Ryan said. ""The Art Deco movement focused on decoration and ornamental qualities such as the former Hydro Electric Commission headquarters and the modernist movement stripped decoration from buildings."" The modernism design principle was ""form follows function"", Mr Ryan said. He said there were many excellent examples of Art Deco in Tasmania, pointing to Holyman House in Launceston and the Colonial Mutual Life building with its gargoyles and terracotta detailing in Hobart's CBD. ""Modernist examples include the State Library in Hobart from the 1960s with its glass curtain wall panels,"" he said. ""The latter part of the 20th century witnessed design influences shift to experimenting with concrete."" Examples include buildings such as the Lands Building in Hobart, Don College in Devonport and Henty House in Launceston. ""Henty House is still one of my favourite buildings; it's so sculptural, it's like abstract art,"" Mr Ryan said. The Supreme Court in Hobart was designed by the same Tasmanian architect, Peter Partridge. Mr Ryan has been working on the modernism project for 20 years and aims to have his work made into a book. He thinks his passion for the era stems from growing up in Far North Queensland before moving to Tasmania. ""Looking back, I was probably homesick, and you familiarise yourself with what you remember and know, and a lot of those kind of buildings were in north Queensland,"" he said. It wasn't Tasmania's historic sandstone buildings that caught his eye. ""A lot was done of that earlier architecture period, but I grew up with this other period of architecture and it's part of my story,"" Mr Ryan said. ""The more you looked into it historically, it was such a boom period. ""It all really took off post war and with immigration and it's a unique story to be told and it hasn't been looked at much before."" Mr Ryan said the 1936 Star Theatre in Launceston was a great example of streamline Art Deco. ""It had a relatively short life as a cinema, closing its doors in 1969 just 33 years after it started showing its first movies,"" he said. ""Many cinemas struggled to stay open due to the advent of television."" He said Launceston lost a grand Art Deco theatre to the wrecking ball in the 1960s, and many others around Australia met with the same fate. ""The Star operated as a charity shop for decades afterwards until in 2018 it was reopened as a cinema again,"" Mr Ryan said. ""With its recent reopening as a cinema, it's a case of back to the future for the Star.""

84,"Richard Connolly, who composed the Play School theme song, dies aged 94",arts-culture,"  Richard Connolly, who composed the Play School theme song, dies aged 94 Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Richard Connolly, one of Australia's most prolific composers, has died aged 94. Connolly is best known for writing the theme song for the children's show Play School, as well as an internationally renowned collection of hymns. His iconic tune to the long-running series was written overnight while Connolly was working for ABC Education. Connolly's version, in which he also sang the lyrics by early childhood educator Dr Rosemary Milne, debuted on July 18, 1966. There's a Bear in There has been re-recorded several times, most recently in 2016 as part of a triple j competition to mark the TV show's 50th anniversary. But Connolly's original tune remains at the heart of the song, making it one of Australia's best known anthems. Born on November 10, 1927 in the Western Sydney suburb of Granville, Connolly was the eldest of eight children. A talented young boy who spoke Latin, he was earmarked early on to become a Catholic priest. In 1946, he left the shores of New South Wales to study at the prestigious seminary Propaganda Fide in Rome. He returned four years later unordained, instead choosing to study arts at the University of Sydney. Connolly's passion for theology led him to his career at the ABC, where he started work in religious broadcasts in 1956. There he became a go-to man for music, composing extensively for radio and TV programs, as well as Australian documentaries and film. His daughter, Polly Connolly, said one afternoon he was asked to write the theme song for a new kids TV show, Play School. ""He basically came home and banged it out and had to record it the next day,"" she told the ABC. ""When I was a little girl, my mum would call me and my little sister inside and say 'come and listen to daddy sing'."" Play School debuted on ABC TV on the morning of Monday, July 18, 1966 with presenters Alister Smart and Diane Dorgan. The show has outlived the BBC version it was based on, and is now the second-longest-running English-language children's show worldwide. Dr Milne, the lyricist for There's a Bear in There, also wrote the show's first scripts. She died of cancer in 2010 aged 83. Her and Connolly's song was inducted into the National Film and Sound Archive Sounds of Australia collection in 2017. The collection represents audio that has ""cultural, historical and aesthetic significance and relevance, which inform or reflect life in Australia"". Connolly last performed the song for ABC TV show Gruen in 2020. Libbie Doherty, ABC Head of Children's Production, said Connolly left behind a legacy ""like no other"". ""Over the past 57 years, countless generations of Australian children have heard and sung Connolly's Play School theme song There's a Bear in There that continues to inspire preschoolers for years to come,"" Doherty said. Despite its notoriety, the Play School theme was not the music Connolly was most proud of creating. In the late 1950s, Connolly partnered with Tasmanian poet James McAuley to create a collection of hymns in English. At the time, the Catholic church was struggling to transition away from singing exclusively in Latin as the new music did not sit well with parishioners. ""There was literally, for about 20 years, a worldwide shortage of suitable music for the Catholic mass,"" said Noel Debien, family friend and ABC Religion and Ethics senior specialist producer. ""It was pop music basically, and there were a lot of people who didn't want pop music in church, they thought that belonged in concerts. ""And Richard and James gave them a way to have something that was in English — they could go to the new music, but the new music was quality."" The songs, which went on to be sold as the Living Parish Hymn Book, took off across the country and overseas. ""Anywhere English is spoken, you'll find Richard's hymns,"" Mr Debien said. Daughter Polly said other than his nine children, her father felt the hymns were his greatest work. ""Anybody who went to Catholic school in the 70s, 80s, 90s, has sung dad's hymns,"" she said. ""There are many of dad's kids that aren't practising Catholics anymore, but we're so proud of his music; some of them are really beautiful."" Connolly also composed the music for the 1970 visit of Pope Paul VI, the first Pope to visit Australia, and again for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI in 2008. The Catholic church was not the only institution Connolly helped navigate through difficult times. In 1967, he joined Radio Drama and Features at the ABC at a time when audiences were switching off. Having studied broadcasters in France, Italy and Germany as part of the Churchill Fellowship in 1971, Connolly returned to transform the department into a ""creative powerhouse"", friend and former colleague Roz Cheney said. ""One of Dick's great legacies is that he turned ABC Radio, at that time, towards Europe and away from the Anglo-domination of the BBC,"" she said. ""New ways were found to broadcast wonderful programs that acknowledged other languages and other cultures. ""We were hired by Dick to go into the future."" As head of the department, Connolly oversaw the broadcast of radio plays and book reviews, as well as the reading of epic poems including Aeneid and Beowulf. ""There was not the dead hand of serious dullness on them — they were very lively and energetic,"" Ms Cheney said. ""He was an inspiring producer."" Polly said her father ""lived and breathed the ABC"" — and rugby league team the Western Suburbs Magpies. ""It really was an amazing thing to be at Lidcombe Oval with my dad in the '70s, all us kids, while he'd be roaring for the Magpies,"" she said. ""Literally the next week he'd be in the old radio Forbes Street studios recording the finest international radio programs in Latin."" Connolly retired in 1988 and spent the last few years of his life at Alexander Aged Care in Brookvale, NSW. He died on May 4, and is survived by his wife Cynthia and his nine children. His funeral will be held at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney on May 19.

85,'He's always changing': Nick Cave and Warren Ellis are subjects of joyous new music documentary,arts-culture,"  Nick Cave and Warren Ellis documentary This Much I Know to Be True reunites Bad Seeds collaborators with director Andrew Dominik Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog There is a scene in the new documentary about Nick Cave that neatly sums up the artist's outlook on life. Prevented from touring while in lockdown in Brighton, England, Cave embraced a new-found pastime after the British government obtusely pushed artists to retrain. ""I took the government's advice. I've retrained as a ceramicist, because it's no longer viable to be a touring artist,"" Cave quips to camera. Cut to the musician, author, occasional actor and now-ceramicist's studio, featuring his latest creation: a series of figures suitably dark and foreboding, which he christened The Life of the Devil. Cutting humour aside, the man we see in Andrew Dominik's new film, This Much I Know to Be True, is a radically different beast to the tortured soul of One More Time with Feeling – the director's haunting 2016 document of Cave trying to navigate his way through immense grief in the wake of his son Arthur's sudden, shocking death. Insisting on completing a then-new album with his band of nearly 40 years, the Bad Seeds, Cave seemed like an artist hanging by a thread. Although Dominik's direction in 2022 isn't radically different – both films were shot in the round with a circular dolly track following the musicians as they perform – this new documentary is awash with colour (rather than its predecessor's stark black and white palette). It is often joyous, laced with wit. Only one figure from the Bad Seeds, Warren Ellis, is present, together with an array of supporting figures, the most notable of which is a brief appearance from guest performer Marianne Faithfull. ""For me, it was about the songs,"" Dominik says of his film. This Much I Know to Be True showcases Cave's most recent music (2019 Bad Seeds record Ghosteen and Cave and Ellis's 2021 album Carnage), which is carefully rehearsed, performed and expounded upon in the film. The concert-without-an-audience is presented in a bespoke, cinematic setting – a deserted performance space in Battersea in south London – with 7.1 surround sound. The cumulative effect is breathtaking, with a stripped-down sense of purpose that belies a quietly assured and apt grandiosity. ""I've been there when the songs were created and they meant something to me,"" Dominik says. ""So when they were due to go out on tour, I said, 'Let's shoot a live show. Get the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, lots of screens.' They were going to have 12 backup singers."" That tour was cancelled — no guesses why. ""And then Nick just asked me [to film]. He just needed to do something during the pandemic, basically. That was the sort of impetus – the main motive, really."" The tour that Cave and Ellis conceived last year did eventually appear, albeit in a somewhat scaled-down form, playing to rave notices across Europe and the US – and soon, Australia – making Dominik's film timelier than he may have foreseen. Not that any of the key players have had much time to pause between gigs. Dominik's next dramatic film, the much-anticipated Netflix biopic Blonde, which stars Cuban actor Ana de Armas as screen goddess Marilyn Monroe, is also due to finally appear later in the year, with an original score by Cave and Ellis. What makes the pair's working relationship so unique? Each has a vastly different approach, Dominik says. Cave's precision is matched by Ellis's seemingly random, endless, stream-of-consciousness output. Together, it works remarkably well. ""It's a lot about Nick trying to get Warren's attention. That's what Nick describes it as,"" Dominik says. ""Warren's very good with Nick. I don't know if Warren makes music every day, but he makes so much [of it]. And he just keeps going, you know. It really forces you to be there in a way where you get lost in it."" Dominik's working relationship with the pair dates back to his 2007 revisionist western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (a three-hour director's cut of which is also expected to emerge at some point). By then, Cave and Ellis had expanded their repertoire to become full-blown film composers for hire, and Dominik has evidently grown closer to them both in the years since, particularly in the wake of the tumultuous events of the last seven years. The Cave he now knows is drastically different from the man he met in the late 80s when they were both part of the Melbourne arts scene. ""The first time I met Nick was at a drug dealer's. I was just an innocent private school boy trying to get a heroin habit,"" Dominik says with a wry smile. ""It was around [the Bad Seeds' album] Tender Prey [in 1988]. I walk in and the Prince of Darkness was sitting on the couch, watching a documentary about earthworms. And I ask him, 'What are you watching?' And he just turned around and bared his teeth at me, with his wild hair and crazy eyes, and growled. He's changed incredibly, from the guy on the couch to who he is today."" Cave has also moved on considerably from their last documentary encounter in 2016 – something Dominik wanted to capture on film. Looking remarkably well-preserved, Cave is more holistic about his place in the world. ""He's the only person who's had a career like this, right?"" Dominik muses. ""At 60-whatever-he-is, he's more successful now than he's ever been – like every record sells double the previous record. ""I think he's got a lot of good attitudes about stuff. He's honest and he's always changing. I'm sure he goes through periods when he gets a bit calcified or something, but something will happen to move him out of it. He always seems to be evolving. And everything he says is incredibly sane. Like, really sane."" This Much I Know to Be True is in cinemas from May 11. Tops Arts & Culture headlines.

87,Mystery behind the political names on this 113yo tea cloth,arts-culture,"  Queensland Museum gifted tea cloth signed by prominent federal, state politicians Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A tea cloth embroidered with the signatures of more than 60 politicians from the early 1900s has prompted a nationwide search for the people and history behind the names. Complete with mended holes and small kitchen stains, historians believe the 113-year-old linen tea cloth shows the names of both federal and state members stitched around the signature of former Labor prime minister Andrew Fisher. The years ""1909"" and ""1915"" have been embroidered on either side – the years Mr Fisher was in government. Queensland Museum curator Judith Hickson hopes the public can help them unearth the stories behind the tea cloth puzzle, especially four signatures on the towel yet to be identified. ""Even the ones we've deciphered have been very tricky, it's been luck and searching through lists of parliamentary names,"" she says. ""We have two J Macdonalds, but the only J Macdonald we can currently identify is a JV Macdonald who was a former senator at the time. ""The other we think reads JS Macdonald but we're not sure and we can't find anything on this J Macdonald in the parliamentary records, so we don't know who he is."" The other mystery signature is Mr John Christie, who could have had one of three occupations. ""The only records we can find on him are those of a journalist, detective or a murderer — he could have been all three,"" Ms Hickson says. ""We would really love it if someone could shed some light on that as well."" With the help of some budding investigators from the public, the museum recently resolved the signatures of WJ Henry and NX Henry to be William James and Nora Xavier Henry. ""Apparently William James was a police sergeant and a member of the Queensland Police Union at the time and there are records of him and his wife Nora being buried in the Toowong Cemetery,"" Ms Hickson says. The cloth was embroidered by Beatrice Ferricks in the early 1900s; her husband Myles was a Labor party member at the time. ""It's been well used, mended, slightly stained and worn from use before being folded and put away in the cupboard — it's certainly had a place in the home,"" Ms Hickson says. ""It's the size of a card table and I imagine it would have been a great point of discussion for visitors to the Ferricks home."" The tea cloth was recently donated to the Queensland Museum by Beatrice's granddaughter Ruth, along with a black lace dress the family believes she wore to political functions as it was her only ""good dress"". ""Ruth received the items from her mother Dr Ellen Fraser who became very well known as a medical doctor and passed the items onto her when she passed away,"" Ms Hickson says. ""We know very little about Beatrice, but we do think this shows she was politically engaged and supportive of her husband. ""We often know little about the wives of male politicians; they were very much in the background of their public lives, and it was like this for Beatrice."" Ms Hickson believes the cloth would not have been preserved without the women and wants to pay tribute to them for preserving the story. ""Really it's a women's story as the cloth has been passed down by these women and we wouldn't have this story without them, it's allowed us to see these stories with fresh eyes,"" she says. ""It's been so interesting going back and looking at the members of the time and what they were known for – hopefully we'll be able to solve the mystery of the remaining names.""

89,How people like 101-year-old Effie helped make Victoria 'the heart' of the Greek-Australian community,arts-culture,"  Melbourne Museum celebrates Victoria's rich Hellenic heritage with new exhibition Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog After almost 80 years, a blanket handmade by a then-teenage Effie Spiropoulos still looks as bright as ever. It's a good thing — creating the masterpiece was arduous work, carried out by the light of an oil lamp in a small village in Greece. Effie's daughter Stavroula Spiropoulos said the wool was spun locally, and the dyes dependent on what was at hand, including ""beetroot, onion or walnut husk"". If Effie wanted a particular colour she couldn't make herself, she might make the three-hour walk to the nearest town to try and source it. Only able to weave a piece of cloth as wide as the loom it was on, Effie made two pieces before carefully stitching them together as part of her dowry. When the family of nine migrated to Australia in the 1960s and settled in the Melbourne suburb of Fawkner, the priceless family heirloom came with them. Stavroula, one of Effie's seven children, said it had been carefully looked after ever since. ""Every year with my mum and my sisters we'd air it out and we'd look at it and we'd wonder how this lovely lady with hardly anything from the shops created this,' she said. ""Our precious blanket means so much because it reminds us of my mum and the youth that she had which was filled with difficulty, poverty and hard times and yet she was still able to create and make something beautiful."" A photo of Effie holding the vivid red covering in her Fawkner garden is now on display as part of the museum's Open Horizons exhibition, and the blanket itself has been donated to the museum as well. More than 40 ancient Greek sculptures, bronzes and other precious items — such as a 2,500-year-old sphinx which had never before left Greece, and a colossal head of Zeus standing three-quarters of a metre high — are on show, highlighting themes of culture and connection. Organisers said the exhibition was scheduled for last year to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Greek War of Independence, but COVID saw those plans scrapped. Now that it's open, they are hopeful that by looking to the past, people can have a better understanding of the present. ""There's a lot of connection that can be found between people, whether that's 50 years ago, or whether that's 3,000 years ago,"" Museums Victoria director of exhibitions and audience experiences Linda Sproul said. Greece's National Archaeology Museum's director Anna Vasiliki Karapanagiotou said the works ""tell us many short histories about ancient Greek journeys around the Mediterranean world"", as well as demonstrating the influence they have had on the country's culture. Dr Vasiliki Karapanagiotou said Victoria's large Greek population made it the natural home for the exhibition. ""[The] Melbourne community is a very Greek community, a very vibrant community, and Victoria is the heart of the Greek-Australian community,"" she said. Australia has the third-largest Greek diaspora in the world, with half of the country's close to 100,000 Greek-born residents calling Victoria home. And when officials put a call-out to the local community for photos depicting their own journeys across continents and generations, more than 200 images were sent in. ""We were amazed,"" Ms Sproul said. ""We've got a multimedia display at the end of the exhibition where people have submitted images, and we have themed them across the areas of love, life and work."" Now nearing 102, Effie's life has spanned multiple wars, pandemics and the Great Depression. Stavroula said she would often ask her mother to tell her about her youth, ""and she'd go 'Stavroula, all I remember is work. From the moment we get up to the moment we sleep … it was work, work, work'."" She credited Melbourne's burgeoning Greek community with helping to give her and her siblings a place to belong after arriving from Greece in 1964. ""At school … they couldn't say my name, Stavroula Spiropoulos, it was all Jones and Smith, they tried to change my name,"" she said. ""We stuck together because we couldn't understand … we had a wonderful community."" Despite the difficulties, Stavroula said her mother thrived in her new life -- without forgetting where she came from. ""Even to this day she says Australia is paradise and the best country in the world. But she did also say that Greece is in our heart, and in every fibre of our being,"" she said. ""She's got 22 grandchildren and 30 great-grandchildren and they all call Fawkner home because that is the heart that draws us there. ""As long as mum is there, that's where we all go."" The Spiropoulos family said they were proud to contribute their own piece of very personal Greek-Australian history, donating their mother's blanket to the Melbourne Museum's collection. ""It's survived because when you have very little you treasure what you have,"" she said. ""It gave me great joy that I could share it with the world and mum's legacy could live on.""

93,"After 89 years, it's hoped this worn out yellow Caterpillar can be brought back to life   ",arts-culture,"  Rare K'gari (Fraser Island) relic returns to mainland 89 years after production Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog One of K'gari's (Fraser Island's) iconic relics has been returned to the mainland and put on display at its new home in Hervey Bay. The 89-year-old Caterpillar Diesel Thirty-Five crawler tractor was unveiled at the Hervey Bay Historical Village and Museum today. Only 1,999 of the Cat 35s were manufactured in the early 1930s. At the time of production, it was the first machine to don the iconic 'caterpillar high-way yellow' paint schemes and it's believed to have been the second diesel offering from the manufacturer. President Greg Jacobsen said the machine would become a showpiece at the village. ""It spent all its life hauling logs from Urang Creek to Garry's Anchorage area,"" he said. ""It was retired in 1964 and after a restoration it was handed over to the forestry department in 1994. ""It's been on display up until recently at Central Station."" All five tonnes of the Cat 35 were floated up to K'gari from Brisbane by Richard Smith in 1935, where he began logging trees with his employee and eventual successor Andrew Postan, Senior, who bought the business in 1940. Mr Postan became the sole logging contractor on the Island and continued harvesting trees with the Cat 35. Nearly 90 years on, volunteers at the Historical Village and Museum say the piece of machinery holds significant heritage value. Mr Jacobsen said they were very fortunate to become the beneficiary and custodian of the machine. ""At the time of production, it was probably a step up from the alternative which was probably ox wagons or logging trucks,"" ""They would have thought that it was very innovative in the 30s and being a Caterpillar, it's just gone on and on. ""Our aim is to bring that back up to working condition. We're critically short on two major components – magneto and a carby off the little pilot motor that goes on the machine to start the big diesel motor. ""But we will source those and once we do we'll have that machine up and running. ""It will be a little project but we're determined to get it up and running."" Historical Village and the Museum volunteer Dennis Ross-Jones said the restoration of the machine could take time. ""It was used for logging up until 1964 when logging seized on K'gari,"" he said. ""The trouble is it's been sitting there for 40-odd years and it's starting to rust and falling apart. ""One of the things that was happening was the creek water went into it and there is a lot of sand in the creek water, ""There is fine sand that's in the motor so we've got to flush all that out. ""Queensland Parks and Wildlife have given it to us with the idea that we will get it going and keep it going. ""It was a struggle to get it across from the Island without damaging anything. ""At least its here now and we can look after it and keep it for future generations.""

95,"When Nick bought a $300,000 sculpture to 'give back' to his community, it 'ripped the town in half'",arts-culture,"  At $300,000, public art sculpture Water Cloud has caused a community storm in Dorrigo, NSW Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Nick Wright decided to gift the town of Dorrigo a sculpture, he had no idea of the rift it would cause in the town he loves. ""I wanted to give something to the town that would give me a lot of peace and happiness,"" Mr Wright says, becoming emotional as he recalls the debate. ""And I don't think everyone wanted to accept the gift."" The controversial Water Cloud sculpture has been installed in the main street of the NSW Mid North Coast town after more than eight years of planning. West Australian sculptor Stuart Green designed the work to reflect the essence of the town that has an average annual rainfall of 2,000 millimetres and is known for its World Heritage-listed national parks, rolling waterfalls and lush dairy pastures. The aluminium curves form the shape of a never-ending stream of water that lights up as the sun sets. In 2014 the local council adopted a community public art plan to ""enliven"" towns across the Bellingen Shire, prompting Mr Wright, 82, a local for 20 years, to donate the $300,000 sculpture as a way of giving back to the community. ""I lived on the northern side of town. Whenever I came in, I'd have to cross the bridge and look at the park down along the bank and thought, 'Wouldn't it be nice to see a sculpture there?'"" Mr Wright says. But Mr Wright would soon find out how art can divide opinion. The proposal garnered plenty of debate: from talk in the town to online chatter in community groups. Local Kerry Miller says the artwork has ""ripped the town in half"". ""There are people who are disgusted, you've got people on Facebook yelling at each other. The comments are endless,"" she says. ""Really, more options should have been explored before we made a firm decision. ""My husband drives a truck. He often carts heavy machinery and was able to use this street before, but now with this sculpture in the way, he's not able to access the street anymore."" When Bellingen Shire Council ran a poll during the initial community consultation, nearly 80 per cent of responses were against its installation. Some of the feedback was that the art would be an ""eyesore"" and ""impractical"" for the main strip. Many residents also said it did not reflect the nature of the town. But after it was revealed the initial online portal had received responses from people who didn't live in Dorrigo, the council asked Mr Wright to conduct a second survey himself. That survey returned 177 votes for the artwork and 174 against. Mayor Steve Allan maintains the work went through extensive processes before final approval. ""It is fair to say with any piece of public art, it would have its opposition, but when you think about it, it really does speak to the beautiful natural attributes that Dorrigo is known for including our beautiful waterfalls,"" Mr Allan says. Despite the controversy, some locals believe the sculpture will encourage tourists to stay longer when visiting the town. Rowan Holden, who has lived in Dorrigo for the past 30 years, was initially hesitant about the work, but says he is ""trying to keep an open mind"". ""I didn't think it followed the character of the town but we'll see now it's going up, how it looks,"" he says. ""I'm not sure about the lighting aspect of it."" Sara Hankin, on the other hand, believes the new landmark adds a spark to the town. ""I think it's fantastic! It's an old town, has been old for a very long time, so it's just the change that we need."" Sculptor Stuart Green emphasises the positives. ""I know change is always a bit scary and not everyone is in favour of it, but when you see it in actuality, it is this exciting and different focal point in the centre of town"", he said. ""Nick has given something to the community that is, in its essence, trying to help the town, and that's something positive."" The sculpture has been installed this week, and visitors may now make their own judgement. Mr Wright hopes the town will grow to accept his gift. ""I now think that probably the majority of the town want it, I hope they do,"" he says. ""There are some that don't. Some for good reasons and they're entitled to that.""

96,'It's been the one for 24 years': Final curtain comes down on Adelaide's mecca for emerging actors,arts-culture,"  Adelaide's Bakehouse Theatre to close tonight after 24 years Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Another Adelaide entertainment venue is closing for good, with the city's Bakehouse Theatre shutting its doors this Saturday night, May 7, after 24 years of operation. ""I think the emotions are probably going to start pouring out and then, after that, I guess we'll be wandering around, trying to clear up everything in this place,"" said creative producer Peter Green. The Angas Street theatre had no option but to close when the nearby Life Christian Centre, which owns the property, refused to extend its lease. Life Christian Centre did not respond to the ABC's request for comment. Artistic director Pamela Munt fell in love with the theatre when she and her daughter were given a tour by Green. ""He opened the door and we just sort of looked at each other and said, 'Yeah this is the one',"" she said. ""And it's been the one for 24 years."" With its distinctive red doors, the 86-seat theatre has proven a mecca for actors trying to make it professionally. Having the state's hottest young actors on display attracted plenty of talent scouts over the years. ""They all came to see a lot of the shows that we had here and a lot of the actors who started out here worked in state theatre and other places,"" Green said. ""[It was] such a good grounding."" The city venue has a long, rich history that began, at least officially, when the site was bought in 1890 to be used as a bakery. It went on to be used for Farmers Radio in the 1950s and then became the Communist Party headquarters in 1976. When Green arrived on the scene in the 1990s, the Communist Party still owned it and helped him survive financially. ""They were not very capitalistic when they came to their rent, it was quite reasonable,"" he said. Bakehouse has since been home to around 250 productions attended by thousands of theatre-lovers, with Fringe shows featuring the likes of Ben Elton. However, on Saturday night, the final curtain will come down, and with it will go a critical part of Adelaide's theatre fabric. The city now has a dearth of smaller venues, with the popular La Boheme stage closing its doors three years ago. Just down the road, another long-running venue has also been listed for sale. Diverse-City — formerly known as the Promethean Theatre — has been on the market for several months. Leaseholders Sue and Sarah Gallpen say that, while they have a 10-year lease, that was not an iron-clad guarantee. ""No business environment is ever good when it's in flux and, so, it's more difficult to book an artist when the building is up for sale,"" Sue Gallpen said. But Sue Gallpen said she was confident about the future of Diverse-City, as well as the city's arts and entertainment scene. ""Obviously, for Bakehouse, it's terrible and I would not like to be in the same position but, sometimes, you just have to think in different ways when you're still in the game,"" she said. Munt says the new state government must step in to back an industry that was smashed by COVID-19. ""What it really needs is long-term, secure funding, not just applying for a grant every time you do a show,"" she said. ""It's impossible really."" While unsure if he will be a part of the city theatre scene in the future, Green said he was optimistic about new, emerging venues. ""Somebody will find something and they'll go, 'Let's do it',"" he said, ""and it'll create it again and those people will start. It's like a circle, the arts always seems to go in constant circles."" Bakehouse Theatre is going out with a bang, with every night of its final production of A Streetcar Named Desire sold out.

97,Tasmania's satirical Uni Revue changing with the times as it celebrates 75th anniversary,arts-culture,"  Tasmania's satirical stage show Uni Revue changing with the times as it celebrates 75th anniversary Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For generations, Tasmania's public figures have been at the mercy of one of the state's most beloved traditions: the Uni Revue. The satirical showcase has been putting a theatrical spin on the biggest stories of the years since 1948. This year, the revue celebrates its 75th anniversary with Cassie Xintavelonis at the helm, the first solo female director since the 1990s. Xintavelonis enjoyed her first revue in 1994 but is acutely aware that even beloved traditions need to move with the times. ""A lot of jokes that were from the 80s and 90s would never hold up anywhere or be funny for anyone else these days,"" she said. ""But I think a lot of humour that we're seeing in these pieces is very contemporary. It's current and it's clever rather than the smutty or derogatory humour."" Today's audiences still get a healthy dose of nudity and bawdy wordplay, however, consent training has been introduced to ensure the show is satirical and safe for performers. Xintavelonis said they also embraced a ""collaborative process"" whereby sketches and lyrics were brought to the team to determine whether they were edgy or inappropriate. ""There were quite a few moments this year where collectively we all went, 'Mmm, no, it kind of doesn't make mustard'. So we move on from there,"" she said. ""But certainly we need to look at what's current, what's happening, and what makes us angry and annoyed."" Uni Revue has always aimed to tap into the zeitgeist of Tasmania and beyond, from Cane Toad Dundee in 1987 to Obama Mia! in 2009. This year's show, Net Zero, includes a COVID medley to the Grease soundtrack, with lyrics such as ""I got chills, I think I'm dyin', and I'm losin' my smell"", and a West Side Story sequence that pits Tasmanians against mainlanders. The show opened in Launceston this month but it could be a completely different beast by the time it closes, with sketches re-written depending on the ups and downs of the election campaign. Writer and performer Ben Stoneman said the recent resignation of former premier Peter Gutwein caused a change in direction. ""We're expecting Cassie, our lovely director, to an hour before we go on stage be like, 'Here's a script, learn it, you're doing it at this point',"" Stoneman said. ""And depending on how the election goes, who knows where Scott Morrison's character might end up."" Uni Revue laid its foundations with the creation of the Old Nick Company in 1948. The name was chosen specifically to lampoon The Old Vic Company, which had toured Tasmania with actors Laurence Olivier and Vivienne Leigh the previous year. As the production adapted to the changing political landscape, it also embraced new technology from the introduction of 8mm film projections in the 1970s to an online streamed show in 2020 after theatres closed due to the pandemic. Thousands of actors, writers, technicians, designers, and producers have been involved with The Old Nick Company throughout its history. And while performers come and go, there's always a new generation to keep the tradition alive, such as first-time performer Amaya Smith. ""I really wanted to try something different. I wanted to challenge myself and it certainly has been,"" the 18-year-old said. ""And I feel like the audience just relates to a lot of the issues that we bring up. It just gives them a chance to relax and have a laugh at things you generally wouldn't have a laugh at.""

98,"'Trophies, medals and money don't mean as much as human connection': The philosophy of boxer Harry Garside",arts-culture," Sport Harry Garside prepares to defend his Australian lightweight title — but his priorities go well beyond boxing Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Harry Garside rose to prominence after winning Australia's first Olympic boxing medal in 33 years at the Tokyo Games. It wasn't just that historic bronze, but his painted nails and passion for ballet that won over so many different fans. ""It's been pretty crazy since the Olympics last year,"" Garside said. ""I'm the type of person who tries to grab every opportunity the universe throws at me."" The 24-year-old doesn't shy away from challenges. Just one month after claiming the Australian lightweight title in his second professional bout with a unanimous decision over Manuer Matet in Sydney, Garside is gearing up for his next fight. Australian lightweight boxer Harry Garside was considered an easybeat in his early years in the fight game, but the ballet-dancing plumber from Melbourne has made quite the impression. ""It's a quick turnaround. Not many fighters are doing it these days, but I'm pretty old school with my belief and the way I train,"" he said. Having moved to 2-0 in his professional career, his next opponent is Tasmanian Layton McFerran (5-1) on May 11 at the Newcastle Entertainment Centre. ""I don't know too much about him and have struggled to find footage of him, but he's only lost one of his six fights,"" Garside said. ""He is as tough as nails and he's coming to win."" Garside's triumph over Matet was the first time he fought past three rounds. It was a test of mental endurance as much as physical, and one Garside embraces, as he dreams of one day winning a world title. ""I remember getting to round eight and thinking 'I wish I could sit down', but it felt good, and I was really excited to go 10 rounds,"" he said. ""I can't wait for world titles and boxing 12 rounds."" Garside and Nikita Tszyu are both featured on the undercard of the main event between Paul Gallen (12-1-1) and Kris Terzievski (10-1-1) on Wednesday. Tszyu (1-0), the youngest son of former world champion Kostya and brother to world-ranked Tim, will face Melbourne's Mason Smith (5-0). Former NRL star Gallen and fellow Australian heavyweight Terzievski will be aiming to create Australian boxing history, with the winner to be crowned with dual titles for the first time in more than 100 years. Garside credits Gallen for what he has done for the sport of boxing and providing young fighters like himself a platform. He said he could not wait to fight under Gallen. ""The best thing I love about Paul Gallen is what you see is what you get,"" Garside said. ""He speaks his mind, he's unapologetically Paul Gallen."" Garside has an unassuming confidence and the former plumber from Melbourne's eastern suburbs is proudest for being known as the ballet dancing boxer. The youngest of three boys, Garside wanted to do ballet and dance for many years but was too afraid to tell his dad and older brothers. ""I finally built up the courage in 2019 to start ballet and I absolutely love it,"" he said. ""It's helped my boxing heaps and one day when I'm good enough I will do a performance for sure."" While Garside can pack a pirouette as well as he does a punch, he wants to be known as more than just a boxer. Over the past two years, he has been focused on separating his boxing persona from his authentic self. ""At the end of the day, trophies, medals and money don't mean as much to me [as] human connection does,"" he said. ""At the end of my life, I want to be remembered as a good person, rather than a good boxer."" Sporting nails painted with different colours, Garside's mission to break gender stereotypes came from his own struggles and he hopes it inspires young people to embrace their quirks. ""There were so many things pushed on me when I was growing up about how I was supposed to act,"" he said. ""By painting my nails, I hope young people can see that I don't have to play the roles society pushes on me and I can be who I am."" Garside credits the Reach foundation, a youth not-for-profit organisation aimed at building social and emotional development, for giving him the courage to be comfortable in his own skin. ""They came to my school when I was 16 years old,"" he said. ""My involvement with them took me on a journey where I learnt to love myself — the good, the bad and ugly."" One of his life goals is to get combat sports integrated into the school system. While boxing may be high risk, Garside believes lower-impact versions, such as judo and jiu-jitsu, could be suitable alternatives. ""I remember as a young person going through a lot between the ages of 10 to 18 years,"" he said.

100,How Vogue's first Indigenous cover model Elaine George paved the way for a new era,arts-culture,"  How Vogue's first Indigenous cover model Elaine George paved the way for a new era Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When 17-year-old Elaine George posed for the cover of Vogue Australia in 1993, becoming the first Indigenous model to do so, the enormity of the situation was entirely lost on her. Yet that image would prove to be a turning point in the representation of First Nations Australians at home and abroad, where Ms George says some people ""didn't know they existed"". It was a moment brought about by pure chance. Elaine, now Elaine Tanaka, grew up in housing commission in south-west Brisbane. Her mother is Arakwal from Byron Bay, part of the Bundjalung nation in northern New South Wales, and her father's ancestry is German. She had saved up to take her younger sister Anita to Dreamworld and was waiting in line for a ride when she was noticed by photographer Grant Good and his partner Diana Finke. ""This lady was following me everywhere and I ended up confronting her and asking her to stop following us,"" she said. The woman – Ms Finke – explained that she was a talent scout and handed Ms George a napkin with a number, asking if she was interested in modelling. The Brisbane-based teenager dismissed the interaction as ""a bit dodgy"" and it wasn't until her mum found the napkin in her pocket and called Ms Finke that she agreed to have her photograph taken. ""They said they'd like to send it to Vogue to see if they were interested and I never knew what Vogue was,"" she said. ""We didn't grow up with magazines like that. ""So when they called and said, 'Do you want to shoot for the front cover?' I had no idea what they actually meant. ""My first job in modelling was actually the front cover of Vogue."" The fallout was a ""whirlwind"" with Ms George giving interviews across all the major media outlets. At age 18, Ms George's modelling took her to the United States where she was not only considered ""old"" for the industry but was also confronted with a great deal of ignorance around her heritage and her country's history. ""I had to keep telling everybody that I was a First Nations model from Australia,"" she said. ""They actually didn't know that Australia had Aboriginal people in their country, they just though it was the Gold Coast [cliché] of blonde hair, blue eyes. ""So I was kind of educating the world as well that we are the oldest living culture in the world and America didn't even know that we existed."" Ms George was signed with one of Australia's biggest modelling agencies, Chadwick Models, after Vogue decided she would make the cover. Peter Chadwick said it was a ""huge"" moment for the fashion industry. ""The cover picture looked extraordinary,"" he said. ""I just looked and thought, 'Yes, she's got a great look and she could do well' and then on top of that she was First Nations so that was an added bonus."" But with the instant fame came enormous pressure, and after months of missing her family, home and community, Ms George made the difficult decision to walk away from the fashion industry. She spent the next three decades and counting working as a child protection officer, helping foster carers with Aboriginal children make sure they stay connected to their family, culture and community. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC North Coast's weekly email newsletter. ""A lot of First Nations families struggle through the Stolen Generations and I wanted to make sure that future children had a better outcome in life than my own family [which was] part of the Stolen Generations."" While Ms George paved the way for First Nations models to appear on the cover of leading fashion magazines, it would be another 17 years before the next Indigenous model, Samantha Harris, would appear on the cover of Vogue. ""I thought it was beautiful [but] I was a little disappointed it took 17 years,"" Ms George said. Fast forward to May 2022, and the cover of Vogue Australia is a stunning quartet of First Nations women designed and styled by First Nations fashion creatives. All four models — Elaine George, Charlee Fraser, Magnolia Maymuru and Cindy Rostron – are part of the First Nations Fashion + Design mentorship program, which is a non-profit that aims to give Indigenous creatives a voice. When Ms George agreed to come out of nearly three decades of retirement to pose for the cover, she said it was because Vogue ""really understood"" what it meant to be a First Nations woman. ""I think it [the cover] represents the true First Nations people of Australia,"" she said. ""There have been questions over the years of 'Oh, you're not Aboriginal because you're too white' or 'you don't have those typical stereotype features'. ""[But] on this cover, it represents all First Nations women around Australia and we're all from different mobs. ""Not only do we have the cover, but we have awesome Aboriginal designers and Aboriginal crew that were on the shoot as well."" Far from an isolated event, First Nations talent will feature heavily at this year's Australian Fashion Week, which starts on Monday. The official closing event will be a runway show produced, styled, modelled and staffed by an all-Indigenous cast and crew. Reflecting on her role in helping to change public perceptions and understanding around First Nations Australians, Ms George acknowledged there had been positive change over the years, but said there was still a long way to go. ""Right now there's still a lot of people around the world that don't know [about] First Nations peoples in Australia,"" she said. ""We actually don't even have a public holiday for First Nations people [even though] we have one for the Ekka [in Queensland] and Labour Day. ""I think that would be a great start.""

101,The hit online music show helping keep remote Indigenous students in school,arts-culture,"  VAMPtv online music program showcasing talents of remote NT Indigenous students Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Every fortnight, a small team of producers gather in a cramped music studio in Darwin. Inside, they're filming episodes for the popular online music show know as VAMPtv, or Video, Arts, Music, Production Television. Now in its 12th season, the program provides a platform for Indigenous students from across the Northern Territory's regional and remote communities to showcase their musical talents. One of them is Alvin Manfong, from the Mulga Bore band. The 17-year-old and his band come from from the tiny remote community of Mulga Bore, about 140 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs. Drawing inspiration from the iconic American rock band Kiss, the band won last month's Alice Springs heat of the ""Battle of the School Bands"" final. Alvin said he had dreams of making it big on the global stage. ""[I want to] tour with the band, make albums [and] get more costumes,"" he said. Primary school teacher Courtney Bailey joined VAMPtv as its main host shortly after the show's inception in 2011. ""There are so many talented kids out there that can play music,"" she said. ""Kids seeing other kids from all around the Territory [on VAMPtv] … they might recognise family and say 'I reckon I could give that a go.' ""VAMPtv and all the great things that we do, it's really amplifying black excellence."" Students write and record their own songs and music videos, which are then submitted to producers at the NT Music school, before being featured on the show. Episodes can then be viewed online. VAMPtv Creative Director Todd Williams said the idea was initially conceived by former NT Music School principal Andy Mison, with the aim of boosting student engagement in regional and remote schools amid chronically low attendance rates. ""We wanted to make it enjoyable … and to put Indigenous kids in the spotlight amongst themselves,"" Mr Williams said. ""Music has a wonderful way of working and developing the brain and making learning more enjoyable and engaging."" The program is funded by the NT Department of Education and reaches more than 120 remote schools across the Northern Territory. ""[VAMPtv] helps to make a culture of school being a place where these students are valued for who they are and the talents that they come with,"" NT Music School Liaison Rodney Balaam said. The program also looks to provide students with pathways to a career in music. Mr Williams said King Stingray frontman Yirrnga Yunupingu was the show's ""poster boy"" in its formative years. ""[Since] first coming across him [Yirrnga] in 2011 when he was 15 years old, we have seen him develop with all the different bands he's been in,"" Mr Williams said. ""We've seen him grow and blossom to the amazing young man he is now.""

102,"Ballerina gives up pointe shoes for working boots, and a new life in the outback",arts-culture,"  Ballerina turned outback jillaroo loving life on the land, new career in agriculture Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Despite growing up on a farm in South Australia, Poppy Kentish had no desire to work on the land as a kid. Ballet was her life. ""I started when I was three years old, just in a little school out of Mount Gambier in South Australia and I loved it,"" Poppy says. ""When I was 10, I danced five nights a week and was having the best time ever."" Dancing created a clear path for Poppy, who moved to Adelaide for more opportunities, but it wasn't an easy road. ""We worked hard, it didn't come easy for me. I really had to work for my flexibility and I spent countless days after school crying because I couldn't get it,"" she says. ""Every night after school I would be there until 9pm, and when I was in year 11 and 12 I would actually get [time off] studies so I could do half a day at school and half a day of dancing. ""It's one of those industries that it is so rough on your mentality,"" Poppy says. ""Unless you're headstrong, it just won't work for you. ""That's probably what I got out of it the most: [learning] … how strong-minded I am."" Poppy persisted with her training and in 2020 was accepted into the New Zealand School of Dance to further her studies. ""It was just the best fun ever, we lived and breathed it. I'm still in contact with the mates I had there,"" Poppy says. ""It was quite like having a crew here, you know, you live together and you work together on the station."" When she returned to Australia, Poppy took a road trip with her dad, and got a taste of station life. ""I joined Dad on a little station-hop. I've always wanted to come up here [to north-west Queensland] but didn't think it was something I was able to do,"" she says. ""But totally immersing myself [in the outback] with Dad, I just fell in love with it. ""So when I came back, I jumped in my ute and worked my way up."" Poppy says the trip changed her perspective. ""I felt so claustrophobic at home; I was able to breathe up here,"" Poppy says. ""I could have gone on to audition for the Sydney Dance Company or Queensland Ballet, but I'm so glad I made this choice."" Now working for Australian Agricultural Company in Julia Creek, Poppy is a jillaroo, mustering cattle on horseback and motorbike. She plans to continue her career in agriculture and is excited about the innovation in the industry. ""People ask me, 'How did you get up and move?' but I'm constantly hunting that growth of mindset,"" Poppy says. ""That's all I'm really about … finding more and more ways to make myself a better person. ""It is so cliche, but it really is, you know, growing yourself. ""The moment you stop, do you just become boring? You've got no stories to tell. So yeah, I'm all about the stories.""

""I'm 20 years old and I'm able to do all these things now. I'd say to people, 'Just do it'.

103,Song composed for Sydney Olympics discovered in old drawer and finally brought to life,arts-culture,"  Song composed for 2000 Sydney Olympics finally brought to life by Forster man, in honour of late wife Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It was the year 2000 and Sydney was preparing to host the Olympics when music lover and composer Natalie Raab decided to create a uniquely Australian song. Her hope was that the ballad-style piece, celebrating Australia's beauty, and modern and ancient cultures, could be featured somewhere during the Sydney Olympics. Ms Raab had fallen in love with Australia after moving from Italy with her family in 1960 and had been involved with Indigenous students through her work as a high school teacher in Sydney. ""My wife was always very musical,"" her husband, Erich Raab said. ""She wrote quite a bit of music for some well-known artists, she played the violin, the guitar, the piano, and she studied music from an early age. ""She thought, 'I better write a song that's for everybody and inclusive of Indigenous Australia and offer it as a gift'."" Ms Raab offered the song to the Sydney Olympic Committee three months before the games. Mr Raab said the committee members praised the song but said it was too late to incorporate it into their program. ""They loved it, they absolutely loved it, but they had already completed their program for the Sydney games,"" he said. ""After that, it disappeared in a drawer somewhere — forgotten."" The song stayed in that drawer for more than 20 years, until last year when Mr Raab discovered it during a clean-up of his home at Forster, on the NSW Mid North Coast. Ms Raab died in 2014 in a motorcycle accident and Mr Raab was eager to see her song shared with others. ""She was a very outdoors sort of a girl … she died riding her motorbike after coming back from a ride to Alice Springs,"" he said. ""When I found the music, I thought, 'This song in a few verses says everything that needs to be said about this country, its beauty, its natural history, its people history, and its emphasis on reconciliation for all'. ""I thought, 'I have to hang on to this and see if I can get somebody interested'."" Mr Raab engaged a singer to perform the song and shared it on YouTube initially, before gifting it to the Manning Valley Choral Society. The Choral Society has now performed the song, called Till I Come Home, as part of a concert series, and also made a recording of the music. ""They are lovely people,"" Mr Raab said. ""They immediately understood what the song was about, they loved the music and thought it suited them, and they loved the words."" The Manning Valley Choral Society's Robyn Rankin said they gratefully received the music. ""Erich asked us if we would take care of it and record it for him,"" she said. ""We are lucky enough to have it in our possession now … it's a tribute to Erich's wife."" Mr Raab was thrilled to see his wife's music shine and hoped the song would be widely shared. ""It's a fond memory I have,"" he said. ""It would sadden me to see this beautiful song lost … it's for anybody who wants to have it to enjoy.""

104,Spider-Man's Sam Raimi can't save Marvel's crowd-pleasing but creatively lacklustre latest,arts-culture,"  Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: Benedict Cumberbatch and Sam Raimi team up for Marvel's crowd-pleasing but creatively lacklustre latest Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Last year's monster-hit Spider-Man: No Way Home unleashed the limitless – or terrifying, depending on your perspective – possibilities of the MCU's multiverse, a world in which every character you've ever known, loved, or rolled your eyes at could be employed in franchise perpetuity; where old villains and heroes could be resurrected, and the only real mortality came at the hands of an actor's expired contract. Marvel's latest, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, is here to double down on that feeling of either delight or terror, delivering another trip into the infinitely expanding, if curiously unimaginative, realm of multiple realities and franchise favourites dusted off for renewed screen service (at least until their deepfake doppelgangers can be perfected). It's been six years since the first Doctor Strange, though we've seen plenty of the character since: in Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, and in No Way Home, where Benedict Cumberbatch's goateed sorcerer – who throws magic hand shapes like a reject from a ballroom voguing contest – played a pivotal if accidental role in opening the portal to the MCU's multiple realities. Note: This review contains spoilers. In Multiverse of Madness, Strange is brooding at the marriage of his ex, Dr Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), when a gigantic one-eyed octopus – not unlike the goofy starfish that enlivened last year's Suicide Squad – crashes into Midtown Manhattan, hell-bent on capturing a teenage girl, America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez). Decked out in a faded denim jacket emblazoned with stars, stripes, and a rainbow flag pin – Chavez is canonically queer, much to the chagrin of Disney's international accountants – she's an all-powerful entity in the shape of a girl, gifted with the ability to move through the multiverse. Naturally, nefarious parties want a piece of America's talent, especially Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), the villainous alter ego of ex-Avenger Wanda Maximoff, whose would-be peaceful suburban life is about to be disrupted by her old, evil self. In pursuit of her prize, Scarlet Witch manages to kidnap Strange's mentor, Wong (Benedict Wong), but the Doctor and America escape her clutches, tumbling through a kaleidoscopic montage and into the New York of another universe – an oddly utopian city that resembles the future as imagined by an 80s movie. Unlike the CGI-soaked tedium and misshapen auteurism of much of the recent MCU, Multiverse of Madness is elevated – if barely – by the singular spirit of director Sam Raimi, the kinetic filmmaker behind the Evil Dead series, Drag Me to Hell and, of course, the 2002-2007 trilogy of Spider-Man movies that helped jump-start this century's superhero cinema cycle. Raimi's Spider-Man movies were playful pop confections mostly unburdened by the weight of endless sequel phases and IP world-building, shot through with a genuine sense of comic-book fun – and crucially, compelling characterisation – that's become increasingly hard to find in Marvel's charmless content factory. Multiverse of Madness is at its best – unsurprisingly – when it yields to Raimi's flourishes: canted angles, jump-scare eyeballs, a Bruce Campbell cameo (that's not a spoiler – he's not an MCU character, at least not yet). The darker the film gets, the more Raimi it is: a sequence involving zombie possession and a sorcerous lair stalked by demons and dark souls is as close to Evil Dead as we're ever likely to get in a movie of this budget, while Raimi's Spider-Man composer Danny Elfman returns with a stomping score that, on occasion, manages to give the visuals some operatic ballast. ""I'm going to show those kids how to make a superhero picture,"" Raimi joked to Rolling Stone of his return to the Marvel fold, and in these moments, well, you really want to believe him. But Raimi has become a stranger in a not-so-strange land. The filmmaker, who with Darkman (1990) demonstrated a feel for the tragedy inherent in the genre, can't compete with the rote procession of one-liners and franchise call-backs in Loki writer Michael Waldron's screenplay, or a convoluted plot that fails to raise any compelling stakes, set in a world where everything seems to exist for Pavlovian fan response. Granted, it's a movie for the fans, but the crowd-pleasing comes at the expense of developing its characters and allowing its actors to explore; of finding interesting dimensions and conflict in the story. The film's dive into the multiverse should up-end all of our expectations and challenge an audience's familiarity with this franchise, but it mostly just functions as another quest to be checked off, a safe moral battleground between good and evil in which the heroes and villains are never in doubt. There's not even an alternate-universe cameo from Bronco Henry. Compared with that other recent trip to the multiverse, Daniels's scatological but heartfelt Everything Everywhere All at Once, Multiverse of Madness looks pedestrian in its conceit; narratively and visually, it fails to imagine a world that feels surreal or dangerous, turning the head-spinning possibilities of the infinite into a diagrammatic action dirge where characters bark clunkers like ""Get out of my universe!"" As America, trapped in a cell in an alternate world, snaps at one point: ""This universe sucks!"" Cumberbatch, Wong, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, returning as Strange's mystic rival Mordo, are all charismatic performers who bring moments of wit and levity, but they're not playing characters as much as they are performing exposition, action figures, cynical soda cup portraits. (Attempting to enlist Wanda in his mission, Strange even promises her, ""We'll get you back on a lunchbox."") Gomez is a spirited addition to the film, even if America Chavez seems more like a set-up for future instalments; at the same time, her character's name does provide some of the film's best unintentional laughs (""America, I've come here to tell you to trust yourself,"" says Strange at one point, with a bravely straight face). The one vaguely interesting performance comes from Olsen, who's given some material to chew as the split-personality villain of the piece. Still, there's something deeply discomfiting, almost misogynistic, about the way her character is written – a tiresome variation on wholesome, maternal purity versus the pagan 'other' – that undermines the actor's best attempts to elicit empathy. Moments in which various men doubt the authenticity of the character's claims to motherhood land with an unpleasant odour – not the kind of reaction the movie would hope to court in the current charged climate. It's enough to make you want Scarlet Witch to run away with the film, and take down some of these virtuous, wisecracking bores in the process. But Multiverse of Madness is not that movie, and try as Raimi might, there's only so much directorial verve he can bring to a project designed to erect another stone in the wall of Marvel's Phase 4, to wrangle a story that's at once complicated and incredibly dull. Is it successful on its own terms, as a movie for the fans? Sure. Probably. Who's to say? Multiverse of Madness doesn't need to appeal to the uninitiated since most audiences are already in the bag for its schtick. If you've ever felt yourself sinking slowly into your multiplex seat while the crowd whooped and hollered at the mere appearance of a character you barely recognised – much less cared about – then this movie, like so much of the recent Marvel Cinematic Universe, is not for you. But the bubble has to burst at some point. By the time Raimi's film is piling on the cameos from Marvel properties past and present, there's a sense that this universe – shrunk to a playpen of revolving corporate interests – might finally be about to collapse in upon itself. When that does happen, maybe it's time for a new generation to embrace new heroes – or, better yet, none at all. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is in cinemas now.

105,"Nudism, activism, vacuuming pets: over three decades, there's no topic Life Matters has turned its back on",arts-culture,"  Over 30 years of Life Matters, bravery and honesty have been a constant in countless stories of joy and pain Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Over the last 20 years, I can't tell you how many times I've had people say to me, 'Look, I've never told anyone this'. Ever since Life Matters started in 1992, and certainly since I joined the team in 2000, we've interviewed countless celebrities, politicians, authors, artists and academics. Life Matters is here to help you get a handle on all the important stuff: love, sex, fitness, health, parenting, career, finances and family. But for me, what makes the show special is its relationship with the listeners. They give us their heart and soul, and they're so honest. I'm often asked why people tell us the things they do, on air particularly. I think they feel there's a certain amount of anonymity in being on the show, even though it's exactly the opposite of that. Still, they must trust us. Over the years, the listeners have shared their deepest feelings and traumas, along with their triumphs. And there have been so many truly amazing moments that I will never forget. Here are some of them. One of the early segments I produced was called Meet the Listener, and some of those who took part were willing to bare all, sometimes quite literally. Shirley was our ""social nudist"". After going through a divorce, a friend suggested she get out and meet some men — by joining the local nudist club. This was the late 1970s and Shirley, then in her 40s, did just that. She told me the first day was very challenging with the unisex change rooms. ""I was approached by a lovely older man, a bank manager, who asked, 'May I wash your back?' and I said yes!"" ""At that age, my late 40s, I wasn't about to refuse any offers,"" she laughingly said. Shirley was 81 when she came on our program, and she had been through cancer and a double mastectomy — and she was still an active member of the club. The listeners also often share stories of great resilience. I remember talking to Jane, who was in her 50s when she travelled to Bali where she suffered an arterial embolism while going for a walk. It cut off her blood supply instantly, causing her foot and lower leg to die, and she had to have her leg amputated. Her stories about how she dealt with this were incredible. She spoke about how something deep inside her mind motivated her to get herself together, to muster all her strength, to face this misfortune with everything she had. And of course, there are the funny stories. There are so many hilarious moments working on a daily radio program, but while I was delving into the archives for Life Matters' 30th Birthday project, I came across an interview with a woman who would regularly vacuum her cat. That had me in stitches. It was part of a series on pets and their owners. Her cat Jezebel, who was very much a central figure in her life, was also known to have a string of Tom cat suitors. Part of my job as a producer is to get people to open up and share their stories. I approach this as a conversation, and often I end up sharing bits of my life. We form a bond and usually that's how we find the best stories. I have had countless chats with fascinating strangers. Everyone has a story to tell. Sometimes those chats turned into real connections. In 2006, I interviewed Anne, a hearing-impaired woman who lives between Australia and Turkey. We had such a connection that she invited me over to Turkey. Two friends went to visit instead of me and they sent me photos of them all sipping gin and tonics on her verandah. They even had the audacity to call me on my birthday — that was such a wonderful surprise. Another guest was Romana, whom I called the accidental expat. She was living in France and tuning in to the program each day. While on holiday, Romana had met and married a Frenchman in a whirlwind fashion after meeting him at a Buddhist meditation class. She relocated to Toulouse in the south of France. While I was there on a trip, I met up with her for coffee and a spot of shoe shopping, which was fabulous. Then there are those moments that really make you think about your life. I still remember the interview we did with Ingrid Betancourt, the Columbian-French politician who was held hostage in the jungle for six years by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as the Farc. When her captors demanded that she be known as merely a number she refused, instead insisting they call her by name. This act of defiance very nearly had her killed but she knew if she succumbed to being just a number, they would have won and she would lose herself. Her story really made me consider how important it is to value your own worth. Talkbacks with the listeners are always full of surprises. Sometime people will want to vent their anger. They're passionate about the issue that we've been talking about, maybe how the segment's been dealt with or how it resonates with their life. Once Magda Szubanski called in on the talkback line. Another time, when we were doing a talkback on handwriting, cricketer Max Walker dialled in to tell us about his favourite fountain pen. It is always surprising to find out who is listening to the program. Often our talkback callers became guests later, like the compulsive protester, 85-year-old Marty Morrison, who first called into a talkback we did on activism. She was up to fight for all manner of causes with all her signs ready to go. She even brought them into the studio when we invited her on in 2014. Life Matters has been a pretty fearless program over the years and we've covered all manner of amazing topics. We did a talkback on masturbation once, and it went off! Listeners have sometimes revealed some shocking things. For example, we got a letter from someone who was in an intimate relationship with her brother. They couldn't tell anyone and had left their hometown, changed their names and were living as a couple in a town where no-one knew they were related to each other. Reading that handwritten letter still sticks in my mind. There have been a lot of sad stories too. Former presenter Richard Aedy and I were chatting about the stories we've covered over the years. One segment that stood out was called Bear is Now Asleep. The guest was William Verity who had lost his three-year-old daughter India in a freak soccer goal accident. Richard and I and the entire team were so moved by that story, and particularly by William's honesty. We were in awe of how he and his wife Caroline coped with India's death and the subsequent fall-out from the tragedy, and despite this, he managed to find a silver lining. Listening to people's stories can sometimes take its toll. Being an ear to people's grief and listening to some of their life challenges and circumstances can be difficult. A psychologist who'd been a guest on one of our talkbacks once asked me if I ever debriefed after hearing all these stories. I had to say no. He said: ""You are probably carrying a lot of people's traumas"". Over the years, stories seem to come back around again and again. We are constantly reliving the same issues and asking the same questions, no matter what the year. But the answers can change so much. For example, the question of how to be a good parent never goes away. In the early 2000s, it was about free-range style, or what was deemed ""benign neglect"", for example, lots of tree climbing sans supervision. Then along came helicopter parenting and constantly hovering over your children. I remember a wonderful interview we did in 2009 with New York mum Lenore Skenazy, author of Free Range Kids. She had been labelled ""the world's worst mum"" for allowing her son to ride the subway alone when he was nine years old. But she sparked a whole movement. A few years later, we interviewed Amy Chua who wrote Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. This ushered in the era of the Tiger Mum, a fairly strict parenting philosophy. These days, I think parents are more often judged, which puts a lot of pressure on them to feel they are ""doing it right"". That's tough. But sometimes it's a relief that things have changed. For example, one of the guests we had on in the early days of the program was transwoman Katherine Cummins, who had transitioned when she was in her 50s. Recently I listened back to the interview she did with Geraldine Doogue, and I thought about how far we've come in accepting and embracing gender fluidity in 2022. It's still a topic for discussion, but back then, it would have just been so difficult. It's certainly more open and more recognised, even though there's still a way to go. I've learnt so much working on Life Matters. Every story, every book, every conversation has taught me something. And the various producers and presenters I've seen join the party over the years have always enriched the program. Being on the show is constant learning and the variety of material Life Matters has brought to air since its inception is truly never-ending. I'm always ready to be blown away by the next guest, conversation, story or unexpected sage advice that the program brings. And I know there will always be something new tomorrow.

108,"Emerging artist wins big for portrait of Thor director Taika Waititi, kicking off Archies season",arts-culture,"  Archibald Packing Room Prize goes to portrait of Taika Waititi by emerging artist Claus Stangl Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Sydney artist Claus Stangl's painting of Aotearoa New Zealand filmmaker, actor and comedian Taika Waititi has won the Archibald Prize's Packing Room Prize — kicking off 'Archies season' in Sydney. It is Stangl's second time as an Archibald finalist, having previously been selected in 2020 for his portrait of Sydney hip hop artist L-FRESH The LION. The UK-born painter said ""he couldn't believe it"" when Waititi agreed to sit for him, having sent the director a detailed ""treatment"" of ideas for the portrait while he was shooting the forthcoming Marvel blockbuster Thor: Love and Thunder in Sydney. ""I didn't hear anything for for a few weeks ... and [then] I got the phone call on a Wednesday and was told that he's available Friday, so I had one day to get my act together. But it came out trumps,"" Stangl said. ""I've admired his work for so many years,"" he said, dating his admiration back to watching Waititi's film Boy in 2010. Stangl's portrait of Waititi is one of 52 finalists in one of Australia's longest-running and richest awards, with a prize pool of $108,000. Announcing the winner of the Packing Room Prize, head packer Brett Cuthbertson, who has the deciding vote, said Waititi had a ""vision and a twisted sense of humour that we all need right now"" in a ""world full of war and COVID — it's pretty miserable at times"". He also announced that 2022 is his last year in the role, as he is retiring after 41 years. This year's Archibald Prize exhibition, which will open to the public on May 14, reflects the issues that have preoccupied many Australians over the last two years, including COVID, natural disasters and climate change. Anne Ryan, long-serving curator of the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes, said she was surprised to see that these issues ""are [only just] coming to the fore a little bit more now"". ""I think artists have had time to sort of percolate on some of these big things that have impacted on us all. And so the people that they're choosing to paint are people who are really kind of standing up and making a difference — whether that's in the sphere of the environment, or in the sphere of political change."" She pointed to 2018 Archibald winner Yvette Coppersmith's portrait of young climate activist Ella Simons, and Sydney painter Blak Douglas's portrait of fellow artist and friend Karla Dickens, who lives in NSW's Northern Rivers, and is depicted standing in floodwaters while holding a leaking bucket full of water in each hand. (Dickens told ABC Arts in April that the holes in the buckets symbolise the government's inaction on climate change.) Artist Jude Rae chose to paint Australian engineer and inventor Saul Griffith, the author of The Big Switch: Australia's Electric Future, and a former climate and energy adviser to US President Joe Biden. Anh Do, host of ABC TV's Anh's Brush With Fame, painted Midnight Oil frontman and former Labor cabinet minister Peter Garrett, a longtime advocate for climate action. Ryan says the Archibald Prize is unusual in that it's not just about great painting — it's also about reflecting contemporary Australian society. ""So it's got the extra level, about who is painted [and] the stories of the people that the artists have chosen to paint."" Close attention is paid to the gender breakdown of the Archibald Prize each year, and the other ways in which it reflects the diversity of Australian artists and society. This year, the prize slipped from the precise gender parity of 2021 to a 42 to 58 per cent split between women and men finalists; however across the three prizes — including the Wynne and Sulman finalists — men and women were equally represented in 2022. It was a banner year for Indigenous Australian participation in the prize, with 20 of the 816 Archibald entries — the highest known number according to the Art Gallery of NSW — by Aboriginal artists. Of these, the three chosen by the judges were previous finalist Blak Douglas (aka Adam Hill), a self-taught painter of Dhungutti and Irish-Australian heritage, with his painting of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens; Western Arrernte artist and 2020 winner Vincent Namatjira, with another self-portrait; and Daniel Boyd — an established artist of Kudjla/Gangalu heritage, making his Archibald debut with a portrait of Western Sydney drill rap group OneFour. Curator Anne Ryan says the prize is becoming more reflective of Australia in other ways, and points to the high number of Archibald finalists this year from Sydney's Studio A, which supports artists living with intellectual disability. Thom Roberts and Emily Crockford, who were first-time finalists in 2021 and 2020 respectively, made the cut again in 2022, alongside fellow Studio A artists Meagan Pelham and Catherine McGuiness. ""They're creating some really fun and interesting and kind of fascinating paintings,"" Ryan said of the Studio A contingent. This year is also notable for the high proportion of first-time finalists — ""which I always find very refreshing,"" says Ryan. ""It's always wonderful to see the work of artists that you don't know."" Exhibitions for the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes will open on Saturday May 14 at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

109,"‘It’s like a family’: Once a convent, this gallery is helping art thrive outside the city",arts-culture,"  Gayndah Art Gallery in former convent a congregation space for Queensland's oldest town Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog If you step outside the city confines, a wealth of creativity and artistic talent is on display in regional Queensland. It may just be a little harder to find. And while artists may have fewer resources in the regions, a gallery in Queensland's oldest town, Gayndah, is trying to shift the narrative. It has grabbed the attention of newcomers and visitors alike. Housed in a former Catholic convent, the Gayndah Art Gallery has become the place of worship for the North Burnett town's creative spirit since it opened 10 years ago. Like the rest of regional Queensland, the town has experienced a big growth in new residents. For a town traditionally famous for its citrus, its burgeoning art scene is playing an important role in its vibrancy. Regular events such as ""paint and sip"" and exhibition openings are connecting newcomers with long-time locals. Gallery president Jane Glenn says newcomers have pivoted into the space. ""I've half a dozen come up to the gallery who have moved recently to town, and they are joining up as friends of Gayndah Art Gallery,"" she said. ""They can't fail to be impressed by the building and standard of the artwork."" The centre is run entirely on the love of its volunteers and, while the space is small, it's making a big impression. ""I think it's encouraged a whole lot of artists, young and old, to pick up their pens and brushes and create wonderful art,"" Ms Glenn said. ""It's created a fantastic community hub, not just for art but for social reasons. ""I think it's an extremely important asset for the community."" The North Burnett region, west of Bundaberg, takes in the towns of Gayndah, Biggenden, Eidsvold, Monto, Mt Perry, and Mundubbera. Artist Susie Capewell has called Gayndah home since 2007 and was considering opening her own gallery when she heard of the space opening. For Capewell, the gallery is the main consideration on why she will always call Gayndah home. ""It's like a family, this gallery and the volunteers,"" she said. ""We all love each other. ""Our functions are like our little social get-togethers."" Having the chance to hang art on the wall has also been a big win for the region's creatives, with 60 exhibitions being hung since the gallery has been open. The former convent sits in the grounds of St Joseph's Primary School and the school shares the building with the volunteers. Ms Glenn credits a former principal at the school for encouraging students to have access to the arts. ""The vision to turn this into an arts and culture centre was the vision of Liam and Michelle Dougherty,"" Ms Glenn said. ""He said all the children around Gayndah have wonderful opportunities around sport, great opportunities academically, but they had not much exposure to arts and culture. ""We want to continue that interest."" And it's not just the local kids the gallery is helping. It recently launched the Arthur Marshall Emerging Artist Award to honour a former volunteer who died, as well as provide educational support with exhibitions and funding. Capewell says the town's emerging artists saw the benefits of having a dedicated art space and she encourages others to get involved. ""Even if they have little interest in art, come and attend one of our workshops,"" she said. ""You might find you have the spark there and want to go on and learn more. ""And that's what we want to promote."" Ms Glenn hopes the children showing their work now will return in the future to show growth and share their stories through art. ""In 10 years' time, I would like to see their artwork hanging on these walls,"" she said. ""I want to see them inspired to learn and to take all the opportunities they can. ""And then come back and display their work in an exhibition."" ABC Wide Bay will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

110,"Mary Coustas may be taking to the most prestigious stage in the land, but for the creator of Effie, This Is Personal",arts-culture,"  Effie creator Mary Coustas brings This Is Personal stage show to the Sydney Opera House Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Effie's dream is finally coming true. The larger-than-life Greek Goddess with her big hair and even bigger personality has held a place in our hearts for decades. It started with Wogs Out of Work and then morphed into the popular TV sitcom Acropolis Now. She's played to full theatres across the country, leaving audiences crying with laughter. But there was always one stage that felt off-limits. ""So much of my work has been around race and being seen and belonging, no matter where you are, and that you deserve to be in any room,"" Effie's creator Mary Coustas says. Which is why, when she stands on the stage at the Sydney Opera House at the end of May, it will be an incredibly powerful moment for a woman who has refused to accept that anything is beyond her reach. And she wants to look out at the audience and see herself reflected. ""I want all the Greeks there, all the gays there, no matter where they're from, anyone who has felt for any reason … that going to the Opera House was beyond them, that there was a certain type that goes there and it wasn't them."" ""One of my good friends, whose dad worked there his whole life, used to be woken up at 5am by her mum so they could drop him off at stage door. ""She grew up running around the corridors, but she never saw a show there."" Her friend will be in the audience this month. Behind the scenes for a traumatic decade, Mary Coustas underwent 23 gruelling IVF attempts, 18 with donor eggs, and grieved the loss of her daughter, Stevie, who was stillborn in 2011. When her daughter, Jamie, was born eight and a half years ago, Mary's story became public and her audiences found another reason to love her. They would approach Effie, in full character, and want to talk to 'Mary', to break through the barrier Coustas had created. ""Effie has been my comedic human shield but I realised people were invested in Mary, they wanted to hear more of her."" So it will be 57-year-old Mary Coustas who steps on stage at the Opera House in what will be her most-intimate performance yet. ""It's scary,"" she says. Scary because having her own show at the Opera House has been on her wish list for as long as she can remember. Scary because she's desperate to give the audience the show they deserve. ""It's a lot of money to go out, if you've got kids and you've got to pay for parking and buy a cocktail, that's putting people out. ""I want it to be worth it."" She's unlikely to disappoint. From the moment Coustas broke the news to her parents that it wasn't law school but drama classes that called her, she's been knocking on doors and demanding attention. For so many Australians in the late '80s and early '90s, Effie wasn't just a character but part of the language. The name was interchangeable with being strong and sassy, of taking the barbs of racial slurs and owning the term 'wog' with pride, of refusing to be shamed for being a working-class woman. She doesn't see why not, but she's wary of conversations that question who can play what characters on screen and on stage. ""As an actor, I played animals and men and children and all sorts of stuff, that's why you go to drama school to learn how to play characters and beings outside of yourself. ""I get it, on one level, but I was a fan and I am still a fan of Con the Fruiterer and he's not Greek. ""Mark Mitchell — the actor who played Con the Fruiterer — was a genius, he's a comedian, he's playing characters he fell in love with in his suburb. ""At what point do we stop acting and how narrow does that expression get and are we then just essentially scripted reality stars?"" Coustas says she prefers to deal with the transparency of intention and believes intentions with the characters from shows like Acropolis Now and Wogs out of Work have always been genuine and positive. She'll be drawing from those life stories for her Opera House show. And she can't wait to be back on stage after a brutal two years of COVID-19 lockdowns. It's a celebration to be in front of an audience after so many long periods without it. ""You don't grow unless you stretch."" She realised that minutes into another performance a decade earlier that almost became her last. It was 2012 and she was still raw from the loss of her daughter, Stevie. She agreed to do a show for three nights but, for a month beforehand, had struggled to remember any of the words. On the night, she started to panic and, as the minutes ticked down, she realised, weirdly, that she hated the idea of anyone laughing at her. She decided she would fake a sudden illness and collapse on stage, forcing a cancellation. But, as she began to perform, she felt the wave of warmth and the laughter, instead of frightening her, enveloped her. The audience never knew they almost missed their date with Effie. She's confident that won't happen again. It was a turning point for her. And the show, This is Personal, is another turning point, when Coustas will reveal her own stories of her migrant upbringing, her life's experiences, the questions from her daughter that she's been able to answer and the ones she can't. And she'll deliver it with her trademark humour to an audience she hopes will recognise themselves in her.

111,NSW Now: Chemical spill causes traffic delays,arts-culture,"  Sydney news: A chemical spill causes traffic delays in Parramatta; Eastlakes man critical after hit and run Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Here's what you need to know this morning. A major chemical spill is causing significant traffic delays on James Ruse Drive, near Parramatta, in Sydney's west. Fire and Rescue New South Wales said it appears a substance spilled after falling off a truck, generating strong vapour and corroding the road's surface. Northbound lanes of James Ruse Drive, near the M4 overpass, are affected. The incident is causing major traffic delays and the clean-up is expected to take some time. Superintendent Adam Dewberry from Fire and Rescue NSW said the impact on traffic would be severe. All lanes on the road are closed and diversions onto the M4 are in place. The finalists in ""Australia's favourite art award"", the Archibald Prize, will be announced at 11am today. Awarded to the best portrait painting, it's a who's who of Australian culture, from politicians to celebrities, sporting heroes to artists. The packing room prize will also be announced. Melbourne artist Peter Wegner won last year's Archibald Prize for his portrait of fellow artist and previous Archibald winner Guy Warren. Last year's Archibald Prize was the 100th anniversary of the portrait award and, for the first time in its history, saw more women than men as finalists. The New South Wales government will today receive a much-anticipated report outlining the state of healthcare in remote, rural and regional communities and what needs to be done to fix that. An upper house committee has finished 18 months of its inquiry and is tabling its report at state parliament at 10am. Committee member and Greens MP Cate Faehrmann has previously promised the committee will be preparing ""bloody solid recommendations"" for the government, including the newly appointed Regional Health Minister. The inquiry has heard NSW Health has been surprised that its efforts to improve medical care for the bush are not working. A former SAS patrol commander codenamed Person 29 will continue giving evidence in the defamation case of war veteran Ben Roberts-Smith today. The Victoria Cross recipient claims several stories published in The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Canberra Times newspapers in 2018 contained false allegations of unlawful killings, bullying and domestic violence. Person 29 has become the third witness called by Mr Roberts-Smith's legal team to back up evidence there were no Taliban insurgents found in a secret tunnel at a compound raided in 2009, where publisher Nine alleges two unarmed prisoners were executed. An elderly man has been left lying on the road with critical injuries, after what police suspect was a hit and run incident in the Sydney suburb of Eastlakes. The 74-year-old man was found on Wednesday morning on the roadway at an intersection and is now fighting for life in hospital. Officers said that, after initial inquiries, they believe he was struck by a car. They've appealed for anyone who has information or witnessed the incident, or who has dash cam footage, to come forward. Partly cloudy. Chance of showers.

112,It paved the way for Bluey — but most likely would not be made today,arts-culture,"  Li'l Elvis Jones and the Truckstoppers, pioneering Australian animation series, turns 25 Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Decades before Bluey, an ambitious cartoon series featured Australian accents and humour, with an Aboriginal character front and centre — but Li'l Elvis and the Truckstoppers almost didn't get made. The 1997 show, about the adventures of three kids in the Australian outback, was a bold undertaking — a totally original story concept, not a remake or an adaption of an existing literary classic. While that seems rare today, consider this bizarre notion — it was decided to produced the series locally with people trained up from scratch, rather than having the animation done cheaply offshore. One of the newcomers who landed a job on the series included three-time winner of the Gold Logie for Australia's Most Popular Television Personality — Rove McManus — who described his role on the production as constituting his ""first 9 to 5 job"", years before he would become a national celebrity. Born of the Keating Labor government's Distinctly Australian Program funding commitment to support ""Australia's cultural industries"", the series was commissioned by then Australian Children's Television Foundation (ACTF) boss Patricia Edgar on a mission to ""find a marketable idea"". ""We advertised widely through film organisations and in the trade press and received twenty-six applications — most of which were derivative, ordinary,"" Edgar wrote in her 2006 memoir. The idea which stood out most was from Peter Viska, a Melbourne animator whose previous work included such titles as Far Out Brussel Sprout, Let 'er Rip Potato Chip and You Beaut Juicy Fruit! ""He had developed an appealing character called L'il Elvis,"" Edgar recalled. ""I was an Elvis Presley fan and [ACTF producer] Susie Campbell thought I might be susceptible to the idea. But Peter's ideas were not viable. ""[Viska] thought we could acquire the rights to Elvis Presley's songs and animate each episode of the series around a song. I explained that the Graceland Estate would be unlikely to respond to an offer,"" Edgar said. Viska tried his luck anyway. ""I wrote to Graceland and asked permission ... they wrote back and said 'no, you can't',"" he said, laughing at the memory. Campbell, with Viska's idea in her pocket, found herself in France at the Annecy festival, an international animation film market event. ""I got stuck in an elevator with the then-president of Universal Animation … bonded in adversity and with time to kill, we chatted. I took my chances at the dreaded 'elevator pitch' and said two words; Li'l Elvis. BOOM!"" Campbell, in a matter of minutes, had managed to sell the Li'l Elvis idea to Universal, the American giant of film and television. They would later pull out due to the Graceland legal difficulties — but, Campbell and Edgar could see they were on to a good thing. What would eventually emerge, with the help of experienced writers such as Esben Storm (Round The Twist) and Chris Anastassiades (Lift Off), was the story — across 26 half-hour episodes — about a young Elvis impersonator with ""a gift for music, a talent for trouble and a desire for only two things; to find out who he really is and be a normal kid again"". Li'l Elvis ""spends his days entertaining truck drivers at his parents' roadhouse by playing Elvis Presley songs, but he is sick of the music and of his mum's insistence that he is 'the King' reborn"" — Viska's nod to Michael Jackson ""having his childhood stolen from him, being forced to get into a family band to make money"". It was a great idea — the trouble was that no-one had a clue as to how to make a cartoon series on such a scale in Australia, with Edgar confessing ""animation was a production process I knew nothing about"". ""It would be a learning experience for me and the whole team,"" she wrote. They had a budget of $11.5 million with which to do it. With French and German production partners coming on board, there was more industry experience to draw on. But it also came with more problems. ""Our writers did not understand the process and everything needed to be rewritten,"" Edgar explained. ""We also had to negotiate cultural differences as some ideas that we found funny were offensive to the Europeans."" ""I had never written animation before and was fairly new to writing children's television,"" Chris Anastassiades said. ""My background was in situation comedy and a disastrous go at sketch comedy."" Anastassiades said Viska was ""really clear"" regarding his vision. ""It had to be funny, not just to kids but to a slightly older audience … there had to be much weirdness in each episode. It was a ton of fun."" A saving grace was that Viska had found, through the French, a designer and director who would prove instrumental in helping the show achieve its uniquely Australian look — ironically, a Belgian. Animation designer and director Jan Van Rijsselberge ""had learnt his English from (1980s Australian television series) Sons and Daughters, watching it in Belgium in English,"" Viska said. The series was ""my first big break,"" Rijsselberge said. ""My role consisted in modernising the look whilst keeping the Aussie feel of the world."" Van Risselberge also remembered the foreign partners' bewilderment over the stories. ""The scripts were written for an Anglo Saxon audience — a mix of adventure, sitcom and slapstick — a style which was hard to comprehend for the French producers,"" he said. As for the characters, the ACTF was ""really aware of the social responsibility of casting Aboriginal people as Aboriginal voices,"" Viska said, with the Aboriginal character of Lionel Dexter played by Indigenous actor Kylie Belling. ""Kylie was really important, she was fabulous,"" he said. Other voices included David Cotter (Len Jones), Bill Ten Eyck (WC Moore), Michael Veitch (Duncan), Marg Downey (Janet Rig), Stig Wemyss (Li'l Elvis speaking voice), Nick Giannopoulos (Hector) and the late comedian Lynda Gibson (Grace Jones). Rock performer Wendy Stapleton was picked to play Li'l Elvis, as well as provide vocals on the show's many musical numbers — until the producers had a change of mind. ""I landed a role as someone doing lots of bit parts, additional characters,"" Wemyss recalled. ""At the end of the first read-through the producers and director pressed the button in the booth and asked, 'Stig, would you mind sticking around'?"" Stapleton would remain as the singing Li'l Elvis, with Wemyss handling the spoken parts — with much effort going into matching the pair's voices in transitional scenes which switched from speaking into song. Voice cast recording sessions were deliberately done with the actors all in the same room, Viska said — ""all trying to outdo each other … ego versus ego"", getting just the result the producers wanted. ""There was no 'too big',"" Wemyss said of the group recordings. ""It was awesome fun. We all felt we were doing something special."" US actor Bill Ten Eyck, who had already played an American ""looking to buy Ramsay Street"" on Neighbours, took his inspiration for billionaire WC Moore's broad Australian accent from comedian Max Gillies — with a dash of Lionel Barrymore's character from It's A Wonderful Life. The Li'l Elvis cast were ""some of the funniest people I've ever had the pleasure to work with,"" he said. Ten Eyck would go on to supply 15 voices across the series. A crucial part of the show was the music, which Peter Viska imagined as ""rockabilly, but with a didgeridoo"". Tony Naylor, a veteran session guitarist whose work included ""both Crocodile Dundees and the Alvin Purple films"" got the gig of bringing the sound of ""didgerbilly"" to life. ""I was intrigued … but at first wasn't sure how it would work musically, combining the rockabilly chordal changes with didj drones,"" Naylor said. The late Aboriginal actor and musician Tom E Lewis provided the soundtrack's didgeridoo. ""We wrote the tracks with didj samples as a guide … then [Lewis] took it to a whole other level of expression."" The sound recordings in the bag, at least that part was done. The real trick would be bringing Li'l Elvis alive on the screen — with a team mostly made up of people who had never worked in animation before. 2D animation, the kind involving hundreds of painstakingly hand-drawn images that make up sequences, is typically one of the most expensive forms of screen entertainment. In 1996, most cartoon series were still 2D. Computer generated imagery (CGI) 3D animation on an episodic television series level was still far off — and the computerisation of in-betweening was also in its early stages. 2D animation, as popularised by Disney, Warner Brothers and Hanna Barbera, was still king — and due to the amount of human labour, cost a fortune to produce, which made the decision to employ a team of largely inexperienced people to produce Li'l Elvis — the equivalent of around 11 hours, or over seven feature-length films, of animation — even more remarkable. The production workforce simply did not exist at the time in Australia. In keeping with their act of faith, the producers set up in a disused convent in Albert Park, Melbourne. There, Viska and the producers would rely on some older pros, to guide the newbies. ""The ACTF decided to build a studio from scratch for L'il Elvis, meaning a very steep learning curve for a very young and inexperienced team,"" Van Rijsselberge said. Robbert Smit, whose work had included Blinky Bill, Footrot Flats and The Magic Pudding, was put in charge of the animation and told to pick around 90 artists from the ""500 portfolios dropped on my desk"". ""We were three months behind schedule and had to sink or swim. But swim we did,"" Smit said. Andi Spark was Smit's assistant director and recalled the determination to ""make this on site, in Australia, training up people for the industry"". Joining the 90 new artists would be a handful of seasoned key frame animators, along with 39 trainees and in-betweeners — artists who complete the ""in between"" drawings, using the key frame illustrations as a guide. Having over 100 artists all draw a character the same way, consistently and without variation, proved difficult, Spark recalled — with the term given to describe characters which have gone wrong somehow as being ""off model"". ""Having a neurotically keen eye for detail was essential to spot things like missing buttons, back-to-front stripes, off-model noses, et al,"" she said. For the series' background art, it would be another foreign eye which would help capture the look the producers wanted. ""I came from the Czech Republic,"" said veteran artist and illustrator Richard Zaloudek, who like Smit had worked on Footrot Flats. ""The European landscape is like a postcard, but you come here [to Australia] and the light is so different, the vastness, the red soil,"" he said. Despite the ""crazy workload … hoping I didn't get sick, I had no assistant"" Zaloudek describes his Li'l Elvis experience as ""a wonderful time"", saying of Viska ""considering he never worked with me before, he trusted me completely"". One of those who joined the Li'l Elvis team was Rove McManus, who had come to Melbourne from Perth to pursue a career as a comedy performer. ""I saw an ad in the Melbourne street press, they were looking for animators,"" McManus said. ""I gave them a call and asked if there was a chance I could do a voice role, but they had long before been cast and recorded."" Still, he persisted, convincing the producers he would be an asset in whatever role they could give him. ""I really cared, I was really invested in the show, I was passionate about animation and wanted the series to succeed,"" he said. McManus said at the time the Li'l Elvis production was beginning ""I had only been in Melbourne a year or so"". ""I had not had a regular day job, I had only been a performer, that's when I learnt what coffee was, working during the day [on Li'l Elvis] and performing at night."" For much of the series, McManus was working with painted backgrounds and animation cels, using a flatbed scanner to import thousands of images into what was at the time a state-of-the-art computer system. ""I'd sit there for ages trying to get the colour balance right,"" he remembered. ""It wasn't great technology."" By the late 1990s, image-scanning technology had improved, but still struggled to capture the beautifully painted scenes, with their wide range of reds, oranges, yellows and violet hues. ""One day, when I didn't do a good job of it, Peter Viska came in and got very mad at me, holding up the original background against the screen,"" McManus said. After that dressing down, ""I worked hard and got it right"", he said — figuring out through trial and error what worked and what didn't, keeping a notebook of scanning settings to achieve the desired result. It worked — and perhaps impressed the producers just enough to allow him to voice a character in the Monkey Sea, Monkey Doo episode. McManus would go on to become a successful comedian, television and radio presenter and producer, winning three Gold Logies — the award for the most popular personality on Australian television, as voted by the public. Producer Susie Campbell said by the end of season two, ""we all just needed a rest"". ""Li'l Elvis was an animated drama series. It was not developed as an ongoing cartoon, but as a full drama with a story arc over the 26 episodes that had a start, a middle and an end. Ongoing cartoon series, as opposed to animated dramas, were not eligible for Australian funding at the time. ""The ACTF did not see it's role as continuing in animation production, more so as forging a market for it and then stepping back."" For those who learnt their craft on the show, the experience of working on Li'l Elvis still holds fond memories. Mark Sheard, the youngest trainee in the Li'l Elvis team, still works in animation. ""It's still the best production and community I have ever worked with. I guess that's why I'm still here, chasing that dream to work with so many amazing people again,"" he said. Ariel Waymouth, who started at Li'l Elvis as an animation checker, stayed in the industry and is now with VicScreen as a production executive focused on children's content. ""I also had to count the frames for each scene daily and calculate each animators' quota,"" she said. ""I heard every excuse there was to why a scene wasn't finished … and yes the dog did eat a folder once."" Current chief executive of the ACTF, Jenny Buckland, said Li'l Elvis was a game changer. ""It was popular at the time and demonstrated that Australian landscapes and accents in animation would appeal to Australian kids, but I think we are only just beginning to realise the impact of this. ""We're finding that many of the people working here in animation today … were inspired by Li'l Elvis growing up. They seemed to absorb that it had been made here, that it was somehow different to a lot of the other animation they were watching, and this has inspired a sense of believing they might follow a creative path."" Andi Spark, who would later help set up the studio which would produce international smash hit Bluey, said the blue dog owed Li'l Elvis a debt. ""Bluey's certainly been one of the most successful shows ever to come out of Australia, but I reckon Li'l Elvis really laid the foundation for that in being the first wholly original written for TV animated series from a distinctively Australian perspective."" Bill Ten Eyck said a show like Li'l Elvis would simply not get made today and is scathing of the current level of support for the Australian arts, saying ""consecutive governments"" have ""waged an ideological jihad"" on the sector. ""The short-sightedness regarding the destruction of the local arts industry is the saddest thing I've seen in 30 years,"" he said. ""These days I am a teacher [of drama] … how do I tell kids they should go into the arts?"" For fans of the show keen for an encore from Li'l Elvis, Janet and Lionel, there is a glimmer of hope. The ABC can reveal work is underway on a stage show musical, which producer Tim Loydell says is ""re-imagining the classic television program for a whole new generation of Australian audiences"". Loydell said the series was ""tipped to take to the stage in 2023"".

113,Aboriginal filmmaker flips script on well-worn Australian myths in her take on Henry Lawson story,arts-culture,"  The Drover's Wife the Legend of Molly Johnson review: Henry Lawson tale turns revisionist western in Leah Purcell’s hands Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog ""Snake! Mother, here's a snake!"" Henry Lawson's story of a mother defending the homestead from a reptilian intruder, first published in 1892, is a classic of Australian literature, his protagonist still an icon of rugged resilience in the face of the outback's many dangers. It is precisely its centrality to the national mythos that makes The Drover's Wife ripe for a postcolonial renovation: this is the premise of Leah Purcell's feature film adaptation, which is patterned in the mould of the revisionist western, drawing on the likes of HBO's Deadwood and Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, with an added wallop of mystery. The film arrives in theatres as the latest manifestation of Purcell's ongoing engagement with Lawson's short story, which began with her highly decorated stage adaptation of 2016, followed in 2019 by a novel. (The film too was completed in 2019, but held for release due to COVID.) Your grandpa's bush tale, this is not. And so you would expect coming from Purcell, a Goa-Gunggari-Wakka Wakka Murri woman whose semi-autobiographical first play, Box the Pony, which debuted in 1997, tackled a youth spent on an Aboriginal mission in Queensland beset by poverty, violence, and racism. In The Drover's Wife the Legend of Molly Johnson – the titular figure having been bequeathed the name by Purcell, who inhabits the role with twinkle-eyed ferocity – there is no snake lurking in the woodpile. Rather than slithering silently along the ground, the threats that present themselves to the pregnant Molly and her four children tend to walk on two legs. If Lawson gestured towards the dangers of being a frontierswoman absent a husband, then Purcell makes them explicit (and brutally so, in a couple of scenes). Molly's unease around the men who happen upon her humble shack – from Nate Klintoff (Sam Reid), the new sergeant in town, accompanied from England by his plummy wife Louisa (Jessica De Gouw), to a powerfully grimy pair of her husband's mates (Anthony Cogin and Harry Greenwood); all characters of the writer-director's invention – is intimated to have stemmed from traumatic experience. You get the sense that her husband's absence is maybe not such a problem, after all. Certainly, the way that Molly reaches for the knife in her boot on hearing an errant sound, with Mark Wareham's expressive camera circling her like a phantom predator, suggests that it's an act of muscle memory. One visitor is able to earn her trust, however: Yadaka (Rob Collins), an Aboriginal man on the run from the law. He is in effect Purcell's retort to the ""stray blackfellow"" of Lawson's short story, who is mentioned in passing as having cheated the drover's wife – the architect of the hollow woodheap that becomes a hiding spot for the deadly snake. Though Molly is initially wary of the fugitive – ""Cross me and I'll kill you,"" she warns before helping him free of his shackles – she softens at the sight of his skill with her eldest, Danny (Malachi Dower-Roberts), a plucky kid still growing into the many responsibilities he already shoulders. Despite the murder charges that hang over him, Yadaka is only an unlikely ally for Molly if you're completely oblivious to the film's politics – which would be difficult, given how frequently they rise to the surface in the form of markedly on-the-nose dialogue. ""My crime, Missus?"" Yadaka responds to his host's questioning. ""Existing while Black."" The ennobling of this character is one of the more pointed revisions Purcell makes to Lawson's story, bringing the ugly racial politics on which colonial Australia was founded to the fore, alongside those of gender. (Though it is not her most drastic revision to this end – the twist that arrives midway through the piece reveals the way in which the story has been constructed to privilege an Indigenous perspective.) The film's mission – broadly, to interrogate the legacy of violence that continues to give shape to contemporary society and policy – is a critical one, and is shared by recent Australian films including Jennifer Kent's The Nightingale and even, in a more oblique way, James Vaughan's arresting debut Friends and Strangers. I do wonder, however, if Purcell's message could have been more affecting, and the film more immersive, without such insistent signposting – moments in the film that often seem retrofitted to match up with a contemporary understanding of these hot button issues. The film's climactic expression of its feminist values entails Louisa, the sergeant's wife and a budding journalist, heading up a miniature protest against domestic violence. Dressed in white gowns emblazoned with the words ""HEAR HER"", she and her companions wouldn't look out of place next to Cara Delevingne at the 2021 Met Gala in her all-white ""Peg the Patriarchy"" ensemble. (As it happens, Delevingne had unknowingly co-opted the slogan, which was trademarked by a woman of colour. Thankfully Louisa, at this point in the film, has already learned a lesson about intersectionality.) There is great potency in Purcell's script-flipping set-up; her take on The Drover's Wife, in its multiple incarnations, is a stinging de-mythologisation. She needn't have inscribed the subtext in such bold font. The Drover's Wife the Legend of Molly Johnson is in cinemas now.

114,Facelift spanning 13 years for Brisbane's Story Bridge just got a lot more expensive,arts-culture,"  Brisbane's Story Bridge $80m paint job expands to $128m, 13-year restoration project Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A Brisbane City Council project to repaint the Story Bridge has blown out from its original five-year, $80 million budget into major maintenance works spanning 13 years. The 82-year-old landmark's first complete paint job since the 1930s was announced by former lord mayor Graham Quirk three years ago. After initial difficulties with unexpected costs from potential contractors, the project is well underway with an expanded cost of $128 million up until 2032. Carrying about 100,000 vehicles per day, the Story Bridge is a key link across the Brisbane River between Fortitude Valley and Kangaroo Point and is regularly lit up to highlight social causes. The council's infrastructure chair, Andrew Wines, said the original $80 million budget was for a ""smaller-scale repaint project"", which the council realised was not ambitious enough to ensure the bridge was safe for coming decades. Mr Wines said the project was ""one of the more expensive projects"" the council had tackled in recent years, impacted by increased global costs for construction materials. ""We're bringing future costs forward to try and reduce future expenses for maintenance … to make sure this 82-year-old bridge, this iconic structure that sits in the heart of our city, lasts."" The project now includes repairs and strengthening, re-coating of the steel beams, footpath upgrades and a specialist containment system to protect the public from the bridge's old lead paint. Last year the council announced the installation of scaffolding and three customised, moveable maintenance platforms that will permanently hang under the bridge for future maintenance projects. A specialised lead paint removal team also needs an airlock cleaning station, specialised scaffolding to hold that station, and a fully air-conditioned capsule to keep the hazardous materials contained. ""This is a major project in all reality … in many ways it's a major maintenance works package, and we've actually begun a lot of the work in the side of the bridge itself,"" Mr Wines said. ""You can stand in these spaces and touch the under-portion of the bridge where the cars drive over, and each and every one of these surfaces has been stripped back and repainted with a water-resistant paint surface to make sure this metal structure lasts."" Workers will gradually move up the entire structure over the years, Mr Wines said, where some traffic impacts would be felt. Since the 2018-19 financial year, the council has spent $17.1 million on the restoration project, while anticipated future costs between 2022-23 and 2030-31 total $132.2 million. Opposition leader Jared Cassidy said the ""eye-watering"" cost was for a ""poorly managed, inner-city, black hole project from the LNP"". ""The LNP has been in charge of this council for nearly two decades and has failed to maintain our city’s assets,"" Mr Cassidy said. ""And that neglect is now costing residents hundreds of millions of dollars in extensive repair works."" The Story Bridge took five years to build, opening in 1940, after being commissioned as a work-generating project during the Great Depression. The bridge will be repainted in its traditional grey – a colour freely available in the 1930s, Mr Wines said.

115,"Guy Sebastian's star power 'seduced' police in $1m fraud probe, court hears",arts-culture,"  Guy Sebastian's star power 'seduced' police in $1m fraud probe, court hears Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Police may have been ""seduced"" by Guy Sebastian's high profile as they investigated his former manager, who is accused of embezzling $1 million of the singer's money, a court has heard. Titus Emmanuel Day is standing trial in the District Court accused of defrauding the pop star, who he managed for a decade. In his opening address, Dominic Toomey SC told the court ""there is an answer to every one"" of the more than 60 charges Mr Day is facing. ""You may wonder whether the authorities or even police were wilfully blind … seduced by Mr Sebastian's high profile,"" Mr Toomey told the jury. During his first day on the stand on Wednesday morning, Sebastian said he was introduced to Mr Day in 2007. Sebastian signed a management contract with 22 Management, where Mr Day was employed, the court heard. In 2009, Mr Day poached Sebastian for his own breakaway management company called 6 Degrees. Sebastian said Mr Day described him as his ""marquee client"" during attempts to woo him. The Australian Idol winner said he was ""very proud"" of what he'd achieved in his career at that point. Sebastian told the jury Mr Day took over control of almost every aspect of his professional affairs, including the execution of contracts. ""Was it that case that you read through every document that was presented for you to sign,"" Crown prosecutor David Morters SC asked. ""No,"" Sebastian replied. ""One of the benefits of my manager was he was a contract lawyer so I trusted ... he wouldn't do so unless it was ready to be signed."" The court heard a draft contract was drawn up when Sebastian switched to 6 Degrees, but according to Mr Morters, it was never formally executed or signed. ""That draft contract does not reflect the agreement that the parties reached when Sebastian commenced with 6 Degrees,"" Mr Morters said. Mr Morters said 6 Degrees and Mr Day then took control of Sebastian's professional affairs, including performance rates, royalties and payments for ambassadorships. The relationship continued until November 2017, when it ended in ""hostile"" fashion. Mr Morters told the jury Sebastian then discovered ""anomalies"" in bank accounts. ""The Crown says payments were received by 6 Degrees on behalf of Sebastian for royalty payments that had never been remitted,"" Mr Morters said. ""He [Mr Day] was the person solely responsible for the management of funds."" Sebastian filed a civil claim in July 2018, which Titus Day disputes and has made cross-claims over. The trial continues. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

116,Private landowners yet to approve Parnkalla Trail upgrade along Port Lincoln foreshore,arts-culture,"  Parnkalla Trail upgrades hope to link Axel Stenross Museum in safer Port Lincoln foreshore walk Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Negotiations are ongoing between private landowners and the Port Lincoln City Council over proposed upgrades to the popular Parnkalla Trail. If approved by property owners the foreshore walk from the Lincoln Hotel will be extended through to the Limani Hotel. Council CEO Matthew Morgan said discussions with home owners have been ongoing since 2016. ""We're dealing with various different landowners including private landowners and government landowners,"" he said. ""We [already] have full government permission to utilise the coastal path from the Limani to Axel Stenross. ""[But with] the Limani through to the foreshore there are various different private landowners. If they agree we will go coastal; if they don't agree then we will go roadside."" This week the incumbent Member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, announced $6.8 million to upgrade parts of the Parnkalla Trail if he is re-elected this month. The upgrade is phase 3 of City of Port Lincoln's Foreshore Redevelopment Project. The council has already begun works along the foreshore earlier this year as part of phase 2 of the project. Mr Ramsey said the trail was an important part of the city's attraction and said that both locals and tourists would enjoy the upgrades. ""I think we will see a lot more of the locals getting out to exercise in the morning, going for a walk, going for a run, all those things. And it will be great for the Port Lincoln community,"" he said. ""I think it's a really, really important part. The frontage of Port Lincoln is one of the delights of the place, it's a great tourist attraction."" The trail was formally developed in 1986 and follows the coastline around Boston Bay, providing visitors and locals with the opportunity to enjoy the views of the coastline. In 2008, the council developed a Parnkalla Trail Strategy, identifying key aspects of the path that needed upgrading. Mr Morgan said the upgrades were needed urgently between the Limani Hotel and the Axel Stenross Museum close to the highway as it could be dangerous for some walkers. ""There are points where you're dicing with traffic and heavy vehicles and putting your life in your own hands. That won't happen if this project is funded,"" he said. He added the council was looking to start construction on phase 3 of the project within the next year. ""It probably has a 12-month construction period, so [it'll be] about two and a half years until the path is completed,"" he said.

117,The Kid LAROI dominates APRA awards after Bieber collaboration,arts-culture,"  The Kid LAROI wins three awards, including songwriter of the year at APRA Awards, including song of the year for Stay collaboration with Justin Bieber Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Teenage star The Kid LAROI has won three top accolades at the APRA music industry awards night in Melbourne. The 18-year-old multi-talented performer has been named songwriter of the year for 2022, and won the peer-voted song of the year award for STAY, the global hit he co-wrote with Justin Bieber. LAROI also claimed the prize for most performed in the hip hop/rap category, for his song Without You. ""I really appreciate the support and I want to give a quick shout out to fans back home. I'm stoked to be on my way back and I can't wait to perform the End of the World tour with you guys,"" he said. The proud Kamilaroi artist won't stop reaching milestones, and now he's made Hottest 100 history with his Justin Bieber collab 'Stay'. LAROI is currently on tour with upcoming dates in Mexico before he returns for shows in Australia. Tones And I took home two awards, winning most performed pop work with Fly Away, and most performed Australian work overseas with her global hit Dance Monkey. But on the 40th anniversary of the music awards, the gongs were not just for fresh-faced performers bursting with talent. Angus Young and the late Malcolm Young won most performed rock work for Shot In The Dark, from their seventeenth studio album Power Up. The brothers, along with the late Bon Scott, won a Gold Award at the very first APRA Awards in 1982 for AC/DC's Highway to Hell. The Wiggles also picked up a prize, the Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music.

120,'Draw from these two giants': Ruby Hunter and Archie Roach monuments unveiled in the Riverland,arts-culture,"  Monuments honouring Aunty Ruby Hunter and Uncle Archie Roach inspires next generation Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The family of the late musician Aunty Ruby Hunter say a monument recognising her impact in the Riverland will inspire young Aboriginal people for years to come. Warning: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are advised the following contains the name and images of a person who has died. Aunty Ruby Hunter, a Ngarrindjeri and Erawirung woman, and Uncle Archie Roach, a Gunditjimara and Bundjalung man, were partners in music and life. While living along the Murray River they helped to house dozens of people struggling with homelessness, and inspired their own families through oppression. Now, their significant contributions to the Riverland community have been immortalised on the edge of Barmera's Lake Bonney. Aunty Ruby's nephew James Love, a proud Ngarrindjeri man who works with the Aboriginal Sobriety Group, said the monument paid homage to two leaders who were ""a prime example for coming through brokenness"". ""Let their lives shine the beacon of healing and hope and restoration to anyone out there who's tossing up lost, alone,"" he said. ""Stop and pause and draw from these two giants, these trees of knowledge."" Aunty Ruby and Uncle Archie went on a journey with addiction and recovery — something that inspired Mr Love every day through his own healing process. ""I draw strength from their story,"" he said. Looking to future generations of young Aboriginal people who come to visit the monument, Mr Love hoped they would feel a sense of ""royalty and traditional ownership"". ""I want them to be empowered. I want them to be walking with their heads held high knowing that they are home,"" he said. ""I want them to know they're not alone in the struggle. ""These old ones before us, they beckon us home and they want us to make the right choices so that we too can go home to them."" The two pillars stand strong side by side, adorned with glass mosaic artwork designed by Aunty Ruby's sister-in-law, Aunty Rosslyn Richards. Uncle Archie's totem is the eagle, while Aunty Ruby's Ngarrindjeri Ngaitye is the nori — the majestic pelican frequently spotted in the water and land surrounding Lake Bonney. ""One of Ruby's best sayings was 'the nori has landed',"" Aunty Rosslyn said. ""So anytime she used to travel anywhere, she used to ring up all hours of the night to let us know 'the nori has landed',"" she said. Aunty Ruby's eldest brother, Uncle Wally, said the monument honoured everything the pair achieved. ""Being homeless, being taken away … then they became singer-songwriters recognised right around the world,"" he said. Brother Jeff also spoke about the importance of Aunty Ruby's music as a universal language. ""People can relate regardless of who they are,"" he said. ""All cultures here have music. It does wonders for you."" ABC Riverland will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday. Sign up to stay connected.

121,"In an act of love, Cyndy gave away her son. A lullaby helped her grieve and heal",arts-culture,"  Noongar elders and artists in Northam keep local language alive through song Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Family comes first for Whadjuk Ballardong woman Cyndy Moody. In an act of love in 2017, the award-winning musician gave away her four-month-old son, Jeremiah, to her older sister who was unable to have children. ""I want to have him close to me as he gets older, telling him stories and passing on that knowledge that he was special,"" she said. As the mother-of-three grieved her loss, Cyndy decided to write a lullaby in Noongar — Ngany Koorlangka, or My Kid — about mothers everywhere who miss their children. Cyndy still sees Jeremiah regularly, and often sings the song to him as he falls asleep. The piece won the 2021 Country Song of the Year at the West Australian Music Awards, and is now being used to teach others about the language through the Noongar Lullabies program. The initiative was launched by the Community Arts Network in 2017, working with Noongar artists, elders, and their families to help revive the ancient language. Students begin by learning vowels and pronunciation, before reciting chants and performing singalongs in Noongar. Then, it's over to them to write and record their own lullabies. Noongar musician Phil Bartlett, who runs the program with Cyndy and wrote the music for Ngany Koorlangka, says his focus is ensuring students are having fun while they learn. ""Before they know it they're picking up words and phrases, and the learning process just happens in their own time,"" he said. ""You've got a small part in just spreading fun and love — and that's what I love most. It's a great feeling."" Classes have so far been held in Bunbury, Collie, Midvale and Mandurah — with Northam the latest town to host the program. Northam elder Donna Moody sits on the advisory committee at Bilya Koort Boodja, which is the town's Nyoongar culture and environmental knowledge centre. She says it's important to pass on knowledge to the next generation to help keep languages alive. ""Growing up in Northam and having family connection here — my grandma is one of the oldest elders — for years we spoke Noongar, or Balladong, as a main language … [Nan] kept a lot of the language and was able to pass it down to us,"" she said. ""I think it's great for our community, and I'd like to see more community people come along because we've got a lot of talent in this town. I think it's brilliant."" Lullaby sessions will be held once a week at Bilya Koort Boodja in Northam until the end of June, with all Noongar community members welcome to attend. Almost half of the world's 6,511 languages are now endangered. Cyndy says she can't wait to unlock the local potential. ""I'm from Northam and there's a lot of potential, a lot of talent here. So it's wonderful that it's in my home town,"" she said. ""Noongar language is lost, and now it's getting re-learnt and recovered. When something's gone it's lost forever, so this is a great opportunity."" ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday.

British sailor James Morrill and some of his colleagues were saved by Birri Gubba people after they were shipwrecked off the north coast of Queensland. Morrill became a part of their tribe, lived with them for 17 years, and eventually became one of the early white pioneers for Aboriginal land rights. ""Not only was it a story that I had no idea about, but I was astonished that something like this happened in Australia,"" Colquhoun said. ""It's the Aussie Pocahontas, in a way."" It was not until Morrill witnessed massacres of Indigenous people by white settlers that he decided his best chance to defend Aboriginal land was to rejoin white society and fight for land rights using the law. The film, called The Wild One, was brought to life with the help of Birri Gubba elders in northern Queensland and a cast of actors led by Matt Oxley, who played Morrill, and John Jarratt. Indigenous actress Marlena Law plays the role of Teeburra, who became Morrill's wife. She said the story was an uplifting example of harmony between colonial and Aboriginal people. ""Seeing this type of story where the European is initiated into the tribe and into the group, it's a way to show how we can be together and can be connected as one,"" Law said. Colquhoun said Birri Gubba elders wanted the story told for the same reason. ""An elder said to me he wanted this to show white and black society coming together and I think that's the story of James Morrill,"" Colquhoun said. ""He was a white British man coming into this strange culture, but taking it as his own and falling in love with it."" Part of the writing process for the film included having some of the dialogue translated into the Birri Gubba language. Law said she enjoyed the challenge of speaking it. ""I prepared by listening to Birri Gubba people speak and how they pronounce words,"" she said. ""When you read them, it's not always how they're pronounced, so it's a good thing they had Birri Gubba people saying the lines as well."" Luckily for Colquhoun, Morrill had been interviewed for an article about his life, before he died in 1865. The article provided invaluable insight into his experience living with the tribe and helped shape the script of The Wild One. ""We had this article of 20 pages of James describing his journey, but we also needed to figure out any biases or what might've not been said, or to try and read into what James meant when he said certain things,"" Colquhoun said. Colquhoun originally intended to shoot the film in north Queensland, where his lead character lived part of his life. But travel restrictions at the time of filming meant he instead chose the Southern Highlands of NSW. ""We shot the first part in Kangaroo Valley at a museum set up as a little village,"" he said. ""We shot the internal scenes in one of their settler huts, then we met a lovely family who were the animal wranglers for some of the horses we had on the film."" The family allowed the crew to shoot some scenes on their property at Canyonleigh. The film is expected to be released in July or August this year.

123,"Tiny Oz pays tribute to death-defying 1870s trapeze artists and their scantily clad, 'scandal-creating' act",arts-culture,"  Tiny Oz pays tribute to death-defying, scantily clad trapeze artists from 1870s Adelaide Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It is a sunny day in the late 19th century. A crowd in the Adelaide Parklands picnics on cold cuts and pigeon pies as a large balloon slowly rises into the sky. High in the air, a scantily clad woman performs trapeze tricks suspended from the balloon basket — before slipping away to parachute to the ground. This story from Adelaide's past has been brought to life in miniature form by the ABC's Tiny Oz series, which features craftspeople from across Australia re-creating their local history. Tonight's episode features a miniature of the first-ever hot air balloon to lift off in Adelaide — and the carnival atmosphere that surrounded it. Co-host and miniaturist JoAnne Bouzianis-Sellick was amazed at the stories coming out of her home town. ""Ladies, scantily clad, would launch out of the balloon with not much more than a canvas beach umbrella strapped to their back and perform these death-defying aerobatics to the cheering crowds below,"" she said. ""There's no safety wires, there's no safety nets, they're just basically plummeting towards the earth. Comedian Jimmy Rees and tiny craft artist JoAnne Bouzianis-Sellick unite with the extraordinary craftspeople of Australia to re-create remarkable moments from our nation's history, in glorious miniature. ""Brass bands would play to say, 'Here they are — they're not like a pancake on the ground'."" She said the aerial acrobats, Gladys and Valerie Van Tassel, were orphaned at a young age and found refuge in the circus before performing their trapeze act all over the world. Ms Bouzianis-Sellick said they created scandal wherever they flew. ""They caused huge dramas in Queensland where there were massive protests about these scantily clad women causing young men to become enraged with hormones,"" Ms Bouzianis-Sellick said. ""They caused riots."" Tiny Oz turned to the South Australian Railway Modellers Association (SARMA), one of Adelaide's six model railway clubs, to recreate the scene in Adelaide's Botanic Gardens. The hobby group is filled with retired electricians, engineers, and train drivers as well as young members learning hands-on skills. Former phone technician Graham Phillips recreated the garden's historic Palm House, which was imported from Germany in 1875 and still stands today. ""I was able to go in and measure everything and get an idea of exactly how it was put together,"" he said. The team of 11 hobbyists each worked on their section of the model at home and then brought it into SARMA headquarters for final assembly. ""Until they were actually in place, we couldn't really get a full grasp of what it was going to look like,"" Mr Phillips said. He said it took some unique crafting materials, including emu feathers and tiny seeds to add the finishing touches to the Palm House grotto — the artificial cave inside the glasshouse. ""What I was originally going to do was use three-corner jacks as the rocks,"" Mr Phillips said. ""But they were too big, so I had a look around and there are rhubarb seeds that are similar in size and shape."" SARMA estimated it took 90 days and 1,704 hours to recreate the moment in time. ""Some of the modelling skills of our members was unbelievable [considering] the degree of detail that they went into,"" Mr Phillips said. Ms Bouzianis-Sellick was amazed at how the modelling team solved problems that arose from working on such a small scale. ""The tents are made from tea bags, an everyday object we all use,"" she said. ""We all look at things for not what they are but what they can become."" The model is on display at the State Library of South Australia in Adelaide until the end of May. The Palm House in Adelaide's Botanic Gardens, the last remaining German-built glasshouse from the late 1800s, is being restored. Librarian Mark Gilbert said finding a photograph in the library archives of the balloon lifting off made all the difference to the model makers. ""We were able to show the photos, not just of the balloon going up, but also what Adelaide looked like in the 1870s through to the 1890s,"" he said. ""They know what the Botanic Gardens looks like now and so they're getting a view of how it looked like then, and it's fascinating to people."" Tiny Oz airs at 8:30pm Tuesday on ABC TV and ABC iview.

124,'Who needs a Marvel superhero when you've got Molly Johnson?': New film The Drover's Wife examines present and historical truths,arts-culture,"  The Drover's Wife: The Legend of Molly Johnson is a compelling story weaving in present and historical truths Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When The Drover's Wife: The Legend of Molly Johnson is released in cinemas across the country this week, it will be another feather in the cap for lead actor, writer, director and co-producer of the film, Leah Purcell, on a journey lasting almost five decades. The Goa, Gunggari, Wakka Wakka Murri woman first reimagined the Henry Lawson short story as the Balnaves Fellowship recipient award-winning play that premiered in the Belvoir St theatre in 2016, and then as a bestselling novel published by Penguin Random House in late 2019. But the journey really began when her mother read Lawson's short story to her as a five-year-old growing up in Murgon in rural Queensland. ""I was starting to use my imagination and I put myself in that story,"" Purcell said. ""I was that little boy who was his mother's protector."" When the film opens in cinemas this Thursday, after a two-year delay to its release due to the pandemic, it will be the self-made all-rounder's debut feature film. The story is centred on the heavily pregnant Molly Johnson (Purcell), whose husband is away droving cattle, leaving her on their remote Snowy Mountains homestead to care for their four children. When she meets Yadaka (Rob Collins), an Aboriginal man on the run from police, both are forced to confront some long-held secrets. ""The essence of the Henry Lawson short story and his underlining themes of racism, the frontier violence and gender violence are there,"" she said. ""I have breathed oxygen into them and placed them at the forefront. ""But there is a difference because I have layered in my personal Indigenous family stories as the foundation, highlighting the real truth of these times."" Purcell also gave the drover's wife a name – Molly Johnson. Something Lawson didn't do. ""I was well aware of the romanticised version that he had of women in general, of that lifestyle on the land, and how the writing of the black man was stereotypical – he was the lazy black man,"" she said. ""Of course, in Henry Lawson's short story, there's the black snake. ""I replaced that with a black man. ""But that black man becomes the hero. ""It's giving respect back to the Aboriginal man."" Purcell began writing The Drover's Wife The Legend of Molly Johnson eight years ago. ""This was 2014 when the Northern Territory intervention was happening, and all across social media, Aboriginal men were being vilified. ""And I just said, well, that's not true,"" she said. ""I grew up with my Aboriginal uncles – they were my father figures. ""I've got nephews who are great fathers and grandfathers – who are there, very present for their families."" Purcell loosely based Yadaka on her great grandfather. ""My great grandfather was considered a great man who put his family first, who worked extremely hard trying to make a home for them."" In order to give depth and a backstory to each character, Purcell conducted extensive research, diving deep into Australian history, while also speaking to elders and property owners in the Snowy Mountains. ""Having the western genre, placing it in 1893 allowed me to be brutally honest. ""People go, oh, but that was then. And I say, no, this is all still very relevant today. ""And that's what the crime is — that we are still treating each other this way, and it's wrong. ""And we have to make that change and turn the mirror back on ourselves and who we are today."" Purcell's husband Bain Stewart is the lead producer on the film and executive producer of Oombarra Productions, run by himself and Purcell. He's a Ngugi-Goenpul-Noonuccal man from North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands in Queensland. ""Leah is so authentic and real and a truth-teller and she just tells it the way it is,"" Stewart said. ""Somebody prominent said that they'll be teaching Leah's version of The Drover's Wife in 20 years, 50 years, 100 years and not so much Lawson's version, because it's closer to the truth and reality. ""People are saying who needs a Marvel superhero when you've got Molly Johnson?"" Purcell said good art is about starting a conversation. She wants her audiences to be intellectually stimulated and on the edge of their seats. ""You're going to be tossed and turned,"" she said. ""You're going to be thrown around, you're going to get an emotional left hook, and then an emotional right uppercut and go 'what just happened?' ""This film will sit with you, and you are going to want to talk about it."" Purcell has been approached to turn The Drover's Wife The Legend of Molly Johnson into an Opera and there's also a Premium Limited TV series to come. ""I want this story to get out there and for Australia to get behind Molly Johnson and support her. ""And let's knock Ned Kelly off his pedestal and put Molly Johnson up there. ""A hero, sorry heroine, for our country."" The Drover's Wife: The Legend of Molly Johnson opens in cinemas Thursday, May 5.

125,"Claims about Prince William's temper, the secrets behind Camilla's popularity: Which of this year's royal reads should you trust?",arts-culture,"  Books about the royal family from Harry and Meghan to Prince William and the Queen are about to hit the shops Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog If book releases are a barometer of public interest, it seems the House of Windsor has never been more fascinating. In 2022, a tsunami of royal reading is hitting the bookstores at an increasingly frenetic rate. These texts range from biographies (mostly unauthorised), to celebratory tributes, scandalous exposes and serious studies. The authors are royal experts or in a couple of cases the royals themselves. But in the increasingly unreliable world of royal reporting where anyone who has watched The Crown thinks they're an expert, which books can be trusted? It's a thorny issue, for while historical texts examining the royal family delve into archival documents, academic studies and carefully sought-out diaries and letters, modern examinations of the House of Windsor tend to rely on a litany of unnamed sources to back up the author's chosen narrative. The new book on Harry and Meghan's split from the royal family is finally out. Here's what it tells us. Such sources can be ""close friends"" of a prince or a duchess, ""former members of the royal household"", ""senior courtiers"", even family once or twice removed. Certainly, if all these folk are to be believed, the leaky ship around the royal family should be a genuine concern for the palace. But then maybe the leaks are actually coming all the way from the top. Let's not forget the revelatory Finding Freedom, the gossipy hit of 2020 supposedly telling the real story of Harry and Meghan, filled with previously unheard behind palace doors tittle tattle, whose authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand swore blind their subjects had not been involved. Only it turns out Meghan had. In the Duchess of Sussex's copyright court case against a British tabloid, an email exchange revealed that Meghan had indeed briefed her then Head of Communications to pass on key commentary and information to the authors for the book. We'll be able to judge how much more of what really happened to Harry and Meghan was accurate from what will undoubtedly be the biggest seller of the year – Prince Harry's own memoir. Due for release on a yet-to-be-confirmed date ""late in 2022"" it is pitched as an ""intimate and heartfelt memoir from one of the most fascinating and influential global figures of our time"". That's quite a claim! Harry has teamed up with ghost writer J R Moehringer, a US journalist of some renown and says, ""I'm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become"". He promises ""a first-hand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful"". We'll see… Here are a few of the other 2022 crop of new releases worth looking at. As a run through of the many trials, tribulations and triumphs of the Queen's reign, this study by veteran journalist and author Hardman packs a punch. Sure, it's largely celebratory, but the sources are strong – including cabinet papers and diaries — and the commentary measured and intelligent. There is considered debunking of some of the more fanciful claims made in The Crown Netflix TV series, notably that it wasn't UK Prime Minister Tony Blair who stage managed The Queen's plan of action following Diana's death, Her Majesty was fully in charge, claims Hardman. Prince William turns 40 in June and increasingly the future of the monarchy is on his shoulders, so this book is certainly timely. Jobson is a long-time royal reporter for London's Evening Standard and a regular TV commentator and royal biographer, and here he delves into the personalities behind the fraternal rift between Princes William and Harry and examines William's relationship with his father. Among his claims are that Charles hates confrontation while William can have a fierce temper. While there's not a lot of new material in this sequel to Brown's The Diana Chronicles, the former editor-in-chief of Tatler, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker and founding editor of The Daily Beast, presents a telling narrative based on two years of research talking to more than 120 sources. Most are unnamed but she does get under the skin of the issues Brits seem to have with Meghan and those Meghan had with the royal household resulting in the Sussex duo fleeing to live in California. Kelly is the Queen's personal dressmaker and as such has spent her 28-year career closer to Her Majesty than most courtiers, forming a special bond. In a new chapter to her chatty, reverential and largely pictorial book, first released at the end of 2019, she talks about life inside the ""Windsor bubble"". Kelly isolated at Windsor Castle with the Queen during the pandemic and was there also for preparations for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Low is the long-time royal correspondent for The Times newspaper and rightly revered for his forensic reporting. Here he looks especially at those ""men in suits"" behind the royal machine. The advisers, spin doctors and PR gurus who have mapped the course of the royal principals with varied degrees of success. This promises to be a fascinating insight into what really does go on behind the scenes – well beyond the tiara tantrums, it will look at the power of the royal court. Camilla's path to become wife of the next king has been extremely rocky and watching it every step of the way has been biographer and journalist Angela Levin. Next stop for the Duchess of Cornwall will be Queen consort. This book charts her journey and unpicks the secret to her new popularity. A potentially fascinating look at the role of the constitutional monarchy, why we still have one and especially how the British Royal Family has managed to weather so many storms.

126,Iconic Kath & Kim house to be demolished,arts-culture,"  House featured in TV show Kath & Kim to be demolished Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The iconic house used in television series Kath & Kim will be demolished this week. Known affectionately in the show as ""Chateau Kath"", the four-bedroom property was said to reside in the fictional suburb of Fountain Lakes. Situated in the Melbourne suburb of Patterson Lakes, the house last sold in 2016 for $1.485 million. The ABC rented the house during the series' run from 2002 to 2007. The house was most recently renovated in 2019, after the owner of the home held an open house to raise money for Carrie's Beanies 4 Brain Cancer. Pete Rowsthorn, who played Brett on the television show, said the house was both memorable and strange. ""It was a weird house, if I bought it I'd probably pull it down too,"" Rowsthorn told ABC Melbourne radio. ""It had really quite small rooms … the squeaky back door, that was all natural sound. There was no foley man putting that on top."" Rowsthorn said the home had played host to a huge number of stars over the course of the series. ""I played cricket in the backyard with Shane Warne, I danced in the garage with Kylie Minogue, I sat and had dinner with Barry Humphries dressed up as a monk,"" he said. But he downplayed any rumours of a reunion for the 20th anniversary of the program. ""Not that I've heard, but I'm always the last to know,"" he said.

127,'Whatever the hell you want': How these daring costumes have helped queer youths from rural SA tell their stories,arts-culture,"  Young queer people in regional SA find their voice through costume program Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Like many young queer people in regional South Australia, Levi Button has sometimes found it hard to express themself to friends and family. But a new program in one Riverland town is helping Levi and other LGBTQIA+ youth find their voice, even if it means they aren't speaking. Riverland Youth Theatre's There I Am program encourages young queer people to create the best version of themselves through imaginative and colourful costumes. Participants have spent the past five days talking with costume designer Kathryn Sproul about a costume which tells their story and helps them become the person they want to be. Levi said creating this costume helped them understand their emotions and how those emotions make them who they are. ""It's a thing that represents how my emotions are really unstable,"" they said. ""My outfit basically revolves around my family and friends saying things to calm me down and the side that I can't control. ""I feel like my outfit kind of says 'hey I'm here, I might not be able to talk, but I am still a person, and I can be present here, even if I don't feel like it that much'. ""Doing this outfit is a way for me to talk without really saying anything."" Riverland Youth Theatre artistic director Fleur Kilpatrick said helping participants realise ideas that had long been inside of their heads was ""really amazing"". ""I wanted people to have things they could take away that were like talismans of the bravest version of [themselves] against the world. ""On about the second day Kathryn said 'I'm the hand, you describe what's in your head' and she drew these costumes for all of them. ""And all of them had these really clear ideas of what they actually wanted and were able to say 'no that's not quite what I want, I want this' and Kathryn was able to bring those to life."" Participant Rowen Hurrell was inspired by one of their favourite book characters, Kaz Brekker from the Six of Crows series. Rowen said their costume helped them feel control in a world where many things are uncertain. ""I then kind of based it on a part of myself that I've suppressed over the years and bringing that into the light. ""It's my need to have control over a lot of things. We're in a world where we can't control much, but when I was younger I always wanted to be in control. ""If it wasn't my way I didn't want it done or I didn't want to do it. With my costume it's about being able to control whatever I want and it can all go perfectly."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Riverland's weekly email newsletter. The program culminated with a photo shoot on the banks of the Murray River, showcasing their costumes in all their glory. ABCQueer's Instagram account is for everyone under the rainbow. Find LGBTQIA+ stories and advice. Ms Kilpatrick said clothing was a key part of queer identity. ""One of the young people said when they transitioned they had to go through and throw out a lot of their wardrobe,"" she said. ""So where some people can move along and not think a lot about their clothing and just go 'I'll throw on this T-shirt and jeans', these young people think every day about how they present themselves, about how safe or confident they feel moving through the Riverland community. ""Just seeing them being in a space for five days which was totally safe to say 'I want a cloak, and I want flames coming off the cloak' has been special."" Levi said being involved in the program has helped them realise there's a wide network of people that want to support them when they're struggling and that it's fine to do things their way. ""It doesn't have to fit to anyone else's criteria, it can be whatever the hell you want,"" they said. ""As long as it makes you happy, it's all that really matters."" The Riverland Youth Theatre's There I am program was funded through the FRRR ABC Heywire Youth Innovation Grants program.

128,Neighbours confirms return of Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan,arts-culture,"  Neighbours stars Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan to return for series finale Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog One of television's most memorable couples will return to the small screen for one last hurrah, with Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan to star in the finale of the much-loved Australian soap Neighbours. In March, producers of the long-running series announced the show was coming to an end after 37 years. The show's executive producer Jason Herbison announced the return of Minogue and Donovan's characters, Charlene and Scott, in a message on Twitter. ""Scott and Charlene are the ultimate Neighbours couple and it would not feel right to end the show without them,"" he wrote. ""We are thrilled that Jason and Kylie have come home to play a very special part in our series finale."" Herbison's post also featured a close-up shot of a cover of a Neighbours script, which Minogue and Donovan also shared on their Instagram accounts. Minogue and Donovan were a favourite with viewers before their departure in the 1980s, and will return to the show before it ceases production in June. The show also helped launch the careers of Guy Pearce, Margot Robbie and Liam Hemsworth. The decision to bring the curtain down on the show came after the producers, Fremantle Media, were unable to secure a replacement broadcaster after Britain's Channel 5 axed the show from its line-up in February. It is understood the British network contributed towards the majority of the show's production costs. Neighbours airs on Network Ten in Australia. A spokesperson from Fremantle Media said the response from fans at the news of the show ending had been immense. ""Everyone at Neighbours has been overwhelmed by the love and support from the audience since the news came out,"" they said. ""The show has brought a sunny slice of Australia into the homes of millions of viewers around the world, launching the careers of dozens of household names along way. ""But as this chapter of Ramsay Street comes to a close, we promise to do everything we can to give the show the send-off it deserves.""

129,'We need to come together': How the arts sector is leading conversations about rebuilding Lismore,arts-culture,"  Arts organisations in the Northern Rivers are taking on a pivotal role in rebuilding a community devastated by floods Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog At the end of March, as floodwaters rose in Lismore for the second time in just four weeks, a portrait of Karla Dickens was delivered to the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney. The painting, titled Moby Dickens, is Dhungutti artist Blak Douglas's entry into the Archibald Prize. It depicts Dickens, a Lismore-based Wiradjuri artist, standing in floodwaters, holding a leaking pail of water in each hand. While Dickens lives 5 kilometres from the CBD, hit hardest by the floods, the constant rain in the region destroyed her studio. ""If [the painting] makes one more person aware of what's happened where I live, I'm really grateful for that,"" Dickens says. The Wilsons River in Lismore peaked at 14.4 metres on February 28 and flooded again in late March. Homes, businesses and arts spaces were inundated, leaving some residents stranded on their roofs. Douglas (born Adam Hill), who had already started his portrait of Dickens – his friend – prior to the floods, realised he needed to change it. ""I was definitely happy that he made that choice,"" Dickens says. ""[I said,] 'As long as you make it grumpy. I want to be grumpy.'"" She says the holes in the bottom of the buckets symbolise the government's inaction on climate change. ""[Climate change] is happening. It's here. We're all living in the middle of it and it's only a matter of time till people are affected just like the people of the Northern Rivers have been."" Speaking to ABC Arts in the month after the floodwaters peaked, artists and arts organisations in the region shared their experiences and posed ideas about how to rebuild – with the arts sector taking on a pivotal role. The estimated cost of the damage to independent artists across the Northern Rivers, as of April 5, is more than $5.1 million – averaging about $20,000 per artist – according to the region's peak arts support body, Arts Northern Rivers. ""People have lost not just their homes, cars, possessions and are homeless, but they have lost their future income, studios, whole collections, equipment, musical instruments — the lot,"" says Jane Fuller, Arts Northern Rivers' executive director. ""It's the most catastrophic thing I've ever experienced."" Lismore Regional Gallery director Ashleigh Ralph does not yet know the extent of the damage to their collection. ""All the artworks were damaged. We may not be able to save them all,"" she says. Among these are the Hannah Cabinet, valued at more than $1.5 million; works by artists Margaret Olley and Max Dupain; and the Afghanistan war rugs collection being toured by ANU's Drill Hall Gallery. ""The conservators are positive about restoring the Hannah Cabinet, though it may take some time,"" Ralph says. Her team worked for 10 days straight cleaning up the gallery, with more than 450 volunteers arriving to help in that first week. ""It was a community effort; people who had never been to the gallery before as well, just showing up knowing that they could lend a hand,"" says Ralph. But flooding in late March has set the clean-up effort back. ""We had it [the building] at the most pristine it could possibly be, and then the floods came through again … We have to clean it again, like the rest of the city."" Lismore's flood levee, built in 2005, overflowed for the first time in March 2017, leading to a so-called ""one-in-100-year flood"". At that time, NORPA (Northern Rivers Performing Arts), based at the Lismore City Hall, was inundated with 2m of water, silt and sewerage. Their studio, green room, furniture, and much of their archives were wiped out. This year, the impact on the venue was much worse, amounting to around $500,000 of damage, according to Julian Louis, NORPA's artistic director and CEO. Their NORPA Flood Relief fundraising campaign has raised more than $36,000 so far. After 2017, organisations like Lismore Regional Gallery and NORPA created flood plans – which they enacted in February as the waters rose, moving much of their collections and equipment upstairs. These measures proved to be insufficient – but were better than local council precautions, which Louis describes as basically non-existent. ""Council put up some signs that showed us how high the flood was in previous years. And that's about it,"" says Louis. ""Local council need to review their own learning and have in place things that can support the community."" The NSW government committed up to $435,000 in flood relief funding to the arts sector in the Northern Rivers in March, with Arts Minister Ben Franklin noting that the region has ""the highest number of creative practitioners per capita"" in the state. As part of this, Create NSW allocated $70,000 to Arts Northern Rivers to deliver micro-grants of up to $1,000 to local artists and groups; and a further $70,000 to Screenworks for micro-grants of up to $5,000 to screen practitioners. It will also provide $50,000 to Lismore Regional Museum to restore its collection. Everyone else is eligible to apply for a $200,000 pool of funding administered by Create NSW, for grants of up to $30,000 for small-to-medium organisations and up to $10,000 for individuals and groups. Funds can be used to replace equipment and art supplies, repair damaged studios and workspaces, restore damaged work, and employ artists and arts workers. A further $40,000 was committed to Arts Northern Rivers for the micro-grant scheme in late April. In addition, in April, the federal and NSW state governments announced $100 million towards repairing and rebuilding community, arts and cultural infrastructure, such as libraries. This is the only targeted support for arts organisations announced by the federal government so far. At the same time, funding for regional arts in the federal budget has more than halved, from $18 million in 2021-22 to $7.5 million in 2022-23. And Lismore Regional Gallery, Arts Northern Rivers, Elevator ARI and NORPA all had their applications for federal RISE funding rejected earlier this year. RISE funding is not emergency funding: instead, it is intended to fund cultural and creative projects, activities and events. ""For not even one of our organisations to get RISE funding is just pretty unfathomable,"" says Lismore Regional Gallery director Ashleigh Ralph. ""It just demonstrates how little is afforded to the regions when it comes to major funding like that."" In the absence of financial support from government – or while they were waiting to see if and when it would eventuate – many Northern Rivers organisations did their own fundraising. Lismore Regional Gallery has so far raised more than $28,000 through a GiveNow campaign, and Arts Northern Rivers has fundraised more than $107,000 to assist artists with immediate flood recovery. That's in addition to the funding from Create NSW, and donations from Koori Mail and Northern Rivers Community Foundation – all of which is marked for affected artists, after the organisation received more than 250 applications for support. The gallery intends to apply for the Create NSW grant for small-to-medium organisations. In the meantime, the funds they've raised so far will go towards supporting artists. ""[We want] to start commissioning artists to make new work. [For now] we're just kind of patiently waiting for funding to roll out for the recovery,"" Ralph says. Artist Karla Dickens stresses that the funding priority now needs to be housing people. Following the February floods, more than 2,600 homes in the Lismore LGA were significantly damaged, and more than 2,000 were deemed uninhabitable, according to Resilience NSW. ""It's really difficult to create art and not have permanent housing … If you haven't got those fundamental issues covered, like a safe roof over your head, art is just a luxury,"" says Dickens. Artists who are now unable to make work – whether because of shortages in supplies, or the loss of their homes and studio spaces – are the same people who are often called upon to donate art as part of crisis fundraising efforts. For example, artists Kate Pittas and Andrea Hamann, who are based outside of the region, organised the Art for Floods fundraiser, with artists from across the country selling their work and donating the proceeds to NORPA, Arts Northern Rivers and GIVIT. The campaign raised more than $217,000, with 425 artists participating and more than 400 artworks sold. Kylie Caldwell is a Bundjalung woman, an artist, and the Indigenous Arts Officer at Arts Northern Rivers. ""Artists are often at the forefront of recovery in disasters using their innovative repertoires to bring people together, activate spaces, and support businesses and their local community,"" she says. ""Governments need to acknowledge and continue investing in the arts as it does with other industries; they need to continue nurturing and protecting artists' multiple roles within our communities."" The floods in late February also dramatically impacted Brisbane's arts companies – many of which are based on the banks of the flood-prone Brisbane River. In 2011, a 4.46m flood wiped out thousands of historical props and costumes at Queensland Theatre (QT). This year, its bar, courtyard, and studio and theatre spaces were damaged. ""It sucks and it smells and it's horrible and the mould is awful,"" QT's artistic director Lee Lewis told ABC Arts at the end of March. ""But we know how to fix the building because we've done it before and we know how to raise money to fix the theatre because we did that before."" QT applied what it had learned from the last major floods, setting up its own flood plan. ""I've been taking a lot of strength from what was learned in 2011,"" says Lewis. ""And I'm also taking strength from the resilience of Queensland as a whole. Floods, fires, COVID, it's a bit biblical at this point, so I'm getting ready for the locusts."" As part of its clean-up efforts this year, the theatre has ripped out its floors and walls and is attempting to rescue electrical wiring. For the rebuild, it plans to use materials – like smart woods and plastic – that can better sustain flood damage, rather than gyprock, timber and laminates. Moving forward, the theatre will be looking at flood mitigation – including possibly instituting a flood line, which would require all electricals be 1m off the ground. Other measures include building a flood wall around the venue or raising the theatre higher up. ""We know that this is going to happen again. What can we do to help protect the theatre even better in the future?"" asks Lewis. The traditional knowledge of the First Nations peoples of the Northern Rivers, the Bundjalung Nation, need to be drawn upon when thinking about how to rebuild Lismore, says Karla Dickens. ""It's really about deep listening and communication, with communities coming together,"" says the artist. ""First Nations people know this country and this land … They know different histories. Not just a couple of generations of history, but they know the history of this land."" Bundjalung artist Kylie Caldwell says that the local Aboriginal community needs to be involved in all aspects of community building, including disaster management. ""Our mob have embedded survival strategies drawing on local knowledge in crisis situations; our abilities to know how things work in the community are valuable in crisis situations for vulnerable communities,"" she says. ""First Nation knowledge is necessary for creating future planning that aids understanding land and rivers systems, guides response, recovery, and restoration of many places, establishes disaster preparedness strategies before our wet seasons and discusses future aspirations for the rebuild."" She points to ongoing environmental issues in Bundjalung Country – including silt-stained waterways, heavily polluted rivers, landslides and habitat destruction. ""Our community continues to change; the population is growing, agriculture is expanding, water availability is still a concern, and we are in a housing crisis. There is a lot to consider, and the weather is changing, becoming more extreme,"" she says. Caldwell is also a member of First Nations contemporary weaving group Casino Wake Up Time, whose work is featured at the 23rd Biennale of Sydney. There's resonance between the work of Casino Wake Up Time at the Biennale – which is this year titled ""rīvus"", meaning ""stream"" in Latin – and the ongoing crisis in the Northern Rivers. ""Many of the artworks [at the Biennale] speak to our current circumstances of displacement and changing weather systems which cause water issues,"" Caldwell says. ""The exhibition gives our freshwater and saltwater a voice, ongoing attention regarding their role and uses in our communities and the challenges faced by the community with changing water systems. It focuses on thinking about our waterways as living, moving beings with rights."" The arts sector intends to be a part of difficult conversations about how the region – and the arts in particular – re-envisions itself after the floods. ""We're not going to let this happen and just go back to business as usual. This is a game changer,"" says NORPA's Julian Louis. The state government has set up the Northern Rivers Reconstruction Corporation (NRRC) to coordinate rebuilding efforts between different government agencies and levels of government. It has also established an independent flood inquiry, focused on its causes, preparation and planning, the immediate response, and recovery efforts. Deputy Premier Paul Toole said it represented a shift in focus ""to how we can make the infrastructure and homes of the region more resilient in the event of future natural disasters"". Arts Northern Rivers is working on a number of creative industries forums in the region – which will hopefully generate ideas for a long-term strategy for the future of Lismore. Executive director Jane Fuller has suggested holding an initial forum while people are still living with the immediate impacts of the floods, followed by another in about five months' time. She has her own ideas about what that future could look like for artists in the Northern Rivers. ""We need the state and federal governments to come in and we need to really look at our planning around our civic buildings, our art spaces. ""Do we do a multipurpose arts destination or space like a MONA [Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart] or like a HOTA [Home of the Arts] on the Gold Coast?"" At the same time, organisations like Lismore Regional Gallery, NORPA and Arts Northern Rivers are considering the potential of mobile gallery, studio and theatre spaces. Lismore Regional Gallery has already applied for funding from both Create NSW and the Australia Council to create temporary exhibition spaces out the front of the gallery – to hold exhibitions, performances, workshops, activities and events. ""It's really important for the community to have that activation and to have that creativity happening down where they would always come for inspiration and to gather,"" says gallery director Ashleigh Ralph. Fuller thinks that shipping containers could work as temporary multi-arts spaces that could be easily moved in the event of a flood. ""We need a place. COVID separated us all and made us all go and sit in our homes away from each other. The flood is the opposite. We need to come together,"" she says. When artist Karla Dickens speaks to ABC Arts in April, she has just finished a painting about the floods. As Lismore continues to rebuild — and artists regain a sense of stability — many more creative responses like this are likely to follow. ""I just know that it's going to be really incredibly healing and incredibly powerful work that comes from the personal experiences everybody's had,"" Dickens says. Fuller wonders if creatives will leave the Northern Rivers now that many studio spaces have been destroyed. ""I suspect we'll see an exodus of quite a lot of our creatives from the region,"" she says. ""How much do you reinvest back into replacement of all your equipment and all your life's artworks and practice, just for it to happen again?"" Born in Sydney, Dickens moved to the Northern Rivers 20 years ago, enticed by the region's affordability. ""I'm a single mother, I'm an artist, I own my own home. I've got two studios and I've got space for people at times like this, and that would never have happened for me in Sydney,"" she says. ""I wouldn't have been able to have the career I have, because I wouldn't have had the time to make art. I would've been chasing money to pay the bills."" She too reckons some people may leave due to the risk of future natural disasters – but not the artists she knows. ""All my friends that have lost their houses are just waiting to find out how to go forward. They don't want to move. They don't want to leave the area."" Dickens is the creative director of contemporary art festival Art Byron, which will be run for the first time at the end of September. ""There's all local artists in that festival, all gathering,"" she says. ""This is still gonna be a very real and emotive experience up here [in September] … This isn't going away in a hurry and there's no bandaids that are gonna be fixing this experience. ""If anybody's out there with any great ideas or money or art supplies or anything where they want to support other artists, the time's now to act."" Tops Arts & Culture headlines.

130,ABC story inspires 'incredible' Archibald portrait of Australia's oldest Indigenous man,arts-culture,"  Artist Leslie Sharpe paints Stephen Stewart, The Oldest Lore-Man, for Archibald Prize 2022 Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog After reading an ABC article on Australia's oldest Indigenous man, artist Leslie Sharpe knew he wanted to meet Ngarla elder Stephen Stewart and paint his portrait for the national portrait competition, the Archibald Prize. He said reading the article about the Karajarri Nyangumarta man helped him ""understand"" a bit about Mr Stewart's life. ""I got out of bed and went to my wife and said, 'I'm going to enter the Archibald, and I'm going to see if I can connect with Mr Stephen Stewart,' and that's how it started,"" Mr Sharpe said. Warning: Readers are advised that this article contains the name of an Indigenous person who has died. Mr Stewart was born on Pardoo Station, in WA's Pilbara region, and nicknamed Number Two from his time running Yandeyarra Station alongside the late Peter Coppin, who was known as Number One. He is a senior lore-man, and while his exact age is unknown, he is thought to be Australia's oldest Indigenous man, having lived for more than a century. ""We have to follow our lore — lore makes you strong and is why I am still alive,"" he told the ABC last year. Like many Indigenous people born in the early 20th century, Mr Stewart has no birth certificate, so the only record of his age is an engraving on a windmill at Wallal Downs Station, around 300 kilometres from Broome that reads: Stephen Stewart, 1918. But Mr Stewart has said he remembered making an engraving as a child when he began droving cattle along the Canning Stock Route to Meekatharra, so it's unclear whether 1918 is his birth year or simply the date of the engraving. ""It was wild country back then … [we were] proper bushmen,"" Mr Stewart said last year. ""There was only one horse in the lead, ridden by a white man, then the rest of us were walking, driving a big mob of cattle from behind … and I got nothing for it."" When the interstate border to Western Australia reopened in early March, Mr Sharpe, who lives in Martinsville in New South Wales, boarded a plane destined for Perth and then another for Port Hedland, where he met Mr Stewart and his family. ""It was incredible ... my late father was born in 1921, and in a weird way, it was like meeting up with my dad. He was just such a warm person,"" Mr Sharpe said. ""We shared a lot of stories ... I'm originally from Africa and grew up on a farm and also knew something about cattle, and so we had lots of little stories on cattle and all that sort of stuff. It was just wonderful."" After two sittings in Port Hedland, the Stewart family took Mr Sharpe out to Yandeyarra — around 140 kilometres south-east of Port Hedland — to show him the community. ""I was shooting landscapes because I wanted to show my family where I was, and one of the shots I got was two little bits of hills into the distance, and I took that, and I painted that into the reflection of the glasses,"" Mr Sharpe said. Once he returned to Martinsville, Mr Sharpe had only around three weeks to build the frame — which was wider than it was tall to accommodate the Akubra brim — and complete the portrait ahead of the submission deadline. ""I loved it so much I was up at 3:00 every morning, because if I didn't do it, I would never have finished,"" Mr Sharpe said. ""It was just wonderful ... you just couldn't get me away from that painting."" The completed painting measured 1.8m by 1.4m and weighed 45 kilograms. It's called The Oldest Lore-Man. Mr Sharpe said painting Mr Stewart's portrait was a highlight of his career. ""It was one of the nicest things I've done in years. I mean, really, I've had a very fortunate life and done a lot of amazing things but this is really up there with the best I've done in my whole career,"" Mr Sharpe said. The 2022 Archibald Prize finalists will be announced on May 5.

133,50 years of Rocket Man: How a song about an astronaut sent Elton John's career to new heights,arts-culture,"  Rocket Man changed Elton John's career almost overnight — 50 years on, it remains an anthem Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When it came time to name the 2019 film about the life of Elton John, there were a few of his songs worthy of being the title — I'm Still Standing, Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me, Sad Songs, Your Song. But really, when it came down to it, it had to be Rocket Man, the closest thing John has to a signature song. Released 50 years ago this month, Rocket Man came at a vital time in John's then-burgeoning career, saving him from being written off as a one-hit wonder. There's also a fitting similarity between the song's main character and the singer — over the years John definitely risked it all and flew too high before ""burning out"", Icarus-like, and crashing back down to Earth. That's the notion that Rocket Man conjures up, even if its actual meaning is somewhat more prosaic. Bernie Taupin began writing lyrics for Elton John in 1967, kicking off one of the most unique and fruitful songwriting collaborations in music history. But by 1972, their partnership had produced only one major hit — the 1970 single Your Song, which went top 10 in the US and the UK, and number 11 in Australia. Follow-up singles Friends, Levon and Tiny Dancer fared less well, with the latter a top 20 hit in only Australia and Canada. In the wake of a hectic 1971 in which John released three albums (the studio effort Madman Across The Water, live recording 17-11-70, and the soundtrack to little-seen film Friends), Taupin and John, along with John's touring band, decamped to Château d'Hérouville near Paris in January 1972 to make what would become the album Honky Chateau. In his autobiography Me, John explained that the genesis of Rocket Man was as regular and everyday as almost every other collaboration he and Taupin had — the same bizarre mix of the mundane and the magical. ""Bernie writes the words, gives them to me, I read them, play a chord, and something else takes over, something comes through my fingers,"" John wrote. ""The muse, God, luck: you can give it a name if you want, but I've no idea what it is. ""I've never sat down with one of Bernie's lyrics and nothing has come out. ""I don't know why. I can't explain it and I don't want to explain it."" At Château d'Hérouville, Taupin would sit at his typewriter in a room by himself, ""bash out his lyrics"", as John put it, ""and leave them for me on the piano"" for John to find in the morning and put to music over breakfast. On the first morning in the chateau, John had turned three sets of Taupin lyrics into songs before the band awoke. Among them was Rocket Man. Taupin's lyrics were inspired by a Ray Bradbury short story titled The Rocket Man, in which an astronaut has to regularly leave his wife and child to make trips into space, with Taupin taking the novel approach of imagining the life of an astronaut as ""just [a] job, five days a week"", as opposed to the heroes of the time. New guitarist Davey Johnstone was sceptical that John and Taupin could work so fast, so John played the three songs for him. Rocket Man immediately jumped out to Johnstone, who asked John to play it again. ""He didn't add a solo or do anything that a regular lead guitar player might do,"" John wrote of that moment. ""He used a slide and played odd, lonely notes that drifted around and away from the melody — it was great."" John told Rolling Stone that Rocket Man felt different to anything he'd done previously. ""It had an acoustic guitar on it … it was a simpler sound,"" John said. ""I was becoming successful, I was so confident, musically."" Keyboardist Richard Tankard, who has played with the likes of Jimmy Barnes, Richard Clapton, Things Of Stone & Wood, and Albert Lee, remembers Rocket Man standing out to him amid the bevy of great tracks on John's first Greatest Hits compilation, which was released in 1974 and part of the record collection in his grandma's house. Tankard was already learning piano when he first heard that album and found myself playing along to it as part of a musical awakening that included watching John's early performances on the ABC's music program Countdown. ""I was trying to listen to what everyone on Countdown was doing, and trying to make sense of it on the piano, so I guess Elton was part of a larger thing,"" Tankard said. ""But on that collection of the Greatest Hits, [Rocket Man] seemed like a really special track — it's definitely got a flavour, it's got an atmosphere that's different."" Tankard said the instrumentation and arrangements help it stand out; nice yet unexpected use of slide guitar, understated spacey drums that don't play for much of the verses, melodic bass-playing, and prominent acoustic guitar. But it also stands out among the pop music of its era. Tankard noted the song uses ""jazz-tinged"" chords in its verse, giving the song a melancholy mood before shifting to the relative major of B flat for ""a more optimistic chorus"". ""That key of B flat, it's not overly common [in pop music] so it gives it a different flavour,"" he said. While that detail might not resonate with most listeners, they definitely pick up on the hypnotic back-and-forth of its two-chord verses and outro. ""It's quite hypnotic, and that outro is gorgeous,"" he said. ""It's a great vocal performance and the bit at the end where he hits his falsetto, it's just great."" Like many pianists, Tankard ""cut his teeth playing in piano bars"", which means that, by default, he was going to end up playing Elton John songs. ""You're going to do I Guess That's Why They Call It Blues, you're going to do Your Song, and you're going to do Rocket Man,"" he said. While he doesn't play piano bars much these days, Tankard is currently busy playing with Goanna, Broderick Smith, Geoff Achison & The Souldiggers, and his own project Tank Dilemma, he still finds himself playing Rocket Man when he does. ""It always stands up. People stop and listen to Rocket Man, and you'll finish it and they're singing the outro,"" he said. ""I would honestly say Rocket Man is a song I would never get sick of playing."" Tankard said seeing John play it live on his farewell tour of Australia in 2019 was a highlight in a gig that showcased what made John so good in the first place. ""I didn't hear him play a single wrong note, his timing was impeccable and vocally he was great too,"" he said. ""His concert was a sheer delight … and then he disappeared in a helicopter above us. ""He's a serious piano player, he's a serious musician. I think sometimes that gets brushed over. ""It's really important not to underestimate his musicianship. Yes, he's got his flamboyance and the helicopters and all that, but he does back it up."" Rocket Man changed John's career almost overnight. ""Everything seemed to [get] bigger, louder, more excessive,"" John wrote in his autobiography. ""Bernie and I hadn't intended Rocket Man to be a huge hit single — we saw ourselves as album artists — but that's what it turned into."" The song went to number two in the UK, and number six in the US where it was triple-platinum. In Australia, it was number 13, and it was his best-selling single to date in Germany, Ireland and New Zealand. ""We'd stumbled onto a different kind of commerciality, and its success changed our audience,"" he wrote. ""Screaming girls started appearing in the front rows and outside the stage door, tearfully clinging on to the car as we tried to get away. ""It felt really peculiar as if they'd gone to see The Osmonds or David Cassidy but taken a wrong turn and somehow ended up at our gig instead."" It kicked off an incredible purple patch for John. His next seven singles went top 10 in either the UK or the US or both, and John began playing bigger and bigger venues as he sold more and more records. He matched this new-found level of fame by wearing increasingly elaborate stage costumes and living a lifestyle that matched one of the key lyrics of the song — ""burning out his fuse up here alone"". Rocket Man was one of four John songs to make Rolling Stone's 2021 list of the 500 greatest songs, with the ""soaring anthem"" coming in at number 149 — only Tiny Dancer was higher at number 47. While Tiny Dancer also has its own cinematic moment via the bus singalong in Cameron Crowe's 2000 film Almost Famous, Rocket Man leant itself to one of the key scenes in the film of the same name, in which he goes from overdose and suicide attempt to playing at Dodger Stadium via a heart-breaking yet theatrical transition. The song's legacy is also entwined in its covers. Kate Bush famously took it to number two in Australia and number 12 in the UK with a reggae version complete with uilleann pipes and concertina, while William Shatner infamously performed an unintentionally hilarious spoken word version in 1978 that has been a source of parody for more than 40 years. Rocket Man also formed part of the mash-up track Cold Heart, in which Aussie dance music trio Pnau combined a bunch of John songs with some new Dua Lipa vocals, sending John and part of Rocket Man back to the top of the charts for the first time in more than a decade. It seems that 50 years on from its release, the song detailing the ""timeless flight"" of its astronaut narrator is just that — timeless.

134,The woman who dragged a great white shark to the shallows to free it from a rope,arts-culture,"  Pioneering diver Valerie Taylor helped film Jaws, then spent her life trying to save sharks Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Valerie Taylor isn't your average 86-year-old. Instead of living out a quiet retirement, she's putting on a hot-pink wetsuit and petting sharks. ""Tiger sharks are great big pussycats, they're very easygoing,"" she says. ""I've known some pretty good tiger sharks. I know a guy who's got a giant female [tiger shark] as a pet in the ocean. She rushes over when he goes into the water. He strokes her, I've stroked her. Her name's Emma. She's a darling. You couldn't possibly hurt Emma, she's too sweet."" The spearfishing champion turned conservationist has spent much of her life challenging the public's fear of sharks. ""In a year, more people die just driving to the beach or getting bitten by dogs [than being killed by sharks]. More people drown – by a long way. ""That's all considered to be part of life. [But with sharks] it becomes a different thing, it's the big monster that nobody can see in the deep, dark, evil depths. ""It's not like that at all, in reality."" In some ways, her decades of advocacy has been about undoing the damage wrought by Jaws, the movie that did more than anything else to spread the fear of the monster in the dark, evil depths. And it's a film Taylor had a hand in creating. By the early 1970s, Valerie had made and appeared in plenty of underwater films, but it was the 1971 shark documentary, Blue Water, White Death, that really made her name as an ocean cinematographer. Universal Pictures sent Valerie and her husband, Ron, the galley proofs of Peter Benchley's novel, Jaws, about a great white shark terrorising a small town on the USA's east coast. The novel sold more than 10 million copies and was selected as up-and-coming director Steven Spielberg's second major film. Before Jaws went into production in 1974, Spielberg chose Valerie and Ron to lead an expedition to Port Lincoln, South Australia, to capture footage for the nerve-wracking scene where Richard Dreyfuss's character, Hooper, descends in a shark cage to confront the monstrous great white. Valerie and Ron were known as the first divers to film great whites underwater without the protection of a cage. As Spielberg wanted the film shark to look huge – larger than any real creature – they filmed short men in half-sized diving cages. As the crew were preparing to lower a diver, one shark got tangled in the ropes holding the empty cage to the boat. As the shark thrashed around, the whole contraption snapped off from the boat, and the shark sank with the cage and line attached (it eventually swam free). In the original script, Hooper was to be killed by the shark in this scene, but Spielberg liked the Taylors' dramatic footage so much he included it in the film and rewrote the script so that Hooper escapes from the top of the cage to safety. Jaws became the highest-grossing movie in history at the time and was the first summer blockbuster film. But to this day, Valerie has conflicted feelings about its legacy. ""I think Jaws did a lot of harm,"" she says. Valerie Taylor is just one of the women profiled on the ABC's podcast for fearless girls. Listen on the ABC listen app or wherever you get your podcasts. After the blockbuster exposed the world to the story of a killer shark with a taste for human flesh, people started going out on shark slaughtering trips, and swimmers were terrified of dark shapes in the water. Peter Benchley, the author of Jaws, said he would never have written the book if he had foreseen its implication for vulnerable shark populations. He spent the rest of his life advocating for marine conservation. Valerie Taylor points out that only five or six of the more than 400 species of shark in the ocean are potentially dangerous to humans. But that wasn't the perception held by most audiences after seeing the film. Valerie and her husband Ron toured the US and went on every talk show they could to spread the word that sharks are not man-eaters. ""I've spent a lot of time with sharks, and they're not really as bad as people would like to think,"" she says. In 1980, Valerie and Ron went as far as using themselves as human bait to prove sharks were no threat. Wearing protective chain-mail suits, they covered themselves in raw fish to coax sharks to bite them. On another occasion, Valerie and Ron were filmed dragging a distressed great white shark to the shallows to free it from a rope tangled at the base of its tail. They tagged the shark and released it back to sea. A year later, the tags were returned by a fisherman who caught the shark about two kilometres from where they'd worked to save it. Over the decades, she watched many more disappear from the ocean. ""[Jaws] was a fictitious story and a fictitious shark,"" Valerie says. ""But there was nothing to be done, all you can do is try and mend the fence."" Valerie's work on Jaws was just one chapter in an incredible life that last year was the subject of the National Geographic documentary, Playing With Sharks, directed by Sally Aitken. Valerie was born in Australia, but grew up mostly in New Zealand, and had to relearn how to walk after she was hospitalised with polio at age 12. She began diving in the 1950s before becoming a champion spearfisher — a woman in a macho blood sport. She met her husband, Ron, another spearfishing champion, and they began making underwater films together. It was a spearfishing competition in Maroochydore that changed Valerie and Ron's opinion of the sport forever, and set them on a new path. ""We had just each won the individual title of Australia,"" she says. ""He won the men's Australian title, and I won the women's. ""And we walked out of the water with our catch and dumped them with everybody else's on the beach to be weighed. There was an island offshore, and we [and the other hundred competitors] had taken every reef fish off it. And Ron looked at it and he said, 'I'm not going to do this anymore'. And I said, 'I don't want to do it either'. And we never did it again. We walked away."" Valerie and Ron moved into environmental conservation, with one of their first campaigns focused on protecting grey nurse sharks. Although they are docile and relatively harmless to humans, the grey nurse shark's fearsome appearance and reputation as a man-eater led to indiscriminate killing of the species by spear and line fishers. Today, Australia's east coast population of grey nurse sharks is critically endangered. Valerie started writing letters in support of the species being protected, and with Ron made films about their plight. ""That was the first shark in the world to ever be protected,"" she says. ""I've just gone from one thing to the next to the next to the next."" But her conservation work was not just concerned with saving sharks. She also led campaigns to protect other marine species, like the potato cod, and fought hard to establish marine parks and sanctuary zones. To this day, she has only ever killed one shark during her time in spearfishing — and it's something she still regrets. ""I didn't like doing it,"" she says. ""I don't want to kill anything."" Today, Valerie still talks passionately about conservation, and children seeing marine life with their own eyes. She's seen oceans deteriorate significantly since she first started diving. Each year, as many as 273 million sharks are killed in the world's commercial fisheries, many solely for their fins for use in shark fin soup. More than one third of all shark species and their relatives are at risk of extinction because of overfishing. ""I say thank goodness I'm so old. I've had the world when it was at its best,"" she says. ""In 1967, Ron and I scuba-dove the Great Barrier Reef from top to bottom. It took over six months, and we filmed in 35mm all the way. What we saw then doesn't exist anymore, not like that. It's gone."" Valerie lost her husband Ron to leukaemia in 2012 but has continued diving and her work with ocean conservation. She says she still wants to work on more film projects in the last years of her life. ""I like to think that I've had enough marine animals protected to have done my little bit,"" she says. ""I'll probably do it for as long as I can, but I think my body will stop me."" When she talks of an upcoming diving trip to Indonesia, the 86 year-old still sounds as excited as ever to put on her pink wetsuit and explore the coral reefs – free from gravity and some of the effects of age. ""I don't walk too good, but I float OK,"" she says. ""You never fly on land by yourself, but underwater you just spread your wings and go anywhere.""

138,The place where you can discover 'something that's become a little bit lost' in electronic music,arts-culture,"  Musicians dedicated to saving electronic instruments for the future Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian musician Gotye's international hit, Somebody That I Used to Know, was one of the biggest songs of 2011. Its incredible success allowed its creator, Wally De Backer, to feed his passion for early electronic musical instruments including the theremin, the onde martenot, and the ondioline — instruments which are considered forerunners to the synthesiser. Around the same time as his song was topping music charts around the world, electronic musicians Byron Scullin and Robin Fox came up with an idea for a unique musical archive. ""We really wanted to make a place where people could come and use these old machines and discover something that's become a little bit lost in electronic music,"" Mr Scullin said. ""A lot of people make electronic music now using iPads and laptops, but the laptop is probably the least musical instrument you can play, whereas these things have knobs and dials and lights and buttons. ""It's a physical thing and you want to interact with it."" Mr Scullin and Mr Fox went to de Backer with their idea to create the Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio (MESS). ""He thought MESS was a great idea so he gave us access to his collection and also some money to get the thing started,"" Mr Scullin said. Reading through the current MESS collection is like reading through the history of electronic music. It includes synthesisers, drum machines and many oddities from manufacturers including ARP, EMS, Korg, Moog and Roland. The studio in Melbourne is open to anyone to come and explore and play with the collection. ""MESS has this model called preservation through use. These machines have to be used all the time and have electricity running through their copper veins,"" Mr Scullin said. Having experienced MESS first hand, Emily Lee-Ack, executive officer of the South West Local Learning and Employment Network, wanted to find a way to bring part of the collection out of Melbourne and into regional Victoria. ""I had a random musing about MESS bringing some synths to the region for our young and emerging musicians to play around with. ""It was natural to ask if that was possible, rather than file the idea away,"" Ms Lee-Ack said. What started with a text message has grown into a 10-day program in Warrnambool, the first time any part of the MESS collection has travelled outside its normal home in North Melbourne. At the heart of the Warrnambool residency, dubbed South West MESS, is an intensive program aimed at young people in the 15-25 year age group. ""The challenge for young people in regional areas is that they lack the transport options of lots of other age groups, and cementing an interest and passion for music at that time in your life is really pivotal to whether or not you'll pursue it as a career or a lifelong interest,"" Ms Lee-Ack said. Bridget Dridan is studying a Certificate III Vocational Education and Training (VET) music industry course, and is one of the students who applied to be a part of South West MESS. Her first experience with electronic music was the first day of the South West MESS course. ""We came here on the first day and mucked around and figured everything out,"" she said. ""We've learnt how synthesisers work, what oscillators and filters are about, and we're working in small groups making our own pieces using these synthesisers."" Musicians Gus Franklin and Janita Foley are the creative leads on the project, which is set up in the old Fletcher Jones factory in Warrnambool. The history of the site as a clothing manufacturer has been an inspiration for the pieces being created by the students. ""We've been talking about making patterns and ideas on a sewing machine and drawing parallels between the garment work that used to happen in this factory and electronic music,"" Mr Franklin said. Ms Foley said she had been inspired by the work the students created as they got their heads around these electronic instruments for the first time. ""I've been impressed with the way they've come up with new sounds and ideas and been quite experimental,"" Ms Foley said. ""They've been like ducks to water.""

139,Fears World Heritage bid in jeopardy as historic mining town church hits the market,arts-culture,"  Moonta Mines Uniting Church on market, residents worried about UNESCO World Heritage bid Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Moonta Mines Uniting Church is an important part of the history of this South Australian town, but some residents fear its future is now at stake after being put on the market. The church was built in 1865 by members of the Wesleyan Methodist community who had migrated from Cornwall to mine copper. Among them were the great-great-grandparents of Liz Coole, president of the Yorke Peninsula Branch of the South Australian Cornish Association. ""Life back then was so simple and hard, and all they had was their religion, their church, their families and their work,"" Ms Coole said. ""It's very important to Moonta to keep that."" The property is owned by the Uniting Church, which has decided to sell it, citing a decision to close by the local congregation. Ms Coole is worried about how the heritage status of the area will be affected by losing access to a piece of local history. ""I know there's a lot of people upset that it has been put up for sale,"" she said. ""If that church is sold to a private enterprise or somebody buys it to live in, right in the middle of a heritage area, you can imagine what that would do to us."" The Moonta branch of the National Trust of South Australia administers an historic school museum, railway station, post office and miner's cottage. Branch chairman Stephen Stock is hoping to add the church where he was married to that list. ""We believe that the church originally was built by the locals. It's been looked after by the locals all its time, and it should be handed back to the community,"" he said. ""The National Trust has funds to look after this building, whereas with a private person, who knows what could happen?"" A petition to keep the church open to the public has been signed more than 1,500 times. It was started by Mr Stock's son Matthew, president of Moonta and District Progress Association. ""Small towns, we're all pretty connected, especially with such public buildings,"" Matthew said. ""They had a service there for ANZAC Day, which my husband and I attended, and it was very lovely with the organ going. ""When it comes to us getting world heritage listing, having a building intact as it was for our Cornish ancestors is such a great way for people to step back in time and get a sense of what the community was like."" The Cornish mining sites of Moonta and Burra in the northern Mount Lofty Ranges were listed on the National Heritage register in 2017. Copper Coast Council chief Russell Peate said a joint bid with the Regional Council of Goyder for UNESCO World Heritage would piggyback on Cornwell's listing in 2006. ""It will take some years to achieve, Goyder Council is the lead on it and we look forward to the day when both Moonta and Burra will be world heritage listed,"" Russell said. ""The council is very well aware of the church's heritage importance, both to Moonta and the region. ""We continue to work closely with a range of organisations, including the National Trust and Progress Association in terms of how we might progress an EOI.""

140,Ukrainian artist Vladymyr escaped shelling in his home country. It’s the silence in Australia that surprised him most,arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog With every stroke of his paint brush, Vladymyr Naumenkov pours his heart onto the canvas. The 70-year-old artist and his wife Valentyna are among a number of displaced Ukrainians currently calling the south-west Victorian city of Warrnambool home. The pair escaped their home town of Mykolaiv amid a rain of gunfire and shelling early last month, commencing a torrid 22-day trek through Europe before finally arriving in Australia. The toll of war was written across their tired faces when they finally met their daughter Olena Naumenkova at her home in regional Victoria. ""It was really terrible, they would call us between the shelling and bombs,"" Ms Naumenkova said. ""They were in the basement of their home for three days, sometimes without power as they called us. ""It was very unsafe to stay here so they decided to go very quickly."" For Mr Naumenkov, the move was world shattering. He left behind the family home, a lifetime of work and memories, and many dear friends. When he arrived in Australia, Mr Naumenkov said something unique hit him straight away. ""He says they were very surprised from silence, because they last few days they feel such big tension always expecting explosions,"" his daughter translated. ""The openness and the beauty of Australia, it was very surprising."" In Ukraine, Mr Naumenkov was an artist. When Ms Naumenkova asked a friend for any spare art supplies, she was soon inundated with paints, canvases, easels and brushes. All had been donated by locals after a social media call-out went viral locally. ""There's no doubting the people of Warrnambool,"" Ms Naumenkova said, wiping a tear. There are currently seven displaced Ukrainians calling Warrnambool home, a number expected to increase significantly once appropriate visas are sourced. The city has already hosted memorials, talent shows and music nights all to raise money for hospitals and other organisations in Ukraine. Winslow wool grower Brendan Finnegan's merino product is normally snapped up by Italy's top fashion houses. This year, he's donating the best cut to a charity auction, with all the funds going to Ukrainians caught up in Russia's war. ""I've got eight grandchildren and probably won't worry me, but for the next 50 or 60 years, if Russia prevails, it's going to have an effect on their life,"" Mr Finnegan said. ""I just felt we needed to do something, everyone needs to do something."" Since his arrival in Warrnambool, Mr Naumenkov has produced a dozen landscapes. Some are of his hometown in Ukraine, others of Victoria's southern coastline. Each is simply signed ""refugee""; a nom de plume he's recently taken on. They're set to go under the hammer at an art auction in Warrnambool as part of the local humanitarian fundraising effort. But as his daughter explains, for Mr Naumenkov, no amount of painting will be enough. ""He feels even this, it's not enough, it's like a drop in the ocean,"" Ms Naumenkova said. ""But it makes him feel better to do something useful, to do something to help. ""Sometimes, it's all we can do.""

141,'All my mob are here': Jessica Mauboy returns home to support remote community artists,arts-culture,"  Jessica Mauboy returns home to Darwin to support remote community artists Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Jessica Mauboy grew up in the outer Darwin suburb of Wulagi and she's proud to tell that to anyone who will listen. ""The street I grew up in was Pelican Street,"" she said. ""There's nothing wrong with growing up in a small town or a small suburb. ""You can make it anywhere if you really believe in it, believe in yourself and who you are."" The Darwin-born musician said memories of heading out on a dinghy to lay crab traps with her dad, local market food and the smells of the tropical city, have kept her grounded. ""There's a spirit and a sense of a connection to land, a connection to community and the people you love,"" she said. ""My mum, my dad, all my siblings, nieces and nephews, extended family, first cousins, second cousins – they're all here, all my mob are here."" ""It's a very special place."" Mauboy has returned to Larrakia country to take on a new role supporting remote community artists, who will share their works and textiles at the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair (DAAF) and related fashion shows later this year. ""It's a huge responsibility and I want to be able to share that message and be that role model that encourages mob to come out and to continue to share their story because it's important,"" she said. ""Their story is important."" As an ambassador for DAAF, Mauboy has started visiting remote art centres including Marrawuddi at Jabiru and Gunbalanya's Injaluk Arts. But she said she would be taking a back seat. ""From my point of view, from my lens, I'm being taught, I'm the listener,"" she said. After a two-year hiatus because of COVID-19, artists from remote Northern Territory communities and elsewhere in Australia will once again be able to travel long distances to share their work in person at the DAAF events in August. This comes with a promise from the event's organisers to return all the profits to artists and their communities via local art centres, with the event taking no commission. Shilo McNamee, the event's artistic director and an artist herself, went to the same high school as Mauboy. ""The art centres play a massive role in supporting artists and communities and just keeping a lot of the income streams going,"" she said ""That's something that we're trying to actively educate the public about, buying ethically and knowing where artwork has come from."" ""It's really great to see on social media that people are asking these questions."" Last year, the event went online and, with 1,730 artists from more than 70 remote art centres, generated about $3 million. ""[It's] helping these art centres support artists on country so they can work from home,"" Ms McNamee said. ""Being able to pass on their stories is a really important part of bringing artwork into the fashion space and also making sure that all collaborations are with the artists on board, so they can say what designs are appropriate to wear in what circumstances. ""The younger artists and younger generations are wearing their designs with pride, which is really great to see."" Mauboy said she also wanted to be a strong role model for younger NT residents. ""I'm sure youth are facing a lot of challenges,"" she said. ""Just trust yourself and believe in yourself more, and that takes great courage and great bravery but once you do that, I think all else just falls into place."" ""I'm still that Darwin bush kid who can be barefoot and just be.""

142,"Lust, jealousy and power are explored in latest film from Oscar-nominated director of Drive My Car",arts-culture,"  In Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, from best director Oscar nominee Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, three women grapple with jealousy and desire Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Japanese director Ryûsuke Hamaguchi was hurtled into the spotlight earlier this year when he received four Oscar nominations — and a win — for his silken Murakami adaptation Drive My Car, an arthouse crossover hit praised by many as one of the year's best films. In that 3-hour epic, the lives of characters are sent spinning by totally random, freakish interventions, like a cold snap in Vladivostok that, butterfly effect-style, ruptures a relationship in Tokyo. His latest film, the Berlin Film Festival Silver Bear-winning drama Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, might be smaller in scope, tighter in focus and just a little too odd to inspire repeat commercial success at that level — but these qualities can also be seen as its strengths. In short, the film is a perfect distillation of Hamaguchi's particular talents and peculiar obsessions, doubling down on his pet themes: chance, coincidence and the feeling of latent possibility hiding inside even the most prosaic daily interactions. The result is a fleet-footed, wistful triptych like little else playing in theatres right now — three short stories, all written by Hamaguchi, bundled into the one feather-light film in which women of different generations find themselves buffeted by the winds of fate. Hamaguchi has described the three stories as studies, investigating what it takes to make Sliding Doors-style life-bending encounters in fiction feel believable rather than false; truthful rather than just convenient, hokey and cheap. Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy nods particularly to the work of similarly playful French New Wave directors like Jacques Rivette and Éric Rohmer, whose 1995 triptych Rendez-vous in Paris Hamaguchi has cited as an influence. The first story, titled Magic (or Something Less Reassuring), is a clumsy not-quite-love triangle in which Meiko (Kotone Furukawa), a young model with flashing eyes and a bob haircut as sharp as her tongue, shares a late-night cab ride home with her friend Tsugumi (Hyunri). In the course of their conversation, Meiko discovers that the man Tsugumi recently met and shared a bewitching evening with is actually Meiko's ex Kazuaki (Ayumu Nakajima) — a fact she chooses not to disclose and that we only learn later when Meiko drops off her friend, turns the taxi around and heads straight to confront Kazuaki at his office. At once an austere boxed-in drama, marked by lots of words and little camera movement, and an existential study of jealousy, lust and power, the tale is electrified by the audience's knowledge that for every piece of information proffered, another is withheld. The motives of each character remain thrillingly ambiguous — a quality that extends to the second story, Door Wide Open. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. It begins as a tawdry tale: when Segawa (Kiyohiko Shibukawa), a weary-looking university professor, refuses to improve his student's grade, the young man (Shouma Kai) enlists his girlfriend Nao (Katsuki Mori) to try and seduce Segawa in the hope of getting him fired — the term ""honey trap"" is actually used. But in the course of the seduction, something shifts gears and Nao is drawn in by Segawa's words. As in so many of the finest moments in Hamaguchi's work — among them, the workshop scenes of his lauded 2015 ensemble film Happy Hour and the actor's rehearsal sequences in Drive My Car – something hard to pin down but undeniably tangible is happening here, as if the very atoms of the air were recalibrating around his characters. This feeling of transformation, of the flimsy borderlines between fantasy and reality collapsing in upon themselves, is felt most powerfully, though, in the final, sci-fi inflected story, Once Again. Moka (Fusako Urabe) has travelled alone from Tokyo to Sendai to attend her 20-year high school reunion. Unsurprisingly, the event is a distant, uncomfortable affair — a feeling that's perhaps amplified in this near-future world, in which an email virus has effectively wiped out the internet, leaving people to communicate through quaint old-school means like landline telephones. Follow @abc_arts on Instagram, where life and culture collide. Moka leaves, looking both relieved and disappointed, when suddenly, while riding an escalator on the street, she appears to randomly bump into an old lover. The woman, Nana (Aoba Kawai), catches her eye and turns around to greet Moka, and they decide to go to Nana's house – though an awkwardness hangs over their conversation that can't be shaken off. What happens next is all conducted in brief words, glances and gestures, but lands with the force of a Jean-Claude Van Damme high-kick. The two women engage in a bizarre game of identity-swapping that betrays their need for human connection. All through the vignettes of Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy, there are intensely seductive moments like this, of human desire and plangent yearning, of kindness, cruelty and disgust. But an imaginative element is also always lurking and Hamaguchi clearly delights in the possibilities of performance and the spaces that it can cleave open. These three short stories may be small and contained, but, like a Proustian madeleine, they each act as gateways to buried memories and nourishing fantasy.

143,"'An insane honour': Young First Nations poet wins $60,000 prize for women and non-binary writers",arts-culture,"  Stella Prize won by young First Nations poet Evelyn Araluen for her provocative debut collection Dropbear Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Evelyn Araluen has won the $60,000 Stella Prize for her playful and searing debut collection of poetry and prose, Dropbear, which was described by the prize judges as ""breathtaking"". Her win was announced by Miles Franklin-winning Bundjalung author and judging panel chair Melissa Lucashenko at an event at the State Library Victoria in Melbourne on Thursday night. ""Dropbear is remarkably assured for a debut poetry collection, and I think we can safely say it announces the arrival of a stunning new talent to Australian literature,"" Lucashenko said. Araluen, a descendant of the Bundjalung Nation born in Dharug Country and now based in Naarm/Melbourne, began writing poetry while she was studying her great-grandfather's language at TAFE, becoming attuned to poetic techniques like fragmentation and different sentence structures. ""I honestly don't think I would have become a poet if I hadn't started learning that language,"" she told ABC Arts in 2021. Araluen is only the second Aboriginal writer to win the prize in its 10-year history – after Waanyi writer Alexis Wright in 2018. ""To be given the same prize that Alexis Wright has been given is just so confusing to me. It's an insane honour,"" Araluen told ABC Arts. At 29, the poet, researcher and co-editor of progressive literary journal Overland is also the youngest ever winner of the Stella – and it's a prize she's always wanted to win. She has followed the Stella since she started her writing career about seven years ago, dreaming that she would win the prize for her (forthcoming) debut novel. But then, this year, the Stella Prize broadened its eligibility criteria to include poetry — and Dropbear was among three collections that made the shortlist, alongside a novel, an experimental essay, and a graphic novel. ""When I wrote Dropbear I didn't expect that the Stella would be open for poetry. I really did think that I was going to have to write a novel or a non-fiction book to have been considered,"" Araluen says. ""It's been so bizarre for things to happen [in my career] so much faster than I was anticipating."" Dropbear is structured in three sections: GATHER, SPECTRE and DEBRIS. The poems in each section range from hopeful, even romantic, to overtly political and teasing, often conjuring vivid imagery of the Australian landscape, and touching on subjects like Black Lives Matter and the pandemic. A number of pieces, including PYRO and Breath, are visceral in their descriptions of life during Australia's catastrophic bushfire season of 2019-20. ""AGAIN WE ARE UNHEARD AS WE SPEAK KNOWINGS WE HAVE CARRIED TO CARE FOR THIS PLACE THROUGH RECKONING // … I WROTE THIS POEM AT A DESK COVERED IN ASH,"" Araluen writes in PYRO. Araluen's poems are also marked by their defiance of Eurocentric poetic conventions; they often use white space and punctuation in novel ways to comment on the impact of colonisation. In Fern Up Your Own Gully, she writes: ""fern up the gully girls / go live those pastel bush dreams / while me and my ancestors sit         pissed swinging on / the verandah couch."" The collection is peppered with references to the Australian literature and pop culture Araluen grew up with – from 1971 film Wake in Fright and 1992's FernGully: The Last Rainforest to Blinky Bill and Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, and the works of poets including Les Murray, Banjo Paterson and Kenneth Slessor. ""The main inspiration of Dropbear really was to provide an honest depiction of my relationship with Australian literature,"" Araluen explains. ""This is my annotation to an Australian literary tradition that never imagined me as a reader; that actively sought to erase me from the culture and from the nation it was describing; and that at the end of the day still has some kind of aesthetic claim over my tastes."" Her answer to that influence over her tastes is to deconstruct those stories, illuminating and problematising myths about Australia and Australianness – often with a sense of humour. The poet reads from her work on ABC's Art Works In Mrs Kookaburra Addresses the Natives, Araluen uses the words of May Gibbs to draw attention to how Aboriginal peoples and their countries have been represented in children's literature. ""Such festive spirits we were in and against / as Snugglepot and Cuddlepie held corrobboree / for the native bears at White City®."" It's a powerful reclaiming of language to illuminate colonial attitudes. ""The ambition with a lot of my poetry is to create a space for play, for snarkiness, for sarcasm, for challenge, that is about empowering a sense of confidence, of ease,"" Araluen told ABC Arts in 2021. ""It's about embodying this idea that's never been extended to First Nations about the larrikin spirit."" Even though she felt erased by the Australian literary canon, Araluen is now part of a flourishing movement of First Nations writers. ""We're in one of the most exciting times for Black writing I think that we've ever seen,"" Araluen told ABC TV's Art Works in 2021. Wiradjuri author Tara June Winch won the Miles Franklin in 2020, while Gunaikurnai woman Veronica Gorrie this year won the $100,000 Victorian Prize for Literature. Araluen's Stella Prize win is another example in a recent history of the publishing industry paying attention to First Nations poetry in particular – including Mununjali Yugambeh poet Ellen van Neerven's sweep of the NSW Premier's Literary Awards in 2021. ""There is a real noticeable change each year, and we see greater inclusion and engagement, not simply in prize lists but also in reviews and in the way that poetry is acknowledged in festivals,"" says Araluen. She gives the credit for this growing recognition to the women who have come before her – pointing to late Wiradjuri poet and activist Aunty Kerry Reed-Gilbert and late Goernpil writer Lisa Bellear. ""I see that [recent recognition] as a representation of decades of work done by others to get us to this point,"" she says. She also points to the influence of contemporaneous First Nations poets, including Narungga woman Natalie Harkin, Gomeroi writer Alison Whittaker, and van Neerven. ""We are all so in love with each other's work,"" Araluen says. Speaking at the Stella Prize ceremony on Thursday night, Araluen acknowledged the influence of other women writers on her work. ""Every opportunity, every prize, every publication, every success of my career has borne the touch of women, but especially Black women, and they have made my presence here possible,"" she said. ""I'll spend my life searching for ways to thank them for what they've given to generations of storytellers like myself."" Five First Nations authors made the Stella longlist this year, with Wiradjuri author Anita Heiss, Wiradjuri artist and writer S.J Norman, and Mununjali and South Sea Islander academic Chelsea Watego, joining the shortlisted Araluen and Noongar and Yawuru writer Elfie Shiosaki. ""What a beautiful little community of incredible Black people,"" says Araluen. ""It's so exciting and I've loved all of their works as well … I really think that [Chelsea Watego's] Another Day in the Colony is one of those books that everyone needs to read."" But the strong representation of First Nations writers in the shortlist was met with a negative response in The Australian, with readers quoted saying the longlist was an example of ""politics"" and ""overcorrection"". At the time, Araluen described the article as ""dog whistling"". ""I get to be proud of what I achieved, to share it with my family without making them feel worried about what people might think,"" she added. She tells ABC Arts that narratives like this ignore First Nations peoples' strong storytelling tradition, as well as their work supporting one another. ""We are doing everything that we can to help each other publish and write and get out there,"" she says. ""It's just such a miserable and cynical thing to say … People should be ashamed that they can't look at something as exciting and as powerful as that list without trying to create drama. ""But having said all of that, we're used to being positioned as some kind of controversial discussion piece for the sake of a white audience … So, what's new? Get a better line, I guess?"" While the Stella is usually worth $50,000, Araluen was awarded an extra $10,000 following a successful fundraising campaign to ensure the future of the prize. The Stella Forever Fund raised $3 million, including $1 million from philanthropist and former Stella deputy chair, Paula McLean. That money will allow the Stella to keep running in perpetuity. Follow @abc_arts on Instagram, where life and culture collide. The prize money will give Araluen herself some financial security. ""Last year, I was completely f***ing broke,"" she says. ""I do actually really think that [prizes are] important for writers and it can completely change someone's life."" She plans to use some of the money to pay her tax bill and to pay down her HECS debt, as well as to go towards the cost of her wedding to her partner – her co-editor on Overland, Jonathan Dunk – later this year. For now, she is working on her debut novel, about an Aboriginal person navigating Australian literary history and culture. She's juggling that with two academic jobs in Melbourne, and the editor role at Overland. ""It's hard to find a time and place for writing,"" she says. In her acceptance speech, Araluen explained that her experience working a number of jobs is all too common for artists. ""Artists, in this country anyway, are used to instability … We're used to living one pay cheque away from poverty. ""Despite this slap in the face, this blunt dismissal of the clear social and cultural good the arts provides to all Australians, artists were still advocating and organising throughout the pandemic, and the fires and the floods. They were still working through the isolation of endless lockdowns in the hope that their creative efforts, their work, would help someone else survive."" She called for greater support of artists and arts workers. ""I don't want the dignity and the peace this prize provides to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a handful of the lucky ones though,"" she said. ""If you hold legislative influence, if you work in government or in philanthropy or in a position of other influence I beg you to think of the responsibility you bear to your community, and the influence you might lead. The arts are also our country, and I beg you to care for it."" The $60,000 sum brings the Stella on par with the Miles Franklin Award, with whom the prize shares a namesake. The creation of the Stella in 2012 was partly inspired by the underrepresentation of women in the Miles Franklin; no women were on the 2011 shortlist. But the Stella Prize has been criticised in the past for its association with Franklin, who was a member of a Nazi-inspired movement in Australia during WWII. Writer and editor Alison Croggon described the exaltation of Franklin as part of the ""legacy of white supremacy in our national literature"" in a 2020 tweet. Araluen says: ""Two of our major literary prizes are named after the same individual who has fascist affiliations and histories."" ""Australia has this inextricable history of settler-colonial, imperial-fascist, white supremacist affiliations. We would be stupid to pretend that it's not there. But should we be placing the emphasis on artists, on writers, on precariat workers to be constantly shouldering the burden of redressing structural issues?"" It's not up to individual artists to reject the prize money, she says. At the same time, she is critical of making superficial tweaks — like changing the name – instead of addressing structural issues. ""A name is not anywhere near as important as ensuring that an organisation has structures and systems set up for advocacy; that it is taking on guidance and advice from different sections of the community; that it's ensuring that all of its opportunities are accessible,"" says Araluen. In early 2021, Araluen was part of a consultation group engaged by the Stella Prize to discuss the issues facing writers and how the organisation could address concerns about service delivery, inclusivity and accessibility. She says: ""If they turned around and they said, 'Listen, we could change the name of the Stella and it would cost X amount of money' — and it would probably be a large sum – 'or we could spend that money running workshops in marginalised communities supporting writers,' I would 100 per cent pick the latter."" In a statement provided to ABC Arts in March, Stella executive director Jaclyn Booton said: ""We have considered Stella's name and consulted with a range of people from across the literary, academic, and philanthropic sectors on what a change might mean … Deeply entrenched connections between literature, racism, and power are being challenged, thanks in no small part to the work of First Nations people and writers of colour. Stella is committed to amplifying the voices of these writers."" Araluen hopes that her win – and the inclusion of poetry in the Stella Prize – will help Australian poets reach a wider audience and create further opportunities for them. ""There is some possibility here to really encourage people to start reading outside of their comfort zone and to realise that there's more out there than just fiction,"" she says. It is difficult in a small market like Australia for poets to find a publisher, says Araluen — not only for full-length collections, but for experimental and niche work. ""How do we advocate for more poetry? How do we advocate for other opportunities?"" Araluen asks. ""I'm hoping that with the Stella including poetry, and with how many amazing poetry collections were on that shortlist and the longlist, that publishers are going to really consider making the effort to back more new releases of Australian poetry. ""[Hopefully] we'll see in the next few years a radically different market and space for Australian poetry publishing."" Dropbear is out now through University of Queensland Press.

144,Sellout show tipped when Grammy winners Kings of Leon head to Mildura in October,arts-culture,"  Kings of Leon to play one-off regional gig in Mildura for up to 15,000 people Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog American rock band Kings of Leon will play a gig in regional Victoria later this year, and Mildura locals hope the event can attract thousands to the state's north-west. Up to 15,000 people will be able to see the Grammy Award-winning four-piece band at the Mildura Sporting Precinct on October 29, with tickets going on sale at 12pm on May 3. Making the announcement in Mildura on Thursday, Minister for Major Events Martin Pakula said he expected a sellout show for the band's only gig in a regional city. ""We would expect people to be coming from all through the eastern part of South Australia, particularly given that [Kings of Leon] are not going to be playing a show in Adelaide,"" he said. ""Off the back of Foo Fighters in Geelong and indeed Katy Perry in Bright … we know how popular big global rock bands in regional Victoria can be."" It will be the first major event of its kind to be held at the new $44-million Mildura Sporting Precinct in south Mildura. Mayor Liam Wood said while he ""wasn't sure of the logistics"", Kings of Leon would bring their own stage for the performance. ""We're talking about a band that has sold more than 20 million albums, so I think their stage will be a bit bigger than Nowingi Place [in Mildura],"" he said. ""I think it would take up the training oval at the precinct and more. I imagine it will take up a massive amount of room. ""And what a fantastic backdrop with the vines near the stadium."" Cr Wood said he was also hopeful the event would speed up other works at the stadium, with stage two of the development including outdoor seating beginning soon. ""It takes these events sometimes to really push to get things organised and push things forward,"" he said. Mildura Regional Development chief executive Brett Millington said he was certain the act would attract people from far and wide. ""There will be huge benefits to our region from outsiders coming in, attracting people that might not have otherwise considered Mildura as a destination,"" he said. ""As an example, a couple from Perth came [to Mildura's SummerSalt Festival in March] because they wanted to see Birds of Tokyo play by the river. ""It's a unique destination in that context and it can attract different people to our market."" Independent member for Mildura Ali Cupper compared the announcement to when Mildura hosted Triple J's One Night Stand in 2014. ""How amazing that was for our town — the atmosphere was incredible and we just looked so cool, the visitors we had walking through the streets, you could feel the buzz,"" she said. ""I can imagine a similar feel and look and bounce out of this."" ABC Mildura Swan Hill will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

145,Old Parliament House reopens to the public four months after fire damages historical building,arts-culture,"  Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House reopened to the public after repair of fire-damaged building Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog After being closed for almost four months due to extensive fire damage, the Museum of Australian Democracy will officially reopen to the public today. Daryl Karp, director of the museum at Old Parliament House, said she was most excited about ""the idea of having people in the building"". ""An empty museum is really not a fun place to be,"" she said. On December 30 last year, the front doors were set alight during a protest held at the front of the building. It resulted in a large police presence and multiple charges laid against protesters allegedly involved. The blaze also forced the museum to close, as repair work costing $5 million got underway. At the time, Ms Karp said entering the building broke her heart, as all surfaces were ""covered in this grimy soot, and there's just this overwhelming … grey, dusty, smelly residue"". Although visitors will be welcomed back into the museum today, repairs to the front doors and steps are continuing. Ms Karp said the works will not be finished for at least the next few months, so visitors will need to use the alternative entrance where the Terrace Cafe used to be. ""But we really felt it was important to have a Museum of Australian Democracy, one that explores these really big issues about what it means to be an engaged citizen and particularly in the lead-up to an election, we really thought it was important that we got open as quickly as we could,"" Ms Karp said. The museum will also be opening with a new exhibition called Democracy DNA: The People, Prime Ministers, and Their Times. Ms Karp said the new permanent exhibition will explore the roles of previous prime ministers of Australia in the context of their time leading the nation. ""And I think that was the really important thing that we set out to try to do, which was to put the people at the centre, us the voters, us the citizens, us the people whose needs the government should be meeting,"" she said. ""And with an election coming up, what a great way to have our voices heard."" Former prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott, who are two of the five new patrons of the museum, will also be attending the reopening, and will be answering questions from primary and high school students. Ms Karp said they will be having a conversation about ""what it is like being a prime minister and leading the nation, and the difficulties of the decisions they have had to make"". ""And any advice they would give to them as young people who might be considering ways they can engage with democracy,"" she said.

146,I'm non-verbal and often get talked down to. I also have an Order of Australia,arts-culture,"  Tasmanian artist, author Janelle McMillan on her everyday battle to be understood Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog I live in two different worlds. One of respect, acceptance and understanding when I am behind safe walls at home, but the other is filled with misunderstanding, judgement, disrespect, ignorance and sometimes downright rudeness out there in our community. I am fighting a war every day to get people to see who I really am and stop the discrimination, just because a large number of people want to stick their heads in the sand. I am smart. I've been awarded an Order of Australia and I love raising money for charity. I have even published a children's book. I also have been made to feel like a child, talked down to, patted on the head like a dog and made to feel invisible, like Harry Potter under his invisibility cloak. I have cerebral palsy (CP), which for me means I have trouble talking and my body movements are jerky and uncontrolled. It is really like living with an annoying little brother 24/7, but I don't get a break from his tricks or pranks being played on my body. He never gives up annoying me. Living in Tasmania, I am one of the 1.2 million Australians that have a communication disability — I have complex communication challenges every day of my life. Peta never imagined she'd join the throng of Insta influencers posting to the social media platform. Now she's growing a supportive community and embracing the platform's ""unique"" power. I could use a communication device to talk to people but have chosen to use my own voice instead. I have been communicating by using ""Nell Talk"" for over 25 years. People can learn to understand me through time spent listening to how I say the words. I also spell out words when people can't understand. I am in control of my life and make my own decisions. Not everyone with a disability is as lucky as I am or lives their life how they want. I am an artist and an author. In 2020, I published my first children's book called Rafting, A Wheelchair Won't Stop Us, thanks to the support of Outside The Box/Earth Arts Rights, which is a non-profit association here in Tasmania. The idea of the book is to grow inclusion and a better understanding of people with disabilities for future generations of children. So that these children will develop passion, empathy and respect as they grow into adults. You can find my book in every Tasmanian school, along with teaching notes and a short film. In 2020, I was also awarded an Order of Australia for service to the community through charitable fundraising initiatives. I have raised a lot of money for breast cancer research. My passion is advocating that non-verbal people have a voice. I love pushing the boundaries and making people think outside the box. Dad is my inspiration. In his terrible luck, he went from a capable bloke to someone who needed 24-hour support after having a brain aneurysm and a stroke. He couldn't string a sentence together. It was heartbreaking for me as a nine-year-old child to witness. This is what has driven me to push myself over the years. I consider myself the lucky one. For all of these life goals that I have achieved so far, you wouldn't think that discrimination and the lack of understanding about my intellectual capabilities would still be present in 2022, but it still is. It is very frustrating to have people treat me like I am a child. A large number of people will talk down to me when I go out into the community. People will talk to the person who is with me, about me, like I am not there. This happens to me a lot. And imagine people constantly not actually believing what you've said. That happens to me. People in high places say, 'How do we know what Janelle really said', because whoever is interpreting can make it up. But they don't think to ask me if an interpretation is correct — my yes and no responses are as clear as day. When you have a communication disability I find people turn into mind readers. They always have very interesting assumptions about what I am thinking or what I want to say. This is where a bit of swearing comes in really handy. I pity the poor buggers who have to do the interpreting for me. They have to stop themselves from laughing so much because they understood that I have sworn under my breath. My experience is not unique. Did you know there are 1.2 million Australians living with a communication disability, stemming from a wide range of disabilities? These disabilities could range from cerebral palsy, autism, Down syndrome, hearing impairment, strokes, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease and brain trauma, to name a few. My advice to you is: don't judge non-verbal people or people who are living with complex communication challenges from the outside because they have feelings and thoughts just like you. Don't be scared about people with communication disabilities. Just be yourself. People need to accept that communication might take a bit longer for us, but we do have a lot to say by using different methods of communication because our bright minds work overtime. Narrow minds are the only thing that will stop us from making our imprint on the world. A single hello can start a conversation with everyone and not just non-verbal people or people who are living with complex communication challenges, but all people. Being kind does go a long way.

148,'One from the Heart' free concert for flood-affected Northern Rivers residents,arts-culture,"  Lime Cordiale, Paul Kelly, Grinspoon headline Lismore concert for flood-affected Northern Rivers residents Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Some of Australia's biggest names in music will be headlining a free concert aimed at lifting the spirits of flood-affected Northern Rivers residents. Music promoter Michael Chugg said he was horrified by the mind-blowing mess left by the recent floods and welcomed the opportunity to pull together a free concert for the community. ""We were taken by the resilience of the general public here and we gave ourselves a shot at getting a concert up on May 15,"" he said. ""We normally take six months to set up a show like this, but we're three weeks in and we've got two weeks to go. ""It's an incredible line-up of talent and it should be a fun day."" The line-up for the 'One from the Heart' concert includes Daryl Braithwaite, Paul Kelly and Dan Kelly, The Buckleys, Sheppard, Darlinghurst, Lime Cordiale, Jon Stevens and Lismore's own Grinspoon. Households from some of the hardest-hit postcodes including Lismore and surrounds — 2480 — as well as the lower Richmond (postcodes 2471, 2472) qualify for four free tickets to the event, which will be held on Sunday, May 15. There will also be an additional 1,000 tickets for purchase for anyone outside the nominated postcodes, which will go on sale this Saturday. Lismore Mayor Steve Krieg was one of the thousands of north coast residents to lose his family home and business in the floods. He said the recent Anzac Day commemorations brought home just how much flood-affected residents needed events that brought the community together. ""Cleaning up after a flood is a very isolating event; you feel like you're alone a lot of the time,"" he said. ""This gives [people] something to look forward to [and it's] just a day to take your mind off the grind that we're living through at the moment. ""It's really a thank you to the people of Lismore for everything that they've had to put up with, everything that we've got to put up with in the future as well."" Mr Chugg said concerts were not cheap endeavours, so it was a huge win to have the funding and support to run an event that could offer free tickets to so many flood-affected residents. ""To do a line-up like that at a normal concert would cost $600,000 to $700,000 just for the bands alone,"" he said. ""So to get those bands all working for nothing basically, just the cost of getting here, is really rewarding and shows how generous the Australian music industry can be."" Organisers said the event would have capacity for about 11,000 people. ABC North Coast will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday. Sign up to stay connected.

149,Why Harvard's famous 'crocodile with flippers' fossil was dynamited from Queensland ground,arts-culture,"  Prehistoric crocodile fossil, Kronosaurus queenslandicus, lingers far from home at Harvard Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A world-famous specimen of a prehistoric marine reptile named after Queensland has sat at Harvard University in the United States for about 90 years. Outback Kronosaurus tourism founder Rob Ievers says the rare find should remain at Harvard because moving it could damage the fossil Central Queensland fossil education guide and enthusiast Phil Hore would like to see the world's only mounted Kronosaurus queenslandicus returned to the state. The species lived between 120 to 200 million years ago and belongs to an extinct group of reptiles known as plesiosaurs, with the last dying in a mass extinction event with dinosaurs. Mr Hore said he believed the Harvard fossil was ""one of the biggest ones ever found"". ""The closest thing would be maybe if you think of a crocodile with flippers, that is as big as a sperm whale and with the head the size of basically a small truck,"" he said. ""I've never understood why Queensland hasn't … tried to actually get it back from Harvard."" But Queensland Museum palaeontologist Espen Knutsen said the specimen was ""scientifically useless"" and it would be better for researchers to hunt for new specimens in western parts of the state. ""Harvard dug out a couple Kronosaurus specimens and took them back to Harvard in America and they sat there for a few decades before some amateur came along who was interested in seeing it restored,"" he said. ""They reconstructed a lot of things and added some bits here and there and pretty much coated most of the skeleton in plaster. ""Most palaeontologists call this specimen the 'plasterosaurus' because its such a reconstructed skeleton. ""I think it'd be more worthwhile to spend some more time and money and go out and find better specimens here."" In fact, Dr Knutsen said the Harvard reptile at almost 13 metres long is exaggerated in size thanks to its reconstruction. He said while it was difficult to estimate the size of the creature with only partial skeletons, some natural samples were about 10 metres long. The specimen now lies in Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The museum was contacted for comment but did not answer whether the university would consider returning the fossil. Director Gonzalo Giribet said the fossil was purchased from the McNamara family in Queensland. ""The MCZ has maintained a longstanding relationship with the descendants of the owner of the ranch who sold the specimen, several of whom have visited the MCZ even as recently as September 2017,"" Professor Giribet said. ""The MCZ made one cast of the fossil snout and donated it to the Queensland Museum in 1974."" Founder of Richmond's Kronosaurus Korner, Rob Ievers, has devoted the last 27 years of his life to the ancient marine reptile. Surprisingly, he does not believe Harvard's fossil should be returned to its homeland. ""To have that fossil returned to Richmond that would be very, very difficult. It's possible some damage could be done to it,"" Mr Ievers said. ""It was given in good faith at the time, nobody else wanted it, and they've done years and years of prep work [on the fossil] that comes at a great cost."" The fossil was found on a property called Army Downs, 40 kilometres north of Richmond in western Queensland, sometime just after World War I. The property owner was reportedly happy to donate the fossil to visiting American archaeologists. Mr Ievers said that the method it was extracted from the earth was very different to how fossils are handled today. ""It was actually dynamited out of the ground, believe it or not, and packed into big crates,"" he said. ""Then they packed wool in around the fossil, and then it was shipped overseas to the United States."" Despite its harsh treatment, Mr Ievers said the fossil was still extraordinarily rare. ""It's not everyday that you stumble across a fossil of Kronosaurus. You have to be extremely lucky,"" he said. The state government is asking Queenslanders to vote for their favourite fossil to add to the state's nine official emblems to recognise the importance of fossils to the tourism industry. The list of 12 dinosaurs, including the Kronosaurus and Muttaburrasaurus, was made after feedback from museums, tourism organisations, and councils. Mr Hore said he thought the Kronosaurus queenslandicus should win. ""It's in the name,"" he said. ABC Capricornia will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday.

150,Wedge-tailed eagles gather for vulture act in stunning photo,arts-culture,"  Bird watcher's Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle photo shows group's vulture-like behaviour Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An amateur photographer says he was in the right place at the right time when he captured nine wedge-tailed eagles in one shot. James Hanslow was birdwatching in Tasmania's Southern Midlands when he spotted a large group of the endangered raptors in a paddock. ""I've seen a family group of five before, but this was just a fluke,"" he said. ""I just thought, 'Wow, that's pretty awesome.' ""I was in the right place at the right time and the sun was setting to give it that orangey glow. I was stoked."" Mr Hanslow is a former sculptor and first started taking photos of eagles to get more realistic details of the birds for his art. His son bought him a digital SLR camera last year so he could upgrade from a camera phone and said spotting eagles was a hobby. ""They are pretty impressive,"" he said. ""I think they are a magnificent-looking bird and we are lucky to have them around."" According to the latest statistics from the Tasmanian government, the total adult population of wedge-tailed eagles in the state is estimated at less than 1,000. Wildlife biologist Nick Mooney said it was uncommon to see a large group of eagles gathering, but had spotted up to 16 birds at once while conducting surveys. He said eagle numbers were restoring in Tasmania and group sightings were becoming less rare. ""This is usually after breeding when the birds aren't strongly territorial,"" he said. Mr Mooney said the group was a mixture of immature eagles and adults. ""All the birds from a particular catchment will gather in the one place where there's a lot of food,"" he said. ""Australia doesn't have vultures, but the eagles will do partly the same job. ""It tells you they've got together for a reason, and it's always food."" Mr Mooney said the eagles would be gathering because there was dead and dying native wildlife in the area, as well as stock. He said wildlife could get toxoplasmosis and become weak, while stock could get perennial rye grass staggers during this time of year — a condition caused by eating a type of fungus. ""There's a lot of dead animals and sick animals, and that's very interesting to eagles,"" Mr Mooney said. Mr Mooney said when one eagle spotted a carcass or sick animal other tended to follow. ""If they are hunting they'll be more dispersed because they don't want competition,"" he said. ""When they gather they puff themselves up and strut around on the ground to intimidate their neighbour."" Mr Hanslow said there were sheep in the area where he took the photo and he had noticed wool on the ground. ""It does look like they were feeding on something,"" he said. Mr Mooney said the juvenile eagles liked to get in on the action and learn from the older birds. He said the gatherings occurred on a more grand scale on mainland Australia in groups of up to 40. ""I reckon it's fantastic,"" he said. The Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle is a different subspecies but looks very similar to its mainland cousins. Mr Mooney said white-bellied sea eagles also gathered in large groups when they were picking off fish and juvenile shearwaters, with sightings occurring in the north-west and at Port Davey. ""It's an impressive sight and something we're not used to,"" he said. Mr Mooney said the best spot to see multiple wedge-tailed eagles in Tasmania was at Lemont, east of Oatlands.

151,'It's the role of a lifetime': Art mirrors life as finally a transgender actor is cast as queen of the desert  ,arts-culture,"  Transgender actor Vonni lands 'role of a lifetime' in Gold Coast Priscilla production Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert hit movie screens in 1994, the lead role of transgender character Bernadette Bassenger was played by male English actor Terrence Stamp. In 2006 the musical theatre version was first performed in Sydney and travelled around the world, including Broadway in the United States, and male actors were almost always cast in the role of Bernadette. But now transgender performer Yvonne Britain, whose stage name is Vonni, has been cast in the lead role of the Gold Coast production, in what is believed to be an Australian-first. The Adelaide performer said it was the role of a lifetime. ""I am absolutely honoured and thrilled,"" she said. ""Absolutely beside myself to say that I will be playing Bernadette."" Vonni auditioned for the role and has been cast alongside pop artist, Paulini, and transgender cabaret performer Carlotta, who was an original member of the long-running Sydney-based male revue, Les Girls. ""I was part of Les Girls and Bernadette's character is a retired Les Girls performer,"" Vonni said. ""I've toured around Australia, I've toured in a bus. ""I've lived the life of the person that I'm portraying."" Producer Matt Ward said the casting of Bernadette's character was based on talent. ""We chose Vonni, not because she was transgender, but because she was the best performer for the role,"" he said. ""It's an honour to share the story of Bernadette and it's important to our team to make casting choices that elevate the humanity of her story."" Krissy Johnson, from Australia Transgender Support Association Queensland (ATSAQ), said the casting of Vonni in the role was wonderful news. ""I think a lot of people in the wider community have probably seen the original Priscilla Queen of the Desert, but this will show that we're not that scary,"" she said. ""Bernadette was not that scary."" Vonni said more producers of theatre and film needed to give transgender people an opportunity to play transgender roles. ""We're out there, we're not under a brick,"" she said. First Day explores the challenges associated with 12-year-old transgender girl Hannah Bradford’s first year of high school. ""If they audition and they're not suitable then don't cast them, move on. ""At least give them a chance and they might surprise you."" The musical tells the story of two drag queens and a trans woman who head west from Sydney in a bus to perform a drag show in Alice Springs.

153,'Ongoing legacy' of Broome's Indigenous and multicultural heritage on show in Tiny Oz,arts-culture,"  Tiny Oz reveals Broome's Indigenous and multicultural heritage in miniature Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Months of toil for historians and miniature enthusiasts will come to fruition as a depiction of Broome's history hits television screens across Australia tonight. ABC's Tiny Oz features craftspeople from around Australia who re-create their local history — in miniature. Tonight's episode of Tiny Oz will shine a spotlight on the northern WA town through a handmade model built by local carpenter and hobbyist Lachlan Fraser. The model portrays Broome's Indigenous heritage, pearling industry, and multiculturalism depicting the area now known as Chinatown. ""It's been my fascination within my 37 years of living here,"" Mr Fraser says. ""If we don't understand the history — where and how Broome came to be — we will not understand where we are today."" To make hulls for his miniature pearl luggers, Mr Fraser carved beechwood from the planks of an old lugger. Comedian Jimmy Rees and tiny craft artist JoAnne Bouzianis-Sellick unite with the extraordinary craftspeople of Australia to re-create remarkable moments from our nation's history, in glorious miniature. Other figures and items are mostly made from light gauge wire and gap filler, while corrugated iron roofs are made from corrugated cardboard and spray-painted. The model includes genuine local pindan soil. Mr Fraser and his assistants worked seven days a week for nearly six months and he is ""both terrified and hopeful"" about finally seeing it on the screen. ""Terrified because I've put my heart and soul on the sleeve here, but I'm excited for the fact that, in making this, I may answer some questions, but I hope to invoke a thousand more,"" he says. Broome-based filmmaker Paul Bell was involved in the production and says it was ""a great project to work on"". ""We went out with [Yawuru man] Bart Pigram to pick out some of the actual wood that was used in the making of [Streeter's] Jetty … to make the pylons exactly as they would have been with the correct timber, but miniaturised,"" he says. ""It's just such an interesting history that goes with the model. ""I suppose that's the idea of the series. It's looking at a moment in time somewhere in Australia and pulling it apart and really studying it through the making of that diorama."" Co-host and miniaturist JoAnne Bouzianis-Sellick came to Broome for the episode. ""Lachie's piece has just got this beautiful tactile handcrafted feel to it, using everyday objects,"" she said. ""He's very, very passionate about Broome's history and you can see it throughout the whole model. ""The scenes that are created are actually from historical photographs."" After filming the program, the producers donated the model back to Mr Fraser and it is now on display in the University of Notre Dame library in Broome. ""It is an ongoing legacy,"" Mr Fraser says. ""Hopefully it will outlast me."" Tiny Oz airs at 8:30pm Tuesday on ABC TV and ABC iview. ABC Kimberley will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

155,Aboriginal stick-fighting shield returned after 60-year gap,arts-culture,"  Aboriginal shield returned to country 60 years after croc hunters 'collected' it from banks of Mitchell River Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A shield, used during traditional stick fights between Aboriginal men of the Kowanyama region, has been returned to country more than 60 years after it was ""collected"" by a group of crocodile hunters. The shield was found on the banks of the Mitchell River by three Brisbane men on an expedition to Cape York in 1959 and secreted away as a curio. Viv Sinnamon, assisting manager and curator of the Kowanyama Collection, said he was contacted by a Brisbane man last month who had been given the shield, alongside a cutting from a 1959 Queensland Times Article detailing the croc hunters' adventures to the region. ""He was quite anxious; he'd been trying for quite a while to get the shield home,"" Mr Sinnamon said. ""He was excited once he made contact and had worked out where it had come from. ""To people here a spear is more than a spear and a shield is more than a shield — it's the story behind it, the knowledge of how to make it and the things they were used for that really interests everybody."" Mr Sinnamon said the shield was made from softwood, which showed it was not for ceremonial use. ""It's probably made of what we call crocodile tree or alligator tree; botanically it's called Gyrocarpus americanus,"" he said. ""They were basically just used for stick fighting, and they were made out of softwood because it took the concussion of the blow. ""To allow you to drop your shield to the ground to protect your shins, the leg of the shield from the handle at the back was longer than the top part. ""That allowed you to protect your head and your shins and your elbows from blows."" Mr Sinnamon said when he first arrived in Kowanyama in the 1970s people were still stick fighting in the traditional way. ""It really is a martial art; it isn't just a matter of running out and whacking someone on the head with a stick,"" he said. ""There are all these amazing poses and stances and drops and blocks and things that it almost looks like a dance."" The shield is now on display in Kowanyama, where Mr Sinnamon hopes it will inspire artists and younger generations. ""The Kowanyama collection is quite extensive and one of the key reasons for the collection is the transmission of cultural knowledge to younger generations and the maintenance of that knowledge,"" Mr Sinnamon said. ""It's essentially a reference piece, and particularly for the artisans that are the shield makers. ""We have a nice growing group of men who, some of them at least, have made shields for the first time in their lives and done a really good job of it."" Shield making workshops are ongoing in Kowanyama with an exhibition planned for the return of the Cairns Indigenous Art Fair after a two-year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic.

156,"'A new girl turns 18 every day', but these strippers are pushing for a safer work environment",arts-culture,"  Strippers create online hub for dancers to take a stand against alleged exploitative work culture Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It took a colleague telling her she was sexually assaulted at the strip club they both worked at for Luna* to take a stand against what she describes as an exploitative work culture. Luna had worked as a stripper in Adelaide for a number of years when, she alleges, a colleague was assaulted as she performed a private dance at The Firm. ""She was left alone with her customer for quite a long period of time,"" she said. ""There were no cameras, we didn't have any sort of duress buttons and there was no security up there,"" she said of where the alleged assault occurred. ""She ended up being sexually assaulted and in that instance, she had no way to actually reach out for help either, so she was quite literally trapped there."" Luna said she raised concerns about the lack of safety measures to protect dancers with their employer, Adelaide strip club The Firm. ""I didn't really see any evidence of any kind of follow-up,"" she said. ""Then abruptly, they just cut all contact with me without any notice or explanation."" She said duress alarms had been installed in the area where the alleged assault occurred after she had stopped working there. Luna has now taken action against her former employer in the South Australian Employment Tribunal, challenging her dismissal as well as a raft of other work conditions. The Firm strongly contests her allegations; saying a SafeWork SA investigation found it was compliant with relevant legislation. It said it has ""considerable measures"" in place to protect performers, including ""security staff, CCTV, duress alarms and a strict 'no touching' policy"". Luna said The Firm's ""no touch"" policy played into dancers' vulnerability and was common at strip clubs in the state given South Australia's laws criminalising sex work. The laws mean any sexual touching between a client and a stripper is a criminal offence and risks the club's license to operate. Rather than protecting dancers, Luna said it fostered a culture of secrecy around sexual violence in many South Australian adult entertainment venues. ""I've known of instances where a dancer was strangled in a dance and she was more afraid to leave the dance and seek assistance from the manager, than to stay and just attempt conflict resolution,"" she said of an incident at another club. ""We will actually be punished for it because we've then put the club's license at risk."" The Firm disputes this, saying ""the claim that performers are blamed for the sexual misconduct of a patron or denied shifts for raising concerns are untrue"". ""Any complaint involving sexual misconduct is taken seriously,"" The Firm said in a statement. ""Generally, the performer and patron involved will be interviewed and the available CCTV reviewed … a patron may be asked to leave the venue, or SA Police called."" Luna also wants to change the wider industry. In her tribunal claim, she alleges The Firm wielded strict control over its dancers, enforced by withholding pay from dancers if they broke rules, known as ""fines"". She said the practice is widespread in South Australian strip clubs. ""Common fines that we would see in the industry, would be if we're late, if we don't roster on to a shift that the club would like us to roster on to,"" she said. ""If we're sick too many times in a given period, if we don't have the correct uniform."" Former stripper Violet* agreed the industry practice of fines were unreasonable and demoralising. ""There's fines that range from $20 to $1,000 plus, depending on the severity of what you've done, determined by the club,"" Violet said. ""There are some clubs that try and fine dancers for being on their phones on the floor. ""If you have a doctor's note, if you don't provide it within a time frame, you'll get a fine. ""The biggest fine that I've ever seen was $1,000 if the club fires you for some reason, you can pay that money to come back and work. ""There's been nights where I've gone home in the negative, if it's a quiet night, but I still can't go home, I'm still expected to stay there at the shift time set by the club, despite being an independent contractor."" The Firm said it ""rejected"" that ""performers are fined more than they earn"". ""Where amounts are deducted from a performer's remuneration, then this is because the performer has breached her contractual obligations or polices (sic) designed for the legal, safe and orderly operation of the venue,"" it stated. Luna said despite being engaged as contractors, she believed strippers were treated as employees. Nicola Spurrier told a parliamentary committee last year the criminalisation of sex work had created barriers to accessing health care. ""The clubs want the best of both: they want to be able to dictate when we work and how we work,"" she said. ""But then they also don't want to be liable for us in any way, they don't want to be responsible for our tax, our super, our injuries."" Last year, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) ruled The Firm had engaged Luna as an employee, not a contractor, and ordered it back pay her superannuation. The Firm has since paid her back. In a statement, it said ""the issue of mandated superannuation for independent contractors is before the Federal Court"", and that where the ATO found a contractor was mandated superannuation, it would follow the law. Now, Luna wants the tribunal to also find she was an employee, to set a precedent for other strippers, and help them claim other employee entitlements like workplace insurance. Aaron Connor from the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance union said given the strict rules, dancers should be paid as employees under an award, not treated as contractors. ""It certainly looks like what we would call sham contracting,"" he said. ""It's not sufficient to be able to just say that you're a contractor and then that's what it is, it's how you undertake that work."" He said the concern was similar to those experienced by workers in the gig economy, like ride-share workers and others in newer, emerging industries. ""They don't have control over the way that they work, in terms of you know, when they dance, when they don't, what they can do and not do,"" he said. ""They all indicate very much that they're employees."" The Firm takes a different view, saying dancers are contractors because they ""work on dates and times they choose"". ""Where a performer agrees to work on a date and time, then it is expected that she will attend and remain at the venue for the rostered period. ""Performers are well remunerated and able to earn substantially more than they would as a part time or causal (sic) employee,"" it said. ""The Firm does not believe that classifying performers as employees would enhance their remuneration, nor would this be an accurate classification of the contractual relationship."" Discussing the industry generally, Violet who has worked at several clubs, said historical stigma around stripping as well as a relatively young, feminised workforce combined to disempower dancers. ""One of my favourite quotes from a manager is 'a new girl turns 18 every day',"" she said. ""They're coming into this industry, being moulded by the club they're working at, not being told anything about the nature of their employment."" She said the practice of only paying cash, and not offering invoices to strippers affected their ability to access loans and interact with the tax system. ""It's so hard to get loans for houses,"" she said. ""I would like to buy a house one day, but I can't prove my income. ""We've asked for invoices, they've refused."" Luna and Violet have created an online hub, the South Australia Stripper Hub, to connect dancers and help them understand their rights. Johnston Withers Lawyers' Emma Thornton, who is representing Luna, said in many ways that was an important step to improve work conditions. ""Some of the recent cases that are coming out of the High Court are in fact, adverse to employees and making it more difficult for people to establish that they're in fact full-time workers,"" she said. ""I think campaigning, raising issues like this and joining unions, is the best way to address more systemic problems with that power imbalance that happens between employees and employers."" Luna said if clubs will not engage them as employees, they should instead allow dancers to truly work as contractors. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory.

""Strippers there are at liberty to offer dances that have a certain amount of more interpersonal contact or physical contact, but under no circumstances do they have to,"" she said. ""There's different sort of pricing structures, different types of exchanges and it's negotiated person to person, it's not negotiated with the club. ""What the stripper would earn, it's all theirs they don't split that commission with the club. ""They actually operate independent of the club, they pay a fee to basically rent the space and so then pay a fee to rent the space and have sort of the right to conduct their business in that environment."" A bill to decriminalise sex work is before the South Australian parliament — the 14th attempt in the state's history. Luna's case in the SA Employment Tribunal will be heard this week. *Luna and Violet are the names both women used in their work.

159,Tara wants to keep her fashion label's clothes out of landfill. Here's how she's doing it,arts-culture,"  Selling old clothes is a $175 billion industry. Now brands that make the garments want a cut Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog In the postmodern world of fashion, there is a well-worn saying that everything old is new again, as brands recycle past trends for the latest generation. At fashion brand Assembly Label, this concept is quite literally true. It's selling the same garments twice. The Australian fashion chain's chief executive Lee Thompson describes its program Reworn as a ""a product take-back initiative"". ""The purpose of it is to extend the life cycle of Assembly Label clothes,"" he says. The scheme is launching in the chain's 16 stores nationally from this month. Reworn encourages people to bring back clothes that they've bought off the label previously and aren't wearing anymore. The incentive for them to do this is 10 per cent off their next purchase instore. Assembly Label then re-sells the old clothes and keeps the cash. It has already trialled this scheme at one of its Melbourne stores, where it got back 750 items from customers and re-sold them in less than a month. Downstairs at its Fitzroy store it continued to sell men's and women's clothing in its signature muted colours, with prices ranging from around $50 upwards. Upstairs, it was re-selling items that had already been worn by customers, for around half their usual price. ""So it completely sold out, which was definitely overwhelming,"" Thompson says. On a smaller scale in regional South Australia, another boutique is getting into this trend too. Tara Rowe is also getting her customers to bring back clothes they've bought off her anytime since her shop, Call Me The Breeze, opened in 2014. Instead of offering a discount, the Port Lincoln boutique is giving people who bring back their old fashion an actual voucher for the store. They get back 25 per cent of their old item's original purchase price. ""So if someone bought from us a $200 dress within the last eight years since we've been open, and they have proof of purchase, they can return it for a $50 gift voucher,"" Rowe says. ""It's just trying to make it easier for people to sell the items that they have sitting in their wardrobe that are gathering dust, and someone else might love them and give them a new home."" No longer associated with mothballs and op shops, second-hand clothing has grown into a major global industry worth $175 billion annually, according to analytics company Business of Fashion. There's less data on how much it's worth specifically here in Australia, but anecdotally, second-hand clothing is becoming a significant part of the fashion industry, as shoppers seek out bargains and sustainability. Much of the growth here so far has come from second-hand stores. There's now several chains across Australia that let people wander in off the street with their unwanted clothes and sell them instore on a consignment model. Goodbyes is one of those chains. It now has five shops nationally. ""Items are held at our service locations on consignment for seven weeks instore. When an item sells, proceeds are split between Goodbyes and the seller,"" Goodbyes director Monique Thomas says. “Since opening, we’ve seen considerable disruption and growth in the resale and second-hand industry. Seven years on, there are more options than ever for people to shop and sell second-hand.” Australians are also selling a lot of their old clothes online using third-party websites. ""eBay has been around since the dawn of the consumer internet,"" fashion industry re-sale expert Amelia Crook says. ""But we're seeing more and more that there's specialised fashion, second-hand websites popping up."" These include Depop, AirRobe and Vestiare, the latter of which Gucci's owner Kering took a 5 per cent stake in last year. The amount that these websites take off sellers in commission or fees varies. There's also a lot of old clothing being sold organically on social media, including Facebook and Instagram. Again, there's little data on exactly how much in Australia. Through her company Ownershift, Amelia Crook is helping brands realise just how much of their product is being re-sold in the secondary market at any given time. ""We recently did a snapshot for a brand that everybody would know. And there was over $2 million worth of items in circulation across eBay, Facebook marketplace, AirRobe and others,"" Crook says. ""There is value on the table for brands to enter this market. ""We've seen the Boston Consulting Group say that about 25 per cent of wardrobes are going to be second-hand in the next few years. And that means if brands aren't involved in the second-hand business, they're going to lose their customers."" Enter the idea of brands re-selling their own clothes. ""Second-hand is a huge growing market,"" Call Me The Breeze's Tara Rowe says. ""And if we don't do something different about the way that we're selling clothes now, then we're going to sort of miss the boat."" The companies that are starting to get into the re-sale space are hoping customers will bring them back their old clothing because it's easier than re-selling it themselves. As anybody who has ever tried to re-sell items on Facebook may attest, it sometimes feels half worth it after you've cleaned the item, listed it, and then haggled with 40 different people over its price. ""I think there's a real benefit of just being able to walk into the store that you bought (an item) from and return it, and you get a gift voucher and you don't have to deal with any of the selling process,"" Rowe says. The vouchers and discount codes also come with an added benefit for the company, because it helps brand loyalty and keeps customers returning back instore. Selling second-hand also opens up their brand to a different market. ""I think it will open up new doors for us in the sense that we might take on new customers who previously maybe couldn't afford a $300 dress or a $400 dress at our store,"" Rowe says. However, Call Me The Breeze is still figuring out how to make this all profitable. At this stage, Rowe just wants to break even on the scheme, and says it's more about ensuring they take responsibility for the products they sell. ""We felt that we needed (to) create a business model that keeps our clothes in the loop and out of landfill,"" she says. ""It has always been important to us to be a sustainable boutique."" While the brand is technically getting their own items back for free to re-sell, Assembly Label's Lee Thompson also says they don't think Reworn will be hugely profitable anytime soon. That's because it's selling it's own items the second time around at a significant discount of 50 per cent from the original price. It's also spending time and money cleaning, repairing and re-listing these items. It's also partnering with a recycler, where it is sending all the clothing that it gets back, that is too damaged to re-sell through Reworn. ""We'll break even,"" Thompson says. ""Selling recycled clothes is nothing new. It's existed for a very long time. ""For us, it's just making sure that this is an alternative way for people to be able to do it, and take control of the life cycle of our own products."" Both of the brands do sell mid-tier, less trend based fashion. This may give them more of an edge in re-sale than cheaper fast fashion labels, where the value of a new item can drop as quickly as the latest style goes out of fashion. This trend is more advanced globally, especially in the United States. There, fashion sustainability advocates the Ellen MacArthur Foundation have voiced concerns that the trend may not end up sustainable if it just fuels more consumption. ""These models do not always lead to environmental benefits, particularly, if they are seen purely as 'add-ons' to a traditional wasteful model as opposed to central to all business activities,"" one of the foundation's reports summarised. ""For example, incentivising product take-back for resale, remaking or recycling by offering vouchers for new products may fuel more production."" Goodbyes' director Monique Thomas also shares these concerns, when the take-back programs are being run by mass market fast fashion brands. ""Recycling or resale schemes attached to businesses that produce high volumes of low quality can start to feel a bit murky,"" she says. Monash Sustainable Development Institute's fashion sustainability expert Aleasha McCallion believes what's happening so far in Australia is worth encouraging. ""The potential downside is encouraging people to just buy more stuff,"" she says. ""But the opportunity is to learn about valuing clothing and taking care of what we have, and we're being reminded that we can actually re-sell it."" McCallion says if brands can figure out how to make this space profitable, it will create a naturally self-sufficient model where items don't end up in landfill or unworn. ""Brands have spent a lot of time developing beautiful products and putting them into the market. What's wrong with wanting to sell them more than once?"" she says. ""We have mainstream resale in lots of other settings. So we always think about reselling our cars, or maybe reselling tools. ""I think it's great to see brands realising that their product can be resold a few times.""

161,How a shark attack survivor inspired a portrait in one of Australia's premier art prizes,arts-culture,"  Percivals' prestigious portrait prize unveils some famous faces in Townsville Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian Navy diver Paul de Gelder was taking part in a counter-terrorism exercise in Sydney Harbour in 2009 when he was mauled by a bull shark and came perilously close to death. He lost two limbs in the attack but in the years since has become an unlikely global advocate for shark and marine conservation. His story struck a chord with Queensland artist and free diver Carla Benzie, who reached out to de Gelder to paint his portrait. ""What inspires me about him is that he was attacked by a bull shark but now dedicates his whole life to conservation, awareness and education to save the sharks that almost killed him,"" she said. Her painting, entitled Lighting Up Change, took her about 300 hours to complete and has been selected for The Percivals — north Queensland's premier art prize. ""I was stoked … it was a very awesome moment,"" the self-taught artist said. ""I want [the painting] to bring attention to the fact that in Australia, we have the Great Barrier Reef — one of the most fantastic ecosystems in the world — but we aren't doing anything to protect it."" The biennial art competition is one of the largest regional portrait prizes in Australia. This year, 127 paintings and 76 photographic portraits were shortlisted for The Percivals, which opened at Townsville's Perc Tucker Regional Gallery this weekend. Sydney artist Michael Lindeman took home the top honour, winning the main $40,000 painting prize for his self-portrait, simply entitled, I … The $10,000 photographic prize was awarded to David Cossini for his portrait of teenage twin brothers at the Summernats car festival in Canberra. Shortlisting judge Stephen Naylor said this year's show featured a ""mixed bag"" of high-profile artists and amateurs, with a good representation of local talent and ""unpolished gems"". ""The diversity is what really caught my attention when I looked at the range of works,"" Professor Naylor said. ""A great portrait is what's left behind when the sitter gets out of the chair."" The exhibition features plenty of well-known faces, including country music star Troy Cassar-Daley, boxer Jeff Horn, actor John Howard, federal politician Linda Burney and comedian Melissa Ritchie. Unsurprisingly, many of the other selected artworks reflect experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cairns-based photographer Brian Cassey travelled to the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah in October 2021 during an urgent door-to-door vaccination drive. ""There was a lot of negativity about being vaccinated in Yarrabah because of a lot of very untrue stories going around social media,"" Mr Cassey said. It was there he met and photographed 67-year-old Leanne Bulmer, who received her first vaccination on her front verandah. ""The local Indigenous health service had organised this ice cream van to follow the doctors and the medical teams around Yarrabah, handing free ice creams to the children and those who were vaccinated if they wanted them,"" Mr Cassey said. ""It really made it like a carnival atmosphere. ""I raced up the stairs and Leanne was sitting on her bed in the living room with an ice cream … and I just took a few frames."" City of Townsville councillor Ann-Maree Greaney said The Percivals helped put the city ""on the map"" as the arts capital of northern Australia. She said it was heartening to have the opportunity to celebrate the arts again after two years of COVID challenges. ""Two years ago, I was standing there announcing the winners via video, so it's lovely to be able to open the gallery doors to the public to say, 'Come in and view this wonderful exhibition',"" she said. The Percivals will be on show at the Perc Tucker Regional Gallery until July 3.

162,"After a life on stage, choreographer Gary Lang's body may be broken but his mind is still creating",arts-culture,"  Darwin choreographer Gary Lang clocks 20 years of teaching dance in the Northern Territory Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog After decades performing as a dancer on stages around the world, Gary Lang's body has caught up. At 60, the choreographer moves with a slight hobble around his inner-city Darwin rehearsal room where he teaches his craft every week. ""The dancing body is broken but this isn't,"" Mr Lang said, pointing to his head. ""I have my scars from dance, but this is still creating."" For 20 years, the artistic director of NT Dance Company has taken his stories of living in Australia's frontier to the stage. ""I create dance on dancers and non-dancers, and I make them look beautiful,"" he said. ""It's like pulling it out, little bit by little bit — sometimes it's a bit of a shock to them but it's about trust."" Mr Lang has traversed the world as a dancer, and taught at some of Australia's top dance companies, including Bangarra Dance Theatre in the 1990s. When he turned 40, caring responsibilities brought him back to his hometown of Darwin. He said the time was right to ""rest his soul"" and start his own company. ""When I came back to Darwin, it just felt like I stepped back and was where I was meant to be,"" he said. ""I could bring that knowledge back."" But starting a dance production company from scratch didn't come easy. It's only now, after two decades in the business, that Mr Lang is drawing a proper wage. It's a love story that has paid off. Using homegrown dancers, his company has been involved in several major collaborations, including the 2018 production 'Milky Way' with the West Australian Ballet. Mr Lang credits the world he travelled for shaping his art and said his inspiration as a choreographer comes from his backyard. ""Being a Larrakia man, working and living on my own country – I belong, I really belong [because of] the fact that this is my country, he said. ""It really helps with my artistry of choreographing, of creating."" Mr Lang was raised by his mother Inez in the Darwin seaside suburb of Nightcliff in the 1960s, with his grandparents living around the corner. As an only child, he remembers the ""smells of the area"" as a kid. It was a blend of sea air, frangipani flowers and the aroma of his grandfather's blachan filtering down Aralia Street. ""You could smell it down the street and people used to come and say 'Dalph, Dalph, are you cooking blachan, can we have some?"" Mr Lang said. His late mother was his biggest role model. Mr Lang remembers dancing around the kitchen table with her as a child listening to Nat King Cole, and the day she put the hard word on him when he finished school. ""After high school, my mum said 'you need a job Gary',"" he said. ""I wasn't going to be a labourer, as in doing plumbing or carpentry, that sort of thing, look at me, so I ended up doing hairdressing."" After finishing his hairdressing apprenticeship, Mr Lang felt a ""greater force"" telling him to leave Darwin and take up dancing down south. He booked a one-way ticket to study dance at NAISDA [dance college] in Sydney and spent two decades performing around the world, leaning on his hairdressing skills in between productions to get by. Mr Lang said he has faced many ups and downs as a dancer and credits his mother for showing him how to be resilient. Inez was a survivor of domestic violence, which Mr Lang said she ""never showed"" and did all she could to make him happy growing up. ""I watched my mother go through hell and back,"" he said. ""Watching the resilience of this woman, coming from a broken marriage, how she just kept everything together … that's what keeps me going."" Mr Lang's family on his mother's side hails from Darwin's large Cubillo family – a Territory surname synonymous with sport and athleticism. As a teenager growing up, Mr Lang enjoyed going to Gardens Oval to watch his cousins play AFL. But he said the grandstand became harder to bear when he came out as a gay man in the early 1980s. ""I used to go to the football with my cousins and go and sit down in the grandstand and I go and get called 'faggot' and 'poofter',"" Mr Lang said. ""I look up and there's all these people laughing at me and I think 'that's ok, measure for measure, what you do to me will come back to you.'"" Mr Lang's experience of coming out in a small town is still raw but he said it's made him stronger. ""That's one of the hardest things, being a gay man growing up in Darwin, especially then because I come from a family of sports people and I'm twinkle toes on the world stage,"" he said. Being back in Darwin helping the next generation of dancers grow and flourish is now his biggest motivation. To his dancers, he's honest about the industry and what to expect, and leverages off his own experiences growing up to make them stronger. ""My advice to anybody is not to stop and don't give up,"" Mr Lang said. ""Once you know who you are, and you have the support as a soul, you just grow … you will get people who will pull you down, but you just have to keep going.""

He recently drove from his home on the Dampier Peninsula to Sydney to pursue his dream of acting. This year's recipient of the prestigious Balnaves Foundation Scholarship to attend the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), Mr Howard received $90,000 and a six-month paid internship after he finishes his studies. ""I didn't believe it, this young fella from the bush all the way in Sydney,"" he said. It took Mr Howard and a friend four days to drive from the Kimberley to Sydney. ""I went to boarding school for years so I'm used to being away from home, but this is the furthest I've been and the longest I'll be away for."" He became interested in acting when he was in high school after doing an assignment on a film based in Sydney. Even though his teacher at the time encouraged him to pursue acting and film, Mr Howard said he still felt pressure to put his efforts into sports. ""Growing up, you get told that you're gonna be the best footy player or basketball player."" It was not until he completed a year at WAAPA in Aboriginal performance, that Mr Howard knew he wanted to pursue acting more seriously. ""It was an intense course, but after that year I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I want to be an actor."" He says he still gets homesick but reminds himself to be grateful about the opportunity he has received. ""I have thoughts of sitting by a fire on the beach at home, but there's a bigger and better reason that I'm here. ""It's all a big dream come true."" Mr Howard's studies will take the better part of three years and he hopes to enrol in a masters degree after that. ""I want to be able to tell not just my story, but other Indigenous artists' stories and our stories as a collective around Australia.""

164,"John Russell, last surviving member of original Mawson Station Antarctica team, dies aged 101",arts-culture,"  Antarctica's 1954 Mawson Station team final surviving member John Russell dies aged 101 Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The last living member of the 10-man team that built Australia's Mawson Station in 1954 has passed away in Brisbane, aged 101. A legend of Australia's Antarctic exploration history, John Russell sailed to the icy southern waters on the MV Kista Dan to construct the first permanent structures that became Mawson Station 68 years ago. Located about 5,200km south-west of Perth, Mawson Station is the longest continually operating facility south of the Antarctic Circle. As a young English diesel fitter and engineer fascinated with the ice-floes and wintry weather of the far south, Mr Russell came to Australia hoping to join the country's growing involvement in Antarctica. ""I came here in 1938 to join an Antarctic expedition, because I had decided when I was 10 years of age that that was what I was going to do,"" he told ABC Radio Brisbane in February last year. World War II, however, put Mr Russell's dreams on hold. He enlisted to fight for his adopted homeland of Australia but was later discharged after weeks of serious illness in Alice Springs. Fully recovered, and with his original division already overseas, Mr Russell signed up to relieve the crew of British troop carrier Aquitana, spending weeks working in the ship's engine room. After his maritime career ended, Mr Russell returned to Australia and joined the civilian construction group sent to rebuild a shattered Darwin after the bombing in 1942. It was known as the Darwin Overland Mobile Force. But as Australia slowly recovered from war and turned its attention once more to the south, his Antarctic dream remained very much alive. Sir Douglas Mawson had been championing for an Australian commitment to invest in Antarctica and, in 1947, the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) was launched Mr Russell's opportunity came when he was appointed engineer for ANARE and a telegram summoned him to Melbourne. Mr Russell travelled to Macquarie Island in the winter of 1949, Heard Island in 1952, and then began work on the project to build Mawson Station in 1953. His role was challenging — modifying equipment and machinery so the team could work in Antarctica's freezing conditions. Working in Melbourne, the team sourced and developed pre-fabricated buildings that could be quickly put together on-site to form what would become Mawson Station. The team set sail on the MV Kista Dan in 1953 and by February 1954 arrived in Horseshoe Bay. ""The only place we could find which looked possible from aerial photographs for this particular base, [was] with a fairly narrow entrance into [Horseshoe Bay],' Mr Russell told the ABC last year. ""Around the bay were little bare-nosed rocks sticking out, and one big rock shelving down from the ice. ""The plateau ice flowed each side of this rock down into the sea. ""That's where we built the base and it's still there today."" He said the team had to work fast, with the ship staying put for 10 days, by which time they had built the kitchen, living area and two store huts. By the end of 1954, after months of work, the 10 men had built a living quarters, works hut, engine shed, store huts and a carpenter's shop. Biscoe Hut, the eight square metre original living and sleeping quarters Mr Russell's team built, still stands today. After the Mawson Station expedition concluded, Mr Russell returned to Antarctica in 1958 with Americans at McMurdo Station —  his last trip south before settling into married life with his wife Joan and daughter Sue. Through his long and varied career, he worked for BP, ran a banana plantation, and lived in Singapore before eventually settling in Brisbane. Mr Russell outlived all of his 1954 Mawson Station expedition peers and later collaborated on a book about his experiences. In January, shortly before moving into respite care from his Deception Bay home of many years, Mr Russell donated to the ANARE club his collection of journals, papers, photos and technical drawings, which dated back to 1948. His daughter, Sue, said Mr Russell passed away peacefully on Monday night — two months shy of his 102nd birthday. As per his wishes, his body has been donated to science, after living a ""full and remarkable life"". Mr Russell is survived by his daughter Sue, his two stepsons Douglas and wife Chris, and David and his partner, Sue's husband Keith, six grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.

165,"Lured away from the bright lights of big cities, astrotourists head to regional communities ",arts-culture,"  Astrophotography lures tourists to regional towns, away from big city lights Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A rising interest in astrophotography across Australia has led to the creation of a booming tourism industry for isolated regional towns. John Sarkissian from the CSIRO Parkes Observatory said stargazing had become an integral part of the economy for rural hamlets away from the city lights in the New South Wales Central West. ""We are quite fortunate here in Australia because the centre of our galaxy passes directly overhead, so we get to see the richest, most interesting parts,"" he said. ""In the Northern Hemisphere it is just scraping the horizon. They miss the glories of the sky so they travel here."" Mr Sarkissian said the bright lights of metropolitan cities made regional towns the ideal location for astrotourism. ""If you want to take a picture of the beautiful night sky with the Milky Way you have to do it from the country,"" he said. ""If you are standing at the south pylon of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, then good luck. Here's how to shoot the night sky and get a stellar picture out of it. ""City folk, when they come out west, are totally amazed by the number of stars. It is not just a few scattered here or there; the whole sky is aglow with the Milky Way."" Bathurst-based amateur astrophotographer Rodney Watters said more people were travelling to regions like the Central West to take advantage of the conditions. ""Astrotourism is definitely an expanding business, there is no doubt about that,"" he said. ""It has become a good way to boost our local tourism industry, to introduce people to the Central West and provide another avenue for them to explore the countryside."" Mr Watters said the increased interest in night photography had resulted in tourism operators creating 'dark sky sites' where strict rules on lighting were put in place to create ideal conditions for seeing the Milky Way. In the early 2000s, DSLR cameras often cost in excess of $5,000. Consumers can now purchase a digital camera for less than $1,000. The President of the Central West Astronomical Society, Tim Anderson, said the price reduction had contributed to the boom in participation. ""We have definitely seen more people getting involved,"" he said. ""The cost of getting into the hobby has come down so far and the quality of the instruments that you can buy is so much better than it was even 15 or 20 years ago. ""It has created a golden generation of astrophotographers."" Mr Anderson said this had translated into a 25 per cent increase in members at the Parkes-based society over the past four years. Mr Sarkissian said the developments in technology allowed anyone to get into astrophotography. ""Everyone now has a smartphone and the cameras on those are as good as anything that was around 10 years ago — it amazes me how good they actually are,"" he said. ""So no-one has any excuse now saying, 'Oh, I didn't have a camera'. ""Everyone has a phone, so you can go out and take a picture of the galaxy.""

166,'Most advanced place in the territory': New NT recording studio hits right note for music industry ,arts-culture,"  New community music recording studio in Palmerston first of its kind in the NT Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog We've all seen music videos of bands jamming out in the studio, packed with microphones, instruments and recording equipment. But it's not often you get the chance to go inside one yourself. A new recording studio in Palmerston, south of Darwin, will help upcoming musicians, and professionals, record their work. The studio, located at the public library, was officially opened by the City of Palmerston earlier this month, and has been named Gulwa which means 'sing to everyone' in Larrakia, in collaboration with Larrkia Nation. ""This is the first of its kind in the Northern Territory,"" Palmerston Mayor Athina Pascoe-Bell said. ""We've got a lot of very talented people in the community, so this gives them an opportunity to make their own recordings and get themselves known."" The City of Palmerston said the studio is fully equipped to be used for audio and visual recording, mixing and post-production, and broadcasting. Danny Christie is a local audio engineer and will be on deck to help artists out in the studio. He said it's been designed as an industry-standard space. ""This is probably the most advanced place in the Territory to do any kind of recording,"" he said. The council said the studio would be available for individual or group hire as well as for industry and would offer a cheaper rate for individuals and not-for-profits. Mr Christie said ensuring the studio is accessible to locals artists was important. ""There's a lot of really talented young people out there who don't have access to something like this, and now they do,"" he said. City of Palmerston said it hoped the studio would give the community a chance to make their mark. ""Engaging young people in lots of different kinds of recording projects, as well as the broader community,""  the council's general manager of community and culture Anna Ingram said. Crystal Robins is a Darwin-based musician and said the studio would help make the recording process easier. ""We always had to bring everything in, set it up, pack it down at the end,"" she said. So it's great to have a purpose-built space here."" Mr Christie said the studio didn't just make setting up to record easier, but also helped set artists up in the industry. ""A lot of local talent will fly to Melbourne or go to Sydney, and that's not really something we should encourage,"" he said. ""We should keep them here and build them here, then get them to go there, to the big city."" Mr Christie said young artists were already getting excited about being able to use the studio. ""We had a couple of beat-makers in just checking out the space, who were really excited,"" he said. ""... a 13-year-old-kid who was like, this is amazing I can't wait to get in here."" Mayor Pascoe-Bell said it was important to nurture talent in the community. ""It's important for cohesive communities, that art and culture is a very dominant theme,"" he said. A community open day will be held at the studio on Saturday.

170,Films capture true essence of people with dementia so their stories travel with them,arts-culture,"  How filmmaker's mum inspired Moving Story project to help people with dementia Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A project giving people with dementia ""a chance to be film stars"" is providing Tasmanian aged care teams with insights about their clients that no amount of paperwork could ever convey. The Moving Story project is inspired by filmmaker Chris Mead's own experiences and that of his mother, Judy, who developed dementia and needed to move into residential aged care in her later years. An interim report from the University of Tasmania shows research into the project has found the five-minute documentary films, co-produced with the dementia patients' families, provide a personal insight that clinical notes simply cannot. ""Really, this all began with the day of my mother's funeral,"" Mr Mead said. ""She had dementia and was in residential aged care for many years. Some carers came to her funeral and, at a funeral, you tell lots of stories. ""So carers came up to me and said, 'We just didn't know some of those things about your mum'. ""I didn't really expect them to know, but it triggered the thought: would it have made a difference to her care if they did know?"" Assisted by Munnew Day Centre in Devonport and Arts Tasmania, Mr Mead's Arts Health Agency is creating films with people transitioning from home care through Munnew into full-time care. The films draw on a person's life story, attitudes, loves, losses and passions. Often the co-productions are led by family and also involve Munnew carers. The hope is that the story travels with you. ""We're just exploring the idea, hoping it can improve the care someone receives,"" Mr Mead said. ""There are life stories in these films, sure, but there are also nuances of personality and attitude. ""And there are carers and family and where they're at. They struggle too and they matter just as much. ""They're so brave when they talk about going into aged care — or about being the person left at home. It's a really hard thing to talk about. ""This is what the aged care commission is recommending as well — that clients, families, and the care teams all be stakeholders in this."" Munnew team leader Tammy Bromfield says the people they meet through their dementia-specific program are finding their voice through Moving Story. ""These films have led to some incredible conversations we've all been able to have together,"" Ms Bromfield said. ""Someone like Ted [Hicks], we've learnt how important music is to him. He plays every chance he gets and at our fortnightly cafe events. ""They are often chuffed that they have had a film made about them. It's a rock-star moment. ""People need to know that someone is listening, someone wants to know, and somebody cares. ""The films have been quite emotional for families but, in turn for my staff, we've all shed a tear."" Mr Mead said he would always remember how disempowered he felt when his mother moved into aged care. ""Mum said that 'the boxes just keep getting smaller', and then you're shown her second-last box. ""It's a small room and you just don't feel you have the agency to speak up. You want to be part of the solution."" Many people who have participated in the Moving Story project — and other programs Agency and Munnew have collaborated on over many years — discover new talents and interests. Marj Fitzgerald discovered the joy of dance when she spontaneously took to the stage for a video shoot for young musician Ella J, part of the Arts Health Agency's Soul Connection project bringing young and old creatives together. ""[Marj] has two daughters and, like me, they cried when they saw the end product. I had never seen her dance in that way really ever,"" Marj's husband, Chris Lacey, said. ""It's a very emotional thing for family. It's been a joy to get emotional and not hide it."" A presentation about the Moving Story project at the National Elder Abuse Conference in Hobart generated much interest in the experimental work. It is funded until June and the university research will also be finalised. The future is uncertain after that, but Mr Mead said he was looking for potential partnerships and stakeholders to help it continue. ""Mum always felt invisible, as a widow and a pensioner,"" he said, approaching her memorial plaque at the Emu Valley Rhododendron Garden. ""With her dementia, she would try to articulate what it felt like and she would just say, 'Take me down the backyard and shoot me with a popgun'. ""The quote that's on her plaque directs this work; it says, 'Rejoice in the infinite beauty of this moment of now.'""

171,How one music teacher 'lit the spark' for Golden Guitar winner,arts-culture,"  Tamworth Golden Guitar Award thrills bush balladeer Angus Gill, who pays tribute to music teacher Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It's been a dream of Angus Gill's since he can remember, and now the Mid North Coast singer-songwriter and producer can call himself a Golden Guitar winner. ""I was just speechless. I couldn't believe it,"" he said of his glittering  Tamworth Country Music Festival moment. ""It means so much to me 17 years later to pick up a Golden Guitar. We don't do it for that, we don't do it for the awards."" His song, The Easy Way, co-written with friend Manfred Vijars, was named Bush Ballad of the Year at country music's night of nights. Gill was also nominated for three other awards and, among the celebrations, he found time to thank one person in particular. ""My first teacher William Lane and his wife, Coral Lane — Bill lit the spark in me and [I'll] always be indebted to you for that. This one's for you Bill."" A Wauchope local and retired country music teacher, Mr Lane remembers the talent he saw when he gifted a seven-year-old Angus Gill a second-hand Fender guitar. ""I knew with confidence that he was one day going to win a Golden Guitar,"" he said. ""I was absolutely over the moon. I'm so proud of that boy."" Mr Lane dedicated his time to teaching Gill and other young musicians after his own music career was cut short. While on stage with music legend Jimmy Little, Mr Lane collapsed due to a medical condition. ""Once they found out someone collapsed on stage, they'd be very wary about hiring you,"" he said. So, aged just 28, he was forced to retire. ""It was the hardest thing for me to decide to do ... that's when I started teaching people."" Gill was recognised at the Tamworth Country Music Festival for his latest album, The Scrapbook, which he worked on throughout the COVID-19 lockdowns. Late last year the album climbed to number one on the ARIA country charts, yet another achievement ticked off for the young musician. These triumphs have made Mr Lane extremely proud following his own loss. ""I wanted to be up there, I wanted to win awards — that gap is now completely closed with Angus winning a Golden Guitar, because I've done it to help other people,"" he said. Gill said he was thankful to his old music teacher. ""Thinking about Bill and what he's done for me over the years. ""He really lit the fire in me.""

174,Here's how Netflix's crackdown on password sharing and switch to ads might work,arts-culture,"  How Netflix could introduce advertising and a crackdown on account sharing Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The value of Netflix is falling as the company contends with subscribers leaving the streaming giant in droves. In less than four months, the company's share price has dropped two-thirds, from its peak at the end of 2021. It suffered a plunge of 35.1 per cent on Wednesday alone, its largest one-day fall in more than a decade. With tough times seemingly ahead, Netflix has flagged possible changes to its product. These changes could have a massive impact on customers, especially those who love the product the way it is. The art of sharing passwords for streaming services has been enjoyed for years. Netflix has allowed accounts to have multiple profiles but has not put an end to different households using the same account. It estimates there are around 100 million households globally that watch Netflix but do not pay for it. This appears to be over, with the streaming giant currently trialling a new payment system where those who have accounts used across multiple households will pay more. That trial is being conducted in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru. Members of a standard or premium account will be allowed to add sub-accounts for up to two people who live in separate households. This will cost roughly an extra $US3 ($4) per month. Netflix said the act of different households sharing the same account with no additional fee was hampering their business. ""While [separate profiles and multiple streams] have been hugely popular, they have also created some confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared,"" Chengyi Long, director of product innovation said in March. ""As a result, accounts are being shared between households — impacting our ability to invest in great new TV and films for our members."" ""We've been working on ways to enable members who share outside their household to do so easily and securely, while also paying a bit more."" Netflix has not announced any time frame for when these changes could be rolled out across the globe, meaning household account sharing is safe in Australia for now. A major drawcard for Netflix since it became a steaming service was its lack of advertising. Netflix has hinted it will start cracking down on password sharing after posting an unexpected drop in subscribers. However, this looks like it could change in the near future. Chief executive Reed Hastings told investors during a conference call on Tuesday that the company had been considering introducing a plan where customers could pay less, but have advertisements. ""Those who have followed Netflix know that I have been against the complexity of advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,"" he said. ""But, as much as I am a fan of that, I am a bigger fan of consumer choice. And allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price, and are advertising-tolerant, get what they want, makes a lot of sense."" Mr Reed told investors that this option could become a reality within the next two years. When asked if Netflix would consider trialling ads in some markets before rolling it out globally, Mr Reed said there was effectively no need for that. ""I think it's pretty clear that it's working for Hulu. Disney is doing it. HBO did it,"" he said. ""I don't think we have a lot of doubt that it works, that all those companies have figured it out."" Not yet. It has kept its cards close to its chest about how a plan with advertising would look for its customers. However, it could follow a similar plan to some of its competitors, such as HBO, Disney and Hulu, which were all mentioned during Tuesday's investor meeting. Customers of HBO Max will see ads at various points while on the streaming service. ""You'll see ads before and during select shows and movies,"" its website states. ""The ads you see will vary, depending on the show you're watching, and whether or not your profile has parental controls."" Hulu also shows advertisements in the middle of programs. Netflix has seen its value fall dramatically over the past few months. The investor pull-out comes off the back of Netflix announcing 200,000 subscribers had left their service in the first quarter of 2022. It will get worse for Netflix, with an estimated loss of 2 million subscribers from April to June. The removal of Netflix in Russia in response to the war in Ukraine was given as a reason for the exodus. Netflix's value sits at around $US100 billion, well down from its height of around $US300 billion in 2021. It is also suffering from a saturated, competitive market.

175,Restoration of WWII-era gun reveals 'explosive' link to infamous air raids,arts-culture,"  Machine gun believed linked to WWII Japanese air raids on display in Broome museum Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An amateur historian has told of the moment two men unwittingly pulled a World War II machine gun from the depths of the Broome coast while out on a fishing trip. Dion Marinis has carefully restored the Colt MG40, which he believed had been submerged in the ocean for 80 years, and returned it to the Broome Historical Museum this week. Mr Marinis said the gun came into his hands ""a few years back"" when two fishermen pulled anchor off the local port. ""[While pulling, the fisher] thought, 'This is hard', and eventually the anchor came up,"" he said. ""But on that anchor was the machine gun, the Colt machine gun."" The two men placed their unusual find — then encrusted in weed after spending years on the ocean floor — in an esky of salt water and brought it to the local museum where Mr Marinis later picked it up for restoration. An examination of the gun revealed its history, steeped in the 1942 air raids on Broome. Mr Marinis said it was his belief the gun had broken off one of the early Catalinas – flying boats used by the Dutch that were destroyed when the Japanese attacked Roebuck Bay. ""This machine gun was basically submerged on March 3, 1942,"" he said. In the years since, tourists have been able to view the Catalina wrecks at low tides. Among the gun's quirks are bullets that were still inside, including an exploded cartridge which Mr Marinis believes came apart when the Catalina was under attack. ""I believe that it's highly a possibility that [the gun] was firing back at the Japanese Zeros during the air raid,"" he said. Further investigation also showed the gun was left-handed and its bullets had been manufactured in a factory in Footscray. Working with a friend, Mr Marinis went through the lengthy process of reverse electrolysis that neutralises corrosion and stops the metal from rusting and breaking apart. He also used a crystalline wax to seal the gun and preserve it, as well as restore its serial number and neutralise the bullets inside. Mr Marinis said all the work made it ""emotional"" to return the gun to the museum. ""They all tell a story … and I think it's important for the legacy of the [air raids] to go on. ""I'm just an ordinary guy who decided to do a reverse electrolysis on an artefact … anyone can do anything if they really want, and [if you want] to be part of the museum, I encourage you to come down.""

176,Slim's record broken as Golden Guitar Awards mark 50 years,arts-culture,"  2022 Golden Guitar Awards see Cassar-Daley take out Slim Dusty record, Shane Nicholson and Ashleigh Dallas collect top gongs Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Records have been broken at the 2022 Golden Guitars in Tamworth, with 17 awards presented for the event's 50th anniversary year. Troy Cassar-Daley was named Male Artist of the Year and his album The World Today took out Top Selling Album of the Year. Meanwhile South, his duet single with Ian Moss, was named Vocal Collaboration of the Year. It has brought his record number of Golden Guitars to 40, surpassing Slim Dusty's and Lee Kernaghan's 38 awards. ""I've never counted Golden Guitars until I've heard that,"" he said. ""I remember having a conversation with Slim years ago about making sure you grow as an artist — even if you're in country music, you need to continue to grow. ""I can't believe that Slim, myself, Lee are all on the same thing. It's very weird."" Cassar-Daley also paid credit to his manager, Chris O'Hearn. ""This fella encouraged me to get counselling two months ago and it's the best thing I've done in five years,"" Cassar-Daley said. ""Good friends will do that."" The collaboration on South also meant Ian Moss collected his first Golden Guitar award. ""Unfortunately, Ian Moss couldn't be here tonight,"" Mr O'Hearn said. ""I'm sure he would like to thank his manager, so I'd like to thank me."" Although Cassar-Daley was nominated for eight awards on Wednesday night, it was Shane Nicholson who took out the most. The Brisbane singer-songwriter collected four out of five Golden Guitars, including Album of the Year and Alt Country Album of the Year for Living in Colour, plus Song of the Year and Single of the Year for And You Will Have Your Way. Ashleigh Dallas, who calls Tamworth home, took out Female Artist of the Year and Video of the Year for Long Way 'Round. Group or Duo of the Year went to the Wolfe Brothers, while their album Kids on Cassette took out Contemporary Country Album of the Year. Hosts Beccy Cole and Adam Harvey also entertained the crowd with some cheeky banter. ""I'm sorry Beccy, I've yet to say anything to compliment you,"" Harvey said in reference to Cole's costume. ""We have the same black curtains on our windows at home."" ""Thank you very much,"" Cole shot back. ""But I bet your windows aren't wearing suck-your-guts-in underpants."" Cole was honoured the 2022 inductee into the Australasian Country Music Roll of Renown, joining names such as Kasey Chambers and John Williamson. Other awards included: Awards were presented to artists, albums and songs released between October 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021, despite the ceremony's postponement from January. Thousands arrived in the country music capital to be wowed by the week's festivities. On Tuesday night, Tamworth's main park was filled to watch 29-year-old Carrington musician Max Jackson crowned as this year's Star Maker. Jackson won above nine other singer-songwriters and will now be supported until the next festival to follow a country music career. ""My heart is overflowing,"" she told the crowd. ""I'm just a little girl from Coonamble who sat in the front row of so many of the previous Star Maker concerts, looked up and thought, one day I want to be like them."" Along with awards, the Country Music Festival has also continued tradition by celebrating legends in the industry. A bronze statue of John Williamson was unveiled Wednesday morning, surrounded by the city's iconic Hands of Fame, where six music figures were added to the list. Luke O’Shea, Kirsty Lee Akers, Lyn Bowtell, Roo Arcus, Dennis 'Fibber' Parker, and John Elliott have joined 300 others in country music history. The Tamworth Country Music Festival will continue until the weekend, where performances will stretch from pubs to clubs across the city. At this stage, the 2023 Golden Guitar ceremony has been scheduled to return on its regular January date.

177,Groovin the Moo cancels drug-testing at Canberra music festival after insurers pull out,arts-culture,"  Groovin the Moo cancels pill-testing at Canberra musical festival after insurers pull out Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Canberra's biggest music festival will not provide a testing service for illicit drugs after insurers backed out just days before the event. Groovin the Moo, to be held this Sunday, was the first event in Australia to provide free testing of pills to festival-goers. Both organisers and the ACT government support the controversial service, which allows people to check whether their drugs contain dangerous substances without exposing themselves to law enforcement. However, Pill Testing Australia, which carries out the checks, says it could not lock in public liability insurance for this weekend. The organisation previously provided testing at the 2018 and 2019 Canberra festivals. Its spokesman, Gino Vambuca, said he was devastated to receive the news just days before the event. ""It's sad and quite dangerous in a way that you'd pull this rug out from underneath us now, because whether you like it or not we know what happens — some people will use drugs,"" he said. Mr Vambuca said multiple private insurance brokers had demanded extra information and imposed unfeasible deadlines. ""They've declined at the last minute to proceed with insuring us, and requiring a heap of other information that was impossible to provide them with at such short notice, effectively terminating our service."" He said that, since the pandemic began, insurers regarded live events as higher risk, which had an flow-on effects for health services like his. ""Somehow, they're thinking it'll be a safer festival if … we're not there, which flies in the face of the evidence that's actually there."" Mr Vambuca said other harm-prevention services would likely face similar insurance problems in future. ""This is a real problem over the horizon: any service that engages with people who use drugs, even though they're reducing harm or treating them, is going to find insurance increasingly difficult to obtain, and that's going to be problematic,"" he said. The New South Wales and federal governments both oppose pill-testing, despite inquiries recommending it as a way to reduce drug-related deaths. The federal government has banned the service at another Canberra music festival, Spilt Milk, which is held near the city on Commonwealth land. But while Groovin the Moo has ACT government backing to test pills, Mr Vambuca said insurance brokers were now effectively deciding on the service's future. In a statement, a spokeswoman from the Insurance Council of Australia said the ""risk appetite for insurers"" was currently ""low"". ""Right now, insurance globally is in what is known as a ""hard market"", which means the risk appetite for insurers is low,"" she said. ""Activities of these sorts, which are inherently risky, may be less appealing to insurers in this environment."" Thousands of people are expected at this weekend's Groovin the Moo, which is returning after a two-year pandemic hiatus. Pill Testing Australia said it had prepared for the event by rostering more than 40 volunteer staff, including health professionals.

179,Australian artists launch global art auction to raise money for Ukrainian refugees,arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Andrei Vigovsky, 45, is preparing to take up arms to fight for his country. The reserve officer has been in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv since the war in the country began, spending each night taking shelter in a subway station underground. His sister, Olena Vigovska, who immigrated to Australia 26 years ago, has watched helplessly from afar as the has war unfolded. ""It's a feeling like, 'What are you going to do?'"" she told 7.30. ""It's unbelievable. I'm still pinching myself every morning."" Catch up on all the news about the Russian invasion of Ukraine In the second week of the war, Ms Vigovska and three other Ukrainian Australian artists began putting together an auction to raise money for refugees in their homeland. ""We jumped on that project with pleasure,"" she said. ""I feel much better now. I can use my skills to raise money and show the world how art can be so important and helpful in wartime."" Her painting of three bold sunflowers is one of four artworks being sold next month, with the proceeds going to Habitat for Humanity. ""It will be a lot of work to rebuild Ukraine,"" she said. ""In Kharkiv … the number of apartment buildings which [have been] completely ruined is 2,000. ""It's just awful to see. ""I hope we will be able to make a difference."" The project's organiser, Tetiana Koldunenko, told 7.30 the stress of the war had taken a huge toll on her and her family. ""My auntie Raisa was living on the fourth floor of her apartment block,"" she said. ""She couldn't go to the bomb shelter because of her knee problem and asthma. ""There was no water, no heating, the windows were broken and it was -12 [degrees Celsius] outside, so she was probably thinking, 'Will I freeze to death today or tomorrow?'"" Over 12 days, and with the help of her local MP, Ms Koldunenko's 85-year-old aunt made the difficult journey from Kharkiv to Sydney. ""When I see all these people who want to leave, I really feel that they do need to leave … we need to save their lives in any possible way,"" Ms Koldunenko said. She said focusing her energy on creating art for the auction revived her and gave her some hope for the future. Ms Koldunenko said she wanted her painting of two butterflies in the colours of the Ukrainian flag to represent the transformation Ukraine was undergoing. ""The butterfly is a symbol of change from the caterpillar — you change to something beautiful,"" she said. ""I'm absolutely sure that Ukraine will be beautiful. It will have a beautiful future.""

180,Here's why people are ditching Netflix and what it means for you,arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Netflix has suffered its first subscriber losses in more than a decade, with a 26 per cent tumble erasing about $US40 billion off its stock market value. The company said it had lost 200,000 subscribers in its first quarter, falling well short of its forecast of adding 2.5 million subscribers. Suspending service in Russia after the Ukraine invasion, alone, has resulted in the loss of 700,000 paying customers. Netflix has acknowledged its problems are deep-rooted, projecting a loss of another 2 million subscribers during the April-June period. If the stock drop extends into Wednesday's regular trading session, Netflix shares will have lost more than half of their value so far this year, wiping out about $US150 billion in shareholder wealth in less than four months. The news deepens troubles that have been mounting for the streaming since a surge of sign-ups from a captive audience during the pandemic began to slow. It marks the fourth time in the past five quarters that Netflix's subscriber growth has fallen below the gains of the previous year. Now investors fear that the Netflix streaming service may be mired in a malaise that has been magnified by stiffening competition from well-funded rivals, such as Apple and Walt Disney. The setback follows the company's addition of 18.2 million subscribers in 2021, its weakest annual growth since 2016. That contrasted with an increase of 36 million subscribers during 2020, when people were corralled at home and starved for entertainment, which Netflix was able to quickly and easily provide with its stockpile of original programming. Netflix estimated that about 100 million households worldwide were watching its service for free by using the account of a friend or another family member, including 30 million in the US and Canada. ""Account-sharing as a percentage of our paying membership hasn't changed much over the years, but, coupled with the first factor, means it's harder to grow membership in many markets — an issue that was obscured by our COVID growth,"" Netflix said in a letter to its shareholders. With the pandemic easing, people have been finding other things to do, and other video-streaming services are working hard to lure new viewers with their own award-winning programming. Apple, for instance, held the exclusive streaming rights to CODA, which eclipsed Netflix's Power of The Dog, among other movies, to win Best Picture at last month's Academy Awards. Escalating inflation over the past year has also squeezed household budgets, leading more consumers to rein in their spending on discretionary items. Despite that pressure, Netflix recently raised its prices in the US, where it has its greatest household penetration and where it's had the most trouble finding more subscribers. In the most recent quarter, Netflix lost 640,000 subscribers in the US and Canada, prompting management to point out that most of its future growth will come in international markets. Netflix has signalled it will likely crackdown on the sharing of subscriber passwords that have enabled multiple households to access its service from a single account. And, for the first time, Netflix said it was open to the idea of offering lower-priced subscriptions with advertising. ""Those who have followed Netflix know that I've been against the complexity of advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,"" the company's chief executive, Reed Hastings, said. ""But, as much as I'm a fan of that, I'm a bigger fan of consumer choice."" Mr Hastings said ""it's pretty clear"" that ad-supported services were working for Disney and HBO. This confluence of events caught Wall Street by surprise. ""They suffered from a combination of approaching saturation, inflation, higher pricing, the war in Ukraine and competition,"" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. ""I don't think any of us expected that all to happen at once."" The world's dominant streaming service was expected to report slowing growth, amid intense competition from established rivals such as Amazon.com, traditional media companies such as Walt Disney and the newly formed Warner Bros Discovery and cash-flush newcomers such as Apple. Streaming services spent $US50 billion on new content last year, in a bid to attract or retain subscribers, according to researcher Ampere Analysis. That's a 50 per cent increase from 2019, when many of the newer streaming services launched, signalling the quick escalation of the so-called ""streaming wars"".

181,Cloudy phenomenon makes its mark as air travel booms,arts-culture,"  Weather expert says cooler temperatures help create vapour trail phenomenon in NSW, as air travel booms Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The boom in air travel over the Easter holiday week has had a unique consequence for regional NSW, with residents in the state's north west reporting a dramatic increase in vapour trails filling horizons. Also known as 'contrails', some people have photographed up to 10 at a time over Armidale, Tamworth, and the Liverpool Plains. Weatherwatch director Don White said the phenomenon was caused by planes flying at high altitudes during cooler weather. He said, above 8,000 metres, temperatures over the region dropped to below minus 30 degrees Celsius. ""[Vapour trails] are formed in the upper atmosphere, caused by the hot air from the plane creating ice crystals and water droplets creating a visible trail,"" he said. There has been a boom in air travel due to Easter and COVID restrictions easing, and Mr White said aircraft travelling between major cities was the main cause of vapour trails because they had the highest flight paths over regional NSW. ""You don't get them near the airport,"" he said. ""Melbourne to Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, or even Sydney to Sunshine Coast follow a circle over the Northern Tablelands and Tamworth region at maximum height. ""What's also made a difference in the past week is the rain in eastern Australia. The upper atmosphere is quite moist at the moment."" Although this week proved to have the perfect conditions for maximum vapour trails, Mr White said the sight would be short-lived. ""There will be fewer of them around after this week, as the upper atmosphere becomes more stable. But there'll be periods over winter where it will have more moisture,"" he said. ""It will now fluctuate. There have been some weeks where there are virtually none around, and some weeks where there are quite a few."" The spectacle had locals in the region sharing their vapour trail snaps on social media. One Tamworth community weather Facebook page attracted more than 120 comments with locals sharing their experiences. But on top of the photographic opportunity, Mr White said vapour trails could also help predict the weather. ""If they break up fairly quickly and disappear, the upper atmosphere is quite stable,"" he said. ""If they persist for longer, you can check the direction of movement. ""If they expand a little bit, there's a little bit of instability in the atmosphere and that usually indicates there's the potential for rain around.""

182,'I was devastated': Sour note as noise complaints threaten to silence Queensland music venue,arts-culture,"  Live music in Maleny Lane on the Sunshine Coast may be silenced by noise complaints Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A popular music venue at Maleny could be silenced following ""several noise complaints"" made to the local council. Maleny Lane has become a mecca for food lovers, with nine international food stalls. And throughout the pandemic, seasoned performers and aspiring artists have been adding their own flavour to the mix. The lane, on the town's main street, hosts standalone acts on Friday nights and an open-mic style event on Mondays. But the venue has received a legal letter from Sunshine Coast Council, demanding it cease all live music by May 6. On Monday, hundreds of supporters surrounded the venue with banners and instruments to demand the music play on. Steve McLeish organises the Monday event at the venue, known as The FrontUp Chalkboard. ""They've given us three choices: stop music altogether, take it somewhere else, or put in a development application,"" Mr McLeish said. ""We don't fit any of their boxes. ""The music was ancillary to the food court, but the popularity of the Maleny Lane and the music there has sort of expanded over the last year so we've expanded beyond their 'box' of market. ""So the next leap is to go to a nightclub licence, which is totally not what we are. We run two nights a week, from 6 o'clock till 9 o'clock – no alcohol. ""So we don't fit the nightclub licence but we've expanded beyond the market licence."" He said two local barristers had volunteered their services to assist the community with its campaign. Choir singer Mandy Lupton has started a petition to save the venue, which has attracted more than 3,000 signatures in 48 hours. ""I was devastated because I've been to nearly every one of the Chalkboard nights, which is where artists get up and just have 10 or 15 minutes each,"" she said. ""And I've been to a few of the Friday nights as well, where one band or artist plays for the whole night. ""I'm really passionate about the venue because it's a showcase for emerging and established artists."" Ms Lupton said opportunities for artists had been limited in recent years because of COVID. ""So this has enabled those artists to perform and hone their craft and develop their skills,"" she said. Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Sunshine Coast's weekly email newsletter ""But also, it's an avenue for the community to come together, listen to the music and just engage. ""It's a whole positive social inclusion venue.""

183,Lindsay and Paula Fox make record $100 million donation to Melbourne gallery,arts-culture,"  Lindsay and Paula Fox donate $100 million to new NGV Contemporary art gallery in Melbourne Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Billionaire trucking magnates Lindsay and Paula Fox have made a record $100 million donation towards The National Gallery of Victoria, and secured naming rights on the gallery's new building in the process. It is the largest cash donation ever made to an Australian art museum by a living donor. The new building will be named The Fox: NGV Contemporary. The Victorian government on Tuesday said it hoped the move would encourage ""further philanthropic support for the project"", with the donation building on the existing $20 million donated by the Ian Potter Foundation in 2020. To put the donation into perspective, Forbes estimates Mr Fox’s net worth as $2.9 billion. The Fox family is behind Australia's biggest private logistics company Linfox, which has more than 5,000 trucks across 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific. The new gallery will be built in the Melbourne Arts Precinct at Southbank. Minister for Creative Industries Danny Pearson said the donation was an ""extraordinary gift to the people of Victoria."" ""Philanthropy can transform cities and NGV Contemporary will be a true game-changer,"" he said. The new gallery forms part of the $1.7 billion redevelopment of the Southbank precinct, the Melbourne Arts Precinct Transformation, which also includes upgrades to the Arts Centre Melbourne, as well as Arts Centre Melbourne's new Centre for Creativity. The planned precinct will showcase art, design and fashion as well as national and international architecture, and will feature an 18,000 square metre public space. It has been labelled as Melbourne's answer to the Eiffel Tower. Ms Fox, who is also an NGV board member, said the gift was ""the culmination of many years of passionate support"" for the gallery. ""We hope that our donation will inspire others in supporting this program to make this an icon for the future,"" she said in a statement. The new site in Southbank is expected to be finished in 2028. The arts industry was particularly heavily impacted by COVID-19 restrictions that saw thousands of artists and performers thrown out of work as shows and galleries closed.

184,Domestic violence survivor brings a 'fire in her belly' to Australia's first Women's Trauma Recovery Centre meeting,arts-culture,"  Women's Trauma Recovery Centre founders meet following federal budget's $25-million pledge Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When domestic violence survivor Mel Edwards left her abusive relationship, she could not believe the additional trauma she experienced trying to get help. ""There were so many gaps where I had to try and navigate alone and try and figure things out,"" she said. ""There was a lot of victim blaming and there was this overall sense of 'shut up and put up, this is how it is [and] you just have to work within what is available'. ""That really stoked a fire in my belly."" Ms Edwards is part of a group working to build Australia's first Women's Trauma Recovery Centre in the Illawarra region. A fortnight ago the project was promised $25 million in the federal budget. In a rapid response, the team supporting the project, including the Illawarra Women's Health Centre (IWHC), victim survivors, lawyers, architects, social workers, clinical health workers, researchers and welfare advocates, held its first establishment meeting. Ms Edwards is also studying to be a social worker and said the meeting at the University of Wollongong on Thursday filled her with hope and determination. ""Certainly, there is a sense of safety around being able to contribute and knowing that all voices at the table are heard,"" she said. ""I want to be able to say this space has been safe enough to me and I have the support that I need to feel strong enough to be able to say what I need to say."" IWHC chairwoman Judy Daunt said it was incredible to sit down with the contributors, advisors and consultants and move forward after a three-year campaign. ""We want everybody to see we have the right people,"" she said. ""We have a really clear vision, we have a set of underlying guiding principles, and we have a very clear picture of next steps. ""We've got legal advice, architectural co-design advice, our research and evidence frameworks and an ethics plan."" Survivors of domestic violence are a step closer to accessing holistic support to recover from trauma, but aged care workers say the federal budget is a ""missed opportunity"" for improving conditions. Ms Daunt said they were still working to secure funding for land and capital. ""We have identified a couple of options and we are now putting some really clear information for the state government."" Violet Co Legal and Consulting director and principal solicitor Karen Iles was helping to establish a governance structure for the centre. ""Women who experience trauma related to intimate partner violence are likely to experience complex legal needs,"" Ms Iles said. A sexual assault survivor herself, Ms Iles said issues involving housing, tenancy, Centrelink and health could all become interlinked when trauma was at play. ""So much is all jammed in together, so just having that ability to unpick those things at the same time and doing it promptly will lessen the ongoing trauma,"" she said. ""The longer that you hold onto all the administrative stuff that goes with it, the longer it takes to heal, and I have been in that position myself, so I get it."" She said the centre would provide women with an opportunity to understand all their options. ""Then they can make a choice of what they want to pursue and what justice looks like and, although justice is not the same as healing, it can go some way."" University of Technology School of Architecture lecturer Samantha Donnelly was also part of the first meeting and is helping to develop a trauma-informed design for the centre. She was prepared to work on redesigning an existing building or create a new build on a greenfield site. ""The building and landscape are important in helping the recovery process [by] having an outlook and giving people who are using the building a sense of safety, privacy and dignity,"" Ms Donnelly said. ""You want to create safety without it looking like a prison, and having access to outdoor space always provides you with a sense that you know where you are in the world."" This included understanding what ""trigger points"" needed to be considered while designing the building, along with the materials and spaces that would ""create a sense of calm and safety"". ""The building has the responsibility to deliver the knowledge that has formed the idea of a trauma centre, so it is beyond exhilarating to put it into a physical form,"" Ms Donnelly said.

187,Courtney found this old camera with a roll of film still in it. She got the photos developed ,arts-culture,"  Courtney found an old camera with a roll of film still in it, so she got it developed Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Courtney Hart was browsing for knick-knacks in her local op shop when she came across an old camera sitting on a shelf. It was a model people used to call a ""box Brownie"", because the early models were, quite literally, in the form of a cardboard box. It was a valuable find for a photography buff like Courtney, who started experimenting with old-school film cameras during Victoria's COVID-19 lockdowns. ""I saw this camera and I thought, 'That's really cool,' and my mum told me how my grandmother used to have one,"" she said. Courtney wasn't sure whether the camera was worth the $20 price tag, but when her mother opened the back of it, she knew she had to buy it. There was a roll of film in it. ""I was just thinking, 'Wow, if there's film in there I really want to see what's on it, I wonder if I'll be able to get any photos from it, I wonder if it's going to be able to be developed,'"" she said. Courtney took the film to a film laboratory in Geelong without much hope — the film must've been sitting in the camera for decades. Would it still be OK? Courtney's camera is a Kodak Brownie Six-20 Model D. It's old and obsolete, but holds a pretty unique place in photography history. Kodak released the first Brownie model in 1900, and it revolutionised photography, giving virtually anyone the means to take photos for a relatively low cost. They were also quite small and portable, making them ideal to take on holidays. Many soldiers in World War I and World War II also took them overseas as they were small enough to fit in a soldier's pack. Some of the most iconic war photographs from the Western Front were taken with a Kodak Brownie, as well as photographs of the actual iceberg that sank the Titanic. The Six-20 Model D was sold between 1946 and 1957, but the specific face plate design on Courtney's camera was only a feature on models up to 1953. Some photography enthusiasts still use the Six-20 Model D, but film is extremely hard to come by and the resulting photos are not quite up to the standard people have come to expect. Courtney's camera could be 70 years old, but of course the film roll itself could be much newer. The laboratory that Courtney took her film to told her that particular camera film was available between 1939 and the late 1950s. That news did not fill her with hope. Courtney was sitting at her desk at work when an email came through from the photo laboratory with six images attached. The first two were just dark smudges, but the rest were not only clear, they had people in them too. Identifiable faces. ""I was just like, 'Oh my gosh there are photos here, there are people in it.' I was just so amazed,"" she said. The photos are of a bunch of blokes clearly having a good time — shirts and shoes are clearly optional, but beer and cigarettes are plentiful. They prompted more questions than they answered for Courtney. ""What was happening in these photos? Who are these people?"" she said. Courtney has now set herself the task of answering those questions, posting the images on Facebook groups across the country in the hope that someone might recognise the men or the gathering. ""A lot of people said it could be up in Darwin, some people said PNG or Vietnam, but I'm not sure if it's war-related,"" she said. ""I looked up some photos from the Vietnam War and I noticed there were some similarities but I'm just not sure about the timing."" The setting is clearly tropical, but several of the men also have full beards, which was not generally allowed in the military. One thing that's clear is that photos were definitely not taken in Geelong, but somehow that's where they ended up. Courtney says she'll keep trying to solve that mystery herself. ""I really just want to try and reunite these photos with their family, I think it's really special.""

190,"Sam the blind donkey's story could have been a sad one — instead, he's inspiring kids everywhere",arts-culture,"  Sunshine Coast's blind donkey inspires kids' book, raising funds for Happily Heifer After Sanctuary Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As Mavis Armstrong sat on the front steps of her Tin Can Bay home, listening to the natter of the holidaying children, the girls started ""chirping"" about electric fences. She was instantly curious. ""They sort of looked a little bit not farm-type kids, and I'm thinking, 'How do you know about electric fences?' So I asked,"" Mrs Armstrong, a former cattle farmer, said. ""And [one girl] starts the story, 'Oh, we go and see Sam the blind donkey', and [says] how much they like Sam, and I didn't get much more of the story than that."" The children left their holiday house the next day and returned to the Sunshine Coast. But Mrs Armstrong couldn't get those four words — Sam the blind donkey — out of her mind. So the 75-year-old did what she'd done a handful of other times in the past year when animals resonated with her — she jumped out of bed and started writing. Part-way through the process, she felt a little overwhelmed, so the book sat on the shelf for some time. ""I've never drawn in my life until last year and suddenly I'm trying to draw things and it terrifies me,"" she said. Eventually she took to the pages once again, and upon finishing the story she shared the tale of Sam the blind donkey with a neighbour's child — a move which led to meeting Sam in real life. The neighbour recognised Sam from an ABC story during the February floods and showed the online story to the ""not very tech savvy"" Mrs Armstrong, who successfully tracked down the donkey at a sanctuary on the Sunshine Coast. ""He really did exist ... and I was able to ascertain that yes, Sam was totally and completely blind,"" she said. Sam has been at the Happily Heifer After Sanctuary for about 18 months. ""He was used in television and movie production and then he also worked at a theme park for a while so the stressful aspects of what he did were actually what led him to be blind,"" sanctuary co-founder Michelle Dranfield said. ""He was put into escalators and lifts, he was put into a convertible ... a lot of different, really strange things that he did when he was acting as a stunt animal."" She said animal welfare regulations had become tougher since then. After Sam was ""discarded"" from the entertainment industry, an older couple cared for him for nearly 15 years until he was moved to the Palmview sanctuary. He arrived there with his ""seeing companion"" donkey and best friend, Jack. ""Once he's been in an enclosure for probably about a couple of days, he kind of knows that enclosure,"" Ms Dranfield said. ""He'll bump into maybe something a few times then ... he'll just navigate his way based on his memory of the area. ""Jack is quite good at helping him navigate."" Sam, a ""loving, placid, docile and trusting"" donkey, is part of the sanctuary's animal assisted therapy program. ""Particularly people with physical disabilities can probably relate more to him than they can a fully abled animal because they see the struggles that he has to deal with and it kind of relates to their struggles on a day-to-day basis,"" Ms Dranfield said. ""The fact that he can overcome those struggles and still be so content and so happy and so loved by everyone I think is quite reassuring to those people."" Ms Dranfield was not surprised that Sam resonated with the local children so much that they went on to share his story with Mrs Armstrong. ""I think he really, really connects with people because of his personality and because of his nature, so it was incredible to hear the story and hear how it came about,"" she said. While Mrs Armstrong wrote her story before she knew Sam's real-life story, the two are extremely similar. ""The story of Sam is to demonstrate that even with adversity, there are many positives each day,"" she said. ""In the book I tell the story about his everyday life, how anyone or any creature would live with blindness, because we've still got the blessings of being cared for. ""Not seeing the sun but feeling the warmth of the rays, smelling the rain without being able to watch the clouds, appreciating the fact that he can hear the farmer bring his feed every day."" The book also incorporates the friendship of the ""true and caring"" Jack, a young boy who visits Sam. Mrs Armstrong has agreed to have the book printed as a fundraiser for the sanctuary. ""I sort of saw it as a means of helping them ... to raise much-needed cash to buy all the hay and all the feed and all the care that the animals need,"" she said. ""I thought if they were agreeable, they were welcome to my story."" ABC Sunshine Coast will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday. Sign up to stay connected.

192,"A stroke robbed Barry of his speech, his memory and his gift with a brush. Here’s how he fought to get it all back",arts-culture,"  Indigenous artist Barry Johnny fights back after stroke to start painting again Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog In the remote Aboriginal community of Doomadgee, in north-west Queensland, you'd be hard-pressed to find an artist as well respected as Barry Johnny. Just three years ago, Mr Johnny was enjoying a successful career with hundreds of his vibrant landscape and animal paintings exhibited and sold around the country. But that all changed overnight At 54, Mr Johnny suffered a stroke and was flown to Townsville for lifesaving treatment. He woke up in the hospital with significant memory loss and broken speech. Dazed and confused, this was the beginning of Mr Johnny's long road to recovery. ""When I returned home, I didn't paint because I couldn't remember a lot of the animals' names I'd painted – goanna, crocodile, barramundi – and I couldn't remember people's names,"" he said. After returning to Doomadgee, Mr Johnny sought comfort in the craft he loved. With the help of NDIS support provider My Pathway, he began to inch toward improvement. ""When I was in Townsville, in hospital, I wanted to do paintings. I didn't know a lot of things, I'd forgotten,"" Mr Johnny said. ""I don't know how I ended up like this. I get upset sometimes. I was a free man. ""But [when I started painting again] it helped with my memory, remembering how to draw the birds and the serpents."" Although he found solace in his art, a grief-stricken and defeated Mr Johnny became detached and reclusive from the world around him. ""He wasn't mixing with his community. He just stayed home. It was his safe place,"" disability support worker Lee Brown said. He is the program coordinator for My Pathway which runs services out of its Doomadgee facility. A team of workers there are helping Mr Johnny, and others like him, get back on their feet. The First Nations artist has been receiving speech therapy via telehealth sessions with North West Community Rehab, assisted by James Cook University students in Mount Isa. And they all agree that it's his art that gets him talking. ""At each session, Barry brings in a different painting so they can talk about it. These sessions are really making a difference. Barry loves talking about all his paintings,"" Mr Brown said. ""He has about 40 on the go in his room at the moment. It's a great way to make him think about all his artwork and it encourages him to use his words. ""Talking about what colour combinations go together and about all the shapes and techniques he uses helps with repairing the connections in his brain damaged by the stroke,"" Mr Brown said. ""Now Barry's starting to remember more about his country and community, we can see he's so much happier."" Mr Brown helped to convert a shed at the My Pathway facility into an art space for Mr Johnny who wakes up each morning with a special place to go to. Through his art, Mr Johnny is developing relationships with other people at the facility. ""I drink coffee and chat with everyone. I'm so happy to be around everybody. I have a lot of respect for them, and they have a lot of respect for me,"" Mr Johnny said. ""He likes to have a yarn to all the guys welding and doing carpentry in our Pathway shed,"" Mr Brown said. ""The welders are making vases at the moment, so they've asked Barry and another participant, Beau, to paint them."" Mr Johnny's artwork tells a story of his journey, Mr Brown said. ""If you lay his artwork out you can see the improvement, he has been practising and practising. It's like a visual timeline of his recovery,"" Mr Brown said. ""We've taken people who have visited already and heard about his artwork up to his house before, and he's laid all his artwork out under the mango tree and talked about it to them and sold pieces there."" Three years on from his stroke, Mr Johnny is preparing for a Cape York art exhibition he will feature in later this year. ""It would just be another step in his recovery to follow his artwork up to western Cape York, just to be involved in the actual exhibition, and be able to talk about his art,"" Mr Brown said. He's been helping Mr Johnny get his car roadworthy in preparation for the return of his licence. ""I'll see the doctor soon to find out whether I can get my licence back. It would feel good to have that independence again. I am hopeful,"" Mr Johnny said. ""I'll get in my car and my dog will be in the front, and my kitten will be in the back, and we will go wherever we want to,"" he said.

193,The first 'MasterChef' wasn't televised — and it celebrated overlooked women,arts-culture,"  More than just MasterChef: a brief history of Australian cookery competitions Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australians were involved in competitive cookery long before MasterChef. The earliest of Australia's cooking competitions were at agricultural shows. In 1910, the Royal Agricultural Society of NSW hosted its first competition for ""perishable foods"" at the Royal Easter Show. Along with pastry and pickles, competitors could also be judged on their calf's foot jelly. By the 1920s, the cookery category at the Easter Show had been firmly established. It was purely the preserve of women. Men were prohibited from entering and wouldn't be allowed to enter until after the second world war. Women living in NSW and the ACT also entered their wares in the Country Women's Association's The Land Cookery Competition. Starting in 1949, the competition judged women on their ability to bake classics such as fruit cake, butter cake and lamingtons, offering modest prize money to the winners. It is still running today. These competitions are grounded in a history of cooking which saw women as ""cooks"" and men as ""chefs"". Women were amateurs working in the home, while men worked in professional kitchens. This phenomenon continues today. Cookery competitions allowed women to receive recognition for their often-overlooked hard work and skill. Contestants were encouraged to break out of their comfort zones, to be creative, innovate and impress. With women as their key demographic, it is little wonder that, by the 1960s, women's magazines such as the Australian Women's Weekly began hosting large-scale cookery competitions open to readers around the country. Perhaps the most extravagant of these competitions was the Butter-White Wings Bake-Off, which ran from 1963 to 1970. The competition pitted Australia's best home bakers against each other in a variety of categories, including cakes, desserts, main courses and ""busy lady recipes"". Entering their written recipes, contestants competed at state level for a chance to win a trip to the national final where they would cook for illustrious judges. Thousands competed at the state level of these competitions, and one from each state and territory would go on to the final. These were held in either Sydney or Melbourne in front of live audiences, usually in the middle of a department store. The 1970 final was televised, with the Weekly estimating two million viewers would watch the proceedings. It was Australia's first televised cooking competition. Just as MasterChef is sponsored by advertisers, the cookery competitions hosted in the Weekly proved to be lucrative marketing opportunities for a variety of sponsors. The prizes, provided by sponsors such as Breville and QANTAS, included cash, fur coats, appliances, cars and overseas holidays. The choice of judges also offers us a glimpse of the glamour associated with the competitions as well as the continued gendered expectations surrounding cookery. A slew of early ""celebrity chefs"" were flown in from exotic, international destinations to judge the competition – including the Galloping Gourmet himself, Graham Kerr. These celebrity chefs judged the main course section; the overtly feminine baking sections were judged primarily by women. It was in the cake section that contestants really went above and beyond, both in the recipes themselves and in their names. In 1968, prize-winning recipes included ""Golden Crown Dessert"", ""Marshmallow-Cherry Cake"", ""Chocolate Gold Layer Cake"" and ""Peach Kuchen"". Peach Kuchen, which won the ""Busy Lady"" section, was made with a packet of White Wings cake mix, a tin of peaches and some sour cream. The Bake-Off helped to popularise (and sell!) boxed cake mixes: even the ""busy woman"" could create delicious cakes deserving of accolades. The last Butter-White Wings Bake-Off was held in 1970, but the magazine kept hosting cooking competitions. In 1980, Elizabeth Love was crowned ""Best Cook in Australia"". It was one of Australia's most turbulent decades, but some of the themes in the 1900s are bizarrely parallel to today, writes Annabel Crabb. Her prize-winning menu included oysters in pastry cases, ballotine of duckling with baby vegetables and a red wine jus, mango sorbet and almond petits fours. In a recent interview, Love reflected that her menu drew on the concepts of nouvelle cuisine, which was popular at the time. It was an ambitious menu for a home cook – however Love declared that she didn't think it would do very well if she went on MasterChef today. Her menu demonstrates the dizzying progression of Australian food over the past 40 years. Cookery competitions like those held in the Weekly gradually disappeared, replaced instead by competitions on television, which have grown in popularity over the last two decades. Like the magazine cookery competitions of the past, where contestants were inventive and used new and exciting ingredients, television competitions have also proved important for introducing the Australian palate to innovative cooking techniques and exotic ingredients. Our ongoing fascination with cooking competition shows such as MasterChef reflects the prestige still on offer for those ambitious contestants who enter them, as well as the cultural importance of food.

195,"To the rhythm of her windscreen wipers, Joy McKean would write a history-making song",arts-culture,"  How Tamworth Country Music Festival, Golden Guitars grew from humble beginnings to be coveted gold Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As Tamworth celebrates its 50th country music festival, the late Slim Dusty still holds the record for 38 Golden Guitars, an honour he shares with musician Lee Kernaghan. But it was Slim's wife Joy McKean who won the very first Golden Guitar in 1973 for writing one of Slim's most iconic songs: Lights on the Hill. The festival's annual Golden Guitar awards are the highest accolade in Australian country music, and Lights on the Hill was written from Joy's own experience towing a heavy caravan up the then notorious Devil's Pinch near Guyra on the NSW Northern Tablelands. The trip on the New England Highway on a rainy night was made more difficult because the vehicle's headlight-dimmer switch was on the floor near the brake and Joy was restricted to the use of just one foot due to a leg caliper. ""I'd have my high beam on to see where the next turn was, a truck would come over [the hill] and I'd cop it fair in the eyes,"" she said. ""I knew if I took my foot off [the accelerator] for too long [to use the dimmer] the vehicle would either stall or start slipping back because of the weight of the van."" The song came to her in the rhythm of the windscreen wipers and by the time she reached Warwick in southern Queensland it was complete. So many country music songs are stories about life and each year the best of those are celebrated in Tamworth. Plagued by floods, drought, bushfires and most recently a pandemic, the Tamworth Country Music Festival has survived it all to reach 50 events. The festival evolved almost by accident when radio station 2TM attempted to regain some of the audience it lost to a new rival in the early 1960s. ""Suddenly, with the introduction of television, the audience evaporated at night,"" said co-founder Max Ellis. A country music show called Hoedown, hosted by John Minson, captured the most attention thanks to the station's unique frequency reach. ""2TM was part of a chain of clear channel stations down the east coast of Australia, which had been established by the government as a possible defence asset, so they would have clear communication down the coast,"" Mr Ellis said. ""In fact, we even used to get letters from listeners in New Zealand and Vanuatu and places like that,"" he recalled. Mr Ellis said artists were quick to tap into this new marketing resource. ""People like Slim and Joy were very supportive of what we were doing because, for the first time, they felt they had the support of their own media, which was recognising their ability and their talent,"" he said. In a 1998 ABC TV interview, the late Slim Dusty recalled those early days of Hoedown hosted by John Minson. ""He was that fatherly, very friendly type bloke and he'd interview truck drivers, and they'd call in and see him of a night, and he just built up a real big following,"" Slim said. Eventually, the festival grew out of a few weekend events, and an Australian Centenary concert in 1970, but there was not universal support from locals in the early days. ""Most people in Tamworth left Tamworth; they went to the coast,"" said Warwick Bennet, Tamworth Mayor from 1979 to 1986. ""It was stinking hot, you know; a few cowboys came in, the town hall was full and that was about it."" In the 1998 interview, Slim Dusty recalled a similar sentiment. ""I think all towns are the same, they just don't want their peace disturbed with a festival, but millions of dollars roll in now, so you can put up with it,"" he added. By the mid-80s, the festival was in full swing, a cavalcade had been introduced, and all roads led to Tamworth in festival month: January. ""Suddenly everywhere you went in the city there was music, people had pockets full of money to come to the festival and people got more involved with it, people didn't go away, people made money,"" Mr Bennet said. ""Right from the word go, we decided we would look for tangible aspects of country music, that we could reinforce the music part with,"" Mr Ellis said. The Roll of Renown was established in 1976, followed by the Hands of Fame Park a year later, and the Big Golden Guitar in 1988. Today the Australasian Country Music Hall of Fame holds country-music treasures that bring tourists to the city year-round. As well as being known as Mr Hoedown for his early role in establishing the festival, the late John Minson was also the craftsman credited with finessing the now-coveted Golden Guitar statue. ""The first golden guitars we got were a very rough finish, pitted and not very gold-looking at all,"" Mr Ellis said. ""He [John Minson] crafted the golden guitars out of the rough casting into the things of beauty that they are today. ""We have some research that showed back in the early 2000s something like 72 per cent of all adult Australians recognised the Golden Guitar awards in Tamworth."" Lee Kernaghan hopes 2022 will be the year that he breaks the record he shares with Slim Dusty for the most Golden Guitars. Hot on his heels is Troy Cassar-Daley with 37 of the awards. Fanny Lumsden scooped the pool at the 2021 Golden Guitars, taking home five awards to cap off a huge year, which included an ARIA award. She said the Golden Guitar awards were something special. ""It's been something I've looked up to forever,"" she said. Festival fan Kaz Johnson, who shares her birthday with the event, remembers her first country music festival as an 11-year-old in 1974. ""We always used to gather around the radio and listen to the awards while we were up there,"" Ms Johnson said. ""In those days not many fans went to the awards; it was mainly for the people who were nominated and people in the industry."" Ms Johnson has missed just four festivals in the past 50 years. She said the reaction to the event had changed in that time. ""There used to be a joke when I was growing up as a teenager, that 50,000 people would leave Tamworth and 50,000 would come in,"" she said. Ms Johnson said today's festival continued to be popular because it was so inclusive. ""That's the main attraction of Tamworth these days, anybody's welcome there no matter what kind of country music they play,"" she said. That variety is what has brought Ray Beaman back to Tamworth for the past 14 years. Mr Beaman said the artists appreciated their diehard fans and he had been gifted tickets to some concerts over the years. He said part of the attraction was checking out new talent and the future of country music. ""The younger ones [artists] are going more to country rock,"" Mr Beaman said. ""I've found a lot of it has gone more American-styled, which is not a bad thing, but I still like to keep it Australian."" While the festival was cancelled in 2021 due to COVID-19, the Golden Guitar awards were still held, allowing Tamworth to keep its industry reputation as more than just a music festival. And because of COVID, this year's festival has been rescheduled from January to April. The 2022 festival will run from April 18 to 24 with the Golden Guitar awards on Wednesday 20.

196,"The lost towns of Ballara or Hightville don't appear on maps, but these ghost settlements once drove the economy",arts-culture," ABC Rural Queensland couple's 20-year mission to protect century-old mining ruins near Cloncurry Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Gary and Wendy Baker stumbled upon an old railway line on an outback Queensland cattle station in the 1990s, they knew they were looking at something special. ""We moved here in 1995 and got lost using a map and that's how we found it,"" Mr Baker said. The Wee MacGregor rail complex and the former towns of Ballara and Hightville between Mount Isa and Cloncurry date from the early 1900s. In 1912, copper mining was booming and the Cloncurry fields produced 45 per cent of Queensland's copper production, employing about 1,400 people who lived at the sites with their families. But prices plummeted at the end of World War I and the towns — which included a police station, hotel, post office, hospital and school — and the tram and railway were abandoned by 1926. Foundations and ruins of buildings and residences were all that remained, but the Bakers knew it was important to protect as much as possible. ""A lot of mines around this part of the world were glorified camp sites, but this place was a town,"" Mr Baker said. ""There was an exploration drilling happening only about 100 metres away from the [rail] tunnel, so we immediately thought that this needs to get protection right now because it's one-of-a-kind."" After years of research and investigation by Queensland's Department of Environment and Science, Mr Baker made a presentation to the Queensland Heritage Committee in 2019. The application was to protect the site — which includes the 40-kilometre rail line, rail tunnel, a short branch tramway and the remains of Ballara and Hightville — from being disturbed. The committee reached its decision to list the site after only 10 minutes. Mr Baker said he was amazed by the speedy outcome. ""I asked how long it takes for a decision to be made and was told about two to three months,"" he said. ""So I left the meeting [and] 10 minutes later I was down at the pub having a beer when they rang me and said it was a unanimous decision, it has been passed."" According to the committee, the site ""is important in demonstrating the major role of copper mining in the Queensland economy in the early 20th century, and the importance of railways to the economic viability of remote mines"". Queensland Heritage Council deputy chair George Seymour said the tram and rail complex and what remained of Ballara and Hightville were representative of the ""very temporary nature"" of many mining towns. ""What's been left behind is important in revealing to us vital information about the construction and operation of remote mining infrastructure and the people who lived and worked in these far-flung mining operations,"" Mr Seymour said. The Bakers hope their work to preserve the site will be appreciated for generations to come. ""You see other mines in the district where you used to be able to go to and the history is gone because the sites have been so disturbed,"" Mrs Baker said. ""[The old mines] are really good examples of how the pioneer miners worked and we didn't want to see that here.""

197,'Do it for love': How a Darwin designer is cracking the international world of millinery,arts-culture,"  How a 'crafty kid' from Darwin became a global millenery maestro Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When the Northern Territory's borders shut out the world due to COVID-19, local milliner Belinda Osborne had an idea. She took inspiration from challenges experienced in that time, and imagined a headpiece that captured the beauty trapped inside her home territory. ""We weren't so much in lockdown, we were locked in, we were caged in something that's quite beautiful, Ms Osborne said. ""I wanted to put that in a piece so that whoever wears it experiences a caged feeling but in something very beautiful."" She had just five days to make the piece and get it submitted into Australia's top millinery competition, the 2021 Myer Millinery Award, in time. Putting in 12-hour days in her studio, the Darwin milliner measured and cut hundreds of intricate feathers to create a latticed headpiece that could sit on a wearer's head and confine them within. The hard work paid off. Her piece, Forever Bound, won first prize in the coveted competition, and made Ms Osborne an overnight household name in millinery circles nationally and internationally. ""Winning it was such a proud achievement for myself, it's an absolute dream for a milliner in Australia,"" she said. Her big win saw her order book quickly fill up, and from her Darwin studio she now makes special orders for clients in the UK, USA, Canada, Ireland, Singapore and Dubai. The 42-year-old credits her childhood growing up on a five-acre block on the outskirts of Darwin for inspiring her art and where she has taken it. ""Growing up with the local fauna and flora that's specific to our area really has influenced a lot of my designs,"" she said. ""I try to incorporate as much of the territory in my designs, even if you don't see it, I can see it."" Growing up as an only child, Ms Osborne's life in the bush was solitary and free. She was raised in Darwin's rural area well before the developers moved in, and when homes in Humpty Doo were few and far between. ""We could ride our bikes or our horses down the street to our friends… it was absolutely wonderful,"" she said. ""We could swim in the waterholes and not worry too much about crocodiles and things like that."" When she wasn't outdoors playing, Belinda said she was inside ""crafting"" with her mother Joan, who was known around town as ""Darwin's curtain lady."" ""I did art all the way through schooling….my mother was crafty, so I was definitely a crafty kid, I was always making something."" After finishing school, Belinda worked in fashion, studied interior design, and worked in the NT public service for almost a decade. But her passion for millinery never waned and she continued to make headwear for people, alongside caring for her young son and working full time. ""Early on, orders really only came in very close to Darwin cup time or Melbourne Cup time … so it was super intense for the four weeks leading up to both events,"" she said. When she turned 40 Ms Osborne decided to take a leap into the unknown, quitting her safe government job to take her millinery to the next level. She estimates she has made hundreds of pieces over her 15-years as a milliner, and said she ""goes into a zone"" when she is making them. ""I just go off into my little magical world of make believe in my mind and just thinking how I'm going to put this piece together,"" Ms Osborne said. Belinda Osborne said plenty of blood, sweat and tears have gone into her work and admits some pieces can be hard to part with. She said the ""strangest thing"" in her millinery career was finding out her mother Joan was also a talented milliner in Adelaide the 1950s and '60s but never told anyone. ""She said 'are you making hats and millinery?' and I said 'yes I am' and she said to me 'I was a milliner' and lo and behold we had never had that conversation before."" Belinda said her mother went on to teach her millinery techniques that were used back in the day. ""She taught me the stuff from her era … the fundamentals and principles of millinery that I like to call 'the bones of millinery.'"" Joan died just before Ms Osborne's millinery work started turning heads and was not alive to see her big win in 2021 and foray onto the world millinery stage. However, she said her mother continues to influence her designs, and even makes an appearance in her pieces every now and again. ""She was a bit of a materials hoarder, so I have quite a few of her boxes of things with me,"" she said. ""Every now and again, a hat might just need a special little item and I go and put a little bit of her in there with it and I know she'd be super proud.""

198,"Pirouettes, footy and 'doing the Aussies': How Australian ballet is busting the myths of sport and dance",arts-culture," Sport The Australian Ballet is busting myths about injuries, and helping athletes from other codes overcome theirs Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The nation's most exceptional athletes reside in football-devout Melbourne, although they don't perform in stadiums, nor do they feature on the nightly news. They're the dancers of The Australian Ballet. Measuring physical feats of repertoires against professional sports is difficult because dancers cannot wear GPS devices on stage and who else does a grand jeté en manége? Observers can only wonder. An American in Paris audiences have recently been marvelling of the performers' superior athleticism and endurance. How many sportspeople could do four shows — or games — in one weekend? Some former athletes and health professionals understand both disciplines. ""Having been on the other side of the fence, it's incredible the amount of work they put in just to get out onto the stage,"" former North Melbourne footballer Sam Wright says. As an injured player, Wright spent time rehabilitating with dancers. He has since been employed at the ballet as a welfare boss. ""My initial thought coming in here to rehab was embarrassment,"" he says. ""I thought I was working hard [in football]. ""I would say the dancers are on par, if not more professional athletes than AFL, just because of the sheer demand of what they do and what they put their bodies through."" Ballet mistress and rehabilitation specialist Megan Connelly agrees. ""They're way ahead of most because in sport you don't have the diversity of movement, and you also, in dancing, have the expectation that it's got to be pretty seamless, and you can't show the effort,"" she says. ""Footballers show their strength, and you can hear it and you can see it on their faces, and we've got to produce all sorts of movement without necessarily showing how it might feel. ""It's body, mind, and soul — it encompasses all of that and so much more, or I should say, in a very different way than sport does."" World-renowned physiotherapist, Dr Sue Mayes, has spent decades treating professional sportspeople in her directorship of artistic health at The Australian Ballet. ""I like to think of them as athletic artists. They're artists first and foremost, but they're incredible athletes,"" she says. ""They can jump higher than anyone, they spend hours working … there's no other athlete who spends as many hours training."" Most people don't realise dancers who perform in the evenings have already spent a whole day doing their exercises and often rehearsing for the next production. On long days, they can punch in for work at 9.30am and clock off at 11pm. The company performs 180 nights annually. Dr Mayes did not discount the excellence and work ethic of sportspeople. ""We do see other elite athletes in here as well,"" she says. ""They've got their own skills. Luckily these guys don't get any body contact, because I think that's a known cause of injury. Obviously, the athletes are better runners generally. ""[But] I think the dancers' precision can't be matched. Their balance, their strength through full range of movement. I bring in athletes … they are usually blown away with the hours [dancers] spend, the dedication to their injury prevention exercises, and the sorts of exercises they do before their training and also after their training. And it's quite holistic."" The Australian Ballet's training base is a modern office block behind The Arts Centre. Dr Mayes, head physiotherapist since 1997, works on the sixth-floor studios treating her dancers. When ABC Sport visited, she was helping principal dancer Joey Romancewicz with his rehabilitation. ""Bringing Joey back,"" she says. ""We'll be really closely monitoring what he's doing. Not only in each section of the day but within a class."" Romancewicz, built like an Olympic decathlete, is making a comeback from a foot injury known as Lisfranc for his lead role in Anna Karenina in Sydney. Injuries to Australian ballet dancers are rare [one anterior cruciate ligament injury in 15 years], although they were more common during pandemic lockdowns. ""That comes from doing classes at home,"" Romancewicz says. ""Jumping off tiles instead of wood sprung floors."" It's a problem that will see lingering effects. ""It has had a devastating impact on our dancers,"" Dr Mayes said of COVID. ""We'll see the impact for another year."" Dr Mayes leads a team of specialists, including Connelly, who manage athletes to prevent and minimise injury. This is where art and professional sport view performance through the same binoculars: recovery is everything. ""I'm the ballet part of the rehab,"" Connelly says. ""We have our physios, our myos [myotherapists] and our rehab physios that do the conditioning. We have a strength and conditioning person as well. My role is to bring the dancer back into the studio."" Connelly said this side of the business had excelled since she performed in the 1990s. ""I was a dancer with the company,"" she says. ""I've broken both fifth metatarsals. I've been through that process. We didn't have the same set up as we have now. We've got a whole team of people the dancers can lean on — at that stage we just had a physio."" Extra resources have coincided with more open communication. ""There was probably a reticence for dancers to report pain or to report injury,"" Connelly says. ""We had in the 90s and in the 80s that old fashioned idea of just soldier on and push through it."" Dancers used to ignore stress fractures, painful joints, and sore backs. Connelly says cultural change came under the stewardship of former artistic director David McAlister. ""We needed someone at the head who could say, hey, it's OK if there's something wrong, because we are building a team that can help you get better,"" she says. ""By that happening we were able to intervene much earlier and injuries didn't become as exacerbated. ""So that's why our [low] injury rates are just phenomenal because we have the early reporting."" The Australian Ballet also busted two big physiological myths. Twenty years ago, Dr Mayes introduced resistance training, notably calf strengthening exercise. ""Dancers traditionally spent a whole of time doing lots of stretching,"" she explains. ""We had all these calf stretches in each studios. So, we educated them years ago on not stretching and just getting the strength up. ""And that's really had an incredible impact on our injury rates. We've rarely had to operate on an ankle since. And we rarely lose dancers to availabilities — it's rare for us to have a dancer that is off."" Ballet companies all around the world have since adopted this practice, which improves muscle strength and endurance. Connelly says colleagues in the northern hemisphere pay homage to the breakthrough from Down Under. ""I know that American Ballet Theatre are doing the calf rise program, The Royal Ballet [England] are doing their calf rises,"" she says. ""One of the teachers at The Royal Ballet, when he gets to that point in classes, he says, 'OK, let's do the Aussies', and that's what they're called at The Royal Ballet. ""Lower leg, foot strength and endurance – that's what we're known for."" Then came the shake-up in hips. Four years ago, Dr Mayes, who is also an Adjunct Research Fellow at La Trobe University, published her PhD: 'Hip joint health in professional ballet dancers.' This would disprove the long-held belief that all dancers would end up with arthritic hips. ""We looked over five years to see the impact of the hip joint and we found that dancers' hips tolerated five years of really extreme loading really well,"" Dr Mayes says. ""We were also able to demonstrate that they've got strong hip muscles. It supports the concept that if you've got strong muscles around the joint, it can be protective against developing arthritis."" Dancing careers have been lengthened by this finding. ""They're leaving now without injury,"" Dr Mayes says. ""They used to leave because of injury and that's rare now."" Connelly said her boss' relatively recent breakthrough was ""going to blow everything out of the water."" ""We don't get hip injuries anymore,"" she says. ""It's really interesting, when I started doing this role [in 2009], I remember those first couple of years rehabbing hips. I remember being down in the dungeon – there's a little room at the bottom of the Sydney Opera House – and I remember being there with these beautiful, tall, open-hipped dancers, really loose, rehabbing all these hips. And I just don't do it anymore."" The hip pain associated with dancing is a sign of weakness. The Australian Ballet has introduced exercises to strengthen muscles behind the hip: hip rotators, glutes, and hamstrings. ""You can see it straight away,"" Connelly says. ""Some of the exercises, if you do them yourself – you do your adductor side lie or you do some bridging or you do a four-point-kneel deep hip rotator and you stand up. You can already feel like you're on a cloud. ""That's the beauty of the program. There's a couple of exercises that the dancers can plug in before class. In class, they don't have to think muscular skeletally, they can just move and breathe and rely on their coordination and physicality, which is what we want."" Resistance training might seem obvious for non-artistic athletes, but dance has a different history. Previously, ballet dancers were told strength workouts increased body mass. ""The dancers were really fearful,"" Dr Mayes says. ""Joey doesn't want to bulk up – because it is harder to get those movements and not jump high but what we've been able to demonstrate is with the exercises, especially the endurance ones, is that you don't get bulky. ""It's really hard to significantly change the shape of a person. And, so, we're constantly trying to reduce that fear. We've been doing it for so long, and they've recognised that our strongest dancers, our most resilient, are our best performing dancers. They've seen it for themselves."" Body image is still a constant topic of discussion in ballet. The most recent edition of Dance Australia magazine ran an instructional story posing the rhetorical question: ""Can you talk about weight to your students?"" ""Most dancers, and especially dance students, are hyper aware of their appearance and their weight,"" the article read. ""Body dysmorphia and unhealthy dieting are on-going concerns in the dance world, affecting all levels, from students to professionals."" Dance Australia pointed out that teachers were the ""number one influencer"". The Australian Ballet is leading by example. The company's world class dancers are happy and eye-catchingly diverse. ""We really celebrate that,"" Dr Mayes says. ""We've always celebrated that individuality. They're first and foremost an artist, and that's what's important and they're so strong. The things they can do are incredible. And you can't do that without that strength. ""I feel like it's been [that way] for at least the last ten years."" It's a phenomenon that's unique to Australia. ""I can only speak from my experience here in Australia,"" Ms Connelly added. ""The Australian Ballet has always had different kinds of body shapes and sizes and heights and all that sort of thing. And I think that's made us really unique in that it gives us a real texture when you see the whole company on stage. ""We should represent the community that we live in as well. And I think you need to see varying body types to be able to do our repertoire. Our repertoire is really broad, it's pure classical, it's state of the art, cutting edge modern dance, so these dancers have to able to move in such a broad range of ways that we need that choice through the company to be able to deliver."" Former Kangaroos player Wright's role in ballet has been another welcome change. Recruited to play in the AFL from the Victorian country town of Katamatite, Wright wore a North Melbourne jumper in 136 games over eleven seasons. The last few years of his career were troubled by injury. In one traumatic fortnight, he tore all the ligaments in an ankle, got a pain killing injection to play the next week and hurt the other leg. ""I spent a year and half, two years out of the game,"" he says. ""I basically got told by the surgeon that I wasn't going to play footy again."" After several surgeries, the spring-loaded backman was confined to a wheelchair. Wright went to the ballet to seek Dr Mayes' help. ""We heard about the things Sue was doing with other elite athletes around the world and especially in ankles,"" he says. ""We sought her out and I remember walking in here. My toes were sticking up in the air because I didn't have tendons, couldn't wear shoes."" Dr Mayes told Wright: ""We can get you can back playing."" He did eight months of successful rehab surrounded by dancers. ""My first game was 701 days [after the injury] against Sydney,"" he says. He played for another two seasons. During this period, Wright started to value education and work experience in welfare development, and when he finished playing footy, he went back to the ballet. ""We'd been working on a well-being program for the ballet and from there we did a pilot program around well-being, career and personal development, and by the end of the year I was full time,"" he says. He was astonished by the emotional strain of first class dancing. ""I'd rehabbed with the likes of [principal artists] Benedict Bemet for some time so I knew the challenges that they faced in terms of — they're six days a week, they don't get recovery, the mental aspect of it his huge, a lot bigger than footy — a lot more demanding. ""The day-to-day pressure that they're put under from a critique point of view from class to rehearsal to everybody competing for a spot, the amount of reviews and criticisms and feedback that they get is huge."" Wright knew what it was like to be judged by coaches, but not like this. ""And they're ranked as well,"" he says. ""From principals down to core dancers, so there's that side of it as well. ""But it's been really great. We've set up support structures around the dancers. We have a psych [psychologist] in Melbourne, a psych in Sydney, we've got the support stuff – the GP, we've got external consultants, dieticians, and other specialists, so that's been huge to get that support around the dancers. ""For me, it's about concentrating on creating those support structures but also their career and personal development."" When Wright first started his professional development program there were nine of 78 dancers studying for life beyond the stage. There are now more than 50. ""All of a sudden we've created a culture where the stress is taken away for life after dance and they can concentrate on performing,"" he says. ""In the AFL, with me in particular, that was a huge area of stress. When I did get injured, I was like, what am I gonna do next?"" He recalled the ""daunting feeling"" of having no planned future, an anxiety common to professional sport. ""So that's my main focus,"" he says. ""Trying to get dancers to reach their potential on and off stage."" Wright's admiration for the dancers' physical prowess has only been enhanced during his time at the Southbank studios. He cannot believe the dancers recover so quickly between shows. ""In AFL we have a 20 minute light run in the morning and then play the next day, yet these guys are flat out all day and then perform at seven o'clock at night,"" Wright says. ""That was biggest thing that struck me – the lack of time to recover, but they're still expected to go out there and put on world class performances. ""And you've seen how athletic and powerful and brilliant these dancers are. I love AFL. But I've found a new love in this world."" Another advancement taken by the ballet in the past 20 years is the support program for young mothers. Three of the current dancers have children, with principal artists Ako Kondo about to have her first child. ""I'm really excited for this journey but also knowing that the medical team will be there for me to support the recovery,"" Kondo says before one her daily classes. ""I feel very safe to go through this progress even while dancing, so very lucky to be here. ""I've been doing class and a bit of Pilates to just keep the muscles going but not overdoing stuff. I've seen so many previous mums who've done it so I think it's possible."" In the past, female dancers who wanted to start families had to quit. ""The ladies had to retire at about 30,"" Dr Mayes says. ""And the main reason was they decided to have a family."" A new policy was brought in to move pregnant dancers onto ""safe duties"" and back to full fitness after maternal leave. ""And they're amazing when they get fit again. They're fitter than ever,"" she says. Return-to-work conditioning was not as difficult as arranging childcare while on tour, Dr Mayes says. The company now offers payments for nannies or families to go on tour. New mothers are impeccable in their performance on and off stage. ""They come in, get their businesses done, they've got a bit of balance in their life,"" Dr Mayes says. ""And they're really efficient. Do all their rehearsals. Got a great attitude. They know what sleep deprivation is and they've got the strategies to counteract it."" She also benefited from this family-first practice. ""I've had two child that toured with me,"" she says. ""They had a fantastic life of being amongst all the dancers. It was really nurturing, and you can't do it if you can't travel with your children."" For many years, Dr Mayes has fielded request to teach her methods overseas. Days after speaking to ABC Sport she travelled to France to address workshops for physiotherapists on feet and ankles. Her partnership will continue with La Trobe University. Researchers are looking to better track artistic athlete workload. ""Because we don't have the GPS, we're looking at other technologies to do that,"" she says. Another research study is examining the impact of cognitive fatigue on performers. ""Physically they get fatigued but mentally they get fatigue and that's when we see injuries,"" Dr Mayes said. ""We're looking at what impacts that mental or cognitive fatigue. And are there strategies that we can put into place to negate the risks of that with injuries."" Such research would benefit sports coaching. ""Quick coordination of your muscle … we often see the injury at the end of the session, where they start to switch off,"" she says. Audiences might assume big jumps are the most dangerous, but that's another myth. ""It's actually the rate of forced development, so it's the speed of which they do it that is the problem, the fast change of direction – not necessarily the big jumps – and that's a really hard thing to measure: moving, changing direction,"" she says. Meanwhile, professional sports clubs will continue to send their athletes to the ballet for treatment. There is no hubris in any of this, rather a mutual respect. ""It's great to bring the athletes in,"" Dr Mayes says. ""Not only for their sake so they can see how hard the dancers work and get some insight into how the foot can function, but it's also great for our dancers to see [other athletes]. ""Because we do work in a bit of a bubble. So it's really great to open up those boundaries and get them to appreciate what the other athletes are doing.""

200,'Part of something bigger': Women slow-stitch river's biodiversity into quilt with a message ,arts-culture,"  Adelaide River's biodiversity slow-stitched into a community quilt by more than 80 women Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Local artists Meng Hoeschle and Pam Hefner met at night school in the 1980s and have been friends ever since. The pair work together in Darwin's rural region and are among more than 80 women who have spent months slow-stitching a community quilt with a message. ""Neither of us are quilters,"" Ms Hefner said. ""The actual technique, slow-stitching, you don't have to have a lot of skills to do it well."" ""There's no rules, which I love."" The quilt depicts the animals, plants and biodiversity found in the Northern Territory's iconic Adelaide River system, which is best known for its crocodiles. The river is almost 240 kilometres long and flows through several Top End regions, including floodplains on Limilngan-Wulna land. Before the stitching began, each participant was given a list of plant, fish and animal species along with several pieces of recycled calico dyed with indigo to represent water. In her quilt piece, Ms Hoeschle used beads to stitch a native fig tree, popular with birds, and incorporated an old fishing net and bones she had collected. ""On the river there was a piece of fishing net I picked up many, many years ago when I was working at Wadeye."" ""There are lots of bones in the river if you do dredge it, so that's what I was trying to do."" ""Learning about the river is amazing, how beautiful it is – I never knew the Adelaide River was that long, I never knew about the wildlife and especially the habitat."" Behind the scenes has been local artist Jasmine Jan, who has created this community art project and others for the Territory Wildlife Park, where the quilt now hangs. ""A lot of these projects we do with some sort of conservation message or some sort of educational purpose and this one was raising awareness about the Adelaide River system,"" she said. ""It's not just about crocodiles."" ""We like the idea that we're building a community of crafters but also crafters with a purpose."" The final quilt was recently launched to a huge crowd of women, who inspected their contributions stitched together for the first time. ""I knew they would be blown away by it,"" Ms Jan said. ""I like the idea that a quilt is something you use to keep you warm and it's a comforting thing, and I like the idea that everybody's put a little piece of themselves into this quilt."" The project began in October last year and many of the pieces have been stitched in isolation at people's homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It's almost like a cyber community I think – you might not be physically all together but you're all emotionally going on this journey together, being part of something bigger,"" Ms Jan said. Barbara Williams is a building surveyor and her technical drawing skills also happen to be perfect for quilting. She was responsible for planning out and constructing the quilt. ""This is my drafting skills going way back, so actually putting quilts together and that sort of thing is natural to me,"" Ms Williams said. ""Throughout all this, every single piece I looked at was a masterpiece."" ""What people have produced at the end of the day has blown us away completely."" Ms Williams lives at Bee's Creek, a region in Darwin's rural outskirts. ""This is a large river that's in our backyard and most people only know it for the crocodile jumping or the Adelaide River township,"" she said. ""It has an amazing wetlands during the wet season, which blends with the Mary River and is amazing for birdlife."" She said working with such a diverse group of women across Darwin's rural and urban regions – some who had never produced an art piece before – was personally rewarding. ""It's just knowing people's stories and the reason why they've come to do the art and craft work,"" Ms Williams said. ""There's a lot of healing done while working in an art space as well."" ""Each one of these little pieces that make up this quilt is a journey."" Ms Jan said Ms William's elaborate plan for the quilt took her by surprise. ""She whips out this big plan, which has got all the quilt sketched up and all the dimensions and she's worked out how big the blocks have got to be,"" she said. ""I'm just sitting there gobsmacked, thinking oh my goodness she's done all that technical construction work for me."" ""It's amazing working with Barbara, because she has that ability not only in the construction industry but also in crafts."" The quilt was also given a special metal vine hanger with a kingfisher sculpture, constructed and designed by local artists Peter Jettner and Troya Bywaters. Ms Jan said sewing skills had not previously been among her artistic talents but she now also enjoyed slow-stitching. ""I might come home from work when I'm really stressed, I just get my slow stitch and I just sit there and start stitching and it actually is quite meditative,"" she said. ""You actually relax and I think it's quite a stress release.""

201,"This year, the Easter tradition of pysanky eggs is 'more important than ever'",arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog In Ukraine, where churches lie in ruins and the invading Russian army has been accused of war crimes, Easter in 2022 will be a sombre affair. In normal years, this would be a time of celebration. ""People have huge parties,"" says Iryna Roik, a member of the SLAVA Ukrainian Cultural Centre in Adelaide, who emigrated to Australia from Ukraine in 2017. Street festivals with food stalls, entertainment, and displays of giant Ukrainian Easter eggs known as pysanky mark the end of the Lenten period and the resurrection of Christ. In Ukraine, pysanky – eggs decorated using beeswax and dye – are synonymous with Easter. However, pysanky writing is an ancient tradition dating from pre-Christian times when the egg symbolised rebirth and abundance in springtime festivals. With the arrival of Christianity in Ukraine in 988, the pagan tradition of pysanky became part of the rituals observed at Easter. In the Orthodox Church, Easter is observed one week later than in Western Christianity. A family traditionally sits down on Easter Thursday to make the year's pysanky to add to a special basket of Easter goods, says Sonia Mycak from the Ukrainian Association of Sydney. Also added to the basket are paska, a sweet bread only baked at Easter, hunks of ham and cheese, and krashanky, hard-boiled eggs dyed a single colour. ""On Easter Saturday, you go to an all-night church service, and you take with you the special wicker basket,"" says Sonia, who was born in Australia to Ukrainian parents. ""At about three or four in the morning after the church service is done, the priest blesses these baskets with holy water."" It's a magical moment, she says. ""It doesn't matter whether you're a religious person or not, it's a spiritual experience, a rebirth, a feeling that something new is happening."" The blessed basket is then taken home and its contents consumed for breakfast, breaking the long Lenten fast and kicking off a day of Easter feasting. For much of the 20th century, pysanky writing was outlawed in Ukraine under the atheist Soviet regime. ""All Ukrainian cultural traditions, and particularly religious traditions, were banned,"" says Sonia. Sonia's maternal grandmother, who grew up in a village in eastern Ukraine, made pysanky as a child in the years before the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. While Sonia has heard of people in Ukraine secretly making pysanky late at night during the Soviet era, she says her grandmother was too afraid to try it herself. It was only after she emigrated to Australia in 1949 as a 50-year-old that she started making pysanky again. ""She had to make the implements herself,"" says Sonia. Banned in Ukraine, the Easter ritual of pysanky writing flourished among the Ukrainian diaspora in places like Canada, the United States and Australia. Since its independence in 1991, Ukraine has seen a resurgence in local traditions such as pysanky. ""It's an opportunity to hand down cultural knowledge from elders to little kids,"" says Iryna, who remembers receiving pysanky lessons sitting on her grandmother's knee as a child. In Sonia's family, pysanky writing is a cherished tradition that has also been passed down through generations. ""My grandmother is now deceased, but she wrote them, my mother wrote them, I wrote them, now my daughter writes them."" Men, too, participate in Easter pysanky making. Sonia remembers her father, who was from western Ukraine, making pysanky with simple patterns. Sonia runs annual pysanky making workshops for families who attend the Ukrainian Association of Sydney's school. ""The fathers will be sitting and writing them too,"" she says. Sonia gives me a pysanka writing lesson via Zoom with the demonstration eggs she uses at workshops as props. She picks up a kistka – a specialised tool with a small scoop at the end that funnels into a nib-like aperture – that she uses to mark out the basic design on a plain egg. ""Instead of writing with ink, you're writing with wax."" Sonia demonstrates how she scoops melted beeswax with the kistka to draw on the egg, explaining that ""what is underneath the wax will remain white"". Next, the egg is dipped in dye – yellow first, followed by darker colours. Where melted wax is applied to the dyed egg will stay yellow. She dips the egg in red dye next, drawing on the shell once more with melted wax before subjecting the egg to one final dip in green dye. At this stage, the egg is an unbecoming shade of brown and covered in ridged patterns created by the layers of melted wax. ""It's hideous,"" Sonia says with a laugh. The final step removes the wax with a candle flame, a painstaking procedure that requires patience. Hold the flame too close to the egg for too long and it can crack, destroying your handiwork. ""It can be a heartbreaking process,"" she says. Wiping away the layers of wax reveals a brightly coloured and surprisingly intricate pattern underneath. With the egg's contents blown out via small holes in each end, pysanky can last for years. In fact, the oldest recovered pysanka dates from the ninth century. ""If you leave the yolk in there, that's when they'll explode, and there's nothing worse than an exploding pysanka,"" notes Sonia. Sometimes – ""if you're lucky"" – the yolk and albumen dry in the egg. ""But then a year later, there'll be an inexplicable smell in the room, and you know it's time to go and check your pysanka eggs."" Preserved pysanky serve as a family record, says Sonia, who still has the first pysanky her daughter Polina, now 19, made as a child. Also in Sonia's collection are pysanky she wrote after she finished high school. ""It's almost a kind of meditative process,"" she says. ""I found it a very soothing thing to do when I was contemplating my next phase in life when I was 17."" Pysanky designs and motifs vary from region to region in Ukraine. ""Now when we do them, we don't necessarily stick to the regions of our ancestors – we do funky patterns we like,"" says Sonia. Sonia favours geometric patterns, while Polina prefers figurative designs depicting motifs such as animals and churches. ""You find your own style,"" she says. One pysanka in Sonia's collection shows her grandmother's village in eastern Ukraine, not far from the besieged city of Chernihiv near the border with Belarus. Sonia, whose last trip to Ukraine was in November 2019, still feels a sense of disbelief at Russia's invasion of her family's homeland. She says that Chernihiv has been destroyed after coming under fierce attack from the Russian army. ""Streets that I walked on are rubble. People I probably passed on the street could be dead. The Russians cut the water supply, so there was no water, no electricity, so no heating, and it was cold. People were lining up for bread."" Sonia says the tradition of making pysanky has taken on extra significance this Easter. ""At a time when Ukrainians are fighting for their very existence – their lives and land, their culture and identity – it is even more important than ever that we express our Ukrainian cultural specificity through our traditional practices."" The ABC's Religion & Ethics portal is home to reporting on religion, ethical discussion and inspiring stories of faith and belief. Iryna's family lives in Kyiv, which also endured bombing before Russian forces withdrew from the city in early April. This year, Iryna will be making pysanky eggs with her eight-year-old son Roma in Australia. She feels guilty that she can celebrate Easter while her family and friends suffer such hardship in Ukraine. However, she says, ""we decided that kids should have their Easter – it's OK. We have to preserve our culture, and we have to keep our spirits up."" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

203,Here’s your reading guide to the best new writing by Australian women and non-binary writers,arts-culture,"  The Stella Prize 2022 shortlist spotlights the best books by Australian women and non-binary writers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Safe to say, this year’s Stella Prize shortlist has broken the mould. For a prize that was already somewhat revolutionary in promoting women and then non-binary writers, and for throwing fiction and non-fiction into the same $50,000 prize pool, this year represents another revolution: the inclusion of poetry. The result was a kaleidoscopic longlist that spanned from short story, poetry and essay collections to a graphic novel, long-form experimental essay, cultural memoir, and just two novels; and from this, a shortlist dominated by poetry and experimental non-fiction, and with the first-ever shortlisted graphic novel. It feels like Stella has begun a new chapter. Chair of this year’s judging panel, Miles Franklin-winning author Melissa Lucashenko (Too Much Lip), writes: “The 2022 Stella Prize shortlist is big on emerging voices writing in unconventional ways — from regions, positions, and literary forms that transcend the mainstream. These authors are writing back, insisting that ‘other' lives – First Nations lives, poor women's lives, queer lives, and Filipina lives – matter on the page just as they do in everyday affairs.” Taking you through this six-book reading list are RN's book experts: Claire Nichols and Sarah L'Estrange from RN's The Book Show and Kate Evans from RN's The Bookshelf. The Stella Prize winner will be announced on April 28. Magabala Books Homecoming doesn't look like the other books on this year's shortlist — or indeed any other book I've read this year. Its unique structure alternates poetry, prose and archival material to tell the story of four generations of Noongar women from WA writer and academic Elfie Shiosaki's family. These four ancestors, who Shiosaki collectively calls grandmothers, demonstrated incredible courage and resilience while living through key moments in Australia's shameful colonial history. Mattalan, the eldest, ""belonged to the ancestral waterways of her Wilman moort in the south west of Australia"", in pre-colonisation times; her daughter Mary was an early advocate for Aboriginal women's rights; Elfie's great-grandmother Olive was separated from her family and raised in native settlements; and Elfie's grandmother Helen was raised in secret, as Olive tried to avoid the authorities who might take her away. The women's stories are told in fragments — in poems, letters, and through artefacts (there are reproductions of a handwriting worksheet and paperbark painting by Olive, for example). Shiosaki's creative treatment of each fragment elevates it to something of great power. Oral histories are transformed into poetry: the testimony of Olive is delicately laid out on the page, highlighting the music of her voice. Homecoming is an incredibly impressive debut. CN Giramondo TAKE CARE is the second poetry collection by Eunice Andrada, who was born and raised in the Philippines. There are poems about the Filipino diaspora, rape culture and the dehumanising machinery of both war and online domains. Throughout are references to bodies in their soft tenderness and also as sites of abuse and exploitation. TAKE CARE is divided into four sections: “TAKE:”, “: COMFORT”, “: REVENGE” and “: CARE”. While the tone is intimate and compassionate, the work is complex in the way it probes the dual forces of patriarchy and imperialism. There is anger here too, at historical and contemporary instances of sexual violence against women. The title of Andrada's poem Subtle Asian Traits is taken from the name of a popular Facebook group, and it subverts stereotypes about Asian people by describing specific experiences: ""my Asian insomnia, my Asian speechlessness, / my Asian exhaustion — I keep labelling until / the words run clear."" In the poem Sexual Assault Report Questionnaire: Describe your hair., Andrada highlights the gendered nature of the justice system: the question, we're told in the Notes section, is an actual field on a sexual assault reporting form from the New South Wales Police. Andrada's tender and vital treatment highlights the obtuseness of such a question in the context of sexual assault. Personal testimony and historical reckoning are layered to powerful effect. The collection is lyrical and beautiful, but you'll be left seething with anger at the injustices Andrada so skillfully highlights in this collection. SL Text A woman receives a message on Facebook, out of the blue, calling her by a name she had shed 20 years and two countries ago. It jolts her back into her old life and earlier self: a childhood in Australia in the late 70s and early 80s — a place of poverty and precarity, and occasional kindness. In the first few pages of this remarkable, brutal book, we meet a woman named Holly, in 2018; but for most of the rest of it, we're in Maggie's life. ""I was five when I went into resi,"" she tells us. Residential care and foster homes; places where she and another girl learnt to communicate through the walls of the house, tapping in code. Sounds sweet, doesn't it? ""He's coming,"" is one of the messages. Not so sweet after all. And this detailed, carefully observed, tenderness-and-rage study of childhood on the edge would probably be enough to make this book memorable. But there's more. Maggie grows up. What else happens, what propels her into those opening pages of the book, had me clutching my hair and putting the book down. Gasping. And I promise I'm not a melodramatic reader. Pick it up again though, won't you? KE Fantagraphics Rendered in gorgeous hues of black, white, grey and blue, this graphic novel is about Ray and Bron, the ""weird queer aunties"" to their young niece Nessie. When we first meet them, the three are playing in nature, their faces transformed into those of grinning, sharp-toothed monsters. But when Ray's sister Amanda calls to interrupt the fun, the monsters vanish, and we see these characters in all their mundanity and pain. The tension between the three adults is high. Amanda, who is a single mother to Nessie, has a problem with Bron. Ray tries to keep the peace, but eventually the tension starts to wear away at her relationship with Bron. Lee Lai – an Australian cartoonist living in Montreal – has a great ear for dialogue. The conversations between Ray, Bron and Amanda veer from warm and funny to cruel and heartbreaking, and are always believable. There is much heavy material in this book, but the scenes of Bron, Ray and Nessie playing together are joyful and touching. As Lai writes in the book, the days the three spend together are ""like little islands of solace"" in ""a time that I think we both came to remember as an ocean of shit"". CN University of Queensland Press Dropbear is the debut poetry collection by Evelyn Araluen, an award-winning writer, and co-editor of Overland literary journal. While it is playful and satirical in tone (with titles like THE LAST BUSH BALLAD and Appendix Australis), it is also deeply serious in its interrogation and deconstruction of Australian colonial mythology. Araluen layers imagery and literary references; in the poem Dropbear Poetics, for example, the creation story of Tiddalik sits alongside a reference to May Gibbs's Snugglepot. Elsewhere she draws on Dorothy Wall's Blinky Bill and the works of D.H. Lawrence, Banjo Patterson and Kenneth Slessor, among others. (At the end of the book, she provides a helpful explanation of the literary references that appear.) Gibbs's seemingly innocent gumnut babies are cast in a new light in the poem Mrs Kookaburra Addresses the Natives, in which Araluen directly incorporates the author's words to highlight the demeaning way Indigenous peoples are referred to in her famous Snugglepot and Cuddlepie series. In her acknowledgements, Araluen writes: ""Many lives and stories have been erased, exploited or violated in the short but haunted history of Australian literature."" This collection is an electrifying literary recalibration. SL Giramondo Grief can knock you flat, send the world off its axis, make you reach for all the metaphors. And for Anwen Crawford, an image of a horse in a knacker's yard is just one of the ways she searches for understanding in No Document: her hybrid essay-reflection-poem-tribute to both a friend and collaborator, to art, and to politics. They were friends at art school, and took part in guerrilla art – and she was on the other side of the world when he died. She feels that because they were friends, her grief was not recognised or taken seriously, but she needs to honour it. The latest and best fiction reviewed by a team of dedicated bibliophiles. In doing so, she uses fragments and reflections. Stories sit in tension between the highly personal and the public, political, and historical — veering between those terrible feelings that are both interior and expansive; particular and vague. Grief can be about place: walking past an underpass and hearing the hiss of spray paint from a shared graffiti excursion years before. But in reflecting on loss, she also reveals what she gained from this friendship, as a force for creativity, ideas. This is a book that teeters between the intellectual and the emotional, ending with a powerful oomph of poetry: ""Sometimes I sense / there is only a membrane / between us. / Sometimes I hear you in the light.""

204,They've already featured in movies. Now these historic bridges have their own 'love song',arts-culture,"  Film project takes up fight to save historic, wooden bridges on NSW far south coast Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Five historic, wooden bridges on the New South Wales far south coast have been captured in film, while their future hangs in the balance. The much-loved structures have become iconic tourist destinations along the Tathra-Bermagui Road but locals have been fighting hard to save them for the past 12 months. In early 2021 the state government announced funding to replace some local wooden bridges with concrete ones to ""improve safety and community connection,"" which prompted a community backlash. In an attempt to highlight the beauty of these bridges and their significance to the community, Lindy Hume came up with the idea to showcase them in an art installation of five films for the far south coast's Four Winds Festival over Easter. ""We're not making a political piece of work,"" said Ms Hume, the festival's creative director. ""This is a love song to the Tathra-Bermagui Road and to those bridges. ""It's very, very clear the connection that people feel to those bridges and we wanted to express that."" Structures like the Cuttagee Bridge are no stranger to the spotlight. In 2001, the bridge featured in Billy Connolly's film The Man Who Sued God and has become a popular tourist attraction. Now, the bridge has been showcased in an entirely different genre of film. The Traveller is a short piece by artist David Hewitt that uses percussive sound to bring the bridge, and surrounding landscape, to life. The Wallaga Lake Bridge was also used as a location in another Hollywood film, the Unbroken, directed by Angelina Jolie. The Home Stretch project is a collaboration between artists on the far south coast, using a range of film genres to tell the story of these bridges. The films will be installed at venues along the Tathra-Bermagui Road over the Easter long weekend as part of the Four Winds Festival, to allow an interactive experience for travellers. Artist Louise Morris from Navigate Arts, who helped create one of the films at Sandy Creek called Down by the Water, is hopeful the art will play a role in saving the structures. ""They're so special for a number of reasons and I think these pieces of art really bring that to the surface,"" she said. ""They hold history, they hold memories and they are part of the experience of this area."" In April last year, the community protested against the decision to upgrade the Cuttagee Bridge into a concrete structure. At a community meeting in June, the local Bega Valley Shire Council said it couldn't commit to the requirement of completing the project within two years, resulting in a withdrawal of the initial funding from the state government. However, the council committed to continuing to work towards a solution for the bridge. Following structural assessments by the council late last year, it was determined that major repair works would be needed to keep the structure safe and standing. It's still uncertain what will happen to these bridges, including Cuttagee, in the future. Despite this, the community hasn't given up hope. ""They are vital and important structures that need to be maintained in the area,"" Ms Morris said. ""Many of them are in need of repair and structural reinforcement but I'm of the mind that that can be done while that historical facade is kept and maintained.""

205,Businesses not quite ready to let guard down as COVID mask rules ease over holidays,arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As tourists embrace the Easter long weekend and school holidays get into full swing, bare-faced customers will greet some businesses in the Eyre Peninsula and upper Spencer Gulf region, as mask and QR-code mandates are lifted. Premier Peter Malinauskas announced earlier this week that from the Easter long weekend, masks would no longer be required in retail shops, supermarkets and licensed venues such as pubs and clubs, or in personal care locations including hairdressers and beauty salons. Masks will still be compulsory in high-risk settings such as hospitals, aged care or residential disability facilities, on public transport and in ride-sharing vehicles. The relaxation of COVID mandates has been welcomed by some businesses, but not everyone intends to let their guard down. Sandy Palm, who works in retail for Williams Shoes in port Lincoln, said she would continue to wear a mask at work. ""I just believe with the amount of contact we have with [customers], especially tourists, I feel more comfortable with leaving my mask on,"" she said. Boston Bay Diner owner Nino Tangredi says he has no issues with the relaxation of the pandemic rules. ""I've told my employees that if they wish to wear the mask it's up to them,"" he said. ""I personally will continue to wear my mask as the ramifications for businesses is just too harsh. ""We'd have to shut down basically [if he caught COVID]."" Danny Walker, from Breeze Bistro in Whyalla, says he thinks COVID-19 will spread more quickly once the mask mandate is lifted. ""But our staff are going to keep wearing masks all the time,"" he said. ""We want to keep our workers, we don't want our workers going down with COVID-19 and having to shut our shop down because we just can't afford it."" Mark Hanlon, chair of Business Port Pirie, which represents more than 100 businesses in the region, said there would no doubt be some apprehension about the rule changes. ""But all in all, they will also be excited that things are moving on and in a positive manner, which will be good for retail and hospitality,"" he said. ""Hopefully we are not letting our guard down too early and we still stay relatively safe through the winter months."" Mr Hanlon said the community had shown great adaptability during the pandemic. ""There is not one person who walks into our store that we have to give a mask to anymore, it has become part of their uniform,"" he said. ""It has kept us safe for quite a while, but having said that, we are all sick and tired of it."" A decision on whether masks will be retained in schools will be made within weeks, before the upcoming school holidays reach their end. Sandra Hewson, principal at St Mark's College in Port Pirie, said the mandates, along with student compliance, had contributed to keeping infection rates low at the school. She said the school would continue to follow mandate instructions from SA Health, in conjunction with Catholic Education, which had not changed. ""Students have done the right thing and they have done it graciously in supporting and keeping their peers and teachers safe in term one,"" Dr Hewson said. ""I don't think I would go it alone as a principal and insist on staff and students wearing masks if that is not supported by SA Health and Catholic Education."" Dr Hewson said there had been a decline in attendance rates in the lead-up to Easter as families tried to protect their children from COVID-19 ahead fo the holidays. ""I think it is a very timely circuit breaker,"" she said. ""What we are noticing here is that absence rates have increased significantly, particularly for this week, and I think parents are deciding to withdraw children so that they are not at risk of exposure or infection, so as not to spoil any holiday plans coming up, which I do understand."" With Easter already here, we'll soon find out what the absence of masks will mean for both businesses and families.

206,'I think it found a niche': How a game designed in a Brisbane apartment won Game of the Year at the BAFTAs,arts-culture,"  Meet the Brisbane couple who claimed two major prizes at the BAFTA Game Awards Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A Brisbane couple has turned the dreaded experience of moving house into two BAFTA awards. Wren Brier and Tim Dawson are part of a small team that created Unpacking, a part block-fitting puzzle and part home-decoration game, in which players are invited to create a satisfying living space while learning clues about the life they are unpacking. The couple say the game is based on their own experience of moving in together. The game took out two of the top gongs at the BAFTA Game Awards last Thursday: Best Narrative and Game of the Year. It defeated heavyweight titles such as Returnal and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and studio juggernauts like Sony and Electronic Arts. Brier attributed the popularity of Unpacking to its therapeutic nature. ""I think it found a niche that wasn't being served by a lot of games,"" Brier said. ""We also had a lot of luck with the timing of the game. ""Right now people are looking for wholesome games and games that are more about relaxing and finding a place of peace in the chaos of our world today. ""Unpacking does that and I think this is a niche that's becoming more and more popular these days."" Brier and Dawson were moving in together about four years ago when the idea for the game was born. ""I noticed you unpack one box and unlock the box underneath. You're completing sets of items between boxes. You're putting items together on the shelf,"" Brier said. ""There is also this ability for storytelling because you can tell a lot about a person from the items that they own. ""In general, a lot of what you do is you create order out of chaos. And in this game, we do that in a very literal way."" The game took the couple three and a half years to develop, all from their Toowong apartment. Dawson said travelling to the BAFTAs and a game developer conference in San Francisco made the pair realise how widely the game had resonated with players. ""It kind of hits home how big everything is when you're actually leaving Brisbane and seeing people celebrating the game in other cities,"" he said. Unpacking was developed by Brisbane-based game studio Witch Beam, which Dawson co-founded. The team received about $60,000 in funding from Screen Queensland through the Queensland government to go towards development costs and some travel costs. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Screen Queensland chief executive Kylie Munnich said the Brisbane gaming industry was ""not just surviving, but thriving"". ""Games are the biggest segment of the entertainment and media space in the world,"" she said. ""They actually far outstrip film and television, and so it's a space as a screen agency we should be in. ""We know there are a lot of very creative, clever people in Queensland who deserve to be able to have their careers here, create their games here, and then have those games be successful not only in Australia but in the world."" Screen Queensland on Thursday launched its Game Grants Program to provide up to $90,000 in funding to Queensland-based game projects at various stages. It follows the recent launch of Screen Queensland's Digital Games Incentive, which offers eligible game developers who spend a minimum of $250,000 in the state a 15 per cent rebate on costs.

210,This sci-fi comedy stars action film legend Michelle Yeoh as immigrant mum turned superhero,arts-culture,"  Everything Everywhere All at Once sets Michelle Yeoh loose on Daniels’ multiverse in existential sci-fi comedy with kung fu Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog If you could be any version of yourself in a universe of infinite possibilities, which would you choose? It's a question that runs through the heart of the highwire genre hybrid Everything Everywhere All at Once, which – if the title, which could be a lyric from Bo Burnham's internet satire, wasn't a giveaway – concerns Hollywood's latest commercial obsession, the multiverse: that parallel-reality home to Neos and Spider-Men and all the IP studios seem ready to summon with endless variations on the same. A somewhat more ambitious application of the concept, this second film from music video mavericks turned feature directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert – who collectively go by Daniels – is, among other things, an existential sci-fi thriller, a kung fu throwdown, a tender immigrant story, a loving tribute to one screen icon and a heroic resuscitation of another, and a warp-speed ride through a half-century of cinema sprinkled with scatological, 00s internet humour. It's already the Best Movie Ever according to users of the social media platform Letterboxd, a site with which Everything Everywhere shares more than a touch of effusive film-fan sensibility. Daniels's greatest asset is, of course, the indelible Chinese Malaysian star Michelle Yeoh, a bona fide legend of both Hong Kong action cinema (Royal Warriors; The Heroic Trio) and global hits (Tomorrow Never Dies; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) who's become a kind of all-purpose Chinese matron for lazy Hollywood, in movies like Crazy Rich Asians and Marvel's Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Yeoh brings the weight of her career to the role of Evelyn Wang, a middle-aged Chinese American immigrant who lives above the Simi Valley, California laundromat she owns and operates with her meek, slightly goofy husband, Waymond – Ke Huy Quan, 80s child star of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and The Goonies, all grown up and returned from a long and roundabout wilderness – and her sardonic, increasingly distant 20-something daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu). Once upon a time in China, Evelyn dreamed of becoming an actor; now, she's a harried mum stressing over her penny-pinching clientele and worried that her ancient, notoriously disapproving father (James Hong), who's visiting from the mainland, will freak out when he discovers Joy is bringing her girlfriend (Tallie Medel) to the upcoming Chinese New Year bash. Worse, the Wangs are hauled into the cavernous, multistorey local branch of the IRS to face off with an officious auditor – played by Jamie Lee Curtis in a mustard turtleneck, prosthetic stomach and Dr Zaius wig – who threatens them with financial ruin. All that, and a dejected Waymond is about to file for divorce. Domestic crisis soon transforms into science fiction fantasy when another version of Waymond – an emissary from one of many multiverses, which owes a sizeable debt to The Matrix – materialises to jolt Evelyn out of her funk, and suddenly she finds herself at the nexus of every possible version of reality, battling a cosmic force determined to plunge the multiverse into chaos. Just another day at the tax office, then. As the film tumbles into a hyperactive, shapeshifting narrative, Evelyns of every dimension flash before us. In one reality, she's become a (who'd've guessed) Hong Kong action movie star, in sequences spliced with red-carpet clips of the real-life Yeoh and romantic scenes that mimic the films of Wong Kar-wai. As worlds shift, so does the frame: a standard 1.85:1 aspect ratio for the world of reality; grainy Academy ratio for flashbacks; Shawscope-like anamorphic wide-screen for the kung fu-powered multiverse action. The chaos from which Evelyn must save the multiverse, it turns out, is none other than a mischievous version of her own daughter. A super-kawaii hellion who calls herself Jobu Tupaki, this trans-dimensional diva is a true child of the digital age, capable of experiencing every moment in time and space simultaneously. Played by Hsu with an irresistible insouciance, she's a chaotic force of possibility, of unbounded queerness, animated by the power to transcend the labels and limits that humanity imposes upon itself. ""You're still hung up on the fact that I like girls in this world,"" she scoffs at her real-world mum. ""The universe is so much bigger than you realise."" Despite the movie's antic, splintered reality, it's an age-old story of mother-daughter conflict – Turning Red in Philip K. Dick cosplay – haunted by the generational disapproval of a stern, traditional grandfather. This tale of life's regrets, of immigrant dreams dashed in transit, is inherently moving, even as it feels at odds with a film whose formal qualities are designed to overpower and subdue its audience. Daniels, whose 2016 debut Swiss Army Man was surprisingly mawkish for a film about a farting corpse, have a tendency to over-bake their absurdism and sentimentality. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. Their millennial hipster weakness for rAnDoM amazeballs humour yields both eye-rollingly unfunny bits (butt plug gags, a universe-collapsing 'everything' bagel) and some pretty inspired goofs – an imagined timeline where humanity evolved to have hot dogs for fingers, complete with a 2001 Dawn of Man parody, is mostly charming, as is an animatronic raccoon and the movie's surfeit of googly eyes (never not funny). It all adds up to the sort of chirpy, cartoon surrealism that takes its cues less from the pan-dimensional unease of, say, Apichatpong Weerasethakul or David Lynch, whose movies genuinely engage with, and succumb to, the multiplicities of identity and psychic drift, than it does the comic-book storytelling of the superhero genre, where the multiverse is but a vehicle for familiar narrative comforts (it's no surprise to discover that the Russo brothers, the team behind Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, served as producers). But the movie is such a monument to Yeoh that its occasional corniness, even its eager-to-please, gag-a-minute brio, can't help but add to the strangely moving effect. That the veteran star can play fast, hyperkinetic comedy and soulful melodrama has long been a given, but the way she draws these strands together, and layers them with an extra-textual sense of life's regret, is a remarkable show of her range – a screen star reconciling a life that might have been with the one she's lived. ""I saw my life without you,"" Evelyn tells Waymond in one of the film's most resonant scenes, as though she'd caught of glimpse of Yeoh's off-screen fame. ""It was beautiful."" It's a great tribute, and yet it's Quan who – as he did in Temple of Doom, the weirdest, wildest, and best of the Spielberg-Lucas adventure series – nearly steals the show, having lost none of his ability to mix childlike sincerity with snappy humour, even after all these years away from the camera. Call it the Quanaissance. Waymond's sense of a life unlived, of resigning himself to the background, is doubly affecting given Quan's explosive career start and Hollywood's subsequent indifference; the movie functions as a kind of alternate timeline where he and fellow 80s stars Yeoh and James Hong, the enduring cult icon of Blade Runner and Big Trouble in Little China, got to dominate American cinema into the future. It's this world of possibility, of resurrections and alternate futures, that makes Daniels's deference to rote narrative, to learning to embrace what's 'real' and right in front of you, more than a little dispiriting. At one point, Evelyn chooses chaos, and it seems like she and Joy might throw the multiverse into thrilling disorder, when a rapid-fire experimental montage reconfigures Evelyn as an alien, an anime goddess, an otherworldly traveller; no rules, just infinite, post-human potential. It yields the film's one truly transcendent moment, in which the Wang women find themselves reincarnated in a peaceful timeline where humans never existed – like something out of The Tree of Life, with pet rocks standing in for cosmic montage. But Daniels pull their existential punches, walking back from the curiosity of the unknown to put their faith in love, kindness, and other quaint human stand-bys. In a multiverse filled with so many possibilities and transformations of self, the film's sentimental send-off – as forcefully moving as it is – feels like a missed opportunity. Still, getting there is quite a ride. Whichever way you dice it, there's nothing else quite like it in mainstream American cinema at the multiplex.

211,"From wedding tapes to holiday albums, how libraries are bringing old memories back to life",arts-culture,"  Digital conversion stations at Brisbane libraries bring old slides, videos and memories back to life Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A new program at two Brisbane libraries is allowing residents to digitise slides, VHS tapes and audiotapes for free, unlocking thousands of long-lost memories. The service allows people to put their materials through a high-powered scanner, specially modified tape recorder, or VHS player, converting them to digital files on a USB. Carindale library assistant Daniel Milkovic has run the library's media conversion station for months, putting on more than 300 sessions to date for local residents eager to relive their memories. Mr Milkovic says it is a privilege to witness the often-emotional reactions from people seeing their old photos and videos for the first time in years. ""One customer recorded her wedding tape she hadn't seen for 30 years. Her husband passed away, it … almost brought me to tears,"" he says. In another instance, a 30-year-old holiday in the United States was revealed for the very first time, as slides that were so dark they were unusable when first taken were finally revealed through the scanner's powerful photo editing software. ""We just brought these slides back to life. It was amazing. And the people, they were just absolutely over the moon,"" Mr Milkovic says. ""Photos of friends from San Francisco they hadn't seen for years, people who had passed away. It was beautiful."" People wanting to use the station must book in for an introductory session to learn how to use the equipment, as well as information on what to bring, and how to save their digitised photos and tapes. Mr Milkovic says many people make multiple trips, bringing boxes upon boxes of old slides to convert. But users may also need to be patient, as the VHS and audiotape digitisation process must happen in real-time. ""If you've got a two-hour VHS, you're going to sit here for two hours. Luckily, we have a lot of books and magazines,"" he says. After the success of the first conversion station at Carindale, a second one recently opened at Chermside library on Brisbane's northside. Mr Milkovic says the media conversion station brings ""so much value"" to the library, as well as joy for customers. ""Working in libraries I guess we definitely persevere to try to preserve things, history and knowledge,"" he says. ""This gives the people the tools and power to do it themselves.""

212,"Ballarat Tramway Museum on track to double visitor numbers to 60,000, staff say",arts-culture,"  Ballarat Tramway Museum on fast track to welcome 60,000 visitors, staff say Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Staff at Ballarat's historic tram museum hope major upgrades will help double annual visitor numbers to 60,000. A few hundred metres from the sparkling Lake Wendouree and its beloved walking track, Ballarat Tramway Museum's significant makeover is picking up speed. The site's once-dingy display shed has reopened and museum president Paul Mong says the repainted, light-filled space allows the tram collection to shine. With a further $1.2 million of state government funding secured, the century-old tram track is also being overhauled. ""We're basically digging up rail … dating back to 1905,"" Mr Mong said. Once the transformation is complete it is hoped transport buffs of all ages will be able to enjoy a smoother, safer ride on a historic tram before making their way into the museum. ""Being able to showcase the tram collection with a modern touch, and also be able to ride the trams, will be very important for tourism,"" Mr Mong said. Marketing manager Peter Waugh was confident the site's multi-faceted face lift would allow it to become a ""destination"" in Ballarat. ""We would normally attract 30,000 visitors a year, so I'm hoping we can double that,"" he said. One of the museum's 70 volunteers, James Proctor, believed the 50-year-old museum could achieve the ambitious goal. According to data from Tourism Research Australia, Melbourne remains Ballarat's main source of tourists, but Mr Proctor said visitors might start to come from much further afield. ""I've visited tram museums all over the world and this is really one of the best,"" he said. Melbourne tram buff Roger Cochrane recently made the trip from Melbourne and said experiencing the museum and its restored trams was a ""privilege"". ""Some of these trams are very similar to ones I was riding on in the '80s,"" he said. ""It brings back memories of having to swing yourself onto the tram before it took off and running after it.""

213,Sacred ancestral burial grounds under threat from national park tourism,arts-culture,"  Barngarla women worried sacred sites under Nauo native title claim threatened by tourism Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Elders from the Port Lincoln Barngarla Richards family say their sacred ancestral burial grounds in the Lincoln National Park are being damaged by park visitors and they've been left without a say through the native title process. They say a burial ground, which is a sacred men's area, is close to a popular sand dune in the Lincoln National Park where sand boarding was recently approved. But their claim to the area is under contention, which limits their ability to protect the site. Despite having story lines that tie them to the area, the Barngarla people have twice been refused native title over Lincoln National Park and the area south including Whalers' Way. The Barngarla people first applied for native title over the southern Eyre Peninsula in 1996 but the federal court rejected it in 2015. They applied a second time and lost in 2020 on the basis the new claim was not any different to the original one. As a result, the Barngarla were ordered to pay costs to the state. Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation (BDAC) chair Jason Bilney says his community lost the area based on ""white man's law"" but there were other ways to protect sacred sites. He says he intends to engage an anthropologist to assess the area with the hope of registering the burial sites under the Heritage Act, which would provide protections over them. The assessment would also address the issue that there is currently no documentation of Barngarla sites within the park. ""I've grown up in Port Lincoln and I know the significance of the south of Port Lincoln,"" Mr Bilney said. ""It's very hurtful for myself let alone for my community and also for Barngarla as a whole, but we can still protect them and preserve what sites we do have within the national park."" Elders Lavinia Richards and Elizabeth Richards said their family had stories passed down about their connection to the area. Elizabeth says there are sacred sites connected to women's business. ""Old mumma took me out and showed me the story lines so out that way is very sacred,"" she said. ""We have caves out there, too, which are very sacred and I've heard that strangers are going there."" The Elders say they are hurt and angry they do not have native title over the area. The Barngarla are not the only people laying claim to the area. It forms part of a native title consent determination for the Nauo people, in a claim that also includes Coffin Bay and land up north-west to Venus Bay. While the Barngarla maintain it is their land, the Nauo people equally say it is theirs. The native title bid had been confrontational and affected families in the community. And the Nauo people are not commenting while native title is progressing. ""You hear about all the different government departments and we feel like we've been shut down and shut out and not included in conversation about our country and what it means to us and to have it just disappear because someone comes and they want this country, it's wrong,"" Elizabeth says. She says the Barngarla remain concerned that an approved Nauo claim will reduce their ability to protect their sacred sites and their women's Seven Sisters storyline. A Department for Environment and Water spokesperson said DEW was committed to the protection of Aboriginal sites. ""DEW recognises that traditional ownership negotiations are progressing at Lincoln National Park and the Barngarla and Nauo peoples are recognised as groups having a strong cultural connection and interest in the lower Eyre Peninsula."" They said the state government's Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation (AAR) division maintained a central archive of details of all known, reported and recorded Aboriginal sites, objects and remains. ""If there is a concern that sites, objects and/or remains are being damaged, disturbed or interfered with, DEW will work with traditional owners and AAR to ensure sites are protected,"" the spokesperson said. Mr Bilney said while the Barngarla do not accept that the land as Nauo land, after two rejected court cases they can not apply for native title again. ""We lost it in the courts so it's about protecting and preserving our heritage, putting [heritage information] site cards in but also working collaboratively together; even if we could have a co-management,"" Mr Bilney said. ""It's always a possibility for co-management, which we already have a co-management with Barngarla, Wirungu and Kokatha in the Gawler Ranges, similar to what they do in the Far West Coast where they have Mirning, Wirungu, Kokatha and Yalata all as part of the Far West Coast."" The Nauo people lodged their native title claim in 1997 and it remains under negotiation with the state.

214,Three-quarters of WA's arts sector at risk of closure if further COVID restrictions hit,arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A survey from the peak body for WA's arts sector has painted a picture of an industry in crisis due to impacts of COVID restrictions. The survey had 296 industry respondents from regional and metropolitan areas and was conducted by the Chamber of Arts and Culture. Alarmingly, between 58 and 63 per cent of small to medium organisations reported they would be operating on reserves or would need to cease operating in the next 12 months. While 75 per cent of all organisations said they would not be able to continue operating on current income streams if there were further restrictions forcing cancellations of shows and programs. The chamber's executive director, Kim Jameson, said West Australian Music's (WAM) recent announcement that it was letting go of its regional team was evidence of the fallout. ""They've had to face some very obvious financial challenges and make some very serious decisions, so we're starting to see the impact of that already,"" Ms Jameson said. Kyron Smithson runs a small business, KyzaPresents, which coordinates the majority of the music industry in Esperance on WA's south coast. Mr Smithson said ticketed shows were the backbone of his business's financial sustainability, but recent restrictions meant he was unable to put on any this year, which led him to lose 90 per cent of his income compared to the same time last year. He said he had been forced to dip into reserve funds. ""Running a business where all I'm doing is covering the bills and if something happens I have to dip into my reserves, that's not a sustainable business model."" Mr Smithson said WAM's decision to cut its regional team was a ""massive"" loss for the industry and regional officer Nigel Bird, who lost his job in the cuts, had supported Esperance musicians for years. ""He's just someone that I could turn to and talk to about all and everything and his work created a lot of opportunities for Esperance artists,"" Mr Smithson said. The survey also found that 8,000 independent artists, contractors and arts administrators were at risk of losing their jobs. The peak industry group played a significant role in helping to develop the careers of young musicians in the state. Perth-based singer songwriter Michael Dunstan has frequently toured Australia and regional WA in the past and ordinarily visits Esperance, Albany, Margaret River, Exmouth and his hometown of Northam. But for the first time the 26-year-old has been unable to financially sustain himself through music and was forced to put his career on hold to work full-time in retail. ""Working hard isn't a problem, I just feel like with music it works towards something that brings me a lot of meaning and purpose in life,"" he said. ""I do get to the end of some days and feel a bit depressed to be honest."" The survey found 58 per cent of respondents had experienced mental health issues over the past two years and 91 per cent of organisations were concerned about the wellbeing of staff and volunteers. Mr Dunstan said the statistics did not surprise him. ""I have so many friends in the music industry and I know how kind of soul crushing it is, and soul crushing is the way to put it,"" he said. In the Goldfields, Stage Left Theatre Troupe is a volunteer-run not-for-profit that operates out of a quaint old building in Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Stage Left's vice president Kylie Ward said the most recent restrictions and audience hesitancy had forced them to cancel their first show of the year. ""We could only sell [tickets to] 50 per cent of our audience anyway and then we had very few pre-sales,"" she said. Ms Ward said they had not been eligible for many government grants and they relied on ticket sales to pay for shows, which cost up to $7,000. Most of us know someone who has managed to dodge catching COVID-19, despite being in a household with people who are sick. What makes some of us more resistant than others? ""We're not commercial and we're small so usually bigger groups like the big art centres are eligible for the funding, whereas smaller community-run ones, it's a bit harder to try and access some of the relief funding,"" she said. Like Mr Smithson, cancellations had also forced the theatre to dip into reserves to keep up with bills and building maintenance. ""It's going to be a very tight year,"" Ms Ward said. Ms Jameson said the chamber had presented the survey to WA's Minister for Arts and Culture, David Templeman and asked for an immediate $30 million recovery package to help small organisations that cannot access financial support. ""We're also calling on local governments to support their local arts organisations,"" she said. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The chamber also asked for $23 million for a long-term recovery program and $5 million to support sole traders and artists. A statement from the minister's office said the state government had provided several grants this year for community groups, independent artists and organisations. Want more local news?

216,‘Free colony’s’ history of slavery and environmental degradation interrogated in new exhibition,arts-culture,"  Art Gallery of South Australia’s Adelaide Biennial exhibition interrogates South Australia’s history of slavery, environmental degradation Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog To get in the door of the Art Gallery of South Australia (AGSA), visitors typically pass through the colonnaded portico on North Terrace — which is currently hung with a series of vertical banners, patterned in emergency-orange, turquoise and royal-blue geometric shapes. The effect is ambiguous: is this a beacon, or a warning? The orange parts of the banners are made from 'storm sails', explains curator Sebastian Goldspink, helming AGSA's 2022 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art. ""All big yachts carry storm sails. And while they're not really an effective sail for day-to-day use, in storms they're very rigid, and they will get you out of trouble; they're almost like a lifejacket,"" Goldspink explains. ""But they're also a signal to other boats around you that you're in trouble."" The banners are the work of Warrang/Sydney artist Kate Scardifield, who has titled the work ALARUM — after the Elizabethan-era stage direction indicating a state of disarray (""Like in Shakespeare, when the scene sort of starts in panic,"" says Goldspink). It's a beacon, and a warning — and an analogue for Goldspink's belief that in times of trouble, artists must hold steady; stay the course. Be our guides. The Sydney-based curator, descended from the Burramattagal people, has chosen 25 artists from around the country to do just that, as part of his edition of the Adelaide Biennial, subtitled ""Free/State"". ""Free/State"" is a deliberately slippery theme that Goldspink intended to be a provocation more than a prescription. While it was inspired by his interest in history — specifically, the history of South Australia as a so-called ""free colony"" — it also nods to states of being and psychology, and different notions of freedom. The works in the exhibition explore social and family history, colonisation, life in lockdown, incarceration, freedom of expression and its consequences, freedom of choice, spiritualism and the state of climate emergency. Goldspink says he knew from the get-go that he didn't want to make a Biennial about COVID; but inevitably, given the topic and the fact that most of the works were created during the pandemic, lockdown life is a subject within the exhibition. Naarm/Melbourne artist Shaun Gladwell stars in his 21-minute video work Key Strikes, riding a BMX in one sequence and climbing (and hanging upside down from) a monument in another. Taking place in the urban environment and occasionally in the virtual realm of Grand Theft Auto, Gladwell's video cycles through various chapters of lockdown life in public space, including CLIMBING, SEEING, DRINKING (people drink from public water fountains) and DANCING (lo-fi footage of a street dancer). Elsewhere in the gallery, Warrang/Sydney artist JD Reformer has transcribed eight of his daily lockdown runs into fragments of neon tubing affixed to the ceiling and walls. A framed map nearby demarcates the precise 5-kilometre-radius zone of his 'confinement'. ""I run as exercise generally, and then during the lockdown that parameter of the 5 kilometre radius around where I live became a performance boundary, in a way,"" says the artist. On the opposite wall, a life-size photograph of Reforma running through a rigidly-plotted glade of gumtrees in south-west Sydney (back in 2013) feels like a portal to freedom while simultaneously heightening the sense of our confinement in a subterranean gallery. There's a sense of 'busting out' of institutional constraints in the show's opening stretch, which leads visitors who enter through the building's front entrance through the gallery's Elder Wing: a bastion of late-19th-century classical architecture. A series of large, bright, paintings by Warrang/Sydney artist Tom Polo greet viewers as they cross the threshold into the Elder Wing: they're not on the walls, but installed within the gallery space on support structures, so that they resemble 'theatre flats'. Polo worked with AGSA curators to position his paintings (and the misshapen, abstracted figures within them) in relation to other works on display within the Elder Wing — 'disturbing the peace' so to speak, but in a productive way that encourages you to look at the collection and gallery space with fresh eyes. Nearby, Pitjantjatjara artist Rhoda Tjitayi has painted her grandmother's tjukurpa (story) directly onto the walls, alongside a hand-painted greeting: ""Come in. What do you see, hear and feel? Right now you're in my grandmother's country."" ""She had never been to the Art Gallery of South Australia [before this],"" Goldspink marvels. ""Her studio is a few hundred metres away. [But] she just never felt she could come."" Also in the opening room of the exhibition is Ukrainian-Australian artist Stanislava Pinchuk's installation The Wine Dark Sea (titled after a phrase from Homer's Odyssey): a meditation on the refugee experience that's impact is heightened by the current Ukraine-Russian conflict. Pinchuk was born and raised in the city of Kharkiv before migrating to Australia aged 10, and has been 'mapping' the impact of conflict in that country (and others) through her arts practice, since the escalation of Russian aggression in late 2013 and early 2014. For the Biennial, she worked with a grave-maker to inscribe marble offcuts with lines from both the Odyssey and leaked cables detailing refugee experiences in Australia's offshore detention facilities in Manus and Nauru. The similarity in lines from these ostensibly disparate texts inspired her to 'prank' the audience: each line is falsely attributed to the alternate source. ""So everywhere that you read Odysseus or the Cyclops, Telemachus, Penelope — it is actually a line from Nauru. And everywhere that you read 'redacted' is actually a line from The Odyssey,"" she explains. Pinchuk describes Homer's epic poem as ""the original quote-unquote migrant novel"". ""[Odysseus] goes from island to island to island because he was given no answer about when he may go home. At its core — for me — [the poem] is about the idea of hospitality and how we treat our fellow man; how do we treat our guests? And what does that say about us?"" she says. ""[My artwork] was kind of very much about interrogating what narratives we accept as the foundations of Western literature and what we refuse to publish or to talk about, to acknowledge."" On December 28 of 1836, freshly-appointed Governor John Hindmarsh officially declared the commencement of government for the ""free colony"" of South Australia: not a penal colony (like New South Wales) but a colony of free men. In the same address, Hindmarsh declared that the laws of this new, free state would apply equally to its ""native population"". This (misguided) 'ideal' was the leaping off point for Goldspink's conception of his Biennial. Two of the works deal explicitly with the broken promise and hypocrisy at the heart of South Australia's treatment of First Peoples and Country. Partners and collaborators James Tylor and Rebecca Selleck draw on his Kaurna heritage and family history in their installation, which explores South Australia's history of slavery. ""They used Aboriginal people [on the missions] as unpaid servants, for food and lodging, which is slavery … and they were [also] getting trained up at the missions to then go and work as unpaid servants on farms,"" Tylor explains. Tylor and Selleck's installation, titled Warpulyainthi (Colonial Slavery in South Australia), comprises carved furniture, photographic prints and bronze-cast flora and fauna, to create an eerie, period-ambiguous 'colonial' kitchen space — complete with a butter churn, onion and potato bin, flour trough, food safe and kitchen table carved from blue gum. ""[The furniture blends] a Georgian-esque style to a modernist style, which is the time frame that servitude happened in; going from colonialism in the 19th century all the way through to the 1950s, when Aboriginal people were still unpaid servants,"" says Tylor — noting that it is all ""lower class furniture"". ""My great-great-grandmother was a servant … but most Aboriginal families have some relationship either to the missions, or to servitude,"" he adds. A dead kangaroo joey is laid out on a bench seat at the kitchen table, which is strewn with bronze-cast versions of Kaurna staples (oysters, mullet, saltbush, warrigal greens, samphire) that were ultimately endangered by colonial land management. Underneath the table, a handful of quandong seeds lay spilled, like marbles. ""If we were to go back in time 250 years, there would be an abundance of different plants and animals. But today, it's [limited to] what survived through urbanisation [and] monocultural farming,"" says Selleck. For the artists, the artworks represent both loss and endurance; what remains is evidenced by the installation itself — including the flora and fauna, and the engraved patterns on furniture and photo prints, which represent a Kaurna body design specific to the northern plains (the kuri pattern). There is a poetic justice to presenting the work in an institution like the Art Gallery of South Australia, which sits on a strip of heritage architecture that must have been funded, at least in part, by slave labour (in the form of donations from pastoralists, in an era where unpaid Aboriginal labour on farms was commonplace). South Australian artist Sera Waters also explores the lie of the 'free state' in her work for the Biennial: a textile installation called Storied Sail Cloths, comprising a series of embroidered landscapes on sail-cloth, arranged in a sail formation on the walls of AGSA. Waters comes from five generations of settler-colonists stretching back to 1838, when her ancestors, sail-makers, came to South Australia. Her practice as an artist draws on this family history as well as traditional British needle-work techniques, to reckon with the impacts of colonisation. For the Adelaide Biennial, she examines the colonial mismanagement of land and environment in various regions of South Australia. One embroidered 'sail' depicts Port Adelaide and the destruction of oyster beds to create mortar for colonial construction; another looks at wetlands in the south-east that were drained to create pastoral land; yet another looks at mining. ""My ancestors came [to South Australia] seeking freedom, seeking new opportunities for their family — and they took freely of minerals and land,"" says Waters. ""I'm asking, as that generation who inherited their legacies — a lot of a lot of damage, a lot of waste buried under areas that we still live with the repercussions of — how do we take responsibility? How do we acknowledge what's happened, and then start to change?"" Early in her career, Waters won a scholarship to study hand-embroidery at the Royal School of Needlework in the UK, and she uses methods such as white work and black work, and French and colonial knots, in her work. ""I'm thinking [about] how can we use those old skills to rethink our future?"" she explains. ""I often go back to knots, because I think we can't actually untangle what's happened; things have changed too much. So we have to acknowledge that we live with all of these knots and tangles — [and] even though we can't undo them, we can trace them to see all the threads that make up that knot, to understand how it came about, so that maybe we can change our our behaviours into the future."" Against the backdrop of historical and ongoing colonisation, several works in the Biennial assert First Peoples sovereignty and identity, and 'reclaim' territory. Naarm/Melbourne artist Reko Rennie's video works OA_RR (2016-17) and Initiation OA_RR (2021) take centre stage in the downstairs gallery of AGSA. In the first, he makes a return trip to ancestral Kamilaroi/Gamilaroi/Gamilaraay Country in a custom-painted Rolls Royce, to enact a contemporary ceremony of burn-out rings in the red dirt; in the second, he voyages through the dockside suburbs of Naarm/Melbourne's west in a hot-pink-metallic Monaro coupe, to enact a similar ritual on the bitumen. The dramatic soundtrack (alternating between Nick Cave and Warren Ellis's Higgs Boson Blues for the earlier work, and an aria by soprano Deborah Cheetham for the later work) permeates most gallery spaces on that level — giving Rennie's artworks an outsized presence. Around the corner, Worimi artist Dean Cross interrogates bureaucracy, cartography and boundary-making as instruments of colonisation, and their role in carving up ""this sort of pre-contact 'free state'"" — or ""one big paddock"" — that is now called Australia. His installation gunalgunal (contracted field) has been created on a free-standing double-walled structure with an exposed inner cavity and a doorway carved into it, through which the viewer must pass to fully experience the work. Over one wall is layered a large-scale reproduction of Théodore Géricault's epic 1819 painting The Raft of the Medusa (depicting a real-life colonial catastrophe of shipwreck and cannibalism on the slave route); and a version of the 1974 map of Australia devised by white anthropologist Norman Tindale, in which he demarcated the ""Tribal Boundaries in Aboriginal Australia"" — though in Cross's version, Tindale's boundaries have been erased. The wall on the other side of the structure features a patterned arrangement of 25 iron star-picket fence posts (used to demarcate boundaries across this continent), each slightly bent so that they look like boomerangs. The combined length of the posts, Cross points out, is 81 metres: the height of the flagpole topping Parliament House in Canberra. As you walk through the doorway between the walls, the in-between cavity is exposed so that you can see the rough inner construction: plywood support structures, fencing wire. The mess and guts of the colonial construct, perhaps. Fencing is reclaimed in Warrang/Sydney artist Dennis Golding's work, too: a giant 'chandelier' made from panels of Victorian-style cast-iron fencing of the kind found in the terrace-fronts of Redfern — where Golding grew up. Golding draws on the story of his family and of Aboriginal families more generally; his grandparents moved from their respective towns in northern New South Wales to Redfern in the 70s, ""when they heard that Redfern was emerging as a community,"" he says. The orange light cast by the chandelier evokes the street lights that he remembers as a ""cue to run home"" in the evenings; the iron-lace panels recall those on his grandmother's house in Eveleigh Street as well as those on the terrace front of the Settlement — a community hub where he and other children hung out in the 90s. Crucial to Golding's process is that he casts the panels in epoxy resin — rather than using found objects; it speaks to the symbolic re-casting of a Western style of architecture as an Aboriginal contemporary architecture. Mounted on the wall behind his chandelier is a ceramic ""shield"" that reinterprets the floral motifs and ornate design of the terrace panels. ""I've tried to use the objects to really shift its function as a fence,"" says Golding. ""Fences are a barrier to our land and people, and they talk about occupation, land claiming. And so I'm turning all of the fences upside down, installing them in the shape of a chandelier and putting light in the centre [to make something] that talks about how we can shed light onto these experiences.""

217,Cruise ships are finally returning to Australia and Jodie 'can't wait to get back on board',arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Sydney mother of three Jodie Paulin has $20,000 worth of cruise holidays planned for her family when the local industry restarts after a two-year pandemic shutdown. Cruise ships are set to return to Australia from Sunday, after being banned from entering Australian waters in March 2020 to curb the spread of the coronavirus. International cruise ships will be allowed back in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. The three states have announced COVID protocols, including full vaccination and testing for passengers, and a mask mandate for customers and crew when boarding and leaving the ship. Western Australia and Northern Territory are allowing smaller ships to visit their ports, and Tasmania and South Australia have yet to announce their plans. The Pacific Explorer, owned by cruise giant Carnival Corporation, will be the first international ship to sail into Sydney Harbour when the ban is lifted on April 17. Ms Paulin is getting ready to sail on the ship when it departs for its first voyage, a return trip from Sydney to Brisbane at the end of May. ""It's just going to be the biggest celebration, isn't it? I can't wait to get back on board,"" she said. Ms Paulin works two jobs so she can take her family on cruises, and she has been eagerly waiting for the travel ban to end. ""I go down to Circular Quay and I look at where the cruise ships are normally parked, and it's really sad,"" Ms Paulin told the ABC. Ms Paulin is not put off by COVID-19 outbreaks on cruise ships, including on Carnival Cruise's Ruby Princess in March 2020, which left nearly 30 people dead and more than 600 people infected. ""I'm worried about getting COVID at my local supermarket,"" she said. ""I'm no more worried about getting COVID on a cruise than I am going down to my local shopping centre."" The pandemic shut down the global tourism industry, including cruise operations, an industry worth more than $154 billion, in 2019. Half a million jobs were lost in the industry from March to September 2020, because of coronavirus lockdowns and restrictions, with a $77 billion hit to the global economy, according to industry body Cruise Lines International Association. CLIA Australasia said Australia's cruise ban caused a $10 billion economic hit locally and affected more than 18,000 direct and indirect jobs. Before the pandemic, spending by cruise ship passengers in Australia was worth $1.4 billion annually, and Australia was one of the world's top cruise markets, with up to 1.3 million people taking a cruise each year. CLIA managing director Joel Katz thinks the cruise ban should have been lifted earlier, as it was in other markets, such as Europe, the United States and parts of Asia and the Pacific. ""Before COVID, the industry was contributing more than $5 billion to the economy each year, and that's the travel agents, the tour operators, the food and beverage suppliers, the hotel and accommodation sector, transport providers and, of course, the thousands of businesses in ports and destinations right around the country that rely on the cruise industry,"" Mr Katz said. Travel agent Belle Goldie had to close her travel agency and take a retail job when the pandemic struck and business dried up in 2020. ""I had a commercial property with staff a couple of days a week. Overnight, I realised that this was serious, a serious financial thing for me as well, because I put all of my family's money into my new business,"" Ms Goldie said. ""And I worked on more than 1,200 client bookings on my own around the clock."" Ms Goldie has reopened her travel agency in Western Sydney, and she said there had been a surge in demand for cruise bookings. ""People are almost revenge booking,"" she said. ""They are booking for last minute, kind of May, June, July. ""They're booking, you know, quite soon to travel, whereas cruising typically in the past has been an up to an eight-month lead time, people are booking multiple cruises now."" Ms Goldie is also taking the Pacific Explorer Sydney-to-Brisbane return trip. And she is ecstatic that cruises are back after two long years. ""I can't put it into words, if you ask me what it feels like. I would ask you what water tastes like,"" she said. ""It's very emotional for me because I love to cruise, and I know how much Australians love to cruise. And we know the crew, they become like family to us."" The hard-hit arts and entertainment industry has also welcomed the return of cruises to Australia with many performers employed by major cruise companies. Dancer Amber-Jade Smith has just won the contract of a lifetime with cruise giant Royal Caribbean as Australia opens its doors. ""It's honestly a lifetime opportunity that I'm so happy to have achieved, and I'm so excited to travel the world as it's always been a dream of mine,"" Ms Smith told the ABC. The 18-year-old performer is one of 9,356 people employed full-time here by cruise ships. Royal Caribbean will set sail from Australia in late October. Ms Smith said because she was fully vaccinated she felt less concerned about catching COVID-19. She said the chance to work on a cruise ship as a performer would help young people get a start in the arts industry. ""We've been waiting for this for ages, especially young dancers like me,"" she said. ""We've been holding back from things like this because we haven't had the opportunity."" Overseas, cruises have been operating since mid-2020 with new COVID safety measures, including requirements for passengers to be fully vaccinated and wear masks on board if they can't socially distance. More than 80 countries have resumed cruising, with Australia one of the last major markets to set sail. Mr Katz said the industry took safety seriously. ""The whole journey from the moment the passenger makes the booking, communications, pre-cruising testing, vaccination in order to get on board, and of course, all the public health measures you'd expect to find when you are on the ship,"" he said. However, the measures have not stopped outbreaks on ships, including a recent outbreak on the Ruby Princess, which is now sailing in the US. Major cruise lines like Carnival Corporation and Royal Caribbean are seeing record bookings. However, they have also forecast more losses this year because of higher fuel prices from the war in Ukraine, and the spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus. Professor Tim Harcourt, chief economist at the University of Technology Sydney,  said there were a lot of challenges facing the industry, including an ageing clientele. ""I'd say COVID and the wash-up, the environment, climate change, and the future demographics of the industry,"" he said. ""A cruise ship is not like an airplane....you can run flights below capacity and still make money. ""Cruise ships, you have to fill them. They're like a sports stadium. ""And once you get people on the boat, you've got a captive audience and they make a lot of money, of course — across-the-counter gambling, drinking, entertaining and so on."" He said the threat from the coronavirus was not over yet, although the cruise industry was trying to take as many precautions as they could. ""You can get it anywhere, sure, but it's a concentrated group of people,"" he said. ""It's hard to do the tyranny of social distance if you like, so it's going to spread pretty quickly."" And not everyone is celebrating the return of international cruise ships to Australia. The ABC spoke to Evie Apfelbaum and Ruth Poger, who were visiting the observation deck of the currently closed Overseas Passenger Terminal in Sydney, where cruise ships arrived and departed. Ms Poger said she had no desire to go on a cruise ship because she was frightened of contracting the virus. ""That at the moment would be the number one reason why I wouldn't go on a cruise ship,"" she said ""I would say floating incubators, that's exactly how I would see them at the moment.""

218,Love Me Tender: How Elvis is helping Kelly bond with her premature daughter,arts-culture,"  How music therapy and Elvis are helping Kelly to bond with her premature baby daughter Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Since her newborn daughter ""decided to arrive into this world 11 weeks early"", Kelly Bint says her days have been an overwhelming mix of emotions. ""Little Lara"" has been cared for at Gold Coast University Hospital's newborn intensive care unit for about six weeks in what Ms Bint has described as ""a completely scary but reassuring journey"". ""To have to spend so much time in here has been a little stressful, a little bit anxious, but we've been really reassured by the staff,"" she said. ""The days are long in there and often they can be really lonely."" But with Ms Bint unable to hold Lara as much as a typical newborn, she has turned to an unlikely ally to help her form a bond: Elvis. Tim Minchin has been a qualified music therapist for years and has been working with newborns after securing funding through the Gold Coast University Hospital Foundation. ""Babies in the NICU and the special care nursery, a lot of them are hooked up to machines, hooked up to medical equipment, and it can be quite confronting for parents to be able even to engage with their child,"" he said. ""They might fear that their baby is too fragile, that they might hurt them by touching them, or that they don't want to touch the wrong thing, bump a machine."" Mr Minchin has been working with Kelly and Lara in one-on-one music therapy sessions. ""So the concept of music therapy was amazing because it allowed us to use words we already knew to fill that space with Lara in a really soothing manner,"" Ms Bint said. ""Tim will come in with his guitar and sit down, he'll take a quick assessment of Lara to see where she's at — where she's been in terms of sleeping, eating, settled, or unsettled. ""Then we just choose some tunes and off he goes with the guitar."" Every year around 300,000 babies are born in Australia. And while most arrive safely without complications, some have a more difficult journey into the world. Mr Minchin said music therapy could be used in many different formats, but specifically for newborns, helping to form bonds between parents and children under difficult circumstances like Lara's. ""It's a way for them to bond with their parents,"" he said. ""Babies become more relaxed, they become more settled. ""So a big part of what I do involves using music with mums and dads in skin-to-skin care, and supporting them to sing to their child in an environment that is quite medical and confronting."" Ms Bint said some songs worked better than others, but that she had found success in singing Love Me Tender by Elvis. ""She soothed straight away,"" Ms Bint said. ""You can sense just holding her, an automatic sense of relaxation and calm in her."" With Lara connected to monitors and medical equipment that ""bings and dings and alarms non-stop"", Ms Bint said the therapy gave them both time to relax. ""During a music session we can sit there calmly for half an hour and have no buzzers and bells,"" she said. ""The pitch of my voice, the sound of my voice and getting used to that, will definitely help us to connect at times where it's really difficult because we can't necessarily have skin-on-skin or touch all the time because of the incubator. ""It's been massive for us in terms of getting a connection and it'll be something we take home.""

219,"Many voices, one message: Musicians take a stand against racism, fear and division",arts-culture,"  Musicians take stand against racism, fear and division with song All One Under the Sun Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When you bring together a group of young musicians and singers from refugee, migrant, First Nations, and other backgrounds to sing and share stories, the results can be powerful. A NSW campaign to fight racism called All One Under the Sun, based on Gumbaynggirr Country at Coffs Harbour, has done just that, drawing together musically talented young people with very diverse backgrounds. Many of them have experienced racism and, through their shared experiences and talents, an uplifting song has been created, encouraging people to celebrate a cross-cultural society and stand against ""fear and division"". The song and a music video have just been launched, the culmination of the project that started in March 2021. Marko Kisose, a Congolese Australian who moved to Australia in 2011 from a Malawi refugee camp, was among those involved in the song's creation. ""There are many cultures involved … there's Congolese, Aboriginal Australians, there's Ethiopia, Iraq, Afghanistan and a few more [countries represented],"" he said. ""Meeting other musicians and hearing each other's experiences of racism has given me some encouragement, as racism is one of those things where you think it just happens to certain people. ""It opened my eyes and my mind to other people's perspectives, and what they have gone through, and it is powerful to put that into the music."" The project was started after the Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors (STARTTS) found young people from refugee backgrounds were affected by racism at school, work, and in the community. ""It's driven by young people and uses the arts to promote inclusion, belonging, connection, education, and empowerment,"" said All Under One Sun project coordinator, Naomi Steinborner. ""The project aims to develop a strong, connected community and resilience in the whole community to stand up to fear, hate, and division."" Workshops have been held in schools and young people aged 13 to 24 helped write the focal song, in collaboration with a local music-production company, Grow the Music. Gumbaynggirr cultural educator and artist Troy Robinson, Syrian-born singer and bouzouki player Ali Hassan, and First Nations hip hop artist Tory Paasi also collaborated in writing the song. ""We did a few workshops, it was more like jam sessions, everyone jamming, everyone would bring an idea and we would write things down and try to figure it out,"" Mr Kisose said. Mr Kisose said he hoped the song and video would reach many people. ""I play guitar in the song, and I sing the first verse which goes: ""Under the sun we're all the same here. We are all shining stars. The colour of my skin does not define me. Let's change the world and make it a better place. ""We are trying to send out the message to people that racism is not OK."" Orara High School student and aspiring singer Jaslyn Walker, of Gumbaynggirr/Yaegl/Bundjalung heritage, also took part. ""Through this project I got to meet a whole lot of different people, to understand where they are from and get to know them a bit more,"" she said. ""Everyone's life feels like a different story. The whole thing has been great to be part of, and I have felt my confidence grow."" Woolgoolga High School student Leevon Young, who is Australian born with German heritage, was involved as a guitarist and said it was an uplifting experience. ""All One Under the Sun captures the essence of community spirit and highlights how important music is in our diverse society,"" he said. A consortium of services has helped run the project, including STATTS, the Coffs Harbour and Districts Local Aboriginal Lands Council, headspace Coffs Harbour, Blue Sky Community Services, and Coffs Harbour City Council, with funding through Multicultural NSW. A two-part documentary about the project is also underway. The project is the latest positive chapter in Mr Kisose's life in Australia. ""It was a massive, massive change to come to Australia. At the start it was a bit scary, because everything was new and nearly everyone was new,"" he said. ""But I got used to it and the routine and everything started becoming normal in a way and life changed."" Mr Kisose has lived in Coffs Harbour for the past eight years. ""People around me in the community are really supportive and they have helped me a lot, not only musically but with my journey and my life and I am really grateful for it,"" he said.

220,This uni student threw out the jigsaw rulebook to become the best puzzler in her state,arts-culture,"  Australian Jigsaw Puzzle Association's WA winner Emma Telfer honed her skills as a child Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Emma Telfer won the recent West Australian State Jigsaw Puzzle Championship with her speedy assembly of 500-piece puzzles, she started in the centre, breaking the rules to finish in just one hour and 13 minutes. The 19-year-old university student had never entered a competition before but she had been doing jigsaw puzzles since she was a child, she told ABC Radio Perth. ""I started when I was little, because my sister used to do it, so naturally I copied her,"" Emma said. ""I just kind of did it whenever I was sick or bored, because I hated just watching something. I like to do something with my hands."" Another sister heard about the competition run by the Australian Jigsaw Puzzle Association and suggested she enter. The 500-piece puzzle designed specifically for the event featured four butterflies and a decorative border, and when she first saw it, Emma wasn't sure where to start. ""It's not what I expected. I'm used to scenery, and it was very different to stuff I'd usually done,"" she said. ""Usually I do [start with the edges]. ""But in this case, I didn't because I looked at it and I realised that all the edges were the same — they were the hardest part. ""So I actually started in the middle and did the outside last, because the butterflies were big block colours, and I was like, 'Oh, that's definitely the easiest part'."" During the course of the competition, she had no idea if she was doing well or not. ""Everybody around me had done the outside first,"" Emma said. ""And everyone was just flipping all the pieces over and I don't do that, I just like to flick through the pieces with my fingers."" It wasn't until she was close to finishing and noticed officials hovering closely around her that she realised things were going well. She finished with a time of one hour, 13 minutes and 27 seconds — a few minutes ahead of the second-place winner. The Australian Jigsaw Puzzle Association was founded by Perth-based D'Arne Healy, a jigsaw devotee who wanted to take her puzzling to a higher level. ""I wanted to do a jigsaw puzzle race myself, I wanted to know if I actually was a fast puzzler or not,"" she said. ""The only way to find out is to race against somebody. ""I couldn't find any puzzle races in Australia. I knew there were some in America and Belgium and Spain. ""I ended up going to one in Spain, which happened to be the world championships."" When she got home, she decided to set up the association and started to run competitions in capital cities around Australia. The concept has been very popular. A competition in Melbourne on April 9 and 10 attracted about 300 people, across both individual and pair events. Because the association was founded in December 2019, D'Arne can't tell whether the pandemic accelerated interest in jigsaw puzzling. ""It's hard to tell because we didn't have this available to us before COVID, so we actually don't have anything to compare to,"" she said. ""We know that jigsaw puzzle sales [have gone] through the roof since COVID."" Participants were only shown the puzzle when the competition started. They could use the box cover for reference and have three hours to complete a 500-piece puzzle. If a contestant doesn't finish in three hours, the number of pieces they have left are counted and this is used to create their ranking in the competition. For people who are keen to up their jigsaw speeds, D'Arne says they should practice often, flip fast, and don't spend too much time sorting. ""For practice, I would say get your hands moving really fast, flip those pieces over as quick as you can,"" she said. ""I see so many people are used to sorting their puzzles a lot, but a 500-piece puzzle doesn't require as much sorting."" For D'Arne, who has been doing jigsaws for as long as she can remember, the enjoyment of jigsaws wasn't marred by trying to work at speed. ""I find it extremely relaxing, even when I'm timing myself I still don't find it stressful,"" she said. ""Puzzling is just so relaxing, it's a form of meditation for me.""

221,"Can you buy style? Yes, but it has little to do with famous brands",arts-culture,"  Do you shop for second-hand clothes? You're likely to be more stylish Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Not only is second-hand shopping good for the planet and your wallet, our new research finds the more style-conscious you are, the more likely you are to shop for second-hand clothes and accessories. In the 2020-21 financial year, 72 per cent of Australians purchased at least one item of second-hand clothes — but we wanted to know more about people who were shopping second hand. It is often assumed those who shop for second-hand clothes do so to save money or reduce their impact on the environment. In our study, we found the higher people rate on style-consciousness, the more likely they are to shop second hand. In fact, style-consciousness was a bigger predictor of second-hand shopping than being frugal or ecologically-conscious. Style-conscious shoppers are very different from fashion-conscious shoppers. Fashion is all about the ""new"": fashion is a novelty and constantly evolving. Style, on the other hand, is about expressing long-term individual identity. Fashion shoppers are used to a continuous supply of new trends and ""fast fashion"" products. Fast fashion works quickly to replicate an ever moving stream of fashion trends, generating large volumes of low-quality apparel. The impact of fast fashion on the environment is significant and well-documented. Globally, the fast fashion industry creates 92 million tonnes of waste per year and uses 79 trillion litres of water. Less than 15 per cent of clothes are recycled or reused. Poorly made and low-quality fast fashion items are a significant problem for charity stores, who are forced to send fast fashion items they can't sell to landfill. But, going against this fast fashion trend, growing numbers of people are shopping for second-hand clothing and accessories. It's difficult to determine the size of the second-hand market because many sales take place in informal settings such as pre-loved markets and online platforms like Facebook Marketplace. However, sales data from online platforms shows an explosion in growth. James Reinhart, CEO of online second-hand fashion retailer Thredup, has predicted the global second-hand market will double in the next five years to US$77 billion (A$102 billion). He also predicts the second-hand market will be double the size of fast fashion by 2030. Younger shoppers are driving growth in popularity of second-hand shopping, especially via online platforms. Our research suggests much of this growth is due to shoppers considering themselves to be style-conscious. We surveyed 515 Australian female-identifying consumers looking at their ""orientation"" (the preference to behave in a certain way) when it comes to shopping. Each participant was measured for their orientation towards frugality, how ecologically conscious they are, their level of materialism, how prone they are towards nostalgia, their fashion-consciousness and their style-consciousness. While we found there are frugal and ecologically-conscious second-hand shoppers, our research revealed overwhelmingly that style-consciousness is the greatest predictor of second-hand fashion shopping. Op shops are now a fashion fixture, but it's taken almost 100 years for them to shake their stigma. People who scored highly on the style-consciousness scale were more likely to shop for second-hand clothes than any of the other orientations. A style-conscious person expresses themselves through their clothes. These shoppers want clothes that complement their personal style and values. They look for authentic and original pieces and avoid mainstream trends and fast fashion. Style-conscious shoppers buy high-quality, durable clothing and accessories. While fashion-conscious shoppers are constantly buying new clothes to keep up with current trends, style-conscious shoppers buy clothes that are timeless, well-crafted and allow them to express their individual identity over the long-term. Traditional thrift shops run by charities are responding to consumer demand, reinventing their stores with carefully selected, high-quality clothes, improved merchandising and store design, online sales and improved digital and social media marketing. The number of independently owned, highly-curated ""pre-loved"" stores and online sales platforms is also increasing. Social media influencers have driven much of this growth. Their accounts embrace second-hand fashion, the circular economy (which highlights reuse, repair, repurpose and recycle) and promote the notion of #secondhandfirst. We hope with increasing numbers of second-hand stores, markets and online platforms selling a range of quality, pre-loved clothes at different price points for different budgets — coupled with the growing acceptance of second-hand shopping — shoppers will consider buying second-hand more often. For those who already embrace ""not needing new"", not only are you helping the planet — our research shows you are also likely to be doing it with style.

223,"Daniel Johns could face jail over drink-driving crash, magistrate says",arts-culture,"  Daniel Johns could face jail over drink-driving crash near Newcastle, court told Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A magistrate has warned former Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns that he could face jail after pleading guilty to a high-range drink-driving charge. Johns recorded a blood-alcohol reading more than three times the legal limit after a car crash near Newcastle last month. The singer is undergoing a three-month rehab program and did not appear at Raymond Terrace Local Court on Monday. Johns was charged after his car crossed to the wrong side of the Pacific Highway at North Arm Cove and collided with a van on March 23. The 42-year-old took to social media to explain he had been suffering panic attacks and had been self medicating. ""As you know my mental health is a work in progress,"" he told his followers. Johns was represented in court by high-profile lawyer Bryan Wrench who entered a guilty plea on his behalf and indicated his client's desire to expedite proceedings. The court was presented with lengthy documentation around the singer's battle with depression and other health issues, as well as a commitment by family members to ensure any conditions set by the court would be followed. Due to the serious nature of the offence, Magistrate Ian Cheetham warned that Johns faced the prospect of a custodial sentence. A sentencing hearing was set for June 22.

224,"Pioneering punk Chris Bailey, who helmed Aussie legends The Saints, dead",arts-culture,"  Chris Bailey, lead singer of The Saints and 'co-creator of punk', dies Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Chris Bailey, lead singer of legendary rock band The Saints, has died. The Australian band announced the singer and songwriter's death on social media on Monday morning, referencing the band's most famous song. ""It is with great pain in our hearts that we have to inform you about the passing of Chris Bailey, singer and songwriter of The Saints, on April the 9th, 2022,"" the statement said. ""Chris lived a life of poetry and music and stranded on a Saturday night."" Bailey, who was born in 1957, co-founded the Brisbane band in 1973 with guitarist Ed Kuepper and drummer Ivor Hay after they met at school. The band came to prominence in 1976 with their single (I'm) Stranded, about growing up in Brisbane. On social media, Kuepper reflected on the loss of his friend. ""Chris and I met when we were about 14 during detention at Oxley High School and became close friends which later developed into what I always thought was an extremely strong artistic partnership,"" he said. ""I couldn't have hoped for a better singer. My deepest condolences to his wife Elisabet, his sisters Margaret, Carol and Maureen and the rest of his family and loved ones."" Listed as one of the top 30 Australian songs of all time by APRA, (I'm) Stranded saw The Saints acclaimed as key figures in the burgeoning punk movement alongside bands like The Clash and Sex Pistols. The Saints were inducted into the ARIA Hall Of Fame in 2001. Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan paid tribute to Bailey on Monday, sharing lyrics from The Saints song No, Your Product. ""Rest in peace Chris Bailey. Twenty-one years is a long, long time to be in this prison when there ain't no crime. Saints forever,"" McKagan wrote on Twitter. Australian rock guitarist Lindsay McDougall, from punk band Frenzal Rhomb, described Bailey as a ""co-creator of punk music"". Musician and Cold Chisel frontman Jimmy Barnes said Bailey and The Saints ""were punks before punk"". ""One of the greatest songwriters this country produced has passed away,"" he wrote. ""He was a master of words and helped tell our story."" Rob Younger of Sydney punk group Radio Birdman wrote: ""Chris was a remarkable talent and a most unique individual. ""Chris and I shared many a laugh over the years and I'll miss him. ""Music lovers the world over will feel his loss deeply. Our commiserations go out to his family, friends and his many fans."" Writing on Twitter, musician Warren Ellis of Dirty Three and Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds described Bailey as ""one of the best singers"" and The Saints as ""one of the best bands"".

225,Brisbane lawyer's plan to restore derelict heritage home to former glory,arts-culture,"  Heritage-listed Brisbane home Dovercourt to get new lease of life Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Perched high on a hill and peering down towards the lights of the CBD, a piece of Brisbane's grand history is being slowly brought back to life as a family home. The 1860s-era, heritage-listed, brick house Dovercourt has long presided over Toowong's Sherwood Road as one of Brisbane's great mansions. But over the years, its white-painted brick walls have fallen into disrepair, verandahs have crumbled and sprawling gardens have become choked with weeds. Owned for generations by the Bigge family, two years ago Dovercourt was sold to Brisbane lawyer Kirsty Faichen, who took one look at the quietly crumbling house and fell in love. ""She's still beautiful and … has not had a lot done in terms of stripping out any of the original features,"" Ms Faichen said. ""So I'm very lucky to be able to restore those features, but also restore them from a point where they haven't really been altered or changed."" From Sherwood Road, little can be seen of Dovercourt, however passersby can catch a quick glimpse of the house's grand carriageway and front door, and a rusted roof behind a tall hedge. A little closer, from the circular carriageway — once surrounded by spectacular rose gardens — Dovercourt's full beauty emerges. A sweeping stairway up to wide timber verandahs with green and white wrought-iron railings, tall sash windows, and a massive, deep green door all hint at Dovercourt's former grandeur. Step inside the hallway, and immediately to your right sits the magnificent ballroom, divided by full-length timber trifold doors that, Ms Faichen said, were originally imported from Holland. Those doors separate the gentlemen's side, with a dark marble fireplace and timber walls, from the ladies' sitting room which features a white marble fireplace and chandelier. Gilt-edged mirrors sit over the two fireplaces, while ornate hand-crafted plaster architraves edge the sash windows. To the left of the main door are the bedrooms, in darker timber trim with colourful walls reaching to tall ceilings. The back rooms are a higgledy-piggledy warren of kitchens and servants rooms while downstairs, cut into deep rock, lie servants' quarters and cellars full of dusty relics. Built by English architect William Henry Ellerker in 1867, Dovercourt was auctioned as a four-room ""cottage"" with a detached kitchen and servant's room, a three-stalled stable, coach house, corn room and fowl house. Home to dozens of Brisbane's upper-crust families over the decades, the house was also used as a school, before being sold to the Bigge family, who lived in it for generations. Now, gilt mirrors and chandeliers rub shoulders with schoolbooks and modern furniture, and a trampoline sits where roses once grew, as Ms Faichen and her two daughters make Dovercourt their own. ""The intention is this will be my family home, and that the girls will enjoy it as they grow up here and we'll spend a lot of time playing cards, playing Monopoly, doing all the things we enjoy doing,"" Ms Faichen said. ""They will have amazing memories, including of the restoration process itself, because they're old enough to follow that and understand that."" First, though, she must secure the funds to complete a complex and costly restoration. When the house first came onto the market in 2020, locals were concerned that the tree-covered, 7,000 square metre lot would be snapped up by developers, prompting calls for Brisbane City Council to buy the property. From the house, the block falls rapidly away into a steep gully overgrown with weeds and creeper-covered trees. That steep block has been subdivided, the sale of which will fund Dovercourt's renovations. Ms Faichen says five houses on 500sq m blocks will be built there — a development those locals aren't happy about. ""If I didn't have to do it I wouldn't, but in terms of funding the housing restoration and really focusing on the handcrafts, that's what is most important to me,"" Ms Faichen said. ""From the road it very much looks just like one tiny white house, but it's actually a ginormous project, and I don't think it's understood that it's quite as big a project as it actually is."" Dovercourt itself will still sit proudly on the remaining 4,000 square metres, with the townhouses planned to be well away from the residence. Ms Faichen's planned restorations have sparked strong interest from locals, with notes regularly dropped into her letterbox and visitors knocking on her door to share their own memories of Dovercourt. At first, she said, the interest was ""quite confronting"", but now she is used to it. The entire south-side verandah must be repaired as it leans precariously out from the solid brick walls, while plumbing and haphazard electrics must be reinstalled. The leaking roof, too, needs extensive repairs before months of work can begin indoors, where cracks are widening in the ceilings, and original wallpaper hangs in strips off the ballroom walls. But none of that has deterred Ms Faichen, planning Dovercourt's next chapter. ""Sometimes if I'm here by myself I'll sit here and wonder just how many stories it can tell,"" Ms Faichen said. ""I know that's a bit of a cliché, but you look at the chandelier and think, how many things has that chandelier seen in its time.""

226,Rising Darwin actor Javier Jones turns international heads in first-ever performance ,arts-culture,"  Young NT actor Javier Jones turns international heads for debut performance in Mungo Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Rising Northern Territory actor Javier Jones likes that his friends at school don't pay much attention to the fact that he has made it to the big screen. ""I'm glad that they don't take notice of it all that much,"" he said. ""I don't want to get weird treatment, I just want to be treated normally."" The 12-year-old Larrakia boy plays the lead role in the Australian short-film Mungo, which tells the true story of an Aboriginal boy who leaves his family behind to join the circus in 1853. The film was shot in Tamworth in 2021 when Javier was just 10 years old. While he had never been to an acting class before landing the role, he said his performance as Mungo came naturally. ""I think we are both really alike because I have always been that kid at the back of the line, lagging, off with the fairies and I'm very curious like Mungo,"" he said. Javier's mother, Alicia Jones, said her son couldn't believe his luck when he was chosen for the leading role, after being spotted on a casting website. ""It was a very proud moment for him, he was quietly very proud of himself,"" she said. The film's director, Leonie Kelly, said she was drawn to Javier from the moment they met, and was blown away by his performance on set. ""Javier was able to perform in a way that I was asking for and was quite adaptable to be able to learn how to speak the Gamilaraay language for the film,"" she said. The Larrakia boy has gone on to win to two best actor awards for his performance in the film, in New York and Paris, and is keen to take his acting further. ""I'm most proud of the only thing I've done so far, and I hope it's not my last,"" he said Mungo is now making the film-festival circuit in Australia and around the globe, with a local screening in Darwin planned later this year. The year 7 student said he looks to other Northern Territory-born stars including actor Rob Collins and fashion designer Paul McCann for inspiration, and hopes to emulate their success, using Darwin as his launching pad. When he's not at school, Javier enjoys ""going down the track"" to camp with his family and swim in Top End waterholes. He believes being close to nature makes him a better actor. ""Everyone [here] is very much in touch with each other and in touch with nature and that's a great thing to have,"" he says. Javier said the only downfall about living in the Northern Territory was the lack of local acting opportunities but did not think that should stop other kids like him from chasing their dreams. ""You still should try and go for it, no matter what anyone tells you, even if people look down on you or say, 'you can't do that,"" he said. ""Ignore them because they are just jealous because you have got that talent."" This story is part of a special Born and Bred series, celebrating the work of remarkable Territorians.

228,'You feel guilty': COVID spread risk at arts events,arts-culture," Coronavirus Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Ersilia Tarantino hoped her 50-person event in regional Western Australia would be remembered as a celebration of the arts in Geraldton. Instead, a third of the attendees contracted COVID-19. Since the opening of the new collaborative art space last Friday, at least 15 known attendees — including Ms Tarantino and her partner — have tested positive to the virus. Despite following all recommended state government guidelines and asking patrons to check in and present vaccination certificates, she said she was feeling a sense of guilt. ""Although people take their own risks to come to an event, you feel guilty that it's your event they caught it at, even though you've done your best to keep people safe,"" she said. Ms Tarantino said, although it was important to keep celebrating community art, she would think twice before holding a similar-sized event in the near future. ""I would be more cautious about mask-wearing,"" she said. ""I maybe wouldn't have alcohol at the event, would think twice about having finger food, and I would also check that anyone didn't have any cold and flu symptoms. ""[But] I find that it is the connection between the people that keeps the community going, and the support amongst each other. ""It's a balance, isn't it?"" Sammy Jay, whose art was on display at the event, said she was incredibly disappointed to learn so many attendees contracted COVID. ""It feels really bad,"" she said. ""It's put a real downer on something I worked really hard for."" In the wake of the localised outbreak, another local event provider has pulled the pin and cancelled Tree Sets — an event held in Geraldton to showcase homegrown musicians that usually attracted about 100 people. Regional Sounds executive director Alexia Parenzee said tears were shed this week when the not-for-profit organisation made the decision to cancel. ""Lots and lots of volunteer hours went into producing that event,"" she said. ""Knowing there's been a bit of a spike in local COVID cases, we really felt that it was within everyone's best interest to postpone or cancel for now."" Ms Parenzee said it was an incredibly challenging time to organise events. ""We're just going to have conversations with the community and with our punters in the arts and music — individuals who make up our scene,"" she said. ""I just want to thank the community for backing events and those who buy tickets early even in such a crazy changing climate."" Organiser for the Musicians Australia section of the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance union Thomas Freeman said grassroots artists had been hit hard by the pandemic. ""They're small community arts events — like a showing at a local art gallery or a band playing at the pub — they're not bringing in huge numbers,"" he said. ""The uncertainty the pandemic has caused has led to lots of people dropping out of the industry because they just haven't been able to make a living."" As organisers weigh up the future of their events, member of the Midwest General Practitioner Network Ian Taylor urged people to continue to do everything they could to stop the spread. He said the localised outbreak in Geraldton could have been worse. ""It is likely — without masks and other rules — transmission would have been even worse,"" Dr Taylor said of the event. ""The reality is that unvaccinated people are way over-represented in hospitals and ICU in proportion to their numbers, and those figures speak for themselves in favour of vaccination.""

229,Julie 'starts with a name and finds a life' as she uncovers tales of smelter camp residents,arts-culture,"  Fremantle Smelter's Camp research uncovers strange, beautiful tales of homeless Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For decades until the 1950s, hundreds of itinerant workers, pensioners and migrants made homes for themselves in the dunes south of Fremantle, forming a community that became known as the Smelter's Camp. Filmmaker and researcher Julie Raffaele has researched the camp extensively discovering the names and stories of the people who called it home. The camp was ""basically a shanty town"" in several pockets in the area near South Beach and Woodman Point, Ms Raffaele recently told ABC Radio Perth. ""There were a couple of areas where people were living, [homes] ranged from tin huts, wooden huts to tents, to something considerably rougher,"" she says. ""And there was a community that basically was there for decades, on Crown land."" It became known as the Smelter's Camp because of its proximity to the Fremantle Smelting Works on South Beach, which processed gold and other ores and had a distinctive smokestack. The homes first began to be constructed in late 1800s, although it was used by Aboriginal people as a camping area long before that. The camp housed a mix of people who found setting up house on sandy land not far from popular South Beach their only option. ""There were a lot of people who were living there who were workers at the industrial area, the abattoirs, Robb Jetty, later the smelter itself,"" Ms Raffaele says. ""There were people who had come down from the Goldfields early on, and migrants and people who possibly weren't able to live anywhere else. ""Sometimes there were people who weren't able to mix in society quite as much. They were recovering from mental illness, there were migrants who weren't yet integrated. ""There were women who lived there a long time with their children, and obviously, a great population of transient men."" Ms Raffaele's research involved searching for the names and stories of the people who lived there. With support from the City of Cockburn she found 200 names, and after a fellowship at the Battye Library, which holds much of the state's historical records, she found a further 60 names and details of residents of the camp. ""I spent a lot of time looking through electoral rolls initially because some people listed the camp as their place of residence in the electoral roll,"" she says. ""Then I was looking at newspapers where perhaps something had happened, someone had been robbed, or someone had been arrested, that they listed. ""Then you can start to see the network of people and how they survived and what their life was like and how they worked. ""If you were really lucky, you also got a glimpse of character. ""I start with a name and I end with a life."" One extraordinary life story she found was that of Pietro Lujo, also known as Petar and Peter the Slav, who emigrated from Croatia and worked on the Boulder mines as a fireman in the early 1900s. ""In 1911, he came down with an illness and he was diagnosed with [lung disease] miner's phthisis and given two months to live,"" Ms Raffaele says. ""I don't know about this medical advice, but his doctors said that he could extend his life if he drank blood."" Lujo moved to Fremantle and determined to follow the doctor's suggestion, befriended the manager of one of abattoirs near the Smelter's Camp, and set up camp nearby. ""He had his two dogs, Billy and Susie, and he's quoted [in the Daily News in 1939] as saying there was 'a plentiful supply of the magic fluid',"" Ms Raffaele says. Lujo ""drank three or four pints a day for 16 years"", before dying in the Claremont Men's Home in 1943. While the newspaper reports focused on the crime, poverty and squalor at the camp, Ms Raffaele says she also found happy memories of the community, including people still alive who remembered a camp childhood. ""I met a man named Terry Fulton, whose parents lived in the vicinity, and he remembers a really carefree childhood where he could roam around the area,"" she says. ""He described in great detail what his little house looked like … and it wasn't something that he perceived as lacking by any means. ""He had a really beautiful childhood until he was about 10 and had to go off to school, which he wasn't so pleased about."" But by the 1950s, concerns about the camps were growing. In 1953, The Sunday Times visited and wrote a story titled, 'They call it poverty point and no wonder!' It went on to describe conditions at the camp and some of the people who lived there: ""To someone this is home. It is shabby outside. Inside they have even put pictures on the wall. An old chair outside has on oil drum supporting the seat where a leg is missing. It will come as a shock to many — even in days of housing shortages — to find that people still live in conditions like this."" Mrs. M. Westicott, another old-age pensioner who has been in her present ""home"" for the past 7 years, said: ""We've got to be satisfied with the conditions. We haven't the money to go elsewhere."" Opposition grew further as reports emerged of some homes being actually being rented or sold to residents, despite sitting on Crown land. The Sunday Times published an editorial in January 1955 headlined: 'Notorious Beach Camp Must Go', calling for the camp's demolition: ""Its dwellings, many built of scraps from nearby rubbish dumps, mostly have crude sanitation and are without water, gas, or light. Some have been occupied for years. Several have been bought and sold. Although some decent, respectable people — some pensioners — live at the camp, generally it is a dangerous, shameful refuge. Every help should be given the poverty-stricken aged to find a new home. But the Smelter's Camp must go. In June 1957, the bulldozers moved in, but Ms Raffaele says the demolition was not clear cut, and some people reported simply moving to the other side of the railway line, rather than out of the area. These days the site has been extensively redeveloped and nothing remains of the former camp, but the stories are being preserved by Ms Raffaele's research. ""I just wanted these people to be remembered,"" she says. ""I have so many rich stories of people who lived just incredible lives, people who fought in the Boxer Rebellion, people who were showmen, women who travelled halfway across the world and then ended up in dire straits. ""I just thought that they were entitled to be remembered as part of the time as [much as] any other person who had achieved success.""

230,Indian film RRR wins big at Aussie box office,arts-culture,"  Indian film RRR strikes box office gold after debuting behind The Batman Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An epic Indian action film has achieved a rare feat, debuting in second place at the Australian box office. RRR tells a fictionalised account of two real-life Indian revolutionaries who fought against the British Raj. According to data from Screen Australia, RRR made $2.43 million for the week ending March 30, putting it behind only DC superhero film The Batman, which made $3.52 million. The film has been released at 133 locations across Australia in multiple languages, including Telugu, Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam and Kannada, and has made a total of $3.02 million after its second week showing in Australia. It is a big debut at the Aussie box office for an Indian film and a non-English language film, but RRR director S.S. Rajamouli said he was not surprised. ""Australia has always appreciated good films and content,"" Rajamouli said. ""They've accepted Indian films as their own. ""The box office numbers in Australia reflect their love for Indian cinema."" The period film clocks in at just over three hours and features big-name Indian stars N.T. Rama Rao Jr and Ram Charan, as well as Northern Irish actor Ray Stevenson, who is known for his role as Volstagg in the Thor movies. ""RRR's core emotion is the bonding between two accidental friends,"" Rajamouli said. ""Friendship knows no languages or borders. ""I always believed that this subject would appeal to a wider audience and it's good to know that we succeeded in that."" RRR's haul of $3 million to date is a strong start for a foreign language film in Australia, with the top five at the box office typically dominated by English-language films. By comparison, 2001's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon had a lifetime gross of $11.2 million in Australia. Other top foreign film box office performers include 2019 Korean drama Parasite and 2001's French comedy Amelie, which made lifetime grosses of $5.9 million and $7.2 million respectively nationally, according to data from Screen Australia. Making RRR was a massive undertaking, shooting over 300 days across locations including Hyderabad, Bulgaria and Ukraine, with more than 1,200 people working on the project on a daily basis. RRR has the second-biggest budget ever for an Indian film, costing more than US$72.4 million ($97.05 million) to make, and it's the most expensive film ever made in Telugu language. ""As a filmmaker, I wish for my films to reach and connect with audiences across the world,"" Rajamouli said. ""If the film succeeds, it will reach more people and will therefore reflect in box office collections as well."" RRR has already made more than US$125 million ($168 million) worldwide since its premiere in January, buoyed by a wide US release and a significant IMAX release.

231,Buzz about new Royal Australian Mint $2 coin,arts-culture,"  Royal Australian Mint releases $2 honey bee coin to mark bicentenary of the industry in Australia Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Royal Australian Mint has released a new coin, and there's a special buzz about it. Marking 200 years since the insect's introduction to Australia, the $2 collector's coin features two honey bees, commemorating ""both the remarkable creatures and conscientious beekeepers"". ""We've got a role at the Mint to help tell the stories of Australia through coins. So we're always on the lookout for significant events, anniversaries and organisations that we can commemorate through coins,"" Royal Australian Mint chief executive Leigh Gordon said. ""The coin that we have, I think it's a particularly beautiful coin. It's got a couple of the honey bees, it's got Australian flowers and trees around the edges, and it's got a really rich sort of honey like coloured honeycomb in the centre. ""It really is a very attractive sight."" Mr Gordon said the honey bee coin had been in the works ""for about 14 months"". ""We've got a product development team here at the Mint that's putting their thinking caps on all the time. But we also get suggestions from the public,"" he said. In this coin's case, the Mint worked with the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council on both the concept and the execution. ""We [wanted to] capture the essence of what they thought was important in the coin,"" Mr Gordon said. ""And then we go through the process of actually designing something that looks beautiful, that we can manufacture here, that would attract people's attention and is of interest."" The honey bee coin is what is known as an ""uncirculated coin"" — so it's not one you will find in your spare change drawer. Rather, it is created as a collector's item that you have to purchase from the Mint — and Mr Gordon said one in four Australians considered themselves coin collectors. ""A lot of them describe what they see in their change, but certainly a number of people go out of their way to collect a particular theme or a particular type of coin,"" he said. ""Hopefully it'll strike a chord, particularly with those that have an interest in the honey industry — and it's a significant industry in Australia."" The Mint described the honey bee as small, yet mighty, ""producing delicious honey and contributing to the country’s agricultural success by pollinating crops"". And Australia's honey industry is indeed significant. ""There are about 20,000 beekeepers, somewhere in the order of 640,000 hives, and they make about 30,000 tonnes of honey each year,"" Mr Gordon said. ""So it's quite a quite a big industry, and that honey goes all over the world. So it's good to commemorate something like this."" Trevor Weatherhead, chair of the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council, said the humble honey bee is responsible for pollinating about two-thirds of Australia's crops. ""We all know we have the good 100 per cent Australian honey that's out there, people can enjoy that,"" he said. ""But our biggest value is in the horticulture and agricultural industries, where it's been estimated that about $14.2 billion worth of crops that are grown in Australia rely on honey bees for pollination. ""They're some of the crops like almonds or watermelons, rockmelons, honeydews those sort of things. No bees, they don't get a crop."" Mr Weatherhead said the commercial bee hive population was ""fairly steady"", and the number of registered hives in Australia was increasing thanks to recreational beekeepers, who have hives in their backyard. ""During the pandemic, there seems to have been a reasonable increase in the number of people keeping hives as a hobby. They sort of suddenly discovered that there's something that they can do [for bees] at home and there's been a big increase that way,"" he said. ""They probably don't realise it but they're pollinating a lot of the backyard veggie gardens, whether it's something like zucchinis or if they're growing cucumbers or watermelons, as well as getting a bit of honey."" The Australian Mint regularly releases coins to commemorate or honour different events and people. In 2020, they released a ""donation dollar"" — a legal tender designed to be given to people in need. Then, in 2021, a coin honouring Indigenous military service featuring artwork from Kalkadoon artist Chern'ee Sutton was released. ""Some recent really successful coins that we've had have been around the history of steam engines in Australia,"" Mr Gordon added. ""We had a great coin last year that recognised the 50th anniversary of the Tamworth country music festival, and we obviously have honoured our first responders and our frontline workers through recent coins."" Mr Gordon said a key component of each coin produced was the storytelling aspect. ""It is currency as a way of helping tell the stories of Australia,"" he said. ""Capturing that, we take that role really seriously here at the Mint. ""It makes the people that we have working here — the passionate designers, the marketing people in manufacturing — it really gives them I guess a bit of a buzz in return, to do something that's appreciated by the Australian public."" Mr Weatherhead said the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council hoped the coin would raise awareness of the importance of bees. ""We've been amazed at the response,"" he said. ""Those avid coin collectors, well, they've got something else to add to their collection now that's got a very good story behind it. ""And hopefully they'll realise that and every time they look at it, they'll think of the honey bee and think of how it helps feed us all.""

232,Not even Sydney's torrential rain can stop The Phantom of the Opera,arts-culture,"  The Phantom of the Opera is an enduring musical, even in Sydney's torrential rain Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Phantom of the Opera has been around for so long, you'd think it would be hard to change it up in such a way that people who've seen it before will have a new experience. But in a world-first, the production is being held outdoors at Mrs Macquaries Point with the idyllic backdrop that is Sydney Harbour. Sounds great – until you factor in the type of weather Sydney is currently experiencing. Maree Johnson is taking a break from playing Madame Giry in the Broadway production of The Phantom of the Opera, to play that same role in the Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour production of the show. Johnson has a long history with the musical – she was in the original production in Melbourne in 1990 as the alternate Christine – the female protagonist. She then took over the role of Christine in Sydney, before moving to the United States and assuming the role of Madame Giry in 2017. ""So, time flies by,"" Johnson said. ""You get a little older, get a little wiser, and then you age into Madame Giry, 25-something years later."" Johnson's Broadway-run was interrupted by the pandemic in 2020. ""It was the most iconic shutdown,"" she said ""We shut down in May 2020. ""I got COVID in May 2020 a few days after the shutdown."" Johnson said the cast and crew thought they may be shut down for two to three weeks. Eighteen months later, New York City opened again and the show continued in October 2021. She said it was the first time The Phantom of the Opera had shut down like that in its history. ""Phantom has been running for so long on Broadway. ""They're about to celebrate their 35th year on January 26, 2023. ""The show had never shut down."" Back in her hometown of Sydney, the show has continued despite the torrential rain. ""We don't have a roof, so we are totally exposed,"" Johnson said. ""So, there's an elevated sense of energy to this. ""There's an elevated commitment to it too, because it's so much bigger, and you're outside with nature, the wind, you're out there with the rain. ""Amazingly, we've only had one show where we had to stop. ""And that was towards the end of Act Two."" Johnson said there are a lot of effects in the theatrical staging of the show. ""You've got fire, you've got pyro, you've got trucks coming in revolving, you've got cranes flying in pieces of the set. ""So, every show we kind of hold our breath."" It isn't just the cast who have to contend with the weather; the audience sits in an area that is uncovered. Simon Phillips is the director who was especially chosen by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber to create this new version of the renowned musical. It's his job to re-imagine all the classic moments of The Phantom of the Opera in the spirit of Sydney Harbour. ""The audience has to be really bloody into it and very tolerant and patient to sit there getting substantially soaked,"" he said. He said working outdoors has certainly brought its challenges. ""A world of pain, really,"" he said. ""I don't need to tell you what the weather's been like in Sydney for the last two months. ""It's just been horrendous. ""We had about 28 tonnes of mud that had to be removed from the site. ""We lost a lot of tech during the weather. ""We had nights where the whole orchestra pit, which is underneath the harbour stage, just flooded with water, while electrical storms raged upstairs and no one was allowed to perform for safety reasons."" He said lightening is the only reason the production has to stop. But the performance and rehearsals can continue in torrential rain. When the weather isn't a problem – like on opening night – the experience, he said, is extraordinary for everyone involved and there's a real buzz in the crowd. ""Just seeing something on that scale is so thrilling. ""There's such a thrill in the air about being outside on the harbour, the famous view in the background and a work as known and unashamedly popular as The Phantom of the Opera is, with the storytelling and the murder and the mayhem. ""It just felt like a great show to be doing in that setting."" Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour's The Phantom of the Opera will run until April 24.

234,Wild weather uncovers Australia's best preserved shipwreck 'Buster',arts-culture,"  Wild weather on the NSW Mid North Coast uncovers 'Buster', Australia's best-preserved shipwreck Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It's hard to find any positives to the recent flooding and heavy seas in northern NSW, but in the mid north coast town of Woolgoolga, the wild weather has resulted in a welcome visitor. 'Buster' the shipwreck is usually mostly covered by sand, only remerging from time to time when tide and surf conditions are right. The recent weather event on the NSW Mid North Coast has exposed the aged remains of the vessel- considered one of the best-preserved shipwrecks in the country. ""It's one of the few historic shipwrecks out of over 700 on Australian waters in coastal zones that actually sits on the beach,"" Tim Smith, director of Heritage Assessment NSW said. ""It's just an amazing time capsule"" Mr Smith said. Buster's full exposure used to be a more rare event, but Mr Smith said that since 2009, the vessel had been uncovered almost annually, which may lead to an acceleration to its deterioration. The once impressive 310-tonne, 39-metre tall timber barquentine was built in Nova Scotia, Canada where it made port at Woolgoolga Jetty in 1893 to load timber bound for New Zealand. Heritage records recount a wall of water that smashed the side of the boat breaking the anchor chain and sweeping it out to sea on February 17, 1893. The Buster was later driven ashore and became a total wreck at the mouth of Woolgoolga Lake on March 8. The wreck is protected by heritage legislation; it's an offence to move, damage, disturb or destroy the wreck or anything associated with it, including 'relics' from the ship. The latest unearthing of Buster has sparked conservation concerns; Mr Smith said the increasingly frequent appearance of the wreck had meant more exposure to the elements. ""From the last time it was exposed last year the vessel was out of the sand in the water for quite a long time and got a bit of algae growth"" ""It's all part of the shipwreck experience, they do generally break down over time"" A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment said the sites of shipwrecks are constantly changing, meaning the environmental effects that may cause them to deteriorate over time is inevitable. ""Local communities can assist the conservation of these shipwrecks by reporting changes to their state of territory heritage agency to maintain the preservation of these historic sites"" said the spokesperson.

235,A sneak peek inside some of Launceston's iconic buildings,arts-culture,"  Open House Launceston sees the city's most iconic buildings open to the public Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Franki Birrell bought Claremont Estate in Launceston's east five years ago and has been in love with it ever since. The heritage home was built in 1843 and was part of a large allotment of land. It now has two kitchens, six bedrooms and three bathrooms, with renovations ongoing. ""Since it was built, it's been sold a couple of times, there's no real record of sales before about 1859,"" she said. ""It was owned by the Gunns family most recently before me."" Much of the original structure remains the same, something Ms Birrell said she was very passionate about. ""Some of the old features of the house are still here and we are making sure they're kept and that we are as sensitive as possible,"" she said. ""The history of the house needs to be preserved for years to come. ""It's one of the only examples of pisé building construction in Launceston, which is an interesting method, but basically means clay from the property here was forced between boards and they were removed as it hardens. ""I'm told it's one of only two like it in Launceston."" Despite the age of the house, Ms Birrell said during her time there had been no ghosts. ""It is an old house, but no, I haven't seen any ghosts and if there are any they're very friendly,"" she said. The property is one of four iconic architectural properties in northern Tasmania that will be open to the public for this year's Open House Launceston event. ""Claremont has traditionally been a very private house but I think it's time people enjoyed it ... it's a very important piece of history,"" she said. Are you sick of the mainland and fancy a change to the country life? Well, two of Australia's oldest mansions, both with a convict past, are up for sale — but the prices being asked are anything but a steal. Emma Anglesey, Open House co-producer and director of Festival of Architecture and Sound, said music and art exhibits would be on show inside the properties. ""We are passionate about beautiful spaces with incredible acoustics and we’re inspired by architecture — how it can make our spirit and voices soar,"" she said. ""The artists have been carefully chosen to match the spaces, and the shows are designed to both elevate the architecture, the art forms and the audience experience."" Jennifer Nichols, executive director for the Australian Institute of Architects' Tasmanian chapter, said Launceston had a treasure trove of architecture right at its doorstep. ""We love Launceston and are thrilled that the public enjoy the program as much as we do,"" she said. In the 1900s, Launceston had a thriving theatre scene, with thousands of people attending the picture theatre and live performances each weekend. Built in 1915, the National Theatre on the corner of Charles and Paterson streets is also open for theatre buffs to explore. Much of the original building remains in place today. Now the site is used by a printing company that uses the stage and seating areas for storage. Residential property Paddy Dorney House in West Launceston is also being opened after much renovation. The house overlooks the CBD and has an iconic fireplace with a window built around it. ""The project took a small, standard, 1960 brick-veneer Australian villa and its garden, and explored affordable redesign, seeking a spatial and cultural relevance for a new millennium,"" Open House Hobart said. ""It has been a long labour of love which may be evident to the visitor."" The Jackson Motor Company car yard will be the fourth site open for the public when the event runs in May.

236,Steel trunk that took iconic Australian illusionist to the world returns home,arts-culture,"  The Great Levante's £1,000 Steel Trunk Mystery brought to Australia by Arts Centre Melbourne Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The most iconic prop of Australia's biggest magic export is back on home soil after Arts Centre Melbourne's acquisition of the Great Levante's £1,000 Steel Trunk Mystery. Born Leslie George Vante Cole in Sydney in 1892, the Great Levante was a stage illusionist who performed around the world from the late 1920s until he retired in 1977. The £1,000 Steel Trunk Mystery act involved Levante magically changing places with an assistant who'd been tied in a sack and locked inside the trunk — the switch seemed to happen in seconds. Early in his career Levante had performed escape tricks out of boxes and packing crates, however magic historian Kent Blackmore said the steel trunk took the substitution trick to a new level. ""What made Les's routine different was that the solid metal trunk that he had built by Will Melmore could be examined to the nth degree; you could spend the month looking at this trunk and never ever work out any way of getting in or out of the box,"" he said. ""It was just a piece of amazing theatre – it was all over in supposedly just a few seconds and yet the magic was just impossible to comprehend."" After Levante died in 1978, the steel trunk was passed on to British illusionist Jeffery Atkins. It remained overseas until 2021 when it was sold by Potter & Potter Auctions in Chicago alongside some documents including a sketch showing how the trunk can be operated. The Australian Performing Arts Collection at Arts Centre Melbourne was the winning bidder, buying the trunk for $US6,600 ($8,826) with funds from the Maxwell & Merle Carroll Bequest. The world of stage magic in Australia was a male affair, until Esme Levante, Myrtle Roberts and Moi-Yo Miller came along. Curator Margaret Marshall says it is a ""very exciting"" acquisition that adds to the Levante costumes, props, programs and photographs donated to the collection by Levante's widow, Gladys Cole. ""It is a really key, one-off rare item,"" Ms Marshall said. ""To have it come to rest in Australia, it's really a lovely thing, because it connects with [The Great Levante] so much and is part of our history."" The trunk is being stored at Public Record Office Victoria in North Melbourne, however Ms Marshall is looking at opportunities to put it on display. ""It's such a great thing,"" she said. ""We want to share it, there's no point in having it squirrelled away."" Mr Blackmore says The Great Levante came from humble beginnings, working his way around Australia as a solo performer with very small props. ""He gained lots of experience by doing everything himself in Australia, then he decided to take his chances and go overseas,"" Mr Blackmore said. ""He spent three or four years travelling all the way up through China and India, as far up as the Siberian border, before he ended up in Britain in the early 1930s."" It was in the UK that Levante launched his first big illusion and variety show called How's Tricks. ""It was hugely successful,"" Mr Blackmore said. ""The main thing with Levante was his personality. ""He wasn't an inventor of magic himself, he was just a great presenter – very friendly, in control, and never afraid if something went wrong.""

237,Tilda Swinton is an orchidologist haunted by an unexplained noise in Cannes prize winner Memoria,arts-culture,"  In Memoria, Tilda Swinton and Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul navigate a haunted Colombia Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog One of several especially hypnotising scenes from Apichatpong Weerasethakul's Cannes Jury Prize-winning latest film – his first to feature international star power, in the shape of Tilda Swinton – lands early in the piece, at a recording studio in the Colombian capital of Bogotá. Jessica, played by an understated Swinton – operating on a plane light-years away from her over-the-top performances in films such as The French Dispatch – has a peculiar favour to ask young audio engineer Hernán (Juan Pablo Urrego). She has been haunted by a particular sound – something that went whomp! in the night – since it startled her awake recently, and finds herself more and more compelled to identify the source. At first, she had assumed the sound to be a product of early morning construction work nearby – but becomes unsettled when she's told by her brother-in-law Juan (Daniel Giménez Cacho, 2017's Zama), at whose house she's staying on her visit to Bogotá from Medellín, that there isn't any. ""It's like… a huge ball of concrete… that falls into a metal well… surrounded by sea water,"" Jessica tells Hernán, struggling to summon the requisite specificity, especially in her halting Spanish. The engineer gamely cycles through a catalogue of movie sound effects, manipulating them according to Jessica's feedback: ""More earthy""; ""more bass"". There's a gentle absurdity to the scene, acknowledged by the apologetic little laughs Jessica emits as she attempts to refine her description of this thing that may exist only in her mind, but it's weirdly gripping, too: the sound that haunts Jessica also haunts the viewer, who is in effect inducted as a fellow amateur detective; her companion on a mission that drifts inexorably into the metaphysical, tinged by science fiction. Despite Memoria being the Thai master's first cinematic venture outside of his home country, its uncanny dimensions will feel familiar to those who have journeyed with him before: in Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, his Palme d'Or-winning film from 2010, the titular character readily receives visitors who have already passed on as he prepares for his own passing; in Cemetery of Splendour, from 2015, comatose soldiers communicate from their hospital beds via psychic means. In Apichatpong's thrillingly distinctive cinema, the boundaries between past and present, and between the material and the spiritual worlds, prove porous. Much as two colours layered create a third, these crossovers illuminate histories lost or repressed. Never has this been more explicit than in Memoria – the title literally translating to 'memory', a term that has political resonance in Colombia, as a nation still processing the extent and impact of the intensely violent period that spanned the second half of the 20th century up until the peace process of 2016. This historical trauma is not Jessica's: like Swinton, she is Scottish, and although she's been living in Colombia (ostensibly because of her work as an orchid farmer), she is fundamentally still a tourist. Nor does it belong to Apichatpong. That both actor and filmmaker necessarily approached the landscape as foreigners, gingerly attempting to tune into its reverberations, was integral to the film's design. Having discussed working together for more than a decade, they chose to meet on mutually uncommon ground: only in an alien environment could Swinton function as an analogue for Apichatpong. The recurrent 'whomp!' in Jessica's head and the attendant insomnia are rooted in his experience with the sleep disorder known as exploding head syndrome. Sleep-deprived and furthermore encumbered by grief (there are subtle indications that she has recently lost her husband), Jessica – whom Swinton approached not as a character but a ""predicament"" – drifts through Bogotá and into the surrounding countryside in search of nothing more substantial than a sound. Like her namesake, the mysterious Jessica Holland from Jacques Tourneur's 1943 voodoo horror I Walked with a Zombie, she is something of a sleepwalker. The pacing is correspondingly somnambulant. Indeed, Apichatpong has always tended towards letting the action – if it can be called that – play out at a cool distance, with cuts and camera movement kept to a minimum. That's not to say that his films are austere; the tenderness they exude, and the almost impish humour, make the use of such a label misleading. Rather, they are trance-inducing, capable of being utterly arresting in their quietude – which makes the bang with which Memoria opens (and closes, in a pretty wild reveal) doubly startling. When Jessica returns to the recording studio to speak with Hernán again, she's told that no one by that name works there. But she does meet another Hernán later in the piece (played by Elkin Díaz), their encounter seeming more than a coincidence. ""This brings me close to what you call a dream,"" this older Hernán says to Jessica as he proffers a shot glass of homemade liqueur. It's a description that is eminently applicable to Memoria itself. Unlike most dreams, however, Memoria is likely to stay with you long after your blinking eyes have readjusted to the sunlight.

238,Ambitious slouch hat-shaped museum will be full to brim with Australian war stories,arts-culture,"  Slouch Hat Museum in Gladstone proposed to share Australian military stories via holograms Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An ambitious proposal for a unique war museum in central Queensland will include a building shaped like a classic piece of military headwear known as a slouch hat. The Slouch Hat Museum will be located in Gladstone's Anzac Park, adjacent to the Gladstone Bowls Club. Bowls club chairman Graham McVean said the project had been in the pipeline for about 10 years. ""I think just about every city in Australia has a military museum that's got a tank out the front, or a cannon, we don't see this as being that sort of museum,"" Mr McVean said. ""We think the building itself, shaped in the image of a slouch hat with a brim that will be able to be elevated, will be an attraction for people to want to come to Gladstone. ""Once you're inside we're planning a totally interactive museum."" Mr McVean said while there would be artefacts and other items generally found in war museums, the stand-out attraction would be a 60-seat hologram theatre. ""It will be an education-type facility, and it will allow holograms to appear on stage with veterans from all conflicts, including Indigenous veterans, to tell their stories in their own words,"" he said. Mr McVean said they would do this by using already documented material, but they were also in the process of working with veterans to record their stories. ""We've been able to find a fellow who served at Maralinga where they tested atom bombs, and we've been chronicling his story for the last two years,"" he said. ""We've identified about five local people, and one of them is Indigenous, and we will be able to tell those stories from the hologram theatre."" But the project will not come cheap, with a $26 million price tag attached to it. ""We're looking at [applying for funding] from the federal government, and also the state government,"" Mr McVean said. ""We'll also go to the private sector and the corporate sector."" He said the emerging hydrogen industry in Gladstone could potentially play a role in the museum's funding, in the same way legacy Gladstone industries such as aluminium and gas invested in community infrastructure. ""I think it's probably incumbent on industry to support the town and the city that they make their money out of, like these companies are making billions,"" he said. Mr McVean this week presented a completed business case for the project to the Gladstone Regional Council. The council had invested $75,000 into the case, with the bowls club and Mr McVean contributing the second $75,000. Councillor Chris Cameron said the council was supportive of the proposal and would advocate for funding from higher levels of government and private industry. ""I'd like to see some finances in place this year, with a view to moving towards some form of construction in 2023,"" he said. ""To have a facility like this up and running when the Olympics are on, it would be a great statement for Gladstone.""

239,Music producers and engineers 'blown away' during Ngaanyatjarra Lands recordings,arts-culture,"  Sounds of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands and Esperance captured in new double-album released through WAM project Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog In one of West Australian Music's (WAM) most remote projects to date, artists from the Goldfields-Esperance region have been recorded in a double album that captures, among other sounds, a uniquely desert style of reggae. Entitled, Demos from the Ngaanyatjarra Lands and Esperance, it is the 15th compilation from WAM's regional recording project. Musicians from Esperance and Warburton were given the opportunity to record for free with some of WA's top producers and sound engineers, creating an album that WAM regional officer Nigel Bird said was truly reflective of each region. ""Ngaanyatjarra Lands is part of the central desert areas of Australia, and that part of the world, over probably the last 20, 30 years, has been part of a phenomenon where a style of music has overtaken,"" he said. ""It is almost the only genre of music that people listen to and love — the desert reggae genre. ""Most of the songs are sung in Ngaanyatjarra, maybe a bit of Pitjantjatjara and they're often of country, of places, of fruits, some of the tracks are about all different bush food."" Mr Bird said the Esperance album, which featured nine artists, highlighted the mix of genres present in the small community's growing music scene. ""On that album we've got hip hop, we've got rock, we've got indie rock, we've got great folky indie pop stuff, there's a little bit of hard rock, there's blues,"" he said. Esperance rapper Morgan Kelly, who goes by the stage name Dr Tasty, recorded her track, Hopscotch, for the album. Ms Kelly hoped the new track would help kickstart her music career after everything came to a halt at the start of the pandemic. ""I signed with a record label in Perth for a year contract at the end of 2019,"" she said. ""I did have tours lined up, but obviously COVID-19 happened so that all came to a stop. ""I'm still in contact with them and I'm hoping to get it started up again."" The Arid Ones lead vocalist and bassist Cooper Jarzabek said it was the first time the band, which contributed the song Death Row to the album, had recorded since it formed two years ago. The 18-year-old said the Esperance music scene — driven largely by musician Kyron Smithson and his event management business, Kyza Presents — helped the band prepare to record. ""Before I was born there wasn't much of a music scene, but this man's Kyza came along and revamped it all,""  Mr Jarzabek said. ""We had the idea of making the band, but we weren't very good songwriters and he gave us a boost. ""He plays for this other band, Grand Casual, and they've been basically like our grandfathers, our daddies, showing us what to do and showing us the ropes and getting us gigs and all that."" Mr Bird said they spent nine days recording in each unique location, but the musicianship and recording knowledge from artists in the remote Aboriginal community of Warburton blew the sound engineers away. ""A number of the artists there were so quick, just so quick,"" he said. ""One or two tracks went down in three hours, which is kind of unheard of really, certainly for the programs that we run. Demos from Ngaanyatjarra Lands were recorded at Wilurarra Creative in Warburton, a communal multi-use space for the arts.

240,Rain brings tiny land crustaceans known as forest hoppers to Brisbane suburbs ,arts-culture,"  Rain brings tiny land crustaceans known as forest hoppers to Brisbane suburbs Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Lawn prawns, forest hoppers, water fleas — there are a few names for the tiny creatures you may find in your home after recent heavy rain. Wavell Heights resident Helen Bender first noticed the tiny creatures dead in her home in December and has been on a mission to find out what exactly they were. ""The best way of describing them is [like] microscopic prawns or shrimps,"" Ms Bender said. ""I've only ever found them dead inside my house. I've never seen a live one. ""When I first saw one, I thought it was a flea, but on closer inspection, it wasn't a flea."" The largest forest hopper Ms Bender found was about 5 millimetres, but others ranged in size from 1 to 2mm. ""I have spent quite a few weeks trying to hunt down what they were and, if they were a problem, what I could do about them,"" she said. That is when Queensland Museum collection manager for molluscs and crustaceans Darryl Potter offered his expertise. He said the small creatures were indeed a type of crustacean known as amphipods, but unlike crabs, crayfish, lobsters and prawns with five pairs of legs, the lawn prawns had seven pairs. Amphipods have also adapted to life on land and can grow to 7mm in length. They come out at night after periods of rain and often enter lowset homes, pets' bowls, swimming pools and other human environments. However, come morning, they dry out and die. Amphipods feed on microorganisms in the soil and contribute to the decomposition of the forest floor. They are harmless to humans and pets and are widespread across parts of Queensland and NSW, where there is plenty of rainfall and warm conditions. Mr Potter said the animals were also known as leafhoppers because they usually emerged from mulch and leaf litter or as carpet prawns because the first time many people noticed them was when they entered their homes. ""We've had an incredible amount of rain recently, so these things have started coming out because it's activated them,"" he said. ""There's not too much you can do about them. ""The particular species people find, called Talitroides topitotum, was actually introduced ages ago from Sri Lanka, and now it's found pretty broadly across the temperate and tropical parts of the world. ""We do have a whole range of native ones, but much like the problems you get with cane toads and Asian house geckos, the invaders are more successful, so they tend to be found by people after wet weather."" Ms Bender suspected the influx of tiny creatures was related to the rain and noticed them ""come in waves"" into her home. ""The funny thing is I don't even have lawn or garden beds,"" she said.

241,This town has made the most of its silo art and it could provide a model for other communities,arts-culture,"  Karoonda's winning formula for silo art brings benefits for business and tourism, years after the paint dried Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A South Australian town is reaping the benefits of its silo art years after the paint dried, and it could provide a model for other communities. In 2019 the Mallee town of Karoonda used drought funding to transform its silos, giving Melbourne artist Heesco a giant canvas on which to paint a kelpie and sheep from a local farm. In an Australian-first the town chose to leave the centre silo blank for evening projections. Every month different SA artists share their work on the massive concrete structure and the town has worked together to boost its tourism potential, with local shops staying open and upgraded accommodation options. Karoonda District Traders chair Keith Wood said the town's silo art had ""put Karoonda on the map"". ""It's done a lot of good for the businesses around town as well,"" Mr Wood said. Karoonda's approach seems to have nailed the essence of what research has identified makes the growing public art trend work better for some towns than others. And its success may be a model to help other regional communities that have plans to paint their own silos. Last year researchers from Griffith University surveyed 1,100 businesses, residents and visitors and found 47 per cent had noticed a collective economic benefit from the silo art. Lead researcher Amelia Green said open shops and continued marketing were key to attracting visitors and increasing spending. ""Rather than thinking of it as an isolated project that's finished when the paint dries, it's seeing it as part of a broader revitalisation strategy,"" Dr Green said. ""And also acknowledging that like any other investment it's going to need some ongoing promotion and marketing."" The economic benefits from the silo artwork have been felt by Karoonda traders. ""We've noticed it ourselves. We've got a cafe in the main street and we've got a lot of people coming through,"" Mr Wood said. ""The shops are open, we have a craft shop opposite the silos that's fairly popular, other takeaway places and farmhouse and quilt shop ... a lot of people have benefited."" The District Council of Karoonda East Murray last month opened four new powered sites at the Karoonda Tourist Park and has plans for further upgrades, including two new self-sustainable cabins and a camp kitchen. ""Some people come up the night before and stay at the caravan park ... it's a nice weekend, you can have a couple days here,"" Mr Wood said. Karoonda's success could provide strategies for other towns that have plans to transform silos into a public art display. Lameroo, in the southern Mallee, has appointed South Australian artist Jack Fran to paint its silos, and community consultation in October was designed to ensure the artwork reflected the local community. This connection to a town's rural heritage and character was identified by researchers as being key, and Dr Green said it was why silo art had become so popular in Australia. ""There are a few painted silos in America and Asia but it hasn't caught on there,"" she said. ""I think it comes back to the role of the silo in the Australian psyche as well. ""It is a place traditionally where communities gather and it symbolises collective achievement of the farming community. ""Most of the silo [art] celebrates everyday heroes, so that kind of slant obviously also resonates with Australian psyche.""

242,Complexity dominates Black Summer bushfire recovery in People's Republic of Mallacoota,arts-culture,"  People's Republic of Mallacoota turns the lens on the complexity of Black Summer recovery Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The far-eastern Victorian township of Mallacoota is under the national spotlight again following last night's premiere of the new ABC TV documentary series People's Republic of Mallacoota. The series journals the aftermath of the catastrophic December 2019 Black Summer bushfires through the personal stories of residents who lost their homes to the fires and the formation of the town's community lead recovery committee, the Mallacoota and District Recovery Association (MADRA). The 12-person, volunteer MADRA committee was formed on the back of community elections in an effort to prioritise key areas of the town's recovery. Can the traumatised survivors of a bushfire-ravaged coastal community seize control of their own destiny, overcome their differences, and save their town from dying? It was faced with issues ranging from housing, building and infrastructure, a sustainable energy supply, community wellbeing, business support, a fuel management strategy, and the regeneration of Mallacoota's environment and biodiversity. ""We knew that there was a story about a new way of recovering from highly traumatic disasters which seem to be playing out more and more often in Australia,"" director Tony Jackson said. ""We knew there was something for Australia to learn from what was going on in Mallacoota."" Having previously worked on the documentary Aftermath: Beyond Black Saturday with Renegade Films, Mr Jackson spent two years filming and following locals while editing hundreds of hours of footage with his team. ""What I wanted to avoid was the language and the tropes of bushfires that we were all becoming immune to"", Mr Jackson said. ""We've almost painted everybody with this vanilla wash of 'we're resilient, we can get through this'. ""Sometimes we can't, sometimes the only way we can get through this is laughing about it or being angry about it."" Although there are differing and divided opinions within the Mallacoota community of how MADRA and other agencies were represented in the series, the majority of participants believe the filmmakers treated the story with dignity, sensitivity, and respect. ""I think they've done a fantastic job of weaving 18 months worth of filming — a lot of filming, a lot of hours, a lot footage — into 6 half hour episodes that are quite watchable,"" Jude Benton, a church minister for Mallacoota and Cann River, said. ""They promised us all along that they would respect our journeys and they wouldn't let this be a divisive film for the town. ""I think they've done a good job of showing that there's differences of opinion without polarising people."" Responsible for ingesting much of the town's donations at the local St Peters church, Reverend Benton's dry wit and candid commentary provides much of the series' light relief on some of the most ridiculous aspects of disaster recovery. In the first episode she finds herself sorting through a mysterious donation of a palette of thousands of chocolate bullets. Likewise, artist and community activist Don Ashby, who lost his home, highlights humour in the absurdity of post-bushfire life, trying to manage living in a makeshift caravan arrangement with two adult sons and numerous pets. ""At the moment audiences are traumatised by COVID and climate change and war, and I wanted them to stay with me because these people are just like you and I,"" Mr Jackson said. ""They're funny and complex. They gave me a lot to work with."" Mallacoota is also well contextualised with some entertaining archival footage of the town's abalone industry, a burgeoning bohemian community of the 1960s, and a famous Skippy episode. It also acknowledges historic divisions in the town on everything from tourism and development to environment and sustainability. With natural disasters becoming more frequent, the documentary ultimately raises the need for a national rethink on a more proactive, rather then reactive, approach to natural disaster. With similar stories of inadequate emergency housing provisions playing out across flood-ravaged NSW and Queensland, it is clear that any community disaster and emergency planning needs to be well co-ordinated with all layers of government to avoid bureaucratic hold ups. ""What I think the documentary does really well is to present a really truthful account from a number of people of what Mallacoota has being going through,"" said CFA member Lyn Harwood, who helped to set up MADRA. ""It presents, for people, a really obvious process that any community is able to follow that gives them power after some kind of trauma.""

243,Mop & Dropouts bass guitarist remembered as 'great Indigenous man',arts-culture,"  Mop & The Dropouts bass guitarist Robert 'Bimbo' Duncan remembered as 'great Indigenous man' Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Warning: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains the name and images of people who have died. The late musician's daughter has granted permission for the ABC to use his name and image. Aboriginal rights champion and Mop & The Dropouts bass guitarist Uncle Robert ""Bimbo"" Duncan has died just a day after the band's legacy was recognised. The band, which influenced generations of Indigenous singer-songwriters and musicians, was honoured with the QMusic Lifetime Achievement Award at the Queensland Music Awards last week. The following day, Uncle Bimbo, 67, a Koa and Gungarri man, died peacefully in aged care, surrounded by family in Cherbourg, the town where he was born in 1954. Uncle Bimbo's daughter Natasha Duncan said she believed her dad ""just knew it was time to go"". Ms Duncan said he was ""an entertainer until the end"". Dennis ""Mop"" Conlon wrote it so Aboriginal rights wouldn't become yesterday's news. ""He's our entertainer. He's our emcee for every party and every funeral,"" she said. ""He's our entertainer and he's the one that's always got the mic and making jokes and telling tall stories. ""He was the person that the community looked for to be the emcee of certain events, for the football, and the netball and touch because all of his children played a part in all those events as well."" He joined the Mop & The Dropouts, led by singer Dennis ""Mop"" Conlon, in his 20s, and would play in the band until about two years ago, when he became ill. When worldwide attention was focused on Brisbane during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, First Nations protesters took the opportunity to march against racism. After watching news coverage of the protests and the arrests that followed, Uncle Mop wrote the iconic song Brisbane Blacks — a genuine depiction of life as an Aboriginal person in Queensland during the 1980s. Like Uncle Mop, Uncle Bimbo didn't consider himself political but rather a community man with a love of music. Uncle Mop said he shared non-stop laughs with Bimbo on every tour. ""He enjoyed every moment on stage — it was like his home,"" he said. ""We knew how to make music with the nod of our heads or the raising of an eyebrow, that's how we made music."" Committed to community-led healthcare, Bimbo also worked at the Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Community Health Service (ATSICHS) in Brisbane for more than a decade. Uncle Bimbo, a Koa traditional owner, also helped lead the decades-long fight to reclaim native title recognition for the nearly 865,000 hectares of land near Corfield, Winton and Kynuna — which was successfully determined last year. Ms Duncan said playing in the band ""was his big passion'' and ""the biggest part of his life"". ""I think it was just the fact that he was part of something else, something bigger, and you know boys from Cherbourg, young fellas from Cherbourg, making a name for themselves,"" she said. ""They went all over Australia. ""They travelled to all of the tiny towns and places to play their music and share their music. Murris and Kooris and Noongars and other mobs ... they all knew the songs, the Mop & The Dropout songs, so that was just amazing. ""I think he will be very dearly missed by everyone, not just the close family and immediate family, but by the community."" Ms Duncan said people in the community were asking who was going to emcee, tell jokes and speak at events now. With music an ever-present part of life, his mother Lenics Duncan Neetye gave him the nickname ""Bimbo"" after the Jim Reeves song she loved by the same name. His regular, treasured renditions of the Rolling Stones song Honky Tonk Women at gatherings have fondly been recalled by his loved ones. ""All the women would just all get up no matter what age, young and old, they'd all be singing and dancing and cooeeing out, and he'd be singing out all their names, making everybody feel very special,"" Ms Duncan said. Band members Uncle Ronald ""Crow"" Conlon and Uncle Billy ""Yowie"" Gorham said Bimbo had a special way of communicating on stage. They said he if raised an eyebrow, he was telling them to play faster, and if he dropped an eyebrow, it meant slow down. ""I used to look at Bimbo all the time, and if you were doing OK, he'd nod … that's how we learnt,"" Uncle Billy said. ""I see Bimbo as a really, great, great Indigenous man. He had a lot of wisdom, he was a jokey fella, he always played jokes on all the band members. ""You could always hear his laugh because he's so loud and his laugh was contagious."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Uncle Crow added that you would hear Bimbo before you could see him. ""You'd hear his laugh in there and know he's not too far away,"" he said. ""Bimbo was for me, when I first met him, you know — the bass man — somebody to look up to, the same as Uncle Charlie, Uncle Robin. ""We can't read music and all that stuff, but watching Bimbo play and listening to his style, you just sort of pick it up, pick the bass up and learn from him."" In a statement, the QMusic team sent their love and condolences to the family. ""The QMusic Lifetime Achievement Award acknowledges the band's place in history and their important work in using music to draw attention to racism and oppression experienced by First Australians,"" the statement said.

244,"How this fake Kim Jong Un helped a Zelenskyy impersonator to flee Ukraine, with the help of pretend Putin",arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It's jarring to hear Howard X, the Australian Kim Jong Un impersonator, describe being assaulted by North Korean agents as ""a great experience"". Mr X (his pseudonym) attended the 2018 South Korea Winter Olympics dressed as the North Korean leader, and says agents ""pushed me around"" in front of cameras. The media attention it drew ""expose[d] what a kind of thuggish regime North Korea is"", he says. Addressing humanitarian issues is part of his MO. More than just a gig for gags, impersonation is his vehicle for political satire, and Mr X says it allows him to say and do things others can't. ""All of us impersonators poke fun at the people we impersonate. Especially me. I don't glorify Kim Jong Un, I do the opposite,"" he tells ABC RN's Sunday Extra. ""When you use satire, it gets through all the BS."" But impersonation is also a job that carries significant risk. ""If I ever go to North Korea, I will be killed,"" Mr X says. And more than once he's intervened to help fellow world leader impersonators at risk to flee persecution in their countries. Mx X, who is based in Hong Kong but emigrated to Australia as a child in the 1990s, knew he was onto something the first time Kim Jong Un came on TV after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in 2011. ""I looked at his picture and thought, 'Oh, crap, I look like him'. Then everybody started saying the same thing."" Sunday Extra presents a lively mix of national and international affairs, analysis and investigation. He tried his likeness out in public for April Fool's Day in 2013 and posted the photos online. It was the start of a new career. ""Within two weeks, I got a call to go to Israel and make an advertisement,"" he says. Work has been steady ever since, including for TV, music videos and public events. But he's also been busy with humanitarian work. As strange as it is to think of a fake Kim Jong Un turning to a pretend Putin to get a lookalike Zelenskyy out of war-ravaged Ukraine, that's exactly what recently happened. ""I'm hoping they'll make a movie out of this, because it's just so crazy,"" Mr X says. Umid Isabaev is from Uzbekistan but had been living in Ukraine after an image of him asleep on a Russian train went viral. He shot to fame thanks to his uncanny likeness to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In a surprise twist, production staff working on the Ukrainian TV political satire Servant of the People, which stars Mr Zelenskyy, who also created and produced it, then invited Isabaev to work as Mr Zelenskyy's double on the show. ""If you look at the TV series, the second half of the third season, you will see Umid doing all the faraway shots,"" Mr X says. Mr X became aware of Mr Isabaev's work after the two appeared in a Russian documentary on impersonators around the world. When Russia invaded the Ukraine, Mr X wanted to check how his peer was faring. ""I rang up and he happened to be in Kiev. I said, 'What the hell are you doing? You need to get the f**k out of there',"" Mr X says. To help get Mr Isabaev safely out of the country, he enlisted the help of another peer, a Polish Vladimir Putin impersonator who goes by the name of Steve Poland. None of the men speak the same language so friends had to step in to act as translators. ""[Mr Isabaev] didn't know who we were. He was kind of mistrusting when I called him up,"" Mr X says. ""I had to really convince him: 'Look, we're not working for the Russians, we're not working for the Ukrainians. We are just impersonators.' ""I told him, 'Look, you can see me on video, you know what I look like. And you can see the guy who plays Putin. We just want to save you because we consider you a colleague' … [and] because the Russians were actually after him."" Mr X says Putin impersonator Mr Poland had contacts within the Ukrainian resistance and found ""somebody to go all the way into Kiev and get [Mr Isabaev] out"". ""It took a lot of effort [but] we got him out of there."" Mr Isabaev is not the only impersonator Mr X has helped to flee a war-ravaged country. Afghan Bruce Lee impersonator, Abbas Alizada is ""probably the best Bruce Lee impersonator I know"", Mr X says. ""Not only does he look like him, but he spent his whole life practising martial arts."" He says Mr Alizada became unsafe when Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in 2021. ""He was stuck in Kabul and the Taliban was actually looking for him. They tried to go to his house two times to kill him,"" Mr X says. ""He escaped and my role was getting all the money together to help him escape."" He says Mr Alizada is now in a hostel with other Afghan refugees, waiting for an immigration application to Australia to be assessed. Mr X says he'll keep trying to assist persecuted impersonators and, with them, try to draw attention to humanitarian issues around the world. But he's also a businessman who is serious about earning a living impersonating Kim Jong Un. And he's unafraid of ruffling feathers with some of his stunts, because, he says, ""it's all good press. Because of that, you get work"". ""I don't get tired of it. In fact, being a political impersonator of Kim Jong, I get away [with] saying things that no other impersonator, and nobody else, could get away with.""

246,'Fill the silence with your music': Ukrainian president's video plea at the Grammys. Tributes paid to Taylor Hawkins,arts-culture,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appeared in a pre-taped speech at the Grammys. Mr Zelenskyy was introducing a tribute performance for Ukraine by John Legend, saying ""Fill the silence with your music"". Mr Zelenskyy started his address by outlining what Russia's invasion of Ukraine has meant for his country. ""The war. ""What is more opposite to music? ""The silence of ruined cities and killed people. ""Our children draw swooping rockets, not shooting stars."" He said 153 children had died and more than 400 children had been injured. ""Our musicians wear body armour instead of tuxedos. ""They sing to the wounded in hospitals."" He urged musicians at the Grammys to ""fill the silence with your music."" ""Fill it today. ""To tell our story."" Mr Zelenskyy urged the media and people on social media to ""tell the truth about this war."" ""Support us in any way you can. ""Any — but not silence."" John Legend performed Free with Ukrainian exiles including singer-actress Mika Newton and poet Lyuba Yakimchuk. The Grammys ceremony included a tribute to those in the industry who had died recently, including the late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, with singer Billie Eilish wearing a T-shirt honouring Hawkins when she performed. The Foo Fighters won three Grammys — Best Rock Performance, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Album. They had cancelled their scheduled performance ahead of the show. There were a few references made about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at that other major awards ceremony — the Oscars. Host Trevor Noah told the audience at the start of the show that there was lots to look forward to. ""We're going to be keeping people's names out of our mouths,"" he said to nervous laughter from the audience. When multiple-Grammy award winner and Oscar-winning Director Questlove took to the stage, he also alluded to the incident. ""I'm going to present this award and I trust that you people stay 500 feet away from me."" Questlove received an award from Chris Rock immediately after the Oscars slap last week. Australians RÜFÜS DU SOL won their first Grammy, winning Best Dance/Electronic Recording for their single Alive. The 64th annual Grammys were reasonably free from controversy, except for when musician, record producer and DJ Dillon Francis walked down the red carpet in a T-shirt, holding a plastic shopping bag. Dillon explained in a Tweet that he went shopping and when he arrived back at his hotel, ran into American DJ Diplo in the lobby and received a late invitation to the Grammys. ""So I'm like screw it I'll go. ""I didn't think we were gonna walk the red carpet until we ended up walking the red carpet,"" he wrote.

247,Philip was a child soldier in South Sudan. This is what he wants Australians to know,arts-culture,"  South Sudan former child soldier Philip Lako shares story to inspire other WA migrants Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Storytelling is said to be the oldest form of education. Throughout history, storytelling has bridged the gap between generations, often delivering both entertainment and a lesson. Even when the subject matter is painful, communicating lived experience to others is something that people are drawn to; storytelling is healing for both the speaker and listener. Public speaker, advocate and author Philip Lako has spent recent years sharing his story in the hope it will help people better understand the experience of migrants to Australia. Philip spent his early childhood living with his family in a small village in South Sudan. At the age of 10, he was taken by rebels under the guise of receiving an education. Instead, he was kept and trained as a child soldier; for a decade, Philip was subjected to starvation and abuse at the hands of the adults who were supposed to be his caregivers. Philip finally managed to escape to Kenya as a refugee, the beginning of what was to be an incredibly difficult four-year journey that eventually brought him to Australia. In the years that followed, Philip went through a process many migrants to Australia are familiar with, and starting from scratch but motivated by hope, he set about building a life in a foreign country. When asked why he now dedicates his energy to sharing such a difficult story, Philip says, ""It's definitely not easy … but of course we have to make some sacrifices."" ""[It's] more about the people that are listening; the people that are going to hear this story."" Philip explains that in sharing his story he hopes to bridge a gap between migrants and listeners who had not lived his experience. ""These are stories worth telling to remind those people, people that have never seen the other side of life … how other people live in those countries,"" he says. ""Developed countries have [lived] comfortably for very long, and sometimes people easily get removed from the reality of life."" Philip says he believes anyone who calls Australia home should make the effort to get to know people from other communities better. ""We are all human. We might look different, but every single person has the intent to have a good life, to have security, to be able to wake up and not have to worry about being bombarded,"" he says. Philip says compassion is key to making Australia a place people from all backgrounds can call home. ""This is the life circle, people go through these hurdles but the reality is everyone wants to get out of that, to get a better life,"" he says. ""We need to give people a second chance."" Despite being a society that outwardly prides itself on its multiculturalism, migrant stories have long been marginalised in Australia, but the push for migrant voices to be heard is gaining momentum. Zambian-Australian poet Taonga Sendama is a Perth-based writer and storytelling mentor who has performed all over Australia. Taonga has also run workshops through Perth Poetry Festival, and for students in schools and university clubs. Much of her work is centred around identity, and why sharing stories of identity is so important. Taonga describes storytelling as ""how we continue our cultures; how we communicate and … how we hold each other in the communities that we build"". The reason she shares her work, Taonga explains, is so those in migrant communities are reminded that other people have been through similar experiences and that they are far from alone. ""I tell stories for the sake of other people like me who might not have heard these stories,"" she says. Taonga says there is an unfair expectation of migrant folks to tell stories that adhere to ""certain tropes and narratives"". ""There's no stories about love or nostalgia … you have to fit into very specific boxes,"" she says. ""We are such multifaceted people that I feel like it's impossible … to expect us to fit into such small things."" ""[In my mentoring] I reassure people that no, you don't have to get up onto this platform and bleed onto a stage to be listened to or recognised, you can just talk about your love life, your friends and how much you love them."" Taonga speaks to the healing power of storytelling for minority communities and how vital it is to stop intergenerational trauma being handed down. ""If we don't talk about these things, we are just going to pass it on to the next generation who, honestly, deserves to just live their lives freely and live with as much joy and rest as we can give them,"" she says. ""Storytelling is healing for both the listener and the person sharing … I think we really have to keep doing it, even though it hurts.""

248,"One of history’s strangest art heists comes to movie screens in smart, charming British comedy",arts-culture,"  The Duke brings British comedy charm and smarts to the true story of one of history’s strangest art heists Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog On August 21, 1961, a mystery thief broke into London's National Gallery and made off with Francisco Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, a painting recently acquired by the British Government to the then-cool tune of 140,000 British pounds. Baffled authorities assumed the robbery to be the work of master criminals; little did they know the culprit was a 60-year-old pensioner from Newcastle by the name of Kempton Bunton. Or so he led everyone to believe. It was a burglary so brazen that it captured the attention of a nation. A replica of the missing painting even showed up as a sight gag in the original James Bond film, 1962's Dr. No, at a time when detectives were so confounded that an arch supervillain may as well have been a plausible suspect. Bond makes a cameo in The Duke, a lightly fictionalised film about the Novocastrian art thief that transforms him into something of a folk hero – at least as played by a winning Jim Broadbent, who brings the garrulous, idealistic Bunton to life in a performance of vivid wit and charm. The final feature from the late stage and screen director Roger Michell (Notting Hill; My Cousin Rachel), it's one of those films the British always seem to do so well: a jaunty historical tour spliced with a little cosy subversiveness; ever-so politely rowdy in a way that feels designed to capture cinema's lucrative older audience. That's not a criticism. The Duke is the kind of film that Hollywood, for better or worse, doesn't make anymore: smart, character-driven, a mischievous twinkle in the eye — a movie that can comfortably entertain an entire family without a glimpse of spandex. Broadbent is the heart and soul of the film as Bunton, the boisterous Newcastle pensioner who's the very definition of a 'character'. A war veteran, autodidact and wannabe playwright, he's also an anti-establishment agitator and self-styled champion of the common people, much to the chagrin of his — what else — long-suffering wife, Dorothy (Helen Mirren). ""Stop all your agitation,"" she pleads at one point, Mirren deftly sketching her weariness and exasperation. Bunton's contentious idealism makes it hard for him to hold down a job, while his adult sons (Fionn Whitehead and Jack Bandeira) dream and scheme and Dorothy takes work as a housekeeper. They've lost a daughter, something neither parent wants to talk about. It's almost certainly fuelling Bunton's heightened sense of the world's injustice. When we first meet him, this working class warrior is doing battle with the BBC over his campaign to provide free television licenses for the elderly and veterans – a crusade that briefly lands him in the dock. Tops Arts & Culture headlines. Bunton could come off as deeply, insufferably righteous in the wrong hands, but Broadbent plays this would-be Robin Hood with a full, magnanimous serve of irresistible Northern humour, while also suggesting a man whose inability to confront loss might be sending him around the bend. By the time he arrives in London to protest TV licensing, we fully believe he's a man capable of slipping off to the National Gallery and swiping the expensive artwork he regards as a shameful waste of public funds. ""Toffs looking after their own,"" Bunton mutters, ""spending our hard-earned money on a half-baked portrait by some Spanish drunk, of a Duke who was a bastard to his men and who voted against universal suffrage."" The line is characteristic of a screenplay, penned by playwrights Richard Bean and Clive Coleman, that's sprinkled with cheerful anti-establishment jibes, and which delights in lampooning a clueless police department convinced that the robbery must be the work of a devious, cleverly orchestrated crime gang — or, in one of the movie's dry running gags, Italians. Michell delivers most of this as light comedy, with recurring split-screen mosaics and a vaguely jazzy score (by veteran composer George Fenton) that's in clear dialogue with 60s Hollywood's fondness for art heists (it's a wonder Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers never got their hands on this story). Yet The Duke is less a caper than a tale of class angst. The film has plenty to say on working class England and the limits of activism, even as it embodies the paradox of its own breezy, tasteful style — historical radicalism seen through the safe lens of chipper, entertaining period nostalgia. And while Bunton is, in many ways, a classic idealist whose dedication to the so-called common good means he neglects the people around him, Michell and Broadbent eventually flatten those contradictions as they tilt him toward beloved folk hero — complete with a grandstanding bit of courtroom buffoonery and a feel-good peanut gallery chorus right out of a Frank Capra movie. It's hard to buy into the movie's faith in collective humanity when its designs are so corny, but as a piece of entertainment — with an admirably cheeky pro-theft message — it's extremely satisfying. The Duke is in cinemas now. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

249,Not just cricket: Do you know the story of Australia's first sports team to tour overseas?,arts-culture,"  First XI of 1868: The story of the all-Aboriginal cricket side that was Australia's first sports team to tour overseas Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When thousands of people from across the world attended the public memorial for Shane Warne at the MCG, the day of love and legacy was further proof of how Australia's identity is inextricably linked with the stories of its athletes. But Warne's was not the only sporting story commemorated in Victoria last week that offered a glimpse into who we are. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised this story contains an image of people who have died. The tale of Australia's first sports team to tour overseas, an all-Aboriginal cricket side known as the First XI of 1868, was brought to life in a performance by an entirely Indigenous cast. The play Black Cockatoo tells the story of 13 cricket players who learned the game from the west Wimmera settlers whose farms they worked on. Partly trained by British cricketer Charles Lawrence and Australian Rules football founder Tom Wills, the men played across Victoria before being smuggled out of the state to play in the UK. With dazzling athleticism, they won or drew 33 of the 47 games they played against British sides in 1868, even while mourning the death of teammate King Cole from tuberculosis. The play is a tale of triumph, racism, exploitation, illness, culture clash and truth, and references the intense discussion among Indigenous Australians over what they want to achieve with truth-telling. Director Wesley Enoch says having an entirely Indigenous cast, even for white characters, ensures First Nations people own the story that means so much to them. ""I think we are in a phase of history now around ideas of sovereignty and treaty, and art and sport have always played a very important role in making sure stories are being told,"" he says. As one of the actors, Joseph Althouse, says, ""In Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal Australia, we are still asking these questions of how our old people found the courage and the strength to survive. So to have this story, it really is a beautiful metaphor"". A 30-year reunion of Australia's second all-Indigenous cricket team gives players hope their contribution will finally be recognised. In the play, young Indigenous activists sneak into the Wimmera Discovery Centre, and uncover the truth of what happened to Jardwadjali man Unaarrimin — also known as Johnny Mullagh — and his cricket team. On Saturday night, hundreds of people watched the performance on Johnny Mullagh Oval in Harrow, one of the towns where it all began, in the 1860s. Most of the plot of Black Cockatoo reflects exactly what happened. Wotjobaluk man Uncle Richard Kennedy, the play's cultural consultant, says when the players returned from England, they weren't treated like national heroes. ""They were just dumped in Sydney, they had to find their own way home,"" he says. ""They never got any pay at all even though they were promised 50 pounds each. They did make some money when they demonstrated their skills at shows after the cricket match, but the tour wasn't profitable. ""They thought it would be a way of making money so they could support their families back in Australia, that's probably one of the reasons why they did it."" Many in the team had to live out their days in missions created while they were overseas, as part of the Victorian Aboriginal Protection Act. ""They were meant to go onto missions to Christianise them and also protect them and help them live their lives because everyone thought [Indigenous people] were going to die out,"" Uncle Richard says. The group's star, Johnny Mullagh, continued playing cricket in Victoria on his return, and lived out his days at a waterhole near Harrow. His grave, which venerates him as a world-renowned athlete, lies in the cemetery overlooking the town. An Indigenous cricketing pioneer many people have never heard of will be remembered at the Boxing Day Test from next year. Black Cockatoo is the latest in a series of initiatives to better recognise the First XI's story. In the nearby centre of Horsham, a silo will be painted later this year to commemorate the story of a member of the team, Yanggendyinanyuk, also known as Dick-A-Dick. Along with two other Indigenous trackers, Dick-A-Dick saved three children lost in Victoria's desert in 1864. Meanwhile, the best player in Melbourne's Boxing Day Test now wins the Johnny Mullagh medal. Last year, it was won by Indigenous bowler Scott Boland. Before he created his own piece of sporting history, taking 6/7 off four overs on the third day, Boland visited Harrow in 2018 as part of the 150th anniversary of the First XI tour. The 32-year-old is only the second Indigenous man to play test cricket for Australia. But Justin Mohamed, co-chair of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cricket Advisory Council, is confident he won't be the last. ""We have a number of players now coming through to that elite level, which wasn't the case a number of years ago and the question was why that hasn't happened,'"" he said. ""There is a plan in place for bringing back those very strong links Aboriginal communities have with cricket, and recognising the story of the First XI is one of them."" Cricket Australia data suggests from 2017-18 to 2020-21, participation in the sport among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people nationwide grew by 23 per cent. Aside from Boland, there were four other male and five female Indigenous cricketers in the most recent Big Bash seasons. One of them, Ash Gardner, played in Sunday's Women's World Cup win over England. Uncle Richard is a descendent of Dick-A-Dick's, and he says it's important that when the story is told, the less pleasant aspects aren't omitted. ""The whole thing is, I think, a way of giving everybody in Australia the history of Australia, because it is part of our history, and part of cricket,"" he says. ""They were taken across as skilled people, they learned the game within four years of picking it up, and toured England. ""That's an amazing feat and it just shows their skills and ability to be able to adapt to any sort of conditions, and it's something we've carried on down the ages until now."" The play's run of shows down the east coast comes at a critical point in Victoria's relationship with its past. Eleven days ago, the Yoorrook Justice Commission, Australia's first-ever Indigenous truth-telling exercise, began hearing evidence of the intergenerational trauma suffered by First Nations people during and after colonisation. Mr Enoch is hopeful that in coming years, the town of Harrow and the Boxing Day Test (and Black Cockatoo) won't be the only places giving due credit to the story of the First XI. ""What I'm hearing a lot from audiences is a sense of, 'How come I didn't know about this?'"" he says. “I like to think that what we will see in the future is every time we hit a ball with a bat, we will go, 'Oh hey, remember that story from 1868?'""

251,"First-edition books can be worth thousands, but beware of 'mongrel sets'",arts-culture,"  Book collectors warned of 'mongrel sets' as seller searches for 80yo Famous Five dust jackets Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It takes a keen eye to know what you're buying as a book collector, and while a first edition could be worth thousands of dollars, as the saying goes, you can't always judge a book by its cover. Mistakes can be made when pairing books with dust jackets, potentially eroding collectors' investments, and one antiquarian book collector says it's a case of buyer beware. ""First-edition books are a great thing to get into if you want to put your money into something that you don't lose on, because there will never be more of them,"" says Andrea Boltresz, owner of Armchair Adventures in Robertson, New South Wales. ""Every year they continue to climb in value."" One example is Enid Blyton's book Five On A Treasure Island. First published in 1942, it's the most valuable in the Famous Five series. ""A serious collector is going to pay between $8,000 and $10,000 for one of those first editions,"" Ms Boltresz says. ""If there is anyone out there with a Five On A Treasure Island first edition, they should be really excited. ""And they should really look after it too, especially if it has its jacket with it."" Having been reprinted 40 times since its publication 80 years ago, Five On A Treasure Island has a multitude of book and dust-jacket combinations. And that's where collectors can come unstuck. With about 10,000 books in stock, Ms Boltresz's business specialises in rare and fine bindings, plus vintage collectibles, and services private collectors who don't necessarily want to visit the shop to browse. Instead, the business attends auctions on their behalf. ""We've found a lot of collectors of children's books, vintage children's books in particular, which is a huge area to collect in and very interesting,"" she says. High-end collectors look for really pristine copies. ""If they are looking for a first edition, they are expecting that book to be the correct edition, with the correct dust jacket, and that dust jacket will be absolutely pristine, not a nibble out of it or a scratch anywhere,"" Ms Boltresz says. ""If it came originally with a dust wrapper, that's where the value is, and if you don't have the dust wrapper for the book, it will be worth significantly less than half what it would be otherwise. ""It's hard to find good copies that are really clean and still have dust wrappers that haven't been destroyed."" Ms Boltresz says her job never ceases to be fascinating. ""People leave things in books all the time; it's actually one of the great joys of being a second-hand book dealer."" While attending a Sydney auction, Ms Boltresz recently purchased 100 books, many of which included notes from the former owner about what they had done with the dust jackets. ""In this case, he's taken them off and put them on other editions because what he wanted to do was create a complete set of what looked like first editions, to sell as a set,"" she says. ""But … this person has inadvertently mixed up different editions with different dust jackets without realising what they were doing. ""Somewhere out there, someone has just bought a lovely set of Famous Fives that they think are first editions. ""But many of them can't be because we know the jackets aren't right as we have some of the books in our collection that belong to those jackets. ""They clearly understood that the dust jackets were valuable, but they've swapped damaged books for cleaner versions and haven't looked to see that it's exactly the same impression as the one that was originally with the jacket. ""What they really have is a mongrel set."" The wrong jacket with the wrong book means an $800 first edition is suddenly a $200 book, Ms Boltresz says. Ms Boltresz says determining a book's value is easier than you think, once you know how to read the signs. Ways of telling that jackets and books don't belong together include checking that the list of titles are in the same order and identifying different graphic styles, including font usage and page layout. If the font on the cover is different from the page, that is an indicator too. But Ms Boltresz says the most important thing is to do your research on a book before you go to buy … or sell it. ""Then you know that everything about it is represented clearly and people know exactly what they are getting,"" she says. ""Some collectors can tolerate anomalies while others do not.""

252,"This woman has terminal cancer. Her 'fun, bright and light' book aims to help families talk about it ",arts-culture,"  Queensland mum with terminal cancer writes Pink Punk Mum to help parents talk to children about illness Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Kala Heinemann was still breastfeeding her youngest child, she noticed a lump in her breast. She saw a doctor, but it was dismissed as ""something that happens with breastfeeding"", while a scan revealed nothing. So she went on with life. ""Then I started getting a lot of pain in my body, and things just weren't right,"" Ms Heinemann said. ""It got to a point where something needed to be done, so I went one day for a scan, and I was diagnosed straight up with breast cancer. ""Unfortunately, by that stage, it had spread. So it was metastatic breast cancer, which is stage four."" The Central Queensland woman said she had always wanted to write children's books, but she was pulled away to other dreams, studying international law and living overseas with her family. Ms Heinemann was diagnosed while she was living in Israel in 2018. Last year, she moved back to Australia to live in Emu Park, having grown up in Rockhampton. The mother-of-two said she saw her diagnosis as an opportunity to write her first book, Pink Punk Mum, about a child helping his mum through cancer diagnosis and treatment. ""It sounds quite heavy, but it's actually a really fun, bright and light book. There's lot of joy. There's lots of hope,"" she said. ""In the story itself, I don't get too much into what cancer is and how it affects women in a medical way, but I do talk a lot about the side effects. ""How treatment makes you very tired, or how mums aren't always then available for the kids to play with."" Ms Heinemann used the book to talk to her own children, now eight and five, about her health. ""It's a really, really hard thing to talk about with your kids, especially when they're little and they don't understand,"" she said. ""They knew I was tired from my sickness, but I hadn't really mentioned cancer … I felt they were too young to burden them with big words and ideas like that. ""There are obvious things like losing hair. There's nothing you can do to hide that from your kids. You've lost all your hair, and that's something that needs to be discussed."" Mimicking her own experience, the book shows a mum losing her hair only to grow it back, dye it pink and rock a mohawk. Ms Heinemann said she hoped the book helped at least one other family have a conversation about cancer and feel hopeful about what lay ahead. ""To give someone a laugh, bring a little bit of joy, to bring a bit of lightness to what is a really dark situation … that would be wonderful,"" she said. CQ University psychologist Cassy Dittman said stories like these were particularly useful for young children. ""Stories or resources are really, really helpful for them to get a more concrete sense of what the future might hold for them, and might hold for their parent or family member,"" Dr Dittman said. She advised parents to be as open and honest with children as possible and to set aside a time to talk to them. ""It's about turning off all other distractions, sitting down with them in a place where they feel comfortable and happy, or even doing it in a place where you're not face to face … like going for a walk,"" Dr Dittman said. ""Find out if they've got any questions about what they are going to expect. ""They're trying to predict the future, so it might be simple things like, 'Well, who's going to pick me up from school?'"" She says parents should be alert, follow their child's lead if they have questions, and give children time to process the news.

255,"Popular NT children's book series about to hit the small screen, 20 years on ",arts-culture,"  Darwin author Leonie Norrington's book series The Barrumbi Kids to become TV show Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Northern Territory author Leonie Norrington has some simple advice for budding writers: look to your own life and share it. ""Use your own experience, your own landscape, your own people to feed your work,"" she said. ""That's the essential part of you and the essential part of where you come from."" The author has done just that, turning her childhood memories of growing up in an Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory into books for children. Her most popular series The Barrumbi Kids was published in 2002, and follows a group of friends who learn about themselves through hunting and fishing in the bush. Two decades on, her books are about to reach a new audience on the small screen, with National Indigenous Television (NITV) commissioning The Barrumbi Kids to be turned into a TV show in 2022. The author travelled to Beswick south-east of Katherine for the filming and hopes  the ""wonderful relationship between black people and white people"" comes across on screen. ""So often the information that comes out of communities is negative and it's not all negative at all, there's such joy,"" she said. Being on set was art imitating life for the 65-year-old author, who spent the early years of her life living on the same Jawoyn country where the TV show was filmed. The third of nine children, Norrington credits her childhood spent in the tiny community of Barunga in the 1960s for having the ""biggest influence"" on her career. She said finding ways to celebrate ""the difference but sameness between cultures"" had been the cornerstone of her work as a writer. ""It was a really unique way to grow up, growing up in the bush with people who were living mostly a traditional way with their customs and hunting all the time,"" she said. ""All of us children just ran around the bush with them; it was a really wonderful, exciting life."" The Darwin author says feeling ""like the minority"" in the community had had a profound impact on her work as a writer. ""There weren't that many white people who looked like me on the community,"" she said. ""I think that's a really valuable thing as a writer to always know that you don't know, to always be on the outside somehow."" It was the birth of her first grandson on the other end of the country that inspired the former ABC Gardening Australia presenter to start writing books for children. ""I wanted him to know what it was like to live in the territory,"" she said. ""I want stories for our kids, stories that legitimate who we are as a people."" Norrington has finished her doctorate in literature, writing her first adult novel set in Blue Mud Bay in Arnhem Land in pre-colonial times. She said she was inspired to write the novel by her late 'Aboriginal mother' Clair Bush, a Yolngu woman who took her under her wing when she was a child. ""It was a serious adoption, she looked after us...she's the one who taught us and the one I've written under her supervision all these years,"" she said. ""Her mission was to have remote Aboriginal people shown as really powerful strong characters."" Norrington credits Ms Bush as being the powerhouse behind the success of The Barrumbi Kids, and said she would have been proud to see the stories from Barunga make national television.
