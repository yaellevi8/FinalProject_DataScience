0,Some of us are more vulnerable to mould allergies than others. Here's what symptoms to look out for,health," Health What are the health effects of mould, and how do you get rid of it? After months of heavy rainfall and increased humidity along Australia's east coast, many people are now dealing with an unwelcome and often stubborn house guest: mould. A type of fungus, mould is present almost everywhere. It lives on plant and animal matter and plays an important role in our ecosystem. But mould growth inside the home, often brought on by flood damage, plumbing leaks or damp and humid conditions, can be damaging to our health, especially when left unchecked. ""There's always mould in every house, but it needs dampness to grow, and there's a lot [of dampness] at the moment because of the floods and rain,"" said Holly Jones, a researcher in the healthy housing unit at Melbourne University's school of population and global health. ""What causes illness is certain species of mould being more concentrated … so by keeping your house dry, you're keeping that in check."" Mould can affect everything from clothing to furniture, and is often noticeable as a stain, smudge or discoloured patch. But it can also be harder to find — behind furniture, at the back of wardrobes, and even inside wall cavities, says architectural scientist Tim Law of Victoria University. ""The problem is mould is not always visible: it tends to grow in the dark, interstitial spaces of a building, so you may not be able to see it,"" said Dr Law, who researches how the microbiology of buildings can affect human health. ""You might be able to smell it, but otherwise, it's usually quite hard to detect."" In order to reproduce, mould spawns tiny particles called spores which are carried in the air. Sometimes, these can trigger allergy and respiratory symptoms such as nasal congestion, wheezing, watery or itchy eyes, coughing, and respiratory infections. Mould can also worsen asthma and allergic conditions. ""All of our organs and surfaces have barriers, and mould is something that can irritate those barriers and open up that junction,"" immunologist and allergy specialist Sheryl Van Nunen said. ""Mould can give you asthma, it can exacerbate your asthma, and it can keep your asthma going or have it become chronic."" For most people, exposure to a very small amount of mould does not have serious health consequences. But how you respond depends on your genetic makeup, underlying health, and how sensitive you are to mould. After months of wet weather, many people are struggling to contain mould. Here's how to get rid of it. Professor Van Nunen, who is also a spokesperson for the National Asthma Council, says approximately 40 per cent of Australians are atopic, meaning they have ""an inherent ability to be allergic"". People with allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions are more vulnerable to the health effects of mould, as are infants, children and older people. ""The thing that concerns me particularly is children … asthma has been clearly established as being associated with visible mould and mould odour,"" Professor Van Nunen said. ""One of the other really important findings is that if a pregnant woman is living in a mouldy home, [her] child has an increased risk of asthma."" People with weakened immune systems — such as cancer patients undergoing treatment or organ transplant recipients — are also at risk of more serious complications, including rare but severe mould infections in the lungs. Dr Law stressed that in large quantities, mould spores can cause ill health in almost anyone. ""At some point, you can have enough mould in the building so that nobody is going to remain healthy under those conditions,"" he said. In addition to established respiratory symptoms, mould exposure has also been linked to a biotoxin-related illness known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, or CIRS. CIRS is a progressive multi-system illness characterised by exposure to biotoxins, Dr Law said. Symptoms are reported to include headaches, chronic fatigue, mood swings, allergies and night sweats. ""For a lot of people who have suffered this condition, it took them a long time to make the connection between their condition and the building [they inhabited],"" Dr Law said. ""One of the clearest indicators is if people go on holiday and live in a different environment and then suddenly feel very refreshed, and when they come back to their house or office, they feel it all over again."" But CIRS is not a widely recognised medical condition, and many doctors treat it with ""a certain amount of suspicion"", Dr Law says. What rights do renters have when it comes to mould growth and who should remove it? A 2018 parliamentary inquiry into CIRS called for more research into the potential health effects of mould, after medical experts noted a lack of evidence showing a causal relationship between ""exposure to biotoxins and unexplained complex symptoms"". Ms Jones said one of the key barriers to understanding CIRS was the difficulty researchers faced when trying to measure mould exposure. ""It's not like doing a blood test — [the amount of mould is] going to be different based on the season, who lives in the house, whether there is a cat or dog, whether someone's been for a walk in nature in the last week,"" she said. ""So that's what I'm focusing on, because once you can measure how much people are exposed … you can see whether there is causal evidence."" Dr Law is also part of a research team funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) investigating whether there are clear biomarkers associated with CIRS. ""We hope to really gain some traction with the NHMRC funding and work out a way to screen for it."" While some of the health impacts of mould exposure are still to be determined, Ms Jones says it's widely recognised that poor housing quality, including mouldy and damp living conditions, increases the risk of poor health outcomes. The World Health Organization has previously estimated that mould affects between 10 and 50 per cent of homes in Australia. Research suggests these are more likely to be in low-income communities. ""The WHO says there is no safe level of exposure to the toxins from mould,"" she said. Well-designed and well-maintained homes are critical to the prevention of mould, but Dr Law says a lack of agreed exposure standards means measures to ensure adequate ventilation and to limit condensation aren't always enforced. ""Very often, these things are not dealt with, and the occupant is the one that bears the consequences of mould and so forth,"" he said. ""Given how prevalent mould already is … we really need to look at this more carefully."" Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice. Where possible, it's important people remove any mould growth in their home, and take steps to prevent it from growing back, Ms Jones says. ""The number one thing is to keep your house dry: prevent moisture in any way you can … that could be with dehumidifiers, or with ventilation. ""And check the tenancy regulations in your state if you're a renter. ""They vary state by state, but a few states do say if it's a structural problem that causes mould, it's the landlord's responsibility to fix it."" In addition to reducing the amount of moisture, Professor Van Nunen recommended people use a vinegar solution to remove mould instead of bleach. ""In most cases, if you use bleach, a background level of mould spores will remain and you're not really getting rid of it. Whereas vinegar will do it."" It's also important to remember that in some cases, when the mould is widespread or your health is being compromised, it may be necessary to bring in professional help.

1,'She wastes cassava': Navigating infertility in the Pacific ,health,"  Lice Movono's fertility issues set 'tongues wagging' — so just how difficult is it for Pacific Island women who want to have children? Pacific Islanders are renowned for having big, tight-knit families, but this notion can create problems for women who struggle with fertility. Little is known about the extent of infertility in the Pacific Islands due to under-reporting and a lack of research. However, one paper in 2018 explored Pacific Islander women's infertility experiences in New Zealand. It found this marginalised group was often stereotyped as being ""hyper-fertile"", compounding the stigma attached to the issue of infertility. Gender, culture and religion also helped reinforce this notion, making matters worse for Pacific Islander women. Hilda Wayne finds out what it is like to struggle with infertility in cultures that value big families. In her early 20s, a routine check-up led Fijian journalist Lice Movono down a path of surgeries and medication in order to have children. It was a large, painful cyst on her ovary that prompted the treatment and fast-tracked thoughts about having a family of her own — her then-partner already had children that she had ""taken to very quickly, very naturally"". However, as she approached her late 20s, Ms Movono said ""tongues started wagging"" and nasty remarks from family — both immediate and extended — intensified. ""In Fiji, there's a derogatory joke that goes around when a woman can't have children – they say, 'She wastes cassava', meaning food is wasted on her because she's not going to give you children,"" she said. ""It was, at that time, a source of a lot of tension or friction between my partner and I and, eventually, my in-laws. Ms Movono used a ""little window"" of time to try to to conceive. ""At the time, I just couldn't fathom the idea that, if I left it too late, I wouldn't be able to have kids,"" she said. Amid the full-time reporting, study and ongoing pain associated with her surgeries, Ms Movono fell pregnant. Nine months later Esther was born. She was, admittedly, a ""huge baby"" who made for a challenging and traumatic delivery. ""I had her at about 39 weeks, and she was 4.6 kilograms because, of course, that's what I needed, to have a humungous baby to deal with,"" she joked. Despite the arduous journey to become a mother, Ms Movono said Esther was ""just the prettiest thing, the easiest baby"". Not long after, Ms Movono fell pregnant again with Esther's brother, Jacob. ""It was a pretty difficult journey,"" she said. ""I know a lot of women who will not talk about these issues because they're of a reproductive health nature and it has a taboo element attached to it,"" she said. Dr Edith Kariko is a Senior Health Specialist with the World Bank in Port Moresby. She said infertility stigma also affected women in Papua New Guinea because sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were a leading cause of fertility issues, and few women want to discuss it. Having control over your sexual and reproductive health is a human right, but research shows two-thirds of Pacific Island women who want to avoid or delay pregnancy are unable to do so. ""If you're a woman of reproductive age, you can't speak up about vaginal discharge or pains in the lower abdomen, pain with urination,"" she said. ""They wait until the last minute and that results in untreated STIs that have already caused complications [to a woman's fertility]."" Dr Kariko said sexual and reproductive health education in schools was inadequate and needed to be revised to create a ""culturally enabling environment"" for such conversations to take place. ""Having the awareness on where they can get help, or what is causing particular infertility, even for young people to discuss this openly before they get into relationships is really critical,"" she said. Dr Leeanne Panisi is the only female fertility specialist among a cohort of four in Solomon Islands and works at Honiara's National Referral Hospital. She said cultural practices such as 'bride price' were being abused in some cases to add pressure on women to conceive. ""There are certain communities where women are expected to get pregnant and have children because ... 'bride price' was paid and the families of the husband or the partner expect her to have children,"" she said. For the women who had exhausted all fertility options, Dr Panisi said, adoption within families was the next best thing. ""Usually the adoption is from a close relative or family member, but it can be also from somebody from a different culture or a distant relative,"" she said. Lealaiauloto Lia'i Si'itia is the director of the Samoa Family Health Association. In Samoa today, Lealaiauloto said women who could not afford to see specialists often sought help from traditional practitioners, despite their procedures being known to ""aggravate"" fertility issues. ""They come very late to family fertility centres because they first seek help from traditional practitioners, caregivers, nurses and sometimes churches,"" she said. ""[The view] is that [women] are not blessed with a child so they need to seek some spiritual blessings, advice and traditional healing.""

2,WHO holds emergency meeting to discuss monkeypox spread,health,"  WHO holds emergency meeting on monkeypox spread as Europe cases rise The World Health Organization (WHO) is holding an emergency meeting to discuss the recent outbreak of monkeypox, a viral infection more commonly seen in west and central Africa, after more than 100 cases have been confirmed or suspected in Europe. WARNING: Graphic images in this story may be distressing for some readers. In what Germany described as the largest outbreak in Europe ever, monkeypox cases have been reported in at least nine countries — Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom — as well as the United States, Canada and Australia. Spain reported 24 new cases on Friday, mainly in the Madrid region, where the regional government closed a sauna linked to the majority of infections. A hospital in Israel was treating a man in his 30s who is displaying symptoms consistent with the disease after recently arriving from Western Europe. First identified in monkeys, the disease typically spreads through close contact and has rarely spread outside Africa, so this series of cases has triggered concern. However, scientists do not expect the outbreak to evolve into a pandemic like COVID-19, given the virus does not spread as easily as SARS-CoV-2. Monkeypox is usually a mild viral illness, characterised by symptoms of fever as well as a distinctive bumpy rash of blisters that can burst, leaving craters. ""This is the largest and most widespread outbreak of monkeypox ever seen in Europe,"" said Germany's armed forces' medical service, which detected its first case in the country on Friday. A handful of monkeypox cases have been reported across Europe over the past few weeks, but what is this virus? The WHO committee meeting to discuss the issue is its strategic and technical advisory group on infectious hazards with pandemic and epidemic potential (STAG-IH), which advises on infection risks that could pose a global health threat. It would not be responsible for deciding whether the outbreak should be declared a public health emergency of international concern, WHO's highest form of alert, which is currently applied to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""There appears to be a low risk to the general public at this time,"" a senior US administration official said. Fabian Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute, described the outbreaks as an epidemic. ""However, it is very unlikely that this epidemic will last long. The cases can be well isolated via contact tracing and there are also drugs and effective vaccines that can be used if necessary,"" he said. Still, the WHO's European chief said he was concerned that infections could accelerate in the region as people gather for parties and festivals over the summer months. There is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, but data shows that the vaccines used to eradicate smallpox are up to 85 per cent effective against monkeypox, according to the WHO. British authorities said they have offered a smallpox vaccine to some healthcare workers and others who may have been exposed to monkeypox. Since 1970, monkeypox cases have been reported in 11 African countries. Nigeria has had a large, ongoing outbreak since 2017. So far this year, there have been 46 suspected cases, of which 15 have since been confirmed, according to the WHO. The first European case was confirmed on May 7 in an individual who returned to England from Nigeria. Since then, more than 100 cases have been confirmed outside Africa, according to a tracker maintained by a University of Oxford academic. Many of the cases are not linked to travel to the continent. As a result, the cause of this outbreak is unclear, although health authorities have said that there is potentially some degree of community spread. The WHO said the early cases were unusual for three reasons: In Britain, where 20 cases have been now confirmed, the UK Health Security Agency said the recent cases in the country were predominantly among men who self-identified as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men. Portugal detected nine more cases on Friday, taking its total to 23. The previous tally of 14 cases were all detected in sexual health clinics and were men aged between 20 and 40 years of age who self-identified as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men. It was too early to say if the illness has morphed into a sexually transmitted disease, said Alessio D'Amato, health commissioner of the Lazio region in Italy. Three cases have been reported so far in his country. ""The idea that there's some sort of sexual transmission in this, I think, is a little bit of a stretch,"" said Stuart Neil, professor of virology at Kings College London. Scientists are sequencing the virus from different cases to see if they are linked, the WHO said. The agency is expected to provide an update soon.

3,Monkeypox confirmed in Melbourne and Sydney,health,"  Monkeypox confirmed in Melbourne and Sydney Two cases of monkeypox have been confirmed, one in Melbourne and another in Sydney. The case in Melbourne is a man in his 30s who developed mild symptoms before returning home from London on May 16, and then sought medical attention. He remains in isolation at the Alfred Hospital with mild symptoms. Monkeypox is a viral infection which does not spread easily between people and tends to be mild in presentation. Dozens of cases have been either confirmed or are under investigation across the US, Canada, Europe and the UK in recent weeks. It has raised alarm because the disease is usually only found in west and central Africa, and rarely spreads elsewhere. A handful of monkeypox cases have been reported across Europe over the past few weeks, but what is this virus? Meanwhile NSW health authorities have confirmed the virus has been identified in a man who recently returned to Sydney from Europe. The man, in his 40s, went to his GP with mild symptoms several days after landing in NSW. It was determined his symptoms were clinically compatible with monkeypox and urgent testing was carried out. It's the first case to be confirmed in the state. Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said the virus was not a cause for panic given its low level of transmissibility between humans. ""Usually, you need to have quite prolonged face-to-face contact,"" Dr Chant said. ""It is not the same spread mechanism as COVID or the flu, where it [transmission] is more fleeting."" However, Dr Chant said, people should still remain vigilant about potential symptoms of the virus. ""It starts off with fever, muscle aches and pains. You can get those in large lymph nodes, headaches, feeling tired and lethargic,"" she explained. ""And then it can be followed by a rash one to three days longer. Often the rash starts on the face."" The man and a close contact are now isolating at home with care and support being provided by NSW Health and his GP. People who were on the same flights back to Australia as the man who has tested positive in Melbourne are being contacted by Victorian health authorities, and are being asked to isolate only if they develop symptoms. The affected flights are: Victoria's Department of Health has begun contact tracing, and some of the man's close contacts will be offered a vaccine, which can be effective up to four days after potential exposure. The state's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton also urged people who were on those flights to watch for symptoms. ""Those symptoms are flu-like symptoms, they can be headache, fever, muscle aches and pains,"" he said. ""Generally people are more unwell than with a mild cold so it can be quite significant constitutional symptoms. ""Then a rash occurs with those typical chicken pox-like lesions that occur — so fluid-filled, pus-filled."" Professor Sutton said there were early indications the ""few dozen cases"" across Europe and North America were a version of the disease from west Africa that is milder than other forms. But he said that version of monkeypox still had a fatality rate of between 1 and 5 per cent. ""The transmission of the virus can be through the fluids, the material within lesions in those pox,"" he said. ""There can also be respiratory transmission for people who are in close contact with each another... or close skin-to-skin contact."" Professor Sutton said the risk of transmission was ""not great"" and described the monkeypox virus as ""rare"". NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said an alert had been issued to GPs, hospitals and sexual health services across the state to be aware of cases being identified overseas. ""Cases are occasionally reported in non-endemic countries in returning travellers or their close contacts, or in owners of imported pets,"" Dr Chant said. ""People can contract monkeypox through very close contact with people who are infected with the virus. ""The infection is usually a mild illness and most people recover within a few weeks."" Health experts have added that it's highly unusual for monkeypox to be detected across multiple continents, given the virus does not easily spread from person to person. University of New South Wales Global Biosecurity Professor Raina MacIntyre, said there's seemingly no known link between the cases. ""At this stage, it looks like there's not a clear relationship from one case to the next and so people are trying to speculate as to why this is and has there been a whole lot of transmission that hasn't been noticed which would be you know asymptomatic transmission."" Monkeypox was first found in monkeys in 1958, but rats are now considered the main carrier.

4,"Jessica took a $30,000 pay cut and moved across the country to manage her debilitating eczema",health,"  Eczema's hidden toll leaves patients in excruciating pain and thousands of dollars out of pocket Jessica Elwell was in her late teens when the skin condition eczema began to wreak havoc on her life. ""I ended up being hospitalised for a week and having to have wet dressings, steroids, and moisturiser applied three times a day by the nurses which got my skin under control,"" she said. Her second serious flare-up came several years later when she was working long overnight shifts as an emergency dispatcher for the Tasmania Fire Service. ""That's when my eczema just took off and just spread all over my body, including onto my face,"" Ms Elwell said. ""That was really upsetting, because normally I could hide it everywhere else, but I couldn't hide it on my face."" For the next 18 months, Ms Elwell ""tried everything"" to bring the condition under control, including steroids, creams and UV treatments. ""When I was really, really bad, [my husband] would have to wash my hair over the bath, covering me in creams, wet wrapping me,"" she said. The couple made the last-resort decision to relocate from Hobart to Townsville in North Queensland, where the humid climate would provide some relief to Ms Elwell's skin. ""It was heartbreaking to have to give up not only the job, but both of our families [in Tasmania],"" she said. ""It meant a $30,000 pay cut for me, which was really hard."" Within four months, she said the eczema ""had almost completely gone"". Eczema, which is characterised by dry, itchy, scaly patches of skin, affects 20-30 per cent of children and about one in 10 adults. Deshan Sebaratnam, a fellow of the Australasian College of Dermatologists, said most patients suffered mild to moderate symptoms, but a minority experienced severe eczema head-to-toe. ""Because eczema is so common it's often considered a trivial condition … but eczema can be deadly because you're at increased risk of other infections,"" Dr Sebaratnam said. While most eczema medications are listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the Eczema Association of Australasia (EAA) said many people fork out significant amounts of money on extra skin care measures and specialist visits. ""It can be up to $7,000 a year just for your over-the-counter and prescribed products,"" EAA president Cheryl Talent said. ""People with eczema, they may need to use a specialised topical cream three, four, five, six times a day. So you can imagine the amount that you're going through."" The advocacy group is fighting to raise awareness about the real cost of eczema and is calling for more support for sufferers and their carers through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). ""At present, there is no space for us on the NDIS because it's not even really regarded as a disability,"" Ms Talent said. ""We'd like to have a look at NDIS funding and see if there's some wiggle room there … just to help these people with eczema manage the costs a bit better."" Ms Talent said patients could be left waiting almost a year to see a specialist. ""Waiting lists to see a public dermatologist are absolutely beyond a joke,"" she said. ""One of the problems is we don't have enough dermatologists in Australia, and we have one of the highest incidences of eczema in the whole world."" Dr Sebaratnam said the dermatologist shortage was an international problem. ""We need more hospitals to employ dermatology training positions so we can get more medical specialists out there, and also upskill GPs,"" he said. ""There are lots of myths about skin – it's one of the things taught quite poorly internationally in medical schools – and with [eczema] affecting one in five Australian kids I think increased education would also be a helpful intervention."" After two years in Townsville, Ms Elwell returned to Hobart to be closer to family. Her eczema returned following the birth of her son. ""Pretty much as soon as he was born it just again slowly started to spread, so I was completely covered again,"" she said. Her son also has mild eczema, and she hopes he never has to experience how debilitating the condition can be. ""I've had people say to me, including family, that 'it's just a rash', not realising how it affected me not only physically but mentally,"" she said. ""You can't sleep, it's excruciating to shower, you're constantly itchy, it's sore to move, you're constantly fighting infections."" Ms Elwell has just embarked on a new course of treatment which is showing promising signs but costs $200 a month. ""So it's really expensive, especially with the cost of living these days,"" she said.

5,WHO says no indication monkeypox has mutated,health,"  No evidence to suggest monkeypox virus has mutated, according to WHO The World Health Organization does not have evidence that the monkeypox virus has mutated, a senior executive at the UN agency said, noting the infectious disease that has been endemic in West and Central Africa has tended not to change. Rosamund Lewis — head of the smallpox secretariat that is part of the WHO's Emergencies Programme — told a briefing that mutations tended to be typically lower with this virus, although genome sequencing of cases will help inform understanding of the current outbreak. More than 100 suspected and confirmed cases in a recent outbreak across Europe and North America have not been severe, said the WHO's emerging diseases and zoonoses lead and technical lead on COVID-19, Maria van Kerkhove. Dr van Kerkhove said that the situation was ""containable"" particularly in Europe. ""But we can't take our eye off the ball with what's happening in Africa, in countries where it's endemic,"" Dr van Kerkhove said. According to the WHO, the outbreaks have been atypical, occurring in countries where the virus does not regularly circulate. Scientists are seeking to understand the origin of the cases and whether anything about the virus has changed. The WHO is asking dermatology and primary healthcare clinics, as well as sexual health clinics, to be alert to potential cases. Many — but not all — of the people who have been diagnosed in the current monkeypox outbreak have been men who have sex with men (MSM). Officials said it was too early to say why, but this demographic may be likely to seek medical advice or have access to sexual health screening. The virus does not usually spread easily between people, but it can be passed through close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox, such as clothing, bedding or utensils. ""We know that MSM, if they do spot an unusual rash, they're likely to want to get it sorted out quite quickly,"" said strategies advisor at the WHO's department of global HIV, hepatitis and STI, Andy Seale. ""The fact they've been proactive in responding to unusual symptoms might be part of the story. This will become clearer in the weeks and days to come."" Dr van Kerkhove said she expected more cases to be identified as surveillance expands. Asked whether the early findings may fuel discrimination, Dr Seale said: ""There are ways we can work with communities to learn from decades of experience around tackling stigma and discrimination with HIV.

7,Adelaide man wins retrial on mental health grounds after three years in custody following theft charges,health,"  Adelaide man with schizophrenia wins retrial after three years in custody following theft charges An Adelaide man has won a retrial on mental health grounds after spending more than three years in custody stemming from a 2017 incident where he threw a bottle at an elderly man and stole his backpack. In delivering his reasons for allowing the appeal and setting aside his conviction, Supreme Court Justice Mark Livesey said there was a miscarriage of justice and that overturning the man's conviction was warranted despite him already finishing his sentence. The man — who cannot be named for legal reasons — pleaded guilty in August 2018 to one count of aggravated committing theft using force and another count of theft over the incidents on December 12, 2017. Police said he threw a bottle at an 81-year-old man using a computer outside a cafe on Rundle Street, in Adelaide's CBD, about 1:20am, before punching him and stealing his backpack. He then stole a jacket from a security guard who confronted him in Rundle Mall six minutes later. After police arrested him on North Terrace, he told officers he believed the bag had belonged to his girlfriend and that the victim was a paedophile ""as a result of seeing his spirit"". When he spoke to forensic psychologist Benjamin Stewart before sentencing, the accused man said the bag had belonged to a child. He told a psychiatrist who diagnosed his schizophrenia that he was ""on a mission from God to get Adelaide running the way it is supposed to and that his family had been landlords of Adelaide for the last 700 years"", according to the judgement published last week. He also said he owned and ran international businesses, including one that had diamond mines located beneath North Terrace and the Yatala Labour Prison. He denied having any mental disorder and had used methamphetamine, cannabis, Valium, heroin, ecstasy and LSD prior to the offending. In his report, Dr Stewart said it was possible that the man harboured a delusional belief but that ""it was more likely that this was a fabricated justification given to minimise his offending"", Justice Livesey summarised in his reasons. The appellant, who has a long criminal history, was sentenced to at least two years in jail in November 2018. He was later convicted of another crime while in jail, adding four months to his sentence. Before he was meant to be released, former attorney-general Vickie Chapman applied for an extended supervision order on the man as a high-risk offender in February 2021. The order allows conditions similar to being on parole to be imposed on a former prisoner, even after his or her sentence has ended. A psychiatric report was ordered, which found he ""appears to have little understanding of his legal status"". ""He is unable to engage in logical conversation and I believe he is mentally unfit to instruct counsel and will be unable to follow the course of evidence or proceedings,"" psychiatrist Dr Paul Furst wrote in his report. Justice Livesey summarised that ""Dr Furst expressed the opinion that the appellant was not fit to instruct counsel, not fit to stand trial and, at the time of his offending, was mentally incompetent"". ""In the opinion of Dr Furst, the appellant’s offending 'was most likely to have been driven by his florid and chronic psychosis that was at that time untreated',"" Justice Livesey wrote, adding that ""he did not believe that the appellant could 'truly give rational instructions'”. Dr Furst's report also said the man believed he lived in a house with an underground Lamborghini shop that had tunnels from it that were full of paedophiles. Justice Livesey wrote that it was ""open to contend that the appellant could not in law appreciate the nature of the charge and could not be taken to intend to admit his guilt"".

""On the evidence, there are questions about his mental competence and capacity to instruct and his fitness to plead at the time of the pleas, as well as about his mental competence at the time of the alleged offending,"" he wrote. ""…Whilst it might be suggested that there is no need to address these issues where the appellant has already served his sentence, the history of this matter demonstrates that the existence of convictions for serious offending can have an important impact on a defendant long after, and regardless of, the time spent in custody. There is obvious utility in an appeal. ""The further evidence supports the conclusion, and the Director [of Public Prosecution]’s concession, that there has been a miscarriage of justice."" A spokeswoman for the DPP said it would be pursuing a new trial over whether the man was mentally competent to stand in a retrial. He was released from custody in December but has been detained under the Mental Health Act until September this year.

8,'We need to do a pre-emptive strike': Queenslanders offered free flu jabs as case numbers soar,health,"  Queenslanders offered free flu jabs as soaring case numbers project 'frightening' flu season ahead Queenslanders are being offered a free flu vaccine in a bid to protect against Influenza A as case numbers surge across the state. People aged six months and older will be able to get a free flu vaccine from now until mid-June from their local GPs and pharmacies. It comes amid a major outbreak that has seen more than 4,000 flu cases already reported this year. Queensland Health warns cases have been doubling every week — increasing from 1,848 cases to 4,282 in the latest data released last week. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she had taken the ""unprecedented"" decision to protect people amid low rates of immunity. ""Case numbers are climbing earlier than expected,"" she said. ""We are seeing the impacts on our hospitals and if we don't get a vaccinated community with the flu vaccine, we are going to see escalating numbers in our hospitals. ""So we need to do a pre-emptive strike now — we need to make sure we have this preventative measure in place."" Ms Palaszczuk said 151 people had been hospitalised with the flu so far, while 10 were in intensive care. ""The flu season this year is significantly bad and it's comparable to the season we had in 2017,"" she said. Ms Palaszczuk said young people aged between 10 and 30 were particularly at risk and warned symptoms would be similar to COVID-19. She said cost-of-living pressures were another reason she sought to make the vaccine accessible to all. Of the two most common flu types in Australia, Influenza A is considered to cause far more severe symptoms than Influenza B. Acting Queensland Chief Health Officer Peter Aitken said cases of Influenza A will lead to more hospitalisations. He urged parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as possible as the virus commonly affects young people and older Australians. ""Vaccination rates for children six months to less than five years of age is just 6 per cent,"" Dr Aitken said. Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said Influenza A had not circulated in Queensland in the past five years. Ms D'Ath said the 2017 flu season saw more than 750 people in intensive care. ""Our 2019 season saw about 300 people,"" she said. ""The fact that more than 4,000 cases have already been detected when flu seasons don't usually begin until late July is very concerning,"" she said. ""Ninety-eight per cent of our flu cases this year are Influenza A. ""Compared to the 2017 flu season's hospital admission rates, we are already at the admission rate that we saw at the end of July in 2017, which means this is escalating very quickly."" Ms D'Ath said in the next two to three weeks, cases were expected to at least double. ""So we could end up with hospitalisation well over 400 or 500 hospital admissions and that won't be the peak,"" she said. The prediction comes after flu cases had been reduced to almost nil over the past two years following the implementation of COVID-19 lockdown and social distancing measures. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. She said businesses should brace for staffing shortages over the winter months and  encourage all staff members to get the free vaccine. Both the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the Australian Medical Association (AMA) of Queensland have welcomed the move. AMA Queensland's Dr Bav Manoharan described the current flu cases as ""astonishing"". ""We're really worried about the trajectory that this flu season is heading on … it's quite frightening,"" he said.

9,"There's a surprise contender for the sixth Senate seat in Queensland, and they've got high hopes",health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Much has been made of the throng of Greens elected in lower house Queensland seats after the weekend's federal election, but could another voting trend play into the state's new ""Greensland"" nickname? With 34 per cent of the vote counted, Legalise Cannabis Australia has so far garnered 74,972 Senate votes, a swing of nearly 5 per cent from their 2019 results. Their candidate Bernard Bradley is within striking distance of the sixth Senate seat, ahead of high-profile minor party candidates Clive Palmer and Campbell Newman. As the count stands, Pauline Hanson will keep her seat in the upper house, but the UAP's chances are floundering and Mr Newman's Liberal Democrats are behind Legalise Cannabis. Whether they catch Senator Hanson and One Nation or not, the party has likely ensured they will receive AEC funding for exceeding 4 per cent of the Senate count in Queensland. Party president Michael Balderstone has been involved with the party since its origins in the northern New South Wales town of Nimbin in the early 1990s. Back then, the party was known as Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) Party. Mr Balderstone said the decision to change the name prior to the 2022 race helped the party cut through, but getting people to publicly campaign remains a hurdle. ""Not many people want to wave their arm around and say, 'Yeah! Yeah! I smoke weed!' whereas, you know, old hippies like me from Nimbin, it's expected of us,"" he said. ""Generally, most of our candidates were genuine medical cannabis users and people on the ground who are campaigning have got a strong passion."" Pain relief and the cost of medicinal cannabis are a pillar of the Legalise Cannabis 2022 campaign. ""They mocked us for a long time, you know, for saying cannabis is a medicine – we were ridiculed,"" Mr Balderstone said. ""Now it's accepted and anyone in Australia can get legal medical cannabis through their doctor, but it's pretty much grown in Canada or grown indoors. ""We could all be growing our own medicine."" Raylene Herd is one of the 75,000 who voted for the single-issue party in Queensland. Ms Herd has terminal cancer and uses medicinal cannabis to ease the pain, but it is not cheap. She receives around $1,860 a month in disability pension, but between $1,000 and $1,300 of that goes to her cannabis prescription. ""It doesn't leave you a lot of money to live with,"" she said. ""I lost everything. I couldn't pay my mortgage, I lost my house, I was homeless for a while and now I'm living with my 89-year-old father."" She said the cost of her pain medication pushes her budget to the extremes. ""After I get my medication, I'd be lucky to have $200, $300 a fortnight and that is for everything — that is to try and keep the car registered and petrol, that is trying to put a roof over my head, get food, everything,"" she said. ""I will barely eat, that's basically what it comes down to. I buy fresh food when I can, mainly fruit. ""Sometimes I buy ice cream and stuff to make smoothies to try and bulk myself up, but I'm losing weight horrendously. Because of cancer and because I just can't afford to nourish myself."" She said without the medicinal cannabis she is ""curled up in a ball in pain"", and the pharmaceutical options are simply not viable, wearing off too quickly and inducing a ""spiralling circle of pain and pharmaceuticals and vomiting"". ""Unless you have experienced the difference, you wouldn't understand it,"" she said. Queensland is where Legalise Cannabis Australia has had its strongest showing outside of the Northern Territory, where its 2,664 votes translate to 7 per cent of the vote. Mr Balderstone said the national campaign was run on a shoestring budget after the party spent more than $30,000 entering candidates in every state and territory, but lead Queensland Senate candidate Mr Bradley contributed money to the campaign in the Sunshine State. ""Queensland did have more money and energy for the campaign, maybe that made a difference,"" Mr Balderstone said. He also noted there have been nearly 130,000 applications for medicinal cannabis in Queensland, more than double any other state. ""Medical cannabis, I think, got more of an open green light in Queensland early on in the licensing of it. That's possibly helped too — to a lot of people from Queensland on medical cannabis,"" Mr Balderstone said. ""[There's] a lot of retirees in Queensland, and cannabis is fantastic for chronic pain or crook backs or if you can't sleep. ""A lot of people have discovered it legally. That'd be part of it, too."" Or perhaps, he said, it was just the general laid-back nature of the state's constituents. ""I think Queensland is just more relaxed, probably,"" he said. Adjunct professor of politics at Griffith University Anne Tiernan said she thinks the higher vote for Legalise Cannabis is more likely a reflection of a disgruntled electorate. What do you want to know about the upcoming election? How will it impact you? Do you have a story you want to share? Tell us more. Even so, she was surprised by their success, especially compared to the UAP. ""Isn't it extraordinary that the [United Australia Party] got so little a return on its investment of just vast amounts of spending and advertising and the Legalise Cannabis party has done so well,"" she said. ""It really begs the question about whether they then want to build a platform and a network – those small parties have often really struggled to do that, so it's probably a better result than they were expecting, but [it's] just indicative of how the major party vote splintered and fragmented across the state and across the nation."" Dr Tiernan said it was ""a bit of a stretch"" to assume this result was the beginning of a political wave for the party, but said it was important for any party to reach that magical 4 per cent. ""It means that they've got a financial platform to build on in a way that they didn't before,"" she said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Mr Balderstone said the party's main goals were now education and getting rid of the stigma. ""Our job really is to re-educate people on the truth, and that's getting out there,"" he said. ""The statistics are coming out of America ... people don't get criminal records they've got to carry all their life. ""It's changed and people realise it isn't the spooky thing it was — we've been lied to. ""The word is out there that you can change this law and legalise weed and the sky doesn't fall in.""

10,'She wastes cassava': Navigating infertility in the Pacific ,health,"  Lice Movono's fertility issues set 'tongues wagging' — so just how difficult is it for Pacific Island women who want to have children? Pacific Islanders are renowned for having big, tight-knit families, but this notion can create problems for women who struggle with fertility. Little is known about the extent of infertility in the Pacific Islands due to under-reporting and a lack of research. However, one paper in 2018 explored Pacific Islander women's infertility experiences in New Zealand. It found this marginalised group was often stereotyped as being ""hyper-fertile"", compounding the stigma attached to the issue of infertility. Gender, culture and religion also helped reinforce this notion, making matters worse for Pacific Islander women. Hilda Wayne finds out what it is like to struggle with infertility in cultures that value big families. In her early 20s, a routine check-up led Fijian journalist Lice Movono down a path of surgeries and medication in order to have children. It was a large, painful cyst on her ovary that prompted the treatment and fast-tracked thoughts about having a family of her own — her then-partner already had children that she had ""taken to very quickly, very naturally"". However, as she approached her late 20s, Ms Movono said ""tongues started wagging"" and nasty remarks from family — both immediate and extended — intensified. ""In Fiji, there's a derogatory joke that goes around when a woman can't have children – they say, 'She wastes cassava', meaning food is wasted on her because she's not going to give you children,"" she said. ""It was, at that time, a source of a lot of tension or friction between my partner and I and, eventually, my in-laws. Ms Movono used a ""little window"" of time to try to to conceive. ""At the time, I just couldn't fathom the idea that, if I left it too late, I wouldn't be able to have kids,"" she said. Amid the full-time reporting, study and ongoing pain associated with her surgeries, Ms Movono fell pregnant. Nine months later Esther was born. She was, admittedly, a ""huge baby"" who made for a challenging and traumatic delivery. ""I had her at about 39 weeks, and she was 4.6 kilograms because, of course, that's what I needed, to have a humungous baby to deal with,"" she joked. Despite the arduous journey to become a mother, Ms Movono said Esther was ""just the prettiest thing, the easiest baby"". Not long after, Ms Movono fell pregnant again with Esther's brother, Jacob. ""It was a pretty difficult journey,"" she said. ""I know a lot of women who will not talk about these issues because they're of a reproductive health nature and it has a taboo element attached to it,"" she said. Dr Edith Kariko is a Senior Health Specialist with the World Bank in Port Moresby. She said infertility stigma also affected women in Papua New Guinea because sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were a leading cause of fertility issues, and few women want to discuss it. Having control over your sexual and reproductive health is a human right, but research shows two-thirds of Pacific Island women who want to avoid or delay pregnancy are unable to do so. ""If you're a woman of reproductive age, you can't speak up about vaginal discharge or pains in the lower abdomen, pain with urination,"" she said. ""They wait until the last minute and that results in untreated STIs that have already caused complications [to a woman's fertility]."" Dr Kariko said sexual and reproductive health education in schools was inadequate and needed to be revised to create a ""culturally enabling environment"" for such conversations to take place. ""Having the awareness on where they can get help, or what is causing particular infertility, even for young people to discuss this openly before they get into relationships is really critical,"" she said. Dr Leeanne Panisi is the only female fertility specialist among a cohort of four in Solomon Islands and works at Honiara's National Referral Hospital. She said cultural practices such as 'bride price' were being abused in some cases to add pressure on women to conceive. ""There are certain communities where women are expected to get pregnant and have children because ... 'bride price' was paid and the families of the husband or the partner expect her to have children,"" she said. For the women who had exhausted all fertility options, Dr Panisi said, adoption within families was the next best thing. ""Usually the adoption is from a close relative or family member, but it can be also from somebody from a different culture or a distant relative,"" she said. Lealaiauloto Lia'i Si'itia is the director of the Samoa Family Health Association. In Samoa today, Lealaiauloto said women who could not afford to see specialists often sought help from traditional practitioners, despite their procedures being known to ""aggravate"" fertility issues. ""They come very late to family fertility centres because they first seek help from traditional practitioners, caregivers, nurses and sometimes churches,"" she said. ""[The view] is that [women] are not blessed with a child so they need to seek some spiritual blessings, advice and traditional healing.""

11,'Putting the sex into sexagenarian': Kathy Lette on a woman’s life in two acts,health,"  Comedian Kathy Lette talks writing, ageing and why she's putting the 'sex' into sexagenarian Kathy Lette is having the time of her life: At 63, with a boyfriend seven years her junior, an A-list-heavy social calendar and a new novel on the shelves, she's become the poster-woman for post-menopausal fulfilment. ""I think for women, life is in two acts,"" says the successful ex-pat writer. ""The trick is surviving the interval. The menopause is the interval. The menopause is awful but, once you get through that, it's the best time of a woman's life. No one talks about this."" While happy to correct this omission, she does so broadly, shying away from introspection or significant disclosure. For someone who has made a career out of lightly fictionalising every stage of her life, from puberty to menopause, Kathy Lette is surprisingly uncomfortable talking about herself. ""I came here today as if going to my execution,"" she says during her interview for Australian Story. ""I'd rather you read my books and glimpse me through the narrative than actually lay myself out bare."" Kathy is adept at deflecting unwanted scrutiny, cloaking personal disclosure in generalities and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of puns and well-worn one-liners. It is this tendency that has led some to underestimate her; to see her as frivolous and maybe a little superficial. But pry a little and a more complicated version of Kathy Lette eventually emerges from behind the ""court jester and party animal"" persona she so enthusiastically cultivates. Kathy's career started early and with a bang. At 16 she left school and moved out of home, much to the horror of her school principal mother. And at 17, she co-wrote the seminal coming-of-age novel Puberty Blues with her best friend, Gabrielle Carey. Based on her and Carey's efforts in their early teens to fit in to the surf culture at Sydney's Cronulla Beach, it was a raw examination of the brutally sexist rites of passage girls then endured and it has gone on to become a feminist classic. Anticipating a hostile reaction to the book, Kathy tried to warn her mother, Val Lette. ""She said to me, 'Mum, I'm having a book published and it could be controversial, would you like me to use a nom de plume?',"" Val recalls. ""I looked at her and thought the girl's deluded; girls of 17 don't get books published. So I said, 'No, put it under your own name,' thinking it would never see the light of day. And then when it did, there was controversy."" That's something of an understatement. When the book was eventually published in 1979, it caused shock waves around the country. Val recalls anonymous phone calls at night accusing her of being unable to control her daughter. ""It was pretty horrific, and my father was traumatised too,"" Kathy says. ""So I didn't go home for quite a while; maybe a year."" Bruce Beresford's movie adaptation of Puberty Blues followed in 1981, ensuring even more outrage and attention. It was a lot for two young women to handle and their friendship didn't survive. ""It was a very intense time and there was suddenly a lot of pressure on us,"" Kathy explains. ""The fun evaporated and the serious side of life overwhelmed us. We just grew apart, and I haven't seen Gabs once since then, which is quite extraordinary that our paths haven't crossed."" Now writing alone, Kathy struggled both to follow up Puberty Blues and outgrow its legacy. In the eyes of the media, she remained the voice of youth, handy for a cheeky quote or pithy one-liner, and she was happy to oblige. In her early 20s she married future News Limited CEO Kim Williams, who was then involved in various arts institutions and was six years her senior. ""Kathy was completely enraptured with being a writer and she went about it with the most single-minded conviction,"" Williams recalls. She wrote plays, short stories, articles for magazines and newspapers and spent a year in the US writing for sitcoms. But as her 30th birthday approached, she had yet to live up to the early promise of Puberty Blues. Then, in 1988, fate intervened. Kathy was called in as a last-minute replacement for Kylie Minogue on the panel for one of Geoffrey Robertson's Hypotheticals, an occasional program in which the London-based Australian human rights lawyer examined an issue of the day by asking guests to respond to hypothetical scenarios. ""I got a telegram saying Kylie can't make it; you'll have to make do with Kathy Lette. Little did I think I'd be making do with her for the next 25 years,"" quips Robertson. ""It was just that bolt of lightning where we just couldn't stop talking,"" Kathy says. ""I just had to be with that person, and he felt the same way."" They immediately embarked upon an affair, despite Lette being married and Robertson being in a relationship back in London with Nigella Lawson, then best known as the daughter of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Margaret Thatcher's government. ""What is it about love?"" Robertson says. ""It makes you put aside all rationality and leap into it."" Unsure how to break the news to her husband, Kathy decided to wait until her 30th birthday had passed. But when Williams threw a surprise party for her, things came to a head. ""When we got home, Kathy was very distressed,"" Williams recalls. ""And you have that light-bulb moment when suddenly you realise something and I said, 'Who is it?' And all was revealed — that she and Geoffrey had been conducting a relationship for some time and she was going to relocate to the UK."" ""My guilt gland still throbs,"" Kathy says, ""but I just, I couldn't help running away with Geoff. It just was too big, and Geoff felt the same."" ""I was devastated,"" Williams admits. ""Kathy is not someone who indulges in a lot of sadness or negative personal reflection, and that's a good thing. She's a very positive spirit. ""I imagine she has spent very little time ever reflecting on our life together because that was then, now is now. You know, you move on."" In a new country with a new husband, Kathy found the space to re-invent herself and get her writing career back on track. Initially, she had to navigate a sceptical British media that couldn't understand why Robertson would leave Nigella Lawson for this seemingly gauche Australian. One prominent headline, ""The motormouth who got goddess Nigella's man"", summed up the mood. But she quickly learned that attack was the best mode of defence, gently mocking the British establishment in such best-selling novels as Foetal Attraction and Mad Cows. Robertson believes leaving Australia for London was vital for her success. ""She was locked into a very enjoyable but nonetheless a very small pond in which she was a major frog,"" he says. ""But in going to Britain, in dealing with the criticism that she faced, in facing it down and succeeding, that taught her a lot of lessons and I think deepened and broadened her perspective as a writer."" What also deepened and broadened her perspective was motherhood, and specifically raising a son on the autism spectrum. For many years, Kathy didn't speak publicly about the fact that her son Jules, now 31, has Aspergers. But when she came to do publicity for her 2012 novel The Boy Who Fell to Earth, about a woman raising an autistic child, she sought Jules's permission to talk openly about his condition. ""I was quite relaxed about the whole thing,"" says Jules, a delightful young man with a mischievous sense of humour and an entertainingly unfiltered manner. ""A lot of people believe that everyone with autism acts the same or has the same form of autism, when everyone's autism is different. I thought it was important for people to know more about it, so I think it was really good that she wrote that book. ""It's probably my favourite book she's written,"" he adds, ""even though I haven't read any."" ""I should have talked about it much earlier,"" Kathy says, ""because it's always better to shine a light into a dark corner. Always. And, of course, everybody is dealing with something."" As is often the case with autism, the condition was not apparent when Jules was a baby. ""He talked early, he walked early — Geoff and I kept looking at each other thinking we had this little genius on our hands,"" Kathy recalls. ""And then at about 13 months, it was as though his computer crashed. He lost his language. He retreated into himself."" It took several years before Kathy was able to get a diagnosis of autism and many difficult years after that as she tried to find him the help he needed. ""It was a very expensive, long, drawn-out, incredibly anxious time of my life,"" Kathy admits. ""One day when he was nine, he came home with a sign sticky taped to his back saying, 'Kick me, I'm a retard,'"" she recalls. ""He's saying to me, 'The kids are calling me a retard. What is a retard, mummy? Am I a retard?' You might as well just rip your heart out of your chest and stomp on it but how do you protect them all the time? You can't."" Like many people with Aspergers, Jules has particular obsessions and a savant-like ability to recall details about them. His are acting and tennis and he can recite the entire filmography of favourite actors and the scores of matches in countless tennis tournaments going back decades. But few could have imagined how far he would take his interest in acting. ""When people ask me what advice I could give them for their autistic child,"" Kathy says, ""I would just say indulge their obsessions because you never know where it will take them."" Kathy enrolled Jules in acting classes from an early age even though she didn't believe acting was a viable profession for him. But he surprised everyone with his aptitude and determination and for the past six years he has had a recurring role on the long-running BBC medical drama Holby City, playing a porter with Aspergers called Jason. That show was recently axed after 23 seasons, but last month Jules won Best Actor at the Rome Outcast Independent Film Awards for his role in the short film Love, and he recently filmed an episode for the British crime drama Midsomer Murders. ""Being an actor is very exciting,"" Jules says. ""It's very interesting playing someone who isn't you. It wasn't easy, but I always thought I was quite a convincing actor."" ""He gets more recognition than either of us,"" Geoffrey Robertson says with a proud chuckle. ""We walk down the street, people ran up to him and see him as Jason from Holby."" As Robertson became increasingly absorbed in his successful career as an international human rights lawyer, the heavy lifting of raising Jules and his younger sister Georgie fell to Kathy. She cut back on her TV work and movie adaptations of her books and focused on writing, as this was something she could fit around helping Jules. Typically, she makes light of this in her public performances, joking about how hard it is to take the moral high ground when your partner is saving people on death row. But it did put strain on the marriage. ""Geoff will be the first one to say that he's a workaholic and he worked really full-on right through our marriage,"" Kathy says. ""So the burden did fall on me. And it just got a bit too exhausting."" ""Looking back, I'm sorry that I didn't spend more time with family at particular times because I had other calls on my time,"" Robertson says. ""But it's something that you realise afterwards."" In 2017, after 27 years of marriage, the couple divorced. While acknowledging that it was not easy for either of them, Kathy emerged with a renewed sense of purpose and a conviction that women her age need to embrace what she calls their ""second act"". ""Once you're through the menopause, your oestrogen levels drop, which is your caring, sharing hormone, and your testosterone comes up. So for the first time ever, you get a little bit more bolshie, a little bit more selfish – a little bit more like a bloke, actually – and you put yourself first. ""I would say to women: 'You've put yourself second your whole life; this is the time for you. So carpe the hell out of diem.'"" And she's leading by example. She's fanatical about her fitness and leads a social life that would exhaust someone half her age. And she has a younger partner, Irish guitarist and composer Brian O'Doherty, who she swapped phone numbers with after hearing him practising a piece by Bach under a tree. ""I didn't ring,"" he says sheepishly. ""I literally knew nothing about Kathy."" Kathy was not so reticent and before long they were a couple. ""How many men would take on a middle-aged woman with a grown-up autistic son?"" Kathy says. ""He's very generous and kind in that way. So it was a lovely thing that happened to me in my second act."" As Kathy likes to say, she's ""putting the sex into sexagenarian"" and her message of post-menopausal empowerment is one that resonates with her predominantly female audience. But her new-found sense of freedom is tempered by reality. While Kathy is justifiably proud of what her son has achieved, she is fiercely protective of him and knows that her work is not done. ""While I'm saying 'carpe the hell out of diem, have fun', I will never actually be able to cut the psychological umbilical cord that keeps me tethered to Jules, because he needs me,"" she says. ""The big worry, too, when you have a child with special needs is what are they going to do when you're no longer around, so not too much of the burden falls on your other children? My big aim now is to just get Jules completely independent. Self-sufficient with support."" When Kathy talks about the challenges of raising Jules or her fears for his future, you can sense her discomfort as she strains against her naturally upbeat disposition. While she can be serious and has strong opinions about politics and feminism, she seems genuinely predisposed to look on the bright side of life. ""She's just born with this innate positivity,"" O'Doherty says. ""In my entire life, I have never witnessed anything like it."" Her natural inclination is to try to lighten the mood with a quip or a pun, to strike a pose and flash that mega-watt grin. And if that's led some to underestimate her, you sense that's a price she's willing to pay. ""It's much harder to make people laugh than it is to make them cry,"" she says. ""So I think if you can entertain and enlighten and uplift then that's the ultimate literary trick. ""When women write to me and say that I got them through a particularly dark period of their life, that to me is better than winning the Pulitzer Prize.""

12,Some of us are more vulnerable to mould allergies than others. Here's what symptoms to look out for,health," Health What are the health effects of mould, and how do you get rid of it? After months of heavy rainfall and increased humidity along Australia's east coast, many people are now dealing with an unwelcome and often stubborn house guest: mould. A type of fungus, mould is present almost everywhere. It lives on plant and animal matter and plays an important role in our ecosystem. But mould growth inside the home, often brought on by flood damage, plumbing leaks or damp and humid conditions, can be damaging to our health, especially when left unchecked. ""There's always mould in every house, but it needs dampness to grow, and there's a lot [of dampness] at the moment because of the floods and rain,"" said Holly Jones, a researcher in the healthy housing unit at Melbourne University's school of population and global health. ""What causes illness is certain species of mould being more concentrated … so by keeping your house dry, you're keeping that in check."" Mould can affect everything from clothing to furniture, and is often noticeable as a stain, smudge or discoloured patch. But it can also be harder to find — behind furniture, at the back of wardrobes, and even inside wall cavities, says architectural scientist Tim Law of Victoria University. ""The problem is mould is not always visible: it tends to grow in the dark, interstitial spaces of a building, so you may not be able to see it,"" said Dr Law, who researches how the microbiology of buildings can affect human health. ""You might be able to smell it, but otherwise, it's usually quite hard to detect."" In order to reproduce, mould spawns tiny particles called spores which are carried in the air. Sometimes, these can trigger allergy and respiratory symptoms such as nasal congestion, wheezing, watery or itchy eyes, coughing, and respiratory infections. Mould can also worsen asthma and allergic conditions. ""All of our organs and surfaces have barriers, and mould is something that can irritate those barriers and open up that junction,"" immunologist and allergy specialist Sheryl Van Nunen said. ""Mould can give you asthma, it can exacerbate your asthma, and it can keep your asthma going or have it become chronic."" For most people, exposure to a very small amount of mould does not have serious health consequences. But how you respond depends on your genetic makeup, underlying health, and how sensitive you are to mould. After months of wet weather, many people are struggling to contain mould. Here's how to get rid of it. Professor Van Nunen, who is also a spokesperson for the National Asthma Council, says approximately 40 per cent of Australians are atopic, meaning they have ""an inherent ability to be allergic"". People with allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions are more vulnerable to the health effects of mould, as are infants, children and older people. ""The thing that concerns me particularly is children … asthma has been clearly established as being associated with visible mould and mould odour,"" Professor Van Nunen said. ""One of the other really important findings is that if a pregnant woman is living in a mouldy home, [her] child has an increased risk of asthma."" People with weakened immune systems — such as cancer patients undergoing treatment or organ transplant recipients — are also at risk of more serious complications, including rare but severe mould infections in the lungs. Dr Law stressed that in large quantities, mould spores can cause ill health in almost anyone. ""At some point, you can have enough mould in the building so that nobody is going to remain healthy under those conditions,"" he said. In addition to established respiratory symptoms, mould exposure has also been linked to a biotoxin-related illness known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, or CIRS. CIRS is a progressive multi-system illness characterised by exposure to biotoxins, Dr Law said. Symptoms are reported to include headaches, chronic fatigue, mood swings, allergies and night sweats. ""For a lot of people who have suffered this condition, it took them a long time to make the connection between their condition and the building [they inhabited],"" Dr Law said. ""One of the clearest indicators is if people go on holiday and live in a different environment and then suddenly feel very refreshed, and when they come back to their house or office, they feel it all over again."" But CIRS is not a widely recognised medical condition, and many doctors treat it with ""a certain amount of suspicion"", Dr Law says. What rights do renters have when it comes to mould growth and who should remove it? A 2018 parliamentary inquiry into CIRS called for more research into the potential health effects of mould, after medical experts noted a lack of evidence showing a causal relationship between ""exposure to biotoxins and unexplained complex symptoms"". Ms Jones said one of the key barriers to understanding CIRS was the difficulty researchers faced when trying to measure mould exposure. ""It's not like doing a blood test — [the amount of mould is] going to be different based on the season, who lives in the house, whether there is a cat or dog, whether someone's been for a walk in nature in the last week,"" she said. ""So that's what I'm focusing on, because once you can measure how much people are exposed … you can see whether there is causal evidence."" Dr Law is also part of a research team funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) investigating whether there are clear biomarkers associated with CIRS. ""We hope to really gain some traction with the NHMRC funding and work out a way to screen for it."" While some of the health impacts of mould exposure are still to be determined, Ms Jones says it's widely recognised that poor housing quality, including mouldy and damp living conditions, increases the risk of poor health outcomes. The World Health Organization has previously estimated that mould affects between 10 and 50 per cent of homes in Australia. Research suggests these are more likely to be in low-income communities. ""The WHO says there is no safe level of exposure to the toxins from mould,"" she said. Well-designed and well-maintained homes are critical to the prevention of mould, but Dr Law says a lack of agreed exposure standards means measures to ensure adequate ventilation and to limit condensation aren't always enforced. ""Very often, these things are not dealt with, and the occupant is the one that bears the consequences of mould and so forth,"" he said. ""Given how prevalent mould already is … we really need to look at this more carefully."" Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice. Where possible, it's important people remove any mould growth in their home, and take steps to prevent it from growing back, Ms Jones says. ""The number one thing is to keep your house dry: prevent moisture in any way you can … that could be with dehumidifiers, or with ventilation. ""And check the tenancy regulations in your state if you're a renter. ""They vary state by state, but a few states do say if it's a structural problem that causes mould, it's the landlord's responsibility to fix it."" In addition to reducing the amount of moisture, Professor Van Nunen recommended people use a vinegar solution to remove mould instead of bleach. ""In most cases, if you use bleach, a background level of mould spores will remain and you're not really getting rid of it. Whereas vinegar will do it."" It's also important to remember that in some cases, when the mould is widespread or your health is being compromised, it may be necessary to bring in professional help.

13,WHO holds emergency meeting to discuss monkeypox spread,health,"  WHO holds emergency meeting on monkeypox spread as Europe cases rise The World Health Organization (WHO) is holding an emergency meeting to discuss the recent outbreak of monkeypox, a viral infection more commonly seen in west and central Africa, after more than 100 cases have been confirmed or suspected in Europe. WARNING: Graphic images in this story may be distressing for some readers. In what Germany described as the largest outbreak in Europe ever, monkeypox cases have been reported in at least nine countries — Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom — as well as the United States, Canada and Australia. Spain reported 24 new cases on Friday, mainly in the Madrid region, where the regional government closed a sauna linked to the majority of infections. A hospital in Israel was treating a man in his 30s who is displaying symptoms consistent with the disease after recently arriving from Western Europe. First identified in monkeys, the disease typically spreads through close contact and has rarely spread outside Africa, so this series of cases has triggered concern. However, scientists do not expect the outbreak to evolve into a pandemic like COVID-19, given the virus does not spread as easily as SARS-CoV-2. Monkeypox is usually a mild viral illness, characterised by symptoms of fever as well as a distinctive bumpy rash of blisters that can burst, leaving craters. ""This is the largest and most widespread outbreak of monkeypox ever seen in Europe,"" said Germany's armed forces' medical service, which detected its first case in the country on Friday. A handful of monkeypox cases have been reported across Europe over the past few weeks, but what is this virus? The WHO committee meeting to discuss the issue is its strategic and technical advisory group on infectious hazards with pandemic and epidemic potential (STAG-IH), which advises on infection risks that could pose a global health threat. It would not be responsible for deciding whether the outbreak should be declared a public health emergency of international concern, WHO's highest form of alert, which is currently applied to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""There appears to be a low risk to the general public at this time,"" a senior US administration official said. Fabian Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute, described the outbreaks as an epidemic. ""However, it is very unlikely that this epidemic will last long. The cases can be well isolated via contact tracing and there are also drugs and effective vaccines that can be used if necessary,"" he said. Still, the WHO's European chief said he was concerned that infections could accelerate in the region as people gather for parties and festivals over the summer months. There is no specific vaccine for monkeypox, but data shows that the vaccines used to eradicate smallpox are up to 85 per cent effective against monkeypox, according to the WHO. British authorities said they have offered a smallpox vaccine to some healthcare workers and others who may have been exposed to monkeypox. Since 1970, monkeypox cases have been reported in 11 African countries. Nigeria has had a large, ongoing outbreak since 2017. So far this year, there have been 46 suspected cases, of which 15 have since been confirmed, according to the WHO. The first European case was confirmed on May 7 in an individual who returned to England from Nigeria. Since then, more than 100 cases have been confirmed outside Africa, according to a tracker maintained by a University of Oxford academic. Many of the cases are not linked to travel to the continent. As a result, the cause of this outbreak is unclear, although health authorities have said that there is potentially some degree of community spread. The WHO said the early cases were unusual for three reasons: In Britain, where 20 cases have been now confirmed, the UK Health Security Agency said the recent cases in the country were predominantly among men who self-identified as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men. Portugal detected nine more cases on Friday, taking its total to 23. The previous tally of 14 cases were all detected in sexual health clinics and were men aged between 20 and 40 years of age who self-identified as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men. It was too early to say if the illness has morphed into a sexually transmitted disease, said Alessio D'Amato, health commissioner of the Lazio region in Italy. Three cases have been reported so far in his country. ""The idea that there's some sort of sexual transmission in this, I think, is a little bit of a stretch,"" said Stuart Neil, professor of virology at Kings College London. Scientists are sequencing the virus from different cases to see if they are linked, the WHO said. The agency is expected to provide an update soon.

14,Kylie caught COVID twice in eight weeks. So will reinfections slow Western Australia's pandemic recovery?,health," Coronavirus After a relatively mild first bout of COVID-19, triple-vaccinated Perth teacher Kylie Lund was shocked to catch the virus again so quickly — and so badly — just eight weeks later. She tested positive for the second time last Friday and went downhill quickly, having to call an ambulance on Sunday night after finding it difficult to breathe and swallow. ""I have had worse hangovers than my first COVID but this [second] just floored me,"" she said. ""It's such a weird virus."" As Western Australia continued to record its highest-ever daily COVID-19 infections this week, a small but growing number of people like Ms Lund are also becoming reinfected with the virus. While the case of a healthcare worker testing positive for two different variants of COVID 20 days apart might be rare, reinfections are increasingly common. So, what are the odds of getting sick a second time? It's a scenario that has been recorded around the world but the concept of reinfection is somewhat novel in WA, where the population is still adjusting to its first wide-scale community outbreak more than two years into the pandemic. A WA Health spokesperson said they were in the early stages of tracking reinfections in WA, which it defines as an infection more than 12 weeks after a previous infection. While this is the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia definition of reinfection, it does not capture Ms Lund's experience of eight weeks between infections. ""A person can experience reinfection of COVID-19 strains, similar to how a person can be reinfected by common colds or influenza,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""Reinfection can occur twelve weeks or longer following initial infection."" The Telethon Kids Institute's Peter Richmond said that data from overseas showed that reinfections were not common, with about one in every 2,000 infections being a reinfection. ""It is relatively rare, to be honest, and is generally not associated with a particularly severe second infection,"" Professor Richmond said. But he said that because WA was experiencing such high rates of infection, the chances of being exposed to the virus were very high. ""If you think every day in WA we're now getting 17,000 [cases], then you would expect eight of those people would get reinfected in a short period of time if they're exposed to the virus,"" he said. Schools, in particular, have been particularly hurt by the COVID-19 outbreak. Ms Lund started the school year soon after receiving her booster vaccination in mid-January but caught the virus from a student in early March. She thinks her second bout of the virus came via her daughter. As a teacher, she feels bad about her absence from the classroom — this is her fourth round of COVID leave, including time off as a close contact — and its impact on her students and fellow teachers. ""When I rang my principal, I just burst into tears,"" she said Professor Richmond, who is the director of the Institute's vaccines trial group, said the Omicron variant was about 10 times as likely to be associated with reinfection compared with previous strains of the virus. Most of us know someone who has managed to dodge catching COVID-19, despite being in a household with people who are sick. What makes some of us more resistant than others? He said reinfection was more likely in unvaccinated people, while those who were both vaccinated and had a previous infection had stronger immunity. ""Vaccination alone seems to be better than infection alone in preventing a subsequent infection,"" he said. While WA has a high vaccination rate, with 80 per cent of the eligible population triple-jabbed, immunity is beginning to fade for some as this current wave of infection hits new peaks. Some older and more vulnerable community members have been receiving a fourth jab, which Professor Richmond said international research had shown could help to prevent reinfection up to two months afterwards. He is hoping to learn more through a study he is leading into the immune response to a fourth jab and whether they can predict who will be reinfected. But when asked whether we will be in a constant cycle of infection and reinfection, he said it was still difficult to tell. ""It will eventually level out but it may be, like we have with the cold virus, we don't really get rid of them. We just don't notice them so much,"" he said.

16,Merrilyn has volunteered at parkrun 400 times without ever having run the course. Here's what keeps her coming back,health," Sport When her local parkrun shut down due to COVID-19 restrictions, Merrilyn McMillan was, in her words, ""devastated"". ""I was totally lost,"" she told ABC Sport. ""It was like someone had died."" Just over a decade ago, the now 73-year-old McMillan had no inkling that the community-based activity would become such an integral part of her life. Her husband, Malcolm, a keen runner, had read about the arrival of the global phenomenon in Adelaide in the local paper. While he ran the 5km Torrens course, she would sit in the car knitting and reading the news. One Saturday morning, when no volunteers turned up, Merrilyn was ""rounded up"" to help out. Now, the once reluctant volunteer is a veteran of no less than 412 parkruns, all the more remarkable because she has never walked or run the event. So what keeps her coming back? ""You just come away feeling uplifted,"" she said. ""And you feel appreciated. The participants are constantly saying thank you, and it gives them an anchor too, like when you've gone away on holidays and come back, they say 'oh we've missed you'."" ""I mean, it's lovely to get praise,"" she added. ""But at the same time, you're not doing it for the praise. To me it's just something I do which benefits me. ""It makes you feel like you've got something to contribute — you don't feel so useless. I think it's good for your self-esteem, and your mental health is a big part of your physical health."" When parkrun first came to Adelaide, McMillan had been out of work for 10 years. She had previously worked in the office of an equipment testing company, but after a restructure that saw staff numbers reduced dramatically, McMillan found herself taking on more and more responsibilities. ""I was always one of those people who just managed to get everything done,"" she said. ""And then suddenly, I wasn't getting things done. It was all too much and physically I started to break down."" McMillan, who was surviving on — ""no joke"" — 18 cups of coffee a day, eventually fell ill with pneumonia. One consequence of the pneumonia was that she could no longer stand the smell or taste of coffee. Then the excruciating headaches began. ""My doctor sent me to the neurologist because he thought I had a brain tumour, but it was actually withdrawals from the coffee,"" she said. ""And then I collapsed in the neurologist's rooms."" What followed, according to McMillan, was a ""full mental breakdown"". The neurologist sent her straight to hospital and into the care of a dedicated mental health team. With the help of an ""extremely good psychiatrist"", among others, McMillan slowly began to recover, but she never returned to work. ""The first 10 years after [finishing work], I didn't make a lot of progress, because I sort of isolated myself, went into myself,"" she said. ""So it took a bit to get back out there. ""I don't think that I fully started feeling good about myself until I started doing parkrun. ""They say that exercise is good for your mental health, but being a parkrun volunteer is as good as it gets. It's the best possible medication — you can't bottle it."" This national volunteer week, parkrun is celebrating some remarkable milestones. Globally, just under 60,000 people like McMillan have never run or walked the event, but between them have volunteered half a million times. In Australia, over the 11 years since the event first arrived, a total of 126,542 people have volunteered. And, since pandemic restrictions eased, parkrun has maintained its pre-COVID number of volunteers, including recruiting 11,933 people to the event for the first time. Carol Cunningham, head of volunteering management at parkrun, said this was in part due to how ""easy and accessible"" signing up is. ""You could literally walk to your car, come along tomorrow and say 'I want to volunteer', and we'd say 'no dramas, come and help over here',"" Cunningham said. ""You don't need any skills, or qualifications. We don't turn anyone away."" Cunningham said parkrun also had the advantage of being an outdoor activity, which allowed for social distancing and ""easing into"" physical activity. ""There's still some anxiety in the community around COVID… and many people have come out of two years of the pandemic where they've been inactive. They haven't been around people, and volunteering offers them an opportunity to be out in the fresh air and do a bit of movement,"" she said. ""It helps people get back to where they were before COVID, reassures them, builds their confidence back up and gives them an alternative pathway to be out in their community."" Connection to community is what gets Robyn Lindsay out of bed every Saturday morning to volunteer at the 7am Mosman parkrun in Sydney. Since 2015, the 66-year-old has volunteered a total of 255 times. ""I'm not a runner, I'm more of a plodder,"" says Lindsay. ""I have done some runs, but I wasn't happy with my 30-minute-plus times. That's pure vanity. ""So I fell into volunteering, and it has become a bit of an addiction."" Each Saturday, Lindsay stations herself in the same spot: a hill near the Mosman spit bridge that has affectionately become known — by fellow parkrunners — as ""Robyn's Hill"". Part of the appeal of being stationed on the hill, she says, is that the Mosman course sees participants walk or run the hill three times. ""I'm probably a bit of a sticky beak, so I like to know what's going on,"" says Lindsay. Steve Connelly experienced debilitating depression and anxiety after his battle with heart disease, but a visit to his GP — and a left-field script — changed his life. ""I get to be up there by myself, taking in all the beautiful scenery, but also chatting with the runners and cyclists passing through, and people walking their dogs. ""There's people from all different walks of life that I would never have met had I not gone to parkrun."" As an example, she cites meeting the chairlift operator at Taronga Park Zoo, and a young woman who is a chef by training, works for Google and dreams of being stationed as a scientist in Antarctica. What they have in common, she says, is how happy they are to be at parkrun — and in each other's company. ""When people come up the hill, they're huffing and puffing and saying things like 'I hate this hill', 'this is so nasty', and no-one told me about this hill… but they're happy, even when they're complaining. ""People stop and give me a high five, some will give me a hug. A lot of people will say 'thanks, 'volly' [volunteer]. They're all very appreciative of what I'm doing. ""It definitely feels like a family. You don't go to parkrun and feel like you're an outsider."" For others, volunteering at parkrun is their entry point to community. Born in Morocco and having lived in the Netherlands from a young age, 62-year-old Erno van Alphen arrived in Australia just over five years ago. Back in the Netherlands, he worked for an oil and gas company, before moving into superannuation. His wife Marie Louise, a registered nurse, had done some of her degree in Perth, and had always wanted to return to Australia. When he sought — but was eventually denied — a company transfer to Australia, he and his wife decided to pack up and leave anyway. ""I met a guy in Byron Bay, who was like, 'well, why don't you just do it? There's always a visa that applies to you. Just look, and you'll find one,'"" says van Alphen. ""So, I did — and then I told my boss, 'I'm quitting, we're going.'"" Three of their five daughters came with them, and they settled in Mount Keira, just out of Wollongong. Van Alphen, however, found it difficult to find a new job, and instead shifted his focus to helping his daughters settle into Australia. About four years ago, his youngest daughter took part in the Duke of Edinburgh program, which led her to volunteer at the local parkrun. Chris was never a runner, but now he’s winning ultramarathons, and he credits parkrun kicking it all off. Van Alphen offered to go along with her, initially reluctant because of his perceived difficulty with English — as well as his personality. ""I'm a little bit of a shy person, and the language was a bit of a barrier,"" he says. ""I didn't know what parkrun was, and what I had to do. I also felt responsible being the timekeeper — I didn't want to get people's times wrong. ""But they make you feel very welcome. It's kind of like a big family, after a while you get to know a lot of people."" For van Alphen, this has led to a series of encounters with people in his community that wouldn't have occurred otherwise. One parkrunner invited him to fill in for his basketball team — the sport van Alphen played back home — while another volunteer's partner helped him out when he was struggling to finish renovating his deck in time before some heavy rain. Van Alphen has also found himself providing support to others. ""One guy has just gotten divorced, so he always comes up to have a talk because he needs some social contact,"" he says. ""And now another — he just got a diagnosis of Parkinson's — and I told him, you have to keep moving, because he can't run anymore. So I'm trying to encourage him, stimulate him to do something and now he plays table tennis."" Van Alphen is also helping one parkrunner move into a nursing home. He has offered to transfer her photos and paintings from her home into her new room. Over time, these connections have helped him not only improve his English, but feel more at home in his adopted country. ""At home we still speak Dutch, so if you're not going out, you don't speak much English. Parkrun has really helped. ""I keep going back because of the family feeling: it's like an extended family.""

17,Should your doctor be prescribing art therapy to help your mental health?,health,"  Could art on prescription be the key to turning around mental ill health? Australia has one of the highest rates of mental ill health in the world. We book in time with our GP for mental health concerns more often than any other ailment. One in four of us will experience an anxiety disorder during our lifetime, and one in 10 will experience depression. The statistics paint a pretty bleak picture, but what if actually painting the picture is part of the solution? Bronwyn has always been skeptical about art therapy. She says it conjures images of privilege and pretension. ""It's a little bit wanky,"" she says, laughing. ""I kind of associate it with hipsters living in the inner city or wealthy white mums who are, like, stressed about their divorce settlement."" Bronwyn has had anxiety for most of her life, and developed PTSD after the sudden death of her brother on flight MH17 in 2014. She says the trauma she experienced means her anxiety is life-long. Even though she has a great psychologist, she was on the lookout for additional strategies to help manage it. ""Anxiety for me is something that's permanent and it's something that ebbs and flows,"" she said. ""There are periods of time when my anxiety is so heightened that talking therapy doesn't cut it, nothing cuts it, so I wanted to try something completely different. ""Also because I had some surface-level judgements about it, I wanted to put my money where my mouth is."" So, she did what she never thought she'd do. She signed on for art as therapy. Bronwyn was one of seven people from very different walks of life who signed on for an experimental program on ABC TV. It's called Space 22, and follows the seven Australians through different creative outlets such as photography, painting and singing to judge what benefits these activities can provide. If successful, the program would add to the growing calls for time engaged in the arts to be part of treatments doctors and other healthcare providers in Australia could prescribe. Space 22 follows seven strangers, each with their own lived experience of mental ill health, as they take part in an ambitious experiment to test if participating in art can help them heal. When Bronwyn walked into the art space with her fellow test subjects, her initial feelings were that of severe discomfort. ""I was really nervous and overwhelmed,"" she said. ""And I was very aware of the fact that I was with a bunch of people that I don't know."" After some initial reservations, the group began to bond over their shared experiences of mental ill health as they were guided through a range of creative outlets. Bronwyn found painting and drawing made the biggest impact on her. ""I realised a big part of it is that the focus is on the process of creating rather than the final product,"" she said. ""I found it so freeing."" Very quickly, Bronwyn found herself turning to drawing to calm her nerves for the day ahead. ""When we'd arrive in the morning, I'd just go straight in and get a piece of paper and pencils or chalk or whatever was there and start doodling until we started,"" she said. ""It was instantly calming for me because it took my focus away from the space and the cameras and the whole thing and just onto what I was doing."" She says the creative outlet is another tool in her arsenal for managing anxiety. ""I've been taught these skills and I now have the resources to, like, self-administer, in a way. ""And by that I mean literally sit down and do a drawing or painting."" Katherine Boydell, a professor of mental health at the Black Dog Institute, oversaw the experiment and says creative activities have a unique effect on the brain and the body. ""There are many studies, a burgeoning literature really, on the relationship between art and mental health and wellbeing,"" Dr Boydell says. ""It's everything from biophysiological studies, like how do your cortisol levels change in response to painting or singing? What about blood pressure, heartbeat? ""There are all sorts of measures that show the arts have an impact on us physically."" She says being engaged in the creative process helps us move past some of the intrusive thoughts and feelings mental ill health can stimulate. ""As you're engaged in the act of creating, it gives the brain an opportunity to shut out the busyness and the unwanted thoughts from anxiety — it's all pushed aside to focus on that outlet,"" she says. But there was another benefit Dr Boydell observed occurring throughout the experiment: a sense of community. ""Watching the cast working together, at least half of the activities involved group work. And so, what you observe happening are these very human connections, these sharing experiences even though [the individuals] are quite different. And so that creates a sense of 'I am not alone'."" There are growing calls for arts to be prescribed as part of a mental health treatment plan by the Australian healthcare system. Countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada already have similar programs in place, where patients can be referred on to a therapeutic arts service by their doctor. How creative arts are helping empower people living with a mental illness. While Australians may struggle to pick up an arts prescription note from their GP right now, there are plenty of ""wonderful pockets"" across the country holding social groups and building an evidence base, says Dr Boydell. ""There is a lot going on. They are being evaluated and there is research being done on them. But there is no integrated sense of bringing all of these people working in these different pockets together,"" she said. Bronwyn can't see why art as a social prescription wouldn't be embraced by the healthcare system. ""We understand the impact of exercise and movement on wellbeing, we understand the impact of medication and we understand the impact of traditional talking therapy, so why would we not also try and incorporate in creative therapy?""

18,Mother of First Nations man with disability shocked to discover support worker filmed him naked in shower,health,"  Disability royal commission hears of abuse and 'failings' at Afford day program in Sydney Incidents of ""unexplained"" injuries, clients going missing and staff stretched to the limit at a major disability provider have been under the spotlight at the disability royal commission. The incidents occurred at a time when the company expanded operations and more than tripled its revenue. A five-day hearing has examined the roles and responsibilities of the Australian Foundation for Disability — also known as Afford — to safeguard participants in their day programs from violence, abuse and neglect. It focused on the Mount Druitt day program and heard from parents of participants and former staff about their experiences between 2018 and 2021. Daniel Nuumaalii, a support worker at the day program, was jailed last year after pleading guilty to recording and sharing intimate images of Afford participants with ""high support needs"". The inquiry heard there were other incidents under investigation, including an allegation by a participant ""he was hosed down like a dog after soiling himself"". Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au. The royal commission could not fully discuss the case of 20-year-old Merna Aprem, who died while living in Afford's supported accommodation, as a coronial inquiry and legal proceedings are continuing. One of the country's longest-running disability services providers, Afford serviced 898 clients in 2016/17 and grew to 6,281 in 2021, the inquiry heard. The royal commission was told that Afford's revenue increased from $51.8 million in the financial year 2016/17 to $145.6 million in the financial year to 2021. The charity runs services across NSW, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. Samantha Taylor from the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission gave evidence that there was an ""open investigation"" into the ""alleged misuse of NDIS funding by Afford"" and ""possible breaches of the NDIS Act."" Ms Taylor said matters under investigation included that Afford's executives ""created a culture of excessive spending for staff and employees on matters unrelated to the care of participants"" and money was ""spent on extravagant functions."" The hearing was told the investigation was ""prompted"" by a story on the ABC's 7.30 program in July 2021. The charity's expansion has been rapid, but it was alleged in 2021 the safety of clients had been compromised in the chase for growth. The royal commission was told the ABC's story also prompted Afford to report an incident to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission of a client who had been sent home from respite accommodation and later taken to hospital, after being fed solid food that became ""stuck in his airway."" The man had a ""mealtime management plan which stipulated he couldn't eat solid food"" and staff were issued ""formal warning letters"" by Afford. The inquiry was told that since July 2018, there were 969 incidents where people with disability in Afford's care hadn't been given their medication. Three women gave evidence, using pseudonyms, about the experiences of their adult sons at the Mount Druitt day program. 'Lily' told of how her 27-year-old son 'Simon', who lives with ADHD, autism and epilepsy, attended the program between 2013 and 2020. Lily said the day program became ""glorified babysitting"" between 2019 and 2020, because the staff didn't have adequate training. The royal commission was told Simon came home with an ""unexplained black eye"", and Lily ""never got an answer"" about what happened. ADEs provide employment for people with disability, separate to the mainstream workforce, but some get paid as little as $2.37 per hour Another parent, 'Sally', spoke about the ""shock"" of being told by police that her 24-year-old son, 'Jason', had been abused by Nuumaalii in 2019. Images of clients were found on Nuumaalii's phone showing several people with disability ""naked in the shower, who were using the toilet or having their incontinence aids changed"". The royal commission was told there was no evidence Afford was aware of the abuse prior to it being uncovered by the police. Jason, who identifies as a First Nations man and lives with intellectual disability and autism, was filmed by Nuumaalii in the shower and at the day program at Mount Druitt. 'Suzie' gave evidence about her son 'Toby' who was also a victim of Nuumaalii. Nuumaalii filmed Toby, who lives with Down syndrome, ""semi-naked in a public toilet."" Suzie said Toby had no awareness of road safety or ""stranger danger."" Earlier this year, the disability royal commission turned its spotlight on the stories of women and girls who have experienced abuse and violence. She told the hearing that Afford took Toby and a group of clients to Bondi Beach in 2018 and he ""absconded"" and was lost for about an hour. Five months later, Toby was ""lost again"" at Mount Druitt whilst in Afford's care and was found by police in the middle of a main road. The statement of a whistleblower who was a senior executive at Afford between 2015 and 2020 was read to the inquiry. Using the pseudonym 'Rachel', she detailed her concerns around Afford's compliance, safety and quality of services. She said the former CEO would become ""aggressive"" if senior managers were not meeting targets for ""filling beds in group homes."" Rachel said staff received commissions based on the number of new clients they were able to sign-up and the amount was ""based on the size of the NDIS packages of those clients."" When she raised her issues with the former CEO, he yelled at Rachel and told her to ""grow a backbone"", the inquiry heard. The royal commission last year was told about abuse and violence that occurred in a Sydney group home. Under whistleblower protections, Rachel wrote a five-page report about her concerns and sent it to a board member, before resigning after feeling ""targeted and isolated."" 'Dianne', who spent two years working at the Mount Druitt centre, told the hearing there was a ""rapid increase"" in the number of participants. She asked Afford to restrict the number of clients because it was becoming ""dangerous."" Dianne said clients were left ""vulnerable and open"" because they were seen as ""dollar figures."" Afford appointed Joanne Toohey as its CEO in October 2021, and she gave evidence for two days alongside the chair of the Afford board, Mike Allen. Both gave the royal commission detailed information about reforms and changes to Afford's policies and procedures since Ms Toohey had taken on the new role. On Thursday, Ms Toohey was forced to apologise to the royal commission for a media statement that Afford distributed earlier in the week which offered her ""deepest sympathies"" to the witnesses and their families for the ""failings and heartache caused."" Senior counsel assisting, Pat Griffin, said Ms Toohey had put the ""organisation ahead of the needs of the individual"" by issuing the statement. He said the commission's counselling section had been contacted by a ""concerned"" family member. ""I'm truly sorry for the impact it's had,"" Ms Toohey said, referring to the statement. Chair of the royal commission, Ronald Sackville, said if Afford had wanted to make an apology, then it should have discussed this with the legal team so as to not make matters ""worse"" for the people ""traumatised"" by the events. But Afford did not use the hearing to apologise to the clients or their families for the incidents of abuse and neglect whilst in their care. Under questioning, Mr Allen, a board member since 2015, admitted that in ""hindsight"" there was more the board should have done. He agreed with Mr Griffin that Afford's risk management had been ""fundamentally deficient."" Mr Allen said Afford's board needed to ""very quickly"" look at a written apology and ""redress"" for the victims of abuse.

19,"When Parkinson’s disease started to affect her makeup artistry, Terri knew she had a job to do",health,"  Fashion and beauty innovators see opportunities for disability inclusion to cater for 'trillion-dollar' market When Parkinson's disease started preventing makeup artist Terri Bryant from being able to draw the simplest of lines, she knew she had to do something about it. Ms Bryant is part of a growing movement in the fashion and beauty industry, which is developing products for and with people with disability — recognising a virtually untapped trillion-dollar customer market. Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes tremors, balance problems and weakness, including in grip strength. Ms Bryant, who has worked for years as a professional makeup artist, started her accessible business Guide Beauty after she began to struggle using her usual cosmetic instruments. ""What I thought were simple techniques that I used to be able to knock out in 15 minutes … I just couldn't get it quite right. I couldn't get the control,"" she said. The problems she was having inspired her to design cosmetic tools that were suitable for everyone regardless of their level of disability. ""I ran home, and I pulled out my makeup kit and I pulled out my husband's tool kit. And I started prototypes,"" Ms Bryant explained. ""I actually ended up developing the brand because I got Parkinson's [and] when I got my diagnosis, there was something kind of empowering in the moment."" She launched Guide Beauty in 2020 and the business has been a huge success for representing people with disabilities. Ms Bryant tried several styles before choosing tools that were built to a universal design standard so they're comfortable for everyone. The tools are designed to have large grips, facets for resting, and bring the handle closer to the face to make the application stable and easy to use. ""We could kind of help shift the narrative so that people could understand the value of inclusive representation on a design level, because that makes sense from a business perspective,"" she said. ""That makes what is the right thing to do, also a smart business decision. ""The fact the industry has responded so well makes me realise that I don't think we're going to be alone in this space for long. I think people are going to be starting to shift their design process."" Ms Bryant is not the only one to have found their calling. James Parr admits his journey to becoming one of Australia's most sought-after models with a disability had a bumpy start. When he was dignaosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and was told his leg needed to be amputated, he thought it would ruin his life. ""I would say to my friends, 'if the leg goes, I go, I'm not doing it',"" Mr Parr said. ""When it actually came to the surgeon telling me the best option is to amputate, I was like 'cool, let's do it'. And it happened five days later."" Mr Parr was back in the gym 10 days after the surgery and said the amputation gave him a reason to start modelling, to change the narrative that having a disability was a sad outcome. ""I was like, 'I don't align with being sad or I don't align with it as a negative thing,'"" he said. ""It does bring more opportunities … I think part of why I love it and why I get myself out there and I'm so passionate about it, is representation."" He hopes to expand his public image from ""disabled model"" to ""model with a disability"". ""I'm trying to really hone my craft … I am a disabled model, but I want to be a model who has a disability … I just want to change that a bit because it's a bit devaluing."" Mr Parr has been represented by international inclusive talent agency Zebedee Talent and had just walked the 2022 Melbourne fashion week runway with his prosthetic leg in clear view. Launched in 2017, Zebedee Talent represents diverse models, with a focus on talent with disabilities, visible differences and those from the LGBTQIA+ community. Zebedee senior model booker for Australia and America, Victoria Johnson, said the disability modelling industry was a financially important but often overlooked side of the business. ""Disabled people make up 20 per cent of society so it is really important that disabled people are included and visible in such a huge industry, Ms Johnson said. ""It is the ethical right thing to do, and it is also the economically right thing to do. The spending power of disabled people worldwide is $1.2 trillion, so it makes sense for a business to be inclusive."" The fashion industry is worth $27.2 billion in Australia, but what do you do when the fashion industry wasn’t built for you? ""The spending power of disabled people worldwide is 1.2 trillion dollars so it makes sense for a business to be inclusive. ""It is really important for people with disabilities to feel represented and to feel self-worth."" Zebedee was started in the UK by two sisters-in-law both with experience in modelling and disability support. The agency represents some famous talents including British Model Ellie Goldstein, who has down syndrome. Zebedee only launched in Australia last year and already represents 60 talent with over 600 worldwide. According to Ms Johnson and Zebedee junior model booker, Maddie Kalman, Australia is leading the way for disability representation in the industry. ""I think it's really important to be diverse in that way in the fashion industry in Australia,"" Ms Kalman said. ""I think Australia is getting there with diverse and inclusive representation, we still have a long way to go, but we won't stop until 20 per cent of people featured in advertising and fashion are inclusive of people with disabilities. ""But I think it's really important … even if there's not room, let's make room."" Ms Johnson said some of the important international fashion events in Europe, America and the UK did not always make room for models with disabilities. ""We're not sure why they're struggling with inclusivity in fashion shows, to be honest,"" Ms Johnson said. ""It feels like you take a step forward and one or two back, but hopefully we can get to that place again, with our models working in the major places. ""We were really successful at Melbourne fashion week. Most of the shows did include a model with a disability or difference, which was awesome."" In Australia, adaptive clothes are considered assistive technology and can be purchased through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Emma Clegg, occupational therapist and co-founder of adaptive clothing company JAM-the-Label said the NDIS had made it easier for people to purchase high-end accessible clothes. ""The Australian market is quite unique in that we have the NDIS, a lot of other countries don't have a similar funding model,"" Ms Clegg said. ""And so people can actually purchase adaptive clothing through their NDIS plans as low-cost assistive technology because it assists in active dressing and promotes independence and participation in an everyday skill or task."" Ms Clegg and her business partner launched JAM in 2017 to help people like their clients wear comfortable and fashionable clothing that worked better in wheelchairs. Some of the design features include shorter backs on jackets so extra fabric doesn't bunch up between the wearer and the wheelchair, fully zippable sleeves and sides on tops, poncho-style opening on jackets, carry bags and the absence of itchy tags. JAM model Jason Clymo said the NDIS made it easier for him to buy comfortable adaptive clothes instead of mainstream items that caused pressure sores. ""Before I was on the NDIS, I actually didn't even really engage very much with the adaptive fashion industry because I didn't really know much about it,"" Mr Clymo said. ""It was actually through meeting JAM-the-Label that I realised that adaptive fashion was becoming quite a large part of the industry and realising that this was actually a really good option for me."" Ms Kalman said tokenism was still a problem in the industry, with a lot of major brands booking one model with a disability just for publicity. ""They're getting the jobs which is great, but it's like some brands are just ticking a box and they're having like a token disabled person to make themselves look inclusive, but they're not really,"" she said. Mr Clymo, who has represented mainstream modelling agency Wink as well as Zebedee, said he hoped in the future segregation in the fashion industry would vanish. He said having models with and without a disability showcasing the same products would hopefully educate the industry more broadly, and the practice would become mainstream.

20,'This is not the kind of spread we’ve seen in West Africa': Scientists scratch heads as monkeypox spreads through Europe,health,"  Monkeypox spreading through the West as UK records 11 new cases Cases of monkeypox are growing in the West in people who have not travelled to Africa — a phenomena previously not seen before. The United Kingdom recorded 11 cases on Friday, bringing the total to 20. Portugal recorded nine new cases, bringing the total there to 23. France, Germany, Canada and Belgium all confirmed their first cases of monkeypox on Friday. Australia has recorded two cases, one in Melbourne and one in Sydney in travellers recently returned from the UK. ""I'm stunned by this. Every day I wake up and there are more countries infected,"" said Oyewale Tomori, a virologist who formerly headed the Nigerian Academy of Science and who sits on several World Health Organization advisory boards. ""This is not the kind of spread we've seen in West Africa, so there may be something new happening in the West."" One of the theories British health officials are exploring is whether the disease is being sexually transmitted. Health officials have asked doctors and nurses to be on alert for potential cases, but said the risk to the general population is low. Outbreaks in Nigeria, which reports about 3,000 monkeypox cases a year, are usually in rural areas, where people have close contact with infected rats and squirrels, according to Dr Tomori. He said the disease is not spread very easily and that many cases are likely missed. ""Unless the person ends up in an advanced health centre, they don't attract the attention of the surveillance system,"" he said. Dr Tomori hoped the appearance of monkeypox cases across Europe and other Western countries would further scientific understanding of the disease. The World Health Organization's lead on emergency response, Dr. Ibrahima Soce Fall, acknowledged this week that there were still ""so many unknowns in terms of the dynamics of transmission, the clinical features (and) the epidemiology."" British officials have noted that the most recent cases have all been in young men who had no history of travel to Africa and were gay, bisexual, or had sex with men. Authorities in Spain and Portugal also said their cases were in young men who mostly had sex with other men and said those cases were picked up when the men turned up with lesions at sexual health clinics. Experts have stressed they do not know if the disease is being spread through sex, or other close contact related to sex. ""This is not something we've seen in Nigeria,"" Dr Tomori said. He said viruses that hadn't initially been known to transmit via sex, like Ebola, were later proven to do so after bigger epidemics showed different patterns of spread. The same could be true of monkeypox, Dr Tomori said. ""We would have to go back through our records to see if this might have happened, like between a husband and wife,"" he said. A handful of monkeypox cases have been reported across Europe over the past few weeks, but what is this virus? In Germany, Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said the government was confident the outbreak could be contained. He said the virus was being sequenced to see if there were any genetic changes that might have made it more infectious. Scientists said that while it's possible the outbreak's first patient caught the disease while in Africa, what's happening now is exceptional. ""We've never seen anything like what's happening in Europe,"" Christian Happi, director of the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases, said. ""We haven't seen anything to say that the transmission patterns of monkeypox have been changing in Africa, so if something different is happening in Europe, then Europe needs to investigate that."" Dr Happi also pointed out that the suspension of smallpox vaccination campaigns after the disease was eradicated in 1980 might inadvertently be helping monkeypox spread. Smallpox vaccines also protect against monkeypox, but mass immunisation was stopped decades ago. ""Aside from people in west and Central Africa who may have some immunity to monkeypox from past exposure, not having any smallpox vaccination means nobody has any kind of immunity to monkeypox,"" Dr Happi said. Shabir Mahdi, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said a detailed investigation of the outbreak in Europe, including determining who the first patients were, was now critical. ""We need to really understand how this first started and why the virus is now gaining traction,"" he said. ""In Africa, there have been very controlled and infrequent outbreaks of monkeypox. If that's now changing, we really need to understand why.""

21,Last survivor of one of WWII's most brutal prisoner camps dies from COVID-19,health,"  Billy Young — known as the last survivor of the Sandakan camp — has died, aged 96, from COVID-19. Surrounded by family in Hobart, Mr Young was crucial in remembering one of the most atrocious and neglected chapters in Australia's wartime history. After the fall of Singapore in World War II, nearly 2,500 Commonwealth troops became prisoners of war in Borneo. They were transported by the Japanese to Sandakan, where they were used as slave labour to build an airfield. By the end of the war, just six of them were alive. Joining the army at age 15, Mr Young had lied his way into the Australian Imperial Force with a forged signature from a fictitious aunt. Speaking on ABC's Australia Wide program in 2016, he recalled lining-up to be enlisted with a friend. ""We asked: 'How old do you gotta be?' He said 19', so we said we were 19,"" Mr Young said. Orphaned as a child, Mr Young had nothing to lose and was looking for adventure. His mother had walked out when he was one and his father died in the Spanish Civil War a decade later. Soon after his 16th birthday, the Allies crumbled under the Japanese and Young found himself as a prisoner of war at Changi. From there, he was shipped to Borneo with hundreds of soldiers who endured harsh conditions at Sandakan: a lack of food and water, the spread of disease and prisoners being beaten, caged and tortured by the Japanese. ""People have said to me I bet you are sorry you joined the army and I said: 'No fear. It's the greatest thing I ever did',"" Mr Young recalled during the interview. ""It put me in line with good people, men who would stand no nonsense, whatever age you were."" After a failed escape at Sandakan, Mr Young was sent to the notorious Outram Road Gaol, where he spent six months in solitary confinement, forced to sit cross-legged for hours at a time. Upon returning to Sydney, he wanted to reunite with his friends but could not find them. Many had died when the Japanese forced them to march, as near skeletons, 250 kilometres through the virtually impenetrable jungle from Sandakan to Ranau. For years, his family knew nothing of his time as a teenage prisoner of war. ""We had no one who understood the trauma. There are still stories I cannot tell. I bawl like a little baby,"" he said. Mr Young survived the Japanese brutality. However, he watched other POWs suffer from starvation and the worst violence. One such victim was a young Aboriginal soldier, Jimmy Darlington, who had dared to strike a Japanese soldier for washing his clothes in the prisoners' cooking pot. He was bound and tied to sharp stakes of wood and left to suffer. ""One of the Japs grabbed a bucket of water,"" Mr Young says. ""Another was grabbing ropes and he put it in the water, and knelt him on the platform and tied him down with ropes, or wet ropes. ""The sun started to shine and dried the ropes. And the ropes tightened up, right up, and cut right into his wrists and his legs."" Only after Mr Young and his mates created a diversion to distract the Japanese could another Australian soldier — an ambulance officer — move in to cut the ropes. Without it, Mr Young said, Darlington would have died. During the interview with the ABC in 2016, Mr Young's daughter, Susan, said she tried to speak to her father about his time in the war but was quickly dismissed. ""When I was about nine years old, I did ask dad a question and I just got such a strong, negative reaction from him,"" she said. ""I just knew so I never raised the subject again."" In his later years, Mr Young took up painting and poetry as a form of therapy and, at age 90, wrote a book with co-author and historian and friend Lynette Silver. ""He was the last surviving link and, in many ways, even if he didn't know people who died there, their relatives felt he was someone tangible who they could talk and relate to,"" Ms Silver said. ""Billy was a survivor because he was a larrikin. He always saw the best side of life. ""He was eternally grateful that he had survived what almost everybody else did not, so every day was a bonus for him and he lived life to the fullest.""

22,Adelaide man who shot dead three people asks court for a change of scenery,health,"  Lawyer for Hectorville man who killed three people asks court not to 'throw away the key' A lawyer for a man who shot dead his neighbour and two of their relatives more than a decade ago has pared back an application for supervised release, asking that he be allowed out into the hospital grounds for a change of scenery. Donato Anthony Corbo, now 50, has been detained in a secure psychiatric facility since being found not guilty by reason of mental incompetence of multiple counts of murder and attempted murder and a charge of endangering life. In April 2011, Corbo shot dead his neighbour, Luc Mombers, and Mr Mombers' parents-in-law, Korbus and Annetjie Snyman, who were visiting from South Africa. Mr Mombers' wife, Rika Mombers, and teenage son, Marcel, survived the attack at Hectorville in Adelaide's east, as did two police officers who were injured when they attended the scene. Last year, a decade after the offending, Corbo's lawyer lodged an application for supervised release into the community. However, on Friday in the Supreme Court, lawyer Trish Johnson said she had ""narrowed"" the application after discussions with the prosecution, who remain strongly opposed to any form of release. Ms Johnson said that she was now only seeking permission for her client, who has schizophrenia and an intellectual impairment, to walk around the unfenced grounds of the facility, accompanied by two staff members. ""If the court doesn't allow the application in my respectful submission, it's tantamount to saying, 'We throw away the key',"" Ms Johnson said. ""If all the experts are supporting release on licence and all the experts say he's a low risk — which is as good as it gets, if I can put it that way your Honour — then there's no hope of him ever being in a position to ask the court to let him dip his toe in the water and at least attempt rehabilitation with short walks."" Prosecutor Tracey Nelson urged the court to take a cautious approach, saying legislative changes had made it clear that the safety of the community should outweigh any restrictions on a defendant's freedoms. ""Even with the proposed stringency [of the application] … the director still holds firm that the safety of the community will not be adequately protected by any form of release at this time,"" Ms Nelson told the court. Ms Johnson said the application for supervised walks in the hospital grounds did not put the community at risk. ""I agree the court should take a cautious approach but, in my submission, periods of leave for one hour on the grounds of the hospital campus with two staff is a very cautious approach."" Ms Johnson said other killers detained in secure mental health facilities were often given longer periods of leave in the community. Under legislation that governs court orders on mentally incompetent offenders, the court must take into account psychiatric evidence as well as the views of the victims and their next of kin. Justice Tim Stanley reserved his decision, saying he wanted to carefully consider all the submissions and expert reports.

23,Do you cook with gas at home? Scientists want you to switch to a 'healthier' alternative — and they want governments to help,health,"  Scientists call for incentives to help households transition away from gas use in homes Scientists are calling on Australian governments to provide incentives to enable households to transition away from using gas in the home because of its detrimental health effects. Leaking methane from natural gas-burning stove tops is releasing the greenhouse-gas equivalent of hundreds of thousands of cars, and cooking on gas stovetops is posing a risk to health. Additionally, more than three-quarters of methane emissions from stovetops are leaking into houses while the appliances are not in use. In a newly released report from the Menzies Institute for Medical Research and the Centre for Air Pollution, Energy and Health Research (CAR), scientists found gas use for cooking and heating produced a variety of air pollutants that affected lung health, especially for those with asthma. Professor Graeme Zosky — CAR's chief investigator and the deputy director of the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research — said there was evidence to show that around 12 per cent of childhood asthma could be attributed to gas cooking stoves. ""That is a huge number when we consider that Australia has around 460,000 children with asthma,"" he said. ""Marketing campaigns have promoted the idea that cooking with gas isn't only the most efficient way of cooking, but that gas is a clean way to cook and heat homes. ""In reality, gas use in the home worsens air quality and this has impacts on people's health and, in particular, their respiratory health. ""We know there are a variety of steps people can take to minimise the risk to their health when it comes to gas use inside the home, including improved ventilation and replacing your gas appliances with electric ones."" Asthma Australia's policy and advocacy manager, Angela Cartwright, said children were more vulnerable to the effects of burning gas due to their small, developing lungs. ""We think it's important to do everything we can to reduce the incidents of asthma in children and [to] give our kids better health outcomes,"" she said. ""Asthma is a complex disease that has many causes but, in the case of gas stoves, it's very clear that the nitrogen dioxide that is produced by these stoves is more harmful for kids when it comes to asthma. ""It's really important that people are aware that gas stoves can be a problem in terms of children developing asthma, and also triggering symptoms for children who do have asthma already."" In light of the new findings, researchers said governments should help people make the switch to safer alternatives. They proposed incentives that would include subsidy schemes for low-income households, and want to see the introduction of new policies to ensure better ventilation of homes, with a focus on social housing and rentals and the introduction of a national indoor air quality framework. ""Incentives should also be provided to allow schools, workplaces and residential aged care facilities to monitor their air quality and [to] meet these new indoor standards,"" Professor Zosky said. Ms Cartwright said the proposed incentives were a good idea. ""A lot of vulnerable households won't be able to switch easily from gas stoves to a healthier, safer alternative, like an electric or induction stove,"" she said. ""We definitely think there's a role for governments to provide support to those vulnerable households, so their children aren't at greater risk of developing asthma as a result of preparing healthy food at home for them."" However, until the proposal was accepted, Ms Cartwright said, there was a range of options for people who still needed to cook with gas at home until they could switch to an alternative appliance. ""The most simple thing you can do is open windows while you've cooking, [and] if you have a range hood over the stove it's absolutely critical to use it. ""Another option for some people might be that, while they're cooking, they don't have the children in the kitchen at the same time."" It is not the first time an incentive has been introduced to help reduce health impacts. In Launceston, the city ran a buyback scheme nearly two decades ago that saw up to 2,000 wood heaters removed from the city and surrounds, but it needed $2 million from the federal government. James Markos was one of the specialist doctors involved in the campaign to reduce smoke in the city. ""Breathing in wood smoke is like you're smoking,"" he said. ""It's not like you're breathing in 20 cigarettes a day, but it's like you're breathing in one cigarette a day. ""And we know there's no safe level of smoking, and we also know there's no safe level of airborne air pollution."" The program was ultimately effective, with air pollution falling almost 40 per cent. Experts estimated there were 28 per cent fewer respiratory-related deaths that winter. ""Your smoke is adding to general pollution and that's then causing ill health to the population,"" Dr Markos said. ""Everybody, no matter whether you are young, old, healthy … everybody exposed to wood smoke is at risk long-term of developing lung cancer.""

24,'No effective follow up': NT coroner recommends sweeping changes after death of teenage boy,health,"  NT Coroner recommends sweeping changes to government departments after death of teenager Reginald Roy Yunupingu A teenage boy who died in a remote Aboriginal community in 2020 ""was not afforded basic mental health care"" and was wrongly ""screened out"" by a government social services department,  the Northern Territory Acting Coroner has found. Reginald 'Reggie' Roy Yunupingu, 17, was known to enjoy climbing structures. In October 2020, the teenager was found at the base of a power pole near the Minyerri Police Station, 240 kilometres south-east of Katherine, after climbing the pole, touching a wire and plummeting to the ground. There was no suggestion his death was suicide. Reginald had been released from a youth inpatient mental health facility in Darwin about six months before his death, where he was treated for psychosis and hallucinations. A 17-year-old boy who died after he was electrocuted in a Northern Territory remote community had been discharged from an inpatient mental health facility about six months prior, a court hears on the first day of a coronial inquest. But despite making strides towards recovery during the 10 weeks he spent as an inpatient at the Royal Darwin Hospital, Reginald was ""lost to care"" within nine days of his release. ""This was not a child that 'fell through the cracks' of service delivery, it was as if he fell from a cliff,"" Acting Coroner Elisabeth Armitage wrote in her findings. ""He did not receive his monthly depot medication in the six months that followed [his discharge]. ""It appears there was no effective follow up of Reginald because there was no person or organisation that understood it to be their role to ensure continuity of his care."" His sister, who had been suffering from a similar condition, was also treated at the youth inpatient facility, and had also been discharged to family around the same time as Reginald. The coronial inquest in March 2022 heard she had not been ""lost to care"". Reginald was released from the youth inpatient facility to the care of family members, one of whom had not met with health staff prior to the discharge. Ms Armitage found they quickly became overwhelmed with the responsibility, reaching out for help the day after his release. Government department, Territory Families, was contacted around a week after Reginald's discharge and told there was ""no safe persons in Darwin capable of caring for [Reginald and his sister]"", as his father had his own mental health issues and his mother had not been his main carer for years. However, despite it being the 13th notification in relation to Reginald, Territory Families ""screened out"" the case due to ""insufficient information to suggest the children have been neglected or placed at risk of neglect."" ""[Reginald and his sister] were children that may have been in need of care and protection … the combined history of referrals should have raised proper consideration as to whether or not Reginald had suffered from cumulative harm,"" Ms Armitage wrote. Reginald's outpatient mental health care was initially the responsibility of Headspace, however when they were informed that he was going to leave Darwin for a remote community, his file was closed. The coroner heard staff at the youth inpatient facility referred Reginald's case to the Katherine Mental Health Service and community clinics, despite the usual practise being for Headspace to make the referral. Reginald moved to Minyerri from Darwin with his mother sometime after June 2020 and the coroner found no evidence he engaged with mental health services there. ""There was a lack of clarity on the part of the family as to who had responsibility for Reginald's outpatient care,"" Ms Armitage wrote. ""Without a single point of call, there was a risk that the full picture of their concerns about Reginald's apparent deterioration and vulnerabilities could be missed."" An inquest into the death of a 17-year-old boy in a remote NT community hears the boy was ‘lost’ to the systems designed to support him within days of being released from a mental health facility. The coroner ultimately recommended the Child and Adolescent Mental Health team be responsible for engaging relevant service providers in communities, for remote patients who are discharged from the youth inpatient unit. She also recommended the Department of Territory Families, Housing and Communities review its intake procedures to broaden the range of issues it considers when deciding if a child needs protection. The coroner heard Territory Families had since introduced some procedural changes since Reginald's death, and she recommended they also include a ""Further Inquiries"" case type and workflow in its case management system. Ms Armitage noted Reginald had been ""well cared for"" during his stay at the youth inpatient unit and his death had ""genuinely affected"" the staff who cared for him. She described his death as a ""tragedy."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

25,Heavy police presence blamed for shift towards one major party among Western Sydney voters,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes In a Sydney cafe, Izzat Khatib can expertly manoeuvre the delicate handles on a coffee machine to make a full-bodied espresso. It's almost a reflex after 22 years as a cafe owner in the Western Sydney suburb of Bankstown. Over his two decades in business, the father-of-six has experienced the impacts of a changing economy on his small business many times. However, in those years, he had never experienced anything like the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020 that forced him to shut his doors for more than two months. When he could finally reopen, Mr Khatib and other business owners in the shopping centre had to contend with a newly imposed — and major — police presence, a COVID-19 measure enforced by the state government. He remembers 15 police officers patrolling just outside the cafe doors, and said it was a clear deterrent to takeaway customers. ""As a business, we struggled,"" he said. ""I was sitting here turning over around $80 a day. ""They were questioning why you were coming into the centre. They were quite heavy-handed. It was intimidating. ""It seems to have been more in the west than anywhere else."" It led to a disillusionment with the major parties. Then, one day, he discovered his regular customer, John Koukoulis, was also a member of Clive Palmer's United Australia Party (UAP). Mr Koukoulis is now the UAP candidate in the Sydney seat of Watson, and Mr Khatib is a member of the UAP backing his campaign. A Palestinian Muslim by heritage, Mr Khatib said it was not so much his multicultural background that directed him towards the party, but rather his experience as a small business owner in the working-class suburb during COVID-19. ""Definitely the biggest thing was [UAP's] no lockdown [policy],"" he said. Clive Palmer says he plans to spend about $70 million on the coming federal election campaign. Here's how the massive campaign budget could influence the federal election. It's almost a protest vote, and he feels other major and minor parties have little to offer him. ""Sometimes in life we need a change. So it's always been Labor-Liberal. I don't think anyone [here] looks at One Nation, obviously,"" he said. ""UAP seems to be more honest actually, you feel that. ""There is a sense [Clive Palmer] is my next door neighbour, he is my friend."" Mr Khatib said that, despite appearances from its larger-than-life founder — Queensland billionaire Clive Palmer, who fronts much of the party's advertising — the UAP was a very multicultural party. ""It's the most multicultural you'll ever see … It's all walks of life,"" he said. The UAP's support among multicultural groups is being noted anecdotally by observers as one of the unexpected trends to emerge during the 2022 election campaign. An uptick in support has also been seen in focus groups of UAP voters conducted by RedBridge, a political consultancy that has worked with Labor, minor parties and independent candidates. ""We get a very … culturally diverse representation,"" RedBridge's Simon Welsh said. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au One of the issues that comes up frequently is resentment over lockdowns. ""It's certainly feeding into it. And that experience is being replicated in our research, in terms of when we do focus groups with UAP voters,"" he said. Mr Khatib said that, among the Muslims he knows, ""there's a lot of talk going around about the UAP"". Adel Salman from the Islamic Council of Victoria was not surprised. He said harsh lockdowns in Western Sydney were viewed by many to be targeting Muslim areas, and long lockdowns in Melbourne had also built up a reservoir of resentment. ""When you have a populist party talking against that and talking about freedom of the individual and freedom from lockdowns, etc., I'm not that surprised that … there may be some people within the Muslim community who would actually be supportive,"" he said. Mr Salman said the UAP might perform better than expected in areas such as Western Sydney and Melbourne's outer suburbs, but ""that would still be … a minimal number of votes"" overall. The Islamic Council of Victoria ran a survey of Muslim Australian voters this month. Lockdowns did not emerge as a leading issue. ""[It] didn't register as one of the top concerns, but other areas did: Religious discrimination, Islamophobia … [have] come up quite often,"" he said. Mr Koukoulis himself is from a Greek background and is chief executive of registered training organisation Ransford College. He said the UAP appealed to a diverse group of people. ""We've got young people. We have Muslims, non-Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists,"" he said. ""They know that I relate to them and they relate to me and I'm their voice."" However, it remains to be seen whether these anecdotal trends will play out in the numbers once ballots are counted. Watson is held by long-time Labor MP Tony Burke, with a margin of more than 17 per cent, and is considered a very safe Labor seat. At the 2019 election there was a 3.7 per cent swing away from Labor and the UAP picked up 4.2 per cent of the vote, or about 3,500 votes. Polls suggest that UAP will have support from about 4 per cent of the electorate, including in Watson, but some analysts believe the party's support could be underestimated by polling to date. ""Certainly the vote looks [to be] going up,"" Mr Welsh said. He said RedBridge's research suggested the stigma of admitting to be a UAP supporter was fading fast. But it's still not easy for pollsters to reach UAP voters. ""They're just very difficult people to get into the research process,"" he said. ""They're difficult to get on the phone. It's difficult to get them to answer a poll because, [for] so many of them, the core problem is that they don't feel like the political system responds to them."" Mr Koukoulis is sending his preferences in the lower house to One Nation and then the Coalition, with Labor and then The Greens last. Elsewhere, Watson voter Diane Yammine has also signed up to the UAP. The mother-of-three said she felt the two major parties were not offering anything new and was particularly attracted to UAP's policy of capping housing interest rates at 3 per cent. A cap on mortgage repayments would come as welcome relief for millions of borrowers. But can it be done and who would end up paying for it? ""I love UAP policies on interest rates and freedom of religion,"" she said. ""They're not just sort of sticking to policies that don't work. ""They're looking outside the square."" She, too, was unhappy with the NSW Liberal-National state government's handling of COVID-19 lockdowns. ""There was just a lot of forcefulness going on and our voice was taken away, and a lot of control,"" she said. ""It just made me want to see what else is out there."" Coming from a Lebanese Christian background Ms Yammine said she did not view the UAP as a homogenous party, the way some might. ""It's definitely multicultural. It's very diverse,"" she said. While the UAP's chances are rated as low by the experts, Mr Khatib will be watching Saturday's election result closely. ""Will they win? I hope so. I reckon they might give it a very good shake.""

26,More than 200 West Australians with COVID have now died this year as cases continue to swell,health," Coronavirus More than 200 West Australians have now died with COVID-19 this year, as the state continues to grapple with surging cases. WA has recorded another 15,205 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of active infections to 89,895. Of those, 304 are in hospital, including 11 in intensive care. Another five deaths have been recorded, bringing the total number of COVID-related fatalities in WA this year to 203. With the number of people stuck in isolation with COVID-19 continuing to climb, Premier Mark McGowan said ""way more"" than 3,000 health staff were currently furloughed because of the virus. He said in the ambulance service, about 40 per cent of staff were absent because of COVID. It means St John Ambulance will be running 15 per cent fewer ambulances than usual during the day today, with 69 vehicles on the road rather than 82. Premier Mark McGowan says WA's ambulance service could have asked the Department of Fire and Emergency Services for help on the night Georgina Wild died. ""I don't think there's any avoiding the fact that that is a difficult situation for any workforce to manage,"" Mr McGowan said. ""It's occurring more so among our health workforce because of the people they work with, and also because of the fact that many of them have kids at school who become COVID-positive who then bring it home."" But he said the government was doing everything it could to manage the situation, including by placing health and police staff in St John's control room and preparing firefighters to drive ambulances. After a parliamentary inquiry into WA's ambulance service tabled its findings yesterday, Mr McGowan today committed to not bringing the service into the public sector. One of the inquiry's 48 recommendations was that St John Ambulance be given five years to improve its service, before considering a new provider or for the government to take control. The Premier said he thought that recommendation was ""reasonable"". ""Frankly I don't think it will occur, that it would come back in-house,"" he said. ""But monitoring and making sure there's better performance, I think, is a really, really good thing to do."" The Australian Medical Association's WA president, Mark Duncan-Smith said he was pleased and surprised by that outcome. ""I think that they suggested to continue with the St John's contract because if they didn't do that at the moment, it would have brought too much pressure to bear and too much light on the lack of capacity that the McGowan government has created in the hospital system due to neglect over the last five years,"" he said. When asked about ambulance ramping, Mr McGowan seemed to point the finger partially at GPs. While many in Western Australia are enjoying new freedoms, some in the community are choosing to stay home. He said doctors were pushing patients toward hospital emergency departments by putting up signs asking people with respiratory illnesses not to come in. ""I would request that GPs don't do that. I'd just ask, don't do that,"" he said. ""Isn't the Hippocratic Oath that you're supposed to allow anyone to come in and receive medical attention? ""So I'd just ask our GPs across the state, if people are unwell, please deal with them. Referring them to our emergency departments just puts additional pressure onto our hospitals."" The President of the Royal Australian College of GPs, Karen Price, was critical of Mr McGowan's comments, saying they showed a lack of understanding. ""Some general practices are not big enough to actually see respiratory patients,"" she said. ""If a doctor or their staff becomes unwell with COVID then the whole clinic has to often shut down if it's a small clinic, and this is particularly relevant for rural and remote regions. ""Given that GPs have done 117 million or so services in the last year, I think it's cheeky to say that GPs have not been lifting their weight."" Professor Price said GPs needed more support, and that governments of all levels needed to come together to find a way to provide that help. Dr Duncan-Smith also leapt to the defence of GPs.""GPs out in the community are doing a great job. GPs are keeping people out of hospital,"" he said. ""This is another attempt to use another scapegoat to blame for the McGowan [government's] lack of investment in capacity of the hospital system over the last five years."" Opposition Leader Mia Davies said the Premier should not be trying to blame others for issues in the health system. ""This Premier needs to accept that under his watch, for the last five years, this government has overseen a crumbling health system. They have underinvested and they are now trying to spend their way out of a crisis,"" she said. ""He needs to concentrate on repairing the health system instead of deflecting to other organisations."" May looks set to be the worst month this year for ambulance ramping, with paramedics so far spending an average of 189 hours a day parked outside hospitals waiting to transfer patients. That is higher than the daily rate recorded in March, when WA recorded its previous peak in ramped hours for the year. It comes as the government made a last-minute change to the state's COVID rules ahead of tomorrow's election. Signed by Acting Police Commissioner Col Blanch yesterday morning, the directions mean asymptomatic close contacts, who would otherwise have to stay in isolation, will be allowed out to vote. That's provided they wear a mask, return a negative rapid antigen test in the two hours before leaving isolation and go straight to and from their nearest polling place. At the last count, about 24 per cent of West Australian voters had cast their ballot early. And while the Australian Electoral Commission had been worried it would not have enough staff to operate some polling booths in WA, it said in a statement on Friday afternoon that all positions had been filled. But Commissioner Tom Rogers warned that was not the end of the issue. ""If some of the small number of people we've lined up to work at a local voting centre withdraw on the morning of the election, we may not have back ups available in that town,"" he said. ""To those people working for us tomorrow, thank you for putting your hand up. Please, unless you wake up COVID-positive, come in to work to make sure that your polling place can open. ""To voters, if there is a queue, remember to treat our staff with kindness. You wouldn't have a local polling place with them."" Some WA businesses claim they may be forced to close their doors due to staffing shortages, with cases expected to peak at 25,000 in the coming weeks. Bespoke by Barista HQ cafe in Victoria Park has faced extreme staffing pressures due to staff either contracting the virus or having to isolate. Owner Maureen Chandwani said despite being located on one of Perth's busiest cafe and retail strips, her business was struggling to survive. ""I think nearly 70 per cent of our staff at different times have been affected by COVID,"" she said. ""So we've had a stretch where for 14 days, we did not have staff members on the job and we didn't know how to sustain the business."" Ms Chandwani and her husband have owned the cafe and barista training centre for nearly four years and usually have 15 workers on the floor. ""On Mother's Day we did not advertise at all, [because] we didn't even know if we were going to be open or not,"" she said. ""We had no chef in the kitchen because he got COVID, we had no baristas because they got COVID. So it was just basically my husband and myself. ""Even on the weekends where we are really busy, people are waiting for their food for like 40 to 45 minutes, and that's become normal now."" Ms Chandwani said the situation had left her ""emotionally stressed and drained"", knowing she may have no other option but to shut the doors. ""It's very, very hard at the moment to sustain the business, to be able to pay the rent, to be able to pay the wages, because the numbers have dropped a lot,"" she said. ""There are government grants and stuff like that, but they're just not enough to cover all the cost. We're just trying to hold the fort and somehow move on."" Other businesses in the area have also told similar tales, with Indian restaurant Colaba Social delaying its opening by a couple of months due to understaffing. ""It's picking up now since we opened and the restrictions have come down but before that, we were struggling to find the staff,"" chef Shyam Verma said. ""Sometimes staff get COVID and then sometimes three or four people have to isolate, which has really affected us on the busy nights as well [because] we can't provide the good customer service. ""It's very hard when we're really short of staff and everybody has like a lot of other commitments back home, like I have a family with kids so I can't be working many long hours.""

27,Monkeypox confirmed in Melbourne and Sydney,health,"  Monkeypox confirmed in Melbourne and Sydney Two cases of monkeypox have been confirmed, one in Melbourne and another in Sydney. The case in Melbourne is a man in his 30s who developed mild symptoms before returning home from London on May 16, and then sought medical attention. He remains in isolation at the Alfred Hospital with mild symptoms. Monkeypox is a viral infection which does not spread easily between people and tends to be mild in presentation. Dozens of cases have been either confirmed or are under investigation across the US, Canada, Europe and the UK in recent weeks. It has raised alarm because the disease is usually only found in west and central Africa, and rarely spreads elsewhere. A handful of monkeypox cases have been reported across Europe over the past few weeks, but what is this virus? Meanwhile NSW health authorities have confirmed the virus has been identified in a man who recently returned to Sydney from Europe. The man, in his 40s, went to his GP with mild symptoms several days after landing in NSW. It was determined his symptoms were clinically compatible with monkeypox and urgent testing was carried out. It's the first case to be confirmed in the state. Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said the virus was not a cause for panic given its low level of transmissibility between humans. ""Usually, you need to have quite prolonged face-to-face contact,"" Dr Chant said. ""It is not the same spread mechanism as COVID or the flu, where it [transmission] is more fleeting."" However, Dr Chant said, people should still remain vigilant about potential symptoms of the virus. ""It starts off with fever, muscle aches and pains. You can get those in large lymph nodes, headaches, feeling tired and lethargic,"" she explained. ""And then it can be followed by a rash one to three days longer. Often the rash starts on the face."" The man and a close contact are now isolating at home with care and support being provided by NSW Health and his GP. People who were on the same flights back to Australia as the man who has tested positive in Melbourne are being contacted by Victorian health authorities, and are being asked to isolate only if they develop symptoms. The affected flights are: Victoria's Department of Health has begun contact tracing, and some of the man's close contacts will be offered a vaccine, which can be effective up to four days after potential exposure. The state's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton also urged people who were on those flights to watch for symptoms. ""Those symptoms are flu-like symptoms, they can be headache, fever, muscle aches and pains,"" he said. ""Generally people are more unwell than with a mild cold so it can be quite significant constitutional symptoms. ""Then a rash occurs with those typical chicken pox-like lesions that occur — so fluid-filled, pus-filled."" Professor Sutton said there were early indications the ""few dozen cases"" across Europe and North America were a version of the disease from west Africa that is milder than other forms. But he said that version of monkeypox still had a fatality rate of between 1 and 5 per cent. ""The transmission of the virus can be through the fluids, the material within lesions in those pox,"" he said. ""There can also be respiratory transmission for people who are in close contact with each another... or close skin-to-skin contact."" Professor Sutton said the risk of transmission was ""not great"" and described the monkeypox virus as ""rare"". NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said an alert had been issued to GPs, hospitals and sexual health services across the state to be aware of cases being identified overseas. ""Cases are occasionally reported in non-endemic countries in returning travellers or their close contacts, or in owners of imported pets,"" Dr Chant said. ""People can contract monkeypox through very close contact with people who are infected with the virus. ""The infection is usually a mild illness and most people recover within a few weeks."" Health experts have added that it's highly unusual for monkeypox to be detected across multiple continents, given the virus does not easily spread from person to person. University of New South Wales Global Biosecurity Professor Raina MacIntyre, said there's seemingly no known link between the cases. ""At this stage, it looks like there's not a clear relationship from one case to the next and so people are trying to speculate as to why this is and has there been a whole lot of transmission that hasn't been noticed which would be you know asymptomatic transmission."" Monkeypox was first found in monkeys in 1958, but rats are now considered the main carrier.

28,"Actress Marnie Schulenburg dies, aged 37, two years after cancer diagnosis",health,"  As the World Turns star Marnie Schulenburg dies, aged 37, two years after breast cancer diagnosis Actress Marnie Schulenburg has died of cancer at the age of 37, two years after she was diagnosed with stage-four metastatic breast cancer. Representatives for Schulenburg, best known for her roles on As the World Turns and One Life To Live, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that the soap star died on Tuesday at a hospital in the US state of New Jersey. She is survived by her husband Zack Robidas, who had roles on Succession and Sorry for Your Loss, and their two-year-old daughter Coda. ""Please don't say Marnie lost her battle to cancer. It's simply not true. I watched her kick cancer's ass every day since diagnosis,"" Robidas said, according to Variety. ""She is incredible. We chose to attack her diagnosis with blind optimism. We only talked about the future and continued moving forward. I don’t know if this was right but it's all we knew how to do."" On social media, fans have paid tribute to the actress, who had documented her battle with cancer after initially being misdiagnosed with mastitis. She had described it as an ""insidious"" and ""aggressive"" disease that affects ""younger women, and disguises itself as a breastfeeding infection"". In her final Instagram post on Mother's Day, Schulenburg reflected her diagnosis two years earlier, saying she ""truly thought my life was over"". ""So here’s to remembering that nothing is permanent,"" she wrote. ""To soaking up the imperfections and that the best thing you can do for your child is make them feel loved, safe and supported just like my mother did for me.

29,Shanghai COVID lockdown supply issues prompt Queensland to delay non-urgent elective procedures,health,"  Queensland hospitals have been forced to postpone some non-urgent elective procedures due to a worldwide shortage of contrast solutions required for a range of medical imaging. The iodinated contrast mediums are used in computerised tomography (CT) scans and other imaging, including angiography, used to diagnose and treat conditions such as blockages and abnormalities in blood vessels. Remaining stocks of the intravenous dyes were being kept for emergency procedures. A shortage of the products, marketed as Omnipaque and Visipaque, stems from COVID-19 lockdowns in Shanghai, China, where much of the world supply was made. Queensland Health Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Services executive director Kirstine Sketcher-Baker said the shortage was not expected to be resolved until the end of June at the earliest. ""It may take longer than this given the volatility of COVID-19 lockdowns in Shanghai,"" she said. ""Along with the federal government, we are also investigating other sourcing options and strategies to conserve stocks and seek other alternatives until this issue is resolved."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Ms Sketcher-Baker said Queensland Health was working with its hospitals to determine what impact the shortage was having on clinical services. ""For the time being, we will need to reschedule some non-urgent elective procedures that require medical imaging until we can replenish stocks,"" she said. ""This is unfortunate but unavoidable, as this product is essential for a number of procedures. ""We are hopeful of quickly resolving this issue with the supplier."" Affected patients will be contacted by their treating hospitals.

31,This pervasive furphy on Australia's emissions was repeated throughout the campaign,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Around the country, in what is shaping to be a tightly contested federal election, millions of Australians have already cast their vote, while millions more will head to polling booths tomorrow. For the past few months, both in the lead up to — and throughout — the official six-week campaign, Fact Check has examined claims from all sides of the political divide on the issues that matter most to voters. From climate change to a federal integrity commission, aged-care funding to debt and deficit: read on to learn what the politicians got wrong and what they got right, and for the facts. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Climate change loomed large for the Coalition in the 2022 campaign, with a slew of independent candidates challenging Liberal moderates in once safe inner-city seats on platforms that put emissions reduction and the transition to renewables front and centre. So it was hardly surprising that the Coalition should seek to cast its climate credentials in the most favourable light. In March, shortly before the beginning of the campaign, Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed: ""Australia is reducing its emissions by around 20 per cent."" Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia has reduced emissions by around 20 per cent, and that this is a better record than the US, NZ, Canada, Japan and many European countries. Is that correct? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. ""Australia has reduced its emissions by more than New Zealand, by more than Canada, by more than the United States, by more than Japan, by more than many countries in Europe,"" he added. The biggest problem with that claim? Although the 20 per cent figure aligned with data for 2020 from Australia's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, it was skewed by the effects of the pandemic, which saw emissions plunge temporarily worldwide. And at the time of the Prime Minister's misleading boast, other nations hadn't yet released their 2020 data, which did not allow for a fair comparison. Fact Check found Mr Morrison to be misleading when he made a similar claim in late 2021. Many countries submitted their 2020 figures to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in mid-April this year, but that didn't stop government ministers offering similar versions of the claim. Communications Minister Paul Fletcher repeated parts of Mr Morrison's claim on an episode of Q+A on May 12: ""Australia's emissions are already 20 per cent down on 2005 levels, so that's ahead of New Zealand, Canada and the US."" But the recently released data for the US showed a greater reduction than Australia's (on 2005 levels) of 20.9 per cent, including land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). And removing the LULUCF component, which is often controversial in carbon accounting, and changing the starting year to 1990, when the UNFCCC data begins, pushes Australia further down the rankings, leaving it above only New Zealand. Finally, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg included the OECD in his comparison with Australia in claims made on April 23 and May 16. By the time Mr Frydenberg made his claims, figures for 2020 were available for New Zealand, Canada and 32 of 38 OECD countries. Yet he persisted with 2019 figures for New Zealand (""4 per cent"") and Canada (""1 per cent"") and a 2018 figure for the OECD (""7 per cent""). Once again, the latest official figures showed his claims to be misleading. When comparing the same years, the 32 of 38 OECD countries for which data is available showed a 20.9 per cent decline in emissions on 2005 levels, including LULUCF. That the Coalition continued to repeat this claim in various guises in spite of evidence to the contrary made this campaign furphy one for the ages. Egregious and sometimes vote-changing scare campaigns — in which spurious claims are made about what the other side might do if elected — have long been a feature of Australian elections. This time was no different. Fact Check analysed the spread, origins and details of four such campaigns in a series of Election Scare Alerts. From humble beginnings, a campaign driven by Labor MPs has grown, implying the Coalition has a plan to expand the cashless debit card to age pensioners. Is there any evidence, or is it a scare campaign? From Labor, two claims dominated: a suggestion that a re-elected Morrison government would force all pensioners onto its controversial cashless welfare card program for which Fact Check could find no evidence, and a revamped ""Mediscare"" campaign incorrectly alleging, among other things, that the government had promised to ""scrap"" Medicare if re-elected for four elections in a row. From across the aisle, the Coalition's scare tactics revolved around taxes, with members of the government pushing unsubstantiated claims that Labor planned to introduce a ""sneaky carbon tax"" as well as a so-called ""death tax"". In debunking these claims, Fact Check and its partner organisation RMIT FactLab were able to provide crucial context. Since 2019, the Coalition has been running a campaign to convince you Labor will introduce a ""death tax"" if elected. But is there any evidence? However, the spread of misinformation was rife: in the case of Labor's cashless welfare card claims, Social Services Minister Anne Ruston was painted as the architect of an apparent plan to include all pensioners in the program. As the scare campaign took hold, memes featuring a fabricated quote attributed to Senator Ruston — debunked as part of RMIT FactLab's election monitoring project Mosaic — were shared widely online alongside unsubstantiated claims about an extension of the use of the card. Meanwhile, Coalition speculation that Labor would introduce death taxes if elected was reappropriated later in the campaign to discredit Labor's low-income housing policy, despite the policy not incorporating any semblance of a tax. Whether spruiking funding records or criticising spending decisions, the use of figures not adjusted for changes in inflation, the size of the economy or population growth has been a popular tactic during the campaign. Mr Frydenberg, for instance, claimed during his budget speech that the Coalition government had doubled aged-care funding (an issue important to voters, according to Google data analysed by FactLab). However, adjusting the latest figures for inflation and changes in the number of people accessing aged-care services showed government funding per aged-care resident per day was only 1.1 times larger than in 2014-15. In the same speech, Mr Frydenberg also suggested the number of Australians in trade apprenticeships was at a record level: a claim that didn't stack up when the growing population was considered. Adjusted for population, apprenticeship levels were higher under the last Labor government. Similarly, a claim from Labor Leader Anthony Albanese during his budget reply speech that the government had ""already doubled the debt before the pandemic"" was also found to be less than factual when the changing size of the economy was taken into account. Fact Check found that between June 2013, three months before the Coalition was elected, and June 2019, seven months before the pandemic, gross debt as a share of GDP grew by 65 per cent, and net debt by 85 per cent. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese says that debt and deficit in Australia have never been higher. RMIT ABC Fact Check takes a look at the history books. With Australia staring down the pandemic-induced economic crisis, the economy was a major focal point for the campaign, though the claims didn't always check out. According to Mr Albanese, for example, debt and deficit had ""never been higher"", a claim also touched on by United Australia Party chairman Clive Palmer, who said in a speech to the National Press Club that Australia faced debt ""unprecedented in the nation's history"". Historical data, however, showed far greater levels of both debt and deficit were recorded following World War II. In a similar vein, Mr Morrison also exaggerated economic troubles, claiming during the first leaders' debate that the pandemic recession was ""30 times worse than what occurred during the global financial crisis"". Experts, however, had previously told Fact Check that such a claim was misleading, confusing and probably wrong. Justifying a big-spending budget, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Parliament that coronavirus had ""raged through the developed world and is now raging through the developing world"" in a far more devastating way than the global financial crisis. Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers, on the other hand, was found by Fact Check to be correct when he said the current government had ""taxed more, borrowed more and spent more than the last Labor government"". Looking forward, meanwhile, Mr Palmer (who hopes to become Australia's next treasurer in the event his party forms government) also used his Press Club address to announce a plan to cap rising home loan interest rates at 3 per cent. But as FactLab found, the plan was not exactly foolproof. Experts contacted by FactLab variously described it as ""nutty"", ""incredibly naive"", ""off the planet"", ""crazy, crazy"", ""a brain explosion"" and more. Yet another campaign hot topic has been the issue of a federal integrity commission, with claims about how such a commission would operate resurfacing during each of the three leaders' debates. In the first debate, for example, Mr Albanese said the Morrison Government's proposed model ""would have ministers determine whether they can be investigated or not"", while during the second debate he claimed the cabinet would need to ""decide whether there can be an investigation"". As Fact Check explained, the government's proposed integrity commission would have two arms: a law enforcement integrity commission and a public sector integrity commission. In relation to Mr Albanese's criticisms, there are key differences between the divisions when it comes to how referrals would be made and whether public hearings could occur. Under the government's plan, referrals in the public division could only be made by certain individuals including the Attorney-General, the responsible minister for the agency investigated, Commonwealth Integrity Office Holders and certain parliamentarians. Investigations in the law enforcement division could be referred by anyone — including members of the public. Mr Morrison, meanwhile, suggested during the third debate that the government's proposed integrity commission would have the ""powers of a royal commission"", including ""powers of search"" and ""powers compelling witnesses"". The third leaders' debate was a much more subdued affair than the fiery, more shouty previous clash between the two leaders. But in politics, less shouting doesn't necessarily mean fewer furphies. While the new body would have some powers comparable to those of a royal commission — including powers to enter and search premises and compel witnesses to testify, as suggested by Mr Morrison — there are other significant differences between the two. Fact Check explained that the Royal Commissions Act was succinct, leaving scope for commissioners to use their powers broadly. In contrast, the much longer draft bill to establish the Commonwealth Integrity Commission imposed many constraints, including how investigations could be initiated and carried out. This distinction undermines Mr Morrison's boast in all three debates that the government's draft bill is ""347 pages of legislation"". As for Mr Morrison's claim that his government's failure to legislate a national integrity commission did not amount to a broken election promise, evidence suggested otherwise. Shadow Defence Minister Brendan O'Connor says the Howard and Rudd-Gillard governments both spend 1.7 to 1.8 per cent of GDP on defence. RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. Away from the campaign's big issues, numerous claims made by politicians from all sides were put under Fact Check's microscope. On the economic progress of women in Australia, both Mr Morrison and Mr Albanese were found by Fact Check to have made claims lacking vital context. When it came to defence spending, Shadow Defence Minister Brendan O'Connor's claim that the current level of funding was similar to that which occurred under the Rudd-Gillard government was a fair call. There was more to the story, however, in relation to Shadow Foreign Minister Penny Wong's suggestion that annual aid to Solomon Islands had been cut by 28 per cent compared to Labor's time in office. Housing Minister Michael Sukkar says the Coalition is responsible for getting the level of first home buyers to its highest in 15 years. RMIT ABC Fact Check runs the numbers. Meanwhile, a claim made by Housing Minister Michael Sukkar that the number of first home buyers was at its highest level in ""nearly 15 years"", was overstated. Moving away from Labor and the Coalition, Greens leader Adam Bandt's claim that the fossil fuel industry received $10 billion in federal government subsidies each year was judged to be overblown, while Indi independent Helen Haines was found to be exaggerating when she said the Morrison government had gagged debate in parliament more than ""any other government in history"". As RMIT ABC Fact Check was busy holding politicians to account, its partner organisation, RMIT FactLab, worked to ensure online misinformation was nipped in the bud. As part of Mosaic, an election-monitoring project funded by the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas, FactLab worked with a team of international researchers from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue to track and trace online misinformation narratives during the campaign. Among investigations undertaken as part of Mosaic, FactLab examined the forces behind the conservative lobby group Advance Australia, their ties to government minister Zed Seselja and their efforts to undermine the campaign of independent ACT Senate candidate David Pocock. The team also looked closely at the hotly contested Melbourne electorates of Goldstein and Kooyong, where independent candidates Zoe Daniel and Monique Ryan are threatening to unseat the sitting Liberal members. FactLab has also worked in partnership with Meta to debunk misleading claims made on its sites Facebook and Instagram. Among them were incorrect suggestions that the Australian electoral process does not guard against voter fraud as well as misleading assertions about the funding election candidates are entitled to receive.

32,Millions in JobKeeper went to private schools that grew their surpluses,health,"  Most private schools that took JobKeeper increased their income during the first year of the pandemic, including some of Australia's most exclusive schools. For the first time, the ABC can reveal all 395 non-government schools that reported claiming JobKeeper in 2020 and the amounts they received. The ABC has also analysed the incomes and surpluses of these schools, which reported accessing $769 million in wage support. With taxpayers subsidising pay packets, together these schools more than doubled their surplus in 2020 to almost $1 billion. ""The taxpayer does not need to be subsidising schools that have more money than they know what to do with,"" said investment analyst Dean Paatsch, who has been monitoring the subsidy program. ""JobKeeper topped up their [surpluses] and increased their cash,"" he said. ""They could renovate their boat shed, finish their indoor pools … upgrade their gymnasium and wellness centre — all of those things occurred."" The $89 billion JobKeeper program is estimated to have saved more than 700,000 jobs but has been dogged by questions about the efficiency of that huge spend. Most employers, including private schools, qualified for the subsidy based on a real or projected downturn of 30 per cent in the early months of 2020. The 395 non-government schools that claimed JobKeeper represent a little over 10 per cent of the sector. But 235 of these schools later told the Federal Education Department their incomes had actually increased in 2020 — even without JobKeeper. For schools where incomes were up, they reported receiving at least $315 million in JobKeeper. One hundred and fifty-six schools reported a downturn in recurrent income for 2020, including six that fell by more than 30 per cent, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office. Organisations that qualified during the initial phase of JobKeeper collected $1,500 a fortnight per eligible employee for up to six months — regardless of their later turnover. ""JobKeeper's fatal flaw was that you qualified in an instant, based on a downturn that could have been simply a forecast or temporary,"" Mr Paatsch said. ""[And] it never included a clawback mechanism. ""They could easily have afforded to return it."" Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg previously defended allowing employers to qualify based on projections, and not forcing companies to repay JobKeeper they did not need. ""If we didn't do that … we wouldn't have got the money out the door,"" he told 7.30 last September. ""If they were going to have to pay back that money, then they would haven't necessarily taken it in the first place, and you would have seen jobs being lost."" Mr Frydenberg was unavailable for an interview for this story, but in a statement defended his scheme as ""one of the most successful economic support programs in Australia's history"". Some high-profile institutions that claimed JobKeeper include: The ABC has also analysed the schools' financial filings with the charities regulator, which show JobKeeper schools increasing their surpluses from around $350 million in 2019 to at least $884 million. There is no suggestion that any schools that claimed JobKeeper did anything wrong. Independent Schools Australia, which represents more than 1,000 schools, said its members ""rely heavily on fees paid by parents — many of whom lost jobs or income due to the impacts of COVID-19”. ""JobKeeper has helped save the jobs of teachers and other staff at many independent schools across Australia,"" a spokeswoman said. Revenue among schools that collected JobKeeper in 2020 fell overall by around 1 per cent across the year. ""Teachers weren't stood down [and] school fees continued to be paid by parents,"" Mr Paatsch said. ""JobKeeper in those circumstances makes their labour cheaper, and their [surpluses] increase, and this is what we saw,"" he said. Independent Schools Australia said most boarding schools that qualified for JobKeeper did lose revenue ""when international, regional and interstate students were forced to stay home due to border and health restrictions"". ""Boarding schools do not receive recurrent funding from government to cover the costs of boarding houses,"" a spokeswoman said. Headmaster of The King’s School, Tony George, said support was required at the time, particularly for schools, like his, with boarding students. ""The pandemic presented profound challenges for all schools as they worked to meet the government requirement to remain open, educate Australian children and keep teachers employed,"" he said. ""While government schools continued to be funded directly, the only support available to non-government schools that experienced a loss of income was through the Federal Government’s JobKeeper program. ""Unfortunately, most non-government schools were unable to satisfy the strict eligibility requirements."" Schools provided the income and JobKeeper data to the Education Department, which later provided it to the independent Parliamentary Budget Office, which collated it on behalf of Federal Labor MP Andrew Leigh.

33,'A new standard': How this music festival changed to become more inclusive,health,"  The NT's largest music festival Bass in the Grass improves access for people living with disabilities Darwin's largest music festival, Bass in the Grass, normally draws thousands of tourists to the Top End and this year, Jim Simpson and Jeff McCourt are ready to party. The Northern Territory's largest music festival is making it easier for people with a disability to attend Disability organisations say more work is needed to ensure people of all abilities can access major events Access Arts Australia is working on a minimum code of conduct for events Both men live with cerebral palsy and use wheelchairs. ""This one could be really good … to see the music, to see the festival, to see everything,"" Mr McCourt said. The festival is taking place on Saturday and this year, organisers have made a series of adjustments to accommodate people of all abilities. Changes include shaded viewing platforms in front of stages, an accessible entry lane for ticket holders, free entry for carers and pro-floor matting, which makes it easier for people using wheelchairs to move around. Mr McCourt said it was important for people like him to also enjoy music and other events. ""[It was difficult to attend] some events like the super cars, so it's good [to have these adjustments,"" he said. Mr Simpson went to the event last year and took advantage of the viewing platforms, which allowed him to have an unimpeded view of performers. Using non-verbal communication and with the support of an independent living coach he provided a statement. ""I'm excited about going to the festival and dancing on the viewing platform,"" he said. As for the thing he's most excited about for the Saturday event, Mr McCourt had a surprising answer. ""The food!"" The festival's improved access changes have prompted access advocacy groups to demand more from major events. Annie Rily from disability support organisation, Carpentaria, said the festival's adjustments showed it was possible for festivals to be more inclusive. ""Bass in the Grass is setting a new standard this year and we want to see this continue,"" she said. ""We've got 20,000 people in the Territory that have a disability and we want to ensure that they can fully participate in events,"" she said. The issue extends beyond the Territory's borders; Access Arts Australia CEO Matthew Hall said despite good will, many events were falling short. ""Most music festivals [don't do enough] in terms of accessible toilets and viewing platforms and ramps and quiet zones,"" he said. Ability Fest, which was co-founded by Australian of The Year Dylan Alcott, is regularly pointed to as the blueprint for other major events to follow. Consultation is currently underway to create a minimum code of conduct, which Access Arts Australia hopes will be completed next year. Access2Arts Chief Executive Officer, Rebecca Young, hopes the code will provide organisations with a guide on how they can plan events. However, she said it would also act as a means of holding them to account, if they don't sign up. ""There are the best of intentions out there in the marketplace and across a lot of different arts organisations and festivals, but people not knowing where to start is often the first barrier,"" she said.

34,Veterans feel 'forgotten' and 'left out' in 2022 federal election campaign,health,"  Afghanistan veteran Matt Hull says the ""hardest thing"" about being out of the military is simply adapting to life as a civilian again. ""You don't have to shave every day, you don't have to do a million push ups just to prove yourself,"" he said. ""You can feel a bit lost. ""I got through that period, unfortunately there's quite a few veterans who didn't."" One day out from the federal election, Mr Hull – as well as fellow Darwin-based veterans Sam Snell and Hannah Taino-Spick – say ex-servicemen and woman across the Northern Territory have been feeling ""forgotten"" and ""left out"" throughout the campaign. Ms Taino-Spick, a former Royal Australian Air Force member and current Charles Darwin University lecturer, wants political hopefuls to commit ""in principle"" to adopting all future recommendations from the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. ""Without strong commitment from any government on recommendations from the veteran suicide commission, then it will cost more lives,"" Ms Taino-Spick said. ""The lack of commitment from this year's frenzied election campaign, speaks volumes how major parties and their leaders feel about the nations veterans and their families: nothing."" Ms Taino-Spick said improving the mental health of veterans across Australia should have been a key election issue. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog In April, the final report date for the Royal Commission was extended by a year. It's now expected to be handed down on June 17, 2024. Ms Snell, who served in the Royal Australian Navy from 2008 to 2015, is hopeful that the Royal Commission will lead to better supports for veterans and current serving members. ""The recommendations which come out of the Royal Commission will be critical, and they will be scrutinised,"" she said. ""I would like to hope that any party that gets in will do everything they can to implement all of those recommendations."" The Coalition, Australian Labor Party and The Greens were asked if they would commit to implementing the recommendations from the Royal Commission. A Labor spokesman said the party wasn't ""going to pre-empt the recommendations of the Royal Commission"" but would ""carefully consider all of them when they are released"". Senator Jordon Steele-John, The Greens spokesperson for Veteran's Affairs, said the party had already committed to establishing a redress scheme for personnel ""who have experienced violence and abuse through defence institutions during their time of service"" in anticipation of the recommendations being handed down. The Coalition didn't respond directly to the question. Mr Hull is calling on whichever party wins the election tomorrow to work closely with retired and serving personnel throughout the Royal Commission process. ""This is not a time to finger point,"" he said. ""This isn't about division; it's about coming together. ""Whoever wins on the weekend, just make sure that when it's all said and done, after it's all over, I hope that both sides can shake hands with each other and have a beer. ""We're about bringing everyone together and that includes the veteran community."" Darwin was recently added as an official location for a public hearing, a move which Ms Taino-Spick welcomed. However, Ms Taino-Spick said more should and could be done to publicly advertise the addition of the Top End military town. Darwin's public hearing is scheduled for October 17, 2022.

35,Most teens in this town know someone lost to suicide. Here’s what they want the politicians to know,health,"  'I've lost too many friends to suicide' In Shepparton, a youth mental crisis has been brewing for years. As politicians spruik their plans to combat the issue, teens in town have their own ideas about what needs to change. How much bullying does it take for a 13-year-old to no longer want to live? Nattaya can tell you. There was a time, not so long ago, when that's exactly what she wanted. WARNING: This article discusses suicide and self-harm. Where bullying, harassment, and ""nasty, threatening words"" used to be left at the school gates, they followed Nattaya home. Social media acted as an open doorway, allowing the ordeal to creep insidiously into every aspect of her life. Without reprieve, the taunts soon started to change how she saw herself and her place in the world. She started to believe she wasn't wanted. To cope, she tried to make herself invisible. Even to family and friends. Then she tried to take her own life. ""It got to the point that I just wanted to give up on everything,"" she says. It's been a long road of counselling and confidence-building to get Nattaya where she is today: a resilient 15-year-old who loves her cat and guinea pigs, sings her ""heart out"", and wants to become a disability support worker. But she's regularly reminded of just how close the danger is when news spreads of another friend who has lost their battle with mental illness. Losing someone to suicide is shattering at any age, but even more so in plural all before you're legally allowed to drive a car. ""Too many young people take their own lives because of bullying,"" Nattaya says. ""I've lost too many friends to suicide and I'm 15. I want other people to know if you are ever getting bullied don't be afraid to open up."" The youth mental health crisis in Shepparton, a regional centre of 51,000 people two hours out from Melbourne, where Nattaya has spent her entire life, has been brewing for years. And like in towns and cities across Australia, it's been exacerbated by the social disruption and anxiety brought on by years of on-again, off-again lockdowns. Over recent months, a number of suicides among young people has left local families especially on edge. Earlier this year, the state Member for Shepparton, independent Suzanna Sheed, spoke about a message she received from a young woman from the region, detailing a ""tragic picture of the situation"" where young people were waiting up to six months to access mental health support. This week, she says the shortages in mental health support are just one part of a ""health crisis situation"" related to workforce issues and accessibility. ""Regional areas are always underdone compared to metropolitan areas,"" she says. At an acute level, there are no inpatient facilities for children and adolescents who are at risk of suicide in town, with the closest option more than two hours away in Melbourne's Box Hill. But even if you can travel, the lack of available beds and staff to manage them is an ongoing issue. For the local headspace, a mental health organisation open to people between 12 and 25 years old, this means making tough decisions. The organisation is supposed to target early intervention and primary prevention, but this has been stymied by the need to direct resources to more complex referrals. ""We can't ignore the referrals that come in,"" says Robyn Hucker, the manager of Shepparton's headspace centre and a lifelong resident of regional Victoria. ""The reality is there's nowhere else for them to go; they can't afford private practitioners, other services aren't specifically catering to mental health therapy, and we know young people can't get into GPs."" Prioritising more serious cases, however, comes with a heavy trade-off. ""The longer we see somebody, the less people we can see. It's a constant see-saw,"" she says. Nattaya is just one of the young people impacted by these hard decisions. In 2020, during her first year of high school, she reached out to headspace when the bullying started. It wasn't until the following year that she was able to get a session. ""It helped a lot,"" she says. Finding an online community called Mayhem Crew — a group of people from across the world dedicated to supporting each other through mental health challenges and spreading positivity — has also played a big part in changing her outlook. This is part of what prompted Nattaya to share her story, so other young people know they're not alone while waiting for professional help. And when she sees her friends post stories on social media, saying that they're ""over life"" or ""can't do this anymore"", she'll often get in touch and try to fill the gap. ""I write them back and ask 'what's wrong, what's happening?',"" she says. ""But I don't say 'I've been through that' because no one ever goes through the same thing, only something similar and they know the feeling of what it's like. ""I tell them that I'm always here for them, and that life is never easy, it's always going to have struggles and tough times, but you're strong and you can get through this."" It's a grim reality that suicide is the leading cause of death for young Australians. This is especially true for Indigenous youth, those that are LGBTIQ+, and young people living in regional, rural and remote areas, who are all more likely to take their own lives. The pandemic provided an opportunity to bring the issue back into the spotlight, and in the lead up to Saturday's federal election both major parties have made mental health announcements. On the NSW North Coast everyone knows each other. And everyone seems to know someone. Someone who has lost a loved one to suicide; someone who has become acquainted with the black dog. Scott Morrison last week announced $55 million in investment into mental health and suicide prevention and support, targeting ""the missing middle"" services across Tasmania. Another $873 million has been promised to the national headspace network over the next four years ""to address demand and reduce wait times"". Perhaps ironically, however, the Coalition's focus on the issue of trans kids in sport, via their candidate for Warringah Katherine Deves, led to a spike in calls to the national LGBTIQ+ helpline QLife earlier in the campaign. Labor has said it would honour the government's March budget promise to boost mental health and suicide prevention spending by an additional $650 million and has also promised to reverse a funding cut for bulk-billed telehealth psychiatry sessions for people in regional and rural areas to a cost of $31 million over the forward estimates. While the teenagers of Shepparton won't be able to vote in this weekend's election, they're unequivocal that more needs to be done to support young people grappling with mental illness. Maxwell has just turned 18 and can now say they have ""so much to live for"". But it wasn't always that way. Asked about when their battle with anxiety and depression began, they say it's been part of their life for as long as they can remember. ""It's been a very difficult track, a very difficult journey, but it's gotten better lately,"" they say. ""I was very suicidal for a very long time, I didn't think that there was much of a future for me, but some of the stuff that's been happening lately has been really good, that I'm sitting back and going, OK maybe I have something to live for now."" An important part of Maxwell's mental health journey has been support from their mother, who works as a psychologist and quickly noticed when their mental health was going downhill. ""She was the one who got me into therapy, she was the one who got me into using my art as therapy,"" they say. ""She was never like, 'oh it's your fault that you feel like this', which is something that I really needed to hear because at that point my mental health was mostly around the fact that I felt like shit but didn't understand why."" And like every young person we speak to in Shepparton, it's something they've seen their friends grapple with too. ""My mum dubbed me 'damage control', because I was always happy to bandage people up and give quick little pep talks,"" they say. Quickly word spread, and soon people outside their friendship circle were reaching out for support. ""It got to the point where I was going to school and people I didn't know were coming up to me, going 'hey, so, I'm feeling a little bit not the best, what should I do about it?'"" ""My instant reaction was this is someone that I've got to help."" ""Even people that were bullying me, it got to the point that I was talking to them about things. ""I was like, I don't care about what you did to me, if this helps you from, later down the line, hurting yourself and taking your life that means something to me."" While Maxwell says they are always happy to listen — so much so they are now studying at TAFE to become a social worker — they are frustrated that there's not more professional support out there for people who need it. ""The services around this town are just really not good enough,"" they say. ""As soon as you go as a new patient to headspace, you're on like a six-week waitlist to get an appointment, and if you miss one of those appointments, there are another six weeks that you have to wait — and some people really don't have that kind of time to wait."" ""It just kind of sucks because there are so many people around here that need that kind of help, and they either can't afford it, can't get in, or can't bring themselves to realise they actually need help."" Robyn Hucker from headspace acknowledges that services in Shepparton are stretched, both in her office and the private sector. ""We know the private sector is far outstripped in our community, it's just not enough, and generally too costly for the bulk of our population to be viable for our practitioners,"" she says. ""Demand has always been on the rise, there are just some unique challenges we're seeing at the moment."" Demand at the Shepparton centre is roughly about 15 per cent higher than the national headspace average and Robyn says the so-called COVID spike is just beginning now. There are a few reasons for this, but most simply she believes that during the pandemic people became disengaged with services — they got the ""can't be bothereds"". Now, as things open back up, and they settle into school for the year, they're starting to return. Robyn doesn't like the ""W word"" — waitlists — and while she would prefer everyone could get help as soon as they need it, she adds: ""We also can't pretend that we can see everyone"". ""It's still not disproportionate in terms of other specialist services, in fact, it might be a lot shorter, but does it meet the needs of what a young person might need then and there? No."" In the interim, headspace provides links to other services, including online resources and phone counselling. Families and young people are also urged to get in touch if something changes and support is needed urgently. ""But what the community sees, and what the young person sees, is that nobody helps,"" she says. Ask the teenagers what needs to change to reverse the crisis and they quickly rattle off a number of places to start. The first is ensuring there are more resources so people can get professional help as soon as the problem arises. The second is making sure those working at the services are well trained in dealing with teenagers — and what they need to hear at that moment. ""Self-harm and suicidal thoughts happen a lot, but turning around and saying it's  'normal' is not going to help anyone,"" Maxwell says. ""If someone loses their leg and they're bleeding out, being like 'bleeding out is normal' — that's not going to help them. You walk over there and go 'are you OK' and you bandage them up and tell them we can get through this together, I will help you. ""That's the kind of stuff you need, not the 'it's OK, it's fine, it's understandable that you're doing this'."" Felix, another 15-year-old high school student in Shepparton, describes his mental health ""as quite the rollercoaster"". ""I have a very up and down relationship with myself,"" he says, which has led him to see a counsellor for many years. But he's also witnessed what happens when people are left to go it alone. ""There's a lot of people who just aren't quite reached [by mental health services], whether that's in time or at all,"" he says. ""You get the whole 'yeah we can get you an appointment in three months times', and it's like yes, but I need help now. ""Obviously you can't click your fingers and that's fixed, because there's only so many people that can help, but if we just put some more time and money aside to help people."" The next positive change, according to Felix, would be ensuring that if services are available, they're able to dedicate enough time to actually working through the issues. As he puts it, you can't be expected to open up right away when you're ""talking to a stranger"". For every death by suicide, as many as 30 others attempt to end their life. Australia has a suicide problem — it seems we can all agree on that — but when it comes to solutions, the verdict isn't so clear. Nattaya would like to see more dedicated mental health support in schools. This means having someone at school who students are able to talk to about mental health and who ""could maybe come sit in the class with you for a session or two, and they can help you do your work while talking about what's going on"". But overall, according to Felix, it all comes back to one thing: a lot of people going through mental illness ""feel like no one gets it"". ""It's a very isolating feeling,"" he says. ""But if we did educate people more, and give them the correct information, it would be a lot less isolating — because you could look around and see that you're not the only person struggling with this.""

36,Australia's COVID-19 infection rate led the world last week — so why aren't our politicians talking about it?,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes In the shadow of a once-in-a-generation pandemic, you might have thought health would be one of the key issues dominating the campaign trail. But you'd be wrong. This is despite a prediction that more than half a million Australians could be left with a debilitating illness because of COVID-19, that thousands of children are falling behind because of the pandemic and that Australia has a hospital workforce ""in crisis"". We've had announcements from Labor and the Coalition on reducing the price of medicines, some action on rural and regional health from the Coalition and a focus on primary care from Labor. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog But what we haven't heard is how the next government is going to tackle some of the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Neither party has released a detailed, standalone plan on how it will manage the pandemic in the future, including future vaccine supply, securing and distributing adequate antiviral medications and how to tackle emerging variants — which seem to be appearing every six months. Why are we seeing more of these new sub-variants? Is the virus mutating faster? And what are the implications for the future of COVID? With strict lockdowns still fresh in the minds of many Australians, public health experts say it's like COVID-19 is a dirty word that politicians are fearful of addressing. This is despite the fact that so many Australians are still living day-to-day with the impact of the virus. The country's moving average is now at 45 deaths a day — the highest it has been since February. And last week Australia's per-capita infection rate led the world. COVID-19 infections in Australia hit worldwide highs — and experts predict another Omicron variant spike is coming Neither party has outlined how it will tackle the growing number of Australians who continue to suffer debilitating effects of the virus with long COVID-19. The World Health Organisation defines long COVID as a post COVID-19 condition in someone with a history of COVID-19 infection, with symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction for at least two months, that can't be explained by an alternative diagnosis. While some states and territories have set up long COVID clinics in public hospitals, these are already flooded with people trying to get help. There's no national action plan for a coordinated approach to tackling long COVID. And no plan to tackle post-viral illnesses such as evidence-based treatment pathways, Medicare funding for access to medical and allied health support or widespread general practitioner education. Estimates vary on how significant a public health issue long COVID could be for the next government. There's conservative estimates that 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients will develop long COVID, with official figures showing 6.4 million positive cases in Australia. That means roughly more than half-a-million people will need ongoing medical support for a post-viral illness where currently almost none exists. Australian Medical Association president Dr Omar Khorsid said there was no way a few hospital clinics would be able to manage demand for services and that GPs needed to be upskilled to diagnose and manage long COVID. ""We need the system to provide services, and the next government won't be able to ignore long COVID"" he said. According to Dr Khorsid, it is something that needs to be at the top of the new Health Minister's to-do list. While children and young people have remained fairly free of significant illness from COVID-19, it's clear many are falling behind in other ways as a result of the pandemic. In fact, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians is so concerned, it is calling for an urgent ""national recovery plan to help the nation's children catch up from the setbacks of the COVID-19 pandemic"".' RACP President and paediatrician Dr Jacqueline Small said she had seen the impact of the last two years on children coming to her clinic. ""As a developmental paediatrician, I see this in my work every day,"" she said. ""Children have faced so many challenges and hurdles for over two years and some of those impacts are yet to be realised."" Public health experts say what's needed is a clear commitment from the next government to adopt a range of comprehensive measures to address children's health, starting by agreeing to fund and implement the National Children's Mental health and wellbeing strategy. A new strategy by the federal government is hoping to cut down lengthy wait times and reduce out-of-pocket costs for professional help for children with mental health issues. This is a preventative, integrated, whole-of-community approach to support the mental health and wellbeing of children aged 0−12 and their families, compiled by Australia's leading child mental health experts. The strategy was released in October 2021, but so far in the election campaign there's been no clear commitment from either party to fully fund and implement the recommendations. Dr Small said a chief paediatrician should be appointed and a task force set up to address the challenges children were facing. ""The impacts, and how these will be compounded, are deeply concerning if they are not thoroughly examined and addressed at a national level across all sectors,"" she said. A perfect storm is brewing in our public hospitals with a burnt out workforce, a growing flu and COVID-19 caseload coupled with an elective surgery backlog — all of which is putting unprecedented pressure on public hospital staff across Australia. Australian Medical Association President Dr Omar Khorshid said hospital staff were trying their best with limited resources, but it was particularly challenging for those on the front line in emergency departments. ""They don't have a system with enough capacity to meet demand — it's as simple as that,"" he said. ""What's happened is that the bean counters, the politicians, have just underestimated the extent of the demand for health care in our country."" He said lockdowns meant many people deferred getting medical care, even when many of them really needed it. That meant patients were now coming to hospitals sicker than usual with many more requiring admission to hospital. ""When you add all this up, you have a workforce which is really struggling and the most worrying thing is that people really can't see a way out,"" he said. ""We are hearing emergency department staff talking about the moral injury of not being able to look after patients the way they know they should, and what that does to you as an individual, as a practitioner."" The AMA has called on the next government to boost the funding split from the current 45 per cent the federal government contributes to an even 50-50 with the states and territories. So far, the Coalition has ruled that out, saying when its funding for mental health is added to its contribution to the states, it exceeds 50 per cent. Labor has pledged to sit down with the states and territories to discuss the issue, if it wins on Saturday. Health experts say bumping up the funding commitment would be a good first step by any incoming government and would go some way to reduce the pressure state and territory hospitals are under in trying to deliver quality care in a resource-poor environment. But so would a recognition that the pandemic has changed people's healthcare needs in a way we haven't experienced before.

37,Their votes won't change who wins this election. So how do people in safe seats make their voices heard?,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes In the heat of the election campaign, the spotlight is firmly fixed on the marginal seats, where just a few hundred votes could decide the next prime minister. But as millions of Australians prepare to go to the polls tomorrow, some voters living in safe seats feel overlooked by politicians in their local electorates. ""Definitely they don't care,"" said Munish Bansal, with a laugh. Mr Bansal, who is caring full-time for his elderly parents who migrated from India, lives in the seat of Scullin in Melbourne's north. It is Labor's safest seat, held by Shadow Multicultural Affairs Minister Andrew Giles with a margin of more than 21 per cent. Mr Bansal said he heard of politicians in more marginal areas door-knocking or ringing voters to ask about what mattered to them. ""Nobody comes to my home … I never see any activity here,"" he said. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. Anna Duncombe lives in the rural Queensland town of Kingaroy in the seat of Maranoa — the safest seat in the country. It is held by the Liberal National Party's David Littleproud, the Coalition's Minister for Agriculture, with a margin of more than 25 per cent. ""Really, my vote will make no [difference to the] result in the election,"" Ms Duncombe said. ""One good thing, I suppose, is we don't see many politicians. ""It's so safe that the odds of us becoming a swing seat, I think, are nil."" Wiradjuri man Craig Taylor, who is chair of the Albury Wodonga Aboriginal Health Service, lives in the safe Liberal seat of Farrer, which Environment Minister Sussan Ley holds with a margin of more than 19 per cent. ""We only ever see a politician when they want a photo opportunity,"" Mr Taylor said. He has campaigned for Labor in the past but describes himself as a swinging voter between Labor, Greens or a quality independent. ""We just don't get enough coverage. And it's because it's not a marginal seat."" For Vivian Lai-Tran, a law student who lives in Labor-held Gorton in Melbourne's west, living in a safe seat can lead to disillusionment. ""Sometimes I don't feel like I'm really being represented,"" she said. ""I don't think there's much change that's happening because we are a safe seat, there's no real incentive or motivation for it. ""I've got friends who often speak of underinvestment in our safe seats, like taking for granted working-class families."" With almost one in five people in the electorate having Chinese ancestry, that subset of the community could have a big say in who wins the seat of Chisholm. But not all safe seats stay safe forever. For example, former prime minister John Howard lost his seat of Bennelong in the 2007 election. Two of the safest seats in the country right now do not belong to the major parties. The Tasmanian seat of Clark is held by independent Andrew Wilkie with a margin of 22 per cent, while Melbourne is held by Greens leader Adam Bandt with a similar margin. Both won their seats from Labor in 2010. For Rajan Venkataraman, who lives in Clark, avoiding the flurry of funding announcements and political fanfare wasn't a bad thing. ""The vote counts, wherever you are,"" he said. ""I guess we don't get high-profile visits from the party leaders, or certainly not as much as some other electorates including here in Tasmania. ""We don't get the spending commitments here that the more marginal seats receive … but from my perspective, that's not something that I complain about. ""I actually find the sort of spectacle of those funding promises one of the more distasteful aspects of elections."" Ms Duncombe echoed a key concern for much of the country — the lack of general practitioners in rural and remote areas. ""I've had three different GPs in the last 15 months, or three who've come and gone — I'm now on my fourth,"" she said. That made it difficult, she said, to build a rapport with a doctor and keep on top of her health, and she hoped more incentives would be offered to keep GPs in the area. She said while she was pleased that the local hospital in Kingaroy had had a recent upgrade, some health issues had to be treated further afield, which could put strain on the patient and their family. ""If there's anything serious, we have to go to Toowoomba,"" she said. Health was also a key concern for Mr Taylor in NSW, who said governments needed to prioritise sustainable funding for Indigenous health programs over the long term — up to 10 years rather than in three- or four-year cycles — if they wanted to see generational change. A key issue for Mr Bansal was that he was unable to access the carer payment via Centrelink because, he said, his wife's salary alone put their joint income above the threshold, despite him not earning an income himself. ""I'm just looking after my parents … the trouble is both can't speak English, they can't drive, so they need more care,"" he said. Mr Venkataraman, a business consultant who previously worked as a public servant, including in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said many of the concerns in his electorate were common across Australia — issues like employment, post-COVID recovery and climate change. But a priority for him was whether the major parties had asked enough questions about Australia's involvement in Afghanistan — was it for the right reasons, and was the country better or worse off after 20 years? ""Both political parties were involved in that war during their respective terms and government, but there does not seem to have been any questioning of the parties or any accountability,"" he said. ""There's definitely a community of Afghan refugees here [in Clark], including from the Hazara minority group … and I know there is a lot of anxiety among that community for family members and friends who still remain in Afghanistan."" Another key issue for him was the lack of gender and cultural diversity in the major parties' leadership, especially when so many Australians had migrated here from Asia, Africa and South America. ""Yet we see almost none of those faces or cultural backgrounds represented in the leadership positions in our parties."" ""Whoever wins, Australia will once again be led by a white man,"" he said. Ms Lai-Tran said it was ""infuriating"" when parties overlooked a local candidate from the community, such as Tu Le in the Western Sydney seat of Fowler. Ms Lai-Tran added she felt many issues important to young people and her community weren't being discussed, such as extending mental health care, social services and public housing. Jill Sheppard, from the ANU School of Politics and International Relations, said those in safe seats were not bombarded with political posters and handshakes. ""The vast majority of resources in an election campaign go towards marginal seats. And so in a safe seat, it can be blissful — you don't always know that there's an election happening,"" she said. ""Now that obviously has very serious implications in an era where there are increased attempts at vote-buying."" Dr Sheppard, who lives in the safe Labor seat of Canberra, said it could be challenging for constituents to make their voices heard. ""Our parties are so disciplined — local members are so reluctant to actually go against the grain of their party leadership — it can be hard to get local issues put on the national agenda,"" she said, although she added some issues were better dealt with at a state or local level. Some voters told the ABC they hoped to make a statement with their Senate vote come election day, while others said they could approach their local members to raise the issues they cared about directly. Ms Lai-Tran said she tried to make a difference not through politics but by volunteering at community legal centres. ""My politics is very much informed by what's really happening — how does it actually impact people? How do these policies support our community or not support our community?"" she said. In Farrer, Mr Taylor said he didn't think it was impossible the seat could change hands, saying he saw a glimmer of hope just across the border. ""One day, it will change. And we saw that change when Cathy McGowan won the seat of Indi,"" he said. Mr Littleproud told the ABC he secured more than $6.9 billion for the electorate for roads, improvements to aged care services and other projects. ""I've never taken being the Member for Maranoa for granted,"" he said. ""I know my communities and if they're not happy — they let me know and we sort it out."" He also pointed to $17 million in funding for Heart of Australia — a mobile medical program for rural and remote Queensland. ""To attract the workforce we need, we're cutting HECS debts for doctors and nurses who chose to work in the regions,"" he said. There were benefits to living in a safe seat, he said, as having ""a seat at the table"" ensured the electorate could get its ""fair share"". ""Being in a Coalition and in government is the only way we see anything like the investment we do in Maranoa,"" he said. Mr O'Connor, the member for Gorton, said many in his electorate were struggling with cost-of-living pressures. He said Labor had committed $10 million to upgrade the Western Highway and also had policies to strengthen Medicare and make child care cheaper. ""What we are learning this election is no seat is safe, electorates can't be taken for granted, and every vote counts,"" he said. He added some seats that were previously thought of as ""safe"" were under threat from those wanting effective representation on issues such as climate change and anti-corruption. As the Shadow Defence Minister, he said the government had ""failed to show leadership in its response to the Brereton war crimes report"". He said Labor supported the creation of the Office of the Special Investigator but added that complex legal processes were underway and needed to be resolved ""unhindered by political commentary"". Mr Wilkie said he had been able to secure $1.5 billion of additional funding for his electorate, and said independents can enjoy ""disproportionate influence"" because a major party might need their support. ""The dynamic is different because a safe seat held by a major party is often ignored by all parties, but the major parties are always interested in seats held by independents, if only because they hold out hope of reclaiming them,"" he said. ""It's entirely understandable that marginal seats with all their pork-barrelling receive disproportionate media attention. ""But the fact that my vote has increased every election is hard evidence that the community is not fooled by pork-barrelling and instead craves a good local member who effectively represents and helps the community."" He added he had repeatedly raised the Afghanistan issue, especially the obligation to lift Australia's humanitarian intake of Afghan refugees and increase foreign aid. A spokesperson for Ms Ley said she had been able to commit half a billion dollars for projects in her electorate since the last election, and that Farrer benefits from ongoing support from the Coalition government. ""This will be Sussan’s eighth election. The seat wasn’t safe in 2001,"" they said. ""Ms Ley has always considered that you reapply for the job every three years, never taking anything for granted."" Ms Ley narrowly won the seat from the Nationals in 2001 after former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer retired. The spokesperson added the government has allocated $4.6 billion over four years in the budget for Indigenous health programs. ""Our electorate offices in Albury or Griffith are always open to hear from anyone with a concern or idea we can assist with."" The offices of Mr Giles and Defence Minister Peter Dutton were also contacted for comment.

38,"Welcome to a new kind of house, packed with features seldom seen before COVID-19",health," Science ""The Barnaby"" might be a strange name for a home of the future, but that's what this four-bedroom demonstration house claims to be. Located in a small town in North Carolina, it's the size of an average new house in Australia and looks pretty normal from the outside. Inside, the differences are obvious: a front-door ""vestibule"" for no-contact home delivery, two ""pocket"" home offices (neither of which is a bedroom), a school room, a quarantine room, a ""secret room"" behind a bookcase (for being alone), and a whopping four bathrooms. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is a design shaped by the pandemic. The team of architects, social researchers, and marketing experts that dreamed it up say every detail is informed by insights from a survey into the impact of the pandemic on homes and communities in the US. What about in Australia? Here, the property industry is seeing demand for features like those of The Barnaby (though not four bathrooms). The dedicated home office is king, and there's generally greater appreciation for good design and quality of construction. COVID-19 shone a light on all the pre-existing problems with our housing and asked us to do more with our houses, including working from home (WFH). So, what does an ideal post-COVID Australian home look like? And will any actually get built? The Barnaby's design choices were informed by the America at Home study, which surveyed more than 6,000 US adults in 2020. There's a new commercial rush to automate our homes and appliances. Is this how we'll live in the future? It found that Millennials and Gen Xers wanted relatively uncommon features such as germ-resistant countertops and flooring, greater energy efficiency, more storage for food or water, touch-free taps, appliances and toilets, and space for more than one home office. ""Post-pandemic, people have realised their homes can do more and that better design matters,"" said Nancy Keenan, president and chief executive officer of Dahlin Group Architecture Planning, the California-based firm that helped design The Barnaby demonstration house. Key to making a home do more is something called ""the flex space"", or a room with multiple potential uses. What this boils down to is an open-plan living room and kitchen, and then lots of ""acoustically secure"" (ie. decently soundproofed) medium-sized rooms that could be home offices, bedrooms, media rooms, and the like. Along with this, there's a scattering of tiny ""pocket flex spaces"" that could be used as smaller studies or walk-in wardrobes. The idea is that a whole family (The Barnaby was designed for a Millennial couple with two young children, where one parent works from home) can use the one house for lots of different things, all at the same time. ""Providing spaces in the home that can be used in many ways is key to a successful floor plan, especially when designing to smaller square footages,"" Ms Keenan said. ""Our clients are also exploring the viability of optioning flexible furniture systems and moveable walls to enhance space flexibility."" These trends can be seen in Australia. Every two years, property developer Mirvac surveys customers about what they're looking for in a house or an apartment. The most recent survey showed a clear shift in thinking, said Diana Sarcasmo, head of design at Mirvac, which has $26 billion worth of assets under management in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. ""Half the people we spoke to in the survey said they were looking for a hybrid working arrangement going forward,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. That change is reflected in demand for home offices. ""There's been a 20 per cent increase in people in apartments asking for a study. And in housing, there's double the number."" The surge in pet ownership during lockdowns means people are willing to pay extra for doggy doors and dog-wash facilities. And hours spent WFH has made people aware of ""sustainability upgrades"" like thermal insulation. In the short space of one year, Annabelle and Alex have slashed the money they spend on electricity, gas and petrol to zero. Here's how they did it. ""People have always wanted sustainability upgrades, but weren't willing to pay for them,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. ""Now 64 per cent say they're willing to pay extra. That's a massive shift over the last couple of years."" George Massoud, design director at Frasers Property, another large developer, agreed. He's also seen people placing greater value on ""things like quality of light, ventilation, and acoustics"". And the home office with a door you can close is here to stay. ""The mediocre study nook doesn't cut it anymore."" Of course, it's harder finding space for all this in an apartment. Since the onset of COVID-19, house values have out-performed those of units. And dwelling values (houses and units) in regional areas have increased much more than those in capital cities. Eliza Owen, head of research at CoreLogic Australia, said the need for space was a contributing factor. ""Larger, more spacious homes allowed for a home office, and larger properties in regional Australia even allowed people to create their own oasis for entertainment and recreation amid the pandemic,"" she said. So are Australians ditching the inner-city apartment? No, Ms Sarcasmo says. ""There was a feeling during the middle of the pandemic that people would be driven further out of the city,"" she said. ""But in the last several months, what we've seen is great demand for apartment projects, if they're well located with amenities."" Mr Massoud, agreed: the picture was more complicated than Australians buying large houses in regional areas. Size matters, but so does, increasingly, location. People want to live in urban environments that are within walking distance to parks, cafes, pubs, restaurants, and the like. One reason for this may be the rise of WFH: We're taking greater interest in our local community. ""In homes and the apartment space, people are really assessing what's beyond their four walls,"" Mr Massoud said. He also believes homes won't get much bigger. ""I don't see larger homes being a trend, but I do see major improvements in quality."" Though Australia doesn't yet have its own version of The Barnaby , architects are working at imagining how our houses and apartments might be better designed to suit our needs. In March this year, a Brisbane exhibition featured the work of 10 Australian architects who had been invited to develop new concepts of the home and residential environments. The designs included a much greater focus on community and connection, including shared amenities for apartments, as well as verandahs, walkways, and verge gardens to connect neighbours. The exhibition itself was the idea of the Architecture et Cetera Lab, formed by three Griffith University design academics and practising architects, Cecilia Bischeri, Zuzana Kovar and Jessica Blair. ""COVID put what we consider normality under scrutiny,"" Dr Bischeri said. ""Residential space is becoming a habitat, in the sense we are going to function 24/7 in this space. ""Houses need to accommodate all interests and activities that in a normal situation you would experience outside."" Residential architects have seen a big increase in demand for their services, said Shannon Battisson, national president of the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA). In Canberra, where she works, public servants have been spending money on their homes, rather than on overseas holidays. ""One of the big things COVID has done has made people think, 'Hey, we might spend a lot of time here in the future and it's worth doing it well.' ""We went from having a six-month waiting list for our projects, and then that blew out to two years."" What people want isn't the only factor that decides what gets built. Most new apartments, for instance, are built for investors rather than owner-occupiers, says Tom Alves, head of development at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. ""The shape and form of those apartments is not driven by need, but by global investment,"" he said. Houses are similar: Less than 6 per cent of new houses in Australia have architectural involvement. So far, COVID-19 hasn't had a big impact on the regulation determining the minimum standards for houses and units, Dr Alves said. The 2021 update to the Victorian Government's 2017 Better Apartment Design Standards addressed problems with poor acoustic and visual privacy, a lack of natural light, and an inflexible floor plan. Outlining the changes, the Victorian Government website states: ""More than ever, the coronavirus pandemic has shown us that all homes need to have access to air, nature, sunlight and personal space."" Other states and territories have not updated their apartment design standards since the outbreak of COVID-19. The National Construction Code, which sets minimum performance and quality requirements for new housing in Australia, is in the process of being updated to ensure homes are better insulated and energy efficient (though this was set in train well before the pandemic). COVID-19 will change design in Australia, but it may not be as widespread as we might like, Ms Battisson said. ""I think we'll be quick to revert to our usual ways."" But there is one sign of hope, at least in her opinion: fewer people are asking for home theatres. ""We're really against things like home theatres — it's a room that's pretty big and dark and can't be used for anything else. ""In COVID, not a single person asked for a home theatre. ""I'm kind of hoping they won't come back strongly after the pandemic."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

39,"Aged care homes don't need 'evidence' on food spending to receive government funding, with a third still spending less than $10 a day",health,"  Aged care homes don't need 'evidence' on food spending to receive government funding, with a third still spending less than $10 a day Aged care operators will receive an extra $3 billion in government funding to improve food, but have been told they do not need to provide ""spreadsheets or evidence"" of how much they are spending in order to get the cash. Instead, providers have to answer two questions each quarter regarding how much they spend on food prepared on and off-site. The first public report on the scheme shows that two-thirds of operators said they are spending on average $14 a day per resident on food while a third — or 883 operators – said they spent less than $10 a day. Two per cent of operators said they continued to spend less than $6 a day. But the providers do not require any proof of their spending, with the Department of Health telling providers: ""We are not asking you to provide us with spreadsheets or evidence that supports your answers. You are expected to keep a record of how you calculate the information you provide us."" ""I don't think without a clear audit trail, without the spreadsheets and so on, you can be fooled that they actually did spend the money on this,"" said Stephen Duckett, health economist and former secretary of the Department of Health. A spokesperson for Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck said the mechanism to report spending on food will be expanded when the new aged care funding system is introduced. Celebrity chef Maggie Beer, whose foundation advocates for better food in aged care, said it was not possible to provide three meals and snacks for $10 a day. ""We have a responsibility to look after those in aged care, those that are no longer able to look after themselves in that way,"" she told the ABC's 7.30. ""To me, it's just totally unacceptable."" The government announced its plan to give an extra $10 per day, per resident in the 2021 Budget, just months after the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety's damning report into the sector. When the federal government increased its funding, it said it was to support ""aged care providers to deliver better care and services to residents, with a focus on food and nutrition"". Let us know if you have a story or issue you'd like us to look into. Email aged.care@abc.net.au to tell us your story. One of the royal commission's many criticisms of the federal government and the aged care sector was the lack of transparency on how taxpayer dollars were spent. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told 7.30's Leigh Sales on Budget night last year that the regulator, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, would make sure the extra money was spent on residents. ""We're putting hundreds of extra audits every year,"" he said. ""There's going to be new powers for the regulators, a more coordinated system to ensure that the money being spent is getting to the residents."" The Department of Health said the 883 aged care homes spending less than $10 a day had been referred to the regulator for monitoring. But 7.30 can reveal the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission audited 41 of the homes, or 5 per cent. It found three had failed food standards. A spokesperson for the regulator said: ""Decisions are still pending for some of the 41 services. ""Therefore, the number of decisions of non-compliance with this requirement may change."" Mr Duckett argues the regulator should have performed unannounced audits on all those facilities. ""We don't want our grannies and so on to be given awful food, and the government cannot guarantee us that that actually is no longer happening,"" Mr Duckett said. The CEO of Leading Age Services Australia, Sean Rooney, said the Basic Daily Fee in residential aged care is designed to cover the costs range of ""hotel services"", including meals and refreshments, laundry, cleaning, social activities, basic toiletries, and help in emergencies. He said figures showed that 60 per cent of aged care facilities were operating at a loss. The Department of Health said it would not be releasing the next two Food and Nutrition reports of providers until after the end of the financial year. Staff, dieticians and families around the country have sent photos to the ABC showing that after the funding increase, food has not improved in their nursing homes. Dietician Anne Shneyder from Nutrition Professionals Australia said she is still seeing the same problems that she saw more than 20 years ago. ""I see things like … the evening meal, where cheaper or low-protein items are served,"" she said. ""Things like little pies and pasties, things like fish patties with not much fish in them … dim sims, tinned spaghetti."" Julia Davis, whose mother Barbara was a resident at Castlemaine Health in Victoria before she died earlier this year, had relocated so she could be close to her mum and cook meals to take to her. Ms Davis felt that the food her mother was receiving was so poor in quality that ""[mother] would have starved"" if she hadn't been there. She said she did not see any improvement in food when the supplement came in and despite her complaints, the regulator found the nursing home passed all food standards. Castlemaine Health said the regulator found that ""most consumers enjoyed the food"" and that it was a suitable quantity and quality, however it declined to say how much it spent per day. To improve food quality in nursing homes, in 2019 the federal government gave a grant from a dementia fund totalling almost $600,000 to the Maggie Beer Foundation to produce a series of online training videos for chefs and cooks in the sector. Last month, the foundation released the online training videos, which many in the industry believed would be available free of charge. Instead, 11 modules cost about $480 – or $44 per half-hour video. Mr Duckett said he thinks most Australians were under the impression that all aged care homes would be able to benefit. ""Not every residential aged care facility is going to participate because some are very small and can't afford these things, even if it's a small price,"" he said. ""So I think, unfortunately, what I think the public thought was going to help everybody is probably not actually what the business model is."" Maggie Beer said the foundation received only a portion of the money, which paid for a moderator for an online forum available to those who completed the training modules. She said the majority of the money would go to Altura Learning, who produced the videos. ""I would love to think that we had the support to make them free to everyone in aged care, but we have to deal with the economic issues of Altura's business,"" she said. Altura Learning is owned by aged care provider Bolton Clarke, and told 7.30 it charges a small fee to stream and host the lessons. Other dieticians and chefs in the sector have also raised concerns that the online videos are too advanced for cooks working in aged care who have no training. They say some of the ingredients are not readily available or too expensive. ""I think the videos are fantastic for somebody who is really trying very hard already to do a good job and would like to further improve their practice,"" Ms Shneyder said. ""But I think there's also that need for some more fundamental training for staff who may have very few skills."" Maggie Beer disagrees. ""Following the online modules will give the cook or the chef the basic skills,"" she said. ""Some of the ingredients are optional. For instance, if you're making a fish soup, and we have saffron in it, saffron is optional. ""There are people and there are homes where food is so important. They don't want it dumbed down. ""And I don't want anything dumbed down, but I want everything accessible."" In 2020, the Maggie Beer Foundation received another grant from the Department of Health of almost $300,000 for a two-day national congress on aged care food, nutrition, and the dining experience. Aged care worker Glen O'Driscoll says staff are overworked and worn out. The Coalition has promised billions since the royal commission, but Labor is making aged care an election issue. Labor has also pledged to invest $5 million through the iconic chef's foundation to develop new food standards and more training programs for chefs. Mr Duckett said enlisting Maggie Beer to the cause made Australians believe food standards in aged care had improved. ""She has a tremendous reputation, and I think the Maggie Beer Foundation saying it's going to do this actually gives the government a lot of credibility, and I think that's what they want,"" he said. ""The public thought it was going to fix everything and I think the government traded on that and was not as clear with what they're actually doing.""

40,"Scott Morrison rules out overturning assisted dying ban on territories, sparking Senate candidate fight",health,"  Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed a re-elected Coalition government won't allow the Northern Territory and ACT a chance to vote on legalising voluntary assisted dying. As of Thursday it is legal in every state, after a marathon debate saw laws pass through New South Wales parliament on Thursday morning. However, the Northern Territory and ACT don't have the ability to pass assisted dying laws, due to a long-standing Commonwealth ban on Australia's territories holding a vote on the issue. ""There are differences between territories and states, and that is under constitution, and we are not proposing any changes to that,"" Mr Morrison said on Thursday. It has now erupted as an election issue in the Northern Territory, with a Country Liberal Party candidate accused of ""treachery"" for not supporting the NT Parliament being allowed a vote. When asked last week if the Northern Territory should be permitted to vote on the issue, Country Liberal Party senate candidate Jacinta Price said she ""wouldn't be committed to supporting that"". ""We're not trying to support people ending their lives,"" Ms Price said. ""I don't trust this current Territory Government to make any wise decisions on behalf of Territorians. ""I'm certainly not going to trust them in making decisions around the lives of vulnerable Indigenous Australians."" Former CLP senator Sam McMahon, who is now running as a candidate for minor party the Liberal Democrats, released a statement blasting Ms Price's point of view on Thursday. ""This is nothing more than an act of outright treachery from a self-centred person who does not have and never will have the interests of Territorians at heart,"" she said. Dr McMahon, who was beaten by Ms Price for CLP preselection last year, has been a supporter of the Northern Territory regaining a right to vote on the issue. During her term in parliament, she put forward a private member's bill to overturn the federal government's block on the territories' voting rights. A former CLP Northern Territory chief minister has also voiced his disappointment in Ms Price's comments. Marshall Perron, a long-time voluntary assisted dying advocate, and the leader whose party made it legal in the NT for a period in the 90s, said Ms Price's position ""surprised me enormously"". ""We're talking about the capacity of elected representatives, of Territorians, making this decision for themselves,"" Mr Perron said. ""It's a bit of an insult to consider that they don't have the intellectual capacity or integrity to handle that decision on behalf of Territorians."" Federal Labor on Thursday alluded to a conscience vote being allowed on the issue if it won government. ""I'm a big supporter of conscience votes,"" Labor leader Anthony Albanese said. ""I think there should be more, not less, conscience votes."" A Federal Labor spokesman said, if elected, the party would ""facilitate the introduction, debate and vote"" of a standalone private members or senators bill to allow Australia's territories to make laws on voluntary assisted dying. The Northern Territory was the first jurisdiction in Australia to legalise assisted dying, in 1995, a move that was overruled by John Howard's Liberal Government in 1997. Since then, the territories have been denied a vote on the issue.

41,SA Opposition Leader accused of 'dog whistling' to anti-vaxxers after 'dictatorship' gibe,health,"  South Australia's Health Minister has hit back at Opposition Leader David Speirs for ""dog whistling to the anti-vaxxer movement"" after the Liberal leader accused the state's new Premier of running a ""Dark-Age dictatorship"" in relation to new emergency COVID-19 powers. A law that will change the way South Australia manages COVID-19 restrictions officially passed parliament today. The legislation gives cabinet the power to make COVID-19 declarations that would last a maximum of six months. Under the changes, the maximum penalties for non-compliance with a direction would remain at two years' jail or up to a $20,000 fine for individuals, with businesses in breach facing penalties of up to $75,000. Yesterday, Mr Speirs labelled such sanctions ""draconian"" and suggested they were unsuited to pandemic policing in a changed COVID-19 environment. ""What we're seeing from Peter Malinauskas here is a Dark-Age dictatorship tantamount to something that you would expect to see in Victoria under Dan Andrews. South Australia is more progressive than that,"" Mr Speirs said yesterday. In parliament today, Health Minister Chris Picton hit back and said the previous level of bi-partisanship between the two major parties had deteriorated. ""This sort of dog whistling to the anti-vaxxer movement, I think, has been incredibly unfortunate,"" Mr Picton said. ""The penalty provisions are exactly the same as what the previous government had over the past two years."" However, Mr Speirs hit back in turn, doubling down on his earlier comparison. ""It's a dictatorial approach to have these heavy-handed penalties, which are outside and out of step with these jurisdictions across our nation,"" Mr Speirs said. ""We made it clear from day one that we supported the sentiment of this bill, we supported that move from major emergency declaration into public health legislation for the next phase of the COVID 19 pandemic. ""But we felt that it had to be backed up by a step-down in some of the penalties."" Premier Peter Malinauskas criticised Mr Speirs for using ""highly provocative language"" while in a position of leadership. ""David Speirs is going towards the lowest common denominator to try [to] whip up fear among a minority of South Australians,"" Mr Malinauskas said. The Premier said the new legislation would instead provide certainty to South Australians. ""We have passed legislative change to the Public Health Act by the 30th of June this year,"" he said. ""This will provide a lot more security and certainty to business in South Australia, knowing [that], at any moment, they won't be subject to a dramatic increase in restrictions, without another Emergency Management Declaration."" South Australia today recorded another increase in daily COVID-19 numbers, with 4,395 new cases and five deaths reported in the latest 24-hour reporting period. Hospital admissions remain steady, with 246 people with COVID-19 in hospital across the state. There are 25,629 known active cases.

42,COVID-positive Australians fume as AEC confirms they 'may not be able to vote',health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes People who tested positive for COVID-19 between Saturday and Tuesday are ""angry"" that the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has said they ""may not be able to vote"" this election. Australians who tested positive after Tuesday at 6pm can apply to vote via phone, while those who tested positive between Saturday and Tuesday have been advised to apply for a postal vote. But postal votes are unlikely to reach people like Melbourne's Nicola Fry in time, according to the AEC website. Ms Fry tested positive on Tuesday morning. ""I didn’t want to go through that avenue, because I wanted my vote to be counted,"" she told ABC Radio Melbourne. At the time, Ms Fry's family said they were advised by an AEC representative that they could vote over the phone. But Ms Fry later discovered that advice was incorrect and that she would only be eligible to vote over the phone if she tested positive after 6pm on Tuesday. Unable to vote via post and ineligible for a phone vote, Nicola Fry and her three family members say they will not be able to cast their ballots. ""I'm very angry and helpless,"" she said. ""I can't believe I've been disenfranchised in this way."" Multiple Australians diagnosed with COVID-19 between Saturday and Tuesday contacted the ABC saying they were in a similar situation. Melbourne's Michelle McLeod-Dryden tested positive for COVID on Sunday. Her husband found he had the virus on Monday. Ms McLeod-Dryden attempted to register for a postal vote on the AEC website but was told it would not arrive in time. After an AEC representative informed her she could vote via phone, she discovered she was ineligible when she tried to sign up on Tuesday evening. While she understood she would not get a fine, she said she was ""really disappointed"". ""I'm not worried about the fine,"" she said. ""I've never missed an election — this will be the first. ""There's been adequate time to prepare for this. ""It's just not good enough."" They've both spent their lives in politics but come May 21, one will be prime minister and the other will likely face the end of their political career. Melbourne's Kate Rees tested positive at midday on Tuesday, but was able to secure a phone vote after contacting her local member. Ms Rees said she was unable to do a postal vote because she lived by herself in an apartment complex and would not have a witness to sign off on her paperwork. ""My MP's office contacted the AEC who then contacted me,"" she said. ""I'm still very stressed — I don't know if they'll chase me up for putting my positive RAT [result in] at midday instead of 6pm."" While she was able to put in her vote, she was concerned for other Australians who lived alone or in rural areas. ""It's a form of voter disenfranchisement,"" she said. An Australian Electoral Commission spokesperson said people who tested positive to COVID between Saturday and 6pm Tuesday ""may not be able to vote"". ""People who tested positive to COVID between Saturday and 6pm Tuesday were able to apply for a postal vote up until 6pm Wednesday,"" the spokesperson said. ""People who did not apply for a postal vote before the application cut-off, haven’t voted yet, tested positive before 6pm Tuesday, and are in isolation through to after election day, may not be able to vote. ""Telephone voting is an emergency service only, for the unique circumstances of the pandemic, with deadlines set in the legislation/regulations."" The spokesperson said ""relevant health authorities"" had been sending COVID-positive Australians text messages and emails ""about their voting options since Saturday"". But the $20 fine for failing to vote would not apply for Australians diagnosed with COVID-19 who were unable to vote. ""If a person cannot access the services available in their area, they will receive a letter from the AEC after the election informing there is no record of them voting,"" the AEC told the ABC. ""From there, they would then be able to advise the AEC that they were isolating with COVID-19 on election day, and they would not receive a fine."" The election race is on. With COVID-19 still causing problems and more people voting than ever, here's what the electoral poll will look like. The spokesperson said the AEC was going to ""every effort"" to ensure postal votes were delivered in time. Listeners contacted ABC Radio Melbourne suggesting COVID-positive people complete another RAT after the Tuesday 6pm deadline and claim they tested positive on this date to become eligible for a phone vote. ""The intention of the legislation is for each cohort of voters to have an option available to them and for people to plan their vote,"" an AEC spokesperson said. ""People registering for telephone voting will be making a declaration about the circumstances of their test."" Australians can register up until 4:00pm AEST on election day for a telephone vote on the AEC website. The Human Rights Law Centre's Hugh de Kretser said the situation was ""alarming"". ""The right to vote is the most fundamental part of our democracy,"" he said. ""The right of Australians to participate in the electoral process is enshrined in the Constitution and has been upheld by the High Court on many occasions. ""We are alarmed that the AEC is adopting an interpretive approach that seems to be contrary to the intent of the Electoral Act."" He said the AEC's position risked ""disenfranchising tens of thousands of Australians"". ""We urge the AEC to clarify its position immediately,"" he said.

43,Victoria's embattled triple-0 service board to be disbanded and service renamed after review,health,"  Victoria's crisis-riddled triple-0 system ESTA to be overhauled following damning review Victoria's embattled triple-0 service will be renamed and its board disbanded as part of a state government overhaul, amid blown-out waiting times for critically ill patients and staff shortages. The Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA) will be rebadged as Triple Zero Victoria, with the government also pledging ""major governance changes and reforms in relation to performance standards"". Former police commissioner Graham Ashton has been reviewing ESTA's performance, and said the agency had displayed ""continued and systematic underperformance"". ""The review established that internally ESTA, pre-October 2021, operated more as a corporate entity than an organisation delivering a critical emergency management service,"" Mr Ashton found. The review, released on Thursday, was commissioned after numerous reports of ESTA's call system crashing, putting lives at risk. Since October last year, up to 12 Victorians have died while waiting for an ambulance, as the overwhelmed system continues to be plagued by long delays and staff shortages. At least 12 Victorians have died while waiting for an ambulance since October. ""Over its short history the number of times when the system has failed continues to grow, often with dire outcomes,"" the report reads. Ambulance Victoria faced its busiest quarter in history during the first three months of the year as COVID-19 cases surged. During that time, about one third of urgent code 1 ambulance patients waited more than the target time. The demand rose from an average of about 2,000 calls per day in October 2020 to a peak of about 4,000 per day in January 2022. The government said it supported ""in principle"" the 20 recommendations made by Mr Ashton. They include shifting the agency to be part of the Department of Justice and Community Safety, extra government funding for more staff, and changes to improve call-taking and responses. The state government said the new governance model would improve the agency's links with police, paramedics and fire rescue services. Emergency Services Minister Jaclyn Symes said the government would consult with the existing ESTA board, emergency service organisations, unions and others to implement the changes. ""Victorians should have the confidence that when they call for help in an emergency, they will get it,"" she said. Ms Symes said the urgent priority would be improving call-taking and dispatch, with governance changes and performance standards reforms ""expected to follow in 2023"". Ms Symes acknowledged the work of ESTA's dedicated call-takers, dispatchers and other staff under ""sustained, unprecedented and pandemic-related pressures"", pressing the point that the government was backing the workers. The government said ESTA's existing board would be replaced by a new advisory board, including members of police, ambulance and fire services. Former chief executive Marty Smyth resigned from the role in the weeks after the review was announced and was replaced by interim leader Stephen Leane, a former Victoria Police assistant commissioner and ESTA board member. Speaking on Thursday at the government's press conference, Mr Leane said ""we've been doing everything we can"" to meet community demand. He said he had experienced the ""upset"" of unions and staff who felt they had been unable to do their jobs but said he was now ""more than satisfied"" the organisation had a good relationship with its workers. Broder Lackmann, whose 32-year-old sister Christina died inside her home in April 2021 after calling triple-0 and waiting hours for help, said it was reassuring that steps were being taken to avoid similar tragedies occurring. ""It's one piece of the puzzle,"" he said. ""I think there's probably a range of things that need to happen to completely fix everything."" On that night in 2021, the cancer researcher told a triple-0 operator she had begun feeling dizzy while cooking dinner and was told she would be called back. She waited 6 hours for an ambulance and was later found dead in her bathroom by paramedics. When her brother checked her phone, he saw 10 missed calls from Ambulance Victoria. The organisation later revealed two ambulances had been dispatched to help Christina, but both had been diverted to jobs deemed more serious. Mr Lackmann said making it through the recent anniversary of his sister's death was hard, but it was ""good to hear"" action would be taken to improve the service as a result of the review. ""What … was evident to us that resulted in the misdiagnosis in my sister's situation has been addressed, so I'm quite buoyed by that,"" he said. Opposition health spokesperson Georgie Crozier criticised the timing of the report's release. ""It's a disgrace that the government has the gall to do this, at this time, at such a late stage in the federal election campaign,"" she said. ""Under the cover of that campaign they are hiding this report, which has got many issues that should have been fixed years ago [and] demonstrates the extent of the mismanagement of triple-0."" She said the issues with the state's triple-0 service should have been addressed when they were first raised, years ago. ""Yet we've got the Andrews government that have sat on their hands and done nothing,"" she said. ""Victorians have tragically lost their lives while they've done that."" Ambulance Union secretary Danny Hill said the issues with ESTA had resulted in resources being misdirected. ""If you look at the situation that we're in today, with ambulance crews going to a lot of very non-urgent cases, a lot of that comes about due to a very clunky and, at times, archaic call-taking and dispatch system,"" he said. ""So, being able to rapidly upgrade that and improve that as the situation changes is going to be really important."" Mr Hill said he was pleased the report didn't just say that more money needed to be invested in extra triple-0 staff. ""Clearly, there's going to need to be a long-term investment in more staff, but I'm pleased that the report doesn't just make those recommendations,"" he said. ""They actually look at how they get the most out of the service by improving its culture, improving its performance standards and making sure it ties in with other emergency services."" Diana Schumacher reached out to the emergency services for help. Then she had to treat herself. Ms Symes also encouraged people to consider contacting on-call nurses or their doctors if possible, instead of calling triple-0. ""Your ambulance is not a taxi … if it is not an emergency situation, please consider alternatives,"" she said. The government announced funding for about 120 new call-takers in March and confirmed in its budget earlier this month that $333 million was allocated to recruit a total of 400 new ESTA staff. A second review into ESTA, conducted by inspector-general for emergency management Tony Pearce, is also underway. Ms Symes defended the timing of the report's release, made public two days before the federal election. ""Today could look cynical, but it was not the intention. The intention was to get it out as soon as possible,"" she said. Ms Symes confirmed she received the report in March. Senior ministers have faced questions from Opposition MPs about why it was not released earlier. Ms Symes said since the government received the report it had been working with stakeholders and preparing a formal response to the Ashton review.

44,St John WA chief stands firm at helm as report puts ambulance service on notice,health," Coronavirus Western Australia has recorded its highest number of new COVID-19 cases as the fallout from problems affecting St John Ambulance continues, with a report saying alternatives should be considered if the service does not improve within five years. Another six people have died with the virus on a day when a record 17,105 coronavirus infections have been reported in the state. WA now has 88,781 active cases while 300 people are in hospital with the virus, down from 327, with 10 in intensive care. The previous peak in daily cases for WA was 17,033, set on Wednesday last week. Amidst COVID-related staff shortages in the health system and at St John Ambulance, a parliamentary committee report on the delivery of ambulance services in WA has been tabled in parliament. The report, including its 74 findings and 48 recommendations, was tabled by Upper House whip and chair of the public administration committee Pierre Yang, who then made a statement. ""The inquiry revealed emergency ambulance services in metropolitan Perth are under significant strain,"" he said. The committee had made a number of recommendations to address the fact St John had been unable to achieve its contractual target response times for emergency calls in the 2020-2021 financial year. Mr Yang said the government should review the implementation of the recommendations within the next five years and consider alternative emergency ambulance service providers or a state-run service if service delivery did not improve. The recommendations included: The delivery of the report comes as COVID-furloughing and record levels of ambulance ramping plague WA Health and St John Ambulance. An investigation is also continuing into the death of Georgina Wild, who waited two hours for an ambulance on Sunday morning, in a scenario the government has labelled as ""unacceptable"". Ms Wild was the third woman to die in a month after issues with the ambulance service, following the deaths of a Geraldton woman while waiting for an ambulance, and a Busselton woman who was in the care of paramedics when she died after waiting three hours for treatment. There have also been reports a man in Perth's east died of a suspected heart attack after waiting more than two hours for an ambulance on Sunday morning. St John chief executive Michelle Fyfe said she had not yet had an opportunity to review and respond in detail to the report, which she received today. ""We will deliver our response to the Minister for Health in the next six weeks,"" she said. However, Ms Fyfe said she was pleased the report acknowledged the impact of ambulance ramping and the need for further investment in regional areas. Ms Fyfe shut down questions from media about whether she would resign, saying she would continue to lead the organisation through ""the most difficult time we have seen in our history"". Premier Mark McGowan says WA's ambulance service could have asked the Department of Fire and Emergency Services for help on the night Georgina Wild died. ""I've got 40 years' experience in emergency services,"" she said. ""We haven't been at business as usual in over two-and-a-half years … we have been operating in a state of emergency. ""I'm the leader of this organisation and I'm the best person to lead us through it."" She threw her full support behind St John's ""frontline workers"" and said the service had been preparing a ""listening strategy"" around workplace culture, diversity and inclusion to address issues raised by staff. Yesterday, it was announced two senior police officers and two senior health officials, including the deputy chief health officer, would be embedded at St John Ambulance. This weekend will also see 48 firefighters trained to drive ambulances and work alongside paramedics to help meet staffing shortages. Speaking before the report was tabled, Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson reiterated the use of firefighters to drive ambulances was an option available to St John when it experienced a 40 per cent drop in staff on Sunday morning. ""I think it's pretty obvious that it should have been used earlier, I think the fact that it hasn't does cause significant concern for the government,"" she said. Ms Sanderson said in an agreement with St John, she would now receive daily briefings from the organisation. ""We have made a new agreement with them over a series of meetings that have occurred this week, that we will receive an update every day on staffing levels, furlough levels, the number of ambulances on the road, where the pressure points are, so on and so forth,"" she said. ""So that we can help them, so that we can work with them. ""We want to know where they are finding challenges handing over patients in emergency departments, so that we can work there and clear that blockage."" Also speaking before the report was tabled, Shadow Health Minister Libby Mettam claimed it may have been influenced by the unions. ""It is clear the unions have wanted a public sector takeover of St John Ambulance for many years,"" she said. For the first time in its history, St John is warning Perth residents of extremely high demand for its services amid escalating COVID numbers. ""The committee is chaired by a union member, and the ultimate decision will be made by the minister for health who has been promoted for her connections with that union as well."" Ms Mettam said there was no way to ignore the impact of ramping on the ambulance service, and said that was the result of an under-resourced hospital system. ""The fact that we had about 21,000 hours of ambulance ramping this year so far, compared with the whole of 2020, illustrates the pressure that our ambulance service is under,"" she said. ""And it's because we don't have capacity in our hospital system, we went into the pandemic with the lowest number of available public beds per capita in the country. ""The McGowan government also needs to look at the whole health system which is frankly in a mess and its WA patients that are paying the price."" The United Workers Union (UWU), which represents paramedics and other emergency service workers, conceded it had been campaigning for St John to be brought back into the public service for more than five years. While many in Western Australia are enjoying new freedoms, some in the community are choosing to stay home. UWU National Ambulance Coordinator Fiona Scalon said the ""systemic failures"" identified in the report required immediate attention. ""The recommendations are comprehensive and I hope they will bring about change within St John but the five-year deadline is way too lenient,"" Ms Scalon said. ""Workers are burned out now, people are dying now. The [West] Australian community cannot afford another five years. ""The ambulance service is an essential government service and, as such, should be run as an essential government service, not one controlled by private interests and associated low levels of transparency and accountability."" Ms Scalon said the report also brought to light issues raised by frontline workers over many years, such as workplace culture.

45,'I'm not getting vaccinated': Pauline Hanson tests positive to COVID days before election,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes One Nation Party leader Pauline Hanson has tested positive to COVID-19 days out from the federal election. The Senator revealed the news on radio on Thursday morning. ""I'm up to s***,"" Senator Hanson told KIIS radio, when asked how she was going. ""I've got COVID,"" she said, while coughing. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The 67-year-old said she believed she caught the virus while campaigning in Western Australia. ""I travel the five states around the whole of Australia campaigning but I go to the most locked-down state, last week, to Western Australia, and I got it,"" she said. Ms Hanson, who is standing for re-election as a Queensland senator on Saturday, did not say how she knew she had contracted it in Western Australia. Senator Hanson said she has not been vaccinated and her symptoms have not been too bad. ""I've told you that before before, I'm not getting vaccinated,"" she told the Kyle and Jackie O Show. ""Guess what? I haven't been in hospital, I'm still kicking, I'm alive, I'm fine. ""Anyway, it's all good, it's like I've had a heavy cold."" Senator Hanson confirmed the diagnosis in a statement, which said symptoms developed on Friday but she did not test positive until Saturday. ""I will self-isolate in accordance with the current rules, and do my best to drive One Nation policies from home ahead of this weekend,"" Senator Hanson said in the statement. ""I thank all of those people who have sent their well wishes, and apologise to those who had hoped that I would drop dead."" This election One Nation had been promising to end COVID-19 vaccination mandates and has made regular appearances at ""freedom rallies"". In late March, Senator Hanson submitted a signed petition calling on the federal government to establish a broad royal commission into ""the true facts and the management of the COVID-19 pandemic"". We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. While advocating for interstate borders to open in 2021, Ms Hanson said Australians were being ""imprisoned"" in their homes. ""If we have to close our international borders to foreign arrivals in order to open up Australia to its own citizens then that is what we should be doing,"" she wrote on social media in August 2021. ""Scott Morrison may not be able to control state borders but he can shut the gate to the foreign arrivals who have been bringing COVID-19 to our shores."" In 2020, Pauline Hanson accused the United Nations of using COVID-19 to push ""climate alarmism agenda"". ""Imagine how much better off we would be right now if Australia had spent the last two decades focused on growing our manufacturing capacity instead of fighting a climate change boogeyman?"" she wrote on social media in April 2020.

46,'The two head honchos can't even come here': Here's why outback voters feel forgotten,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes With just two days until the federal election, voters in the Kimberley say they feel unseen and unacknowledged by the campaigns from all sides of politics. The electorate of Durack is one of the world's largest in terms of geography and is considered a safe Liberal seat with a margin of 13.5 per cent. But the Kimberley, which falls in the north of the electorate, is a stronghold for the ALP and has been held by Labor at state level for nearly four decades. Labor won six of the region's eight fixed polling booths two-party preferred at the 2019 poll; the Liberals dominated the vast electorate's southern reaches. It means the Kimberley is an ultra-safe state seat for Labor wrapped in one of the safest federal seats held by the Liberal Party. No major party leaders have visited the Kimberley during the campaign, and no major policy announcements have been made to address the region's complex challenges. It's been a frustrating campaign for mother of three Hannah Anderson, who relocated to Broome from Perth with her husband about 18 months ago. She said she had noticed the lack of emphasis on Kimberley issues compared to the city since the election was called. ""I feel like the Kimberley is not a focus of our governments; they focus on the bigger cities and things that will win them votes,"" she said. ""Somewhere like Broome … we need help. Just for the average family we need something that will make Broome somewhere we can live and where we want to stay."" Ms Anderson wants to return to work but needs to secure places in child care or after-school care for her kids, who are all aged under five. While Labor has flagged increased subsidies for child care and out-of-hours care, Ms Anderson said it would not address the fundamental issue — the lack of workers available to service regional childcare centres. ""We just can't get in anywhere, we've been on waitlists for months and months, there's just no spaces available,"" she said. ""We put the kids on the waitlist in September and it's now May, but we've been told at least a year [before they can secure a place]. ""With COVID and everything, they lost a lot of staff and they haven't been able to recover and that affects the number of kids they can have in their centres."" Broome's Kathy Watson said health care in the Kimberley had also been overlooked during the federal campaign. Ms Watson, an Indigenous health pioneer in the region, said while service delivery had improved over the years, there was still little understanding in Canberra about what was needed in WA's remotest areas. ""The two head honchos of the major parties can't even come here,"" she said. ""They wouldn't know from a bar of soap what our people need, not only Indigenous but also non-Indigenous. ""They say they'll do this or that, you don't see any of them, whether Labor or Liberal."" Ms Watson said Kimberley-specific funding packages were needed to match the complex nature of healthcare delivery in the region. ""A lot of people are in outlying communities … there could be stuff they want to do with regards to health, but money-wise [they need] funding."" She urged decision-makers to visit the region after the election to better understand the challenges faced by locals and to determine what future federal investment was needed. ""Don't go by plane — drive, and go on bumpy roads and see what it's like if it's an emergency and the Royal Flying Doctor Service can't land especially in the wet season ... this is what they have to cope with. ""Then you'll know all about the needs of people in the Kimberley, both black and white. Get off your high horse and come and visit."" Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Kimberley email newsletter Crime is also one of the most pressing issues facing voters in the Kimberley, with escalating rates of burglaries, trespass and damage becoming a growing problem across the region. The Liberal Party is yet to announce any funds to specifically target the region's youth crime problem this campaign despite federal incumbent MP Melissa Price describing the region as a ""war zone"". Ms Price recently commented on Facebook that $30 million of federal funds had been directed to ""youth diversionary programs"" in the region, but said she did not have all the details about what the investment entailed. The federal Liberals have committed significant funds across the border in the marginal NT seat of Lingiari, including $14 million to prevent crime in Alice Springs. Meanwhile, Labor candidate Jeremiah Riley is also yet to announce any commitment to tackle crime in the Kimberley, despite his party committing $79 million in Lingiari into communities for justice reinvestment. It is the type of commitment Kununurra businessman Gary Alexander would like to see pledged for the Kimberley. Mr Alexander's cafe was ram-raided earlier this year by juveniles driving a stolen car. He wants whichever party that forms government to step up and announce funds to help address the region's youth crime issues. ""There's a lot to be done in our town with youth crime. I think there needs to be a joint approach to the issues that are here. ""I think it is probably the top pocket [of the state] that's probably more often forgotten about than it should be … being so far from Perth, so far from Canberra. ""There are significant issues that need to be dealt with that are not dealt with."" Notre Dame University political analyst Martin Drum said the latest redistribution of electoral boundaries meant major party campaigns had been focused further south. ""There's been some changes to the federal seat of Durack, principally the adding of a whole range of areas from Pearce, which borders the metropolitan boundary of Perth,"" he said. ""There's quite a significant population centred down there and that then pulls the campaigning further south. ""So in terms of the Kimberley, that makes it even tougher for it to be covered in great detail … and results in those candidates that are campaigning probably giving more attention to the south of the seat.""

47,Privacy failures in WA contact tracing laid bare after highly sensitive personal information put at risk,health,"  WA's COVID-19 contact tracing system is plagued with significant privacy and security concerns, putting at risk highly sensitive personal and medical information collected from more than half a million people. Those are the findings from an auditor-general report tabled in parliament yesterday that examined the way the Health Department handled data collected from COVID-positive people and their close and casual contacts. The litany of issues included: Revelations WA Police accessed SafeWA data as part of criminal investigations sparked concerns over privacy — but did it amount to an unacceptable breach of trust? In one instance, WA Health allowed a contractor to access its data without monitoring who had accessed the sensitive information. The department's cloud-based COVID-19 information gathering system, known as Public Health COVID Unified System (PHOCUS), helps it harvest information for contact tracing. As well as SafeWA check-ins, the data has been collected from SmartRiders, CCTV footage, G2G passes, taxi and ride share services and business records. Personal medical information collected included pathology results, existing medical conditions and medications from people testing positive to COVID-19. Auditor-general Caroline Spencer said controls within the department needed to be strengthened to protect the confidentiality of personal information. ""I am concerned that the security and privacy of peoples' highly sensitive medical and personal information has not been protected to the extent the community has a right to expect,"" she said. She said WA did not have comprehensive privacy laws, and it was therefore especially important that the Health Department adequately protected the data it collected. ""Also concerning is that WA Health has told the community little about the types of personal and medical information [it] collects [about positive cases, close and casual contacts, and travellers] to support contact tracing, and that this information is stored indefinitely,"" she said. ""This lack of transparency can lead to unintended consequences, including erosion of trust in government institutions."" Curtin University internet studies professor Tama Leaver said the report exposed ""significant failings"" in the government's handling of personal data. He said the overarching issue was the lack of privacy laws in Western Australia. ""At the end of the day, the ongoing question is about us having proper privacy laws, which are applied before you set something up, not as an afterthought,"" Professor Leaver said. ""I don't think any of this data has been gathered illegally in the state, but I think that's because the state's laws are inefficient for looking after people's privacy."" Professor Leaver called for better transparency, given the sensitive nature of the data being stored. ""There's probably quite a few people that have had access to huge amounts of personal information that they could have been tempted to misuse in ways that that we will probably never know about,"" he said. ""The fact that there was no real safeguards put in place to prevent that happening is the problem. ""I think as a bare minimum, people have a right to transparency about what data about them is being collected, how long it's being kept, where it's being kept, and who has access to it."" The report made four recommendations to WA Health, including improving transparency to the community around the sources used to collect personal information and how it is used, as well as protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal medical information. WA Health has agreed to implement all of them. Director-general David Russell-Weisz defended the contact tracing system as ""one of the best systems in Australia, if not the world"". He credited the PHOCUS system with helping authorities contain the Delta outbreak among backpackers last Christmas. ""We welcome the auditor-general's findings … we have accepted the recommendations and indeed, many of the recommendations have been enacted during the past year,"" he said.

48,Labor says the Coalition has a plan to cut Medicare if re-elected. Is there any evidence?,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Spurious claims are appearing about what each major party would do in government should it win the election. This article is part of a series on scare campaigns: their origins, how they are being spread, and how the claims stack up against the stated commitments of the parties. Labor has ratcheted up its attack on the Coalition's record on Medicare, warning it could spell the end of the decades-old healthcare system should the Morrison government be re-elected. In a wide-reaching effort, Labor has clocked up millions of views on Facebook of advertisements prosecuting a number of claims. But how do they stack up? The term ""Mediscare"" has its origins in the 2016 election when Labor ran a highly successful campaign alleging the Coalition would privatise Medicare if elected. Despite losing the election, analysis by political scientists showed the issue dominated mainstream media,  raising healthcare as an issue among voters and lifting Labor's share of the vote – especially in marginal electorates. Led by Malcolm Turnbull, the Coalition's majority was cut sharply, giving it a wafer-thin margin in the House of Representatives with just 76 seats – the minimum required to form government outright. Three years later, in 2019, Labor under Bill Shorten would again campaign with the mantra  ""save Medicare"". ""This election is a referendum on the future of Medicare,"" Mr Shorten declared at Labor's official campaign launch. According to Nicholas Reece, a principal fellow in the Melbourne School of Government and former Labor Party strategist, the ""Mediscare"" campaign was effective because it played to a pre-existing belief in the electorate. This was because the Coalition had in 2014 reneged on a promise to meet a higher share of Medicare's rising cost. In 2016, it also proposed the outsourcing – or privatisation – of some Medicare payments. Labor reignited its campaigning on Medicare in June 2021 following the Coalition's announcement of a plan to reform the Medicare Benefits Schedule. As Shadow Treasuer Jim Chalmers put it via Twitter: ""If Scott Morrison is prepared to attack Medicare again before an election, just imagine what he'd do if the Liberals got another term."" Labor ramped up its messaging as the official election campaign got under way, attacking the Coalition's record on Medicare and warning of future cuts and even an end to the system altogether should the Coalition be re-elected. Advertising data published by Facebook's parent company, Meta, for one official ALP page, shows the extent of Labor's advertising reach. Meta estimates that over the past year, advertisements that either criticised the Coalition's record or warned that Medicare was under threat were viewed 5.6 million to 6.5 million times at an estimated cost of roughly $76,000 to $98,000. Labor's Medicare claims are wide ranging. Some are substantiated; for example, Labor's claim to being the architect of Medicare. Others, however, lack context or are simply incorrect. For example, Labor campaign spokesman and MP Jason Clare told a media conference on April 16: ""At four elections in a row, the Liberal Party has promised to scrap Medicare."" Fact Check was unable to find any evidence that ""scrapping Medicare"" was ever an election commitment of the Coalition. Equally, the characterisation of the election as a choice between ""Morrison or Medicare"", as suggested in Labor advertisements, is overblown. Following the Coalition's announcement that Anne Ruston would become Health Minister in a re-elected Morrison government, senior Labor MPs including Deputy Leader Richard Marles pointed to past comments by Senator Ruston as evidence of a Coalition plan to end bulk billing. ""Scott Morrison's hand-picked Health Minister Anne Ruston is on the record saying Medicare is unsustainable without co-payments and an end to bulk billing,"" a sponsored Facebook post reads. ""If Scott Morrison is re-elected, Australians will no longer have equal access to healthcare. Only Labor will strengthen Medicare."" While Senator Ruston, then a backbencher, did tell parliament in 2015 that ""Medicare in its current form is not sustainable"", the comments were in relation to a GP co-payment policy pursued by then prime minister Tony Abbott but later dumped. Senator Ruston has since confirmed she no longer supports the co-payment policy, nor is it Coalition policy. A key thread running through Labor's campaign material goes to the Coalition's record on Medicare; in particular, the rising cost of seeing a doctor. For example, an ALP Facebook advert asks: ""Did you know that under the Liberals, the cost of seeing a GP has rocketed up by 35 per cent?"" But as Fact Check has previously explained, Labor's claims in this space are misleading as they lack critical context. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese says it costs 34 per cent more to see the doctor today than when the Coalition came to power. RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. To begin with, by focusing on the change over the Coalition's entire term, Labor's numbers obscure an important factor – the naturally occurring rise in costs over time, which one expert put down to ""deeply structural and much more complex"" reasons than the actions of any one government. Fact Check reported that between September 2013 and March 2021, Department of Health data showed the average cost of visiting a GP rose by 38 per cent. However, this equated to an average of 4.3 per cent a year. Under the previous Labor government, the cost rose 8.9 per cent a year on average. Anthony Scott, a health economist with the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, told Fact Check: ""Though [the] cost might have increased under this government, it also increased under Labor."" Furthermore, Kees Van Gool, deputy director of the University of Technology Sydney's Centre for Health Economics Research and Evaluation, said that it was important to note that although average patient costs were rising, so too were bulk-billing rates. The rate has increased over the Coalition's term in office and stood at 88.7 per cent in December 2021. Health Minister Greg Hunt says that under the Coalition the proportion of people receiving GP services for free has increased to nearly 90 per cent. RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. That's not to say there aren't issues with Medicare when it comes to out-of-pocket medical expenses. As a recent Grattan Institute report found, a significant number of Australians miss out on essential medical care due to cost barriers. However, the report also noted that these costs were primarily concentrated in other areas of the healthcare system – most notably specialist care – with GP cost barriers, for the most part, remaining low. Another common theme throughout Labor's advertising is that the Coalition enacted 900 ""cuts"" to Medicare amid the pandemic. ""Who thinks making 900 cuts and changes to Medicare during a pandemic was a good idea? Yeah, us neither,"" a Labor Facebook advert reads. ""The Liberals made 900 cuts to Medicare,"" suggests another. But there's more to the story here, too. While it's true the Coalition did overhaul the Medicare Benefits Schedule, which lists Medicare services subsidised by the government, experts including Dr Susan Méndez, senior research fellow at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, argue the changes were necessary. ""Health is an area that is constantly evolving,"" she said in an email. ""New treatments, new procedures, new vaccines (e.g. COVID) are happening all the time and people should have access to innovative healthcare. ""This needs to be reflected in the way a system subsidises healthcare. The aim of the review [of the schedule], that was long overdue, was to remove obsolete (low-value, outdated) items and include new ones."" In fact, early evidence suggests the changes were overall ""cost neutral"", according to a recent paper published by the Melbourne Institute. ""We find no statistically significant effects on medical expenditures, the volume of care, or average fees charged."" Labor has made many claims about the Coalition's track record in managing Medicare, as well as the system's future under a re-elected  Morrison government. However, many of these claims are misleading or lack important context. The Coalition has not foreshadowed any major change to Medicare in its election campaign.

49,Meet the West Australians imposing COVID restrictions on themselves,health," Coronavirus While many in Western Australia are enjoying a much wider range of freedoms since COVID restrictions were lifted, some in the community are choosing to stay home. Many have sheltered away from public activities over the past two years due to fears of catching COVID-19. But with more than 80 per cent of West Australians triple-dose vaccinated, the state government has encouraged people to get back out into the public realm. While some have taken that advice, the fear of infection still lingers, especially amongst the older community. At the Morning Show at the Perth Town Hall, many expressed nervousness about going out. ""We always wear our masks. I think we're going to wear ours for a while yet,"" audience member Mary Redfern said. ""[We] just don't want to catch the virus. And I think you can if you're going to not wear a mask."" COVID numbers in WA are the highest they have ever been, with almost 90,000 current infections and daily infection rates hovering around 15,000. Ms Redfern has chosen to stay active by getting out of the house, but takes all the precautions she can when she's in public. But not everyone is willing to take that risk. This weekly show for seniors in the heart of Perth used to entertain crowds of up to 200. Despite venue capacity limits easing almost a month ago, attendance now hovers at little more than half that figure. Bernard Carney has hosted the Morning Show for more than two decades and said the buzz in the Perth Town Hall has not felt the same since the pandemic began. ""It's just that uncertain time. We haven't really got back to normal,"" he said. ""Sometimes families encourage them not to come because they're more likely to catch [COVID]."" Mr Carney said lining up performers had also been difficult as many had pulled out due to COVID infections or needing to isolate. ""The show gets cancelled or I have to book somebody else. Or I might have to do it myself,"" he said jokingly. Council on the Ageing WA CEO Christine Allen said while the general population may have gotten used to the idea of living with COVID, many in the older community have not. ""We've got more COVID cases than we've ever had. Since our borders opened, older people are concerned and they are choosing to stay at home,"" she said. Ms Allen urged West Australians to be compassionate when making decisions about wearing masks and social distancing. ""I don't know that it should be mandated that we all wear them, but certainly think of people who are at higher risk than you are,"" she said. Ms Allen said her mother was one of many older West Australians who have chosen to stay home. ""She is very frightened about going out into the community, and she feels that she may not survive if she gets COVID,"" she said. ""That's the reality for a lot of older people. They are vulnerable."" It's not just the CBD that seniors are avoiding. In the suburb of Beechboro, north-east of Perth, carpet bowlers have also seen their attendance struggle to recover. The gymnasium which houses a weekly tournament once filled with green bowling mats now only uses half the space. Bebe Flynn captains the Addie Mills Gosnells carpet bowls team, who all returned this week for the first time in half a year. ""I don't like admitting how old I am,"" Ms Flynn said, laughing. ""We haven't been here since November. We decided we'd give it a go again."" Ms Flynn said the summer heat was one reason for not participating in the competition until now, but the risk of infection also weighed heavily on their minds. So despite having decided to get her and the ""golden girls"" back out, the team donned masks as part of their uniform. ""I'd hate for any of my people to come down with COVID because I've taken them out bowling,"" she said. Jennifer Merigan runs a newspaper targeted at seniors, and says while numbers are yet to pick up, there is a hint of hope among the older community. ""People are starting to learn to live with COVID, and they're still wanting to head out and about,"" she said. ""We're finding a lot of our clubs and groups are getting back to doing activities."" Ms Merigan said enough seniors were getting out to warrant clubs recommencing activities that have been cancelled for the past two years. ""They're taking precautions, wearing masks. But they also know that the secret of life is getting out, and having a go,"" she said. But even among those willing to take that risk, an air of uncertainty remains as West Australians endure their first wave of COVID-19.

50,"Caesarean births not linked to food allergies during infancy, study finds",health,"  Caesarean births not linked to food allergies during infancy, study finds Babies born via a caesarean section operation are not more likely to develop a food allergy during infancy, according to new research. The Murdoch Children's Research Institute study of more than 2,000 infants found no difference in the prevalence of allergies depending on whether the birth was delivered vaginally or via caesarean. Of the children born via caesarean, 12.7 per cent had a food allergy compared with 13.2 per cent born vaginally. It also did not matter whether the caesarean was an emergency or planned, or if it occurred before or after the onset of labour. The same study also found 30 per cent of peanut allergies and 90 per cent of egg allergies were likely to naturally resolve themselves by the time a child turned six. Senior research officer at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Rachel Peters, said there had been a rise in both caesarean births and food allergies in the last decade or two, leading to the hypothesis that the two were linked. Also contributing to the hypothesis was that babies born via caesarean had a different microbial gut composition from those born vaginally — similarly to babies with food allergies. Associate Professor Peters said the findings would hopefully ease mothers' minds. ""I think these findings will help assist caregivers in evaluating the risks and benefits of a caesarean delivery, and also provide reassurance for mothers who need or choose to have such intervention that there's little evidence that their baby will be at an increased risk of food allergy,"" she said. Australia has one of the highest rates of food allergies in children in the world, Associate Professor Peters said, affecting one in 10 infants and one in 20 children over five. She said children with pet dogs and older siblings were less likely to develop food allergies given their increased exposure to microbes.

51,How many Australians have died from COVID-19? Can you get COVID twice?,health,"  COVID-19 infections in Australia hit worldwide highs last week, with infection rates per capita among the highest around the globe. As the United States officially reached the grim milestone of 1 million deaths from COVID-19 this month, the recent stats have left some of us asking — how does our own country stack up in comparison? Across Australia, 7,976 people have died from COVID-19 as of Friday, May 20. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have reached more than 6.5 million. Case numbers are heavily influenced by the rate of testing, and as such the true number of cases is likely to be higher than official counts. Australia's death toll by state Deaths Victoria New South Wales Queensland South Australia 415 Western Australia 210 Tasmania 69 ACT 60 Northern Territory Australia 7,976 *Data as of May 20, 2022. Note — two Queensland residents who died in NSW are included in the NSW tally. These deaths are currently counted in both Queensland and NSW health authority totals. Australia's elderly population has borne the brunt of COVID deaths, explains Professor Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University and leading researcher in public health. ""Omicron is impacting the over 80s now mostly, and particularly males,"" she said. Professor Bennett says the average age of death has risen since the Omicron wave began at the end of 2021. ""While males have always had a higher death rate than females across all age groups, there appears to be an even greater discrepancy over the past few months. The death rate per 100,000 people in those aged 80 and over are more than 400 for males and around 250 for females,"" she says. Some 15 million people died during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, between January 2020 and 31 December 2021,  according to estimates from the World Health Organization. WHO places the death toll at approximately 14.9 million by the end of 2021. This is about 2.7 times the toll officially reported to the UN agency, with the difference based on estimates of ""excess mortality"", which includes deaths missed by national reporting systems. The data tracking Australia's COVID-19 developments provide a guide to how the country is faring in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Clarity on this data is rather murky, explains Professor Adrian Esterman, a biostatistician at the University of South Australia. ""Australia doesn't do regular serology testing, so we have no idea what percentage of the population have had COVID-19. We also don't appear to collect reinfection data in any systematic way,"" he says. Professor Bennett also confirms there is limited data on reinfections. ""It's hard to say as we don't record all cases nor know how many are repeat infections of those that are reported."" If you’ve recently recovered from a bout of COVID-19 and you’re wondering if it's a ""one and done"" situation, sorry to say, it's possible to get Covid-19 two or more times. But there is limited data on reinfections. As the phrase ""learn to live with the virus"" becomes more common, people may think the worst of the pandemic is past. Professor Bennett suggests that currently, less than 50 per cent of infections are tested or reported in Australia. ""I estimate it could be under 40 per cent — but if we assume the actual infections are double the reported numbers, then that's over 13 million infections. ""And as some will be repeat infections, the number of infections won't be the same as the number of people infected … but it's probably not far off 50 per cent of the population [that are tested or reported]."" Figures show that young people in their twenties have recorded the highest numbers of infections, followed by people in their thirties and people in their teens, then followed by those in their forties. Young adults are more likely to work in high-risk settings, such as hospitals, supermarkets and hospitality. During the Delta outbreak, those aged under 40 — the age group made to wait the longest to become eligible for vaccination — made up two-thirds of confirmed cases. Just over 94 per cent of the total population are now eligible for vaccination against COVID-19. Eighty-four per cent of Australians have been vaccinated with two doses, as of May 19 data.

52,A 130 per cent jump in flu cases in Queensland has experts concerned,health,"  A surge in influenza cases in Queensland prompts doctors to issue vaccine warning for children and vulnerable groups Experts have sounded a warning about this year's flu season, with concerns young children will be particularly vulnerable to life-threatening complications. Queensland flu notifications for the year have skyrocketed in the past week, increasing from 1,848 to 4,282 — a jump of more than 130 per cent in seven days. Since the start of April, 457 people have been admitted to Queensland public hospitals with flu, including 30 who have required intensive care. Queensland Health data shows 180 people have been diagnosed with the double whammy of having COVID-19 and flu at the same time in 2022. Almost half of Queenslanders with so-called ""flurona"" have been aged between 10 and 29. Queensland Children's Hospital infectious disease physician Angela Berkhout said children aged two and under had low levels of natural immunity to flu as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 public health directions kept flu numbers down in 2020 and 2021, but they have already rebounded this year with the relaxation of restrictions and reopening of borders. Health Minister Yvette D'Ath says she is concerned about the ""life-threatening"" risk of Queenslanders being struck down with both viruses at once this winter. ""We can't be complacent,"" Dr Berkhout said. ""It is really important that this year … children are having their influenza vaccine."" Dr Berkhout said flu could be serious in children, with the virus capable of causing myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, and encephalitis — swelling of the brain. ""I don't want to be fear-mongering amongst parents, but very rarely there are some children who die from influenza,"" she said. ""People think: I've got a well child, they've got no underlying medical problems so my child will be fine. Unfortunately, it's unpredictable. ""We know that there are children who've been previously fit and healthy who unfortunately catch influenza and have severe disease and complications related to influenza."" University of Queensland virologist Ian Mackay said flu was not a ""trivial virus"". ""A proportion of infections are quite severe and quite serious and every year it kills people,"" he said. Dr Mackay said diagnosed flu cases across Queensland, as well as nationally, suggested the season could peak earlier than the usual August pinnacle. ""We've certainly got a much earlier rise and looking at the last five years, I would say it's a faster rate of rise than we've seen in any of the previous five years,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean it'll peak fast and drop fast. It might stay around for a while."" Chief Health Officer Dr John Gerrard, an infectious disease specialist, is yet to make flu shots mandatory for people visiting or working in residential aged care, as he has for COVID-19 vaccination. Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said yesterday she would be guided by Dr Gerrard on the issue but Dr Mackay said, ""flu vaccination should be essential for people going into vulnerable settings like that"". Flu shots are free for children aged from six months to less than five years, Australians aged 65 and older, pregnant women, First Nations people and those with certain medical risk factors, such as heart disease, severe asthma, chronic lung conditions and impaired immunity. But Ms D'Ath is so concerned about this year's flu season she plans to write to the Commonwealth asking for free flu jabs to be broadened. ""We are probably going to be experiencing our worst flu season that we have seen in almost a decade and it's coming at us quickly,"" she said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Queensland Health's Acting Chief Operating Officer David Rosengren, an emergency medicine specialist, said the state was already seeing a surge in the number of flu cases requiring hospital admission, including intensive care. ""The dominant strain of influenza this season is influenza A,"" Dr Rosengren said. ""Influenza A is a serious illness. It has serious impacts on our young and on our older and more frail people, particularly those with chronic disease. ""I saw a 19-year-old gent in the emergency department last Thursday night with influenza A who described never having felt so bad in his entire life. ""If you don't want to feel so bad in your entire life, then my challenge is to go out and get your flu vaccine. We know it works.""

53,"I've got COVID-19 symptoms, but a negative RAT, so how do I know if I'm testing properly?",health,"  Rapid antigen tests (RATs) have found their way into homes across the country, allowing us to test for COVID-19 and get the results minutes later. They’re easy to use and help expand the capacity of labs that process PCR tests, especially when they're under pressure to produce results quickly. While RATs are recognised to be less accurate than PCR tests, there are some steps you can take to make sure you get an accurate result when testing at home. You should take a RAT when you have symptoms of COVID-19  — fever, cough or losing your sense of taste or smell — according to Associate Professor Meru Sheel, an epidemiologist from the University of Sydney. ""With the rapid antigen test, what we do know is that they tend to work better for symptomatic people, not for asymptomatic people,"" Dr Sheel says. ""That’s to do with the ability to detect the viral antigen. The more viral antigen you have, the greater ability you have to [end up with] a positive rapid antigen test."" ""That doesn’t mean that an asymptomatic person may not test positive with a RAT, but the effectiveness is better for symptomatic people."" Most people develop symptoms five to six days after being in contact with a person who has active COVID-19. Preliminary research suggests cases can be infectious for two to three days before a RAT is able to detect the virus — SARS-CoV-2 — so waiting a couple of days before you test isn't a bad idea if you're isolating anyway. ""If somebody has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, I think it's a good idea to wait for symptoms to develop to use the rapid antigen test,"" Dr Sheel says. However, it's not entirely necessary to wait for symptoms to appear if you've had a known exposure, Dr Sheel suggests. RATs can detect COVID-19 in asymptomatic people, however, it's useful to remember that the higher the viral load, the better the test will work. ""If they’re a household contact and they are unwell and have not tested positive on a RAT test, it’s likely that their symptoms are mild and they’re not detecting the virus,"" Dr Sheel says. ""It’s better to get a PCR test for that reason but, if you’re symptomatic, you should be isolating anyway."" Dr Sheel says it’s better to test than not to test, but a PCR test would work better than a RAT to detect COVID-19 at an early stage. ""We know that PCR tests are the most sensitive and the most specific of those tests."" Australia's national drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved 47 different RATs for home use in Australia. Of the 47 tests, they have been categorised into three sensitivity levels. These include: All of the TGA-approved tests need to have a clinical sensitivity of at least 80 per cent and clinical specificity of at least 98 per cent. Higher sensitivity means there's less chance of a false negative result, while high specificity means there will be a lower rate of a false positive. As the specificity rate is at 98 per cent, it's not very common at all to get a false positive result from a RAT. If you buy tests online from overseas it's best to check that the RATs are approved by the TGA so that you know they provide an accurate result. It's highly unlikely. Even though our population immunity has changed, due to high vaccination rates and the number of people who have now had COVID-19, Dr Sheel says the tests can still detect the different strains of the virus. There are roughly 300,000 active COVID cases in Australia at any given time. So how will you vote if you test positive for the virus in election week? Not yet, but Dr Sheel says health professionals may soon have to start testing for multiple different pathogens as other respiratory illnesses such as influenza and rhinovirus start circulating this winter. ""There’s a lot of viruses circulating. I think we’ll learn more in the coming weeks and expect some more guidance around what that looks like."" Dr Sheel says multiple pathogen testing has been done in previous winters, but this will look different now that COVID-19 is in the picture. If you do have symptoms, no matter whether you think it's the common cold or not, you should isolate and take a RAT or PCR test. ""I think it’s a general rule that, if somebody is symptomatic with respiratory symptoms, they should be staying home and definitely not go to any high-risk settings."" There are specific rules when you're taking a RAT test to make sure you get an accurate result. The TGA says that, if you're going to take a saliva RAT, there's a number of things you can't do for up to 30 minutes beforehand, these include: With more brands of RAT tests expected to be sold in Australia, Dr Sheel says the most important thing you can do is read the instructions in the box and follow them properly. Each RAT test may have slightly different rules to a different brand. The tests also expire, many within 12 months, so if you've had some in your cupboard for a while, check the expiry date before you start. If you test positive on a RAT, you must immediately isolate and register your positive result to your state or territory health department. The rules for a positive case vary depending on where you live. Here's where you can find out exactly what you need to do: Registering your result gives you access to support from health care services while you're in isolation. Most governments require you to self-isolate for seven days and tell your household contacts that you've tested positive. RATs are a great way to get a quick indication of whether you've been exposed to COVID-19, but PCR tests produce the most reliable results. If you suspect you have COVID-19 because you've been exposed, or you have symptoms but keep testing negative on a RAT, a PCR test can give you a more accurate result, Dr Sheel says. A PCR test can detect COVID-19 before you're infectious, while a RAT can only detect when you're already infectious.

54,Would-be psychologists desperate for Australian uni spots forced to look overseas for alternatives,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Students are finding it easier to study psychology at top American universities such as Stanford than anywhere in Australia, according to the profession's peak body. The Australian Psychological Society (APS) said a lack of Commonwealth funding meant universities around the country were losing money for the very postgraduate degrees needed to boost the number of practitioners. APS President Tamara Cavenett said that, as a result, universities were being forced to offer limited spots in their programs, which was compounding the workforce shortage. ""Across the board, mental health has become increasingly in demand, and yet we're not seeing that correspond with the number of university places,"" she said. ""We're turning away hundreds of students every year, when we could be allowing them to complete their training."" One of the students being turned away is Nita Roschanzamir. She graduated from her undergraduate psychology degree three years ago, with honours, two scholarship offers and an average mark of 90 per cent. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Since then, Ms Roschanzamir has applied multiple times for several masters' degree programs in New South Wales but to no avail. ""It's just an incredibly frustrating experience,"" she said. ""In the midst of a mental health crisis in Australia, it would make sense to admit as many people as possible into the program."" She is now looking at schools overseas, rather than face the prospect of being rejected for another year. ""It's actually easier to get into Stanford than it is to get into Western Sydney University,"" she said. In Australia, you cannot become a registered psychologist without a masters' degree. However, after completing their undergraduate studies, students such as Nita are currently forced to compete for a handful of places in those postgraduate programs. Funding for those programs is split between Commonwealth subsidies and student tuition fees but, Ms Cavenett said, that did not come close to covering the costs of the courses. Demand has soared for youth mental health services during the pandemic, but a shortage of psychologists in regional areas means many young people are going without treatment. Like medicine, psychology masters' degrees are expensive to run, with low student-to-staff ratios, as well as high supervision and placement costs. However, postgraduate psychology training is currently funded at a lower band, compared to other health professions, with the Commonwealth chipping in just over $13,000 per student, compared to more than $27,000 for degrees such as vet science and agriculture. ""For psychology, they've budgeted on par with English literature,"" Ms Cavenett said. ""So that's despite the fact that we have incredible supervision costs, expensive testing costs, placement costs, you know, all these different things that make a course like psychology, especially at that advanced training level, harder to do and more expensive to produce."" With just days until the federal election, psychologists are calling on the major parties to increase funding for the courses, to help address the shortfall. The workforce shortage is so acute that one in three psychologists have had to close their books to new patients, compared to one in 100 before the pandemic. ""A quarter of our workforce is 55 or over, which means that we are going to start to see people retiring, without having a replacement workforce,"" Ms Cavenett said. ""I guess my biggest fear is whether or not my children are going to have access to the kind of health care that they could have, if we were supporting universities to produce these students, and tagging places and using the same strategies that work in medicine."" In a statement, a spokesperson for the Federal Labor campaign said it had announced additional university places targeted at areas of skills shortage, including within the health sector. While a Coalition campaign spokesman said it had invested almost $20 billion dollars in higher education this year, after providing for up to 30,000 more university places last year.

55,Intervention-era alcohol bans in remote communities are ending. What happens next? ,health,"  NT government passes liquor laws to replace Commonwealth Intervention-era alcohol bans in remote communities The Northern Territory government has passed legislation that could see the return of alcohol to some remote Aboriginal communities for the first time in 15 years. Long-term Commonwealth alcohol restrictions in dozens of communities the Northern Territory are set to end in July, unless there is a last-minute extension to the laws by the federal government. Consequently, the Territory government has introduced changes to local liquor laws giving communities the option to remain ‘dry’, or to introduce alcohol. Leading Indigenous groups have slammed the changes, arguing legislation is being rushed through by government without consultation. However, Territory minister Chansey Paech told parliament the government's hand was forced by the Coalition. ""It is walking away at the 11th hour, leaving our government to look after the Territory, bringing in measures to clean up its mess,"" he said. ""The Northern Territory government has been trying to get answers from the federal government about its plans for a long time, but we have heard nothing but crickets."" The federal government dismissed that account as irresponsible, and said it had been discussing the issue with the Territory government since at least October last year. ""In April, based on the conclusion of the review and following consultation, I accepted the NT Government's offer to transition the legislation,"" Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt wrote in a statement. ""The NT Government has not yet replied and it seems that on the eve of an election, they've chosen to play politics."" A federal Labor spokesperson said the party supports an end to the laws. The legislation is intended as a ""stopgap"" measure for when the Intervention-era alcohol bans, which have continued under federal Labor's 2012 Stronger Futures legislation, expire. A long taxi ride to the closest regional hub is not an uncommon expense for residents living in the remote community of Barunga, but that could soon be a cost of the past. When that happens, the NT government says more than 100 remote communities will revert back to alcohol restrictions that predate the 2007 laws. However, under the legislation, about 12 remote communities, more than 30 town camps and more than 200 homelands across the NT will be able to choose whether they want to access alcohol in their communities. The Country Liberal Party opposition, as well as an independent member of parliament Robyn Lambley, attacked the proposal before it passed parliament on Tuesday night. ""Open the floodgates and rivers of grog and suddenly there is no restriction on the amount they can drink and where they can drink it,"" she said. ""Horrific. I am concerned about the potential of what the government is proposing here."" The communities that opt into restrictions will only have them for a two-year period, while their long-term plans for alcohol are discussed. ""This government will not support continuing the mandatory restrictions and obligations of the Intervention,"" Chief Minister Natasha Fyles said in a statement. ""This Bill empowers affected communities with a choice to decide what is best for their community, and we will continue to support them in making that choice."" The Territory government has not yet specifically named the communities affected by the legislation. Leading Indigenous and alcohol-related harm reduction groups have written to the government, arguing the changes have been hastily passed, and the consultation poor. ""We are particularly concerned by the lack of opportunity for consultation with, and contribution from, those who could be most adversely [affected] by the changes,"" a letter signed by eight organisations sent to the Chief Minister said. ""Especially female and minor residents and the elderly, as well as community staff and service providers."" Mr Paech, an Indigenous man whose vast electorate of Gwoja covers many remote communities, told parliament anyone who thought existing bans were completely effective was living in a ""utopian world"". Federal alcohol bans in Northern Territory Aboriginal communities are set to expire at the end of June. He said the restrictions increased problematic behaviours like expensive black market sales and harmful alternatives like mouthwash and sanitiser. ""Territorians who live in urban centres enjoy the luxury of going home each night and pouring themselves a glass of wine,"" he said. ""This privilege was not afforded to Territorians who live in remote communities and town camps under the Intervention and Stronger Futures. ""The inequity is what frustrates me the most; that people in towns and urban centres can still look down on Aboriginal people in the bush and say: 'I know what is best for you'."" Since it came to power in 2016, the NT government has implemented several measures targeting problem drinking, including a banned drinkers register and a minimum unit price for takeaway alcohol.

56,'I wish I could exchange my life for his': Jet ski rider who killed teenager delivers tearful apology to family,health,"  Jet ski rider who killed boy at Blanchetown 'immeasurably sorry' for incident A man charged with riding a jet ski that hit and killed a teenager on the Murray River in December has given a tearful apology in a South Australian court. Cooper Henke, 14, of Roxby Downs, was in the water at Murbko, near Blanchetown, on December 16, about 2:20pm when he was hit. He was pulled unconscious from the water and died at the scene in front of his horrified family. Another boy suffered minor injuries. A visibly shaking Daniel Patrick Liddell offered a full apology to the families of his victims in the District Court on Wednesday. He had already pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving in February. ""There is little I can say; nothing I can do to take back what I've done,"" Liddell said. ""I'm immeasurably sorry for what I've done and the grief and trauma that I've caused to the families. ""I wish I could take back that day and I wish I could exchange my life for his. ""No family should ever have to endure the pain that I've caused. ""I deserve to be punished and I will never forgive myself for what I've done; I'm sincerely sorry."" Liddell's lawyer, James Caldicott, said his client had problems with alcohol and then methamphetamine after his father died in 2008. In more recent times, he had used drugs recreationally and had spoken to his doctor about going into drug treatment programs. Mr Caldicott said his client had been on a heavy night of drinking with friends the night before the accident, then had more to drink the next morning, as well as 'two puffs' on a methamphetamine pipe to moderate his hangover. He had asked the owner of the jet ski if he could have a go, was shown how to operate it and went on to complete a number of turns or ""doughnuts"" on the jet ski. He said the 44-year-old was unsure what happened in a 'split second' when he hit Cooper, but conceded it was reckless behaviour. He had a blood alcohol reading of 0.08 at the time of the accident, which is over the legal limit. Mr Caldicott pleaded for leniency through home detention or a suspended sentence given Liddell had remained at the scene, pleaded guilty and was of good character. ""Mr Liddell seeks an opportunity to remain in the community, to remain a productive member of that community and to be a supportive parent to his own daughter,"" Mr Caldicott said. ""He is not a bad person, but someone who made an incredibly poor decision that resulted in terrible consequences."" Mr Caldicott said a doctor's report showed that Liddell now had an acute stress disorder and had been prescribed anti-depressants. Prosecutor James Slocombe said he did not know if Cooper's family would accept Riddell's apology. ""Whatever the defendant's activities in the river were on that morning, he had no business skylarking around the river where children were operating, playing with a boat with paddles,"" he said. ""A custodial sentence is required — we say this irrespective of the defendant's lack of prior history."" Liddell is eligible for a 25 per cent reduction in his penalty for pleading guilty. He will be sentenced next month. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

57,West Australian government sends crack team to St John after lives lost amidst ambulance delays,health,"  Firefighters, police and government officials will be sent to bolster the ranks at St John WA as it tries to cope with huge staff shortages due to COVID-19. Senior police and health department officials will be embedded in the embattled ambulance service, while 48 firefighters will receive training in how to operate ambulances and work with paramedics. St John CEO Michelle Fyfe welcomed the extra help but warned it was ""not a silver"" bullet and would not solve all problems. Premier Mark McGowan said two senior WA Police officers and two Health Department officers, including a senior doctor, would work at St John's headquarters from Thursday. It comes amidst significant staff furloughing in the ambulance service and in the wake of an elderly woman's death on Sunday while waiting for an ambulance. Georgina Wild waited more than two hours for an ambulance on Sunday morning, despite reporting of chest pain which should have seen an ambulance attend within 15 minutes. On that morning St John was experiencing a 40 per cent shortfall of staff, largely due to COVID-19, with the number of ambulances active in the metropolitan area reduced from 40 to 24. The incident is being investigated but has been labelled as ""unacceptable"" by Mr McGowan. The Premier said St John could have activated a COVID-plan to have firefighters drive ambulances, but it did not. Mr McGowan said the new staff seconded to St John would be tasked with making sure it took such measures when needed. ""They are specifically being tasked by the government to access more resources across government and activate the COVID plan that was put in place with St John in 2020,"" he said. Premier Mark McGowan says WA's ambulance service could have asked the Department of Fire and Emergency Services for help on the night Georgina Wild died. ""That will be their role, to work in conjunction with the management of St John, to access additional resources and fix some of the issues that have caused some of these problems. ""They had the COVID plan available, they didn't request the assistance. ""What we are now going to do is make sure we have personnel there who can work with St John senior management to get additional resources in when they need it."" Mr McGowan said firefighters were highly trained in first aid and in driving heavy vehicles, and it would be sensible to see them paired with a paramedic as a driver while staff levels were low. Ms Wild was the third woman to die in a month after issues with the ambulance service, following the deaths of a Geraldton woman while waiting for an ambulance, and a Busselton woman who was in the care of paramedics when she died after waiting three hours for treatment. Record ambulance ramping over the last few months has also slashed the number of hours ambulances are spending on the roads. However, Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said delays to ambulance response times on Sunday, when Ms Wild died, were not the result of ramping. ""The issue that was challenging the ambulance service was furlough and lack of staff available to actually get in the ambulances and drive them,"" she said. Ms Sanderson said there would be more multi-agency support to prevent such a situation being repeated in future. ""Where there is intense pressure you'll already have police there, you'll already have one of the state incident controllers there, who can reach out to DFES and police to provide assistance, or an alternative,"" she said. ""What should happen is that St John need to activate every part of their business continuity plan, which involves very experienced emergency professionals to be able to assist them, and to be able to be flexible in actually attending those jobs. ""What should have happened on Sunday is an alternative should have been provided if they were not able to send an ambulance."" Liberal Party leader David Honey said the state's hospitals and levels of ambulance ramping were in crisis but he welcomed the measures to provide more support to St John. ""I've only had a small chance to look at those, but they seem like they are sensible measures, and what we want to see from the government is cooperation with St John, not standing back and being critical of them,"" he said. ""St John Ambulance are responsible for saving tens of thousands of lives over the years, they provide an outstanding service."" Mr Honey also accused the government of having a ""union-supported"" intention to make the ambulance service a government service. A parliamentary inquiry is expected to report this week on whether ambulance services should be taken back into the public sector. ""We're investigating what further involvement the government can have in these issues and what further management we can put in place to ensure better performance by our ambulance service,"" Mr McGowan said yesterday. St John chief executive Michelle Fyfe said she looked forward to WA Health getting a closer look at the impacts of ambulance ramping. ""We welcome the Premier clearing the path for us to be able to cooperate with our emergency services partners and with the Department of Health as we tackle one of the most difficult times in our history,"" she said. ""We welcome the opportunity to have the Deputy Chief Health Officer come inside of our organisation and have a look and understand exactly the impact of a stressed health system, and extended transfer of care or ramping, and the impact that has on frontline service delivery for ambulance. ""And we look forward to working with him on solutions to that."" But she denied St John was being ""taken over"" by government, health, or police, and she fended off questions about whether she should resign over recent difficulties. ""The hardest part, sometimes, of being a leader is actually having to make difficult decisions,"" she said. ""But I am the leader of this organisation, I have been part of emergency services for nearly 40 years, and I don't turn my back when things get difficult."" Ms Fyfe said she trusted all her staff and would support them ""100 per cent"" during what continued to be a difficult period.

58,Karen tried to seek help for her sexual assault. She was turned away repeatedly by clinics that were too busy,health,"  Sexual assault support services struggling to cope with record demand Sexually violent crime has increased by 110 per cent in the past 25 years, yet specialised counselling services say they are unable to meet the demand. ABC's 7.30 has obtained exclusive access to waitlists of sexual assault clinics across the country, showing that wait times can be up to a year and a half. In New South Wales, the clinic at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney has a waitlist of between six and 12 months, while Westmead Hospital in Sydney's west currently has an eight-month waitlist. It's a six-to-nine-month wait for the service at Toowoomba, and one and a half years for some counselling programs at Laurel Place on the Sunshine Coast. Specialised sexual assault services across Tasmania have 140 people on waitlists and, over in Western Australia, the Allambee sexual assault service has a six-to-nine-month waitlist. Allambee Counselling chief executive Nicole Lambert told 7.30 she and her team felt guilty about the long wait times. ""We're saying [to victim-survivors]: 'Speak out, hope is there for you'. But, actually, it's not,"" she said. ""We are setting up an unrealistic expectation around the support that we're able to provide."" The West Australian government is reforming its policies on sexual violence to address the crippling shortages. Ms Lambert says she is hopeful this process will result with better outcomes for victim-survivors, where they have timely access to specialist services across all parts of the state. During its investigation, 7.30 has found a number of ""black spots"" around the country, where sexual assault support services are usually non-existent. They include: The chief executive of the national sexual assault service Full Stop Australia, Hayley Foster, has called for a commitment from all political parties to immediately rectify the crippling shortages in her sector. ""We absolutely need an investigation into those black spots across the country and those severe shortfalls [in] sexual assault [support] funding,"" Ms Foster said. The Federal Minister for Women's Safety, Anne Ruston, said in a statement that the government was establishing a Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commission to deliver better results for victim-survivors. Karen Iles was a happy and motivated teenager when she went on a family beach holiday almost three decades ago. She said it was then that a notorious gang sexually assaulted her on multiple occasions. ""I was 14, so I was in Year 8 of high school. I was still a child,"" she told 7.30. Even now, Ms Iles says, she hasn't been able to recover from this trauma. ""At the time when I was raped, my whole sense of self, my whole identity was just stripped bare from me,"" she said. ""It's unspeakable, the amount of trauma."" Recently, Ms Iles decided she would finally get help. She said that, in 2018, she was turned away by a specialised sexual assault clinic attached to a local hospital in Sydney. ""I was then left to my own devices. Somehow, I pulled myself through,"" she said. In 2021, Ms Iles said she again contacted a clinic at another Sydney-based hospital and was put on a 12-month waitlist. Ms Iles said she even contacted a private specialised service, but its waitlist was just as long. ""I'm still on both waitlists,"" Ms Iles said. After being turned away three times, Ms Iles ended up getting counselling from a fourth clinic at another NSW-based hospital. However, she says, it was a combination of luck and persistence to access the support she so desperately needed. ""I live in Sydney. Imagine women who live in regional areas or very remote areas. Their ability to access services must be absolutely shocking,"" she said. ""There has to be something done about it, and that's why I'm speaking out today."" As a previous manager of a sexual assault service in New South Wales, Tara Hunter said it was crucial that victim-survivors got the help they needed when they reached out to a specialist clinic. ""It takes bravery and courage to step forward,"" she said. ""It's really important that we acknowledge that that person has a human right to access the appropriate support."" Ms Hunter — who is director of clinical and client services for Full Stop Australia — says services across the country are buckling under the pressure, due to an exponential increase in reports of sexual assaults. She said that, as a result, services prioritise helping people who contact them within seven days of their alleged assault, young people or people with pre-existing mental health problems. Those who come forward with historic allegations are usually triaged to the bottom of the waitlist. However, Ms Hunter says, this can be damaging to the mental health of those seeking help. ""If we're not available to that person, then it reinforces those messages that, 'Actually what happened to me is not a big deal. I'll just manage it by myself, I'll be OK',"" she said. ""And what we know is that lots of people aren't OK."" The sexual assault hotline operated by Full Stop Australia has obtained statistics showing that its counsellors are unable to respond to one out of three callers. ""We can't rest while we have areas across the country, and people who are impacted by sexual violence cannot even access a single service,"" Ms Foster said. ""It is incredibly urgent."" A spokesperson from the office of the NSW Minister for Women's Safety, Natalie Ward, told 7.30 that, in 2020-21, Full Stop Australia received $1,546,500 in funding for the Sexual Violence Helpline and that an additional $20 million of Commonwealth funding had been invested in domestic and family violence services in NSW. The Queensland government said in a statement that it had increased funding to specialist sexual assault services since 2015 by more than 95 per cent. Communities Tasmania told 7.30 that, in 2021-22, the state's sexual violence services received funding of $4.16 million to support victims of sexual violence. The Women's and Children's Health Network in South Australia said 50 per cent of patients are seen within two weeks, and no patient will wait more than six weeks for an appointment. In a statement, the ACT government said that it acknowledged that the demand for sexual assault services is high and that the Canberra Rape Crisis Centre and other frontline services received an increase in funding in the 2021-22 budget to reflect increasing levels of demand.

59,'The worst we have ever seen': This emergency doctor says Queensland hospital bed shortage is 'dangerous',health,"  Queensland's Health Minister has admitted the state's hospital system is struggling to cope with demand, and fears the coming flu season could exacerbate the problem. In recent weeks, the state's health sector has faced repeated criticism from the Opposition and doctors over ambulance ramping and hospital wait times. Australasian College for Emergency Medicine's Queensland deputy chair Shantha Raghwan described the situation as ""dire"" and ""dangerous"". ""Access block is a huge issue and we have been talking about it for decades,"" Dr Raghwan said. Access block occurs when a patient is admitted to a hospital from the emergency department but cannot leave the emergency department due to a lack of inpatient hospital beds. ""At the moment, it is the worst we have ever seen. It is just awful. It is not safe and it is not fair, it is not safe on our staff and it is certainly not fair on the community,"" Dr Raghwan said. ""Really it is a mismatch between resources and we have the services that are required by the community at the moment."" Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said the problem was driven ""by other factors that we cannot control"", including the COVID-19 pandemic and failings in the aged care sector. ""When you can't afford private health insurance, when you can't get into private specialists, when you cannot access GPs, when you cannot get an NDIS package, when you cannot get the support you need in aged care you turn to the public health system,"" she said. ""We have 520 long-stay patients who do not require medical care in our hospitals today who need an NDIS or aged care package. ""We have another 462 patients in our public hospital beds with COVID and an additional 49 patients in private."" Ms D'Ath said more than 1,600 health staff were also isolating due to COVID. Queensland Health's acting chief operating officer Dr David Rosengren said he expected the flu season could further increase demand on hospitals. He said the state had seen a surge in influenza cases over the ""last couple of weeks"", including an increase in people admitted to intensive care with the illness. ""We are worried … we haven't had a flu season in Queensland for a couple of years,"" he said. ""Don't contribute to the burden of demand on our emergency departments by finding yourself in the back of an ambulance being transported to a hospital because you haven't found the time or effort to get a flu vaccine."" Opposition Leader David Crisafulli said the state's health system was in crisis ""long before"" COVID and that immediate action was required. ""COVID was that added pressure on the health system but it's been over half a decade in decline and we have now reached the situation where experts are telling patients and staff to come forward and tell their stories. ""We absolutely need more resources … more beds, more doctors, more nurses."" He called on the Queensland government to release ""real-time"" hospital data. AMAQ president Chris Perry said the hospital overcrowding was a product of chronic underfunding rather than the pandemic. ""There's 9 per cent of gross domestic product being spent on health and it's been like that for 40 years,"" he said. ""We're very disappointed with the health policies of both major parties. ""Both sides of the house in both levels of parliament of Australia have been shooting the messenger: it is all doctors' fault, somebody else's fault, it is never them. ""We need somewhere between $20 billion and $30 billion in the forward estimates to get our hospitals in Australia back to the level that we need. ""We need to increase the [Medicare] rebates so that GPs can stay afloat. ""We have inadequate beds … it's got nothing to do with low-grade COVID cases crowding accident and emergency wards."" Ms D'Ath said the state had delivered ""consecutive record health budgets"" but needed more funding from the federal government to improve hospital performance. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""This is not about shifting responsibility it's about sharing responsibility, and it's not about politics,"" she said. ""We need investment and Commonwealth health funding in aged care, in NDIS, in private health insurance and we need more support for GPs."" Mr Crisafulli agreed Queensland needed ""more from the Commonwealth"" but said the state government needed to act. ""That involves working with Canberra for more money, but it also involves fixing the things you are accountable for,"" he said. ""Start by sharing data in real time … start by putting doctors and nurses back in charge, look at the way you triage in the ED.""

60,All Tasmanian COVID-19 density and capacity restrictions to be scrapped,health,"  Tasmania will do away with density and capacity limits from all settings come midnight this Friday. The one person per 2 square-metre rule will no longer remain in place and all venues and events can operate at pre-COVID capacity, although some may opt to keep restrictions in place as part of their COVID safety plans. ""From pubs and theatres to stadiums to festivals, there will be no limitations on the number of people that can attend,"" Premier Jeremy Rockliff said. ""The number of daily positive cases has stabilised over the past month after cases peaked in April."" The Premier said mask requirements in some settings would remain, but ""we'll have more to say in the coming weeks"". ""While we are sensibly stepping down restrictions, it does not mean we lose COVID-safe behaviours,"" he said. ""This is everyone's responsibility. Please continue to practice good hand hygiene, follow social distancing, test when you have symptoms, stay home when you're unwell, wear masks where they're required in high risks settings or if you choose to do so."" Mr Rockliff reminded Tasmanians to continue to get vaccinated and keep up with their boosters. According to Public Health, Tasmanian has a rolling seven-day average of cases of 1,007, which has remained stable for the past six to eight weeks. On average, Tasmania is still seeing around one death a day. Take a look at the latest snapshot of COVID-19 data from Tasmania. Deputy Director of Public Health Julie Graham acknowledged the rising case numbers in other parts of the country but said it was Tasmania's stable case numbers and hospital admissions that allowed public health to review its advice. ""We're likely to continue to see this pattern of rising and falling case numbers as we potentially see new variants in the community, [as] our immunity waxes and wanes depending on our vaccination coverage, people's behaviours change … and we're increasing in our mixing,"" she said. ""We are still under the death rates for other states and territories, certainly any death is concerning, and we really want to promote those who are at risk for severe disease — your best defence is to be vaccinated."" Dr Graham said there might still be premises that continue to keep restrictions in place. ""Businesses may continue to restrict the number of people coming into their premises as part of their COVID safety risk assessment and plans, they would like to continue to protect their staff. ""The events will still be required to practice COVID-safe behaviours, public health will require big events over 5,000 and music events over 2,000 to submit a COVID safety plan to the government."" She also used the opportunity to urge Tasmania to get vaccinated against the flu. ""We are lucky in Tasmania, in that we often get a forewarning … this allows us to really push the message that your COVID safety behaviours are going to your influenza-safe behaviours,"" she said. There are rising numbers of influenza cases across Australia. There have been 17,764 notifications of the illness across the country, including Tasmania. Tasmanian Health Department Secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks echoed the need for people to be vaccinated, saying while 98 per cent of eligible Tasmanians had two doses, it did not mean the job was finished. ""That is not enough to keep us protected through winter and to stop increasing hospitalisation levels or death,"" she said. ""You need to have your third or your booster dose if you're due, or your fourth winter dose if you fall into the age or medical groups that actually require it."" Around 130,000 Tasmanians 16 and older still have not had their third dose of the vaccine, and more than 120,000 who qualify for fourth doses have not had one. Mr Rockliff has recently emerged from isolation after coming down with COVID and said he was fortunate enough to not have ""severe symptoms"". ""I feel good, I'm not quite as relaxed as former premier Peter Gutwein [who recently quit politics] … I'm really ready willing and able, back in action,"" he said.

61,Premier warns 'winter is coming' as WA COVID spike hits federal election polling stations,health,"  COVID-related labour shortages are set to impact Saturday's federal election, as Western Australia records another 16,253 infections — the third-highest daily figure since the pandemic began. After impacting almost half of St John WA's workforce and placing the state's hospitals under unprecedented pressure, the virus has now also hit the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). It has prompted Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers to warn that not all planned polling places will be operational in WA, with the electorates of Durack and O'Connor hardest hit. Mr Rogers said the difficulties come despite the commission's best efforts. ""Short of handing out blank cheques for work or accommodating thousands of single-day workers in interstate locations, there is not much more we could have done so far,"" he said. ""We're calling on other organisations to assist as a final push, and investigating all possible staffing models including amalgamating venues."" Mr Rogers said the commission was engaging with local residents in the hope they'll put their hand up. ""For some people it may mean that if you want to vote at a polling place in your town on election day, you may have to sign up to work as well."" In WA there are 26 localities or suburbs affected, including many in regional areas like Paraburdoo, Hopetoun, Coolgardie, and Norseman. The list is expected to become smaller as the week goes on, and those interested in helping out can find more information here. Despite today's high daily caseload, active cases in the state have fallen slightly from 88,710 to 88,100. The latest statistics also show three more deaths of people with COVID-19. The total number of patients in West Australian hospitals with the virus has grown by two to 327, with 12 in intensive care. Western Australia's peak day for new infections so far remains last Wednesday, when 17,033 cases were recorded. Premier Mark McGowan acknowledged while hospitalisations for COVID remained low in WA, the high case numbers were having a huge impact on the workforce. But he said it was a difficult situation to avoid and was likely better that it hit now than at the height of winter. ""It's a very complex set of circumstances, but the most significant thing is we have very high vaccination rates, which is reducing our hospitalisation and intensive care rates,"" he said. ""[That means] we don't have those death rates and those terrible outcomes the other states and other countries around the world have endured. ""But at the same time, vaccines wane over time and winter is coming. ""It's far better to have the situation that we're experiencing now, rather than in July when you have more waning of the vaccine efficacy and a great many more people enduring the consequences of a cold winter."" Mr McGowan said one of the greatest impacts of the high level of cases in WA was on the number of hospital and ambulance staff off sick. For the first time in its history, St John is warning Perth residents of extremely high demand for its services amid escalating COVID numbers. ""That's difficult to avoid at this point in time because we don't want COVID positive people spreading the virus more in workplaces and potentially putting pressure on our hospital system,"" he said. ""Trying to strike the right balance, it's not easy, but there are very few ways of avoiding the situation we are currently in, particularly as vaccines wane and particularly as we approach winter."" Mr McGowan has continued to resist calls from peak medical groups to reintroduce restrictions like the mask mandate as hospitalisation figures remain above 300. He said he expected to provide an update later today in relation to the death of a Perth woman who waited more than two hours for an ambulance on Sunday morning. ""Hopefully, we'll have more to say about the St John Ambulance issue later today, but I just want to reiterate how awful it was for Georgina Wild and her family, and we're very sorry that this has occurred,"" he said. Yesterday, Mr McGowan said despite ambulance staffing levels being down 40 per cent at the time, the situation was ""not acceptable"". Mr McGowan's comments came as the state government, with support from Lotterywest, made available $1.65 million in grants for sport and recreation clubs to implement COVID-safe measures. Clubs that have a physical facility such as clubrooms can apply for a one-off $2,000 grant, while clubs without facilities are eligible for a $500 payment. The COVID-19 cleaning subsidy can be used for purposes such as buying cleaning products, hiring cleaners, purchasing hand sanitiser, face masks and rapid antigen tests, or for printing signs. ""We understand many of these clubs may not have budgeted for additional costs associated with clubroom and equipment cleaning, and personal hygiene support for volunteers,"" Sports Minister David Templeman said. The deadline to apply for the grants is May 30. Meanwhile, three drive-through sites have opened in Perth for close contacts of COVID-19 cases to collect 10 free rapid antigen tests. The sites are in Joondalup, Jandakot and Bassendean. Close contacts collecting the free RATs must wear a mask and are only required to verbally confirm they are a close contact.

62,SA government rejects 'dark age dictatorship' claim about proposed COVID-19 laws,health,"  South Australia's Premier Peter Malinauskas has laughed off an opposition accusation that his government is attempting to impose emergency COVID-19 powers more suited to a ""Dark-Age dictatorship"". Yesterday the government announced it had secured the numbers in parliament to guarantee passage of new laws designed to handle South Australia's ongoing COVID-19 management, after deals with the Greens and SA Best. The  changes would see maximum penalties of two years in jail, or a $20,000 fine, for individuals who fail to comply with directions. For a business, the fine jumps to $75,000. Opposition Leader David Speirs today hit out at what he described as excessive powers unsuited to pandemic policing in a changed COVID-19 environment. ""What we're seeing from Peter Malinauskas here is a Dark-Age dictatorship tantamount to something that you would expect to see in Victoria under Dan Andrews. South Australia is more progressive than that,"" he said. ""We want to have a different approach, so the Liberal opposition will be tabling these amendments, making sure they're debated and giving the Legislative Council the chance to have their say and vote on an alternative approach."" The Liberal Party has proposed several amendments to the bill, including removing the option of jail time as a penalty, and reducing fines by about a third. ""We still think there is still a great opportunity here for Peter Malinauskas to step back from some of the more draconian measures within this proposed legislation,"" Mr Speirs said. ""It is our firm view that jail time is not necessary in the new season, the new era of COVID that we've been living with now for several months."" Mr Speirs made reference to the notorious Loverboy nightclub court case, in which a 19-year-old man who claimed he did not see his positive COVID-19 test result until after he went clubbing was fined $600 but spared conviction. ""He undertook his very irresponsible behaviour in a different season, a different time of COVID, when we were still keeping things very locked down to ensure that we were lifting the vaccination rate and keeping South Australians as safe as possible,"" Mr Speirs said. ""I also note that the court didn't go anywhere near a jail sentence with him and felt that a financial penalty was more appropriate. ""These penalties were absolutely appropriate in a really scary, uncertain time. ""As we transition to this new normal … should we have the threat of jail time hanging over the head of businesses, of individuals, of people who hold directorships in hospitality venues? We simply don't believe so."" When asked about the Opposition Leader's comments, and his reference to dictatorial powers, Premier Peter Malinauskas scoffed, saying the analogy ""smacks of desperation"". Mr Malinauskas accused Mr Speirs of trying ""to throw in a bunch of inflammatory language"" at what he described as ""an appropriate set of changes"". ""What we want to do is come out of the Emergency Management Declaration that's been in place now for over two years, where we've had one person in South Australia be able to make any direction without any oversight,"" the Premier said. ""At some point, we have to move away from a situation where one person in the form of the state coordinator has an extraordinary amount of authority. ""In many ways, it's the complete opposite of what Mr Speirs has been suggesting."" Mr Malinauskas said the new laws were necessary to provide a legal framework to ensure those who recklessly put others at risk of COVID-19 were subjected to due punishment. ""If you're COVID-positive and you know it, and you go to an aged care facility — which you know you're not supposed to go to — and you put people's lives in danger, then we do think an appropriate penalty needs to be applied,"" he said. ""Thus far, where courts have made judgements around allegedly very egregious breaches of restrictions, many people have said they've had too light a hand, that courts have been too soft. ""What we want to do is put in place the legislative framework to provide both police and the courts the options that they need to be able to issue an appropriate punishment."" Meanwhile, a legal challenge to a key element of South Australia's outgoing COVID-19 emergency measures is set to continue, after an option to settle the case was declined today in the Supreme Court. AFLW player Deni Varnhagen and another nurse — who lost their jobs because of the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers — are seeking judicial review of an earlier state government decision to extend the state of emergency which has kept the mandate in place. Earlier this morning, Ms Varnhagen's lawyer sought assurances that, if the trial continued and she lost, she would not be subject to aggravated court costs at a time when changes to the state's COVID regime were imminent, rendering Ms Varnhagen's case moot. But the government's counsel said the court could not speculate on the outcome of parliamentary processes, and would not criticise Ms Varnhagen if she continued with her trial. South Australia today recorded another 4,072 cases and another six deaths of people with COVID-19. The six people to die with the virus were all men, ranging in age from their 50s to their 90s. There are currently 247 people with COVID-19 in hospital, including 10 in intensive care and one on a ventilator. The daily number of new cases is up by almost 300 on yesterday's figure, but coincides with a 34 per cent increase in PCR testing. There are currently 25,911 known active cases in the state.

64,Spike in COVID-19 and flu outbreaks leave some schools having to return to remote learning,health,"  Victoria's Education Minister has ruled out a widespread return to remote learning as schools deal with unprecedented staff shortages related to COVID-19 and flu outbreaks. Victoria has recorded 22 deaths from COVID-19 and 14,220 new cases of the virus. The state has been recording more than 10,000 new COVID-19 cases per day for the past ten days, while influenza cases have also spiked. Schools are reporting difficulties finding relief teachers, but Education Minister James Merlino said only one government school had been forced to close its doors to students. ""Today, there is one year level at one school where the students are learning from home for a short period of time as that school deals with some staffing pressures,"" he said. ""We've got schools open, they continue to remain open throughout term one and term two. Yes, there are staffing challenges, of course there are. ""We've committed to opening schools and keeping them open and that's exactly what we've delivered as that is of highest benefit to our kids."" The staff shortages and student illnesses were not just affecting schools in the public system. Mr Merlino confirmed a Victorian private school in Shepparton had also been forced to return to some remote learning. Principal of Caroline Chisholm Catholic College in Melbourne's west, Robert Brennan, said the absentee rate at his school was double what it normally is, and 28 teachers were also sidelined. Mr Brennan said 15 staff had COVID, and seven had flu. ""We got in eight CRTs [casual relief teachers], but that only covers 32 of the 83 periods needing to be covered,"" he said. ""So, that means the staff on-site need to cover 53 of those periods and while it can be done on a single day, to continue to do that over a full week, it's near-on impossible."" Mr Brennan said he believed the workload of teachers was contributing to illness, on top of COVID-19 infections. ""The load teachers are willingly picking up to cover their colleagues and to ensure to kids education continues as normal as possible has been extraordinary and it's taking its toll,"" he said. Jo Roche, the acting principal of Merri River School, a specialist school in Warrnambool, said one day last week 16 out of the school's 85 staff were away sick with either COVID-19 or the flu. ""We are definitely experiencing a huge amount of staff away. We've been trying to cover it the best we can and I've been jumping in myself [to teach],"" she said. Ms Roche said the school had managed the shortages so far by combining classes. She said the fact many students were ill and absent had also helped ease pressure on the teachers and educational support staff. She said she had heard many other schools were in a similar situation. ""Everyone's in the same boat and it's just really important for everyone to be kind to one another,"" she said. Teachers and students who test positive to COVID-19 are required to isolate for seven days, but close contacts are not required to isolate if they do not have symptoms. The Victorian government removed the requirement for students in years 3 to 6 to wear masks in the classroom at the start of term two in April. The Education Department has been rolling out air purifiers for use in classrooms, and schools have been encouraged to maximise the use of outdoor areas for teaching. The department said more air purifiers were expected to be delivered to schools by June 1. Rapid antigen tests are also being distributed to students, and the free RAT scheme is due to continue for the rest of the term. Despite the staff shortages, some experts argue a return to remote learning is not the answer. Professor of infectious diseases at the ANU Medical School, Peter Collignon, said schools should remain open for students. ""If you have a lot of people sick, a lot of teachers sick, you have to adjust. You may have to have some online learning for periods if you can't deliver the schooling actually in person, but that should be a last resort and for less than a week,"" Professor Collignon said. ""Influenza is here, it comes and hits us every year. That will be a continuation of what happens, we shouldn't shut schools because of that. ""What we need to do is make sure people who are sick don't go to school to decrease the risk of giving it to others.""

65,"Amy's son gets out of his seat regularly — but to keep Liam safe, his parents had to raid their super",health,"  Families struggling to access 'life-saving' car seats for children with a disability Liam Haythorpe, who lives with autism, has always struggled to sit still in the car. His parents, Amy and Alan Haythorpe, said his behaviour while on the road used to be not only distracting but ""extremely dangerous"". ""Liam was getting out of his car seat and running through the car,"" they said. ""He would be jumping around, just going crazy. ""It's not just our safety, it's the kids' safety, it's everyone around, it's other cars, kids on the road we could hit."" The family of eight tried several different car seats to keep Liam secure during trips, but the energetic seven-year-old would always find ways to break out of his seatbelt. ""In his old seats, he would slide down and start choking himself on the seatbelt,"" Ms Haythorpe said. National surveys conducted by Mobility and Accessibility for Children in Australia (MACA) and Monash University have found the Haythorpes' experience is all too common. They found more than half of children with a disability had broken out of their car restraints. ""It's unacceptable in today's day and age that this is the experience of families,"" MACA chief executive Helen Lindner said. Ms Lindner said some families had been forced to go to extreme lengths to keep their children restrained in the car. ""We've had parents share with us harrowing stories of resorting to restraining their child with cable ties and duct tape because they felt they had no other choice,"" she said. With assistance from a health professional, after eight months the Haythorpes found the right restraint to keep Liam locked in and comfortable. But the seat cost the Adelaide family $6,000 and the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) did not cover the expense. Liam's parents were forced to pull money out of their superannuation to pay for the specialised restraint. ""If we didn't have the super, we wouldn't have got it — there's no way — and it shouldn't be that hard to get something that could save somebody's life,"" Mr Haythorpe said. Even after they got permission to use money from their super, the Haythorpes faced plenty of challenges using the seat. Despite being approved in both Europe and North America, most of the specialised car seats like the one Liam uses have not been tested against Australian standards. It means they must go through a strict exemption process to be used legally. That includes getting written approval from a doctor and organising a meeting and inspection with the Department for Planning, Transport and Infrastructure. Once a restraint is approved, a certificate must be carried in the car at all times when it is in use. ""I can't actually move the car seat to other cars. It's just for my car,"" Ms Haythorpe said. ""So if something happened to my car and I had to put it in Alan's car … we'd get a fine for it."" Despite the hurdles, the Haythorpes said they could not get by without the special car seat. ""It has been a lifesaver,"" Mr Haythorpe said. ""Now he (Liam) gets in. He puts it on himself. ""I help him with the seatbelt part. He actually likes sitting in it and he doesn't even try to get out of it."" The car seat straps Liam in tightly with a five-point harness which needs a key to be unlocked and provides extra lateral support, which keeps Liam upright to avoid him sliding out of his seat. MACA, a government-funded organisation, says a lack of national coordination between governments means families like the Haythorpes have had restricted access to the ""life-saving"" equipment. ""I had the luxury of walking into a shop and purchasing a child restraint and I had every confidence that it was going to meet my family's needs,"" Ms Lindner said. ""This is not the same experience for people with kids with disabilities. ""And then when they do finally get access to the restraint system they need, we are hearing it's life saving and life changing."" MACA is building a case to make these products more accessible by conducting its own crash tests with specialised seats that are yet to be deemed compliant by the Australian government. The research project involves six families across Australia, including the Haythorpes, documenting their experience transporting a child with a disability on video. The researchers found from their national surveys that 70 per cent of families with a disability had received no information about how to safely restrain their child in the car. ""Parents have spent years doing their own investigations, trying to find the information they need to keep their children and families safe when travelling in motor vehicles,"" Ms Lindner said. MACA has created a website to help fill the information gap, not just for families but for governments and businesses, too. ""This research will provide a deeper understanding of the experience of families than we've ever had before, which will inform the development of new products and services that respond to the real-world transport needs of families living with disability,"" Ms Lindner said. The research project is expected to be completed later this year.

66,This brand's Easter eggs 'expire' on June 1. Here's why you don't need to throw them out,health,"  Still got leftover Easter chocolate? Here's why it might be OK to eat longer than you think Each year on Easter, millions of Australians stock up on more chocolate treats than they can eat. But after the holiday, eggs and bunnies quickly disappear. In fact, it might come as a surprise, but all Cadbury Easter products actually have the same expiration date — June 1. A Cadbury spokesperson said Easter chocolates had their best before dates in June to ensure they weren't being kept by retailers until the following season. ""While some of our chocolate could potentially last for next Easter, these recommended best before dates ensure any unsold eggs and bunnies aren't offered to consumers the following season,"" a spokesperson said. ""We're committed to providing Cadbury lovers with fresh, high-quality chocolate all year round."" It's not a policy employed by all chocolate companies. A spokesperson for Lindt & Sprüngli said it gave longer best before dates to its chocolates. They also said that while the best before dates for their Easter products were dated around a similar time, they were not identical. ""We test each product extensively and determine the best before date according to the premium quality standards our products have to meet,"" the spokesperson said. ""Nevertheless, [the best before dates] are certainly longer than two months after Easter,"" they said. The ABC contacted a number of other chocolate companies selling Easter products in Australia which declined to comment. Melbourne business owner Grant Miles, who runs a food discount store, noticed Cadbury's Easter expiry dates a few years ago. His shop sells products close to, or just past their best before date, and he said he felt premature best before dates contributed to food waste. ""There are still many, many consumers who do take [best before dates] as gospel,"" he said. Mr Miles said shortening the best before date more than needed increased the chance the food would be thrown out sooner. In Australia, there are two types of food date labels: best before dates and use-by dates. While both are there to help consumers make a decision on whether to eat or drink something, experts say only use-by dates need to be followed strictly. Food Standards Australia and New Zealand outlines use-by dates as indicating when a food is no longer safe to eat, whereas best before dates are given to food that may be able to be safely eaten for a while. Foods can legally be sold after their best before date but not after the use-by. Cadbury's Easter products are all best before, meaning they can be consumed after the date as long as the chocolate has not spoiled. Food Legal co-principal Jenny Awad said when companies pick expiry dates, there are no rules preventing suppliers from shortening best before dates of their products. ""Each supplier is responsible for choosing the appropriate best before date or use-by date for their product,"" she said. ""There is no prescribed restriction preventing a supplier from shortening the use-by or best before date of a food product and doing so would be a commercial decision for the supplier."" When it comes to household food waste, one of the main contributors is food going off before it is consumed. Can't eat any more Easter eggs but have a big pile sitting in your cupboard? Here are some ways you can put Easter chocolate to good use. Simon Lockrey from the Fight Food Waste Cooperative Research Centre said understanding what different food expiries meant was key to reducing waste. The centre estimates that 25 per cent of the food Australia produces is thrown away, which is worth about $19.2 billion each year. Dr Lockrey said confusion around best before and use-by labels was also a key contributor to food waste. ""There's a lot of confusion with consumers on the difference between those dates and they are often conflated as meaning the same thing,"" Dr Lockrey said. He said the UK had moved towards removing many best before dates to reduce confusion and ensure only foods that are truly unsafe to eat have an expiry date. When it comes to overbuying food around seasonal celebrations such as Easter, Dr Lockrey said people should consider how they can use the leftover food in other recipes. Food Standards Australia and New Zealand guidelines say food may be sold after its best before date provided it's ""fit for human consumption"". But the guidelines warn food consumed after its best before date ""should be safe but it may have lost some quality"". Food safety expert Said Ajlouni said there are many foods that can be eaten past the best before dates, including chocolate. But he said people need to be vigilant and understand the risks involved with the type of food they are eating. Generally speaking, foods with low water content, like chocolate, can last longer than might be expected. ""If there is no smell, no changes in texture, especially when we talk about semi-solid food, it will be safe to eat,"" he said. ""If it is food that needs to be cooked, it will be safe because during cooking, if there is any contamination, the heat treatment can destroy this microorganism. ""But if you are in doubt, you better leave it out because you know microorganisms sometimes may be present but they don't show any sign of spoilers."" When it comes to chocolate, he said it should be fine to eat unless ""bloom"", a white coating on chocolate that can be a sign of the start of spoilage, is present. ""If they open a chocolate bar, for example, and don't see any sign of spoilage, even if it expired a few days before, in my view, from a safety perspective, it should be safe to eat,"" Dr Ajlouni.

67,Prevalence of deadly skin cancers to rise in Australia in expected 'tsunami' of cases,health,"  Deadly skin cancers to rise in Australia in 'tsunami' of cases amid shortage of GPs trained in diagnosis and treatment Australia faces a looming skills shortage among doctors able to diagnose and treat skin cancer, with melanoma cases projected to increase by about 50 per cent in the next 20 years worldwide, a public health expert says. Michael Kimlin, a Skin Cancer College Australasia (SCCA) director, has called for a national accreditation and standards system covering general practitioner training in skin cancer diagnosis and treatment, given the expected ""tsunami"" of cases. He will moderate a panel discussion on the issue at the annual Australasian Skin Cancer Congress on the Gold Coast on Friday. Research published in the journal JAMA Dermatology in March estimates the number of new melanoma cases worldwide to increase to 510,000 by 2040, up from about 325,000 in 2020 — a rise of about 50 per cent. Deaths internationally are projected to jump from 57,000 to 96,000 during the next two decades – a spike of 68 per cent. More than 16,000 melanoma cases are diagnosed in Australia annually and about 1,300 Australians die of the skin cancer each year. Australia and New Zealand have the highest incidences of skin cancer in the world. Professor Kimlin, a Queensland University of Technology epidemiologist and skin cancer researcher, said skilling up a workforce of general practitioners in best-practice skin cancer care remained the most cost-effective way of addressing rising case numbers in the Australian population. ""It is critical that we work with the new federal health minister to create a national accreditation and standards system so that consumers can easily identify the qualifications of their practitioner and be confident that the practice those doctors work within adheres to robust national standards,"" he said. ""Post-graduation training is really important because this is how most skin cancers are detected — people going in for a cough or a sore knee, or some other issue they want to discuss with their GP, and while they're there they go: 'Oh, could you look at this spot on my leg?' ""Early intervention, treatment and monitoring produces far better outcomes, lower deaths … than those that are left too long."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Professor Kimlin said skin cancers imposed the highest costs of any cancer on the Australian health system and prevention and early detection remained the most cost-effective ways to reduce the escalating financial burden. A recent study by QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute health economist Associate Professor Louisa Gordon — one of the presenters at the three-day congress — found the average first-year costs of treating melanoma per patient ranged from about $650 for early-stage disease to more than $100,000 for advanced stage. The SCCA runs an accreditation program for general practitioners, allowing patients to identify doctors who have completed significant additional study and have undergone assessment in the diagnosis, treatment and management of skin cancer.

68,"Being told to reduce your stress can feel 'disempowering', says this expert. She has some better suggestions",health,"  Stress is difficult to escape in modern life. Experts say we should change our approach When Adam lost control of the muscles in the left-hand side of his face thanks to Bell's palsy, he was told that stress may have made him more susceptible to the condition. ""That was a big signal to me to pay a little bit more attention to my stress levels,"" he tells ABC RN's This Working Life. But as an employee in the professional services industry with a never-ending to-do list and several long-term projects on the go, Adam wasn't sure where to start. He's not alone. This Working Life looks at how (and why) we work, exploring workplace practices to culture and leadership. In 2015, the Australian Psychological Society's Stress and Wellbeing in Australia survey revealed 35 per cent of Australians reported a significant level of distress. More recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the COVID-19 pandemic has made the world an inherently more stressful place to exist, with social isolation, loneliness, fear of infection and death, and financial worries leading to unprecedented stress levels globally. Unfortunately, it seems stress is difficult to escape. So is trying to reduce it the best option? Or should we be learning to address stress in a different way? Alison Earl is an author and trainer in mindset and resilience. She says, rather than trying to stress less, it's time we changed the way we think about it. ""Trying to eliminate stress and reduce it is actually really unrealistic when you break down how we live our lives."" Ms Earl has experienced what she calls ""the dark side"" of stress. Six years ago, she was living in New York, working around the clock and running on adrenaline. Then she was diagnosed with proctitis, an inflammatory condition of the lower digestive system. ""I was told it would never go away,"" she says. ""The doctor said I needed to learn how to manage it, and the biggest thing I should do is reduce my stress."" Ms Earl says this advice wasn't very helpful. ""The message that the only way to manage stress is to reduce it is one of the most disempowering messages out there,"" she says. She had a more positive relationship with stress in the past. As a young athlete, she'd used it to her advantage. ""Stress or pressure to perform was always something I really relished,"" she says. So, in the face of her chronic health diagnosis, Ms Earl decided to harness a different way of thinking about her stress. ""I re-engaged with the athlete mentality of how stress is useful and helpful,"" she says. She says this mindset shift — of seeing stress as a positive — had a dramatic effect on her health and her life. ""My symptoms cleared up completely and I haven't experienced any in six years."" Dr Kari Leibowitz, a health psychologist from Stanford University who has conducted research into how changing your approach can improve your health and wellbeing, says mindset can be incredibly powerful. ""It creates this self-fulfilling prophecy,"" she says. In essence, if you start thinking stress is good for you, it starts being good for you. ""People have fewer sick days, they perform better at work and have greater life satisfaction,"" Dr Leibowitz says. She highlights the work of mindset expert Dr Alia Crum, who is the principal investigator at the Stanford Mind and Body Lab. Dr Crum's research suggests there are both psychological and physiological benefits to changing your mindset. In a 2007 study, the researcher asked a group of hotel room attendants how much exercise they got in a week. ""Two thirds of them said that they didn't exercise regularly and one third said they got no exercise at all,"" Dr Leibowitz says. ""But if you think about it, hotel room attendants get a lot of exercise. ""They're on their feet all day, they're changing bed linens, they're scrubbing bathtubs, they're moving all day long."" So Dr Crum told half the attendants their work meant they were exercising and the amount they were doing exceeded the general recommendations for adults. ""Four weeks later, those room attendants not only liked their jobs more, but they also reported significant weight loss and had reduced blood pressure,"" Dr Leibowitz says. Get a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by subscribing to our monthly newsletter Ms Earl says although many people accept that stress can help performance, they find it difficult to believe it's good for you. But changing the way we think about stress has a knock-on effect in the rest of the body, she says. ""It's not just about feeling better about it, research shows we also release different hormones in our body,"" Ms Earl says. ""So our body has a different physiological response to make it less harmful and more helpful."" Dr Leibowitz says one of the ways to help understand how stress can be good for you is to realise it can be a marker for the things we really care about. ""The most rewarding, fulfilling, meaningful parts of our lives are also the parts where we've experienced stress,"" she says, such as family and work. But she acknowledges this can sometimes be hard to realise in the moment, particularly because of the physiological sensations we experience. ""[When we're feeling stressed], our body is trying to prepare us for what it thinks is an emergency,"" she says. In these instances, Dr Leibowitz says it can be helpful to reframe your stress. ""There's a study showing that if you can get kids who are taking [exams] to reframe their stress as excitement, it helps them perform better."" She says it's worth observing your physical experience of stress, such as a faster heart rate and sweaty palms, and telling yourself you're excited – even if you're not. ""This can be a 'fake it 'til you make it' moment."" But Dr Leibowitz says sometimes pretending isn't possible. ""Sometimes you're not thriving, you're not living your best life."" She believes many of us have understandably felt that way due to the pandemic. There's no doubt stress can be debilitating. Burn-out was listed in the WHO's 2019 revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as an occupational phenomenon. It was defined as the result of chronic workplace stress that hasn't been successfully managed. Dr Leibowitz says the focus of stress management needs to shift. ""So much of it is on reducing stress only, and not on building up other things that bring us joy and feed into our positive emotions,"" she says. Ms Earl agrees, suggesting a two-minute energy-boosting activity five times a day — such as a breathing exercise, listening to a song or watching a funny video — can transform how you feel. This can be particularly hard to do when we're feeling stressed. ""When we're in scarcity mode and feel like there aren't enough hours in the day, our brain is telling us that any time we spend away will result in a loss of productivity or the bottom line,"" says Dr Leibowitz. But she says your brain's got it all wrong. ""So much of the research shows that taking breaks makes us more creative and efficient and that fuelling our bodies helps us perform."" ""So, for a week, do an experiment where every hour you force yourself to go and move around a little bit, and drink a glass of water and step outside for two minutes and breathe in the fresh air."" ""At the end of the week, ask yourself a) how do you feel and b) how much less have you gotten done?"" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

69,"Millions of Australians with disability are not on the NDIS, creating a 'worthy and unworthy' divide",health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Lisa Giles is ""angry as hell"" after being rejected twice for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Ms Giles stopped working as a property manager in 2005 due to the impact of multiple conditions including severe cervical spinal stenosis, which causes neck pain. She uses a walking stick, rarely leaving her home due to debilitating fatigue, and said ""bad days"" leave her with ""tremendous exhaustion"". ""I have about 2-3 hours a day that I can try and do something,"" Ms Giles said. ""I'm often in a lot of pain by night."" While Ms Giles, who lives an hour's drive west of Sydney in the Blue Mountains, has been on the Disability Support Pension (DSP) since 2006, she is ""desperate"" for more help. Ms Giles said the DSP is not enough to cover all expenses and the cost of her multiple medications. ""I'm self-funding medicinal cannabis every 15 days. I am losing about 100 bucks every week on that alone,"" she said. ""I can't keep it up anymore."" Ms Giles said she is desperate for treatment such as remedial massage and hydrotherapy, but Medicare provided limited assistance. ""I need regular physio, not five visits a year … that's like a band-aid on a raging wound."" Ms Giles said she believes the NDIS eligibility system is not fair and equitable. ""We should not say there's the worthy disabled and the unworthy disabled,"" she said. The NDIS has come a long way since its inception about a decade ago. Trials kicked off in parts of the country in 2013, before the transition to full rollout began in 2016. The government declared the scheme ""available to all eligible Australians, no matter where they live"" in July 2020. Do you have a story to share? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au. Today, while an estimated 4.4 million Australians live with disability, just over 518,000 — or about 12 per cent — are on the NDIS, according to the latest quarterly report. Australians aged 65 and over are not eligible for the scheme, and disability advocates say people living with lesser-known or invisible disabilities can have a hard time providing evidence they fit the criteria. They also say the application process is so complex and onerous that it can dissuade people from applying in the first place. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The future of the NDIS has been a major focus during the election campaign, amid a spike in participants reporting they've had their funding slashed in recent months. There has been a large spike in the number of NDIS participants reporting their plans have been slashed, with many seeking legal help and causing congestion in the appeals system. Professor Anne Kavanagh, chair of disability and health at the University of Melbourne, said it was ""troubling"" to see the election campaign commentary dominated by the NDIS and suggestions by some the scheme was ""out of control"". ""No one is talking about the [more than] 85 per cent of people with disabilities who aren't on the NDIS and many of those people are struggling to get the services and supports they need to live ordinary lives,"" Professor Kavanagh said. ""Many state governments have completely withdrawn any funding from any other kinds of disability supports."" Rita Barnett lives with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a complex and disabling multi-system disorder characterised by severe and long-term fatigue, among other symptoms. It meant Ms Barnett had to stop work as a counsellor and psychotherapist in 2018, and while she received a total and permanent disability (TPD) payout through her superannuation, she has been rejected by the NDIS twice. The 51-year-old, who lives on the New South Wales Central Coast, said the insurance agency approved her TPD claim ""without question"" and without having to go ""above and beyond"" to prove her disability. ""They seemed to believe and honour every doctor's report,"" she said. ""It was quite a seamless process."" To fit the eligibility criteria, NDIS applicants need to prove a number of things, including that their disability is caused by an impairment, that the impairment is likely to be permanent, and that the impairment reduces their capacity to perform everyday tasks, work, study or take part in social life. Ms Barnett said the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), which runs the NDIS, told her in a letter it acknowledged her impairments were ""permanent"", but did not accept there was a ""functional impact"" because her condition was ""fluctuating"". ""It was almost like they twisted things … to justify the reasons of not accepting that I had a disability, which felt like bureaucratic gaslighting,"" Ms Barnett said. Married for 25 years to her husband Paul, Ms Barnett said she was lucky he worked from home and had his support. ""That's usually when I get the most emotional, because of the impact on him … the difference of having the support of the NDIS, for me, would mean that he could be rested."" Professor Kavanagh said people with pain and fatigue-centric conditions had been ""forgotten"" by the NDIS and those on the DSP could not afford allied health care services. ""It's actually expensive to have a disability,"" she said. ""It shouldn't be a situation where you're in the NDIS and you can access services and supports and you're outside of the NDIS and there's nothing."" Professor Kavanagh said the ""original intent"" of the NDIS was that a system — commonly referred to as ""Tier 2"" — would be established to support those outside of the scheme to access services through local area coordination. Advocacy groups estimate 1,140 NDIS participants, like Alicia, are stuck in hospitals waiting for specialist housing plans to be signed off or for disputes to be resolved. But, she said, that system was not running as well as it could be. ""[The NDIS has] actually been mainly concentrating on doing plans for people who are in the scheme, so the people outside the scheme cannot access these local area coordinators who were meant to help them navigate the mainstream services."" The ABC posed a series of questions to NDIS Minister Linda Reynolds, including about the '""Tier 2"" system, which were answered by a spokesperson for Social Services Minister Anne Ruston. Senator Ruston's spokesperson said the NDIS was designed to provide supports to Australians with ""significant and permanent disability"". ""States and territories are still primarily responsible for ensuring all people with disability have access to the mainstream supports they require,"" they said in a statement. The spokesperson said a re-elected Coalition would ""continue to work"" with the states and territories ""on their shared responsibility to ensure appropriate supports [are] available to people with disability outside of the NDIS"". Labor's NDIS spokesperson, Bill Shorten, said the Morrison government had failed to run the scheme as it was intended. ""The Coalition abandoned 'Tier 2' framework from the get-go, which has left tens of thousands of people without any kind of supports,"" Mr Shorten said in a statement. ""If elected, Labor will centrally coordinate disability across government and bring forward a planned review of NDIS design, operation and sustainability.""

70,SA government strikes deal with crossbench to end COVID emergency declaration,health,"  New laws designed to handle South Australia's COVID-19 management for the second half of this year are set to pass parliament. The government has struck a deal with the Greens and SA Best in the Legislative Council, incorporating some crossbench amendments to the bill that passed the lower house earlier in the month. The amendments include the creation of a COVID oversight committee for the next six months to assess any new restrictions put in place for people with the virus or close contacts. Premier Peter Malinauskas said the changes will help end the Emergency Declaration at the end of June, as promised during the lead-up to the election. ""We are now on track to realise that ambition, working closely with the Chief Public Health Officer and the Police Commissioner and now the whole parliament to see the passage of legislation that will enable that to occur,"" he said. ""I continue to acknowledge and absolutely thank the work of both the Police Commissioner and Professor Nicola Spurrier in seeing the state through the events of COVID using that emergency management declaration. ""But clearly we are coming to a period where that time is over and we start to restore the ordinary functioning of government in a traditional way."" New premier Peter Malinauskas has repeatedly made it clear his desire to stop using the Emergency Management Act to help maintain a level of control over the pandemic. It was a desire the former Liberal government also had but they did not end up getting changes through parliament during the previous term. The proposed legislative reforms presented to parliament this month would allow SA Health to put controls in place through modifications to the Public Health Act. ""When the declaration ends, it is important that we still have some protections in place for our most vulnerable South Australians,"" Mr Malinauskas said. ""The most appropriate way we can do this is to amend the Public Health Act to include protections for patients and residents in aged care, hospitals and disability care, and the ability for rules to be set for COVID-positive people and close contacts."" Broad community-wide controls, like lockdowns, would not be possible under the new laws once the emergency declaration ends. But they could be implemented once more if a new declaration were to be issued. In a letter obtained by ABC News, the Law Society of South Australia has outlined a raft of concerns it sees with the changes as they currently sit. Chief among them is that they give the government what the society has branded as ""wide-ranging powers"" to enforce COVID directions. ""Enshrining such extraordinary powers in legislation permanently must be carefully considered and accompanied by some guarantee of proportionality with respect to ensuring an individual's basic rights and freedoms when such powers are exercised,"" Law Society president Justin Stewart-Rattray wrote. He added the society has reservations about how close contacts are defined and the scope of directions, branding them ""concerningly opaque."" While the Liberal opposition wants to move on from the Emergency Management Act being used to handle COVID, the party has its own reservations, including with the size of the proposed penalties in the bill. The current changes would see maximum penalties of two years in jail or a $20,000 fine for individuals who fail to comply with directions. For a business, the fine jumps to $75,000. ""Decreases in penalties to remove imprisonment and reduce maximum sanctions by a third are important and will see the state become more aligned with penalties in other jurisdictions,"" opposition health spokeswoman Ashton Hurn said. The Liberals are expected to introduce amendments to the laws in the Upper House but the government said it is yet to see them. ""This is very serious legislation. We are trying to deal with it on a constructive basis,"" Health Minister Chris Picton said. ""We actually need to see proposals, not just by press release but by the actual amendment work being done from the Liberal Party to be considered in the Parliament."" Freshly elected One Nation MLC Sarah Game has flagged her intention to introduce amendments too, which she said will safeguard democracy and ""fundamental individual rights"". ""This is an attempt to permanently enshrine COVID-19 powers while removing legislative safeguards under the Public Health Act, that until now have only been exercised under a declared emergency,"" Ms Game said. ""This is not democratic, this is not 'living with' COVID-19 and this is not what South Australians voted for.""

71,The COVID-19 death toll in the US has passed 1 million,health,"  On the deadliest day of a horrific week in April 2020, COVID-19 took the lives of 816 people in New York City alone. Lost in the blizzard of pandemic data that's been swirling ever since is the fact that 43-year-old Fernando Morales was one of them. Two years and 1 million deaths later, his brother, Adam Almonte, fingers Mr Morales's bass guitar and visualises him playing tunes. In a park overlooking the Hudson River, he recalls days long ago tossing a baseball with Mr Morales. The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic passes 6 million, but experts believe the real figure could be as much as four times higher. ""When he passed away, it was like I lost a brother, a parent and a friend all at the same time,"" says Mr Almonte, 16 years younger than Mr Morales, who shared his love of books, video games and wrestling and worked for the city processing teachers' pensions. If losing one person leaves such a lasting void, consider all that's been lost with the deaths of 1 million people. Last week, the White House confirmed the US had passed that once-unthinkable milestone. The pandemic has left an estimated 194,000 children in the US without one or both of their parents. It has deprived communities of leaders, teachers and caregivers. It has robbed the country of expertise and persistence, humour and devotion. Through wave after wave, the virus has compiled a merciless chronology of loss — one by one by one. When it began, the threat hadn't yet come into focus. In February 2020, an unfamiliar respiratory illness started spreading through a nursing home outside Seattle, the Life Care Center of Kirkland. Neil Lawyer, 84, was a short-term patient there, recovering after hospitalisation for an infection. When he died of COVID-19 on March 8, the coronavirus death toll in the US stood at 30. Mr Lawyer, born on a Mississippi farm to parents whose mixed-race heritage subjected them to bitter discrimination, was the family's first college graduate. Trained as a chemist, he lived and worked in Belgium for more than two decades. Fellow expats knew him for his devotion to coaching baseball and for his rich baritone. After Mr Lawyer — known to his family as ""Moose"" — and his wife retired to Bellevue, Washington, he and other family members would serenade couples at their weddings in an ensemble dubbed the Moose-Tones. Last October, when one of his granddaughters married, the Moose-Tones went on without him. ""He would have just been beaming because, you know, it was the most important thing in the world to him late in life, to get together with family,"" his son, David Lawyer, says. By late spring of 2020, the pandemic seemed to be loosening its grip — until governors moved to reopen their states and deaths spiralled again. Luis Alfonso Bay Montgomery had worked through the pandemic's early months, piloting a tractor through the lettuce and cauliflower fields near Yuma, Arizona. Even after he began feeling sick in mid-June, he insisted on labouring on, says Yolanda Bay, his wife of 42 years. By the time Mr Montgomery, 59, was rushed to a hospital, he required intubation. He died on July 18, a day that saw the US toll surpass 140,000. And for the first time since they'd met as teenagers in their native Mexico, Ms Bay was on her own. Driving past the fields her husband ploughed, she imagines him on his tractor. ""It's time to get rid of his clothes, but …"" she says, unable to finish the sentence. ""There are times that I feel completely alone."" On December 14, 2020, cameras jockeyed for position as the nation's first COVID vaccine was administered to a New York nurse. But the vaccines had arrived too late to save a fellow caregiver, Jennifer McClung. At Helen Keller Hospital in Sheffield, Alabama, staffers knew Ms McClung, a longtime dialysis nurse, as ""Mama Jen."" She took new nurses under her wing and on some nights, woke up crying with worry about her patients. In November, Ms McClung, 54, and her husband, John, also a hospital worker, both tested positive. She died hours before the vaccination campaign began and the US toll passed 300,000. Today, a decal with a halo and angel's wings marks the place Ms McClung once occupied a third-floor nurses' station. Her mother, Stella Olive, has a digital picture frame in her kitchen displaying a steady stream of pictures and videos of the daughter she lost. ""I can hear her laugh. I can hear her voice,"" Ms McClung's mother says. ""I just can't touch her. It is the hardest thing in the world."" Last September, as Sherman Peebles, a sheriff's deputy in Columbus, Georgia, lay in the hospital, the US toll topped 675,000, surpassing the number of Americans killed by the Spanish flu pandemic a century ago. He died the following day. In addition to his work as a lawman, 49-year-old Mr Peebles spent every Saturday manning a barber chair at his best friend Gerald Riley's shop. Mr Riley still arrives at the barber shop each Saturday expecting to see Mr Peebles's truck. At day's end, he thinks back to the routine he and his friend of more than 20 years always followed. ""I love you, brother,"" they'd tell one another. How could Mr Riley have known those would be the last words they'd ever share? The doctors and nurses were fighting for their lives. So, every evening through the spring of 2020, Larry Mass and Arnie Kantrowitz opened the windows to thank them, joining New York's symphony of air horns and raucous cheers. Mr Mass worried about his partner, whose immune system was weakened by medication after a kidney transplant. For months, Mr Kantrowitz, a retired professor and noted gay rights activist, took refuge on their couch. But it wasn't enough. Arnie Kantrowitz died of complications from COVID on January 21 as the toll moved nearer to 1 million. Mr Kantrowitz's papers, in the collection of the New York Public Library, preserve a record of his activism. But the 40 years he shared with Mr Mass can only live in memory. On days when news headlines leave Mr Mass feeling angry about the world, he reaches out to his missing partner. What would Mr Kantrowitz say if he were here? ""He's still with me,"" Mr Mass says. ""He's there in my heart.""

72,WA records unprecedented 14 deaths in 24 hours as COVID continues to ravage state,health,"  Western Australia has recorded 14 deaths in the last 24 hours, the highest daily figure of fatalities the state has reported over the course of the pandemic. The deaths come amid 15, 674 new COVID cases, including four men and a woman in their 90s, five men and a woman in their 80s, two men in their 70s and a man in his 50s. There are now 325 West Australians in hospital with COVID, with 11 people in intensive care. A total of 88,710 people in the state currently have the virus. WA has recorded 576,315 cases since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Premier Mark McGowan said the deaths reported today took place over the past fortnight. He said he believed WA residents were taking the pandemic seriously. ""Look, I suspect West Australians take it more seriously than people in any other state,"" he said. ""Other states have been through multiple waves, New South Wales and Victoria.... sadly people are dying there in large numbers every day."" Modelling earlier this year suggested WA would peak at around 10,000 cases per day, with almost 500 people in hospital including 56 in ICU. Today's hospital figures are well below those predictions, even as case numbers far exceed what was anticipated. The state's peak medical bodies are continuing to push for the reintroduction of stricter COVID measures, including mask-wearing. The WA government has to pass new legislation every time it wants to extend its pandemic powers. This is what it means and why it is important. AMA WA president Mark Duncan-Smith said yesterday he expected the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 to reach 400 in the next one to two weeks. ""The hospital system is going to show major stress and crisis for the next two weeks, including increased critical ramping, critical ambulance shortages … increased furloughing of staff,"" he said. ""We're going to get critical problems, which are a direct result of that inability to act and reintroduce masks."" Mr McGowan today refused to be drawn on whether the government might consider reintroducing stricter restrictions. ""If you want to wear a mask when you're out, please wear a mask, take care of your health,"" he said. The Premier said the most important thing was for people to get vaccinated if they already weren't. The current third dose vaccination rate for over 16s is 80.9 per cent. The state's health system continues to struggle under the weight of the additional burden of COVID, with a Perth woman dying on Sunday after an ambulance failed to reach her in time. The ambulance arrived about two and a half hours after she rang St John complaining of chest pains, on a day when about 40 per cent of ambulance personnel were off work due to COVID. She is the third woman to die in recent weeks because of ambulance failings, after a woman died while under the care of paramedics at Busselton Hospital last month and another died just days later while waiting for an ambulance in Geraldton.

73,Perth woman dies after waiting over two hours for an ambulance as St John promises inquiry,health,"  WA Premier Mark McGowan has apologised to the family of a woman who died waiting more than two hours for an ambulance, suggesting St John's could have requested the support of the Department of Fire and Emergency Services. Georgina Wild died of a heart attack in the early hours of Sunday morning. She had called triple zero about 2:30am complaining of chest pains and her call was flagged with St John Ambulance as priority 1, meaning an ambulance should arrive within 15 minutes. It's understood St John checked on Ms Wild's welfare by phone twice, at 3:00am and again at 3:30am, advising her no ambulance was available yet. She did not answer a third welfare check call at 4:00am when a call centre worker left a message on her answering machine. ""Hi Georgina, it's Daniel from St John Ambulance call centre here just calling to check in,"" it said. Mr McGowan said despite ambulance staffing levels being down 40 per cent at the time of Ms Wild's call because of COVID, the situation was ""not acceptable"". ""I want to say sorry to Georgina Wild's family,"" he said. ""The loss of any loved one is a terribly sad event, and in these circumstances, absolutely, very, very difficult, I'm sure, for the family to endure."" He said it was ""clearly not acceptable"" that an ambulance did not arrive for two and a half hours. ""We have passed on our concerns to St John about that,"" he said. St John Ambulance chief executive Michelle Fyfe admitted there had been an ""excessive delay"". ""It was a delayed response that we are most certainly not happy with. ""It is a delayed response that doesn't meet or is coming close to our key performance indicators,"" she told ABC Radio Perth. She said a clinical inquiry into the circumstances of the case would be launched immediately. ""This is absolutely devastating for the family. Obviously, we offer our sincere condolences it is devastating for everybody all around. ""But you know, no words are ever going to make this ... no one's ever going to make this better."" Ms Fyfe said St John would contact the family as soon as the police sent confirmation of next of kin details. Ms Fyfe said from Saturday night into Sunday morning, the service was ""incredibly stretched"". The incident came shortly before St John issued its second warning to the public in a week about likely delays in responding to emergency calls thanks to extreme demand for ambulance services. Nearly 90,000 West Australians are currently in isolation with COVID, and Ms Fyfe said demand across the entire health system was very high at present. ""That's because we are in the midst of a pandemic, we're still in a state of emergency and demand is increasing,"" she said. She said ambulance services around the nation had been suffering from an increase in demand, although this was ""no excuse"" for the woman's death. A parliamentary inquiry is expected to report this week on whether ambulance services should be taken back into the public sector. But Ms Fyfe said that even in the current difficult circumstances, WA's ambulance service was regularly in the top three in Australia, with more depots per capita than anywhere else. ""We are at the lowest cost to government and with a patient satisfaction rating of 97 per cent,"" she said. Mr McGowan said the nearest hospital to Ms Wild, Joondalup Health Campus, was not subject to ramping at the time she called for an ambulance. ""We're investigating what further involvement the government can have in these issues and what further management we can put in place to ensure better performance by our ambulance service,"" he said. Mr McGowan said there were opportunities for St John to request the use of Department of Fire and Emergency Services personnel in times of crisis, and flagged greater government involvement in St John operations. ""At the point in time that this incident occurred, they had not requested that,"" he said. ""So we are working to try and get to the bottom of what happened and what further can be done."" Opposition Leader Mia Davies said her heart went out to the family of the woman who died. ""It certainly doesn't help that we have a Health Minister and St Johns Ambulance, it would seem, at ten paces standing off,"" she said. ""We need the state government and St Johns to be working collaboratively to deliver the service that West Australians deserve. ""It seems unfathomable that we have such a significant surplus and yet we have a health system that is crumbling. ""They could've invested far earlier, what we see is large dollar investments being made hand over fist to try and spend their way out of a crisis of their own making."" Ms Davies said she hoped any future changes to St John were not politically motivated.

75,NSW Now: Community in shock over stabbing of Hawkesbury Mayor,health,"  Here's what you need to know this morning. The Deputy Mayor of Hawkesbury Council says the stabbing of the local Mayor during a violent home invasion has left fellow councillors and the community horrified. Patrick Conolly, 32, was stabbed in the arm and threatened by at least five men who forced their way into his Bligh Park home early on Monday morning. His wife and four young children were at home at the time but were not injured. Police believe the attack was a case of mistaken identity. Deputy Mayor Barry Calvert said Mr Conolly was understood to be recovering well after the ordeal. ""If I was him, I'd be in a state of shock,"" he said. ""You're just at home minding your own business and suddenly five or six big fellows come in and start pushing you around. ""It must have been traumatic for the whole family."" The NSW mental health commissioner says improved access to telehealth could be behind a jump in the number of people in regional areas seeking help. The commission's latest COVID-19 wellbeing survey showed the number of regional residents accessing support jumped from 40 per cent in 2020 to 53 per cent in 2021. Commissioner Catherine Lourey said she was surprised to learn how badly the pandemic affected mental health in regional communities last year. She said rural communities felt a stronger sense of connection and resilience during the first wave of the pandemic, but the cumulative effects of drought, fire, flood and the mouse plague might have led to a decline last year. ""That's a real concern for us to really keep top of mind — that especially for some regional communities, there's that sequence of impacts, and that probably contributed as well."" Artist, writer and educator Safdar Ahmed has won the Book of the Year gong at the NSW Premier's Literary Awards for his graphic novel Still Alive: Notes from Australia's Immigration Detention System. Described by the judges as a work of ""vision, ambition and achievement"", Still Alive was awarded Book of the Year  Award ($10,000) and the Multicultural NSW Award ($20,000). ""Ahmed's work stands out as an example of brilliant storytelling created with and through community, a labour of generosity, and love. It is an unflinching critique of policy and discourse that demonstrates the power of art,"" the judges said. Still Alive combines different genres to share the stories of asylum seekers detained in Sydney's Villawood Immigration Detention Centre and in offshore detention on Nauru and Manus Island. Other winners included Tony Birch, who was awarded the Christina Stead Prize for Fiction ($40,000) for his latest short story collection, Dark as Last Night, and Kate Holden, who won the Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction ($40,000) for The Winter Road: A Story of Legacy, Land and a Killing at Croppa Creek. Katherine Brabon won the publicly voted People's Choice Award for her second novel The Shut Ins, which dives into the life of a hikikomori (a person who avoids social contact). Two men have been charged over the assault of a 31-year-old man at Strathfield in Sydney's inner west. Emergency services were called to Strathfield Railway Station after reports of a brawl in the early hours of Sunday morning. A man suffering head injuries was found in a nearby car park on Albert Road and police were told he had been assaulted by up to three men who were seen running towards the railway station. The man was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in a serious condition. Late on Sunday, two 18-year-old men were arrested and taken to Auburn Police Station where they were charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company of others. They have been refused bail to appear before Burwood Local Court on Monday May 16. Anti-domestic-violence groups say a Fair Work Commission in-principle decision giving paid leave to millions of workers experiencing domestic and family violence is a ""game changer"". The industrial umpire yesterday announced the provisional decision granting around 2.5 million award workers 10 days of paid leave if they are victims of domestic violence. Whoever wins the federal election will have to decide whether to extend the leave to more than 8 million workers covered by the National Employment Standards. Hayley Foster from Full Stop Australia said it was a ""landmark"" decision. Unions are hoping it will set a precedent for all employed Australians. Sunny.

76,How sick will you be if you catch COVID twice?,health,"  So, you're starting to feel unwell. Your throat hurts, your head aches, you feel tired and you've developed a cough. You've recently had COVID but as we now know, it's possible to be reinfected. But how sick will you get the second time? While your symptoms are likely to be less severe, in some cases they can be worse. Here's what we know so far. Current guidelines define you as a ""cleared case"" for 12 weeks after ending COVID isolation. If you develop COVID-like symptoms in that 12 weeks, you don't need to be tested. The science behind this 12-week timeframe is evolving. The original idea was that if you have recovered from COVID, and you have a healthy immune system, you will have developed immunity against reinfection. And this will protect you for at least 12 weeks. As case numbers in Australia increase, the reports of reinfections are also on the rise. And it's likely reinfection is occurring sooner than we first thought. In order for a person to fight off re-infection with any virus, they must have developed a protective immune response. Most of us know someone who has managed to dodge catching COVID-19, despite being in a household with people who are sick. What makes some of us more resistant than others? Two main factors decide whether a person will have a protective immune response: 1) how long a person's immune memory lasts 2) how well that memory recognises the virus, or a slightly different virus. Immune memory is made up of many critical parts, which each play a role in the protective army of your immunity. The biggest players in protective immunity memory are your B-cells (which mature to make antibodies) and your T-cells (which destroy virus-infected host cells). So far, the evidence suggests immune memory for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, lasts for months or even years when it comes to B-cells and the antibodies they produce. Similarly, current evidence shows the memory T-cells can last over a year. This means that for a healthy person, immune memory for SARS-CoV-2 appears to last for a year, against reinfection with the exact same virus. One clear explanation for reinfection is the virus is mutating. SARS-CoV-2 replicates fast and in doing so makes replication errors. We refer to these errors as mutations. Over time, the mutations accumulate and a new sub-variant is born. Since the start of the pandemic we have seen the parental Wuhan strain mutate to Alpha, Beta, Delta and now Omicron. The current theory is that immunity from one variant may not provide enough protection from another. Data so far suggest the Omicron variant is better at immune escape than its predecessors. This means Omicron is ""escaping"" the immune memory created by SARS-CoV-2 infections from other variants such as Delta, Beta or Alpha. Emerging data is now showing sub-variants of Omicron can also escape immunity from a previous Omicron variant. This means a person might be able to get an Omicron reinfection. A small, yet-to-be peer reviewed study from Denmark found that in unvaccinated people, reinfection with Omicron BA.2 is possible following a primary infection with Omicron BA.1. Despite this finding, the study also concluded reinfection rates were low and therefore rare. With winter approaching and case numbers climbing, we're also seeing the emergence of new sub-variants such as BA.4 and BA.5. Early evidence shows these new sub-variants are even better at escaping immune memory than the parental BA.1 Omicron. For those who get a reinfection, disease severity appears to be milder and less likely to result in hospitalisation. This is likely because the immune memory can recognise at least part of the re-infecting virus. Why are we seeing more of these new sub-variants? Is the virus mutating faster? And what are the implications for the future of COVID? However it's difficult to measure disease severity on a population level. A systemic review of case studies found that while some second infections were milder, this was not so in all cases. Some reinfections resulted in worse outcomes, including death. (During this study period, one of the original strains, B.1, caused most primary infections, with reinfections caused by Alpha or Beta variants.) But while Omicron appears to be causing more reinfections than other variants, there isn't enough robust data to make firm conclusions about the severity of reinfection with Omicron or other variants. What we know for certain is we need more data from more people to say that reinfection is less severe. We also know from several studies that being vaccinated does provide protection from reinfection, including in previously infected people who then receive subsequent vaccines. A recent study that's yet to be peer-reviewed found immunity from Omicron BA.1 variant drops around 7.5 fold with the new Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants. This means the antibodies you produce from a BA.1 infection, which are able to detect and neutralise the BA.1 virus, are 7.5 times less able to recognise and neutralise BA.4 and BA.5 than BA.1. This study also found vaccination plus natural exposure to Omicron BA.1 gave five times greater protection to Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 than the immunity from natural exposure to BA.1 alone. Data also shows the strongest protective immunity comes from a mix of triple vaccination and natural infection. A further study found this type of hybrid immunity protects better against both reinfection and hospitalisation than natural immunity alone, highlighting the importance of vaccination and vaccine boosters. So the question remains: if our immune memory lasts for a year, but is too specific to recognise the new variants, will we need a new vaccine every year? Time will tell.

77,Jacinta had many costs during pregnancy — but there was a test Medicare didn't cover at all,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes From the day Jacinta Sirr-Williams discovered she was pregnant there was the usual run of doctors' appointments, scans and blood tests — and, with them, came out-of-pocket costs. But there was one test where she didn't get a single cent back from Medicare. It's called Non-Invasive Pre-natal Testing (NIPT) — or by one of its brand names, the Harmony test. At $400 to $500, it's one of the key out-of-pocket expenses faced by expectant parents. ""I didn't realise the NIPT test was going to be $400. It was more than a surprise,"" she said. ""That's a barrier for a whole lot of people, especially when you're buying baby things."" NIPT is a blood test offered to many women about 10 weeks into their pregnancy. It takes a sample of the mother's blood, which contains fragments of DNA from the baby's placenta, to detect three genetic conditions, including Down syndrome. Many parents also use the test to find out the gender of their baby. The ABC has previously reported controversies around this test because parents can feel pressured to terminate pregnancies if results suggest a baby may have a high risk of one of three genetic conditions. Research shows many families feel pressured to terminate their pregnancies after positive tests for Down syndrome. It's a screening test, which means if it comes back positive, parents are urged to have further diagnostic testing under a riskier procedure that extracts cells from the placenta or amniotic fluid via CVS (chorionic villus sampling) or amniocentesis, to confirm the results. For Jacinta, having the test wasn't necessarily about having a choice on whether to proceed with a pregnancy or not, but rather having information going forward. ""If something is not right, you have the opportunity to set up your home and talk to specialists before your baby gets here,"" she said. ""It means you can reach out to different groups, have the knowledge before it happens, and be able to process it and go to a counsellor."" Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au. In the lead-up to the election, both major parties have promised to fund more genetic testing before parents get pregnant and after babies are born, but neither side has addressed NIPT. Labor has committed $38.4 million to expand the number of genetic conditions that babies are given a heel-prick test for after birth from 25 to 80. The Coalition has committed $81 million for new Medicare items to make it free for couples planning to get pregnant to test whether they are carriers for cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy or fragile X syndrome. In 2018, the College of Pathologists of Australasia and Roche Diagnostics applied to the federal government to have NIPT subsidised by Medicare, and failed. For Jacinta, the test was important after having bowel cancer at age 30 and discovering she had Lynch syndrome, a genetic condition predisposing people to bowel and other cancers. NIPT doesn't include detection of propensity for Lynch syndrome, but her experience made her understand the importance of genetic testing. ""[NIPT], for us, was a no-brainer just to go that extra step — for us, knowledge is power,"" she said. Jacinta's cancer was caught and treated early. Her NIPT was clear and baby Anna was born in April. Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists president Benjamin Bopp said, controversies aside, NIPT was helpful to specialists. If tests confirmed that a baby was at high risk of a genetic condition, the baby and mother may have extra needs, he said, and that would change the way the specialists handled the mother's care. ""If parents decide to proceed, doctors can monitor for a range of potential complications for the baby,"" he said. ""Heart defects and reduced growth of the foetus, for example, may be associated with some of the genetic conditions screened for. ""Some of the genetic conditions also affect maternal health. Some are associated with an increased risk for mother of pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia, which could be monitored for more closely. ""Parents have more time and opportunity to arrange genetic and other expert counselling. ""Some parents might decide to proceed with the pregnancy but not take heroic measures [such as resuscitation] if the baby has a condition not compatible with life after birth."" If parents elected for a termination, the test enabled that to take place earlier in the pregnancy. ""An earlier decision reduces complexity and risks of termination,"" Dr Bopp said. Down Syndrome Australia chief executive Ellen Skladzien said the organisation would like to see more funding for women to receive better quality information and support before and after screening, before any test was subsidised. ""Families of children with Down syndrome have told us many stories about not receiving the right supports during pregnancy,"" Dr Skladzien said. ""It is unethical to implement a screening test in any population without providing the appropriate referrals and supports, including up-to-date and accurate information."" Dr Bopp said that, anecdotally, the test at present was only being offered to some groups of women because of its high price, usually to those using the private hospital system. He said that, typically, doctors would only offer it to women they deemed able to afford it, or in a high-risk group, such as older mothers. Figures show that, in Victoria, since NIPT became widely available, about one in three women have elected to have the test and pay the $500 price tag themselves. In its 2018 review on whether to fund the NIPT, the federal government's Medical Services Advisory Committee noted that a genetic counsellor informed them that many women missed out on NIPT because their doctor or midwife did not mention it to them. Further, the committee heard from clinicians that ""women often ask if they can pay for NIPT on a payment plan"". Complicating matters is that Medicare does subsidise an ultrasound at 13 weeks — called the nuchal translucency scan — which looks at a number of markers that overlap with the NIPT. ""The nuchal translucency scan looks at many other important things like pregnancy viability, the number and gestation [age] of the foetus and early structural assessment,"" Dr Bopp said. This is a similar screening test that looks for Down syndrome, based on the thickness of the baby's neck. If it is positive, women can proceed to have a test on their amniotic fluid or on the baby's placenta. While the scan could detect common genetic conditions, it was with ""lower sensitivity and specificity"" according to the government's own review. ""The DNA in the NIPT gives a more-accurate result for some chromosomal problems, but does not look at the baby, its heartbeat, structure and so on,"" Dr Bopp said. He also said the NIPT would be much simpler for those in regional and remote areas, rather than having to find a specialist maternal scanning clinic. In its 2018 decision, the federal government's Medical Services Advisory Committee did not support subsidising NIPT on ""cost-effectiveness grounds"". It found that funding the tests would cost the government an extra $100 million a year and only detect 195 extra cases of the three genetic conditions in the test, out of 1,080 cases that occurred annually. ""Due to the effectiveness of the existing prenatal testing options, the desirable consequences of augmenting this with the proposed testing, including for improved decision-making by patients and their care-givers, were too small,"" the committee found. This was despite finding that funding the test would lead to less people needing expensive amniocentesis or CVS tests, because a negative NIPT would rule out conditions early on. For Jacinta, any help with the antenatal costs would help her start off parenthood in front. ""I think it is just about looking after families and giving families information about what their families will look like in the future and that knowledge is powerful. It changes lives,"" she said.

78,"Worksites employing 700 West Australians with disabilities forced to close, sparking shock and anger",health,"  Funding changes to NDIS behind closure of Activ worksites as families left 'devastated' by decision Funding changes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) have forced Western Australia's largest disability services provider to close its industrial worksites, according to the organisation's chief executive. Many people in the disability community were ""devastated"" by Activ's announcement yesterday that it would close seven sites, which employ more than 700 people with disabilities across metropolitan and regional areas, including Bentley, Osborne Park, Bunbury and Geraldton. Activ CEO Michael Heath said the closures were due to funding cuts to the federally funded NDIS. Mr Heath told the ABC he had spoken to both the state and federal governments, but had not been able to secure any more funding to keep the sites going. ""That's really made it impossible for us to continue in our large-scale employment sites,"" Mr Heath said. ""The funding just doesn't support that business model. It's been changed in the last couple of years and that finds us in a situation where we're just not viable. ""Clearly, this is a time of great change, and it's a very difficult time … it's unfortunate but the speed we've had to move has really been because of the NDIS funding."" Activ will instead expand its community-based work to provide more personal attention from support workers in smaller settings, such as cleaning, maintenance and gardening. It also plans to establish a new academy to help people with disabilities develop social skills, live independently and access therapy. Two businesses lead the way in removing barriers to employing people with a disability. Mr Heath said while not everyone would choose to be re-employed in another role, support would be in place for those wanting to transition. ""We won't be leaving anybody behind, so if someone chooses to go another route, then there will be a redundancy payment in most cases,"" he said. ""We're meeting with every one of our people, one on one and their family, in an effort to talk to them about what they want to achieve and help them to do that."" In a statement, WA Minister for Disability Services Don Punch said the state government had raised concerns with the Commonwealth and agreed any disability employment support model should focus on individual needs. Mr Punch said he would have liked to have seen the Commonwealth give providers like Activ more time to implement new funding models as part of the transition from the Commonwealth Department of Social Services to the NDIS. Karen Sparling, who spoke on ABC Radio Perth, said her daughter Stephanie had been working at Activ's Osborne Park facility for the past 28 years. Ms Sparling said workers and staff were ""devastated"" and ""angry"" when they were told the news at a special meeting. She believes her daughter will be out of work for a while, and without a consistent routine. ""My daughter has an intellectual disability,"" she said. ""She doesn't write properly so she won't be able to apply for jobs. I'm going to have to do it. ""I'll have to take her to wherever she gets her job and pick her up afterwards, whereas now she goes to work on a bus and her bus delivers her home. ""What on Earth is she going to do all day? She won't have a purposeful job to go to."" ""What would she do at home on her own all day with nobody to mix with? [It'll be] very lonely."" Perth woman Gina told ABC Radio her daughter had been working at several Activ work sites for the past 10 years, since she was in year 12. ""The NDIS funding model, whatever is going on, I think it's somehow not translating [to] helping people where they need the help,"" she said. ""I don't know what it's going to mean for her. That's her community. ""She goes there three days a week. I understand they don't get the minimum wage, but that's not what work is always about. Long-running disability support service Activ Esperance announces its closure leaving 17 people with a disability unemployed. ""That (work) is her connection with other people. She feels useful. They do all these contracts that would otherwise probably not get filled because they're repetitive and not the most exciting, but for my daughter, she loves it. ""If she doesn't go there three days a week, what will she do?"" Federal Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese told ABC Radio Perth the federal government had failed to support people with a disability. ""There's been a massive disruption just before the election and I know that the consequences of that are significant when it comes to the provision of employment services across the country, but particularly in regional areas,"" he said. National Disability Services chief executive Laurie Leigh said her organisation was working with a number of WA disability service providers to identify a range of alternatives, including employment opportunities, for those affected. ""The decision made by Activ was partly due to financial pressures and, as one of the largest supported employment providers in Australia, is a clear example of the fate many more providers will face if the federal government does not support the disability employment sector through the transition period,"" Ms Leigh said. ""Without the option of supported employment for people with disability, many will go without employment altogether as we saw in the UK in 2012 after its government closed a number of supported employment services, leaving 1,700 people with disability without a job. ""Supported employment provides social, caring communities for those who would otherwise miss out, and ensuring this support is financially viable into the future is critical.""

79,Mystery hepatitis is spreading around the world. Will it reach Australia?,health," Health Health authorities around the world are continuing to investigate an outbreak of severe and unexplained hepatitis in children, with about 450 cases now reported worldwide. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver, often caused by a viral infection and generally rare in healthy children. The spate of unusual cases first came to global attention in April when UK health authorities reported higher than average rates of liver inflammation in children where the typical causes — hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E — were not detected. Such cases, though not unheard of, are generally rare, says Melbourne gastroenterologist Winita Hardikar. ""We would probably see five or six cases of severe, non A-E hepatitis in children each year, and one or two would need a transplant,"" said Professor Hardikar, head of the liver and intestinal transplantation unit at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. While most children recover from hepatitis, the severity of recent cases — most of which have occurred in children under the age of 5 — has concerned experts. Most children have reported gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting, before developing jaundice, a condition in which the skin and whites of the eyes turn yellow. In roughly 10 per cent of cases, children have required liver transplants, and according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 11 children have died. Cases have been identified in more than 20 countries, including in the United States, Israel, Indonesia and Japan. ""We haven't seen it yet [in Australia] … but obviously we've been alerted and we'll be on the lookout for it,"" Professor Hardikar said. After health authorities failed to find any evidence of the hepatitis viruses that most commonly cause liver inflammation, they began to look for common environmental exposures and toxins that might explain the outbreak. So far, none have been identified, but it's early days and ""everything is still on the table"", virologist Ian Mackay says. ""At the moment, the leading hypothesis is that it's something likely to be infectious,"" said Dr Mackay from the University of Queensland. ""The hardest thing is that there is no link epidemiologically to these cases — nothing to suggest they're being infected in the same household or same school. ""They haven't found a 'smoking virus' or 'smoking bacterium' that says: this is the thing in every person."" But health authorities in the UK have identified a number of clues and begun to narrow their focus. ""The leading hypotheses remain those which involve adenovirus,"" they wrote in their most recent technical briefing. ""However, we continue to investigate the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 and to work on ruling out any toxicological component."" More than 200,000 Australians are living with hepatitis B — about a third of whom don't know it. Adenovirus refers to a large family of common viruses that typically cause mild cold- and flu-like illnesses, as well as gastroenteritis and conjunctivitis. It's currently at the top of the suspect list because, in the UK at least, 72 per cent of children affected by the outbreak have also tested positive for an adenovirus. UK researchers have hypothesised that some children may have become more susceptible to adenovirus infections during the COVID-19 pandemic because public health measures and lockdowns have limited their exposure to viruses. They've also speculated that an ""exceptionally large wave of normal adenovirus infections"" may have unearthed a ""very rare or under-recognised complication"". But several experts, including Dr Mackay, have pointed out that adenovirus could just be a red herring. ""Most fingers are pointing to adenovirus simply because there have been a lot of adenovirus-positive samples … but it might be a bit misleading because adenovirus is quite a common virus,"" Dr Mackay said. ""It's worth remembering that a lot of these viruses have circulated even during lockdown."" Adenovirus also doesn't ""fully explain the severity of the clinical picture"", according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Further analysis of adenovirus-positive cases found they were consistent with adenovirus subtype 41, which is associated with symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain — not severe liver disease. Although adenoviruses have been known to cause rare cases of hepatitis in immunocompromised patients, they are not usually associated with liver problems in healthy children, Professor Hardikar said. ""Adenovirus is really not identified as a major cause of acute liver failure, so it's hard to make a link,"" she said. ""Unless it's a super potent virus, it's more likely that there is some other co-factor like an aberrant immune response or some other susceptibility."" Another working theory, as Professor Hardikar notes, is that a ""cofactor"" — such as a prior or existing infection with another virus like SARS-CoV-2 — may have primed some children to have a more severe reaction or abnormal immune response to adenovirus infection. According to UK health authorities, studies of the immune system are underway ""to determine if changes in susceptibility or the effect of prior or concurrent infections"" could be contributing factors. ""That might be a cofactor that relates to the child … a genetic predisposition, so that when they meet adenovirus 41, they're more likely to develop severe illness,"" said infectious disease physician and hepatitis researcher Andrew Lloyd of the Kirby Institute. ""It might be a cofactor in the form of another virus that is co-occurring, or it might be some other environmental factor … that sets up the risk for disease."" To date, only a small subset of children with hepatitis have tested positive for COVID-19, but more testing is underway to find out what proportion have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and have been infected in the past. Health authorities are also investigating the possibility of ""a post-infectious SARS-CoV-2 syndrome"". Professor Lloyd said he wasn't convinced the hepatitis cases were solely a complication of COVID-19, but post-viral phenomena — including abnormal immune responses — should be considered more broadly. Another possibility is that the outbreak is being driven by an entirely new virus, or a mutated version of adenovirus that hasn't been seen before. But Dr Mackay said low viral loads in the collected samples meant investigators hadn't yet managed to sequence a whole virus. ""So far, and it may just be because those analyses haven't been completed, nothing points to there being a brand new type of adenovirus,"" he said. ""But if we can't get those sequences, we can't be sure."" What is clear is that there is no evidence of a link between hepatitis cases and COVID-19 vaccines. ""The majority of cases are under 5 years old, and are too young to have received the vaccine,"" investigators said. Given the global nature of the outbreak, Dr Mackay said he expected Australia to see cases at some point. ""It's affecting more than 20 countries now, so I'd be very surprised if we didn't see it here."" Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice. But Professor Hardikar stressed that cases remain rare — even in countries like the UK — and that liver specialists had experience treating atypical hepatitis in children. ""We know about it, we haven't seen this yet, but it's reassuring that since last year, we haven't transplanted any child for this,"" she said. It's important for parents to be aware of the signs of hepatitis — particularly jaundice, dark urine, and light-coloured stools, as well as ""ongoing nausea and vomiting"", Professor Lloyd said. He added that it was also a good idea to keep up good hand and respiratory hygiene to reduce the spread of infections. ""Particularly in families where there are young kids, or venues where there are young kids, that means good hand washing and disinfecting surfaces in the bathroom and food-preparation areas in the kitchen.""

80,"Morrison 'not contemplating' quitting if he loses election, claims he can defy polls again",health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Prime Minister Scott Morrison claims he can defy national opinion polls and win Saturday's federal election, saying Australians want him to be a ""more inclusive"" Prime Minister if he gets another term in power. Despite the upbeat message, some of his Liberal colleagues are increasingly worried the national polls are suggesting a Labor landslide is the most likely outcome this weekend. The opposition believes it is competitive or in front in a swathe of seats. It needs to win just seven to claim a majority, while the government cannot afford to lose any. But in a wide-ranging interview with 7.30 about his prospects and time in office, the Prime Minister declared he was not thinking about standing down after Saturday's poll, even in the event of a defeat or a hung parliament. ""No, that is not something I'm contemplating because I'm not contemplating that being the scenario,"" Mr Morrison said. Josh Frydenberg, or possibly Peter Dutton, are considered the most likely to be the next Liberal leaders should the Coalition lose, though that would be dependent on both men retaining their seats and the final numbers in the party room. Some independent candidates, like Zali Steggall, have already indicated they would be unlikely to support the Coalition in the event of a hung parliament if Mr Morrison remained leader. The Prime Minister said he would accept the outcome of the election because he trusted the choices Australians made at the ballot box, but he would not ""speculate"" on what could happen on Saturday. ""I'm focused on one thing and that's ensuring our government continues,"" he added. ""The only person who has announced their retirement is you, Leigh, and I wish you very well in your retirement."" In another concession that his personal popularity was a drag on the government's vote in some key seats, the Prime Minister again suggested he would change if given a second chance. ""People really just want to see me be more inclusive in terms of how I go forward,"" he said, rejecting claims voters were angry with him because he had not taken responsibility for some of the government's failures. ""They're Labor's criticisms,"" he added. But he did suggest he may have alienated some voters by ""acting decisively"" during the pandemic. ""During the course of a crisis and a pandemic, you've got to move fast, you've got to be decisive and that means sometimes you can't take everybody with you and you don't always get everything right either,"" Mr Morrison said. ""But in the next phase, then we've got the opportunity to bring people forward on that plan. ""I'll tell you one thing, the only way Australians are going to be able to get access to their superannuation to buy their own home is if they vote Liberal and National, because the Labor Party will never do it."" Liberals concede the Prime Minister and his Deputy, the Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, are unpopular in some inner-city seats in Sydney and Melbourne that are being targeted by independents backed by the Climate 200 group. As a result, Mr Morrison's campaign has mostly targeted seats in suburban and regional areas in a bid to take electorates off Labor. ""Many of these places, [inner-city seats] I suppose, are less vulnerable to the impacts of the economy than, say, many of the places I've been in this campaign,"" he said, when asked why some traditionally Liberal heartland seats were under threat. ""But I do know this, you can't address climate change and invest in the technology you need to deal with climate change unless you have a strong economy."" Senior members of the Labor opposition remain deeply scarred after losing the 2019 election and some refuse to believe the situation is as rosy as the polls make out. That said, a number believe the party has successfully stuck to its strategy over the past three years. ""I know people will pick over this next week when it's all done and dusted, but from my point of view, it's gone to plan,"" Shadow Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said. ""It was about looking at Anthony's leadership, it was about looking at what happened in 2019, what went wrong, laying down the things you want to campaign on, putting the policy work together, and in this fourth quarter … kicking with the wind."" However, in a sign of how nervous the Labor Party remains about this campaign, she immediately added: ""Touch wood.""

81,Model describes 'dehumanising' airport treatment after coming off wheelchair,health,"  Airports and airlines on notice after people with disability speak out about humiliating treatment More people with disability have come forward, describing ""dehumanising"" treatment at airports across the country, after Australia's former disability discrimination commissioner spoke out about his recent experience at Adelaide Airport. Graeme Innes said he was refused access to use the body scanner and was asked to use a walk-through X-ray scanner at the airport on Friday. He said a security guard then decided he needed a pat-down, despite him not triggering the security alarm, which had instead been set off by his dog's metal harness. Further accounts have since emerged from airport passengers with disability who say they have been subjected to rough handling, including model and disability access consultant Akii Ngo. Akii was on a high, returning home via Adelaide from Australian Fashion Week in Sydney, where they participated as a model in the ""Fix The System Not Me"" adaptive clothing collective show. But Akii said that when they were being transported in the airline's wheelchair through Adelaide Airport, Jetstar staff seemed to lack experience when handling people who required mobility support. ""We were on the flight bridge, there's a lot of bumps — essentially they pushed me too hard, I fell right out of the chair,"" Akii said. ""The first thing the staff member said was: 'You should have held on tighter.' ""I couldn't get up — it was dehumanising."" In an Instagram post, Akii said the experience was ""horrible"" and ""terrible"". A Jetstar spokesperson said staff were ""well trained to provide assistance to customers requiring wheelchairs"", and said the airline had since reached out to Akii. ""A number of team members attended to assist the customer on the aerobridge, and assisted them through the airport to the baggage carousel,"" the spokesperson said. ""We've also reached out to the customer several times yesterday and today to better understand their experience and are waiting to hear back. ""We continue to investigate what happened in this instance."" Former FIFO worker Viv Bachelier — who worked as a psychologist for the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) — said she had had dozens of humiliating experiences while transiting through Adelaide Airport security with her guide dog. On one occasion, she said, a security staff member told her she was going through the wrong security lane. ""I said, 'I'm sorry, I'm standing here with my guide dog. I can't see what lane I'm supposed to go down',"" Ms Bachelier recalled. ""He said, 'How am I supposed to know you're with a guide dog? You're not wearing a vision impaired badge – you should be wearing one of those badges.' ""I said: 'Excuse me? That's not my responsibility to tell you I have a disability'."" Ms Bachelier, from Canberra, said she had so many belittling experiences at the airport that she started asking airline staff to assist her through security. ""[The security staff] would use really generic terms — 'just come over here, put that there',"" Ms Bachelier said. ""When you're vision impaired you don't have those concepts — you can't see."" An Adelaide Airport spokesperson said it had not received any notification about the incidents, but would ""welcome"" a chance to discuss possible improvements. ""We weren't aware of the concerns raised by the customer,"" the spokesperson said. ""We would welcome an opportunity to speak with her so we can help make her journey through Adelaide Airport more smooth in the future and we can further improve how our teams support customers with a disability."" Perth woman Filipa Scott said she had made recent complaints to Perth Airport about security's treatment of her 17-year-old daughter, who has autism and PTSD. Her daughter, Myles, uses an assistance dog, and Ms Scott said she was not allowed to use the body scanner and was asked to go through a side gate and have a physical pat-down. ""It's a huge issue for a someone with enormous sensory issues,"" Ms Scott said. ""We offered for her to go through the main scanner with myself in charge of the dog, then let the dog go through and be scanned and [be] patted down, then for myself to go through. ""They refused, stating they could not separate daughter and dog — even if this process was traumatising for her."" Ms Scott said a few months later her daughter tried to pass the same security again, and had to convince staff to use an alternative security check — using the email received from Perth Airport apologising for the first incident. ""No-one should have to go to that level — I think the workers need to hear from people with actual experience [of disability],"" she said. A Perth Airport spokesperson said all security staff undertook additional training on screening passengers with assistance animals and alternative screening methods after Myles's experience. ""Although the screening procedure was carried out correctly and professionally, the use of a handheld metal detector may have been the most suitable method of security screening in this instance,"" the spokesperson said. ""A detailed response and apology was provided to the passengers following this investigation.""

82,Doctor shortages have 'huge' consequences. Mallee candidates share their healthcare plans,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes People in western Victoria are being diagnosed with serious illnesses later, and sometimes too late to save their lives, because of the region's medical workers' shortage, the Rural Doctors Association of Australia president Megan Belot says. Government data compiled by the Western Victoria Primary Health Network shows the number of general practitioners in the electorate of Mallee is well below the Victorian and national averages. There are 76 general practitioners for every 100,000 people in the electorate compared to 91 on average across Victoria and 97 across the country. The numbers per patient are worse for dentists (39 per cent below the Victorian average) and much worse for psychologists (82 per cent lower). ""The consequences are huge,"" Dr Belot, a general practitioner and anaesthetist working in Cohuna, Echuca and Kerang, said. ""Not only will you have more acute presentations to your emergency departments ... but you're also seeing people coming in with cancer diagnosis much later, needing much more further intervention [including] further surgery, more intense chemotherapy or radiotherapy. ""But even ... suffering the severe consequence of actually dying from their disease that maybe if they'd got it treated 12 months earlier, they would have been curable."" The shortage of GPs and specialists across the medical profession are nothing new in the region. But Dr Belot said COVID had made the problem significantly worse. The ABC asked each Mallee candidate what they would do to improve local healthcare and medical staff shortages if elected. Candidates are listed in the order they appear on the ballot paper. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Nationals MP Anne Webster is the incumbent in Mallee. She said being a member of the government had enabled her to secure a series of healthcare outcomes for the electorate. Among them, she listed the retention of Medicare-funded telehealth; increased hospital funding, including $30 million for the Swan Hill hospital; 80 new Commonwealth-supported places at regional universities; and the reimbursement of university fees for medical degrees in the region. Dr Webster said she had been working with hospitals, and with La Trobe and Monash universities, to deliver a tri-state training hospital for Mildura. She also said a returned Coalition government would spend $3.3 million on facilities for an undergraduate biomedical course in Mildura. ""Research shows if we do this, [medical students] are 75-80 per cent more likely to stay local,"" she said. Dr Webster noted aged care ""received a boost in the federal budget with 15,000 training places for upskilling"". ""The delivery of regional MRI's with MBS rebate has been welcomed also,"" she said. ""If the Coalition is returned to government we will also deliver $35 million in new funding to significantly expand the successful Innovative Models of Collaborative Care program across rural and regional Australia from 1 January 2023. ""The program will attract, support and retain rural health professionals to deliver care on the ground. ""I will fight for Mallee to be a site for this program."" Sophie Baldwin argued Mallee needed a ""flexible model of care to suit the country"" where telehealth and nurse practitioners could help take pressure off local GPs. She is also in favour of incentives for GPs to practice in the region and investment in housing and daycare. ""It is hard to attract a GP to the area if you don't have suitable housing or daycare,"" she said. ""It's also a catch 22 if a town only has one doctor, the burnout factor is high and GPs soon move on. ""Doctors need to be better supported in the country whether through financial/HECS incentives and appropriately paid multi-skilled staff to help take the pressure off."" Ms Baldwin argued for a ""templated approach, to be fine-tuned from community to community"". ""[To] achieve those goals, Mallee needs a committed member."" Claudia Haenel said she would ""ensure GPs weren't ripped out of the bush"". ""We need to keep and retain medical staff, having them train here,"" she said. ""After kids finish year 12, if they could be here and train through local TAFE or uni, and we can make use of our tertiary education facilities here in Horsham, then we can keep them. ""We also have to ensure Medicare is not going to get cut any further. ""We need to ensure we get more services in the bush rather than less. ""For people to have to travel ... down the road to Ballarat for a 10-minute appointment which could be done in our local area, particularly when our roads aren't adequate, it's very dangerous."" Ms Haenel also argued for National Disability Insurance Scheme reform. ""We need to ensure ... that when people are given services or their NDIS is able to pay for services for recipients, that those services can be accessed here, to enable the health service funding,"" she said. Christoper Lahy called for a ""dramatic increase"" in medical staff across specialties and across the national health system. He argued that ""decades of ideologically driven under-resourcing, profiteering, and outsourcing to management consultants"" had caused the public health system to become overwhelmed, even before the pandemic. ""[Federal] and state governments have overseen woefully inadequate responses, defaulting to short-term, bandaid measures and resorting to extreme restrictions and mandates as a substitute for properly resourcing public health care,"" he said. Mr Lahy said better conditions in health facilities would encourage medical professionals who have left their job to return. He argued a key method for attracting and retaining young people in the local medical profession would be to pursue better funding for Monash School of Rural Health and the development of the La Trobe University Mildura hospital training precinct. Mr Lahy said these policies would be funded through a publicly-owned Commonwealth Postal Savings Bank or National Infrastructure Bank. Carole Hart did not respond to requests to comment for this story, but her party has made several promises that it says would make it easier to see a doctor if it wins government. In its health policy document, Labor has pledged to ""boost workforce incentives for rural and regional GPs to support the engagement of nurses, allied health and other health professionals and provide multidisciplinary team-based care"". Labor has detailed plans to expand the Innovative Models of Collaborative Care program across rural and regional Australia ""to attract, support and retain rural health professionals"". It also has plans to expand the John Flynn Prevocational Doctor Program to more than 1,000 placements in rural Australia per year, and ""strengthen rural generalist and GP registrar training"". ""All Australians deserve access to universal, prompt, and world class medical care, and no one deserves to face a multi-year wait for vital treatments simply due to the cost,"" the policy document says. The party has vowed to ""change the rules to allow regional and outer metro communities to recruit more doctors of their choosing"", expand the newborn screening program, and improve pandemic preparedness and response by setting up an Australian Centre for Disease Control. Labor also pledged to deliver 50 Medicare urgent care centres, which would bulk bill, for conditions like a broken bone or an insect bite. Sam McColl says his experience working as an operations officer with St John Ambulance helps him understand the importance of what he describes as ""a properly funded health care system"". ""Healthcare is getting more and more expensive, and too many people can't afford to access dental or mental health care,"" he said. Mr McColl cited the Greens' national platform in response to questions about how he would improve healthcare and the medical staff shortage in Mallee. He says the party's policies are to add dental and mental health care on to Medicare and make telehealth a permanent feature of the scheme. Other initiatives include reinvesting ""the billions paid in private health insurance rebates back into the public system"" to reduce out-of-pocket costs, to fund hospitals and clear public hospital surgery waiting lists and spend an extra $8 billion by legislating equal funding of hospitals between the Commonwealth and states. Asked whether he or his party had any health policies specific to the region, Mr McColl said the Greens did not have specific policies for individual seats. ""All our policies are for the many, not the few."" Stuart King argued the key to attracting and retaining medical professionals was better quality health facilities and financial incentives to practice in the regions. He said the United Australia Party’s plan for healthcare involved a 20 per cent regional tax concession, $40 billion for hospital infrastructure, abolishing fees for university and TAFE and forgiving existing HECS debts. ""This will bring direct benefit to Mallee healthcare infrastructure and service delivery by providing better facilities and higher wages to attract and retain healthcare professionals in the Mallee,"" Mr King said. ""We will [also] invest in education and community facilities which will also support existing residents and attract new ones including healthcare professionals."" The United Australia Party has proposed a 15 per cent licence fee on Australian iron ore exports to fund the repayment of government debt. The savings on interest payments, Mr King said, would directly fund the proposals. Vanessa Atkinson did not respond to the ABC's attempts to contact her for comment. She is among about a dozen ""ghost"" candidates running for Pauline Hanson's One Nation this election who have not been seen or heard actively campaigning in the electorates they are contesting.

83,Two COVID-19 deaths in SA as state government launches primary school vaccination hubs ,health,"  Two people with COVID-19 have died in South Australia as the state government launches an initiative to increase the vaccination rate among children. SA Health has reported 3,392 new COVID-19 cases today, the lowest figure since last Monday, following a spike in numbers over the past week. The two deaths were a man and a woman, both in their 70s. Yesterday, 3,796 new cases were reported, following 3,816 on Saturday. There are now 248 people with COVID-19 in hospital, including seven people in intensive care. Forty schools across Adelaide and regional South Australia will be used as vaccination hubs in an effort to boost the low inoculation rate among children aged between five and 11-years-old. The program will roll out to 10 schools at a time, over a four-week period beginning on Friday, May 27. The hubs will be repeated in another nine weeks for second doses. Friday clinics will be limited to students and family members, while the wider community will be able to get vaccinated on the Saturdays. Thirty of the schools are in Adelaide, 10 are in regional areas and six are non-government schools. So far only 59 per cent of SA children aged five to 11 have had at least their first vaccine dose, compared with 96 per cent of the state's population aged 12 and over. Education Minister Blair Boyer said the schools were chosen because they were ""in a local government area where there is a lower vaccination rate than what we would like"". ""That is the information that we have used as a basis for choosing all the 40 sites, including 10 regional and six non-government,"" Mr Boyer said. However, some of the schools chosen — such as Glenelg, Brighton, Magill, Berri, Risdon Park and Greenwith primary schools — are in council areas with a 16-plus vaccination rate above 95 per cent. Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier welcomed the initiative, which she said would be particularly important to protect children who got COVID-19 and also had other health issues, such as asthma, heart conditions or epilepsy. ""When you look at our children vaccine numbers, they are really lagging behind, and as a paediatrician I want children to have as good a health care — if not better — than adults so I'm really pleased the Education Minister and the government are bringing in this initiative for families,"" she said. A Community Vaccination Day with free transport to hubs will be held on May 28. Clinics will be set up at council offices in Salisbury, Campbelltown, Playford, Tea Tree Gully, Port Adelaide Enfield, West Torrens, Port Pirie, the Adelaide Plains and the Barossa Valley. Professor Spurrier said nine children in South Australia had developed paediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome (PIMS-TS) since the start of the pandemic, out of 96 across Australia. PIMS-TS can occur in children two to six weeks after contracting COVID-19. Weeks after recovering from COVID-19, a small number of children start coming down with a mysterious illness. As Omicron causes a surge in cases, parents are being encouraged to keep a lookout for symptoms. The rare but potentially life-threatening condition has symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain and a rash, and can mimic acute appendicitis symptoms. ""That also is prevented through vaccination,"" Professor Spurrier said. Naomi Dallenogare's children Mila and Harvey were among the first children under 12 to receive their vaccination in January. She said the hub was a good idea, although there had been little disruption at Marryatville Primary School, where her children went. ""Anything we can do to be more accessible and give people the opportunity to get vaccinated is incredibly important,"" she said. The Education Minister said 5,620 South Australian school students had contracted COVID-19 in term 1, along with 847 staff. Until Friday in term 2, a total of 3,173 had tested positive for the virus, he said, along with 589 staff. Mr Boyer said a decision on whether to remove the requirement for masks at high schools would be made by the start of week five, which is May 30. ""My hope is figures stay steady and we can be in a position to remove masks at the end of the four-week period, but we'll make a decision closer to that date,"" he said.

84,Medical groups renew calls for fresh WA COVID restrictions as hospital cases surge to 314 ,health,"  Peak medical groups have renewed their calls for the West Australian government to reinstate public health measures, warning of a ""system collapse"" from the state's current trajectory of COVID-19 hospitalisations. There are now 314 people in hospital with the virus, which has breached the threshold that medical experts say should trigger the reintroduction of restrictions like the mask mandate. Both the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Nursing Federation have today repeated calls for public health measures to be reintroduced. ANF Secretary Mark Olson — who spoke virtually today due to being a close contact — refuted Mr McGowan's claims that COVID-19 hospital admissions were under control. ""You've got record ambulance ramping, and it looks like we're on track for another record month,"" Mr Olson said. Meanwhile, AMA WA president Mark Duncan-Smith said he expected the number of people in hospital with COVID-19 to reach 400 in the next one to two weeks. ""The hospital system is going to show major stress and crisis for the next two weeks, including increased critical ramping, critical ambulance shortages … increased furloughing of staff,"" he said. ""We're going to get critical problems, which are direct result of that inability to act and reintroduce masks."" Dr Duncan-Smith said Fiona Stanley Hospital's emergency department was full and there were no beds in its ICU. ""That's not scaremongering. That's fact."" The number of new COVID-19 cases fell marginally today, to 12,266. The WA government has to pass new legislation every time it wants to extend its pandemic powers. This is what it means and why it is important. The government has flagged hospital admissions and intensive care figures as the numbers to watch. However, despite the spike in the number of people in hospital, the Health Minister said the load still fell within a manageable range. Instead, Amber-Jade Sanderson pointed at staff furlough figures as the critical number now affecting health services, with about 2,200 staff absent due to being sick or needing to isolate. ""The number that's challenging hospitals at the moment is not so much hospitalisations, but [furloughing of] staff. That's the number we're watching,"" Ms Sanderson said. St John WA yesterday issued a public alert for the second time in a week over a delay in ambulances reaching people in need, due to ""extremely high demand"" and COVID-19 cutting through the workforce. The ambulance service also issued a public alert last Monday, highlighting hospital ramping and an influx of COVID--related call-outs as contributing factors. It was the first time St John had directly appealed to the public about delays to its services. St John WA CEO Michelle Fyfe said the second alert was unlikely to be the last. ""I actually won't be doing a press conference every time we do this now,"" she said. ""I've got 108 paramedics across the organisation who are on COVID leave, and the majority of those are COVID-positive."" Ms Fyfe said St John's staffing levels were down about 10 per cent today and warned the upcoming flu season would compound the already dire situation. ""We are moving into what is traditionally the most busy time for ambulances,"" she said. ""I like to think there's light at the end of the tunnel but, right now, we're just going to deal with the situation that we have in front of us."" The total number of active COVID-19 cases in Western Australia has more than doubled, to 88,934, since restrictions eased three weeks ago. While the spike in COVID-19 hospital admissions has not sparked new restrictions, Premier Mark McGowan has yet to rule out a potential reintroduction of public health measures. ""The state is doing far better than any of the modelling indicated, but what we will do is monitor,"" he said. However, it is up for debate whether Western Australia is doing better than the modelling indicated. While the number of occupied ICU beds is still falling far short of the peak in the Department of Health's modelling, other figures have been outstripped. Confirmed cases so far: 660,064 Active cases: 87,103 Cases in hospital: 323 Deaths: 216 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 81.3 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department There have been 52 days so far where 200 or more hospital beds have been occupied by people with COVID-19, while the modelling only predicted a peak of 40 days. Western Australia is still sitting far below the expected peak in daily case numbers, which Mr McGowan said could reach around 25,000 — more than double today's figures — according to the Chief Health Officer. Despite that, the Premier did not want to identify a specific threshold for when restrictions would potentially be brought back. ""We haven't ruled out bringing in further restrictions, but we're very reluctant to do so,"" he said. In the midst of appeals to the public from St John WA about the strain on ambulance services, and the calls from medical experts to bring back restrictions, Mr McGowan said COVID-19 in Western Australia was still ""manageable"".

86,How to vote if you have COVID-19 on election day,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Earlier this week, the ABC reported the Australian Electoral Commission confirmed people who have COVID-19 may not be able to vote in the federal election. But the Australian electoral commissioner requested changes, which have been accepted by the government. All Australians with COVID-19 will now be eligible for telephone voting. The original legislation meant anyone who tested positive before May 17 but did not apply for a postal ballot could not vote on the phone. Here's what you need to know about voting if you have COVID. If you test positive for COVID-19 or are in isolation as of 6pm on Friday, May 20, you are eligible for telephone voting. Telephone voting is an emergency service that has been introduced for voters forced to isolate with the virus. However, the AEC says you ""may not be able to vote"" if: ""The intention of the legislation is for each cohort of voters to have an option available to them & for people to plan their vote,"" the AEC said on Twitter. An AEC spokesperson said ""relevant health authorities"" had been sending COVID-positive Australians text messages and emails ""about their voting options since Saturday"". Yes. You will need to provide proof of a positive COVID test from either a PCR test or a rapid antigen test (RAT). Tests must also be registered with your state or territory health authority. Voters will need to provide proof of the date and time of their positive PCR result or the serial number of their RAT. The AEC says voters will have to go through a few steps to access telephone voting. You will need to register on the AEC website before 4pm AEST on election day, Saturday, May 21. Once there, you will need to provide evidence of being COVID-positive and make a declaration about your eligibility. You will then be matched to the electoral roll. Checks will also be made to confirm that you have not already voted by telephone or another method. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The AEC says the service will be available to those who are required to be in COVID isolation on the following days: No. Phone voting is a service that is traditionally only available to people who are visually impaired or working in Antarctica. Australian Electoral Commissioner Tom Rogers stresses that turning out to voting centres is preferred. ""It is and will be an emergency measure for a very limited number of Australians,"" Mr Rogers told the ABC in February. ""The absolute preference will be, if you can, you should be in the line rather than on the line."" Close contacts are no longer required to isolate in any Australian state or territory. The AEC says it expects voters to follow local health guidelines when they vote. No. Thousands of new staff have been hired to help with the process. When we asked about phone voting, this is the first thing the AEC said: ""Electoral integrity is at the core of every aspect of the AEC's service delivery and is paramount in our planning of the emergency telephone voting solution we're delivering."" They say phone voting will have the same level of supervision as every other voting service they run. They also said that their systems have undergone cyber-security assessments. What does the process of voting actually look like? ""Telephone voting operators will be supervised and the voting process will be open to candidate and party-appointed scrutineers to observe,"" they said. ""[It's] a key part of the transparency of Australia's election delivery. ""The ballot paper handling requirements in call centres will be subject to the same stringent ballot paper handling and reconciliation requirements as in-person polling places."" The AEC said votes would only be counted under scrutineer observation following the secure return to divisional offices.

87,Businesses aren't going broke. Experts are worried it will create a bigger problem,health,"  As the pandemic roared in during early 2020, rapid and astonishing shifts were made to prop up an economy sledgehammered by lockdowns, restrictions and fear. 'Safe harbour' insolvency laws were written to protect companies unable to predict future turnover. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) stopped pursuing debts as the pandemic unfolded. Tens of billions of dollars in stimulus were pumped into the economy. And, as a result, businesses stopped going broke. However, even as the economy recovers to a new kind of normal, the number of businesses going into administration each year is thousands below pre-pandemic levels. ""There are definitely businesses that, in ordinary times, would have gone under that were able to continue trading,"" Scott Mason of credit reporting agency Equifax says. However, the drought of insolvencies doesn't mean that companies are necessarily doing better. Instead, there are distressed companies still operating that should have been killed off long ago — taking people's money even as they circle the drain. And Scott Mason says that's a big problem for their customers and suppliers. ""The real issue is you don't, as a normal consumer, always know who those companies are … so I think there is some danger to people who enter into business with them."" Since 2020, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) hasn't been chasing outstanding debts. That knock on the door is often the trigger for a company to enter administration, so there's been a drought of insolvencies, a slump so stark many insolvency practitioners had to access the JobKeeper wage subsidy themselves to keep their doors open. Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) data reveals that in the two-and-a-quarter years since the pandemic began in Australia, just 10,530 businesses have entered administration. That's fewer than went under in the separate financial years of 2008, 2011 or 2012. The 10-year average of companies going into administration is 9,300 a year. ""I think, over the coming months, we will start to see some movement in insolvency,"" says Robyn Esrkine, partner of insolvency firm Brooke Bird, ""and I think that's going to be upwards."" She says law changes, programs like JobKeeper and the ATO giving companies a reprieve from paying tax debts changed the usual cycle of business that sees almost 10,000 go under in a normal year. ""But we're back, we're operating in a COVID economy and businesses need to be viable to be able to contribute to the economy."" That means a likely increase in companies going into insolvency, Ms Erskine says. ""I think that those businesses that haven't been able to pay their debt — and we know that there is a lot of unpaid taxes, there was a lot going into COVID — those businesses now are going to be asked to pay."" In the ATO's 2020-21 annual report, total debt was $58.8 billion, and just 65 per cent of that — $38.5 billion — was ""collectable"", meaning likely to be paid. Most of that owed, achievable debt is owed by small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). Previously, secret documents revealed public and media pressure stopped the tax office going harder in pursing debts owed by small businesses struggling through the COVID-19 pandemic. Freedom of information documents reveal tax leniency was shown to small businesses with debts during the pandemic, but now the ATO is changing its tune. The reports — obtained using the Freedom of Information (FOI) process — reveal the ATO set up a softer approach during COVID, sending text messages, sending blue rather than ""firmer"" orange letters, and a move away from ""stronger action"" in ""favour (of) help and assistance"" for small business. However, the amnesty is now over. The tax office wants its money. Also revealed in the documents, a successful threat to dob in companies with tax debts to credit-reporting agencies, which could cause those companies' clients to stop doing business with them. ""The outcome we are seeking is behavioural change and engagement rather than actual disclosure,"" the document reads, outlining the gambit. It worked. Notices of the threat were sent to 70 companies in August last year. All but one paid up, a total of $6.5 million came in, and no companies were dobbed in. As of August 31, 2021, the tax office had issued 842,845 reminder letters, with around 55 per cent of them going to small business. At the time of contacting the ATO for this article, it had sent out letters warning about outstanding debts to 29,552 businesses. A further 52,319 letters warning about the potential for Director Penalty Notices (DPNs) were sent to people in charge of these companies. Tax commissioner Chris Jordan told senators in February that the ATO was taking a measured approach. ""We are concerned that the longer businesses stay out of engagement with us, the more problematic the collection of those debts is,"" he told the Senate. ""It is something we cannot just ignore, because the debt stock has gone up about 14 per cent from the same time last year and is now around $40 billion. ""We have to focus in as empathetic way as we can, but it is something we just have to get on with."" Scott Mason is general manager of commercial and property services at Equifax, one of the companies that would have been ""dobbed to"" had the ATO's gambit been unsuccessful. He sees danger ahead as companies that should have gone under a long time ago are forced to wind up. ""A lot of those companies continue to survive where, ordinarily, they may well have gone under,"" he says. In the past two years there's been a lot of discussion of so-called ""zombie businesses"", artificially propped-up by the JobKeeper wage subsidy, low interest rates and the tax debt moratorium. Now rates are rising and those supports are gone, so the pressure is on. Mr Mason says small operators are dipping into their personal finances, a sign of growing stress. ""Looking at sole traders, small proprietors, sort of those 'smaller-end-of-town' operators, [they] are twice as likely to have their personal mortgages in arrears as the general population. ""So, clearly, there's some pressure down at that end of the market."" The problem is acute in the construction industry. Iconic firm Grocon collapsed in 2020 and this year mega-builder ProBuild — with its $5 billion pipeline of work — fell over. Since then, ABD Group, Privium Home, Condev and, most recently, Next, went under. Building costs have risen so much that one construction professional says he goes to work every day knowing he'll ""disappoint at least one person"". Equifax data suggests that, while the overall rate of insolvencies in March 2022 was up 5 per cent on last year, construction insolvencies were 28 per cent higher. In the first quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2021, 270 construction companies filled for insolvency, a 21 per cent jump. Stretched global supply chains have fed into soaring costs for materials. Ongoing border closers boosted a hot labour market, meaning tradespeople have been charging more. ""It's created a 'profitless boom', with many construction companies committed to projects that are no longer financially viable, thanks to major price increases for building materials,"" Mr Mason says. Anneke Thompson, the chief economist for credit reporting firm CreditorWatch, agrees. ""Over the last few years margins have really compressed,"" she says. ""The risk profile of the whole construction sector is worsening."" The issue with construction is that intense competition meant some companies won contracts that left them with only thin profit margins. With skyrocketing costs — and being unable to recoup them — they're losing money on the deals. ""Fixed pricing is a real problem for the sector,"" she says. ""In other industries, when their costs rise or fall, they can change their pricing. ""You see the evidence of that at the supermarket. When you buy fruit and vegetables, the prices are changing, based on their costs. ""The construction industry can't do that."" The danger for consumers — and people working in construction — is that it's often hard to tell if a company is in trouble, until it's too late. ""It's difficult to see from the outside,"" Ms Thompson says. ""A lot of these businesses will look like they're operating normally: They'll be paying their wages, they'll be keeping the lights on. But their balance sheets and their financial position might be very stressed."" Research from CreditorWatch suggests the hospitality and entertainment industries are currently the sectors with companies at the greatest risk of default, ahead of even construction. For OptiPay chief executive Angus Sedgwick, a surge in new customers is a sign companies are stretched. ""Particularly, the construction industry is under pressure because of, obviously, the supply chain issues and the inflationary pressure that [have] caused increases in the cost of materials,"" Mr Sedgwick says. ""And many of these builders and developers have entered into fixed-price contracts, so that they've got to absorb all these increases in costs."" However, Mr Sedgwick is confident the tax office will take slow steps. ""They won't have just come through these last two-and-a-half years of the pandemic to then suddenly wind everyone up. But if you don't be proactive, that's what will end up happening over the next six, eight months."" OptiPay is in the business of invoice financing. Here's how that works: Dave's Concreting has done a job for a big client and is owed $10,000 in two months. An invoice financing company buys the debt, pays Dave 90 per cent of it in cash immediately and eventually receives the invoice's value, profiting from the 10 per cent leftover. It's very common in the US and UK, and is a long-standing way for companies to improve their cash flow that helps to get money coming in more quickly to balance payments going out. ""If you are selling your goods or services on credit, you're effectively giving your goods or services away for free for that credit period,"" Mr Sedgwick explains. But it's not without controversy, most recently the focus was on the collapse of globe-trotting firm Greensill Capital. The increasing popularity of this type of business goes some way to explaining why the victims of corporate collapses in the field of construction are often small-to-medium-sized subcontracting companies — ""subbies"" — that are not household names. ""Most subcontractors — whether they be plumbers, chippies, whatever they might be — generally have two to three months of their own expenses into a job before they put in their progress claim,"" Mr Sedgwick explains. ""So they're always running about two to three months of expenses and bills and subcontractors' wages, etc., that they've got to fund before the debtor — whoever that may be, that they're doing the work for — actually pays them."" The model means the subbies are outlaying money — services, staff and supplies — and relying on companies to pay them months after the costs have been sunk. ""If, in the month of May, they put their progress claim in, that will get paid in mid-July. So, typically, there's two to three months of a subbies work in a job before they received the payment for it."" This means a host of small companies can spend a lot of money before the music stops and things fall apart. Equifax's Scott Mason is confident about what will unfold as the tax office restarts its normal business collecting revenue owed to it. ""What you have seen is — on the good side — you've got still a lot of availability of funds [and] people are still trying to lend. We've got a lot of good consumer confidence still, and business confidence in the market,"" he says. Ms Erskine — who sits on the board of INSOL, a world-wide federation of insolvency experts — is not bracing for a rush of troubled companies. ""I think it might be a slow burn,"" she says, seeing the turnover of unviable firms as a healthy part of the economic cycle. ""These zombie businesses suck resources,"" she argues. ""So, it is in everyone's interest that viable businesses are supported, that they have an even playing ground — that they're not competing against businesses who are not paying their taxes and not paying their employees — for our country to move forward and prosper, which is what we all want.""

88,Australia led the world in COVID infections this week and the experts say 'it's not over',health,"  This week Australia became a world leader. But it wasn't for a feat of engineering or some sort of sporting achievement — it was an unwelcome title. According to global databases, Australia led the world in per-capita COVID infections (if you ignore the tiny islands of Montserrat, Anguilla and The Falklands). On Friday, 54,591 cases were reported across Australia, on the back of two consecutive days of about 58,000 cases, with Western Australia bracing for new infection records. Saturday's numbers moved the official seven-day average to more than 48,000 daily cases, putting Australia behind only Germany and the US in total new daily cases recorded. The data tracking Australia's COVID-19 developments provide a guide to how the country is faring in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Some countries, such as Denmark, have scrapped COVID-19 testing recommendations, and others have scaled back testing regimes, meaning getting like-for-like comparisons across the world is now more difficult. However in Australia, hospitalisations and deaths are also tracking upwards, with the average number of COVID-related daily deaths hitting 40, doubling since March. But with the country in the middle of an election campaign — in which COVID barely gets a mention — a war raging in Ukraine, the cost of living rising and following more than two years COVID restrictions, the virus has, understandably to some, dropped off the radar. And the experts understand. ""I'm over it,"" Burnet Institute chief executive Brendan Crabb said. ""We all are. ""But the numbers we are seeing in Australia are extraordinary. So many people are very, very sick. ""Yet, there's a massive disconnect between what's happening with these disruptions to our lives and why it's happening."" For Professor Crabb, the ""disconnect"" comes back to what he describes as a fear of ""COVID of the past"" and ""COVID now"". He said after two years of extreme impacts, governments and politicians were now afraid to talk about COVID. Instead, he said, they had removed mask mandates and kept their ""heads in the sand"", ignoring the key element of why cases — and hospitalisations — had now increased: transmission. And ""COVID now"", he said, was having a massive impact on society. ""Remember, lots of COVID is bad for business,"" he said. ""We can't ignore that. We've been seeing that for months. ""And as a nation, we're also ignoring the health impact. How many of the 350,000-plus active cases in Australia right now will have chronic impacts? Overseas data suggests 10 per cent of them. And that will impact your heart, impact your lungs, organs and brain. ""It's not nothing."" According to University of Melbourne epidemiologist Nancy Baxter, the numbers may ""get worse"". ""We're at a point where COVID is now one of the major killers of Australians, and probably by the end of the year is going to be one of the top three,"" she told the ABC. ""And with increasing case numbers, new sub-variants [will be] coming in. This may drive it even further, which would have a bigger impact."" As Professor Baxter suggests, the emergence of new Omicron sub-variants in Australia is complicating matters. Experts suggest the variants may lead to people becoming reinfected, leading to another rise in cases, as is being seen in South Africa and parts of the US. Why are we seeing more of these new sub-variants? Is the virus mutating faster? And what are the implications for the future of COVID? Westmead Institute virologist Tony Cunningham, who has studied the evolution of viruses for more than four decades, said the continued emergence of alternate variants across the world was ""worrying"". ""The problem is we don't know enough about them yet,"" Professor Cunningham said. ""We don't know if one of these new variants will acquire the capacity to infect the lungs at the same degree that, say, Delta does. ""There's COVID all around. And where there's more virus in the community, there's more likelihood of variants emerging."" University of South Australia epidemiologist Adrian Esterman said cases ""will go up"" across Australia. ""And hospitalisation will continue to go up as cases go up,"" he said. ""And cases are going up, and they'll go up even further once the new sub-variants of Omicron take over, which they will do. Israeli health authorities have detected a case of what some are calling ""flurona"" — a double dose of COVID-19 and the flu. It comes as the country is experiencing a spike in influenza cases in recent weeks, sparking fears of a ""twindemic"". ""Our governments are giving out the messages that it's all over. It's not over, yet. ""We are at the end game. We have reasonably good vaccinations, good treatments and at least a reasonable chunk of the population that is immune. ""But it's not over."" One sector of the community acutely aware that COVID is ""not over"" is the country's healthcare workers. This week The Royal Australasian College of Physicians reiterated its call for urgent action over burnout and exhaustion in the sector, saying ""there is no respite"". Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid said healthcare workers felt there was ""a deliberate glossing over"" of the ongoing challenges that COVID-19 was putting on the healthcare system. ""We're a bit stuck,"" he said. We're treating COVID as if it's a cold, and saying no masks, play on. ""But there are still a lot of people coming into hospitals with COVID, and of course there's no staff,"" he said. He said healthcare workers were fed up, particularly around the messaging from politicians that the pandemic was ""over"". ""In Perth [where I'm based], they're saying it could be 20,000 to 25,000 cases a day soon,"" he said. ""And we have had a lot of anecdotal reports of people not testing themselves, or when they get a positive test not recording the result with the government. ""And, of course, that is impacting healthcare workers. For example, just in WA alone, we have about 2,500 healthcare workers off at the moment. ""We feel as if there's been no notice paid to the plight of our public hospitals. Our workers can't understand it.""

89,'You lose yourself in the euphoria': Athletes with a disability find their place in strength sports,health," Sport Athletes with a disability like Ainslee Hooper are finding their place in strength sports It's the noise that hits you first. The voices and cheers of the competitors and crowd bounce off the high concrete walls. The crash and clatter of metal on metal as weights are lifted and pushed. The high tempo music that pumps out of speakers perched high above the action. The combination should be jarring, a racket that grates. But, instead, the sound floats out of the open roller door and onto the quiet street like some kind of urban symphony. It's a Saturday morning at Strong Geelong and the Battle in the Bay Strongwoman and Strongman competition is underway. Inside the industrial building that is home to Strong Geelong, Ainslee Hooper, hands chalked and face set in fierce determination, waits for the call. ""Athlete ready?"" comes the shouted question. Ainslee nods. The clock starts and she clenches her hands around the 'log', the cylinder of steel meant to imitate an actual log. The goal is to get as many reps, or lifts, of the log in 60 seconds. To count as a rep, Ainslee must lift the log above her head. It's no easy task. But she has a secret weapon — the noisy crowd. Their words of encouragement and excitement pour out as Ainslee shifts the log from her chest. ""C'mon, Ainslee,"" they scream. ""You've got this!"" They want it nearly as much as Ainslee does. And when she makes the final push and hefts the log above her head, the crowd erupts. Ainslee, a wheelchair user, is one of dozens of competitors at Strong Geelong and while she's no stranger to strength training and competition, the Battle in the Bay marks an important development for her as an athlete and for strength sports in Australia more broadly. Because Battle in the Bay is the first time the sport's peak body, Australia's Strongest, has collaborated with All Abilities Strength to include an all abilities category in a strongwoman or strongman event. Strongwoman and strongman events are tests of strength, often more spectacle than sport. Athletes lift, carry, push or pull enormous weights in events like atlas stone (concrete stones that weigh anything from 17kg to 220kg), log press, yoke carry and deadlift. While today, the log press is not performed with actual logs and atlas stones are specially designed concrete spheres rather than large rocks, there remains something almost medieval about the sport, as if it has time travelled here from the past. For Ainslee, what the sport offers is the chance to test herself and her training but it also offers opportunities to compete in a broader range of events than a traditional powerlifting competition does. ""With powerlifting, all I can do is bench press,"" Ainslee said. ""I'm a wheelchair user so I can't do the squat or the deadlift. ""But with strongman, there's so much more that you can actually do."" Ainslee first competed in strongwoman at an event run by her trainer, Kerryn Taylor, earlier this year. ""I was the only disabled person competing at that comp… so we didn't really know how [it] was going to go, but it was really fun,"" she said. The 43-year-old, who works as a disability inclusion consultant, was encouraged by her partner, who is a powerlifter, and his coach to join them on the weights in 2016 after she experienced a nervous breakdown due to workplace bullying. ""I remember going to the gym, the first time I went in there, my partner trained me, and we worked out. And I just said to him, 'OK, I'm just going to go sit in the car until you're finished'. ""I felt really intimidated."" That feeling soon dissipated and was replaced by one of community and friendship and in 2018, after watching several powerlifting competitions, Ainslee went from spectator to competitor. ""That very first comp I bombed out because I was so nervous,"" Ainslee said. ""I didn't want to get in the way of running things slow or anything like that. But they were so nice and accommodating, even the guys who I used to find scary, like the big burly guys with the tattoos, they were coming up to me and going 'congratulations, well done'. ""And it's like, yeah, okay I've found my place now."" Nicole Brown is the woman behind the Battle in the Bay All Abilities competition. The owner of All Made New, a business dedicated to bringing people from all walks of life to strength training and sports, Nicole has been training and competing in strongman for several years. Her friendship with Ainslee was the catalyst for the development of All Abilities Strength, an All Made New program whose mission is not only to encourage people with disabilities to get involved in strength training and sports but also to ensure strongman and strongwoman events are inclusive. ""Seeing Ainslee train and training strongman was incredibly inspiring, but also listening to her speak about the difficulties as far as accessibility goes,"" Nicole said. ""The fact that there were people that were missing out on the benefits of strength training and training strongman is something that really drove me."" While the Battle in the Bay is not the first time disabled athletes have competed in a strongman or strongwoman competition, Nicole, who is also a nurse, says there hasn't been a coordinated effort to make the sport inclusive. ""There's been a bit of a gap in those competitions for people with a disability. ""There's been here and there competitions that would allow for persons with a disability to compete but today's kind of the first day really, that we've had a competition that is inclusive."" Through All Abilities Strength, Nicole is working with the sport's organising body, Australia's Strongest, and the manufacturer of the equipment, Stand or Submit, to deliver inclusive competitions. ""Traditionally in strongman, you get given a list of rules [for events] and that's what you do, no matter what, that's what you've got to do. We recognise at All Abilities Strength that kind of modus operandi doesn't necessarily work with persons with a disability. ""Our aim is to always adapt [the events] to suit persons with a disability rather than giving them all different events because we want it to be as inclusive as possible. ""Where that's not possible we may change the events."" Back at Strong Geelong, with the log press complete, the focus now shifts to the next event: the sled pull. A metal base with metal uprights forms the base of the sled. Weights are placed on the uprights and a heavy rope is attached to one end. It's this rope that the athletes will use to pull the weighted sled towards themselves. For Justine Martin, who began her involvement in strength sports with tug of war, the rope provides a sense of the familiar. While strongwoman events are new for Justine, she has been in and around strength sports like powerlifting and all-round weight lifting since the mid-2000s. The 51-year-old boasts an impressive collection of medals and a few world records as both an abled and disabled athlete. But Battle in the Bay is the first time she has competed in six years. ""This is a huge event for me to get back to lifting,"" she said. ""It's been such a passion for the last six years. When something's taken away from you without your choice, you want it back."" Justine was diagnosed with Remitting Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis in 2011. In 2016, only a year from the last of three heart surgeries, she was diagnosed with livedo reticularis, which led to later diagnoses of melanoma, mixed cryoglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Then, an MS relapse in 2017 put her in hospital and she spent weeks learning to walk again. ""[I] lost so much muscle mass… so, I really pushed to get back into the gym and all I could bench was a three-kilo bar. ""I couldn't leg press, I couldn't do anything. And I just kept going three days a week, and I got stronger."" As the sled pull is loaded with weights and the athletes test out their set up, Justine, who works as a public speaker, artist and author, glows with the thrill of competition. The high from the log press is evident in the smile on her face. ""When I stopped [the log press] I'm like, 'oh my god, I just did that'. I shocked myself on how many reps that I actually did. ""It's been an awesome day. [It's] so good to see everyone get behind everyone else. You kind of lose yourself in the euphoria of it all."" Competing alongside Ainslee and Justine is Justin Boencke, who has flown down from the Northern Territory. Justin has a neurological disability called Charcot-Marie-Tooth, which affects his peripheral nerves. ""The body stops sending the signals to them, so eventually, they just shut down and then die off, which then results in muscle wastage, and balance issues, hand grip issues and things like that. So, this sport is probably the opposite of what I should be doing."" For Justin, the Battle in the Bay All Abilities competition is an opportunity to hopefully encourage other people with a disability to give strength training and sports a go. ""Hopefully I can help other people with my disability go 'Well, why can't I do that?' and try the sport or get into just going to the gym or powerlifting. ""There's a lot of things that we can do, we don't have to sit there and go, that's not for me because I've got this disability. Just have a go. ""I also find that doing this stuff is a good mental break. It's good to help clear your head sometimes."" Many strongwoman and strongman events require specialist equipment. Mason Dannatt runs Stand or Submit, which makes equipment that can be used by people of all abilities. ""Before we were around, the lightest log that you could get was 70 or 80 kilos without any plates on it. So, all these people that were either beginning, or smaller framed, couldn't log press and all the stones were too big, everything was too heavy,"" Mason said. ""We made equipment that was still strong, but lighter in weight, to allow more people to get involved in the sport."" Mason, who also runs Australia's Strongest, the organising body for strongwoman and strongman events, says he would like to see all abilities events at all of the organisation's events but the focus right now is on how to grow the sport sustainably. ""It's always a balancing act with strongman in any of the categories to make sure that we have enough competitors to be able to make it valid to run at a show. ""My goal would be to see all abilities at our top shows at the start of each year and have a qualifying process to get there. The same as all the others."" The final event of the day is the stone to platform. Sitting at a bench with adjustable platforms, the goal is to shift the atlas stone from one platform to the other. One successful shift is one rep. They have 60 seconds to get as many reps as they can. At the bench, Justine grips the stone, her hot pink nails contrasting with the mottled grey concrete. Her hands are covered in Tacky, a product that helps the athletes hold onto the slippery concrete. ""Athlete ready?"" comes the call. Justine nods. She grips the atlas stone tighter and pulls it up and across the bench to the opposite platform. ""One!"" comes the call, acknowledging her first rep. As Justine builds momentum, shifting the stone back and forth, the encouragement from the crowd intensifies, willing her to shift the heavy concrete stone. Sixty seconds seems at once to take forever and be over too soon and time is called. Justine has managed 24 reps and the delight dances across her face. The physical benefits of strength training and sports are obvious, perhaps less obvious is the positive impact on metal wellbeing. Ainslee points to her improved confidence and resilience and says she believes strength training and sports like the Battle in the Bay Strongwoman event have helped her to manage her mental health. ""I've got an anxiety disorder, but once I've lifted those weights or have competed, it's almost like those weights' kind of like, push everything down back into place. Like everything's calm. It reduces the anxiety."" Nicole says there's a challenge around breaking down the stigma that can surround the sport and the accessibility challenges being faced. ""I truly do believe that strength sports and training does have the capacity to benefit you, not only physically, but psychologically, socially — the benefits are incredible. ""[But] some people can find [gyms] incredibly intimidating. ""You can imagine how it might feel for someone in a wheelchair or an amputee or someone with a cognitive disability wanting to go and train. ""They might feel like they don't belong, or that they're not welcome, but it's really not the case. ""We want to make sure that there's the capacity for them to go, when they want to go to the gym. ""My hope is that eventually, I won't have to approach competition organisers to say, 'you should be running an all-abilities category'. I want it to be mainstream and I want it to be universal. ""The ultimate goal with inclusion is that it's just that, that everyone is included."" Inside Strong Geelong, the post competition high radiates off the athletes. Thoughts of results and personal bests, the dissection of performance — that all comes later. Now, the moment is savoured, and relished. ""It's a very proud and historic moment to be a part of and to show other disabled athletes that you can still compete and you can still do things and that you are important and you are part of the community here,"" Justine said. ""I was shocked with how quick things were and how many reps I got out. So the next comp will be to push it even further and see how I can improve."" For Ainslee, the day was a mixed bag — on one hand the excitement of the all abilities competition and on the other, her disappointment with her own performance. ""I didn't perform on the day as well as I would have liked. But on reflection with my coach, there was a lot going on. It was only my second comp,"" Ainslee said. ""Now it's about making sure the next comp works better."" While things may not have gone to plan on the day, Ainslee credits her ability to bounce back from the disappointment to her coach Kerryn, and her focus on training a strong mind alongside a strong body. Ainslee believes there is plenty for All Abilities Strength to take from the competition. ""It's definitely a learning process for all of us… it's just going to mean better comps in the future."" It's this future that keeps Ainslee training and preparing for the next competition. ""I'm just hoping that every single gym in Australia takes it on board and provides opportunities to other disabled athletes.""

90,"When Sarah's world began shrinking, she bought a drone ",health,"  The sun beats down on Sarah Jenkins' right shoulder as her daughter lifts her into a sling chair next to the pool. Her hands curl and grip the poles as she is hoisted into the air and swung around. Her toes find the water first, then her ankles, then all but her green eyes submerge below the surface. Except for the green noodle she uses to support her arms, Sarah swims unaided. It is the one time she can move alone. ""The most important thing I can do is swim every day ... I think swimming basically saved my life,"" she says. Sarah moves from one side of the pool to the other, each footstep slow but deliberate. She grabs the side for extra support. As she walks, she gets what feel like ""zaps"" up her leg. ""It doesn't happen for the majority of the day,"" she says. ""[Swimming] just gives me the most amazing feeling and sensation, because you're stimulating the nerves."" It's that feeling of freedom that led Sarah to find her new passion — drone photography — at the height of lockdown. ""What's funny is that I can't take a photo with any other apparatus,"" she says. ""I can't use a standard camera and I can't use a mobile phone — I can't hold it up."" Sarah lives with a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy called LGMD2i (also called FKRP-related LGMD R9), one of the world's rare diseases. It started to present itself in her late teens as her performance decreased when swimming. ""I thought, oh, it's just puberty, I'm just slowing down."" When Sarah started her nursing career, people would ask her why she was limping as she walked down the corridor. ""I would say I'm not limping ... people noticed it before I did,"" she says. ""When I was 30, I went to an aerobics class, and we all had to get on our tippy toes, and I couldn't. So I went, okay, this is weird... and that's when I started doing testing."" Only a few hundred or thousand people in Australia are thought to have LGMD2i. ""It affects your respiratory muscles, so your diaphragm and intercostal muscles that help your lungs expand and contract are weakened,"" Sarah says. ""So my breathing is affected and usually that is what ends a person's life with muscular dystrophy. It is respiratory or cardiac failure — or both."" After she was diagnosed, Sarah fell pregnant with her first daughter Lucy and a year later, her second daughter Tess. It was during this period of her life that she started to feel a decline in her condition. ""I remember when I used to sit on the grass for picnics. And I thought, one day I'm not going to be able to get up."" That moment came in 2016, when her dog Pippa ran underneath her legs in her narrow hallway, and she broke her leg. ""From that day on, I never stood up again. I never walked. I never drove a car ... my whole life changed dramatically."" Drones came into Sarah's life at a time when her world was shrinking, as COVID lockdowns were closing in. During Melbourne's long lockdown, her daughter Lucy came to live with her in Port Douglas and, together, they decided they would buy one. ""We just said, what are we going to do? We've got to do something. I couldn't really do anything in the community, because I was high risk to COVID, I was pretty much having to isolate from people,"" Sarah says. She admits she was initially terrified she would crash it and didn't want to fly it herself. ""I gradually built confidence flying it, and I just saw the Earth from a different perspective."" In November 2020, Sarah organised a photo shoot inspired by COVID lockdowns and a recent artwork she had painted. ""I just got this idea of using a basketball court, just down the road, and I thought, what if I put this girl in the middle of the court, reading a magazine, supposedly having a really nice time, in the midst of this chaos that was going on in the world, making compromises to still be happy and enjoy life?"" She went and bought a pool ring and borrowed a little bag. ""It was 10 o'clock in the morning, and it was so hot,"" Sarah recalls of the shoot. ""The poor girl had to sit on a towel underneath the pool ring, and we just had to measure out. She was in the middle of the court, and I put the drone up, and I just started shooting."" The Boston Drone Film Festival found Sarah and Lucy's picture on their Instagram page, Air Bare Studio, and asked them to enter it in their competition. To their delight, their image won the architecture category in 2021, less than a year after they began experimenting with the drone. ""We felt a little like we didn't deserve the award as we were so inexperienced... but it gave us the confidence to enter another competition, which was Capture Magazine's Australasia's Top Emerging Photographers,"" Sarah says. The same image took home that award in the Single Shot category. An international publishing company has recently chosen 16 of Sarah and Lucy's images for their new book on minimalism in photography. Sarah says picking up a drone has helped reignite her creativity through a new lens. She loved painting during school and her early adult years and has had a deep appreciation for art and design ever since. ""Photography is no different to creating a painting — it's all about composition, orientation, framing, colour and tone, and it should tell a story,"" she says. ""I really do love to look at things in a minimalist way... to zero in on a particular section of an image for things that are quirky and unique. ""You've got to look at things from so many different perspectives to understand the real meaning of it."" Still, she laughs: ""We don't always hit the mark."" Even though Lucy is back living in Melbourne, Sarah has continued to experiment and looks forward to studying an online photography course this year. ""Photography has just made me realise that it is something I can absolutely do,"" she says. ""The drone can take me to places that I can't physically get to and create images I ordinarily wouldn't be able to.""

91,The little pink house that inadvertently toppled 50 years of abortion rights,health,"  Abortion in Mississippi is already limited to a single clinic. If Roe v Wade falls, it could soon be outlawed entirely The sun is still rising when Derenda Hancock arrives at the only remaining abortion clinic in Mississippi. Marked by a battered black-and-white sign on the state capital's main drag, the Jackson Women's Health Organization is better known as the ""Pink House"" for its distinctive bubblegum-coloured paint. For nine years, Ms Hancock has been organising the volunteers who escort patients from the car park to the front door. One of her team is already lining the fence with black tarps to block the view of the anti-abortion protesters who will soon arrive. Here's what we know about a leaked bombshell document about the US Supreme Court's plans for America's abortion law. Ms Hancock often calls them the ""antis"" but she greets the first two men by name. ""I know them better than I know my neighbours and half my family,"" she says. If Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling enshrining Americans' constitutional right to abortion, is overturned by the US Supreme Court, this uneasy morning ritual will end. The Pink House is at the centre of the case, which is expected to trigger Roe's downfall, after challenging a state law that restricts abortion to within 15 weeks. Under Roe v Wade, a pregnant American is allowed to access abortion care until 24 weeks, when a fetus is considered viable. A leaked draft ruling, published by Politico, shows the court is poised to back Mississippi authorities, clearing the way for even tighter restrictions and bans on abortion to roll out across the country. Ms Hancock estimates between 300 and 350 patients attend the clinic each month, with many travelling hundreds of kilometres from neighbouring states Louisiana and Alabama. Some come from as far as Texas and Tennessee. ""We've dealt with the fact that there's not abortion access in the state,"" she says. ""When you've got one clinic for three million people, it's really a reach to call that access. ""And so, we've always said, 'as Mississippi goes, so goes the nation'. And now here it is."" By the time counselling appointments start at 7.30am, at least a dozen protesters, including children dressed in matching ""abortion is murder"" T-shirts, have set up on the footpath. To enter the Pink House, patients must drive the length of the building to the gate, often with protesters clamouring around their cars. Some are more subdued, however, silently praying at a distance. ""For every woman, it's different,"" Ms Hancock says. ""We have a few that are really bold and hold their head up high and basically flip the antis off on their way in the door. But… Mississippi is the most Christian state in the nation. ""Half these people are afraid that their grandma goes to church with one of the protesters on the sidewalk."" Ms Hancock and her fellow volunteers, who call themselves the Pink House Defenders, band together in rainbow-striped vests but are regularly outnumbered. ""Somebody has to do it,"" Ms Hancock says. ""I feel like women have the right to make their own medical decisions without all this harassment."" Coleman Boyd, a vocal anti-abortion street preacher, sets up a PA to blast his message through the fence. At around 9am, a woman dressed in business attire, armed with a whistle, storms up to spray him with a foul-smelling liquid. ""If you are going to make it uncomfortable for them to be here, then I will make it uncomfortable for you,"" she says. Mr Boyd says he welcomes the Supreme Court draft but wants it to go further. ""That doesn't take away the task or the responsibility of the church and, ultimately, the governing authorities to establish justice,"" he says. ""And that is to call murder 'murder', to treat it like murder, to penalise it like murder."" He is against exemptions from abortion bans for pregnant survivors of rape and incest, as well as destroying embryos created for IVF. In some states, his vision is already playing out. Louisiana recently floated, then scrapped, a plan to classify abortion as homicide in order to prosecute women for ending pregnancies. In 2021, Texas passed a law skirting Roe by allowing residents to collect $10,000 rewards for suing women for having abortions beyond six weeks. If, as expected, the Supreme Court acts to undermine nearly 50 years of precedent, some 26 states are likely to ban abortion using pre-Roe laws and ""trigger"" laws, which will kick in shortly after the judgement lands. The ruling could be softened or reversed but many experts believe the end of Roe is nigh. Vara Lyons, a senior counsel for ACLU Mississippi, says she was gutted when she read the draft opinion penned by conservative justice Samuel Alito. ""I'm a woman within the age to have kids and I've made the choice to focus on my career,"" she says. ""I have friends who have decided to have children — who decided to have children and careers, or who decided to be stay-at-home mothers — and I believe we should have that decision."" This is not the first time Mississippi has tried to restrict abortion access, she says. In 2013, the Republican state legislature used a Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers law, or TRAP law, to force most of the state's abortion providers to stop operating via onerous rules and licensing requirements. The Pink House was the only clinic in the state to survive the red-tape assault. It also fought off the 15-week abortion ban in federal court in 2018, arguing successfully the law violated the protections established by Roe and affirmed by the Supreme Court in the 1990s. Mississippi appealed that decision, however, and Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization made its way to the top of the US court system. ""The problem with this case is the Supreme Court didn't have to take it,"" Ms Lyons says. ""The 15-week ban is outside of the viability framework, and it's unconstitutional. Leave it at that."" Omarr Peters, the regional coordinator of anti-abortion organisation Students for Life, hopes the end of Roe will herald a return to an earlier era. He identifies as a former pro-choice Democrat who changed his view during university after learning a close family member was pressured to have an abortion she didn't want. ""You can listen to statistics, you can listen to other people's stories — and that can impact you, don't get me wrong,"" he says. ""But when you hear about it from your own family, it tends to change your perspective a whole lot."" He agrees with Justice Alito's conservative reading of the US constitution, saying the implied right to privacy, which Roe hinges upon, is an illusion. Legal scholars who have studied the leaked document say it could have huge implications for America's future, write Carrington Clarke and Joanna Robin. ""I believe that one day we can and will abolish abortion in our lifetime,"" he says. ""We believe we're on the right side of history."" Mr Peters's organisation has no formal position on the use of contraceptives but he supports ""natural family planning"", an unreliable method of avoiding pregnancy by tracking women's menstrual cycles. It offers no protection from sexually transmitted diseases. He thinks women should not be punished for seeking abortions but wants other options, such as adoption, to be pursued instead. Delia Wilder, a public health master's student at Jackson State University, is concerned young women are being left out of the conversation. ""You should have the option to do what you want to do,"" she says. ""It shouldn't be anyone else's choice."" Ms Wilder fears losing access to birth control and wants Mississippi to improve sex education for young people, focusing on safe sex and respectful relationships. From either side of the ideological spectrum, the pair say voting is key to shaping Mississippi for the next generation. ""If you don't like something, you can change it,"" Mr Peters says. ""You have the free speech to change it."" For Ms Wilder, it's not so simple: ""This is a democracy. And we live in it. And we're supposed to be able to have our input on it. ""We're the land of the free but nothing's free here."" The Jackson Women's Health Organization is still operating but its future is uncertain beyond late June, when the Supreme Court is expected to publish its final decision. For almost 50 years, Dr Warren Hern has performed abortions in Colorado, a liberal safe haven for the women of Texas and other conservative states. ""It's devastating, not surprising, but devastating,"" says Cheryl Hamlin, one of six abortion providers who works at the clinic. ""I spend all my time thinking like, 'well, what are we going to do?'"" The clinic is in the process of opening a second outpost in New Mexico, which has been dubbed ""Pink House West"", according to NBC News. ""We don't obviously want to forget about the women of Mississippi,"" says Dr Hamlin, who lives in Massachusetts. Mississippi has the highest poverty rate in United States, according to census data, and interstate travel is out of reach for many women, particularly with the added costs of accommodation, childcare and time off work. Even those with the means to travel interstate for abortions face risks returning home. ""Complications happen. Pills don't always work,"" Dr Hamlin says.""And what are they going to do? Are they going to go to the emergency room? Probably not. Or seek care from their doctor? Probably not. ""Women will die. There's no way around that."" Mississippi already has a high maternal mortality rate and Ms Hancock cautions banning abortion will lead to a spike in deaths. ""[Women] are going to resort to any measures necessary if they don't want to have children,"" she says. ""And they'll drink bleach, that already happens here in Mississippi, they will throw themselves down a flight of stairs. ""Abortion is not going away. It's just going to be unsafe, and possibly deadly.""

92,"'Complacency has a price': AMA warns re-infection rates to rise, as SA COVID deaths surpass 400",health,"  South Australia has recorded five more COVID-related deaths, taking the total number of lives lost in the state since the start of the pandemic to 401. SA Health reported 3,816 new cases of COVID-19 today, bringing the total number of active cases to 25,672. The deaths were a man aged in his 50s, a man aged in his 70s, two men in their 80s and a woman aged in her 80s. There are 217 people in hospital with COVID-19, including 11 people in intensive care. Of those hospitalisations, SA Health said 107 patients had received three or more vaccine doses and 110 patients are either unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or have an unknown vaccination status. Australian Medical Association vice-president Chris Moy told ABC Radio Adelaide today the level of complacency in the community ""has a price"". ""Across Australia we are getting about 40,000 cases a day, and there are 350,000 people with COVID at any moment... and 3,000 people in hospital,"" he said. ""We are up there with the very largest case numbers in the world, partly because we didn't have so many cases earlier but the complacency, the freedom has a price."" Dr Moy said vaccinations are bolstering peoples' immunities against new Omicron sub variants, including the BA4 and BA5 strains. But he said there had been increased reporting of people becoming infected with COVID-19 for a second time and that people should not rely on previous infection for immunity. ""For people who are unvaccinated but have had Omicron before, they are getting re-infected and that's the big issue at the moment,"" he said. ""We really need people vaccinated and not just relying on the fact that they may have had COVID previously, because obviously if you look at that logically the concern is there could be surge from BA4 and BA5 at some stage.""

93,"Club celebrates 100 years of 'the thought sport', a nasty game for nice people",health,"  Nowra Croquet Club celebrates 100 years of playing 'the thought sport', a nasty game for nice people Those who play croquet say it is 15 per cent skill and 85 per cent psychology, an aggressive game played by nice people with a smile on their face. The nice people of Nowra Croquet Club celebrate a century of play this year, and today launch a book acknowledging and celebrating 100 years since the club's inception. Secretary of Nowra Croquet Club, Karen James, instigated the production of the book. It proudly highlights a unique feature of the club — being largely women-only for a majority of its history. But it is not a ladies club anymore. ""Our first male, as is shown in the book, did not become a member until 1982, so that's a long time of it being [only for] ladies, and of course they played in long skirts."" ""Ladies played to the side with their mallet because it was unseemly for a woman to push a mallet between her legs."" Patience, persistence, and a playful spirit is required for this hard-hitting game. ""It's called 'the thought sport' and that's particularly important for us older people,"" said 82-year-old player David Knott. The Nowra Croquet Club and members play a big role Mr Knott's life, who joined the club five years ago and plays frequently. ""It's a very strategic game and there is a lot of thought in it,"" Mr Knott said. ""You're looking to outsmart your opponent. You're looking for the position of their balls versus the position of your own balls. You have to assess what stroke you are going to make for the benefit of scoring that hoop. ""The art is moving the opponents' balls as far away as possible."" ""You have to think and you're exercising all the time. That's the important thing — you keep moving."" Pam Harrison started playing croquet when she was 89. She is now 91 and not only does she love it, according to club members she is also quite good. ""You can still play croquet with a walker, you just have to leave it there for a moment while you grab your mallet and hit the ball, then come back to your walker,"" Ms Harrison said. ""I love it. Anybody who has got a walker and thinks they should come, just come, because you'll be made very welcome."" Doug Cornish, vice-captain and grounds coordinator at the club, agrees the game employs something akin to war tactics. ""A lot of players will say it's an aggressive game played by nice people with a smile on their face,"" he said. Out on the lawn you have four options. ""It's all about deciding whether you can run a hoop, or whether you need to clear an opponent or block an opponent, or promote your partner ball,"" he said. However, Mr Cornish said a key ingredient to a good game was patience. ""Don't rush in. Look at what your options are, and then if you want to get really technical you'd look at what the percentage of performing a particular shot is,"" he said. Karen James believes that at their club, which supports over 60 members, players understand the importance of sport. ""People are realising, for longevity, the importance of sport,"" she said. ""[It is important] to keep going and to keep not only physically active but socially active, so you are interacting as well. ""This game is perfect for those people who can't run the marathon any more or swing a golf club or even bend down to bowl.""

94,'The sunset was incredible': Flood-trapped mum gets helicopter ride after giving birth at surf instructor's house,health,"  Queensland flood-trapped mum and newborn doing fine after Agnes Water birth, helicopter rescue When Priscilla Uhr started having contractions on Friday at her home near Agnes Water, she did not realise exactly where the day would take her. She had planned to travel to Bundaberg with her partner for the birth of her second daughter, but the town had been completely cut off from the outside world due to rising floodwaters flowing over the roads leading into town. ""The roads were all closed so we drove to the ambulance station just to see if there was an ambulance there,"" Ms Uhr said. ""We got there and the [paramedics] suggested we just stay at the station and birth there. ""But we weren't too comfortable with that, so we were thinking we'd head back home, but the roads were blocked."" Instead, the couple, along with paramedics, ended up at Ms Uhr's surf instructor's home. ""I birthed at her home, in her bedroom,"" she said. ""The ambulance service helped. ""I was lucky, it was a nice, quick birth. ""I couldn't have planned a better home birth if I wanted to."" While Ms Uhr's young daughter, who is yet to be named, entered the world, paramedics had called the Capricorn Rescue helicopter service for backup. ""At the time when it first started, it was too windy and rainy, [and paramedics] didn't think they would get in,"" she said. ""But then it cleared up and the helicopter came from Rockhampton and landed at the recreational centre."" The helicopter landed on the sports oval at the centre, where the crew retrieved Ms Uhr and the newborn baby and took them to Gladstone Hospital. ""The helicopter ride was a bonus,"" Ms Uhr said. ""The sunset was incredible, and it was a really beautiful experience to end everything with."" She said both her and the baby were doing well, albeit a little tired. ""I kind of lean a bit to the auspicious side of things, so I embraced [everything],"" she said. ""I surrendered to the elements and that kind of helped me, to give my full trust to myself as a woman and the ability to go through with it."" Ms Uhr said her young daughter would now always have an incredible birth story to tell. ""It was an adventure to say the least,"" she said. ""Everyone was really helpful, the whole community was incredible, the [emergency] services were really helpful."" Both Tableland Road and Fingerboard Road, the two roads that connect Agnes Water to Bundaberg and the Bruce Highway, remain closed. Matthew Lynch, the acting officer in charge of the Agnes Water Ambulance Station, said delivering Ms Uhr's baby was a big team effort. ""We were able to get in touch with a community nurse who was able to come out and help us with the delivery as well,"" he said. A midwife based in Brisbane was also video-called to help with the delivery. ""That technology definitely assisted,"" Mr Lynch said. ""Just being able to talk to a fully qualified midwife, she was fantastic reminding us of the finer details of delivery."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. He said this was the first time he had to deliver a baby while the community he was in was cut off from the outside world. ""It was really nice to be a part of that community where everyone worked as a good team together to safely deliver a baby,"" he said. ""We were pretty tired at the end of the day. ""From start to finish the event took nearly eight hours … and in that time [my colleague] also responded to two or three other calls in the community. He was busy."" He said local police also played a part in helping establish a landing zone for the Capricorn Rescue helicopter.

95,New play dives into issues of grief and depression — but with light on the surface,health,"  New State Theatre Company play Cathedral dives into issues of grief and depression Ten-year-old Caleb Lewis sat with his sister on a jetty watching his dad sink below the water, unsure if he would ever come back. It was the mid-1990s on a family trip from Melbourne to Adelaide which had come to a temporary halt near Mount Gambier. ""Dad told us all about this place called Piccaninnie Ponds, where quite a few fatalities have occurred,"" Lewis vividly recalled. ""It's an exquisite ecosystem, but one that if you are inexperienced it can very quickly become dangerous. ""Dad told us about that as kids, then put his diving tanks on and we just sat on the jetty waiting for him to come back — just waiting — going: 'What happens if he doesn't come back? What happens if the bubbles stop?'"" Fast forward several decades and Lewis, now 44 and a writer, has continued that tradition after unveiling his latest play, Cathedral. It was a work State Theatre Company South Australia commissioned; originally to be about tuna fishermen and Port Lincoln, before a rethink saw it being based on the south-eastern city of Mount Gambier. The production tells the story of a diver who is suffering from nitrogen narcosis (a change in consciousness and neuromuscular function) while at the bottom of a flooded sinkhole, how he ended up down there and how he will get out, if at all. As he worked on the production, Lewis got in contact with Mount Gambier diver Josh Richards, before spending time with him on the Limestone Coast. Richards had his own story to tell which became part of Cathedral. ""There's a point in the play where someone escapes and there's a physical injury that's sustained during that escape,"" he said. ""That's drawn from a story I was involved in where I injured myself quite badly trying to squeeze out of a cave. ""Coming back out, I left one piece of equipment on, which was the one piece of equipment that stuck. ""I was halfway through this tight little hole and I couldn't go any further up or down and I wound up stuck there for six or seven minutes, which was pretty unpleasant,"" he remembered. It was these stories that added to Lewis's many experiences with the water. They included his dad being a diver who helped fish bodies out of the Yarra River, after people jumped off the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne. The now Queensland-based Lewis studied acting and playwriting at Flinders University. When he was 22, he visited his father who was working on an oil rig near Dubai. Lewis temporarily became a firefighting instructor, which included time undertaking training for search and rescue operations, and underwater helicopter escapes. That long history with water and survival stretched back to Lewis's grandfather, who was a bomber in World War II in Europe. His plane crashed into the Danube River and he was one of two crew who managed to swim out of the rapidly sinking plane, joining the ""goldfish club"" for airmen who survived crashes. It seemed fitting that water became that central theme when the State Theatre Company enlisted him to write Cathedral. But writing it became deeply personal at a time in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its worst and personal tragedies had hit Lewis. ""We suffered several deaths in my own family, in particular as a young boy, and I think part of the play was processing the grief — it's about a guy who wakes up in a dark hole and had to find his way out of it,"" he said. ""It's absolutely [got] autobiographical elements — I've suffered depression for years and I remember this incredible sense of release and relief when I was formerly diagnosed."" A critical factor in Lewis staying healthy is going on long-distance walks. ""That's made a profound difference, actually, and something I stumbled on,"" he said. ""There's a loosening up of the body and mind that came from ambling, of going for those long distance walks and you surrender yourself to the moment — you let go of all the anxiety."" Those walks included hiking Germany's Black Forest, fittingly where the Brothers Grimm gathered inspiration for their folktales. ""That was cool, that was a really terrific time,"" Lewis said. ""I brought a copy of the Brothers Grimm and I'd just pull up under a tree and read a couple of fairytales and wonder what might come walking down the path. ""I sprinkled plenty of breadcrumbs behind me so I didn't get lost on my way back,"" he laughed. That ongoing battle with depression has changed his hardline stance on avoiding ""escapist theatre"", allowing his dark-themed plays to end with some optimism. ""There's got to be hope — you have to be able to lead them out into the dawn — I think 20-year-old Caleb would have written Cathedral with a dark ending,"" he explained. ""I'm interested in helping people to see the world in a different way and perhaps to grow a little and heal a little."" Cathedral is playing at Adelaide's Space Theatre until May 21, with a tour of regional South Australia to follow.

97,Labor promises almost $1 billion for Medicare and GPs if it wins federal election,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Federal Labor is entering the election campaign home stretch armed with a promise of almost $1 billion in new Medicare and primary-health funding if it wins next weekend's federal poll, as both leaders prepare for a frenetic final week of campaigning. The AMA says Labor's plan would ""put general practice on a pathway to a more sustainable future"" Both leaders are preparing for a frenetic final week of campaigning ahead of Saturday’s poll The Coalition is promising $20 million for 700,000 high school students to play more sport The pledge consists of $750 million over three years for a new ""Strengthening Medicare"" fund which aims to improve patient access to GPs including after hours, decrease pressure on hospitals and better manage complex and chronic conditions. It also includes $220 million for grants of up to $50,000 for GPs to train staff, upgrade IT telehealth systems, buy equipment and improve ventilation and infection control. If Anthony Albanese wins on May 21, Labor will also create a Medicare task force that will be chaired by the health minister and include peak body groups such as the Australian Medical Association, Royal Australian College of GPs and the National Aboriginal Controlled Community Health Organisation. ""Every day, everywhere I go, people talk to me about how it's getting more and more difficult to see a doctor,"" Mr Albanese said. ""Australians trust their GPs. It's a vital relationship in ensuring all Australians get the quality healthcare they deserve."" The plan was immediately welcomed by Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Omar Khorshid who said it ""put general practice on a pathway to a more sustainable future"". While most have their calendars marked for May 21, many keen voters want to know how to beat the queue and what the options are if they can't make it to a polling station. In 2019 Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a 10-year Primary Healthcare Fund, but the AMA has accused the Coalition of stalling on the promise. ""The primary care fund announced today by the ALP, if implemented, is a strong down payment that will help realise the recently completed 10-year primary health care plan — a plan which has remained completely unfunded by the government,"" Dr Khorshid said. ""The ALP's primary care fund pledge will allow investment in programs that will improve access to services for patients including GP after-hours services and the Workforce Incentive Program. We welcome the ALP commitment to work with the AMA on the implementation of primary-care reform."" Dr Khorshid's comments stand in stark contrast to those made last month, when the AMA criticised Labor's promise to fund 50 bulk-billed urgent care medical centres, saying it was a ""small-target"" pledge which would do nothing to alleviate pressure on emergency departments. On Saturday, Health Minister Greg Hunt argued the pledge lacked detail. ""This morning we've seen another day, another train wreck from Mr Albanese,"" Mr Hunt said. ""It's ever more clear that he's just not up to it. ""Today we've seen a billion-dollar slush fund from the leader of the opposition for undisclosed recipients, through undisclosed recipients, through undisclosed ministerial processes, through undisclosed parties for undisclosed purposes."" Labor's health pitch comes ahead of the Liberal party's official campaign launch on Sunday. The Coalition is promising to spend $20 million expanding a high school sports program to an additional 700,000 high school students if it is elected. The Sporting Schools program offers year 7 and 8 students access to partnerships with 35 national sporting organisations, including the AFL and the Netball Australia. Mr Morrison said if he was returned to government, the program would be expanded to include year 9 and 10 students. That would broaden its reach to 2.9 million pupils. ""Getting more young people involved in sport helps keep our kids active, builds confidence and it provides a way for families to connect back to community sporting clubs as we bounce back from the pandemic,"" Mr Morrison said. ""It also creates opportunities and connections to support those students who want to make their sporting dreams a reality."" The government is also promising to provide $4.8 million worth of grants to help surf lifesaving clubs across Australia buy vital life-saving equipment such as rescue boards and defibrillators.

98,"The simple program which resulted in improved nutrition, fewer hospital trips and visits to doctors for older Australians",health,"  In-house dental program Senior Smiles improving overall health, quality of life in aged care homes In a small aged care facility on the New South Wales Central Coast, more and more residents are finding a reason to smile. That's because for more than a decade, a highly successful program has helped them improve their dental health. Senior Smiles was created by Doctor Janet Wallace from the University of Newcastle after years of researching the importance of dental care in aged care facilities. She's now a professor of oral health at the University of Sydney. ""Senior Smiles is unique in the fact that it puts an oral health practitioner in the facility so that the practitioner can build a relationship with the staff and residents and dentists in the private and public sector,"" she said. A lack of dental care for elderly residents can cause extreme pain, difficulties swallowing and speaking, disrupted sleep, depression and even early death. A recent report found a quarter of Australians over 75 have teeth affected by decay, while 20 per cent have complete tooth loss. Professor Wallace said that dental care in Australia's aged care system was, at best, ad-hoc. ""Currently residents in aged care facilities are treated for oral health conditions when it becomes an emergency and that's really not good enough,"" she added. The Senior Smiles program was established with a grant across five residential aged care facilities on the NSW central coast. It provides an oral health practitioner who works on-site, regular dental checks, the creation of individual dental care plans, and referral pathways to dentists. Senior Smiles team member Kay Franks said oral health had long been neglected in aged care. ""Staff are very busy and oral health tends to get put on the back burner, but now having an oral health practitioner… [the residents] can get used to someone that negotiates with them and they start to trust them,"" Professor Franks said. The in-house oral health practitioner also trains existing staff to implement parts of the care plan. It can be as simple as teaching residents to clean dentures with soap and water instead of toothpaste. Professor Wallace said an independent economic analysis of the program found that for every dollar spent on preventive oral health care in residential aged care, $2.40 in benefits was delivered to the healthcare system and an additional $3.18 in social benefits. Those benefits included improved nutrition, a lower risk of pneumonia, fewer hospital admissions and visits to doctors, decreased prescription costs and fewer deaths. Some participating facilities are now planning on expanding to include a dental surgery on site. The program is endorsed by all of Australia's dental health professional associations. Dr Kathleen Matthews, from the Australian Dental Association, gave evidence to the Aged Care Royal Commission about the need for programs like Senior Smiles. It was really important to remember, she said, that aged care facilities already had other specialists, such as podiatrists, come in to provide care. ""I also think that most of the residential aged care facilities that I've gone into have a hairdressing salon, which is wonderful because I love having my hair done,"" she said. ""But I think it's not right when only certain parts of the body get access and this is such a fundamental part of your overall health, having a healthy mouth."" Michael Powell is one of many Australians facing years on a waitlist for public dental care. His experience, like so many others, is partly behind growing pressure on the major political parties to commit more money to dental care. Dr Matthews said it was well known that oral health affects general health. ""If someone has a poorly functioning mouth that [is] full of active decay, we know that a load of bacteria can be inhaled into the lungs and it contributes significantly to aspiration pneumonia,"" she said. ""So when you look at cause-of-death you will often see aspiration pneumonia. I think there's a strong link between poor oral health and having aspiration pneumonia."" The royal commission ultimately recommended every resident entering a facility should have an oral health assessment, regular dental care and referrals for any treatment. ""The majority of people within an aged care setting don't get a dental assessment as part of their in-boarding… and then they have a number of huge barriers to overcome to go and get dental care,"" Dr Matthews said. ""The hard thing is when you see someone who can't communicate well, their cognitive decline means their ability to communicate has been impacted and so potentially they're grumpy, out of sorts and an unhappy person and sometimes the reason for that is a toothache.""

99,A vote for an alternative voice in the bush is likely to be a vote against COVID-19 mandates,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes People living in regional Western Australia have the luxury of choosing from a wide variety of candidates at next weekend's federal election. But country voters feeling disenchanted with the major parties would be hard pressed to find an alternative voice that is not an anti-COVID-19 mandate campaigner. Aside from the Greens and the Western Australia Party (WAP), all the minor parties running lower house candidates in Forrest, O'Connor and Durack have policies spruiking ""medical freedom"" or slamming the government decisions to make vaccines compulsory for many workers. Some candidates in the mix lost their jobs because of the vaccine mandates and several hold strong anti-vaccination views. WA's vaccine mandate, which encompasses about 75 per cent of the workforce, is one of the strictest in the nation. Curtin University's extremist research network co-director Ben Rich said it was a concerning time in Australian politics. ""It's telling that neither of the major parties have put this on their platform,"" he said. ""[The anti-mandate parties] have very astutely observed in a notable amount of individuals in the population that there is this grievance out there and have been willing to capitalise on it and in some cases inflame it for their own political agendas."" Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Despite the over-representation of anti-mandate candidates, more than 95 per cent of the state's population received two jabs against COVID-19. ""I have known many people who have been supportive of the mandates, or who have been supportive of the major parties but not the mandates, and they are really kind of scratching their heads at this point,"" he said. ""I think this is going to be a tough election."" The ABC spoke to several early voters outside a polling station in the regional port city Bunbury, in WA's south-west corner, most whom intended to vote for a major party. Those who did plan to vote for an independent said it was an issue of dissatisfaction with the major parties rather than because of COVID mandates. Gloria Speakman said she would vote for one of the two majors, but felt the independents had a big role to play and that no single issue was behind her vote. ""Nothing specific,"" she said. ""Just overall I'm not happy with the way things are going."" Marco Hobbs said he would vote for an independent because he felt the quality of the candidates for the major parties was so low. He said his vote had nothing to do with vaccine mandates. ""It's pretty sad, when you see the candidates, that it's the best Australia's got to offer,"" he said. ""I just think it's just good not to run with the mainstream and to give other people a chance, given how low the quality of the main parties is."" Scott McLennan voted for an independent and had been supporting and handing out how-to-vote cards for some parties opposed to mandates. ""Major parties need to be held accountable,"" he said. ""They're just ramming things through. ""Mandates affected me — I had the jab that I didn't want to have. ""It affected me a lot."" The Great Australia Party's (GAP) Tracy Aitken told voters on the campaign trail she was refusing to mandate the vaccine for workers at her Bunbury construction business. Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party candidate Shane Mezgner is a practising chiropractor who refused to disclose his vaccination status to the ABC. Australian Federation Party (AFP) candidates Craig Shore and Isaac Middle were among those who lost their jobs after refusing to get vaccinated. Mr Middle said that experience was his ""main motivation"" for his decision to enter politics. ""I lost both of those jobs and that sort of changed my outlook on life in many ways, and energised me to see if I could make a difference,"" he said. While acknowledging he was in the ""minority"" of people who had chosen not to get the vaccine, he predicted the results of the election would reflect how many people were opposed to the mandates. Mr Middle also confirmed there were formal and informal agreements in place between the minor parties, including a preference deal between the AFP, the Informed Medical Options Party and GAP. ""There's also another alliance called the 'freedom alliance' which are political parties and organisations that are committed to helping and stand together on this issue,"" he said. 'Freedom' campaigners in regional WA include candidates from Clive Palmer's United Australia Party (UAP), the Australian Christians and the Liberal Democrat Party. A total of 26 candidates across all WA seats have joined an official cohort of anti-mandate campaigners called 'Reignite Democracy Australia'. There are some voices in the major parties critical of vaccine mandates, including the Liberal MP for O'Connor, Rick Wilson. ""Do truck drivers need to be mandated? I actually don't think so,"" he said. ""I believe that in Western Australia the mandates went too far and it's caused an enormous amount of grief and an enormous amount of heartache for many good people who basically want to decide what … they put into their bodies."" Australian Medical Association WA head Mark Duncan-Smith urged people to understand who they were voting for before heading into the ballot box. ""I find that the anti-mandate agenda is pretty much a rationalisation for the anti-vax agenda and I really don't see a lot of difference between the two,"" he said. ""Anyone looking to vote for a minor party as a protest vote against Liberal or Labor has to look at what they actually stand for and make sure it makes sense to them. ""Don't just vote for them because they're alternative as a protest."" University of Western Australia vaccination policy expert Katie Attwell said while some of the messages from the minor parties were ""not great"" from a public health perspective, she said most people had already made up their mind about getting the jab. ""In terms of recruiting people to their cause or persuading people, I think that ship has largely sailed,"" she said.

100,What every parent needs to know before their child is admitted to hospital,health,"  What every parent needs to know before their child is admitted to hospital It's a parent's nightmare — the unexplained death of a child in an environment where they should have the best possible care: a hospital. It's exactly what happened to the family of young girl Amrita Lanka, who died in Melbourne last month. The eight-year-old was brought to Monash Children's Hospital with stomach pains on April 29, where her parents were told Amrita's complaints of breathing difficulty were caused by an empty stomach. By the time doctors had realised how sick Amrita was, several hours later, it was too late. The Australian Patients Association (APA) says it receives countless reports of similar situations from across the country. It's calling for a national framework to provide independent reviews of such cases and says ""stretched and struggling"" public hospitals need more funding. ""There's no doubt that what happened at Monash Hospital could happen to any family,"" APA chief executive Stephen Mason said. If you're worried about the treatment someone in hospital is receiving, how you escalate your concerns depends on where you live. In November, State Coroner Derek Lee found the death of a three-year-old girl at Sydney's Westmead children's hospital came after a string of ""missed opportunities"" to save her life. Caitlin Cruz died from influenza B in October 2016 after being rushed to the hospital having collapsed and suffered a seizure at her local GP. Despite this, reports of those critical symptoms were lost along the road from the clinic to Westmead when paramedics miscategorised clear signs of serious illness as ""lethargy"". Caitlin had in fact developed fluid on her heart but didn't receive an ECG for four hours because the machine was out of battery. Last year, her grieving mother stood outside the Lidcombe Coroner's Court to say Caitlin would still be alive if someone had ""just cared enough that day"". The REACH program — Recognise, Engage, Act, Call, Help — was introduced across NSW hospitals in 2014 to assist patients and family to escalate their care status. It provides a step-by-step guide to requesting clinical reviews of care which includes the ability to call a dedicated number to trigger an independent review or ""rapid response"" if concerns aren't resolved. NSW Health's Acting Chief Executive Dr James Mackie said it was families who often noticed changes to their loved one's condition. ""REACH is about having a safety net for patients, families and carers,"" he said. ""REACH is widely available across NSW hospitals to patients in a variety of settings including emergency departments, mental health, adult and paediatric wards,"" he said. However, Mr Mason said despite NSW being the most-populous state in the country, its system to escalate urgent situations was far from the benchmark. Mr Mason said Queensland's escalation process was the ""gold standard"" in Australia, with Western Australia coming in second. Both states have robust escalation policies — Ryan's Rule and Aishwarya's CARE Call respectively — which were introduced after the tragic deaths of children. The rules allow patients, parents and family members to call for reviews if they feel their concerns aren't being listened to. In Victoria, there is no blanket system for all hospitals. While an escalation pilot program was launched in 2019 by Safer Care Victoria called HEAR Me, patient escalation is still determined by individual hospital policy. Tasmania has a three-step patient safety protocol— the Call and Respond Early (CARE Call) protocol— in place for patients, family members and carers to raise concerns, including a dedicated phone number as a ""final point of escalation"". The ACT has the Call and Respond Early (CARE) for Patient Safety Program where a patient themselves, family member or carer can go through a three step process with the final option being a phone call to a dedicated line for a senior nurse to assess their condition and assist as required. In South Australia their Escalation of Care policy states a treating doctor must arrange for the patient to speak directly with a senior clinician if they are experiencing ongoing concerns about their condition or standard of care. For the Top End, East Arnhem and the Big Rivers region, a system called REACT is in place encouraging concerned individuals to raise issues with a staff member or an Aboriginal Liaison Officer and only call a hotline (1800 290 888) if there is no change. A ""similar"" system is in place in the Central Australia and Barkly regions. Mr Mason said parents across the country have told the APA of their frustrations that ""no one seems to take them seriously"". ""Fortunately, there are not many deaths but no parent should be put in a situation where they don't know if their child is going to live or die, and no one seems to give a damn,"" he said. Mr Mason says the pressure hospital staff have been under during the COVID-19 pandemic might have exacerbated existing shortfalls in the health system. Nurses are overworked and specialists are quitting their jobs, but Mr Mason said that wasn't an excuse for serious illnesses being missed. The situation can be even worse in regional and rural areas of the nation, where staffing levels, resources, equipment and experience often pales in comparison to metro hospitals. ""It's not broken, but it's struggling a bit [the nation's health system],"" he said. ""There's no doubt the hospital system needs more funding."" Mr Mason said introducing a national standard for escalation procedures was crucial to ensuring patients' safety, as was taking the reviews of failures such as the one that claimed Amrita's life out of the hands of the hospitals themselves. ""All these investigations have to be independent.""

101,Victoria records 22 new COVID-19 deaths and experts ponder uptick in cases,health,"  As Victorians emerged from two years largely defined by lockdowns, the start of 2022 was marked by the sharp rise and fall of cases as a wave of Omicron swept through. That wave, which peaked in early January with tens of thousands of cases per day, subsided somewhat, but epidemiologists warned there would be more to come, particularly as the winter months approached. This week, the number of new daily cases in Victoria rose above 10,000 for multiple consecutive days and reached numbers not seen since early February, with 14,333 new infections reported on Thursday. Victoria recorded 22 deaths from the virus on Saturday, and 12,160 new cases. There are now 524 people in hospital with the virus, of whom 24 are in intensive care, and four are on a ventilator. Experts are still watching the data carefully as it emerges, but a definite ""resurgence"" in cases has been noted. University of Melbourne epidemiologist Nancy Baxter said it appeared multiple factors converging had resulted in the uptick of cases. She said the relaxing of restrictions, including no longer requiring household contacts to stay at home was playing a role in higher transmission, but no one factor was solely to blame. ""The weather is getting colder, so people are socialising more indoors,"" she said. Professor Baxter said waning immunity was another key factor. ""You do have some immunity after having a COVID infection... usually people are protected pretty well for 60 days and have some protection for three months,"" she said. ""We're well past the three months for the people that got Omicron over the Christmas period, so those people are now at risk again. ""And people that got boosted, they had protection from transmission close to that Christmas time, but the protection from transmission does wane or decrease faster than the protection from serious illness or death."" Professor Baxter said the past week had demonstrated the effect of those changes. ""We'd reached a plateau where we hadn't gone down because we continued to relax our restrictions and protections,"" she said. ""Now we're seeing that trend actually reverse, so it's not flat anymore, it's going up."" Earlier this month, the Victorian government confirmed Omicron sub-variants, known as BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5, had been detected in Melbourne's wastewater. In total, wastewater detections have picked up the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-variants 15 times, and the BA.2.12.1 sub-variant has been detected five times. Monash University's head of epidemiological modelling, James Trauer, said tracking those sub-variants was important because they appear to be more transmissible than the current dominant sub-variants. But he said it was ""too early"" for them to be leading to an increase in cases. ""There does seem to be a bit of a resurgence,"" he said. ""We do need to look for things that could explain this change."" He agreed with Professor Baxter that the change in weather, with people spending more time indoors, was likely an important factor behind the increase. Just a week after Victoria marked the grim milestone of more than 3000 deaths from COVID throughout the pandemic, Professor Baxter warned more hospitalisations and deaths would inevitably follow the rise in cases. ""It's not going to be tomorrow,"" she said. ""We know that these things take seven to 10 days to become apparent in the hospital system, and even longer than that to become apparent in the number of people dying of COVID."" She said there wasn't an ""appetite"" to bring back restrictions like indoor mask-wearing, but encouraged people to take steps to protect themselves by wearing ""high quality, well-ventilating"" masks. Professor Baxter also said getting the 30 per cent of people yet to receive booster shots in Victoria jabbed would help mitigate the effects of the increase. Despite 94.6 per cent of Victorians aged 12 and over having received two doses of a COVID vaccine, just 66.8 per cent of those aged 16 and over have received three doses — a figure which has barely budged for weeks. She said the healthcare system had already been under strain for some time. ""It's not ending, you have these new surges of COVID on top of a flu season and it's just going to get to the point where the hospital system is at real risk,"" Professor Baxter said. Dr Trauer said a renewed push to encourage eligible people to get COVID-19 booster vaccines would help curb the effects of the current uptick in cases. ""Vaccination won't necessarily have a big effect on transmission and won't bring the case numbers down, but it could bring the hospitalisations and the deaths down,"" Dr Trauer said. ""We're still getting a substantial number of deaths and there's a substantial strain on the health system as well. ""The best way to prevent that is to vaccinate people at high risk to prevent those severe outcomes after they've been infected."" Federal government data from May 10 showed that 90.7 per cent of the 175,640 Australians in aged care had received three or more COVID vaccine doses. This International Nurses Day, we're recognising the unparalleled efforts of those working on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr Trauer said flu vaccine subsidies should be extended to include more people, including children. At the moment, the flu vaccine is free for children up to age five, people aged 65 and over, pregnant women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and those with some medical conditions. Any change to the those eligible for a free flu vaccine under the national program is dependent on advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI). Dr Trauer said making the flu vaccine more accessible would help alleviate the pressure simultaneous COVID and influenza waves would put on the health system. ""We shouldn't be mandating it,"" he said. ""But we have barriers in place that are preventing people from getting flu vaccine as we head into a really dangerous Omicron/flu period.""

102,The parkrun tablet: How an unusual prescription saved Steve's life and is inspiring a change in GP practice,health," Sport Why the parkrun practice initiative will encourage more GPs to engage in social prescription Steve Connelly describes it as a feeling of being ""completely unplugged"". In 2018, Steve and his wife Tamarah were playing a pre-dinner game of backgammon in their Mackay apartment. According to Tamarah, Steve became very quiet, before closing his eyes and making ""groaning sounds"". He lost consciousness for about 10 seconds, before coming to. ""I thought I better have a lie down, which I did,"" Steve Connelly says. ""But I didn't get any better."" While Steve was recovering, Tamarah called their regular GP — Jennie Wright — in their home town of Adelaide, who instructed her to call an ambulance. While he lay in hospital under monitoring, Steve would have another 10 similar events before a cause was found. Steve's heart was stopping. ""They couldn't work out why it was stopping, but it was stopping for about 10 seconds at a time,"" he says. ""The doctors said, 'Look, what you need — first off — is to keep the heart going. So you need a pacemaker. And then you need to find out what's causing it to happen.'"" They also told him that the relevant surgeon in the area was away, so it would be best if they returned home to Adelaide for the life-saving operation. ""So in the space of a few days, I went from putting along nicely in Mackay, living a good life to all of a sudden being on a plane, not exactly sure what was going on,"" he says. ""Jennie [our GP] organised the specialists and a pacemaker was inserted a couple of days later."" With their lives turned upside down, Tamarah noticed a significant shift in Steve. ""He is normally very confident and outgoing, but he completely changed,"" she says. ""He was very anxious, very unsure of himself and lost a lot of confidence. ""And we were both very nervous about leaving each other because I was scared he was going to collapse."" As Steve describes it, their world, once big, became ""very small"". Having suddenly quit his job as a technical writer in Mackay, and with their house rented out in Adelaide, Steve and Tamarah moved into a caravan park. For six weeks after his operation, Steve was unable to lift anything heavier than 2 kilograms, or raise his arms above his head while the wires of his pacemaker set. ""My whole focus then became my health,"" he says. ""I thought, 'Am I going to die?' 'What can I do?' 'What can't I do?'. It was quite confronting."" Tamarah says he became ""very depressed"". At this point, Steve returned to see Dr Wright at her Adelaide clinic. As he relayed the changes in his mood, she began to type on her computer, before printing out a script. ""I thought, 'oh, this is antidepressants or something similar -- something I didn't really want',"" Steve says. What Dr Wright prescribed, however, was not medication: it was a script for ""parkrun"". Quantity: 5km, once a week, with five repeats. ""He was just expecting it to be a tablet,"" Dr Wright recalls. ""He said, 'what's this parkrun tablet?'"" In writing Steve Connelly a script for parkrun, Dr Wright undertook what in the UK and elsewhere is commonly known as ""social prescribing"". At its simplest, social prescribing refers to the practice of referring patients to local, ""non-medical"" activities or services. Examples might include suggesting a patient join a group activity like tai chi or meditation classes. In a recent survey of almost 3,000 Australian GPs, 69 per cent said they were already ""prescribing"" parkrun to their patients, while 87 per cent said they would consider doing so in the future. In Dr Wright's case, the choice to prescribe Steve parkrun was an evidence-based decision rooted in personal experience. Now a veteran of no less than 250 parkruns, Dr Wright started going to parkrun during a difficult patch of her own, initially, she says, as a form of ""stress relief"". ""I started running on the treadmill, but I was too self-conscious [to go outside] thinking people would be critical,"" Dr Wright says. ""I was really scared. I thought an overweight, middle-aged woman trying to run is a bit stupid looking."" When her brother told her about parkrun, she reluctantly agreed to go, assuming she would hate it. ""I thought all these athletic people would be very scathing on someone like me,"" she says. ""But it wasn't like that at all. It was a very welcoming environment."" After giving Steve his ""prescription"", she offered to join him and Tamarah on their first parkrun. ""It made us feel safe, knowing Dr Jennie was there,"" Tamarah says. ""We also knew there were defibrillators at the event, so there was help there if we needed it."" It turned out to be a fateful choice; 61 parkruns later, Steve has come a long way from Mackay. While at first he walked the 5km parkrun course — which is a choice open to all participants — he eventually built up to running. To his own disbelief, in October 2021, Steve would go on to compete in a half-marathon, cheered on by a group of friends and, of course, Tamarah. ""I was in tears, just picturing where he was back in Mackay,"" Tamarah says. ""And then thinking about him at Dr Jennie's, being so depressed. The progression to doing parkrun and being able to walk, then run and then do 21 kilometres was just unbelievable. ""Jennie giving us that parkrun script really changed our lives. It showed him that he could actually do things."" Steve says crossing the 21km half marathon line also gave him pause to reflect on his journey. ""I thought, 'how in the world did I do this?'"" he says. ""Considering where I was before; I wasn't even walking. I'd take the car everywhere. ""Now the future is much bigger. All these doors have been opened which I definitely thought were closed. I've got choices; we can do things I never thought were possible before."" Today, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) will announce a formal partnership with parkrun, encouraging more GPs to refer their patients to parkrun by signing up as official 'parkrun practices'. A similar initiative was rolled out in the UK in 2018, which has seen 74 per cent of all GP practices refer patients to parkrun. According to RACGP president and adjunct professor Karen Price, the parkrun partnership is particularly attractive because of its capacity to address high rates of chronic disease in the community. ""Up to 49 per cent of chronic diseases have a basis in modifiable risk factors,"" Dr Price says. ""Social prescribing is an opportunity to embed patients in community activities that can address some of those risk factors. ""People with chronic illness don't just suffer from diabetes, for example, they often have a component of mental [ill] health that goes with that. ""It's a bit of a vicious cycle; the more disabled you become, the more challenging it is to maintain your mood and level of wellbeing."" In this context, she says, community activity is as much about social connection as it is physical activity. ""Community activity gets people up and going,"" she says. ""With parkrun, you can do 5km on a Saturday morning, it's free, you can walk, you can run, you can crawl, you can spectate, you can be one of the volunteers. ""That contributes a lot because obviously the exercise is good, but so is mingling and feeling a sense of belonging in the community."" Diane Sinclair, another one of Dr Wright's patients, can attest to this. Like Dr Wright, she started parkrun in a bid to relieve stress, but was also seeking a non-pharamaceutical solution to blood pressure problems. She has now participated in more than 100 parkruns, and goes as far as planning her holidays around parkrun locations. While each parkrun course might be different, she says, the sense of community is permeable. ""Last year, we had five deaths in the family in five months,"" she says. ""My niece had pancreatic cancer, and we knew she wasn't going to last. The people at parkrun knew what was going on and they were really supportive. ""There was a rainbow the day of parkrun after she died. I remember I just stood there and everyone came over and said: 'That's there for a reason, isn't it?' ""They all understood why I was just mesmerised by this rainbow."" Last year, a group from her local parkrun also joined her family on a charity run to raise money for cancer research. ""We're a very tight-knit group of people. We always get together at the end or beginning of a parkrun and have a chat or go for a coffee, it's really nice. ""It makes you feel like you're part of something bigger."" Glen Turner, parkrun's head of health and wellbeing, says his hope is that the RACGP partnership gives more people like Steve and Diane access to the health and wellbeing benefits this sense of community brings. Chris was never a runner, but now he’s winning ultramarathons, and he credits parkrun kicking it all off. ""What we learned during the pandemic is that parkrun isn't about the 5 kilometre course, it's about the communities that it creates,"" he says. ""Coming out of pandemic restrictions, 71 per cent of our participants surveyed said the reason they came back to parkrun was to feel part of that community. ""When you ask people who they trust the most, it's GPs first and daylight second — and they're having conversations with people who have a lot to gain from those peripheral benefits of parkrun.""

103,How Queensland's way of solving a nationwide problem has revealed a more insidious issue,health,"  Integrity in question when Queensland mulls how to measure ambulance ramping Ambulance ramping is a growing problem in every state and territory according to the latest comparison by the Australian Medical Association, but Queensland has been accused of coming up with the worst way to solve it — and it reveals a more insidious issue. The AMA's report card released on Thursday showed every jurisdiction failing to meet its own targets for getting patients transferred out of ambulances and into emergency departments – commonly called ambulance ramping or patient off-stretcher time. For example, Queensland sets a goal of getting 90 per cent of patients off an ambulance stretcher and into ED within 30 minutes. It happened just 65.2 per cent of the time last financial year and has worsened over recent years. South Australia is arguably the poorest performer, with 54.1 per cent of patients off a stretcher in 30 minutes, and that was a key issue in the state election in March that saw the Liberal government of Steven Marshall toppled. But it's been dogging the government of Annastacia Palaszczuk in Queensland for some time and a report last December by the Auditor-General quantified the collective waste of paramedic's time waiting outside hospitals – 111,000 hours. That was a 76 per cent increase on the year before. Now, they often say in brainstorming sessions that ""no idea is a bad idea"" but I'll leave it up to your judgement about this one. According to documents obtained under Right to Information by Nine News this week, health officials discussed changing the methodology so that instead of the clock starting when the ambulance pulled up to the emergency department, it would only begin when the patient was seen by a triage nurse. The implication was quickly detected by a senior ambulance official, who estimated the simple accounting change would cut 60 to 120 hours a day off the time paramedics were recorded as waiting. ""This can't be seen as improvement rather than just a different capture method,"" Acting Queensland Ambulance Service Commissioner Craig Emery wrote in the email obtained by Nine News. You can read the email chain here. The story lit up question time in state parliament brighter than an ambulance on full lights and sirens in the Clem Jones Tunnel. ""Is the government's solution to the worst ambulance ramping in the country to fudge the figures, not fix the ramping crisis?"" Opposition Leader David Crisafulli thundered. Health Minister Yvette D'Ath admitted discussions were going on about changing reporting methods. ""I am aware that department officers, the hospital and health services and the Queensland Ambulance Service were having frank and honest conversations around measurements,"" she said to a rowdy chamber. ""But there has been no change in the patient off-stretcher time measurements or targets set here in Queensland."" Queensland Health has form in this area. Back in the 2000s, the government of Peter Beattie — facing a blowout in elective surgery waiting times — was accused of hiding the true figures because the waiting list did not count people on the waiting list to see a specialist. In effect, the waiting list for the waiting list. But it is not just a feature of health. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. An entire audit report in 2017 was devoted to the politically sensitive topic of crime statistics, which found them to be ""questionable at best and unreliable at worst, and should be treated with caution"". It must be noted that Queensland is hardly the lone ranger when it comes to using statistics to reframe a political problem. When New South Wales was facing backlash in the early 2000s over trains running late it simply redefined ""late"", shifting it from four minutes after the scheduled arrival time, to five minutes. Hey presto! The trains suddenly are more ""on time"" than before. Only last year, the New York Times revealed the US government hid a 2019 airstrike that killed dozens of civilian women and children in Syria by reclassifying many of those victims as Islamic State fighters. It followed previous stories that under the Obama administration all military-age males in a strike zone were counted as combatants unless explicit intelligence proved them innocent. All governments are faced with the temptation to massage information damaging to its political fortunes. The difference in Queensland is the Premier has already been warned she has a problem in her public service and will soon have a report on her desk about it. Former QUT vice-chancellor Peter Coaldrake was commissioned in February to review the culture and accountability in the Queensland public sector and last month published an interim report. ""There is a view, repeatedly shared, that public service advice is too often shaped to suit what are assumed to be the preconceptions of the people receiving it, that the price for frank and fearless advice can be too high and the rewards too low, and that there is reluctance to depart from what is perceived to be the 'official line',"" the interim report said. In other words, public servants have been conditioned over many years to incorporate a party political dimension into their policy advice. The threat to the perceived independence of the public service is obvious. If the final report from Professor Coaldrake reflects his interim concerns, then this will be a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the Premier to underscore that honesty, transparency and accountability are also the touchstones of a properly functioning public service.

104,'We were crying at the airport': Australians flee Shanghai over harsh COVID lockdown,health,"  Vivian breathed a sigh of relief when her family's flight from Shanghai touched down in Sydney last month. Their arrival marked the end of a long journey for the 34-year-old, her husband and their two children, who left the city of 25 million people after being locked down for almost a month. ""We were fleeing,"" Vivian said. ""We were lucky to be able to leave, but so many people are not in [that] position. ""I feel like we abandoned our neighbours… they were really happy that we were able to go, but I felt terrible leaving them."" Vivian's family moved to Suzhou, a city near Shanghai, in January 2021 when her husband landed a job at a Chinese university, before relocating to Shanghai earlier this year. Last month, the family decided to return to Australia after seeing increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases in their neighbourhood and due to fear of the government separating infected children from their parents. Australians living under Shanghai's strict COVID lockdown say taking infected children away from their parents is ""inhumane"". ""People have been taken away in the middle of the night from our lane. Screaming. It was awful,"" Vivian said. Vivian only wanted to be known by her first name because her husband might return to China later this year to continue working at the university. Australian government data shows 594 citizens and permanent residents travelled from Shanghai to Australia during March and April this year. But it is unclear how many of those travellers were expats living in Shanghai, or travellers from other parts of China transiting through Shanghai — a major travel and transit hub — to return to Australia. Since March, the Chinese government has been fighting to keep an Omicron-fuelled outbreak under control with a strict lockdown that has forced many residents to remain inside their home for weeks at a time. Just as the city looked set to relax restrictions as case numbers continued to fall, authorities again tightened the rules earlier this week. Notices issued in several districts ordered residents to stay home and barred them from receiving non-essential deliveries for several days. On Friday, health authorities reported 1,869 new local asymptomatic coronavirus cases were recorded on May 12, up from 1,305 a day earlier. Confirmed symptomatic cases rose from 144 to 227. Despite the tight rules, Vivian said foreigners living in Shanghai were able to apply for an exemption to travel to the airport to leave China. Shanghai authorities may be loosening the city's COVID lockdown, but after weeks of uncertainty, foreign workers are considering leaving. Vivian said the family also had to pay $600 for PCR tests before they travelled and one-way flight tickets cost them $9,000. But their bid to leave China was further complicated after their eight-month-old daughter's passport was left in Suzhou, where they lived before moving to Shanghai. Shanghai's restrictions made it almost ""impossible"" to pick up the passport, said Vivian. But luckily, 48 hours before their flight, Vivian was able to retrieve the passport with the help of her husband's colleague. This involved paying $400 for a taxi driver to pick it up and courier it to Shanghai. Vivian said she and a fellow passenger broke down in tears from their relief at being back on Australian soil after fleeing Shanghai. ""We cried at the airport,"" she said. Shanghai residents have struggled to get enough food, medical supplies and other basic goods during the lockdown. Australian expats in the city who spoke to the ABC several weeks ago said they were at breaking point. Some Australians caught up in Shanghai's extreme five-week lockdown say the Australian government has done little to help its citizens in distress. They also questioned whether the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) could be more proactive about advocating for citizens forced from their homes or those seeking to leave the country. A DFAT spokesperson told the ABC in a statement the Australian Consulate-General in Shanghai continued to ""engage directly with local authorities on COVID-19 response measures, including in relation to access to the airport."" ""We continue to provide consular assistance to Australians in Shanghai, including those seeking assistance to travel to the airport,"" they said. In a previous statement, DFAT had said the Consulate-General had raised concerns about the separation of family members ""at senior levels with the Chinese government"", and was continuing to support the Australian community despite the ongoing challenges. Shanghai officials have repeatedly emphasised that Shanghai has an abundant food supply, and the government was working hard to meet people's medical demands. But Vivian said her family also struggled to get enough food during lockdown. She said the only food they received from the local government in the first 14 days was a bag of vegetables on the first day. ""We just felt completely abandoned,"" she said. Vivian said she was a member of two WeChat groups, each with about 500 expats from different countries wanting to leave Shanghai. She said since returning to Australia she has had to put her WeChat on silent. ""I'm having trouble looking at it. I feel pretty overwhelmed if I open my chat messages and see what's still going on [in Shanghai]."" It's not just foreigners feeling the impacts of the lockdown and wanting to flee Shanghai. Shanghai resident Renee Yao, 23, is looking forward to leaving the lockdown to study in Melbourne later this year. Ms Yao has booked a flight in July but is worried her schedule might be affected if the lockdown is still in place. She has been stuck at home since March 24 and had struggled with a shortage of food supply and mental health issues. ""I cry a lot. And sometimes I don't even know what I'm crying about afterwards,"" she said. ""When will this prison-like life end?"" Despite the challenges, Ms Yao said she was looking forward to her new life in Melbourne. Shanghai's strict lockdowns are part of China's COVID-zero policy, which has kept the country's borders closed since early in the pandemic. President Xi Jinping recently re-emphasised the importance of sticking to the policy at a party conference earlier this month. ""We are resolutely fighting against all words and deeds that distort, doubt and deny China's epidemic prevention principles and policies,"" he said. ""We won the Wuhan defence battle and will win the great Shanghai defence battle without any doubt."" Despite the lack of certainty around the end to Shanghai's lockdown, some Australians remain unfazed. Chinese Australian Will Lin said he had no plans to return to Australia, as his career in the financial analysis industry had just ""gotten on track"". ""I prefer to stay here,"" he said. Mr Lin, a Sydneysider, moved back to China in early in 2020 for Lunar New Year just before the pandemic hit. He said his experience of Shanghai's lockdown wasn't as bad as some others, despite being stuck in a hotel for 42 days. ""I don't need to worry about food. Our hotel provided breakfast and they ordered food deliveries for us for lunch and dinner,"" he said. ""We have heating and air-conditioning."" Mr Lin added the COVID situation in Shanghai was already getting better and he believed he would be out of lockdown before too long.

105,Shea lives with Down syndrome and had to fight an 'archaic' law to win back her right to vote,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Melbourne woman Shea MacDonough is 36 years old and excited to be voting in her first federal election. Ms MacDonough, who lives with Down syndrome, was taken off the electoral roll by her parents in 2012. They were concerned she didn't understand the voting process and were worried they could influence her vote. But no one realised how hard it would be for Ms MacDonough to get back on the electoral roll when she wanted to. It was during Australia's same sex marriage referendum in 2017, that Ms MacDonough decided she wanted to have her say. ""My cousin and her partner, they're both gay, and I wanted to be on the same sex marriage vote so I could vote for that,"" she said. With her parents' support, Ms MacDonough went onto the electoral roll website to re-register but later received a letter from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) saying she'd been rejected. Quoting a section of the Commonwealth Electoral Act created in 1918, the letter said she'd been removed from the roll ""by reason of being of unsound mind"" and being ""incapable of understanding the nature and significance of enrolment and voting"". That upset Ms MacDonough, as it said she could not be restored to the roll unless she provided ""documentary evidence from a medical practitioner"" that she was now ""capable of understanding"". ""I wanted a say in future elections... and they thought I couldn't quite understand, but I do understand,"" she said. Ms MacDonough penned a response to the AEC, which helped kick-start the process of getting her back on the roll. The re-enrolment process took three months and meant she missed out on voting in the same sex marriage referendum. Since being re-enrolled later in 2017, Ms MacDonough has participated in the Victorian state election and is looking forward to voting in the federal election on May 21. Natalie Wade, vice president of Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, said the ""unsound mind"" provisions, which are still in place, ""disproportionately"" impacts people with disability. She said they'd been removed in ""droves"" from the electoral roll compared to people without disability. ""We're really concerned that in 2022, we still have these laws in place,"" Ms Wade said. ""The current wording... targets people with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disability and cognitive impairment, who have not been afforded the right to education, who may have low literacy, who have not been afforded the right to social participation or employment."" According to a 2014 report by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC), more than 28,000 people were removed from the federal electoral roll between 2008 and 2012. The AEC did not provide a response to the ABC's request for more current data of the numbers of people removed from the electoral roll. A campaign by 65 disability and legal rights organisations is calling for reform of the ""unsound mind"" provisions, as they pertain to people with disability. An open letter sent to Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese last month calls for ""urgent"" reform during the next term of government. ""The phrase 'unsound mind' is incredibly archaic and is a sign of the times in which it was drafted,"" Ms Wade said. ""It harks back to a time where we referred to people with disabilities in very grotesque ways -- as lunatics in asylums -- but we absolutely must ensure that our laws reflect our current understanding of disability."" Concern about the law is not new. In 2014, the ALRC issued a report calling for the electoral act to be amended. Ms Wade said the laws were ""inconsistent"" with Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which states ""people with disability must be afforded the right and opportunity to vote on an equal basis with others"". The AEC's Evan Ekin-Smyth said it was important a right was not being taken away from someone ""without due process"". ""However, in a compulsory voting system it is also important that an obligation is not put onto an individual who cannot, or can no longer, understand the nature and significance of enrolment and voting,"" Mr Ekin-Smyth said. How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' ""The importance of a provision that provides for removal from the roll in these circumstances would be acutely understood by carers and family members of people with advanced dementia for instance."" Mr Ekin-Smyth said the AEC ""regularly"" received feedback that the words 'unsound mind' were ""not appropriate."" ""We endeavour to be sensitive in our communication,"" he said. ""This is the terminology used in the legislation and can only be changed by parliament."" Earlier this year, Tasmanian teenager Caitlin Woolley wrote about the Australia she wanted as a 19-year-old living with Down syndrome. It was read to the House of Representatives by independent MP Andrew Wilkie. May 21 will be the first federal election in which Ms Woolley will be able to vote. ""I am especially interested in issues of disability... about inclusion for people of disability in their community, in health and in work,"" she said. Ms Woolley is a health ambassador for Down Syndrome Australia and has met with politicians from across the political spectrum, who she said ""wanted to learn more"" about people with disability. Ms Woolley said each person with Down syndrome had ""their own ideas and opinions"". ""People with Down syndrome are valuable members of society, so it's fair for us to have a say about how our country is run,"" she said. ""We need to speak up for what is important to us and being included in voting helps us do that.""

106,"If my disease was better researched, maybe I wouldn't have to experiment with expensive, risky medication",health,"  What risks would you take if you were only able to function for one, maybe two hours a day? The rest of the day, you must lie down with an eye mask on while listening to something quiet. You can't work, exercise or drive. You can't leave the house for more than an hour or two once a week. Would you risk an increased chance of skin cancer? Or possible vision damage and blindness? I would. I am. Many years ago, I woke up one morning unable to move my body from my bed. It felt like a tonne of wet cement had been poured on top of me and I couldn't shift it. I struggled to answer questions, read, remember things and connect ideas. Getting myself up or out of the house to work became an extreme sport. After eight years visiting doctor after doctor, I was diagnosed with a disease known as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME). ME has no treatment or cure. Millions of people are joining this cohort via long COVID, which shares striking similarities with ME. Both patients and doctors are in a murky world of unknowns. But I am one of the lucky ones: I've become a human experiment. If there's a chance a treatment could increase my capacity so I can work, or drive, or socialise independently again, I will try it. When you're trapped with a debilitating illness, any different feeling can be a welcome relief. I experiment with different medications under the guidance of trusted medical professionals. As I see it, medication is technology. Why wouldn't I use technology to try and improve my quality of life? That's not to say it's a simple — or easy — process. For years, I was shunted between different doctors for extensive, expensive tests. They couldn't find anything that medicine had a treatment for. I tried lifestyle changes and alternative therapies to no avail. Finally, I decided it was time to experiment. With predictions that thousands more people could be diagnosed with long COVID, advocates say more research and support is needed for the 250,000 Australians with chronic fatigue syndrome. I was referred to a specialist with an interest in ME and, when I asked him whether there was anything we could try to ""improve my capacity"", he was up for the challenge. Each appointment, we discuss different medications we have heard of in the ME space (all are designed to treat other illnesses). Together, we weigh their potential risks and benefits. My specialist reviews my bloods and decides whether a particular medication is appropriate for me to trial and at what dosage. Each time he says: ""We have no idea what will happen and there are no guarantees"", and I ask about potential side effects to monitor for and hazards to avoid. We discuss how expensive the medication is and where I can find it. Then we monitor my body's response. This morning, I took nine pills. Three of them are ""private non-PBS prescription"", which means they are expensive and untested for treating my illness. Four of the pills slightly increase my brain function — to the extent that I wouldn't be able to write this without them — but neither my doctor or I know why. Some medication trials have been ineffective. One drug caused my vision to blur so I couldn't see or read. My specialist at the time advised me to ""wait it out"" but I decided to pull the pin. Years later, the same medication would end up helping me, I just have to get regular eye tests. Some of the medication has suppressed my immune system and made me vulnerable to dangerous viruses. Some have caused headaches, gut infections, skin infections, staph infections, anxiety, mood swings, drenching night sweats, constipation, diarrhoea, vertigo, twitching, itching... the list goes on. Many of the medications cause nausea. Sometimes it's manageable, sometimes it's miserable. These technologies have a way to go. But on my current regime, I can get up and shower (with my shower seat) most days. Sometimes I can write. If I have notice for a big event with loved ones, I can socialise and recover. For me, these are life changing gains. In an ideal world, though, these medications would be properly tested in controlled studies rather than on very sick people. Some disabilities are ""over medicalised"". Disabilities are often seen as medical problems when many really arise from a lack of accessibility. As Dylan Alcott recently explained, when he is in an accessible space, he is not disabled. It is inaccessible spaces that disable him. This is the social model of disability. Inaccessibility disables me, too — stairs and lack of seating or rest areas limit my capacity to move through the world and participate in society. But I am also disabled by a lack of medical attention, research and funding for my disease. In my experience, the thing that most disables people with energy limiting chronic illnesses like ME and long COVID is that governments, medical funding bodies and scientific research communities do not see the problem. Perhaps one of the reasons for this lack of focus and funding is because most ME patients are women. Diseases predominantly affecting women receive significantly less research funding. This means women and gender diverse people's bodies are still poorly understood in medicine. Shockingly, female animals and humans were excluded from medical testing until very recently. Women have been prescribed drugs for decades without them having been tested on female bodies. Although I've had to grieve my past self, my disability has freed me from the weight of my own expectations about who I should be — and helped me become braver than I ever imagined. This lack of knowledge is compounded by the incentive for doctors to provide short consults, limiting the potential for women's complex illnesses to be properly treated. Together, these factors result in doctors too often distrusting women and gender diverse people's accounts of their own bodies. Millions of people globally, up to 80 per cent of them women, present to doctors with the debilitating symptoms of ME. Some doctors tell us to rest or lose weight or see a psychologist. An infectious diseases specialist smiled at me indulgently and suggested I was ""just tired"" because of my work as a lawyer. One senior immunologist said I would ""probably"" get better because I was not obese and had a positive attitude; there was ""no need"" for a further appointment. Both were wrong because ME is a complex neuro-immune disease. I haven't worked as a lawyer since 2014 and though my optimism has survived, so too has my disease. Funding is urgently needed for research into ME so that one day when I, and millions of others, go to the doctor, they are not only able tell me what's wrong, but how they can treat it. Instead of saying ""we don't know what will happen"", they can say ""this should give you some relief"". For more information about ME click here.

107,How often should we go to the toilet? A gastroenterologist explains,health,"  Why holding back your urge to poop can wreak havoc on your insides – a gastroenterologist explains How often should we poo? If you Google this question, you're likely to find an answer along the lines of three times a day to once every three days. But this leaves room for substantial variation. The true answer is: when you feel the urge. In fact, habitually putting off the urge to poo and slowing the bowel ""transit time"" may be associated with a higher risk of problems such as bowel cancer, diverticulosis (small pouches of the bowel lining protruding through the bowel wall), haemorrhoids and anal tears, and prolapse. That's why the golden rule of gastroenterology is to always heed the ""call to stool"" when the urge strikes. Back in the early 20th century, physiologists determined that a powerful stimulus to open your bowels was eating food and they referred to this this as the gastro-colic reflex. It's often most potent after a fast and, thus, after breakfast. Babies generally void their bowels when the need presents itself. However, as soon as we can make decisions for ourselves — around the same age we start to walk — we learn to suppress this ""call to stool"". There are more than 1,000 species of bacteria fighting deep inside your body. But what does the makeup of that bacteria tell us about our health? Freya Petersen finds out the hard way — by having her poo tested. Learning to control one's bowels is an important developmental step, but some of us take it too far; we discover we can sometimes make this urge go away temporarily if we ignore it for a while, because now doesn't seem like a convenient time. But habitually suppressing this urge can be associated with symptoms including: constipation abdominal pain variable and unpredictable bowel habits bloating wind slower transit of matter through our intestines. We probably know how often we open our bowels, but not many of us are aware of our ""whole gut transit time"". In other words, how long it takes for residue from the food you eat to come out the other end. This transit time is important because having problems with urgency (a sudden, frantic urge to poo), diarrhoea and constipation can all be signs of slow transit. There's a simple way to measure it; swallow a handful of raw sweet corn kernels and then look out for the yellow kernels in your poo. How long should it take for them to show up? It should be somewhere between eight and 24 hours. No one is arguing you should void your bowels wherever and whenever you like. But getting into the habit of putting it off means the residue from the food you eat stays in your body longer than it should. Your transit time lengthens and your quality of life deteriorates. On average, we produce about six tonnes of poo in our lifetimes, composed of water, bacteria, nitrogenous matter, carbohydrates, undigested plant matter and lipids (fats). The longer this mix of stuff sits inside us, the more it is prone to fermentation and decomposition. This produces not just wind but also chemicals known as metabolites, which then sit in contact with the bowel lining and can be absorbed. The idea of auto-intoxication from the colon is not new. From the time of the ancient Greeks, waste products in the intestine were thought to contribute to an imbalance of the four body humors (blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm) critical for good health. Kellogg's, part of the temperance movement in the United States in the 19th century, developed breakfast cereals to deal with both constipation and poor morals, which they believed to be connected. A longer transit time has been linked to a higher risk of significant gastrointestinal problems such as: colonic polyps gallstones and haemorrhoids. Recent interest in the microbiome has also linked dysbiosis (or changes in the bacteria that live in our intestines) with slow transit. So slow transit may also be associated with a wider range of disease linked to gastrointestinal dysbiosis. You can improve your bowel habits by increasing the amount of fibre and fluids in your diet, exercising regularly and being in touch with your colon. Some people are even using cognitive behavioural therapy to improve bowel function. Most importantly, when your colon calls, you should listen.

108,Suspended senior doctor resigns from Mackay Base Hospital amid review into complication rates,health,"  Suspended senior doctor resigns from Mackay Base Hospital amid review into obstetrics and gynaecology A senior Queensland doctor — who was suspended five months ago amid an independent review into obstetrics and gynaecology at the Mackay Base Hospital — has resigned. Philip Reasbeck's resignation as the Mackay Hospital and Health Service's executive director of medical services was announced in an email to staff on Friday. In the email, Mackay HHS chief executive Lisa Davies Jones said a recruitment process would start soon for a replacement. It's the second resignation of a senior doctor at the hospital following their suspension pending the outcome of the review. Although Dr Reasbeck was not involved in the provision of obstetrics or gynaecological services at the hospital, as Mackay HHS's executive director of medical services, he was responsible for professional medical governance. Mackay Health Service's executive director of research and innovation, David Farlow, has been acting as executive director of medical services since Dr Reasbeck's suspension. Ms Davies Jones ordered the ongoing external review into maternity and gynaecological services at the hospital after being approached by patient advocate Beryl Crosby regarding concerns about complication rates. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suspended the hospital's authorisation to train registrars in the specialty eight months ago, before the announcement of the review. The review — which began on November 1 — is investigating maternity and gynaecological outcomes at the Mackay Base Hospital between July 1, 2019, and October 31, 2021. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Headed by obstetricians Dr Ted Weaver and Dr Gregory Duncombe, the review is examining the safety and quality of the services provided, including complication rates. Since the review was called, the ABC has spoken to more than half a dozen women who have described complications following obstetric and gynaecological surgery at the hospital, including cut bladders and ureters. Although these are known complications of surgery, obstetricians say that, if a doctor's error rate is ""higher than accepted"", it should be investigated. The results of the review are expected to be handed to Ms Davies Jones by the end of June and she is expected to make them public. Ms Crosby said she was awaiting the release of the findings of the external review with ""great interest"".

109,SA corrections department agrees to drop ban on political newspaper in prisons,health,"  South Australian prisoners will be allowed to receive a redacted version of a political newspaper ahead of the federal election, under an agreement reached with the Department for Correctional Services. The four-page ""Just Us"" newspaper contains information about prisoner rights and eligibility to vote, and articles outlining the policies of political parties. It has been produced by the Justice Action advocacy group since 2004 and is distributed to prisons across the country. But its circulation was this year barred in South Australia. Lawyers for Justice Action last week brought a legal challenge in an attempt to overturn the decision. The Supreme Court this morning heard the parties had reached an out-of-court agreement that will allow a redacted version of the publication to be distributed to prisoners. Prisoner advocate and Justice Action coordinator Brett Collins said the newspaper supported prisoners' democratic rights. ""This is the newspaper that allows people in prison to read about what the political parties have to say – it's as simple as that,"" he said. ""This newspaper had gone into every jurisdiction in Australia, except South Australia."" In SA, prisoners serving a sentence under three years are entitled to vote in elections. The Corrections Department did not provide reasons for the ban to the ABC last week, but in a letter published on the Justice Action website, the department's chief executive David Brown said the newsletter contained ""proactive and inflammatory material"". Mr Collins said there had been concerns about the inclusion of a motto ""Jailing is Failing"". ""The CEO said this would be likely to inflame or incite prisoners to cause unrest inside the jail,"" he said. ""That's absolutely ridiculous. ""We were shocked, really surprised and disappointed that the approach in South Australian corrections was so bad."" Mr Brown's letter also refers to material that aimed at ""facilitating relationships between prisoners and persons who are not prisoners, contrary to regulation 11(2)"". Mr Collins said contact details for political parties and other organisations, and some references to COVID-19, would also be removed from the publication. He said he believed contact details to be ""crucial"" to prisoners' participation in the election, but said the organisation decided to ""let it go"" because the ""paper is too important"". ""They've now guaranteed every prisoner in South Australia will get a copy of the paper and we're going to reprint the paper for them,"" Mr Collins said. In a statement, a Department for Correctional Services spokeswoman said: ""We are pleased we've been able to reach an outcome that reflects the department's commitment that only acceptable materials will be permitted to be distributed to prisoners. ""We remain committed to ensuring that all eligible prisoners are able to vote and have access to mandatory voting material for the upcoming election.""

110,"Perth public school reintroduces restrictions as state records third day of more than 15,000 COVID-19 cases",health,"  Western Australia could see a COVID-19 caseload of up to 25,000 new infections a day in the coming weeks, the state's Chief Health Officer says. There were 15,565 new cases reported in Western Australia today, the third consecutive day there has been more than 15,000 new COVID-19 infections. Three more deaths have been reported, with 279 West Australians currently in hospital with the virus, 12 of whom are in intensive care, an increase of four from yesterday. Dr Andy Robertson told ABC Radio Perth the state could expect to see COVID-19 numbers rise in the coming week. ""We will continue to see rises over the next couple of weeks and we will probably get between [20,000] to 25,000 [cases] over the next couple of weeks,"" he said. ""We anticipate the numbers will then start to fall after that."" WA takes a giant step towards living with COVID-19, as a whole raft of restrictions are removed. Despite this, Dr Robertson said the timing was right to ease majority of COVID-19 restrictions, which had occurred in April, just days before the state recorded more than 10,000 cases for the first time. He said that lifting the mask mandate seemed appropriate, as data was proving the virus was spreading more in private gatherings. ""What we've seen is that, while all those measures had been very effective in suppressing the outbreak, we were starting to see spread largely being within family groups, within social groups."" Dr Robertson said he encouraged people to continue wearing masks if they felt it was necessary. ""We'd strongly encourage people to consider wearing masks, but they are having a lot less impact than they have had in the past,"" he said. While masks are no longer mandatory for most workers, the vaccine mandate is still in place, with 80.7 per cent of the eligible population having received their booster dose. Dr Robertson said the mandate would be reviewed in the coming weeks. ""[For] some groups — like those dealing with [the] vulnerable — we may want to maintain the mandates, while there may be other groups where those mandate aren't as critical going forward,"" he said. The current COVID-19 outbreak is placing a strain on all sectors, with at least one public school in Perth's western suburbs bringing back restrictions in an effort to stem the number of staff out of the classroom with the virus. The ABC understands parents with students at the school have been told by the principal that the lifting of government restrictions had significantly impacted the school's ability to function. It is understood that the school currently has about half a dozen staff members off work due to COVID-19 and, while that is a figure the school was able to handle for the moment, any more would make it difficult to manage. The restrictions the school was bringing back include cancelling assemblies and other large gatherings, no mixed classes, and limits on the number of students allowed for certain classes. Parents have been told those restrictions would remain in place for the rest of the semester. The Department of Education's director of schools, Bec Bope, said masks were no longer required but staff and students could continue wearing them if they wished. ""Parents and carers are allowed on education sites for outside school drop-off, face-to-face parent-teacher meetings, attending assemblies, volunteering outside of classrooms such as in the canteen and uniform shop, and visits to residential facilities,"" she said. ""Our expectation is that schools follow this health advice from the Chief Health Officer. ""If conditions do change, the Chief Health Officer will advise the department and we will notify schools of any adjustments that need to be made. ""I understand these are challenging times for our schools, but we ask that they contact the department should they require any support or advice.""

111,What ABC readers asked us about the 2022 federal election,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Oh, what a night! The election has been and gone, with the Australian people turfing out the Coalition government to elect Labor for the first time in nine years. Throughout the six-week-long campaign, we asked what mattered most to you and what you wanted to know. We received more than 10,000 submissions on dozens of topics, and you'll find the answers to the most-asked questions below. You can see where the major parties stand on different issues here in this handy guide. It covers a range of key policy areas for the major parties: the Coalition (Liberals and Nationals), Labor and the Greens. The ""teal independents"" are not a political party. It's a label that's been given to a group of mostly female candidates taking on mostly male Liberal MPs in some of Australia's wealthiest electorates. You can read a full profile on each electorate and its candidates here. A ghost candidate is a term the ABC is using to describe someone who has been nominated as a candidate for a seat but who has not been seen or heard from by the constituents of that electorate. An ABC investigation has found ""ghost"" candidates are contesting seats in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. You can still vote for a candidate who has resigned or been disendorsed. There have been instances where disendorsed candidates have run as independents and won. The Coalition (the Liberals and Nationals) has committed to net zero emissions by 2050. They plan to get there by investing more than $20 billion in ""low emissions technologies"" in the next decade. Labor has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, along with a 2030 target of a 43 per cent cut in emissions. The party plans to upgrade the electricity grid, make electric vehicles cheaper, install community batteries and modernise steel and aluminium productions. The Greens want a 75 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 and want to hit net zero by 2035. The Greens want to phase out coal and gas completely and switch to 100 per cent renewable energy usage as soon as possible. The Coalition plans to work with the private sector to increase the uptake of EVs, hybrids and hydrogen powered vehicles, and will fund 50,000 new EV chargers. Labor wants to upgrade the electricity grid and introduce an electric car discount. The Greens are pushing for an ""electric vehicle revolution"" and plan for all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. The Reserve Bank of Australia sets interest rates. The government generally does not set, or put a cap on, interest rates. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has advocated for the minimum wage to be lifted 5.1 per cent in line with inflation, but has stopped short of saying he would formally submit that figure to the independent wage umpire. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says a 5 per cent increase could take a real toll on small businesses. The Coalition halved the fuel excise in the federal budget ahead of the election in late March. But it's only temporary with the cut due to expire at 11:59pm on September 28, 2022. Labor has not offered to extend the fuel excise cut past September. The Coalition will allow first home buyers to use up to 40 per cent of their super, capped at $50,000 or $100,000 for a couple, to help them buy a home. This would apply to both new and existing homes. The amount removed will be returned to the superannuation account, plus a proportion of the capital gains, when the house is sold. But to take up the scheme buyers need to have at least a 5 per cent deposit. Regardless of which party wins the election, a scheme that helps first home buyers purchase a property with as little as a five per cent deposit, or 2 per cent deposit for single parents, will be extended. The Home Guarantee Scheme sees the government guarantee up to 15 or 18 per cent of a loan, meaning buyers can avoid paying lender's mortgage insurance. The Coalition has also pitched a regional housing scheme, which is very similar to one first announced by Labor. It would offer 10,000 5 per cent deposit guarantee spots to people (not just first home buyers) who buy new homes. By comparison, Labor's scheme would also offer 10,000 5 per cent guarantee spots to first home buyers in regional Australia looking to buy existing or new homes, as long as they'd lived in the area for 12 months already. Labor is offering to help 10,000 households a year into home ownership as part of a ""shared-equity"" scheme and will also expand the first home buyers scheme. In shared equity schemes, the government covers part of the cost of a property, that can then be bought by the home owner over time. These types of schemes are already run in Victoria and Western Australia. The Coalition is encouraging Australians aged over 55 to downsize to smaller homes, by extending an existing scheme. The idea is that by people selling their larger family homes, younger families will have more options in the property market. Sale proceeds will be exempted from the assets test for two years instead of one, and people will be allowed to deposit up to $300,000 into their superannuation without any penalties. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has promised to match the offer. The National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) makes rent more affordable for 22,000 properties nationwide. It is due to end in June 2026. There is no further or replacement government incentive, though rent can't be changed until end of the lease period. ABC's election analyst Antony Green does not believe the UAP will be in a position of power to push the policy as, at most, it could get one Senate seat this election. Neither major party likely to form government — the Liberal/National Coalition or Labor — has indicated any support for the idea of a mortgage cap. The budget forecast deficits of around $80 billion this financial year and in 2022-23. Over the longer term, the budget forecasts deficits for at least the next decade. Net debt is set to peak at $864 billion in 2026, which is an improvement on a $1 trillion forecast in previous budgets. The Coalition government is keeping the permanent migration cap at 160,000 places for 2022-23 but will increase the proportion of visas dedicated to skilled migrants to about 70 per cent. Labor has indicated it will announce a policy before the election to make it easier for foreign workers to become permanent residents. The Bureau of Statistics uses a labour force framework to calculate the rates of unemployment and participation. You can see an example of how that's done here. October 2022. Liberal Prime Minister Scott Morrison has effectively ditched his commitment to establish a national anti-corruption watchdog. Labor says, if elected, it would create a National Anti-Corruption Commission by the end of the year. The Greens want to see an independent National Integrity Commission created. Several high-profile independents have campaigned on establishing a national corruption watchdog as a key election commitment. Donations worth less than $14,300 do not need to be declared, meaning smaller fundraising drives by political parties will often not be included in the disclosures. It is also possible for large donations to be made with multiple cheques just under that threshold. Money donated to political parties in the 11 months before the May election will not be made public until February 2023. The Liberals are promising to have staff spend at least three hours and 20 minutes per day with each aged care resident from next year. At least one nurse would have to be on shift, across a minimum of 16 hours per day. The Coalition government has not publicly backed a case in the Fair Work Commission to raise aged care workers' wages. Labor is promising to have a registered nurse on site at all times of the day. It would require staff to spend at least three hours and 35 minutes with each resident — in line with the aged care royal commission's recommendation. Labor also supports the push for an increase to workers' wages and will fully fund any increase. Party leader Anthony Albanese has admitted the party will need to recruit overseas health workers as a ""stopgap"" measure. Anne Ruston, who has been nominated as the next health minister if the Coalition wins the election, says they will not cut Medicare. Labor says its long-term goal is for dental services to be included in Medicare, but has not stipulated a time frame to achieve that. The Greens are the only party with elected representatives in parliament promising to introduce universal access to free dental care. Dental is not included in Medicare because it was considered too complex and too expensive to include in the scheme. The Coalition says it'll lower the cost of medicines on the PBS by $10, meaning the maximum cost will be $32.50. Labor's gone slightly further than the Coalition, promising to lower the cost of medicines by $12.50 to a maximum cost of $30. The Coalition has not offered any substantive new policies relating to the Pacific during the election campaign. Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne has largely focused on selling the government's record in the region under the Pacific Step-up — including defence training programs, assistance tackling illegal fishing, the expansion of Australia's diplomatic network in the region and reforms to Pacific worker schemes. She ha also spruiked the government's push to help vaccinate the region from COVID-19, with more than 32 million doses sent to countries in the Indo-Pacific. More than 3 million of those doses have been sent to Pacific Island nations. Labor has pledged to provide $525 million in foreign aid over four years to Australia's Pacific neighbours. It would also add 3,000 permanent migration places for Pacific Islanders and allow seasonal workers to bring their families with them. Labor is also promising to expand Australian broadcasting in both the Pacific and the broader region, and explore potentially restoring Australian shortwave radio broadcasting. Chinese-owned company Landbridge signed a 99-year lease on the Northern Territory facility in 2015. The government had decided to privatise the port for $506 billion in a bid to save it from crumbling, given its potential for future economic growth. Despite reports of Landbridge's alleged close ties with the Chinese Communist Party, which has recently increased its presence in the Indo-Pacific region, the Defence Department says there are insufficient grounds to revoke the lease. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also said the government has no authority to intervene with the lease agreement. We haven't heard any pledges from either the Coalition or Labor to increase age pension payment rates during the election campaign. The Greens want to lower the pension age to 65 and have proposed a scheme that would boost age pension payments by up to $244 per fortnight. Katter's Australian Party wants the payment to go up by $200 a fortnight. It also wants to increase the amount pensioners can earn before their payments are reduced. The United Australia Party wants to increase the pension by $180 a fortnight. The Coalition and Labor have pledged to freeze the deeming rate for two more years. Both major parties are also promising to raise the threshold for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. An asset test is already in place for Australians seeking to access the full pension. The test considers whether you're part of a couple and whether you own your home. Generally, the asset limits test does not include your principal home and up to the first two hectares of land it is on — but the rules are different if you own and live on a farm. As part of a policy to encourage older Australians to sell their home, the Coalition is promising to leave any proceeds of a sale out of the pension asset test for two years, rather than one. Labor has matched the policy. The Coalition government brought forward its childcare subsidy changes from July to March this year. Labor is proposing a more generous subsidy scheme basically across the board, providing larger subsidies of up to 90 per cent and lifting income thresholds significantly. Labor's long-term goal is to provide a universal, 90 per cent childcare subsidy to all families. The Greens want to make child care essentially free by ditching the income and activity tests needed to get the subsidy. The Coalition made significant funding changes to universities in 2020, more than doubling the cost of social sciences degrees while making nursing, maths and teaching degrees cheaper. It also provided more support for regional and remote students. Labor would cover the cost of 465 thousand TAFE spots over four years, and create 45,000 new TAFE places. Labor is also promising to create 20,000 new university places with a focus on areas where there are currently skills shortages. The Greens want university and TAFE to be free for everyone and for all student debt to be wiped out. Labor's pitch to parents involves topping up funding to underfunded public schools in the 2023 school funding agreement, but it is an aspiration and not a promise. The Coalition's plan is to do this by 2029. You can cast your vote at a polling booth on Saturday, May 21 between 8am and 6pm (local time). You number the candidates on the ballot paper in order from your first choice (1) to your last. Preferential votes are counted until one candidate gets more than half of all the votes. If your first choice doesn't get enough votes, your vote may be reallocated to your second choice. Voting below the line for the Senate means your vote goes directly to an individual candidate, rather the candidates preferenced by political parties. If you vote below the line, you must number at least 12 boxes from 1 to 12. There has never been an ability to vote in an Australian federal election on the internet using a personal device. The results of three NSW local government elections that used online voting in December 2021 were ruled as being invalid after the system malfunctioned. The AEC has recommended that phone voting should be extended to those who have tested positive since last Friday (May 13) at 6pm, in cases where they have not voted early or applied for a postal vote. Voters will need to provide proof of the date and time of their positive PCR result or the serial number of their RAT.

112,COVID pandemic sees more people seeking help for opioid dependency linked to illegal Kamini herbal product,health,"  Shortage of illegal Kamini balls due to COVID pandemic sees more people seeking help for opioid dependency Australia's coronavirus pandemic has revealed a little-known addiction to an illegally imported herbal product allegedly sold under the counter in some Asian grocery stores. COVID-19 lockdowns have resulted in supply shortages and price increases for Kamini balls, which derive their major constituent from the opium poppy. At least 12 people who had developed a dependence on Kamini balls sought help for withdrawal symptoms from four south-east Queensland opioid treatment clinics in the 18 months between January 2020 and June 2021. They complained to doctors of poor sleep, agitation, craving and inability to stop using the Indian herbal product. Brisbane addiction medicine specialist Jeremy Hayllar said he believed the problem was likely to be ""fairly widespread"", with other cases reported in Perth, Sydney and in Queensland's north. ""One patient commented that the retail outlet that he went to seemed to be doing very well, it was very prosperous, which suggests that there is a significant market, but it's all rather difficult to verify because what is happening is not legal,"" Dr Hayllar said. A study of the south-east Queensland cases, published in Drug and Alcohol Review, found the majority were men with a median age of 32, who had been using Kamini balls for between six months and eight years. They were in stable relationships and all but one were working. Eleven of them were migrants born in India. Seven of the 12 patients had worked in the ride-sharing industry. Although Kamini balls are an Ayurvedic medicine promoted to enhance sexual function, Dr Hayllar said patients had told him they had started using the herbal product after being advised it would give them ""more energy to enable them to work longer hours"". ""It's a real paradox because opioids tend to make you lazy and sleepy — they generally don't give you more energy,"" he said. One patient had started using Kamini balls for dental pain. Australia's medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has banned the importation and supply of Kamini balls. But patients have told addiction specialists the product was readily available and sold ""under the counter"" in Asian grocery stores and through online retailers. Dr Hayllar, clinical director of Metro North's Mental Health Alcohol and Drug Service based in Brisbane's inner-city, has been working in addiction medicine for 20 years, but had never previously treated a patient addicted to Kamini balls before the coronavirus pandemic hit. He said supply shortages of Kamini balls and corresponding price hikes during the pandemic had prompted users to seek help through public opioid treatment clinics. Writing in Drug and Alcohol Review, Queensland doctors said patients had told them prices had increased from $110 for a bottle of 40 Kamini balls to $180 a bottle during the COVID-19 pandemic. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. They said the patients were using between two and 30 Kamini balls a day, with a median use of 13 balls per day. ""I think corona really has something to do with the reason why patients have come forward for treatment — supply dried up with the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Dr Hayllar said. Dr Hayllar said all 12 patients had been successfully treated with medications to suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings. ""Treatment allows people to live healthy lives once more,"" he said.

113,Amrita's parents felt helpless as they watched her dying. Now there are calls for a policy overhaul,health,"  Calls for changes to Victorian hospital policies following death of 8yo Melbourne girl Calls are increasing for easier ways to request a second medical opinion in Victoria, following the death of an eight-year-old girl at Monash Children's Hospital in Melbourne last month. Amrita Lanka died 21 hours after being admitted to Monash Children's Hospital in April, with her parents claiming their concerns were ignored by the hospital. Monash Health said it had since contacted the family to offer support and that an investigation would be undertaken. In addition, the incident has been referred to Safer Care Victoria and the Coroner's court. Amrita's story has triggered new calls for change in the health system, with families now sharing their own experiences in the Victorian hospital system that mirror those of the Lanka family. When Keshanee De Silva brought her five-week-old son Azariah to Monash Children's Hospital last November, she had little idea of how traumatic the experience would be. Ms De Silva said she was initially told it was a dietary issue and was sent home, only to see her son's condition worsen. It took a 10-hour wait in the emergency department the next day before infant Ahmad was admitted to the children's ward. Ms De Silva said she was repeatedly told that her son was fine and would be able to go home, but her instincts told her something different. ""I kept saying to them 'he's not breathing properly … I can tell something's not right',"" she said. Ms De Silva said she was left without help for most of the day, and when ringing for assistance would be left waiting for half an hour at a time for anyone to arrive. She decided to seek a second opinion. ""I spent probably eight, nine hours that day telling nurses what my concerns were,"" she said. ""Eventually when I felt like I wasn't being heard, I took advantage of the internal avenue where you can call the number and let them know."" Do you know more about this story? Email vicindepth@abc.net.au. If you're sharing sensitive information, read our tips on how to contact us confidentially. After escalating the situation through a phone call asking for a second opinion, Ms De Silva said the hospital sent in a doctor who again dismissed her concerns. ""The doctor was patronising and using standard de-escalation language but was not actually listening to my concerns,"" Ms De Silva said. She said eventually a unit manager arrived who was more empathetic and understood her concerns. Azariah was discharged after his symptoms marginally improved, although Ms De Silva believes the hospital had little to do with his recovery. ""I could really relate to [Amrita's] mother's experience because of what we went through at the same hospital,"" Ms De Silva said. ""You sit there and think, 'that could have been us, that could have been anyone'."" Health bodies are now calling for patient escalation systems like the one Ms De Silva used at Monash Children's Hospital to be standardised and implemented at every hospital in the state. Australian Patients Association chief executive Stephen Mason said that patient escalation systems active interstate — where families can raise concerns if a patient's health condition is getting worse — are not as all-encompassing in Victoria. ""We know that in Queensland there’s such a system and I believe in WA there’s such a system, so I think after this tragedy it needs to be considered in Victoria,"" he said. In Queensland, the patient escalation procedure is known as Ryan's Rule, named after toddler Ryan Saunders who died in Rockhampton in 2011, with the coroner finding his death may have been prevented if he had been treated in a timely manner. In Western Australia last year, Aishwarya's Care was established following the death of a seven-year-old and subsequent inquiry into her treatment at Perth Children's Hospital. In Victoria, there is no blanket system for all hospitals like in other states. While an escalation pilot program was launched in 2019 by Safer Care Victoria called HEAR Me, patient escalation is still determined by individual hospital policy. Review launched into death of Amrita Lanka after parents claim their concerns were ignored In a statement, a Monash Health spokesperson defended its escalation policies, saying they were clearly accessible to all patients and families. ""Our patient escalation procedures are displayed visibly in all areas within our emergency departments, wards and website,"" a Monash Health spokesperson said. For families like the Lanka family who were interacting with hospital staff in their second language, there may be additional barriers to requesting a second opinion. The family said they were not aware that escalating their daughter's case was an option. Mr Mason said this was common in many of the stories he had heard. ""The main complaint is lack of communication,"" he said. ""When they feel totally neglected and don't know where to turn to or who to talk to, that's when they start to panic."" While other states were spurred by tragedies to enact changes in health policy, the Victorian government has still not committed to introducing a standardised escalation policy. ""Should Monash, Safer Care [Victoria] or indeed the Coroner's processes identify any areas where we can do better, then of course we would support that,"" Health Minister Martin Foley said. The Opposition has criticised the inaction, calling it another sign of a health system in crisis. ""The entire system is in crisis, it can't cope. This is a dire situation when you've got the tragic story of that little girl,"" Shadow Health Minister Georgie Crozier said. ""They've had no response from government, they've had no apology, they've had nothing."" Mr Mason said parents who experience the tragedy of losing a child are motivated not by a desire for compensation or revenge, but for positive change. ""They want to know what's gone wrong, they want transparency, they want to know the truth,"" Mr Mason said. ""They want to make sure it never happens to any other parent.""

114,Keeping up with the Kardashians: Women turning to cosmetic surgery to be 'ethnic but not too ethnic',health,"  Why new cosmetic surgery trends that 'pick and choose' from cultures raise cultural appropriation concerns Who wins and who loses when beauty trends celebrate cosmetically altered looks that are ethnic — but 'not too ethnic'? Growing up in Sydney, Petronie was taught to be proud of her Blackness. The message was instilled in her by her mum and dad, who are from Zambia and the Republic of the Congo, respectively. ""They were always telling me that I'm Black and I'm beautiful, and just making sure I really believed that,"" Petronie says. Though it was powerful, it still couldn't shield the 26-year-old model and influencer from pervasive western beauty norms. In 2007, when US reality TV stars the Kardashians shot to fame, Petronie was one of the millions of people around the world who began noticing physical alterations in the sisters. In particular, she watched Kim Kardashian's ""nose changes over time"". And whenever Petronie used social media filters — which tweak facial features, often for comedic or beautifying effect — she noticed that some shrank the size of her nose. By the time she was 21, Petronie decided she wanted cosmetic surgery, too. ""I wanted my nose to be a bit thinner and pushed up,"" she says. But Petronie is acutely aware that while cosmetic surgery can erase some features like a non-Caucasian nose, it can also emphasise others, like big lips or almond-shaped eyes. That cosmetic procedures allow people to capitalise on the desirability of those cultural features — while removing others — is a pop culture paradox, and it's impacting the steadily growing number of Australians who are opting for cosmetic procedures. Many are weighing up the relationship between their culture and their appearance, in the face of trends that promote a look of ethnic — but, some argue, ""not too ethnic"" — ambiguity. Adria Goldman is assistant professor of communication and digital studies at the University of Mary Washington in the US. She says the term ""Blackfishing"" describes ""an act of cultural appropriation where someone non-Black tries to present themselves as Black"". That could be through darkening their skin, adopting an Afro-centric hairstyle, or getting a more voluptuous shape, through photo editing or even butt augmentation. ""Oftentimes [it's] for profit or some other personal gain,"" she says. Blackfishing is a criticism that's been levelled at the Kardashians, and other celebrities including Australian singer Iggy Azalea, British singer Rita Ora and American singer Ariana Grande. Some accused of Blackfishing or of cultural appropriation have counter argued that in fact they are enacting cultural ""appreciation"", Dr Goldman says. But, she argues, while intent is worth considering, ultimately it's not the point. ""A person can appropriate Black culture and say that their intention was not to do harm — but appropriating Black culture does do harm,"" she says. It can reinforce ""surface level"" or ""misinformed"" ideas about Black culture. ""It's commodifying this culture with no gain to Black people."" Like Petronie, social media consultant Natasha also watched the Kardashians' appearances morph over time. Natasha is Middle Eastern-Australian and was very insecure about her appearance when she was growing up. ""I never felt like I was the pretty girl, ever. And I think that was because … I was around mostly white people,"" she says. By the end of high school, she had endured years of teasing about her looks. Yet, at the same time, reality TV was demonstrating that appearance isn't fixed. ""I started realising, oh wow, things can be changed,"" Natasha says. So at 18 years of age, Natasha, who is now 26, began cosmetic enhancement — first lip filler, then rhinoplasty or a nose job — to alter what she calls her ""ethnic nose"". But she says that modifying her cultural features has come at a cost. While she publicly, and proudly, identifies as a woman of colour, she says she's been criticised online for having ""absolutely no features that correlate with a woman of colour"" and for being ""white passing"". For Natasha, such statements diminish her personal experience. ""They don't know the torment I went through growing up,"" she says. ""I start to think it's my fault because I've changed my ethnic features. ""But it's so wrong."" Natasha says the comments also diminish the discrimination faced by her Aramaean forebears. ""My people have gone through so much persecution … and even my parents, moving to Australia [have endured] so much hardship,"" she says. The criticism levelled at those who undergo cosmetic surgery to modify their cultural features is one that philosopher and physician Yves Saint James Aquino is familiar with. He has studied the ethics of cosmetic enhancement, specifically blepharoplasty or double eyelid surgery, a procedure that is most popular in South East Asia. Dr Aquino, who is also a research fellow with the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, says people who undergo this surgery are often criticised for ""betraying their heritage"" or being ""a race traitor"". He argues it's a reductive position to take. ""Heritage and culture is more than appearance,"" he says. Dr Aquino believes that people, women specifically, ""should be able to do whatever they want with their body"". But he also believes that ""choice"" to undergo body or face modification is a concept that ""we have to interrogate"" in the context of media, peer group and broader societal pressure. ""Even if no one's pointing a gun at your head, you live through all these pressures, all these directives … [so] is that an authentic choice?"" One of those pressures is social media. Dr Aquino knows of cosmetic surgeons who report that their clients want ""to change their face based on specific [social media] filters"". He says other clients want to alter their noses because the angle of a selfie gives the illusion of an increased nose size. ""So it's a very weird, perceptual thing that's influencing their self-image … it's the way they hold their phone,"" he says. The cosmetic enhancement industry in Australia is booming. We meet the people chasing their aesthetic ideal and those jumping off the cosmetic enhancement conveyor belt. Gemma Sharp has also noticed shifts in cosmetic surgery requests. A clinical psychologist and Senior Research Fellow in the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre, Dr Sharp leads the Body Image Research Group. She says there's been a move away from a ""traditional facelift, which is used to 'rectify' ageing processes"". Rather, ""preventative"" procedures such as fillers are becoming more common among younger people. Dr Sharp says the expansion of the sorts of people having procedures is thanks to reduced costs, increased availability and the normalisation of cosmetic surgery through the media. ""People who tended to seek cosmetic procedures were more likely aged 30 and over in the past, but now we are seeing people seeking them as young as late teens and 20s."" In the last five years or so, there's been a sharp increase in the use of injectables (such as in wrinkle-reducing or lip-filling procedures) in Australia, and the Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) operation, which ""is the fastest growing cosmetic surgery in the world"", Dr Sharp says. At 2018, Australians were spending more per capita on cosmetic surgery than in the US, with anti-wrinkle (Botox) injections the most popular operation at the time. Cosmetic surgery wasn't on the mind of 14-year-old Kina when she started posting selfies on social media. For a long time, Kina, who has Indian heritage, only posted photos with filters applied to them. At first, the filters were ""cute hearts"" or ""a nice background"", she says. ""And I was like, that's lovely."" Then she realised the filters could also ""slim down my nose … make my nose look upturned … make my lips and eyes bigger [and] my face slimmer"" and ""significantly lighten my skin"". ""I looked like a white person,"" Kina says. It began to change the way she thought about herself. ""I was just like, am I not pretty otherwise? It came to the point where I could not take a photo without a filter because I would look at myself and find all these little faults."" Kina started to ask herself, ""Why can't my nose be slimmer? Why can't my lips be bigger? Why can't my face have more of a structure to it instead of being so round?"" She recognised the filters' ""toxic"" influence and today she tries to avoid them. But she's concerned that she and her peers are bombarded on social media with ideals about an ""unattainable body"". ""[The beauty ideal] is very much centred around white women having racially ambiguous features, like those big lips, the very Middle Eastern and South Asian brows and eyes, and Black bodies,"" Kina says. ""It's just very unsustainable because nobody actually looks like that."" And it sends a powerful message of inadequacy to teenagers online. ""If I went and asked younger girls around my age, 'Do you have insecurities? Do you hate anything about yourself?', so many girls will be like, 'I hate my body, I hate my face [or] how my lips look or [how] my eyes look,'"" Kina says. ""If you ask them, 'Do you want to get surgeries when you're older?' so many girls will say, 'Yes, I can't wait.'"" Kina says race, and racism, is front and centre of the problem. ""People will go, 'Oh, this part of your ethnic features? Ugly. But this part? I want this part so bad … Your nose is flat, that's gross; but your eyes, they're so pretty.'"" What do people of colour, who've often been racially vilified for their appearance, have to say about others cherry-picking their features? Dr Aquino describes this as a ""mixed race"" western beauty trend that privileges ""racial ambiguity"". ""All of a sudden, you're beautiful because you look ethnic, but not too ethnic',"" he says. ""There is a certain range where we find things to be acceptable."" Dr Goldman says there's a powerful marketing opportunity within that range. ""One of the things about the Kardashians and about racial ambiguity in general is that individuals have the ability to sit in the middle of this white and non-white [identity], reaping the benefits, while avoiding the costs."" Petronie has noticed an increase online in the presence of big hips, big lips and big bums in young women, including among white women. For her, it demonstrates an inescapable hypocrisy. ""I find it interesting because [white people] were teasing us before because Black people had big lips. ""And now that's what you want. ""When you're not Black and those are Black features — the lips and even the hair, like braids — it's cultural appropriation,"" she says. Petronie argues the act of assuming physical features or styles that are typical of a culture other than your own — full lips or full hips, or cornrows, for example — brings with it some responsibility. If you emulate Black culture, she says, ""then I want you to keep that same energy when it comes to issues that are happening within the Black community"". Stand with the Black Lives Matter movement, for example. ""Make sure that you're an ally. Don't just pick and choose what parts of our culture suit you, because Black culture is not a trend,"" Petronie says. Rokeshia Ashley, an assistant professor at Florida International University who specialises in body image and modification, wants to move on from talking about the Kardashians. She says plenty of Black women are now ""taking hold of this conversation"" and are ""also using their bodies as social capital"". She points to public figures such as model Blac Chyna, entrepreneur Jai Nice or influencer Eliza Reign as examples. Whether through modelling clothes or paid social media sponsorships, the women are creating revenue ""how they see fit"", she says. ""Although it may seem morally compromising to some, they are well within their right to govern their bodies autonomously."" Dr Ashley says rather than consider body modification — a term she uses to include cosmetic surgery as well as changes to hair or make-up — as inherently bad, we should be more ""receptive and supportive to what Black women want to do with their bodies"". Black women's bodies ""have always been governed"", whether by slavery or health institutions, or through other means, Dr Ashley says. ""Globally, with anti-Blackness, we didn't have the opportunity to be able to say, 'This is what I want to do with my body.'"" Whatever that choice is today, she supports it, so long as it can be done safely and with all the education and information at hand. Unlike some of her online critics, Natasha doesn't conflate her cosmetic procedures with her relationship to her cultural background. ""I'm very, very proud of being Middle Eastern,"" she says. And she's happy today with her slimmer nose and other cosmetic modifications, which she says have ""definitely made me more confident"". Petronie, on the other hand, decided against cosmetic surgery, and is also content with her decision. Her nose job idea was discouraged by her partner and, after considering it for a while, Petronie agreed she didn't need it. ""[I thought], you know what, I'm just going to embrace my culture [and] embrace my nose,"" she says. ""This is a Black person's nose. This is not every Black person's … but it's who I am. It's part of my history, my background. So I think I will be keeping it.""

115,'A tragic milestone': United States records 1 million deaths from COVID-19,health,"  The United States has recorded more than 1 million COVID-19 deaths, the White House says, with the country reaching a once-unthinkable milestone two years after the first cases up-ended everyday life. In a statement, US President Joe Biden said it marked a ""tragic milestone"" for the country that has recorded the most COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began. ""One million empty chairs around the dinner table. Each an irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a nation forever changed because of this pandemic,"" he said. ""As a nation, we must not grow numb to such sorrow. ""We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible, as we have with more testing, vaccines, and treatments than ever before."" The 1 million mark represents roughly one death for every 327 Americans, or more than the entire population of San Francisco or Seattle. By the time the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had claimed 36 lives in the United States. By June 2020, the US death toll had surpassed the total of the country's military deaths in World War I and it would exceed the American military losses of War World II by January 2021 when more than 405,000 deaths were recorded. The disease has left few places on Earth untouched, with 6.7 million confirmed deaths globally. Last week, the WHO said nearly 15 million people were killed either by COVID-19 or by its impact on overwhelmed health systems during the past two years. The estimation is more than double the official death toll of just over 5.4 million. Millions of Americans eagerly rolled up their sleeves to receive COVID vaccines after distribution began in late 2020. By early 2021, the virus had already claimed a staggering 500,000 lives. At one point in January of that year, more people died from COVID-19 every day on average than were killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers say three out of every four US children have been infected with the coronavirus and more than half of all Americans have signs of previous infections. COVID-19 preyed on the elderly and those with compromised health, but it also targeted young people, killing more than 1,000 children. Researchers estimate 213,000 US children lost at least one parent or primary caregiver during the pandemic, taking an immeasurable emotional toll. With the COVID-19 threat subsiding after the Omicron wave last winter, many Americans have shed masks and returned to offices in recent weeks. Restaurants and bars are once again teeming with patrons, and the public's attention has shifted to inflation and economic concerns. But researchers are already working on yet another booster shot as the virus continues to mutate. ""By no means is it over,"" said top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci at a recent event. ""We still are experiencing a global pandemic.""

116,"Cost of living relief centrepiece of WA budget, but no wage increase for public sector workers",health,"  Premier Mark McGowan's second budget as Treasurer has delivered another significant surplus and some relief for households, but few surprises. After a record-high $5.8 billion surplus in last year's budget, this year's budget delivers a slightly reduced surplus of $5.7 billion. Like previous years, that's largely because of increases in mining royalties, increased taxes and the state receiving more GST money than expected. ""This is another strong budget that helps set Western Australia up for a bright future beyond the pandemic,"" Mr McGowan said. The most significant measure announced today was a $400 electricity credit for every household, which will cost the state $455 million in total. Other cost of living support will largely come through household fees and charges increasing by less than the state's predicted inflation rate. Support for the state's ailing health system remains below what many in the sector would have liked to see. The budget contains a total of $2.5 billion for health, including an extra $629 million to fund services over the next year – a 12 per cent increase to what had been estimated in last year’s budget. Almost everything else for the sector had already been announced, including $223.4 million in new money for infrastructure and a similar amount to reduce pressure on emergency departments. The Premier said his government was doing everything it could to help the system, but there was little hope of short-term relief. How will you benefit from the WA government's huge budget surplus? And who will miss out? Find out with our handy guide. ""What we're doing is using our strong financial position to invest heavily in the health system and make sure we can deal with the demand as it arises,"" he said. ""There's no overnight fixes here because of the COVID environment we're in. ""But we're certainly leaving no stone unturned in terms of new initiatives we're putting in place and the new investment we're putting in place."" While inflation jumped 7.6 per cent in Perth at the last estimate, the Premier was confident it would settle at around 4 per cent across the current financial year, falling to 2.75 per cent next year. A raft of household fees and charges will increase from July 1, including electricity (up 2.5 per cent), water (up 2.5 per cent), vehicle licence (up 3.8 per cent), drivers licence (up 6.4 per cent) and the emergency services levy (up 5 per cent). However, Mr McGowan said fees and charges would drop by 3.8 per cent when the electricity credit is taken into account, delivering a saving of $244 for households. Concession card holders will get $718 towards their electricity bills because they will be eligible for the one-off payment of $400 as well as the $318 energy assistance payments. ""We don't have to borrow the money to do it either, as other governments have. It's funded from our strong surplus,"" he said. ""At a time of real pressure at the bowser and at the check-out, my WA Labor government is delivering real relief to Western Australians right across the state."" While another strong surplus has been forecast this year, next year's is expected to be much smaller at $1.6 billion. Aiding those figures will be climbing GST revenue over the years ahead, from $5.9 billion this year to $7.4 billion in 2025-26. This year's surplus had also been estimated at far below what has been delivered, which Mr McGowan put down to conservative iron ore price expectations. ""Iron ore prices have gone up, our revenue's increased because of the booming property market and booming employment market in Western Australia,"" he said. And while net government debt is forecast to fall to $29.9 billion this year, it's expected to rise to $31 billion next year and $34 billion in 2025-26. The state's economy is estimated to have grown by 5.25 per cent in the current financial year, before slowing to 4 per cent growth next year and continuing to fall until 2024-25. Those figures are a result of West Australians being largely locked in the state for the last two years, delivering a boost, before spending returns to more normal levels over the years ahead. One of the few new announcements in today's budget was significant changes to try to stimulate growth in parts of WA's housing sector. Starting mid next year, the government will offer a 50 per cent land tax concession for some build-to-rent developments. That is hoped to increase rental stocks in the state, and is similar to schemes used in other states. It will also be cheaper to purchase off-the-plan apartments worth less than $500,000, with purchasers to receive a rebate equivalent to what they pay in stamp duty. Mr McGowan continued to celebrate what he framed as his government's successes in managing the state's finances, while taking aim at other leaders around the country. ""I suspect they'll be green with envy. Some of them will look like they've swallowed a bumble bee,"" he said. ""All the other states have not run their finances as well as Western Australia. ""That's the reality, and so they need to cut their cloth to meet their circumstances. That's what we did when we came to office."" He also spoke of WA's contributions to the national economy, particularly over the last two years. Western Australia's reliance on China remains the cornerstone of the state's riches. Other commitments in this year's budget are $1.3 billion to try and diversify the state's economy, including money to attract international industries and students, as well as tourism marketing. A total of $650 million will be spent on climate action, which includes a rebate on electric cars announced earlier this week. Almost $33.9 billion will be spent on infrastructure projects in the coming years, including $12 billion in regional areas. Mr McGowan acknowledged many projects would be affected by cost increases, but could not point to any specific blowouts. He said $350 million had been allocated to absorb those increases. A number of Metronet projects are expected to be delayed, with budget papers revealing the State and Commonwealth governments would spend an extra $379.5 million over the coming years on the Thornlie-Cockburn and Yanchep lines. While the $400 electricity credit has been welcomed by welfare groups, the Western Australian Council of Social Service (WACOSS) said a more targeted approach was needed for vulnerable households. ""That $400 won't go very far because we're talking about 12 per cent increases in rental prices, we've got a 7.6 per cent increase in inflation, we've got real stagnation in wages,"" WACOSS CEO Louise Giolitto said. Treasury forecasts the soaring cost of living will cool off in the coming years, however, public-sector unions believe the budget should have included a wage increase. Despite rising inflation, no improvements were made to the pay rise announced in December of a 2.5 per cent increase, plus the option of another 0.25 per cent or one-off $1000 payment. ""This is a budget that fails public sector workers,"" said Unions WA secretary Owen Whittle. ""The state government needs to review the [wages] policy and they need to come to the table with at least a 4 or 5 per cent pay rise for public sector workers, if not far more to keep up with the increasing cost of living."" The comments were mirrored by the United Workers Union. Welfare groups say promises made in the campaign amount to ""window dressing"" for those living in poverty. ""This budget is a kick in the guts for workers, who next week are going to have to try and work out how they're going to pay bills and how they're going to put food on the table,"" public sector coordinator Kevin Sneddon said. ""I have members who are one pay packet away from sleeping in a car ... that's how close they are to poverty at the moment,"" he said. WA's Health Services Union and the WA Police Union have also demanded better pay conditions to attract more workers. Opposition leader Mia Davies questioned how WA could be the wealthiest state in the nation while also having a ""crumbling health system, a housing crisis and more and more West Australian households struggling to make ends meet"". Ms Davies said the benefit of the power credit was cancelled out by rising water charges (up 2.5 per cent), vehicle license (up 3.8 per cent), drivers license (up 6.4 per cent) and public transport fees (up 2 per cent). The emergency services levy will also rise by five per cent. ""This Premier doesn't get gold stars for economic management as much as he likes to pat himself on the back,"" she said. ""You can't deliver multi-billion dollar surpluses two years in a row and not share the wealth of the nation with families and households that are struggling to make ends meet."" Meanwhile, the state's business lobby congratulated the state government for holding firm on its wages policy and said it delivered a ""good budget"". ""We're now getting below $30 billion in net debt ... that's critical for the future of the state's finances,"" said Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief economist Aaron Morey. However, while Mr Morey said the measures to lower the tax burden on WA businesses was welcomed, he felt more could be done. ""Now businesses can pay their payroll tax quarterly instead of monthly [and] that does reduce that admin burden,"" he said. But in terms of that overall amount of tax paid, there is much more the government can do.""

117,Are you a winner or a loser in Mark McGowan's 2022 Budget?,health,"  WA Budget 2022: Winners and Losers With its huge $5.7 billion surplus — though slightly less than last year's $5.8bn — the 2022 WA budget offers a plethora of riches for the state. But what's really in it for you, and who will benefit the most? A $5.7 billion surplus means there's a lot of money in the coffers and a renewed imperative to spend it wisely. The windfall comes courtesy of surging commodity prices, primarily from iron ore, and despite a global pandemic that has seen other economies struggle. It dwarfs the government's own estimate of a $2.4 billion surplus just five months ago in the mid-year economic review, but comes in well below the $8 billion estimated by ratings agency Standard and Poor two months ago. Next year's surplus is projected to be a more modest $1.6 billion, with the iron ore price expected to drop to $US75 a tonne. Last year's budget estimated prices as high as $US121 a tonne, and in recent months it has climbed well beyond that. However, the more conservative estimate going forward is a reflection of ongoing global volatility. While the government claims the surplus is the result of prudent economic management, the Opposition is demanding to know why the health system is in crisis, given the riches the state is awash with. It also thinks state debt should be addressed. Net debt remains high, at $29.9 billion, and is set to increase in coming years, rising to $34 billion by 2025-26. The crisis in the health system was laid bare this week when ambulance ramping figures skyrocketed — and the government is hoping $252 million in new funding will help alleviate some of the problems. The money is earmarked for 17 projects which the government hopes will free up hospital beds and ensure people get better healthcare when they most need it. These include more aged care beds, emergency department nurses, and an expansion of telehealth services. There's also an extra $181 million for mental health and drug and alcohol services. Separately, the budget also contains $1.3 billion in COVID-specific health measures, including the provision of more free rapid antigen tests. Mental health funding gets a $181 million boost, including funding for drug and alcohol services. There are more staff for the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, and a virtual support service for at-risk children. However, cost blowouts and delays have impacted the Karratha and Broome step-up, step-down facilities, which will now cost an extra $3.9 million. Planning to buy an electric car? The WA Government will rebate you up to $3,500 if you buy one for less than $70,000 as part of a $60 million package to accelerate the use of zero-emission vehicles There's also money to upgrade the state's charging station infrastructure. But it's not all good news if you're an EV driver. There's also a new per-kilometre tax being introduced for EVs to help pay for road maintenance, currently set at 2.5 cents per kilometre but pegged to rise with inflation. WA residents will get $400 off their electricity bills in a one-off measure to help with the escalating cost of living that the government says will see the average household get three months of free electricity. With inflation running at 5.1 per cent, it's clear many West Australians are struggling, despite the state's strong economic position. But it's not all good news for bill payers, with other household charges set to rise 2.5 per cent, including a two per cent rise in public transport fares. This is higher than the 1.75 per cent rise forecast in last year's budget. But taking into account the one-off payment, Mr McGowan says householders will actually see fees and charges decrease 3.8 per cent overall. Among the rise in household fees and charges is a significant hike in driver's licence fees, up 6.4 per cent.to $93.70. It'll cost you more to license your car too, with vehicle licensing up 3.8 per cent, to $414.92 on average. And if you think you can avoid the price hikes by taking public transport, think again. Fares are up two per cent, though student fares have not changed. With WA's borders largely closed for two years, and many tourism operators brought to their knees, the government is keen to throw out the welcome mat to visitors in a big way. There's a $21 million marketing budget to attract interstate and international visitors, as well as $31 million for major events. There's $19.3 million to entice people to view next year's total solar eclipse from WA, best viewed from Exmouth, with a major event planned for the region. And one of Fremantle's major drawcards, its World Heritage-listed prison which was built by convicts in the 1850s, will get $12 million. With more than 18,000 people in the state on the waiting list for public housing, and private rentals few and far between, housing is at critical levels across the state. This year's budget is focused on incentives for developers to boost supply, including a 50 per cent land tax concession for new build-to-rent projects. There are no new state housing building projects listed in the budget this year, but $31.4 million has been allocated to spot purchases of existing housing stock. With the unemployment rate the lowest in the nation at 3.4 per cent, it's a good time to be looking for a job in WA. The government estimates almost 69,000 people will have found a job by the end of the current financial year, and about 29,000 people next financial year. The participation rate is also sky-high at 70 per cent, which the government says is the highest on record for any state. There is more money for education, with the total spend up 4.7 per cent or $264 million. The emphasis is on students with special needs, with $32 million in extra funding being provided. This includes specialist learning programs for students with autism, which will be expanded to eight additional schools. There is also money for the development of a new framework for students with disabilities and complex behaviours. Last December's mid-year economic review provided long-sought-after relief for public servants, when the annual price cap on public sector wages was lifted. That pay freeze had been in place since the McGowan government was elected in 2017. A pay rise of 2.75 per cent per annum over two years was announced in December, but unions have signalled their unhappiness with a deal that falls well behind inflation. They will be sorely disappointed with today's budget, which offered no further improvements, despite Perth's inflation rate running at 7.6 per cent in the past quarter according to the ABS, and national inflation at 5.1 per cent. As already mentioned, there's money to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles and for charging infrastructure. There's also $31 million for climate action research and $62 million to get Rottnest Island to transition to 75 per cent renewable energy. Ending logging in state forests and supporting communities transitioning away from the native timber industry is also funded to the tune of $30 million.

118,Hunter Valley Police allege seized cocaine 'destined' for the Scone Cup,health,"  Hunter Valley Police allege seized cocaine 'destined' for the Scone Cup NSW Police have arrested a pub licensee as part of investigations into alleged drug supply activity ahead of a major horse racing event in the Hunter Valley this weekend. The licensee of the Thoroughbred Hotel in Scone is among three men arrested on drug supply charges, following what police have described as an ""extensive investigation"". The Scone Cup starts tomorrow and is one of the biggest horse racing events in the state, attracting thousands of visitors to the small Upper Hunter town. Officers from Strike Force Bunks, which was established by Hunter Valley police in December 2021, swooped on Wednesday. There is no suggestion the arrests are linked to this week’s massive cocaine haul at the Port of Newcastle. A 37-year-old man was arrested at the Thoroughbred Hotel about 3pm, before the premises was searched as well as two homes in the Scone area. Detective Inspector Matt Zimmer told the ABC that the police will allege that the man was involved in the supply of cocaine ""on an ongoing basis in the Scone area"". ""It became evident to us that the cocaine seized by police yesterday was destined for supply and use over the course of the next few days, coinciding with the Scone Cup,"" he said. Police say a number of items were seized and will undergo forensic examination. The man is facing six charges including drug possession and supply, and police will also allege he was supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis, and permitted the sale of drugs at the licensed premises. Det. Insp. Zimmer said the seized substance was undergoing forensic testing to determine its purity, and will allege the amount is a ""greater than an indictable quantity"". Meanwhile, Surry Hills detectives arrested two men, aged 30 and 42, at a local hotel earlier on Wednesday. During a subsequent search of the men, who police say are also from Scone, police will allege they located cocaine and cannabis, which were seized for forensic examination. The pair was charged with supply and possession offences and granted bail. The three men will appear in Scone Local Court next month.

119,"South Australia records 4,696 new COVID-19 cases and seven deaths",health,"  South Australia has reported another seven deaths of people with COVID-19, as well as 4,696 new infections. SA Health said the deaths were of three women and four men, aged in their 80s and 90s. The number of hospitalisations has dropped from 232 yesterday to 210 today, with seven of those in intensive care and two on ventilation. After hovering around 21,000 in recent days, the number of total active cases has jumped back up and sits at 23,183. Eight deaths were reported in SA yesterday, and there have now been 393 fatal cases in the state since the start of the pandemic. The daily figure of 4,696 is about 400 more than the number reported yesterday and coincides with a slight uptick in the number of PCR tests administered. Authorities in recent days have been urging flu vaccinations ahead of winter, partly to reduce pressure on the health system. Earlier today, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) released data showing ambulance ramping in the state had worsened in the 2020-21 year. The AMA report showed that only 54 per cent of patients were transferred from ambulances to hospital emergency departments within 30 minutes — significantly less than the 90 per cent target. SA was the second-worst ranked state, after Tasmania, but outperformed the ACT and Northern Territory. SA Health Minister Chris Picton said easing pressures on the system would be a major focus of next month's state budget. ""We outlined a plan over four years — this involves building new hospital wards, significant investment in mental health, staff need to be trained and hired,"" he said. ""The focus is on making sure we are building additional capacity, hiring additional doctors and nurses.""

120,WA's COVID death toll climbs as cases remain at high levels,health,"  COVID case numbers in Western Australia have dipped slightly from yesterday's record, however the state's death toll from the virus has risen, with six more deaths reported to WA Health overnight. Yesterday more than 17,000 cases were recorded for the first time in WA, but the numbers declined to 16,670 new infections today. As of 8pm last night, WA had 75,581 active cases of COVID-19 with 275 people in hospital, unchanged from yesterday's figure. However, there are now eight people in ICU, one more than yesterday, and a further six deaths have been reported, dating back to May 3. They include two women in their 90s, two women in their 80s, a man in his 60s and a woman in her 50s. WA Health said the death of a woman in her 40s in April has now been reclassified as a non-COVID-related death. The current death toll in WA since the start of the year is now at 169, three more than the number of people who died on WA roads in 2021. According to the WA Health Department, there have been 178 COVID-related deaths since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. Before the start of this year the state had only reported nine COVID-related deaths. Of the 16,670 new infections reported today, 5,317 were confirmed via PCR tests with the remaining 11,353 self-reported positive rapid antigen tests. A total of 16,050 tests were conducted at either state-run or private pathology clinics yesterday, which was almost 3,000 thousand fewer than the day before when 19,360 PCR tests were conducted. While today's figures are slightly lower than yesterday, the recent surge in cases is having an impact on the hospital system. Yesterday, a code yellow was declared at three of WA's major hospitals — Fiona Stanley Joondalup and Sir Charles Gairdner. A code yellow is defined by WA Health as ""infrastructure and other internal emergencies"", and means the emergency department is full and unable to accept patients. AMA WA emergency department spokesman, David Mountain, told ABC Radio Perth it was concerning. ""They're [code yellows] extraordinarily bad,"" Dr Mountain said. ""By the time code yellows are declared, that means there's nothing left in the hospital to open, that patients are basically just jamming up in emergency departments. ""There's lots of ramping, lots of people spending many, many hours in the wait room before they get seen, many other patients spending up to 24, 36, 48 hours down in the emergency department waiting for a bed upstairs."" Dr Mountain said the state of play within the hospital system was ""very, very poor at the moment for any number of reasons"". ""Lack of staffing and lack of ability to open wards is the major one that's just driven what was already a system that was already in deep trouble further into the troubles,"" he said. More than 2,000 members of the state's health workforce are furloughed at the moment, and Dr Mountain said the number of staff off work with the virus was only part of the issue. ""Because of COVID, but not with COVID, so that's part of the issue,"" he told ABC Radio Perth. ""Part of the problem is the bureaucracy, which is always troublesome, means that people who are furloughed but actually don't have COVID, find it difficult to get back into work, there's like a disincentive for people to come in and we need to make that process much simpler. ""Really, it should just be a RAT test [sic] in the morning, if you're negative and you want to work, you should be allowed to come in and work. Confirmed cases so far: 660,064 Active cases: 87,103 Cases in hospital: 323 Deaths: 216 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 81.3 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department ""People are much more likely to be dying at the moment because of lack of staff and people being furloughed than they are from COVID itself."" Dr Mountain said he would like to see a return of the mask mandate to try to get the state's current Omicron outbreak back under control. ""The fact is we had 17,000 [cases] yesterday, it was well over 10,000 on average in the previous week, well above our previous peak,"" he said. ""We're clearly on an escalating phase again at the moment. ""We need to do something to try and stop this and make sure we can actually run a health system that that doesn't, you know, harm people.""

121,"For some of Australia's nurses, working on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic cemented their reason for being in the profession",health,"  Constant exposure to illness and chemicals, shifts extending beyond 12 hours and inescapable feelings of burnout. Nursing is one of the most physically demanding and mentally taxing professions. Throw in a global pandemic and you've got all of the above exacerbated by hazardous work environments, lack of essential resources and inadequate staffing. Despite it all, some nurses have felt a sense of reward and fulfilment beyond imaginable. We spoke to some of those who have worked on the front line during the pandemic in recognition of International Nurses Day. Shikha Prasad, 22, is a cancer care nurse at Metro North Health’s Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital. She provides chemotherapy, education and psychosocial treatments to patients. Often, the patients Shikha cares for are immunocompromised and have a likelihood of developing more severe complications with COVID-19 than the rest of the population. ""Seeing the anxiety this causes in patients has had a big impact in the level of psychosocial care required,"" she said. ""The camaraderie of my colleagues has been incredible. It really has been a team effort to continue to provide the quality of care we do to our community."" Despite the challenges and setbacks the pandemic has created, Shikha remains passionate about supporting patients and nurses alike. ""I’m excited to see the profession of nursing continue to evolve,"" she said. From a young age, Nick McGregor, 60, knew he wanted to be a nurse. But when he first applied to be one at the age of 18, he was rejected because male nurses were unheard of. Now a veteran of the nursing industry, Nick works in the community and aged care space at Pinangba’s Star of the Sea Aged Care Facility on Thursday Island, Queensland. “For close to a year, I spent 6-7 days a week at work, so my lifestyle became work,"" he said. Despite the impacts the pandemic made on his personal life, Nick says he and his team adapted quickly. ""Our staff were already working long days in full PPE, despite very high temperatures. ""It wasn't anything new — we all just got on with it."" Melinda Daniels, 46, is the Assistant Director of Clinical Services at Buderim Private Hospital. She oversees multiple units, including main theatres, recovery, endoscopy and more. With over 200 staff reporting to her, she's in the driver's seat to influence positive change and support a community of nurses. ""I'm very proud that during my 28 years as a nurse, I've managed to fit in having five beautiful children and become a role model to them,"" she said. ""I feel like I've shown them you can work hard and have a successful career, while still having a family."" But Melinda has also experienced her fair share of challenges during the pandemic. ""Like many, I am a working mother, my husband works away and I have five kids,"" she said. Melinda says the biggest challenge for her was introducing home schooling during when schools were closed. ""I'm a very good nurse but I have a new level of respect and admiration for teachers,"" she said. A Clinical Nurse Consultant in Infection Control for Central West Hospital and Health Service, Topaz Stringfellow, 28, says being a nurse means having to be ""resilient and adaptable"". ""I wanted a career that would give me a sense of purpose,"" Topaz said. ""No-one I know went into nursing for the money."" From working in pop-up clinics with ocean views to freezing cold cities and the outback, Topaz says she never saw herself working in these areas. ""The past few years have truly been a mix of highs and lows,"" she said. ""I've learned so many lessons and had lifelong experiences I never thought I would have gotten as a nurse."" Working at St Andrew’s War Memorial Hospital in Brisbane as a graduate scrub/scout nurse, Georgia Stephens, 23, started her nursing career in the thick of the pandemic. While she found it daunting at first, Georgia found a silver lining. ""I was so exhausted from finishing university and starting my graduate nursing year that the lockdowns were a great excuse to stay home and get a few more hours of sleep,"" Georgia said. For Georgia, working in theatre meant that she already had to wear PPE, so most of the COVID-19 restrictions didn't come as a shock to her. ""It was more that I had to start from square one again, since they don’t teach theatre nursing at university. It's a fast paced and tense environment — anything and everything can happen,"" she said. Georgia doesn't deny the fact that the pandemic put a significant mental and physical strain on nurses in every field, but she remains hopeful for the future. ""I’m not sure what the solution is, but I hope it will improve and we can solve it soon for our profession,"" she said.

122,Move to protect abortion rights fails to pass US Senate,health,"  Abortion bill fails to pass in US Senate, as Supreme Court weighs overturning Roe v Wade Legislation to make abortion legal throughout the United States has been defeated in the US Senate, amid solid Republican opposition and support from one Democrat representative. Democrats had sought to head off an impending Supreme Court opinion that is expected to overturn the nearly 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision, which established the national right to abortion. Wednesday's effort was a protest gesture that never stood much chance of success. With 49 votes in support and 51 against, the Women's Health Protection Act was 11 short of the 60 votes needed to be fully debated in the 100-member Senate. All 50 Republicans voted to block the bill. They were joined by a lone Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin. Before the vote, more than two dozen House Democrats, mainly women, marched from the House of Representatives to the Senate, chanting: ""My body, my decision"". They then entered the Senate chamber and sat quietly along a back wall while senators debated abortion rights. US President Joe Biden expressed his disappointment in the outcome of the vote via Twitter and urged voters to elect more pro-choice senators. ""As fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court, Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women's Health Protection Act,"" he wrote. ""They have chosen to stand in the way of Americans' rights to make the most personal decisions about their own bodies, families and lives,"" Mr Biden wrote. ""To protect the right to choose, voters need to elect more pro-choice senators this November, and return a pro-choice majority to the House. If they do, Congress can pass this bill in January, and put it on my desk, so I can sign it into law."" Last September, the House voted 218-211 to pass an abortion rights bill nearly identical to the Senate bill. Although the Senate defeat was widely expected, Democrats hope the vote will help propel more of their candidates to victory in the November 8 mid-term elections, as public opinion polls show deep support among voters for abortion rights. That, in turn, could bolster future attempts to legalise abortion through legislation. The end of Roe v Wade would dramatically impact reproductive rights in the US. It would also likely have symbolic consequences globally, shaping the strategies and tactics of the trans-national anti-abortion movement. America's decades-old battle over abortion rights exploded anew last week when the Supreme Court confirmed the authenticity of a draft opinion that signalled it will soon overturn Roe v Wade. Such a decision would leave it up to individual states to determine their abortion policies. The High Court ruling is expected by the end of its current term, which usually concludes in late June. At least 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion if the top court strikes down Roe v Wade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for sexual and reproductive health rights. Following the vote, Vice-President Kamala Harris condemned Republican leaders in their quest to criminalise abortion in the US. ""Sadly, the Senate failed to stand in defence of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body,"" Ms Harris told reporters in the Capitol. ""What we are seeing around this country are extremist Republican leaders seeking to criminalise and punish women for making decisions about their own body."" For almost 50 years, Dr Warren Hern has performed abortions in Colorado, a liberal safe haven for the women of Texas and other conservative states. Republican Senator John Cornyn called the legislation ""a radical abortion-on-demand bill"" that goes further than Roe v Wade and ""essentially makes abortion available on demand from the time of conception to the time of delivery"". Closed-door talks were held on a possible compromise abortion rights bill, although it was unclear whether Democratic and Republican negotiators would be able to come to agreement, much less lure the 60 votes needed for any such measure. Opinion polls have shown the right to abortion to be broadly popular. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found 63 per cent of respondents — including 78 per cent of Democrats and 49 per cent of Republicans — would be more likely to back candidates in November's elections who support abortion rights.

123,Western Australia is flush with cash but it's not all smooth sailing for the state budget,health,"  Western Australia is overflowing with cash, but despite the multi-billion-dollar surpluses it's not all smooth sailing for Mark McGowan as he prepares to hand down his second budget as Treasurer. Over the last few weeks, he's been proudly telling West Australians they've achieved the COVID ""soft landing"" he's been speaking about for months. Today's budget was meant to be the next part of that – another huge surplus, buoyed in part by strong iron ore prices and the dividends of the state's GST deal. Together with the government's management of the state's finances, it leaves little need for tough measures like cuts or cost hikes. On the government's initial modelling, the COVID peak was meant to have well and truly passed, delivering a near fairytale ending to the pandemic as West Australians embraced living with COVID and case numbers slowly trended downwards. But instead, the Treasurer is handing down the budget as the state endures a soaring second wave, pushing an already teetering health system to the brink, and taking growing numbers of West Australians out of the workforce when they need their paycheques more than ever. The significant surplus will at least soften those blows a little, but still leaves the Premier with one big question: how to spend the billions overflowing from government coffers. Despite daily case numbers now close to double what they were at the state's last peak, many are getting on with living with the virus. High booster rates mean testing positive is nowhere near as bad as it would have been for most, and many workplaces are adapting to the number of people stuck at home. But hospitals and ambulances are not workplaces that can function without sufficient staff on the ground. For years the health system has been struggling to keep up, but now it seems to have reached breaking point. Monday's warning ambulances could be delayed reaching patients was the latest unprecedented height of the crisis – highlighting both the lack of beds to treat patients in and the pressure rising COVID cases are adding to the system. The government has already announced some of what the budget will bring in this area, including $252 million worth of changes to emergency care and $30.1 million (that was promised at the election) for more regional ambulances and paramedics. But the only additional capacity to be announced in Perth is 10 new beds in Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital's intensive care unit. More are on the way before the end of the year, having been funded previously, but even with last year's record surplus, the issue couldn't be resolved. Healthcare staff say they need even more beds and staff, but with an overheated construction sector and global demand for doctors and nurses, neither will arrive soon. ""Real-time"" modelling of WA's Omicron outbreak finds about half a million more people will be infected and deaths will double by the end of June. The Premier has been quick to point out WA's health system is the best funded per capita of all the states, but it seems that still isn't enough. There will be many who hope the past few weeks have delivered a wake-up call to the need for even greater long-term investment. While WA's coffers are overflowing, the battle with rising cost of living has far surpassed COVID as the major worry for most West Australians. For some, it surely will be made worse by a COVID diagnosis leaving them unable to work for a week or more at a time when inflation means their income is stretching less and less. Inflation isn't an issue affecting just West Australians, but the state is copping it worse than many other places around the country. Perth alone saw the greatest jump in inflation over the last year of anywhere in the country – 7.6 per cent, compared to 5.1 per cent nationally. An electricity credit, similar to what the government gave West Australians in 2020 is expected to be one of the measures in this year's budget. Last time it cost taxpayers $600 million and it's likely to be less this year with households receiving a smaller credit. Many West Australians would rightly expect more than that given the money the government has to throw around. The other obvious place to put this year's surplus is into paying down state debt. ""There will never be a better opportunity for any state government, now or in the future, to pay down debt,"" shadow treasurer Steve Thomas said. ""No government will have the level of surpluses that this government has."" Mr McGowan was yesterday keen to make the point he didn't have to choose in this budget between measures to ease cost of living pressures and paying down debt. ""The good thing about my government and Western Australians is we've managed the finances responsibly over our five years in office, which gives us the capacity to do things like that, at the same time we are paying down debt,"" he said. Of course, there's myriad other projects and causes that deserve, and would love to receive, extra funding, and social housing is just one of them. Thanks to pressures on the housing and construction sectors, the number of social homes in WA has barely grown over the last year. Those working in the space want to see more money put aside to buy houses for those who need them, with 18,837 applications on the waitlist at the end of April. It can't be forgotten this all comes just over a week out from a federal election, where Labor is attempting to paint itself as a party of good financial management. ""WA has been incredibly successful over the last few years,"" Mr McGowan was keen to remind the Labor faithful at the party's national campaign launch. ""Some of the best economic, health and social outcomes in the entire world. The lowest unemployment rate of all the states, the strongest set of finances, the only government in Australia in surplus and the only government paying down debt. ""We know that it is Labor governments that best manage our economy and responsibly manage our finances."" The efforts of the Premier, and his government, have certainly been a key part of the reason why WA is in the position it is. It's a fact that certainly won't hurt his party's argument on the national stage. But what may matter most for West Australians is just how much of that success can be put towards making a real difference in their lives.

124,Can't get a haircut? The reasons are lengthy…,health,"  Staff shortages due to lengthy red tape for skilled migrants, employers say Having lost thousands of dollars in business due to staff shortages, hairdresser Elizabeth Stillisano is not sure what to do next or what lies ahead for the future of her small business. Struggling to find suitably qualified staff locally, her attempts to bring in hairdressers from overseas have been stymied by an expensive, long-winded and ultimately unproductive process. Speaking with Nadia Mitsopoulos on ABC Radio Perth, Ms Stillisano said although she had five qualified staff at her Bayswater salon, it was still hard to find senior hairdressers. Since 2018 she has been looking to expand her team, and in 2021 she thought she had found the perfect candidate. ""I had a lovely lady, Leona from Canada, lined up,"" Ms Stillisano said. ""I started the application process in April of 2021 and our business was approved quite quickly as an approved sponsor."" The next step was to make a nomination for a staff member. She did so with Leona, who had nine years of hairdressing experience. To qualify, employers must also prove that they have searched for suitable applicants within Australia for a minimum of four weeks on approved platforms. The Department of Home Affairs requires employers to post advertisements on multiple job sites with a nationwide reach, including on the national Jobactive platform. ""We did have Australians apply but they didn't have the qualifications. They weren't suitable to fill the role,"" Ms Stillisano said. ""It is actually a three-year qualification in Australia to become a hairdresser. The only applicants who were qualified persons were from overseas."" But in March, her nomination for Leona was declined with a refusal letter from Home Affairs which said she had not tried hard enough to find an Australian worker. The process cost them both several thousand dollars and took more than 12 months. Ms Stillisano said it was well known that there were skills shortages, and hairdressers had been in the top 10 of the government's national skill shortage list of trades for 20 years. ""It just seems a little redundant that we have to actually prove to the government that we are struggling to find hairdressers when we're actually, in fact, very high up on the skill shortage list,"" she said. Ms Stillisano said many employers believed the requirement for labour market tests for industries on the national skill shortage list should be suspended. She said although the federal government did a lot last year to help with boosting apprentice numbers, it still took three years for them to qualify. ""There's going to be a further 18 months or so shortfall where businesses are struggling to hire staff,"" she said. Doris Dengel, a registered migration agent with ESS Worldwide, agreed that suspending the labour market test would be a good idea. ""I would think, certainly, temporarily suspending it would help,"" she said. ""It has, over time, become harder and harder, longer, more expensive. So it becomes a bit of an inflexible system for employers."" She said employers might have more success going through immigration agents such as herself. ""It certainly helps to, I think, cooperate with an immigration agent to avoid possible refusals because we do this on a daily basis,"" she said. ""We can certainly make sure — as much as we can, at least — we get a visa at the end and the worker can come over."" One permanent resident, Pamela, said that it took eight years and cost $80,000 for herself, a cleaner, and her stonemason husband to get through the process of becoming a permanent resident and migrant worker. ""The cost is on the potential worker, unable to claim government assistance while looking to contribute to our country,"" she said. ""We're coming here to work hard and pay taxes and to help. We're not here to steal your jobs."" Ms Stillisano was also keen to emphasise that the arrangements were not designed to take jobs permanently. ""The sponsorships are only for a short-term sponsorship, two years. So it's not like we're bringing overseas workers over to fill an Australian role for the next 10 to 20 years,"" she said. In response, the Department of Home Affairs said ""the government is committed to supporting the skills needs of businesses through access to overseas workers where Australian workers are not available"". The government regularly calibrates Temporary Skill Shortage visa settings to meet labour market needs. However, ""Labour Market Testing is a legislative requirement that must be satisfied before a Temporary Skilled Shortage (TSS) nomination can be approved."" With figures provided by the Department of Home Affairs, there were currently 94,600 TSS visa holders in Australia. The reasons for refusals and the rate of refusal were not available in current reporting.

125,"Former police officer calls for mental health overhaul, after three recent suicides",health,"  Former NT Police officer calls for an overhaul of mental health services following recent suicides Paul Milne finds it hard to shake off the time he came face to face with a saltwater crocodile during a dramatic police rescue in the Northern Territory. The former NT Police Sergeant was called to the Mary River in the Top End in 2013 to save a woman's life after her houseboat capsized in the croc-infested waters. ""At the time I just didn't think anything of it,"" he said. ""You do your job, you're robotic, you go numb, you don't worry about danger, you're trained."" Mr Milne remembers having to pull the woman's body out of the river in a tinny and moving it to the water's edge so paramedics and police could conduct CPR. Crocodiles were closing in on the group and Mr Milne said he had to act on his feet and fire his gun to keep the reptiles away. ""There were a lot of crocodiles coming up onto the bank and one came within half a metre of me, so I almost got taken,"" he said. The woman could not be saved, and as the weeks passed for Mr Milne, signs of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) started to surface. ""I went to Crocodylus Park one day with the kids and saw a crocodile and I flipped out,"" he said. ""It just spun me out, I just stopped in my tracks, and it knocked me for six."" His traumatic experience at Mary River didn't stop with just the crocodiles. Regular police call outs became harder for the police leader to manage, and he was struggling to turn up to work. ""One minute I'm driving a patrol car down the road in Palmerston, then my chest starts beating a million miles an hour going to a simple job,"" he said. ""I'm thinking to myself 'what is going on, this is normal for me, I can deal with this … I'm stronger than this."" But it was the Christmas-New Year period that year that Mr Milne said ""pushed him"" over the line and brought his decade-long career with NT Police to an end. He said his unit had a bad run, responding to ""eight deaths within eight weeks"". He said the impact took its toll on everyone. ""We were getting absolutely smashed,"" he said. ""Every shift, we would have a death, or go to a critical incident like a sexual assault, or a fatal."" In 2017, Mr Milne was medically retired from the force because of his PTSD and moved with his family to Victoria to access specialist mental health support that he could not get in the Northern Territory. Get a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by subscribing to our monthly newsletter From his home in the Dandenong Ranges, news of a ""cluster"" of suicide deaths involving Northern Territory police officers has hit Mr Milne hard. NT Police have confirmed two serving police officers and one retired member have died by suicide in the past three months. Mr Milne said he feels a mix of ""despair and devastation"" for the men he used to work with and is calling for cultural change to the way mental health is handled in the ranks. ""It is a major issue,"" he said. ""If three teachers had committed suicide it would be all over national news … what is going on, something needs to be done right now."" Mr Milne is not the first person to break ranks and speak out about mental health in the blue brigade. Ex-Northern Territory police officers are speaking out about mental health issues in the force and say there's inadequate resources available to help them cope. ABC Radio Darwin has interviewed several current and former members about the issue, with some remaining anonymous out of fear of losing their jobs. Acting Police Commissioner Michael Murphy said the deaths have ""rocked the police force"". ""Policing is a tough gig, we see things, people see things that you can't unsee ... it basically challenges your understanding of human nature,"" he told ABC Radio Darwin. Acting Commissioner Murphy said an independent review into the health and wellbeing of services provided by NT Police had finished, with the findings to be discussed with the Northern Territory Police Association (NTPA). In a statement, the association's president, Paul McCue, said there was an ""overwhelming need for an overhaul of services"" for members of the force. ""Our members have faced an extremely challenging two year period being pushed to the limit during the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent resourcing pressures,"" the statement reads. Mr Milne remembers what it was like facing a mental health crisis and trying to ""keep face"" at work. He said he was treated differently by some colleagues when word of his PTSD got out, which he said added to his feelings of isolation. ""There is a definite stigma about it,"" he said. ""It was like, 'Oh no, he's on workers comp, he's probably faking it, he's a faker, he hasn't got a real condition, we can't see it, he's faking it', that's how it's seen."" The 48-year-old is calling for a re-think of the way mental health is handled in the force and said officers need regular support, during and after, their careers. ""We don't talk about it, we'll have a few beers and then we do that every week and there's a pattern where we just numb it, we just numb the trauma every week,"" he said. ""We do that for year on year and that just builds up and suddenly it'll just pop."" Acting Commissioner Michael Murphy said work needs to be done to ""shake the stigma attached to mental health"", so officers feel comfortable to come forward. ""They can come to me directly .... they won't lose their jobs, we'll offer them all the support they can (get),"" Commissioner Murphy said. Mr Milne is now a stay-at-home father to his four children and said his schedule is tight between meeting their needs and his own, to stay healthy. He wants his former colleagues in the Northern Territory to know that PTSD 'can creep up' and to seek help if they need it. ""You're not alone, if you need to talk to someone, please do, we are all here together, even though it doesn't feel like it sometimes and never give up,"" he said. ""If I can be a part of the change, well so be it, I'll be a part of it, I'm ready to help.""

126,One in three people are infected with this parasite – and the clue could be in your eyes,health,"  One in three people are infected with Toxoplasma parasite – and the clue could be in our eyes Toxoplasma gondii is probably the most successful parasite in the world today. This microscopic creature is capable of infecting any mammal or bird, and people across all continents are infected. Once infected, a person carries Toxoplasma for life. So far, we don't have a drug that can eradicate the parasite from the body. And there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. Across the world, it's estimated 30–50 per cent of people are infected with Toxoplasma — and infections may be increasing in Australia. A survey of studies conducted at blood banks and pregnancy clinics across the country in the 1970s put the infection rate at 30 per cent. However, a recent Western Australian community-based study found 66 per cent of people were infected. The disease caused by this parasite can scar the back of the eye. Our new research looked for signs of disease in otherwise healthy people and found a significant number bore the mark of Toxoplasma. The cat is the primary host for Toxoplasma. Cats catch the parasite when they eat infected prey. Then, for a couple of weeks, they pass large numbers of parasites in their faeces in a form that can survive for long periods in the environment, even during extreme weather. When the faeces are ingested by livestock while grazing, parasites lodge in the muscle and survive there after the animals are slaughtered for meat. Humans can become infected by eating this meat, or by eating fresh produce or drinking water soiled by cats. It is also possible for a woman infected for the first time during pregnancy to pass the infection to her unborn child. While infection with Toxoplasma is extremely common, the most important health statistic is the rate of the disease caused by the infection, which is called toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma really likes the retina, the multi-layered nerve tissue that lines the eye and generates vision. Infection can cause recurring attacks of retinal inflammation and permanent retinal scarring. This is known as ocular toxoplasmosis. Contrary to much that is written about ocular toxoplasmosis, medical research shows this condition usually affects healthy adults. However, in aged persons or people with a weakened immune system, or when contracted during pregnancy, it can be more severe. An attack of active inflammation causes ""floaters"" and blurred vision. When the inflammation progresses to scarring, there may be permanent loss of vision. In a study of patients with ocular toxoplasmosis seen at a large ophthalmology clinic, we measured reduced vision to below driving level in more than 50 per cent of eyes, and 25 per cent of eyes were irreversibly blind. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are quite familiar with managing ocular toxoplasmosis. But the extent of the problem is not widely recognised, even by the medical community. The number of Australians with ocular toxoplasmosis had never been measured, until now. We wanted to investigate the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in Australia, but we knew it would be challenging to get funding for a major survey of this neglected disease. So, we used information collected for a different purpose: as part of the Busselton Healthy Ageing Study, retinal photographs were taken from more than 5,000 baby boomers (born 1946–64) living in Busselton, Western Australia. The photographs were gathered to look for other eye diseases, macular degeneration and glaucoma. By screening these retinal photographs, we estimated the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis at one in 150 Australians. This might seem surprisingly common, but it fits with the way people catch Toxoplasma. In addition to pet cats, Australia has huge populations of feral cats. And Australia is home to a lot of farmland, including over 50 per cent of the global organic farming area. Most importantly, many Australians like to eat their red meat rare, putting them at real risk. To diagnose ocular toxoplasmosis, a retina examination is necessary, ideally with the pupils dilated. The retinal lesion is easy to spot, because of the way Toxoplasma activates retinal cells to produce certain proteins, and an ophthalmologist or optometrist can immediately recognise the appearance. Often a blood test is also performed to make the diagnosis. If the condition is mild, the doctor may let the body's own immune system control the problem, which takes a few months. However, usually a combination of anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic drugs is prescribed. Toxoplasma infection is not curable, but it can be prevented. Meat sold in Australian supermarkets may harbour Toxoplasma. Cooking meat to an internal temperature of 66C or freezing it ahead of cooking are ways to kill the parasite. Fresh fruit and vegetables should be washed before eating, and drinking untreated water (such as straight from rivers or creeks) should be avoided. Gloves should be worn when changing cat litter, and hands washed afterwards. The World Health Organisation and other international and national health bodies are promoting an approach called One Health for diseases that cross humans, animals and their environments. This involves different sectors working together to promote good health. Now we know just how common ocular toxoplasmosis is in Australia, there is real justification to harness One Health to combat Toxoplasma infections in this country. Justine R. Smith is a professor of eye and vision health at Flinders University. Joao M. Furtado is an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Universidade de Sao Paulo.

127,'A lot of biblical events tend to happen': Sperm donor secrecy sees records unnecessarily withheld,health,"  Sperm-donor-conceived Queenslanders turn to DNA databases to track down biological fathers After years of desperately searching for their sperm-donor fathers, Queenslanders Kate Drysdale and Kerri Favarato used an ancestry DNA database and turned detective to find them. But as a Queensland Parliamentary committee prepares to investigate law reform around donor conception, both women hope the journey for others in their position — those conceived when sperm donation was cloaked in secrecy — is not as fraught. The women were conceived in different decades but with help from the same Brisbane fertility clinic. During multiple contacts with the clinic to request information about their biological fathers, they were separately told by different people at different times medical records may have been damaged by smoke and floods, or lost, or destroyed. ""A lot of Biblical events tend to happen within the record departments of fertility clinics,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""I don't mean to be facetious but so many donor-conceived people have been told that."" Having children of their own has intensified their desire to learn more about their biological heritage. Both women turned to science — and an American direct-to-consumer DNA testing company and database — to continue the search. So-called ancestry databases allow people to compare their own DNA against other publicly available genetic profiles to help them find blood relatives and to build a family tree. In the cases of Ms Drysdale, 30, and Ms Favarato, 39, it allowed them to identify their biological fathers even though neither man had registered a DNA sample on a consumer database at that time. Soon after giving birth to her daughter, Brisbane-based Ms Favarato spent five months of painstaking work piecing together her family tree after finding on a database a fourth cousin — a woman she shared great, great, great grandparents with. ""It was exhausting and really hard work but I needed it to be done,"" she said. ""I was so sick of going through the process of trying to find information and getting the door slammed in my face. ""I just went: 'This is my chance, I have to do this'."" By this stage, Ms Favarato had already spent about two decades looking. As a teenager, after learning her biological father had probably been a medical student, Ms Favarato accessed University of Queensland medical graduate records for the relevant years of the 1980s, making a list of potential candidates. ""I crossed out anyone that had an Asian or Indian sounding name and I crossed out all of the females,"" she said. ""Then I started writing letters to doctors, going: 'Are you my donor?'."" It came to nought. Years later, in February 2017, through DNA searches for blood relatives and hundreds of hours of detective work to develop her family tree, she finally had a match to a Brisbane doctor — Donald 'Digger' Whittaker. Impatient to speak to him, rather than write an email, she picked up the phone and dialled his clinic, leaving a message for him to return her call about ""a private family matter"". Within minutes, he called back. ""How do I know you?"" Dr Whittaker asked. ""Did you donate sperm in the 80s? I think you're my biological father,"" Ms Favarato replied. ""Oh my goodness. Hello darling. How are you? Tell me about yourself,"" Dr Whittaker answered. Five years on, they have what Ms Favarato describes as an ""undefinable"" relationship with ""reasonably regular"" contact. They visit each other's homes and she introduces him to people as ""my biological father"". ""He doesn't call me his daughter or anything like that,"" Ms Favarato said. ""We don't have the same relationship that I have with the dad who raised me. It's not like that, but it's an undeniable connection. ""We just don't bother labelling anything. It is what it is."" Kate Drysdale, who lives in Atherton, in Queensland's far north, with partner Andrew and their young son, has known she was donor-conceived since the age of seven. By then, her mother Carol and her non-biological father had divorced and he was no longer in their lives. ""My legal father and my mother disagreed as to whether or not I should be told. She'd always wanted me to know,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""She has a social work background. She understood the importance of knowing one's identity."" Before having her own child, Ms Drysdale had ""essentially given up"" on the idea of ever finding her biological father, given he had donated his sperm anonymously in the 1990s. She grew up knowing only that he had brown hair and green eyes and was a university student, based on information her mother had been provided by the clinic. But Ms Drysdale's desire to learn more about her genetic background grew after she gave birth to a son five years ago. Her son was still a baby when a television news story on donor conception triggered a renewed interest in her origins. With the support of her mother and after repeated phone calls and emails to the fertility clinic, she was able to obtain scant details about her biological father. Ms Drysdale's biological father had been a humanities student, his blood type was O-positive, he had three brothers and he was 21 years old at the time of his donation. After continuing to ""harass"" the clinic, she also learned of at least one donor-conceived half sibling, but the clinic could not tell her a gender or a birth date. ""Parents were not required to inform clinics whether the procedures had been successful and resulted in a child,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""Even if they had been recording information correctly, they weren't being provided it."" Finding contact with the fertility clinic tortuous, Ms Drysdale had her DNA tested and her genetic profile uploaded onto an online database. A couple of matches with distant cousins, including a 100-year-old woman living in Brisbane, who had already built an ""extensive family tree"", and another living in the United Kingdom, allowed her to trace her biological father's identity, using the small amount of information she was able to glean from the fertility clinic. It took her just three weeks. ""To be honest … If you get the matches through the DNA testing, it's not that hard to work out who the donor is,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""I knew nothing when I started."" As she contemplated her next step, the fertility clinic contacted her unexpectedly, telling her they had managed to track down her biological father and would organise mandatory counselling sessions before a potential meeting. Although she already knew his name, and how to contact him, Ms Drysdale chose to go down the clinic path fearing he may view being approached directly as ""disrespectful or invasive"". It would take a year before she finally had email contact with him and about two years before they finally met in Atherton in late 2020 along with his wife and their two children. ""The first question his wife asked me was: 'Do you have an overlapping tooth, too?',"" Ms Drysdale recalled. ""And I do. ""I always thought I looked like my mother until I met that man. He is the male version of me, just 21 years older."" Ms Drysdale and her biological father are both employed in the social science field, but more important to her is his personality. ""I had a negative view of what a father was growing up,"" she said. ""It's just really nice to find out that he is a positive, empathetic, kind human being that thinks about the world and wants to have a positive influence on it. ""So it's nice that that's the personality that I come from."" Meeting her biological father took years of trauma and heartache. The distress was only compounded when he told her he had given his details to the fertility clinic years earlier, making it clear he was open to contact, before she began her search for him. ""They either had no record of that, or … they just didn't bother to say anything,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""The clinic should have been able to simply consult their records, advise that he was open to contact and connect us. ""Instead, I experienced many months living in a state of near panic that I would not get any information or would ultimately be rejected by the person I had been searching for for so long."" Ms Drysdale is one of about 70 people who have made submissions to the Queensland parliament's Legal Affairs and Safety Committee's inquiry into matters relating to donor conception information, which will hear evidence on Friday. Her detailed 11-page submission calls for the establishment of a donor conception register, mandating clinics to provide ""full and accurate"" information in a timely manner, with penalties for non-compliance. She wants all donor-conceived people to also be able to access identifying information relating to donors and donor-conceived siblings, regardless of when they were conceived. Ms Drysdale would also like to see the birth certificates of donor-conceived people include a notation indicating they are donor conceived, with contact details for how to access further information. Given that some people source donor sperm, eggs or embryos from overseas, she is also calling for a ban on the importation of reproductive tissue if the international clinics involved cannot be held to Queensland standards. Her calls echo those of Donor Conceived Australia (DCA), an advocacy and support group for people conceived via assisted reproductive treatments, which has more than 500 members. DCA's 27-page submission to the parliamentary inquiry requests opt-in counselling for donor-conceived individuals, donors and their families as ""an essential aspect of managing information relating to donor conception"". ""Currently, there are no Queensland-based counselling services providing specialised support in the donor-conception sphere,"" the submission stated. It called for counselling to be provided by professionals not involved or affiliated with the fertility industry to ensure confidence they are ""independent, objective and focused on the interests of that client"". We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. DCA director Aimee Shackleton said her Queensland members often reported seeking help from local psychologists with ""absolutely no idea"" how to support them through the complex issues involved with donor conception. ""Donor Conceived Australia is hoping to be involved in creating competency-based accreditation courses for mental health professionals and calls for government-funded counselling to support donor-conceived people when they need it most,"" she said. Ms Shackleton said donor-conceived adults often turned to her organisation after years of searching for donors and after frequently being turned away by fertility clinics. ""They find there are no government agencies to help them,"" she said. ""They often realise they need to spend hundreds of dollars to send their genetic material to an American-based DNA company. ""Many also turn to paying professional genealogists or private investigators to do the work for them."" Since Kerri Favarato found her biological father, with her encouragement, Dr Whittaker has also supplied his own DNA profile to the same database that helped her find him. That resulted in Ms Favarato discovering six donor-conceived half siblings, all of them previously unaware they were conceived using donor sperm. ""Two of them I speak with very regularly. We've become almost like very close friends. We speak quite often,"" Ms Favarato said. As a young medical student, Dr Whittaker donated sperm two or three times a week for five years. It's impossible to know how many children he may have fathered, leaving Ms Favarato concerned about the unknown number of cousins her own children may have and the future potential for them to end up in a relationship with one of them. ""I have a nine-year-old and a five-year-old. They've got lots of cousins floating around,"" she said. ""When you talk about the numbers, it could be anywhere from 30 to 300, maybe more than that. Who knows? We don't know for sure. We'll never know. ""That's [lots of] first cousins running around that they have the potential to have relationships with."" Queensland fertility clinics are subject to National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines, which have required since September 2004 that donations of sperm, eggs and embryos can only take place if donors first consent to their information being made available, on request, once any conceived children turn 18. Under the guidelines, clinics must also take all reasonable steps to reduce the numbers of genetic relatives created through their donor programs. The Fertility Society of Australia's reproductive technology accreditation committee advises that ""a maximum of 10 donor families"" per sperm donor is acceptable, regardless of where those families are. University of Western Sydney law professor Sonia Allan, who has been studying legal issues surrounding donor conception for 20 years, described the accreditation committee system as ""self regulatory"". ""It is important to recognise that while advice or guidelines play an important role in setting standards, they do not have the force of the law,"" Professor Allan said. ""You should have the law behind it. What happens is that if it doesn't have legal force, the risk is, and this is certainly a risk in Queensland, that you have individuals or clinics who don't follow the guidance, as there is no enforceable obligation to do so. ""That can result in people having many more donor-conceived siblings than perhaps they should. ""Combined with a lack of information about their donor-conceived status and/or their biological relatives, this leads to an increased chance of them forming relationships with each other, meaning sexual relationships, because they don't know who their first-degree relatives are. ""You also create a situation where donor-conceived people live in fear or constant uncertainty. The impact on some people's lives is really unacceptable."" The Queensland parliamentary committee is due to hand down its report on donor conception law reform in August. As she awaits the outcome, Kate Drysdale will continue to build a relationship with her biological father. ""We will never have a father-daughter relationship because you can't get back 30 years of history,"" she said. ""I talk to him probably every couple of weeks on the phone, we update each other about what's happening in our lives. I see him as a friend."" Ms Drysdale's hopeful things will be different for her son — her biological father's first grandchild.

128,How can you vote when you're trapped in overseas COVID lockdowns?,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes 阅读中文版本 Joanne Wood, an Australian banker who has lived in Shanghai for nearly two decades, has been watching the Australian federal election closely for months. Keeping up with election news and talking about it with her Australian friends and family has helped her feel less lonely and more connected during Shanghai's strict lockdown. So finding out that it was going to be practically impossible to vote this month was ""a huge disappointment"". ""I'm proud to be Australian. I feel fortunate that I was born Australian [and] that my voice can be heard and is welcomed,"" Ms Wood told the ABC. ""To lose that opportunity is something that makes me sad. It's disappointing."" Shanghai has been under a city-wide lockdown for more than a month, which has led to massive delivery delays and food shortages, and the government has given no indication of when it will be lifted. The Australian Consulate-General in Shanghai, where Australians would normally be able to vote in person, has been closed since April. On May 6, the Consulate-General advised on WeChat that Australians in the city should fill out an overseas notification form, which ""confirms the voter is unable to vote due to being overseas"". Australia and New Zealand have given up on trying to eliminate COVID-19, but China still refuses to learn to live with the virus. Here's why. Those who still wanted to vote would have to register for a postal ballot, which the Australian Election Commission (AEC) would send from Australia via its ""point-to-point courier delivery solution"". Voters would then have to return the completed ballot to the AEC or other Australian missions in China. Ms Wood said she did not think this would work. ""Your courier can't even deliver to your residential compound the basic groceries, [like] food and drinking water,"" she said. ""How on earth are you going to get voting papers from Australia to here? ""They [AEC] may be able to get them in to China, but could they get them to your door with all of the different checkpoints we have for COVID? I just didn't see that the timing would work. ""Even if you did manage to get it through international courier in time, filled it in, getting it back out into Australia in time was going to be as much of an issue."" ""Understanding that, I just took what I felt to be the easiest path of least resistance,"" she said, by filling out a form indicating she would be unable to vote. At the 2019 federal election, 9,177 votes were cast in-person in China, including 5,428 votes cast in Hong Kong. The AEC also sent out 3,768 postal votes to Australians in mainland China, including 1,728 in Shanghai. Tina Lan, another Australian citizen in Shanghai, said she did not believe it would be possible for her to vote either, even if there was time for the papers to go from Australia to China and back again. The AEC can accept ballot papers up to 13 days following election day. Ms Lan and her family were released from one of the city's quarantine facilities just last week and they are still required to remain at home. They were not even allowed to pick up mail or delivered items. ""I can't even get out of my apartment now as I am in this seven-day home isolation. It is impossible to mail [the ballot],"" she said. “Everything makes me feel like it is impossible to vote in this election."" She added that she was confused about the voting rules. ""No-one comes to tell you which day you need to send a letter and how far in advance you need to send it,"" she said. ""There is no way to even estimate how much time these things would take at the moment."" Shanghai authorities may be loosening the city's COVID lockdown, but after weeks of uncertainty, foreign workers are considering leaving. An AEC spokesperson said there was not much more they could do to facilitate postal voting if the compounds were restricted from receiving mail and courier deliveries. ""Information about the federal election and participating in the election is being distributed by consulates, through the AEC's website and social media channels and via an advertising campaign,"" the spokesperson said. ""If digital channels are restricted by a foreign country to the extent where this information is restricted, and postal services are also restricted, there is again not many, if any, other avenues available."" The spokesperson added that voting was not compulsory for Australians overseas, so anyone who missed the deadline would not be penalised. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they were ""continuing to encourage Australians in China who have not already done so to register for a postal vote"". That included Australians planning to vote in person in Beijing and Guangzhou — where Australia has an embassy and consulate — ""in case this option becomes unavailable at short notice"". Simon Lance, a Western Australian businessman who has lived in Shanghai for more than 10 years, decided it was worth registering for a postal vote. He received confirmation from Australia Post that his voting package was on its way on May 7. Mr Lance told the ABC that residents in his compound were due to be able to receive some deliveries starting today, but he was not sure if Australia Post deliveries would get through. ""That's obviously a key component of it,"" he said. Yee-Fui Ng, deputy director of the Australian Centre for Justice Innovation at Monash University, said overseas voters were an essential part of the Australian community and including them in elections was critical. ""There is a balance between a public health crisis and exercising a fundamental democratic right,"" said Dr Ng, who will also vote overseas while visiting the United States. ""It's better to keep Australian citizens engaged in our democratic processes — wherever they are. ""I think the AEC should facilitate voting as much as possible, within the constraints of the public health emergency."" Chiara De Lazzari, a research fellow from the School of Social Sciences at Monash University, told the ABC that countries like Australia that allow overseas citizens to vote in the national elections ""should also be responsible to maintain a form of connection with those citizens"". However, she acknowledged that given the current circumstances, Australia lacked the capacity to ""evaluate the situation in each and every place where residents live"". ""For instance, Shanghai is one of the few places in lockdown while most people around the world are conducting a semi-normal life with very limited restrictions,"" she said. ""This causes significant challenges for countries that want to ensure citizens' participation from abroad."" Dr De Lazzari said an online system would make voting easier for overseas Australians. ""In the future, we should hope for the establishment of some form of electronic voting that will overcome all the logistic issues caused by the pandemic, in the circumstances in which people live in remote areas, or just to facilitate the voting process from abroad,"" she said. While online voting could be a potential option, Dr Ng warned it could be vulnerable to software manipulation, identity fraud, data breaches or information theft. So far, the only country in the world that permits electronic voting is Estonia, where voters can cast their ballots in local, national and European elections online with their personal digital devices. 阅读中文版本 How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' See our full coverage of coronavirus We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

129,"A question weighed heavily on Gabriel when he was 18. When asked, his doctor said he'd be blind by age 40",health,"  Gabriel will be blind by the time he's 40. But his vision for his community is 'crystal clear' When Gabriel Gervasoni was born, he was so pale that the nuns at the old Catholic hospital in Ballarat thought ""he must be an angel"", his mother, Mandy, quips. ""He had this bright white hair,"" she says. ""People keep commenting, 'He's so alert, he's looking at everything'. I thought, 'his eyes are moving a lot', but I didn't have a lot of experience with babies."" Though hitting the expected milestones, as the weeks passed, Mandy began to notice that when Gabriel would look at people, ""he was really only looking at the direction the sound was coming from"". The doctor tried to reassure her. He's just maturing late, they told her. ""Some babies do that."" But Mandy ""had an instinct"". She was referred to a paediatrician for a second opinion — a decision that would herald a two-decade search for answers. ""I was given multiple diagnoses over the years, like Leber's congenital amaurosis, retinitis pigmentosa, albinism,"" says Gabriel, who is legally blind and has a reduced field of vision. ""It's stressful and frustrating not having answers."" Having spent much of his life in diagnostic purgatory, as Gabriel entered adulthood a question began to weigh on him. It was obvious that ""something was concerning him"", Mandy says, and when Gabriel was about 18 years old, he asked his childhood ophthalmologist point-blank: ""Am I going to go blind?"" ""He said, 'Yes, you'll be blind by the time you're 40',"" Gabriel says. It's a difficult prospect to contemplate, but a path the duo have navigated once before. After visiting the paediatrician all those years ago, Gabriel, still just a newborn, was referred to one of the top ophthalmologists in Victoria, who conducted a series of tests. ""They played lights, they're similar to strobe lights, as though you're in a nightclub,"" Mandy says. ""He didn't even wake up. He just sat there with his little head in the machine with me holding him up."" She was told that Gabriel had no light recognition, meaning he ""couldn't tell if it was light or dark"", and wouldn't be able to see But as he grew older, something happened: he started to gain limited vision. At six months, he turned his head towards a window, something he'd never done before. A year later, he started ""being really hesitant"". ""He'd be walking along, and then all of a sudden he'd go, 'Oh',"" Mandy says. ""He was actually getting his navigational vision, so he was actually being able to see blurry shapes, which was terrifying for him because he'd never experienced that before."" Though life through Gabriel's lens is ""very blurry"", his photo reel is a treasure trove of memories, and a celebration of the everyday. There's the duck he saw in the park one morning, and the ""huge cat"" that walked past him. ""It makes me realise how fleeting things are,"" he says of his journey. ""I want to memorise that while I've still got vision."" The official term for his ""current diagnosis"" is an ill-defined form of retinal dystrophy. In layman's terms, it means Gabriel's vision will ""gradually go away"" and he'll be ""completely blind"" by the time he's 40. But while Gabriel found himself in ""complete shock by the 180 (degree change)"" in his development, it would ultimately only further fuel his passion to help ""others with a disability to lead fulfilling lives"". If you are aged between 16 and 22 and would like to find out more about the ABC Heywire Competition, go to the ABC Heywire website. More than 575,000 Australians are blind or vision impaired. And as a young person with a disability, Gabriel knows all too well the extra hurdles employment, education and even social activities can bring. ""I realised when I was young, being vision impaired, I wouldn't have as many opportunities as someone with full vision,"" he says. ""So I decided that I'll do as much as I can to support the community and to raise awareness for people with vision impairment and disabilities in general."" Determined to be a voice for those often left out of the conversation, he joined the City of Ballarat's Youth Council and the Central Highlands Youth Advisory Board to ensure the needs of young people were being heard. ""He's become a fantastic role model for many of our other youth volunteers because nothing can stop him,"" says Katja Fiedler, a youth development officer with the City of Ballarat. ""On some of our leadership camps, we've gone out bush and done kayaking or we're jumping off things, and Gabe's always the first to put his hand up to do something he's never done before."" The youth council brings together young people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, experiences and abilities, who ""provide insights that we might not get from internal discussions or consultations within council"", Katja says. Through his lived experience, Gabriel has helped shape the city's health and wellbeing plan, and provided important input into local master plans and redevelopment projects. ""It's really, really important to get his insights as a young person who's visually impaired, especially when it comes to accessibility but also refurbishing,"" Katja says. ""What could or should a space look like to make it inclusive, accessible, enjoyable and accommodating for young people with vision impairment but also other disabilities?"" Accessibility challenges are often something people don't consider, echoes Mandy, who has seen Gabriel go through a ""really big orientation process"". His reduced field of vision means ""all of his peripheral vision is gone"" — something they ""couldn't plan for"". But for Mandy — who has watched her son not just adapt to life's challenges, but grow as a person — there was never any question over whether his diagnosis would quell his passion. ""We all have challenges to face and this was his challenge,"" she says. ""He's pretty exceptional. I know that every mother says that, but he really is,"" she laughs. Evidently, it's not just his mum who thinks so. Gabriel was named Ballarat's Young Citizen of the Year for 2021, with judges pointing to his ""determination to contribute to the Ballarat community"" and passion about ""issues affecting youth and those with disabilities"". While those living with a disability face barriers across the board, regional communities must navigate unique challenges, including significantly reduced access to options and choices about services to support their needs. Gabriel wants to use his platform to ensure decision-makers ""embrace accessibility as a priority and to ensure that there are no barriers to people with disability being part of our community"". ""Making sure people have access to employment, education, community spaces and social activities, that's very important to me,"" he says. It's a belief shared by Sally Aurisch, CEO of Blind Citizens Australia, the national representative organisation of people who are blind or vision impaired. While ""accessibility on a spectrum is not too bad"" in Australia, she says, ""we do still have our fair share of challenges"". ""A story I heard recently from someone was that they lived in a very small town with one bus driver, it was a very long trip, so it was hard to gauge, and that driver didn't mention to this person when their stop was approaching,"" she says. ""But this person never felt confident to provide feedback to this to the service provider because they were the only blind person in town, so it was going to be very easy to identify who they were."" It's why ensuring those who live with a disability have a seat at the table is so important, she says. ""I think that disability and life experience, in general, affects us all differently, our needs are quite unique and diverse,"" she says. ""And so by bringing together a variety of voices, when we design services and programs, we can make sure that they meet that diverse group of needs."" Soft-spoken and humble, Gabriel hesitates to speak about his achievements. Thankfully, that's what mums are for. ""We put in a cabinet to put his awards in and now he's taken up the whole thing,"" Mandy laughs. ""He can't win any more awards because I can't fit them in. ""He feels like it's a real honour, but he's embarrassed about it, because to him, it's just like, 'That's just what you do mum. If you see a need, you fill that need, you help that person'."" As she watches her son continue to ""exceed the expectations"", as he has in the face of all of life's hurdles, Mandy has high hopes for her regional community. She longs for the day when there are no barriers to employment, education and social activities; when Gabriel can be ""just another face in the crowd"". ""Without there needing to be special adaptations, because those adaptations are automatically built-in,"" she says. ""I just hope that he feels able to do whatever he wants to do; that whatever his dreams and his passion is in life, that he can do that."" As Gabriel's diagnosis stands, he has another 20 years of sight — and he's determined to make the most of it. You'll find the 21-year-old walking around town ""looking at everything"" in his path. ""People who can see might walk past certain things without really noticing it, because they've probably walked past it a million times and will pass it another million times,"" he says. ""But for me, I walk past it and I don't know if it's going to be the last time I see it or not. I want to imprint everything that I see so I can appreciate it.""

130,Former Australian of Year says Liberal MP selectively quoted him in surprise endorsement advertisement,health,"  A former Australian of the Year and mental health advocate says Liberal MP Fiona Martin's campaign has selectively quoted him in a re-election endorsement for her without his knowledge. Patrick McGorry, the executive director of Orygen and professor of youth mental health at the University of Melbourne, has asked the Member for Reid to take down a digital ad in which he was featured. Professor McGorry told the ABC he was ""very concerned"" by the ads, targeted at young adults under 35 years old, published across Facebook and Instagram. ""I've called her to say I'm extremely concerned ... that my image and supportive comments have been used in the election campaign,"" he said. ""This was done without my knowledge and the authorisation and I've asked her to remove that from her election material."" Dr Martin told the ABC she had agreed to this request. Professor McGorry said he sent Dr Martin an email in March, before the election was called to thank her for chairing a parliamentary inquiry into mental health which was tabled at the end of last year. Dr Martin's ad, which also spruiked her involvement in mental health services, used only the first and last sentence of the 214-word email he sent her. ""Dear Fiona, I wanted to thank you for your committed and effective advocacy for investment and reform in mental health care,"" the ad read over an image of Professor McGorry. ""You have been a tireless leader and advocate for mental health not only nationally but also in your own Community. I hope your efforts are successful."" The below is the full email Patrick McGorry sent Fiona Martin on March 22, which he has given the ABC permission to publish. The bolded sections are words which were used in Dr Martin's ads. Dear Fiona I wanted to thank you for your committed and effective advocacy for investment and reform in mental health care.  The parliamentary inquiry you chaired on mental health, in collaboration with Emma McBride  from the ALP, was a key bipartisan process which has moved things forward in several important ways. Your professional background as a psychologist proved invaluable and is a unique asset for the field within the current parliament.  As you know, I led the advocacy alongside Angus Cleland of Mental Health Victoria which led to the creation and funding of the adult mental health hub model. Now branded as “Head to Health” Centres – these are being scaled up nationally, again with bipartisan support as has occurred with headspace.   I am delighted that you have been advocating strongly to have one of these key platforms of care in your own electorate.  These hubs are essential backup systems of care for GPs and psychologists for the “missing middle” – those Australians with more complex and sustained mental health conditions for which primary care is simply insufficient on its own.  In this and many other ways you have been a tireless leader and advocate for mental health not only nationally but also in your own community. I hope your efforts are successful. Kind regards Pat McGorry Professor McGorry said the quotes were selectively taken from his email, that he did not consent to it being published, and the ad could compromise his advocacy work. ""I've been absolutely strict over many years about a bipartisan approach to mental health ... so I'm very surprised to hear that information,"" Professor McGorry said. ""It seems to be implied in that statement that I'm basically advocating people vote for her, and I certainly never would have said that."" Dr Martin, in a statement to the ABC, said she had spoke to Professor McGorry and would remove the advertising. ""I have enormous respect for Professor Patrick McGorry,"" she said. ""We have been able to work closely together to achieve important outcomes in mental health and suicide prevention. Earlier this year, I asked Pat for words of endorsement that he had kindly provided, and unfortunately there was a misunderstanding about how those words would be used. ""We have spoken today, and I offered to rectify this misunderstanding by removing the advertising, which he has accepted."" The electorate is crucial for the Liberal Party in this election, and Dr Martin, who holds the Western Sydney seat by a 3.2 per cent margin, is trying to withstand a challenge from Labor candidate Sally Sitou. It is the second time in less than a day Dr Martin has come under the spotlight while on the campaign trail. Her Labor opponent Ms Sitou, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, has accused Dr Martin of confusing her for another Asian-Australian during a heated debate on 2GB. The Coalition has faced a barrage of criticism for featuring prominent charity figures and community leaders on endorsement materials without their knowledge or permission. News Corp on Wednesday reported that Ryan MP Julian Simmonds had distributed what purported to be a personal endorsement from a priest without authorisation. The Guardian reported that The Pyjama Foundation and Access Arts both demanded Brisbane MP Trevor Evans stop distributing material that appeared to offer him their endorsements.

131,Annual camp at Bear Cottage children's hospice provides a safe space for the 'forgotten mourners',health,"  Annual camp at Bear Cottage children's hospice provides a safe space for the 'forgotten mourners' Every year, a small group of grandparents gather together on the northern side of Sydney Harbour for a camp that honours the grandparenting role in family life. Unlike typical celebrations of childhood, the families at this gathering all have a common connection to Bear Cottage, a children's hospice based in Manly. Bear Cottage's registered art therapist, Judy King, has facilitated the camp since 2016 and said grandparents were often the ""forgotten mourners"" when a child had a life-limiting illness. ""We were noticing how important grandparents were in the scheme of things,"" she said. ""And there was a lot of support for mums, the dads, for siblings, and it's almost like the grandparents are the forgotten mourners. ""There's an extra level of grief for them. ""They're grieving for what their son or daughter is going through, and for their grandchild."" Bear Cottage will turn 21 this year. It is the only children's hospice in New South Wales and is part of the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network. It offers end-of-life and respite services for children who are very ill, as well as ongoing support to families. Ms King said it was often grandparents who rose to the challenge of looking after siblings and caring for a sick child and their parents. ""There's not always a lot of support for them. There is a generational thing of 'We just get on with it',"" she said. ""They don't always reach out. ""They look after everybody else and do not always look after themselves. And so we really try to provide a space where they can share."" Grandparent Don Wheeler and his wife Christine moved to Sydney from Brisbane when their grandson Levi was diagnosed with a brain tumour and given nine to 12 months to live. ""I think we just wanted to be here to do as much for Ben and Kath [Levi's parents] as we could,"" he said. Levi passed away at Bear Cottage on New Year's Eve in 2018. The family has channelled its energies into Levi's Project, which raises funds for research into the rare brain tumour Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). Mr Wheeler said the family talks about Levi every day to keep his memory alive. ""Grief is something that you'll never get over. It will always be there,"" he said. Joanne Gallen is the grandmother of 10-year-old Xavier — who has a number of ongoing medical challenges and uses Bear Cottage regularly for respite — and has now been to three of the camps. ""You can say things that you can't say to your children and you share things that you think are very dark, but it's really hard to open up with other people that don't understand what you're going through,"" she said. Ms Gallen said the medical support at the cottage allowed the family to simply enjoy Xavier and their other children. ""It's a place where the family can relax and have time out from the hard caring of a palliative care child. They're fantastic,"" she said. The camp is an opportunity for grandparents to take some of the load off, according to Ms King. ""I often see grandparents be really brave and stoic, and because they just want to support their child, and they want to support their grandchild and the other grandchildren,"" she said. ""There's sometimes some guilt … there's sometimes some anger, although that's not usually shown. ""This is the space where we allow that."" Watch this story on 7.30 on ABC TV and ABC iview.

132,Charge of intimidating witness dropped against Integrity Care director connected with Ann Marie Smith's death,health,"  Charge of intimidating witness dropped against Integrity Care director Philip Greenland in connection with Ann Marie Smith's death Police have dropped charges against a former director of NDIS provider Integrity Care for threatening a key witness in an investigation into the death of Adelaide woman Ann Marie Smith. Prosecutors in the Adelaide Magistrates Court formally withdrew the charge against Philip John Greenland, saying they would no longer pursue the allegation. Police are still proceeding with an aggravated assault charge against the 57-year-old Huntfield Heights man after he allegedly spat in the witness's face at a service station last year. Ms Smith died in April 2020 from severe septic shock, malnutrition, multiple organ failure and other complications from her cerebral palsy while she was in full-time care. Police believe she was confined to a cane chair inside her Kensington Park home for 24 hours a day in the year leading up to her death. The 54-year-old lived alone and relied on an Integrity Care support worker for all of her needs. That carer, Rosa Maria Maione, is now behind bars, after she pleaded guilty in July last year to Ms Smith's manslaughter. Maione's former employer, Integrity Care SA, was fined more than $12,000 by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission for failing to report Ms Smith's death. The Quality and Safeguards Commission is also taking separate civil action against the company. Mr Greenland's matter will be referred to the Christies Beach Magistrates Court in July.

133,"SA records COVID case surge, flu rates highest in young people",health,"  South Australia has recorded a surge in new COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations, while eight people who tested positive have died. Those who died include a man in his sixties, two men in their seventies, a woman in her eighties, a man and two women in their nineties and a woman aged over 100. The state recorded 4,299 new cases, the highest daily total since April 27. The jump in cases coincided with a 24 per cent rise in PCR testing over the previous 24 hours. The number of people with COVID-19 in hospital has risen by 10 to 232, and includes seven in intensive care. The number of active cases has dropped to 21,101. Meanwhile, Australia's peak immunisation body has echoed warnings about this year's flu risk to the country's youngest population. Immunisation Coalition chairman Rod Pearce told ABC Radio Adelaide that some toddlers who were born during the COVID pandemic would be experiencing their first flu season. ""Some of the three-year-olds have never seen flu because they were born around COVID, flu wasn't here,"" Dr Pearce said. ""Unless they've been vaccinated they've got absolutely no resistance, so they become a vulnerable group."" The flu vaccine is suitable for children aged six months and over, and is free for all children under five. Dr Pearce, a South Australian GP, said that while flu was often regarded as a ""disease of older people"", the young were catching it at the highest rates this year. ""So far … 15-to-24-year-olds and under-10s have been the highest for notification rates,"" he said. ""That always makes us prick up our ears, because if older people aren't getting sick then we wonder whether there's actually been this strain or a similar strain 30, 40, 50 years ago."" Dr Pearce said while it was too early in the season to predict all of the strains, this year's vaccine was a ""good match"" to the dominant ones already known to be circulating. Australian Medical Association SA branch vice-president John Williams agreed that it was too early to predict the severity of the first proper flu season since the COVID pandemic. ""There's concerns [that] immunity may have waned so we're worried how quickly that might spread and the impact that might have,"" Dr Williams said. Dr Williams said the mix of COVID and flu not only posed a threat to people's health, but could place strain on the hospital system. ""[We] certainly wouldn't like to see people getting COVID and flu at the same time,"" he said. He said getting vaccinated for the flu would help protect people against the virus and reduce transmission. ""There's really very few reasons why everyone can't get the flu vax and that will certainly help the community,"" he said. As well as being free for young children, the flu vaccine is also free for people aged 65 and over, pregnant women, people with medical risk factors, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and people who are homeless.

134,"'Devastating': Over 90pc of reefs on Great Barrier Reef suffered bleaching over summer, report reveals",health,"  Great Barrier Reef bleaching occurred on over 90 per cent of reefs this summer, report reveals More than 90 per cent of coral reefs surveyed on the Great Barrier Reef suffered some form of bleaching this summer, according to a new report. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority annual snapshot details how the 2021-22 summer led to a mass bleaching event of coral. It is the fourth mass bleaching event in seven years on the reef and the first to occur under La Niña conditions. The report says a total of 719 reefs between the Torres Strait and the Capricorn Bunker Group, east of Gladstone, in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, were surveyed from the air. Ninety-one per cent of the reefs exhibited some bleaching. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority chief scientist David Wachenfeld said the good news is that early signs suggest a low mortality rate. ""Bleaching is a stress response but bleached coral is still alive and under the right conditions it can recover and continue to live,"" he said. Dr Wachenfeld said the 2016/17 bleaching event had a high mortality rate, while the bleaching that occurred in 2020 did not kill as much coral. ""The early indications are the mortality won't be very high so we are hoping that we will see most of the coral that is bleached recover, and we will end up with an event rather more like 2020 where yes there was mass bleaching but there was low mortality."" The report said bleaching was mostly seen in the northern and central regions of the reef and was more variable in the southern region reflecting the boundary of lower heat stress exposure. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. The Australian Marine Conservation Society's Lissa Schindler said the annual snapshot report was ""devastating"" news. ""This was a La Niña year, normally characterised by more cloud cover and rain. It should have been a welcome reprieve for our reef to help it recover,"" she said. She called for both major parties to increase their 2030 emissions reductions targets in response to this latest mass bleaching event.

135,Spike in WA COVID cases sparks calls for return of indoor mask mandate,health,"  Western Australia has recorded 17,033 new cases of COVID-19, prompting the Australian Medical Association (AMA)  to ""beg"" for some restrictions to be reintroduced. Wednesday's tally was a 40 per cent jump from Tuesday's figures, bringing the total number of active cases in the state to 68,893, with 275 in hospital. “The numbers in hospital we expect will rise, but [are] certainly well below what was modelled,” Premier Mark McGowan said. Mr McGowan also highlighted the rates at which unvaccinated West Australians were being hospitalised, making up 27 per cent of hospital patients over the last fortnight, despite accounting for only about one per cent of the population. Currently, about one in every 40 West Australians are in isolation with COVID. Mr McGowan said about a third of those were under the age of 19, accounting for about 24,000 people. A further three deaths have been recorded, bringing the death toll since the start of the year to 161. Wednesday’s three deaths date back to May 6 and include a man in his 70s, a man in his 80s and a woman in her 90s. The state's health workforce is continuing to feel the impact of those high case numbers, with 2,252 staff currently furloughed. ""It is difficult to deal with that situation ... so the hospital system will continue to feel pressure because of that,"" Mr McGowan said. Confirmed cases so far: 660,064 Active cases: 87,103 Cases in hospital: 323 Deaths: 216 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 81.3 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department Mr McGowan said Thursday's budget would be proof WA was funding the health system better than any other state or territory in Australia. ""But those issues are difficult to resolve and every state in Australia is going through exactly the same thing, most of them worse than us."" He said the state's Chief Health Officer, Andy Robertson, would continue to monitor case numbers and furloughing, and that reducing elective surgery was one option to free up staff. When Dr Robertson provided his advice to the government on reducing restrictions, he warned cases could increase but Mr McGowan said he was not given a range of how big that jump could be. The Premier again said the key figures to watch were hospitalisation and ICU admission rates, which can lag behind case numbers by up to two weeks. The return of mask mandates is not currently on the agenda, according to Mr McGowan, but he has not ruled out the possibility it could happen in the future. But the AMA's WA president, Mark Duncan-Smith, wants to see a return of the indoor mask mandate after being ""staggered"" by Wednesday's case count. ""For the Premier to not reintroduce some restrictions at this stage may be unforgivable,"" he said. ""I can see where this is going and it scares me greatly."" Dr Duncan-Smith's biggest concern was whether there would be enough staff to cope with further pressure on the health system, with hospitalisation numbers expected to rise next week. ""It will take a week before any restrictions that are introduced now will have any effect at all,"" he said. ""And in the next week, the medical system and the health of West Australians is incredibly vulnerable."" It comes as the government tries to use its majority to rush a second bill through the state's lower house. In a matter of hours on Tuesday, the Legislative Assembly passed an extension to pandemic powers under the Emergency Management Act, which is now before the upper house. On Wednesday, a bill was ""urgently"" introduced to reopen an approval pathway for ""significant projects"" until the end of next year. The streamlined planning approval system was originally introduced to give the construction sector a boost in the early stages of the pandemic. The bill will also allow developers of some projects to apply for an extension to the date by which they have to begin construction. Planning minister Rita Saffioti said it was originally planned that the Part 17 pathway would be replaced by an assessment panel considering 'special matters' by the end of the year. But she said further consultation was needed to address concerns in that new process, and so the previous pathway would be reopened. Ms Saffioti said it was also necessary to extend the time frame of some projects under Part 17, because the same opportunity had been given to projects approved through other schemes, as a result of supply chain and workforce pressures. The push to rush the bill through was swiftly criticised by Liberal leader David Honey. ""It's a shameful process, a cynical process,"" he said. ""A cynical process to ram this through this parliament, why? Because you can, because you've got the numbers."" But the leader of the government in the house, David Templeman, said it was necessary to try to pass the bill on Wednesday. ""I'm sure all of us agree we don't want to see a stall in our economic recovery, we want to make sure we continue to have a robust pipeline of work,"" he said. ""There are time issues associated with the passage of this bill, and that is why it has been declared urgent.""

137,'Avoiding scrutiny': WA's pandemic powers which underpin restrictions have just been extended,health,"  In a matter of hours late yesterday, the WA government rushed legislation through the state's lower house in a bid to hang onto broad-ranging pandemic powers for a further six months. The bill still has to pass the upper house, but that's a mere formality as WA Premier Mark McGowan has complete control over both houses of parliament. It will be the fourth time the powers have been extended since the pandemic began, but it's a little more controversial this time. So what's happening, and why does it matter? Ordinarily, the state government can only do so much without going through parliament to pass legislation. The Emergency Management Act 2005 (WA) provides a framework for the government to exercise additional powers during emergencies, like natural disasters and pandemics, so they can be dealt with quickly and effectively. To access those powers, the Emergency Services Minister has to declare a state of emergency - which the government has done every fortnight since March 15, 2020. They can only do that on the advice of the State Emergency Coordinator, which is currently Police Commissioner Chris Dawson. We'll likely never know what exactly that advice looks like, because the current Minister, Stephen Dawson, revealed in Parliament yesterday it's given verbally at fortnightly meetings. No. The state of emergency can be renewed an unlimited number of times, but generally for no longer than a fortnight at once. The bill that passed the Legislative Assembly last night extends a specific part of the Emergency Management Act — section 72A. That part was added to the Act in 2020, at the start of the pandemic, and was meant to expire after a year. But, because some of the legal directions that underpin WA's pandemic response only have any legal effect because of section 72A, the government has extended it a number of times. At the moment, it's due to expire on July 4, but once the bill that passed last night also passes the upper house, those powers will be available until January 4, 2023. There are a range of ways the government has enforced restrictions over the last two years, and section 72A is just one of them. WA takes a giant step towards living with COVID-19, as a whole raft of restrictions are removed. At the moment it's being used to: But the power is written in really broad terms, including allowing authorised people to take any action or direct another person or group of people to take any action, that is ""reasonably necessary to prevent, control or abate risks associated with the emergency"". Not necessarily. The powers are only available for as long as a state of emergency is in effect. ""They will drop away as soon as the state of emergency is over,"" Premier McGowan said yesterday. ""Real-time"" modelling of WA's Omicron outbreak finds about half a million more people will be infected and deaths will double by the end of June. ""We won't keep the state of emergency in place for any longer than we need to, but if we get rid of them we'll have adverse health outcomes and I don't want to see that."" Mr McGowan says they remain necessary for now, because the remaining ""baseline"" restrictions are helping keep COVID-19 hospitalisations low. But even without section 72A, there are other ways the government could continue to impose restrictions, with or without a state of emergency. For example, workplace vaccine mandates are given effect under the separate Public Health Act. The key concern is that the powers exercised under section 72A aren't really subject to scrutiny in the same way that legislation normally is — despite the fact the directions function in a very similar way to laws passed by parliament. Ordinarily, legislation is debated in parliament, the opposition and other members have the chance to scrutinise it, and the government has to justify why it's passing that law. But that all gets skipped with the Emergency Management Act. Liberal leader David Honey yesterday questioned why other avenues weren't being used to achieve the same results. ""The Public Health Act, as we understand it, gives ample power for the government to make many decisions,"" he said. ""If the Public Health Act is deficient, the government have had two years to amend it. ""We are greatly concerned that the government have avoided a lot of scrutiny on the decisions, and this is just a way to avoid public scrutiny."" South Australia's recently elected Premier Peter Malinauskas yesterday introduced legislation to amend its Public Health Act and allow for the state to end its emergency management direction (which is similar to WA's state of emergency declaration). Those amendments will allow isolation requirements, vaccination and mask mandates in certain places and other rules to continue unaffected. But lockdowns, broad mask mandates and hospitality restrictions would require another state of emergency to be declared to return. Victoria's pandemic laws, which have been supported by many experts, go even further with a pandemic oversight committee. The state's parliament can also disallow measures it doesn't agree with. Mr McGowan has all but ruled out taking a similar path previously, saying the existing legislation, including section 72A, is adequate for WA's needs.

138,Eight-year-old girl admitted to Melbourne hospital with stomach pain dies 21 hours later,health,"  Review launched into death of Amrita Lanka after parents claim their concerns were ignored When Melbourne parents Chandra Sekhar Lanka and Satya Tarapureddi brought their daughter Amrita to Monash Children's Hospital with stomach pains, they had no idea of the tragedy about to unfold over the next 21 hours. Amrita Varshini Lanka was suffering from stomach pains, vomiting and fever on April 29 when her father took her to their general practitioner, who then referred Amrita to the hospital with suspected appendicitis. After two hours of waiting to be triaged in the emergency department, the hospital conducted an abdominal scan on the eight-year-old. Medical staff told her mother it was not appendicitis and that her daughter likely had gastroenteritis. About 9pm that night, Amrita was given fluids administered via an intravenous drip but said she was experiencing ""hard breathing"" soon after. ""She told me, 'Mama, hard breathing, hard breathing', then immediately I pressed the staff assistance button but nobody came,"" she said. ""I went to the reception and checked with them and said 'I've been waiting 20-25 minutes, my daughter is experiencing hard breathing. Can someone come and have a look?'. ""After 15 minutes they came and told me she had an empty stomach — she's not had any food for two days — so it's common, you need not worry."" Ms Tarapureddi said she was told by staff that her daughter could be discharged a few hours after receiving her fluids or in the morning after being reassessed. At 3am the next morning, a doctor took a blood test in response to their concerns about Amrita's breathing – nearly six hours after first sounding the alarm. Three hours later, Amrita was moved to a short-stay room where medical staff realised she was in a critical condition. Soon after, she went into cardiac arrest. Do you know more about this story? Email vicindepth@abc.net.au. If you're sharing sensitive information, read our tips on how to contact us confidentially. Her father was back at home with her nine-year-old brother Venkata and rushed back to hospital upon hearing the news. ""By the time I saw my daughter, her heart [had] stopped for two minutes, but they revived her,"" Mr Lanka said. ""She was saying that 'I want to talk to Dad'. ""I was crying. She was not crying, she was just staring at me, I said to her: 'so many doctors here, you'll be out soon, they're working on it'."" Amrita Lanka died at 10:17am on Saturday morning, about 21 hours after she arrived in hospital. Her parents still do not know the cause of Amrita's death but are welcoming an external investigation into the circumstances that led to her suffering cardiac arrest. ""We want the truth to come out. If it is an external inquiry so be it, but at the end of the day everyone going to hospital needs to feel secure and [we] really need to know what happened in our case,"" Mr Lanka said. Mr Lanka said his wife alerted the hospital up to five times overnight about her daughter's breathing difficulties but was brushed aside every time. ""My wife was pressing that button for staff assistance, staff were coming in but they were dismissing it under some pretext 'probably an empty stomach',"" he said. ""If they had shown some interest towards Amrita and tried to do something towards that starting from 9pm, we might have a different result today — we don't know."" ""If they had put more attention to her, maybe today my Amrita could be sitting next to me,"" Ms Tarapureddi said. ""We just want answers – what happened to my Amrita?"" In a statement, Monash Health said it had contacted the family for support and an investigation would be undertaken. ""This is a very upsetting time for the family, and we offer our sincere condolences to the child's family and friends,"" a Monash Health spokesperson said. Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley also expressed his ""thoughts and deepest sympathies"" for the family. ""Losing a child is not something any parent should have to endure,"" Mr Foley said. ""I've asked Monash Health to ensure they complete a full clinical review and they have already referred the incident to Safer Care Victoria and the Victorian coroner, which is the standard practice when a patient dies in care."" Monash Health has confirmed to the ABC the incident is being treated as a sentinel event, a designation set aside for the most serious cases of patient harm and death that have resulted from adverse patient safety events. Shadow Health Minister Georgie Crozier accused the government of mismanaging the health system. ""The entire system is in crisis, it can't cope. This is a dire situation when you've got the tragic story of that little girl,"" she said. ""They've had no response from government, they've had no apology, they've had nothing."" Premier Daniel Andrews said Amrita's death was a ""terrible tragedy"", but added the COVID-19 pandemic had placed the health system under unprecedented strain. ""There's no doubt though, politics won't solve this nor will Liberal Party health funding cutbacks either,"" he said. ""It's about patients, it's about supporting doctors and ambos and nurses. It's about recognising this is a one in 100-year event and staff are exhausted."" The family had a funeral for their daughter on Saturday. Amrita was described as a lively and chatty girl at home but a calm and shy one outside who was kind to everyone. She loved pets and always wanted to become a vet. Amrita was incredibly close to her older brother, who is still coming to terms with losing his sister. ""After an hour [from Amrita's death] he comes back and says 'when will Amrita be awake?'"" Mr Lanka said. ""That's when I realised he didn't know what death is, he is struggling because it's a small family and most of the time he spent with his sister. ""We were always known as a happy family, now no happiness is in our family. We feel the vacuum.""

139,"This medication is running out and when it's gone, 10 million more people a year could die by 2050",health,"  Antibiotic resistance is threatening our health. Will bacterial infection send us back to the medical dark age? Tony Velkov and Jian Li share the kind of geeky science story that would work perfectly as a Hollywood script. On quiet weekends at the Monash University science labs 20 years ago, the pair discovered they were the only ones crazy — or obsessed — enough to be working on their projects while everyone else was at home enjoying a few days off. Then, when Velkov and Li realised they shared not only a work ethic but a passion for researching bacteria, their personal and professional friendship was sealed. ""We were the only guys working Saturday and Sunday and we kept running into each other,"" Velkov remembers. ""From then on it's just been fun, you know, we sit around for hours talking and brainstorming. We have been a really good team."" Over the past 12 years, the two scientists have been developing a new antibiotic that recently began phase 1 clinical trials in the US. Their intravenous drug targets deadly ""superbugs"" that are difficult to treat but can run rampant in hospital settings, causing pneumonia, blood infections, urinary tract infections, peritonitis and meningitis. This promising new drug, with the uninspiring name QPX9003, has placed the pair on the cusp of achieving something that hasn't been done for decades. No new antibiotics in this class — polymyxins, which target hard-to-kill ""gram-negative"" bacteria — have been approved since the 1950s. In March, their research was published in the journal Nature. For anyone researching bacteria and antibiotics, getting a new drug to a clinical trial is the holy grail. But it's been a lonely, gruelling process for Velkov and Li, who have at times stumped up their own cash to keep the research going. ""It can be a thankless job,"" Velkov says matter-of-factly. But why? Without new antibiotics, the world is on track to re-enter the medical dark ages by 2050, when a simple cut could kill 10 million people a year. So why are they so hard to find? For most of us, antibiotics don't feel like a big deal. At the slightest sign of a cough or a rash many GPs will dash off a prescription for antibiotics and we're all ""popping them like Tic Tacs"", Velkov says. While our medical and pharmaceutical resources have been (importantly) absorbed in solving the COVID-19 pandemic, the problem of antibiotic resistance is continuing to gain pace. Each year in Australia more than 55,000 people are diagnosed with sepsis — when an uncontrollable bacterial infection triggers inflammation throughout the body. If it can't be managed, sepsis can lead to organ failure. And effective antibiotics are a key component of treatment. About 8,500 Australians die from sepsis every year. It's a huge figure, far above the annual road toll and higher than deaths from specific cancers, and it has a huge economic impact too: antibiotic resistance costs the economy about $700 million a year. Many scientists, Velkov included, argue the threat ahead from bacteria is equally as serious as that posed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. So why is money to invest in antibiotic research so hard to come by? Just 100 years ago, as many as one in three deaths was caused by bacterial infections developing from injuries that would barely raise an eyebrow these days. Back then, if bacteria entered a cut or infection took hold after surgery, the wounds were doused in bromide — hugely painful and deadly to healthy cells too — or treated with bloodletting and leeches. Then, in September 1928, British scientist Alexander Fleming returned from his summer holiday to find one of the petri dishes of Staphylococcus bacteria in his lab had a big blob of mould growing in the middle of it. Yet the area around the mould was free of bacteria and Fleming wanted to know why. The answer led to the development of the first antibiotic – penicillin – and by the mid-1940s it had become widely available. Medical care was transformed. It used to take a particular bacterial strain a few decades to evolve to overcome the antibiotic designed to kill it. But these days, says Dr Maytham Hussein, a researcher in alternatives to antibiotics from the University of Melbourne, it takes some bacteria only two or three years to learn to resist a particular antibiotic. Some bacteria become resistant before clinical trials have even been completed. The problem is that bacteria reproduce faster than just about anything on the planet, some strains doubling their numbers in under five minutes. As the human population increases (giving bacteria more places to multiply) and more and more of these people use antibiotics to get over their infections or keep them safe after surgery — or agriculture uses antibiotics to keep infection in animals at bay — bacteria have many more opportunities to become resistant. And as this process speeds up, the probability that bacteria will find a way to overcome antibiotics increases. The result is that our stash of usable antibiotics is dwindling. Those golden staph outbreaks we hear of invading hospitals provide a glimpse of what a post-antibiotic world could look like. Or worse still, a return to the bubonic plague pandemic that devastated Europe, Asia and North Africa in the 1300s. There are plenty of medical experts who believe the post-antibiotic era is already here and COVID has supercharged the need to address the problem. Ventilators that are relied on to treat many of COVID's sickest patients in ICU also place those patients at increased risk of bacterial infection. Before COVID, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VaP) was already a widely noted medical phenomenon, affecting between 5 and 40 per cent of intubated patients. Of those diagnosed with VAP, up to 10 per cent die from a bacterial infection, not the illness that brought them to ICU in the first place. But it's not just desperately ill COVID patients who are vulnerable. Without effective antibiotics, the healthcare we take for granted – from giving birth and knee replacements to heart bypass operations and surgery for cancer – would carry the risk, once again, of exposing the patient to a life-threatening infection. ""This is the slow pandemic,"" says Professor Matt Cooper from the Institute of Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland. ""Politicians and funding bodies [respond to] acute crises, and don't get me wrong COVID is a serious disease, but with antibiotic resistance we are like a frog, slowly boiling on a stove."" With so much at stake, you might think that pharmaceutical companies would be tripping over themselves to invest in the next great antibiotic and back the next Alexander Fleming or Tony Velkov. But there's a problem. The speed with which bacteria challenge and overcome new antibiotics isn't just a scientific problem. It is also an economic one: pharmaceutical companies don't have time to make a profit. Of the antibiotics that do make it to market, most are lucky to have a 10-year life span before bacteria become resistant, Velkov says. And when it costs up to $1 billion to develop a marketable drug, a decade isn't enough time for pharmaceutical companies to get their money back and deliver a profit. Tweaking the drugs to give them longevity isn't much help because when global patent laws run out, typically after about 25 years, the generic manufacturers move in. ""There's not much money in antibiotics,"" Velkov says. ""For pharmaceutical companies, it's literally like a charity, a pro-bono activity for them, and they are not investing."" Cooper agrees: ""It is really simple, [the problem is] money, and everyone is leaving the field because it's so depressing. It's really, really hard to stay motivated."" Instead, big pharma is investing in drugs for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, melanoma and blood clots — which made up three of the top five biggest-selling drugs of 2021. Pfizer's COVID vaccine came in at number one. Moderna at number three. Velkov's close relationship with Li has sustained them both through the long years of research with little but their own scientific curiosity to keep them going. But Velkov says he also found motivation from something deeper: the idea that his work could make a difference. ""He's a very good friend of mine and we work really well together,"" Valkov says of Li. ""Many professions become about reputation, ego and achievement, whereas we don't really care what other people think of us. If our work can actually change the way people live, or help them live better, then our work means something. That's what science and medicine is about. When you lose touch with that central philosophy, you're in trouble."" Nevertheless, he admits matter-of-factly that a career devoted to bacteria and developing antibiotics can be ""a thankless job"". The two scientists years ago gave up expecting R&D funding from Australia. Of course, they had support from the university sector and then tipped in more of their own cash at critical moments, but the big investment required to make their new drug a reality came from overseas. ""It's just all about investment and development, that's all it is,"" says Velkov of the difficulty finding new antibiotics. ""We can fix this problem [of antimicrobial resistance] but governments need to prioritise it. They can't rely on drug companies and they can't rely on Jian Li and myself mucking around in the lab on our days off. We are just two blokes trying to scrounge together materials to build something."" With pharmaceutical companies wary of the financial risk of significant investment, a number of government-backed funding bodies have been set up in other countries to support drug development. Velkov and Li received two $US4.5 million donations from a US-government investment fund known as BARDA, the Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority, that enabled them to finish the research for their intravenous antibiotic. He wishes the Australian government had similar investment capacity: ""That's not even possible in Australia. We don't even have grants that size. Down Under, we just do things too small,"" he believes. Even better, Velkov says, would be establishing a global alliance — in particular, partnering with China where significant research is underway — that can pool medical developments for the greater good. It's an idea Cooper has tried several times, currently as a not-for-profit project that screens compounds for antimicrobial activity with a goal to help researchers discover new compounds that are effective against drug-resistant infections. Funding difficulties are only one part of the problem. ""I want to stress that this is tough,"" says Cooper, pointing out that the technical difficulties of finding and developing new antibiotics are real. Researchers have scoured nature to find new antibiotics from coral reefs, soil and even bat dung but ""there hasn't been much success"", says Cooper, who is preparing to publish his findings outlining the key problems facing the development of antibiotics and flags key areas of promising research. Notwithstanding disappointing results from searching the environment for new sources of antibiotics, the importance of protecting nature remains the key, says Velkov. ""Most of our medicines are natural products and we haven't come close to tapping into all of these natural resources,"" he says. Four avenues are being explored to combat the rise of the superbug. One is to continue to push the message that existing antibiotics must be used sparingly and carefully to minimise the potential for bacteria to become immune. Another is reviving antibiotics that were previously passed over because something better came along. Returning to these discoveries saves research and development money, making them a more attractive investment. Scientists are also searching for ways to support or boost the effectiveness of existing antibiotics by using other drugs and therapies, known as ""potentiators"". Maytham Hussein's work looks at the effect of cannabinoids, which if taken in tablet form can boost the performance of antibiotics. Cooper is undertaking associated research that uses peptides as potentiators. Then there is the phage therapies, a branch of medical science that harnesses viruses to attack and kill bacteria. Finally, there is immune modulation known as ""inflabiotics"", which uses similar strategies to the immune therapies being used successfully in cancer treatment. ""These get the ancient part of our immune system, our innate immunity, to stop making 'bad' inflammation and instead clear the infection with 'good' inflammation,"" Cooper says. He anticipates this therapy would face fewer issues with drug resistance because it targets the immune system, not the bug itself. ""If it is viable, it could be broadly applied,"" he says. Cooper is confident more antibiotics can be found or alternative therapies discovered. But he fears the struggle for funding has made bacterial research a disappearing field. He calculates that fewer than 1,400 researchers — experts in bacteria and antibiotics — remain working around the world. Of those, he estimates most are in their 50s and 60s and due to retire in the next decade. ""At some stage, not only will there be no money for research but all those experts will leave the field,"" he says. ""Ninety years of knowledge about how to discover and develop antibiotics, these miracle drugs that have saved more lives than any other drug, will be gone.""

140,"Josh, a nurse, has been waiting four years to start work in Australia. He almost gave up and went to Canada instead",health,"  When United States nurse Joshua Gregory went back to university in 2018, his only goal was to work in Australia. Australia is experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and he says he has the skill and experience to help. ""I've worked in cardiothoracic care, I've worked in emergency medicine, I've worked in an ICU, I've worked in psychiatry, and I feel that I have a level of flexibility that would really benefit Australia,"" he said. Despite his enthusiasm for moving here, Mr Gregory almost gave up at one point because the process was so hard. He said registering as a nurse and getting a work visa was slow and complicated, with different regulatory bodies not communicating with each other. ""I began this process when I was 32. I am now 36,"" he said. Leading medical groups say red tape is preventing qualified workers like Mr Gregory from moving to Australia. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au. Victorian Healthcare Association chief executive Tom Symondson said Australia needed to prioritise healthcare work immigration. ""We've got an incredibly serious shortage of healthcare workers across the country,"" he said. ""There's no reason why we should be taking so long to process immigration applications for people who are so critical to our healthcare sector."" Mr Gregory had to register as a nurse twice with two different bodies before applying for a visa. That was on top of having to jump through other bureaucratic hoops to meet paperwork requirements. ""I found myself driving eight hours one way to another state in order to be able to have my documents notarised, and I had to do that on three different occasions,"" he said. Across the country nurses are burnt out, exhausted and looking for new jobs. Here's a look at the state of the workforce, and what could be done to help. Registering as a healthcare practitioner in Australia is a lengthy process with many steps that can only be completed one after the other, not simultaneously. The process differs depending on the profession, but each step can take months to finish, delaying the next stage in the process. For example, the first step for GPs is a compatibility assessment by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), which can take more than 10 weeks. Only when that is complete can they start their medical registration, which takes another 10 to 12 weeks to get approved by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). On top of that they need to secure a job offer and apply for a visa through Border Control. Once the doctor arrives in Australia, they need to apply for their registration number and then their Medicare provider number — another 13 weeks. All up, it can take 12 months or more to complete the process. Simon Spalding, who co-owns a medical practice on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, recently spent more than $25,000 on fees recruiting a new GP from the UK. ""It took over a year and some of the delays caused great distress to our doctor,"" he said. ""She took her kids out of school and resigned from her job thinking that the immigration part of it wouldn't take as long as it did and ended up home-schooling and doing locums over Christmas waiting for her visa."" He said he felt the process could be faster, easier and possibly cheaper. ""I think there would be things that you could do at the same time rather than subsequently,"" he said. ""All those steps you have to do one, then the next. And I, in some cases, I don't see any reason for that."" Regulatory bodies contacted by the ABC said they try to make the approval process as smooth as possible, and that it was important to thoroughly check that health professionals were suitable and safe to work in Australia. An AHPRA spokesperson said it actively engaged with health departments, colleges and accreditation providers to streamline applications and avoid duplication. ""We are open to improvements and efficiencies, but these must not be at the sacrifice of robust assessment processes,"" they said. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia (NMBA) and The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Accreditation Council (ANMAC) said skilled migration assessments took on average fewer than four weeks unless there were issues with documentation from other countries. Both agencies also said they worked closely together and with other bodies to enable skilled nurses and midwives to move to Australia. ""We are always willing to work to improve systems and open to efficiency improvements. However, this must not jeopardise public safety,"" an NMBA spokesperson said. The RACGP said it recognised some of the bureaucratic processes involved with recruiting overseas-trained doctors were expensive, cumbersome, and time-consuming. ""The RACGP has made a number of recommendations to fast-track the recruitment of overseas-trained doctors, including deploying a team in the Department of Health to fast-track processing requests through immigration, AHPRA, Medicare and the medical colleges,"" RACGP president Karen Price said. The federal government did not answer questions about whether any work was underway to make the process faster but said the number of skilled visa places would increase next year. Australia was already dealing with a healthcare worker shortage before COVID-19 hit, then workers quitting due to burnout and shutting off immigration made it worse, Mr Symondson said. He said Australia needed a national, multi-pronged approach to deal with the shortage, and that recruiting workers from overseas was part of it. ""If we're too difficult as a country to move into … people who want to work overseas will choose somewhere else,"" he said. ""We need to do everything that we possibly can to make Australia the destination that people choose first and are not put off by our red tape and our long waiting times."" Mr Gregory considered giving up on Australia and moving to Canada instead, simply because it would be easier. ""I feel like many nurses are in that same position,"" he said. ""Do they go to Australia, or do they go to a country that is going to accelerate their journey towards becoming residents or obtaining a work visa?"" The South Australian government has now offered Mr Gregory a sponsored visa. He has not been guaranteed work, but Mr Gregory is hopeful. ""This entire time I've actually used that little colloquialism from Australia, that 'She'll be right', and that I'm going to get there eventually,"" he said We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

141,Labor refuses to confirm electorates getting new urgent care clinics — even though it has already announced them,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Federal Labor is refusing to list the electorates benefiting from one of its centrepiece health commitments, despite the party's frontbenchers and candidates spruiking new medical clinic locations across social media platforms. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese announced a Labor government would fund 50 bulk-billed urgent care medical centres, based at existing GP clinics, at a cost of $135 million over the next four years. With just under two weeks to polling day, Labor is yet to announce some of the locations for the clinics – something which could be passed off as a standard campaign tactic. But the party is also refusing to provide details of clinic locations it has already announced, despite a week of repeated requests by the ABC for an exhaustive list. ""We are identifying broad areas of need,"" Shadow Health Minister Mark Butler told the ABC last month. ""They will run through the whole country, urban and regional, Liberal Party-held seats, Independent seats, Labor Party seats, because they will be targeted at areas of need."" The ABC can account for at least 24 clinics, based on party social media coverage since the policy was first announced in the first week of the campaign. So far the locations appear to be evenly split between Labor and Coalition electorates — but at least 12 sites are in marginal seats, with five in government-held electorates the Opposition is hoping to snatch at the May 21 election. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Mr Albanese was in the New South Wales Hunter Valley, standing alongside Labor candidate for Hunter Dan Repacholi to pledge the first of the clinics would be set up in Cessnock. Labor is hoping to hold on to the seat after the retirement of veteran Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon. His once healthy margin of 12.5 per cent was drastically cut to just 3 per cent in the 2019 election, as voters flocked to One Nation. The party's two most senior South Australians — Mr Butler and Shadow Foreign Minister Penny Wong — were on hand to announce a clinic in the marginal Liberal-held electorate of Boothby in Adelaide's southern suburbs. The federal opposition is bullish about its chances there, despite not having held the seat for decades, after huge swings to Labor in the area at the March state election. Mr Butler joined with Labor's Peta Murphy to announce a clinic in the marginal seat of Dunkley in Melbourne's south-east. Another clinic was slated for the Geelong region, to benefit the safe Labor electorate of Corio and the marginal seat of Corangamite. Shadow Education Minister Tanya Plibersek announced two for the Northern Territory over the weekend, one in each of the marginal Labor-held seats of Solomon and Lingiari. Shadow Aged Care Minister Clare O'Neil was on the ground in Tasmania to announce three clinics on the island – in Launceston, Burnie and Hobart. Labor is hoping regain the two northern Tasmanian seats of Bass and Braddon, currently held by the Liberals. Member for Dobell, Emma McBride and Labor candidate for Robertson, Gordon Reid have announced one clinic each for their NSW Central Coast seats – two electorates hotly contested at every election. In northern Victoria, Labor Senator Raff Ciccone travelled to Shepparton to pledge a clinic in the Nationals electorate of Nicholls, while fellow senator Murray Watt joined the party's local candidate to announce one in Bundaberg in the Queensland electorate of Flynn. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese gear up for the third and final leaders' debate. Labor frontbencher Shayne Neumann pledged a clinic for his seat of Blair, where the opposition experienced an almost 7 per cent swing against it in 2019. Others have been flagged in the WA seats of Perth, Hasluck, Forrest, Tangney, Moore, Brand and Durack. In Victoria, clinics have also been earmarked for the Labor electorates of Lalor and Ballarat, and the newly created notionally Labor seat of Hawke. Anthony Albanese has regularly referenced support for the policy from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), which has expressed cautious optimism about the proposal as long as it builds upon existing GP infrastructure. ""While we need to work through the detail of this proposal, a model that seeks to reduce duplication of primary care services and build on existing general practice clinics and infrastructure is something we would be happy to explore,"" RACGP president Karen Price said. Labor did not respond to the ABC's request for information before deadline, and did not provide any further justification for its choice of clinic locations.

142,'It's a joke': Aged care workers use day off to rally for better work conditions after strike delayed until after election,health,"  Hundreds of aged care workers in Queensland and Western Australia have walked off the job in a stand for better pay and work conditions, but South Australian aged care staff remained diligently at work. An application by almost 1,700 Southern Cross Care employees to strike for three-and-a-half hours was rejected by the Fair Work Commission on the grounds that the strike would cause significant staff shortages that would threaten the safety of aged care residents. Instead, commissioner Chris Platt delayed the industrial action by two weeks, which will allow South Australian workers to strike a day after the May 21 federal election. In his decision, Mr Platt said the industrial action would put about 300 residents at two Southern Cross Care sites at considerable risk and would increase the workload of non-union members by between 28 and 76 per cent. ""It is clear that the proposed protected industrial action will add extra pressure to a workplace which is already under pressure,"" he said. ""I cannot foresee how the sites with greater union density will be able to cope with the loss of labour. ""It is probable that the reduction in labour as a result of the protected industrial action will place some of the most vulnerable members of our population at risk."" About 100 South Australian aged care employees used their day off to rally in Adelaide's CBD, demanding a 25 per cent pay rise and better staff-to-patient ratios. Southern Cross Care worker Despina, who did not want her surname used, said it was ""ironic"" staffing shortages were the reason her colleagues were unable to strike, given that was precisely the issue they were protesting. The Coalition has promised billions since the royal commission, but Labor is making aged care an election issue. ""We're always understaffed and run off our feet. Staffing has always been an issue, but COVID did make it worse,"" she said. ""That's why we're protesting. For them to say we can't protest because we're understaffed … it's a joke. ""We're not endangering the residents; they're endangering the residents by not having enough staff."" Fellow aged care worker and protester Grace Gbala said she wanted her voice to be heard before the federal election. ""Our pay needs to increase by at least 30 per cent. Or maybe more. People are trusting us with their parents and we want to give them the care they deserve,"" she said. ""I'll be voting Labor because they want to change aged care for the better."" Another worker, Shannon Antonio, said increasing pay was crucial to addressing staff shortages, mirroring one of the main recommendations handed down in the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety last year. ""Even when they're trying to staff us at decent levels, we can't get people to fill those shifts because we can't get anyone to work in this industry. ""Why would you, when you can make more money serving coffee, or working at a check-out, or delivering pizza? ""It's really hard to get young people to pursue a career in aged care when they're going to get paid more in a job where they don't need any training, with a lot less responsibility and stress."" United Workers Union aged care director Carolyn Smith blasted the Fair Work Commission's decision to delay industrial action, arguing Southern Cross Care had made no effort to replace staff. ""When pressed, Southern Cross Care admitted they had not sought extra workers to cover possible strike action or considered offering extra pay to staff those shifts,"" Ms Smith said. ""That doesn't sound like an employer making a serious effort to address their outlandish claim that residents were at risk of dying if workers walked off the job between 11:30am and 4:30pm."" A spokesman for Southern Cross Care said the provider was ""advocating for change on behalf of staff"". ""We are … supporting the Australian Aged Care Collaboration, who are petitioning all political parties to commit additional funds towards a wage increase for aged care staff as recommended by the royal commission,"" he said. ""This is a reasonable expectation of consumer groups, aged care staff, the union movement and the broader community."" In Queensland, about 300 aged care workers walked off the job and gathered in the Brisbane CBD, protesting for a 25 per cent pay increase and better conditions. Federal opposition aged care services spokeswoman Clare O'Neil said it was ""diabolical"" the recommendations from the aged care royal commission had not been implemented. ""The aged care workers who are standing behind me are taking strike action, really as a last straw. They have been fighting for years and years and years to get the issues in aged care addressed,"" Ms O'Neil said. ""Now when Scott Morrison cut funding to aged care when he was treasurer, it didn't affect his life; that affected the life of the people who are standing behind me and the residents that they cared for. ""What aged care workers face today is a situation that just can't continue. They are not able to do the task that we are asking of them every day."" The federal government announced on the day the royal commission's report was handed down that it would spend almost $500 million on immediate measures to overhaul the aged care sector. Glenda, an aged care worker of 24 years, said staff did the best they could but the situation was dire. ""The last couple of years with the pandemic has brought out the worst again, unfortunately,"" she said. ""It's mentally draining. The residents still expect the same level of care if there's six of you on, but sometimes there's only three of you. ""They still need their showers, they still need to be fed, they still need to be toileted, so most of us stay behind to do that extra because we don't want to see them suffer."" A similar number of protesters gathered at the cultural centre in the Perth suburb of Northbridge to call for better pay and conditions for aged care workers.

143,Long COVID clinics established to manage chronic symptoms in SA,health,"  South Australia's health system will expand its capacity to tackle a growing number of long COVID cases, with dedicated clinics established to treat what is now being described by some as a ""pandemic"" in its own right. Four clinics for people with long-term effects of the virus have opened across metropolitan Adelaide, at the Royal Adelaide, Queen Elizabeth and Women's and Children's hospitals, and Flinders Medical Centre. The clinics are designed to help people who are still experiencing significant symptoms three months after infection, such as fatigue, body aches, shortness of breath and brain fog. Central Adelaide Local Health Network (CALHN) infectious diseases expert Renjy Nelson — who helped to develop the state's long COVID plan — said the condition was defined as having ""symptoms at least 12 weeks after the acute infection, lasting for at least two months without an alternative explanation"". ""Long COVID is certainly an entity we need to be aware of — it's in fact actually now even being addressed as the 'long COVID pandemic' because of the sheer number,"" Dr Nelson said. ""We know there's over 2 to 3 million people around the world who are suffering from long COVID. ""We commonly see people with breathlessness — people who are high achievers who were very fit prior to this now finding themselves not able to climb a flight of stairs."" Dr Nelson said the new clinics included neurologists, neuropsychologists, cardiologists, respiratory physicians, rheumatologists and immunologists. ""We started putting together a group of clinicians when we first started seeing patients from the Ruby Princess who, even six months after their infection, continued to remain unwell,"" he said. On Tuesday, SA Health reported 3,683 new infections and the deaths of three women aged from their 70s to their 90s. There were 222 people in hospital, six of whom were in intensive care and one on a ventilator. Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Emily Kirkpatrick said the growing prevalence of long COVID should act as a strong incentive for eligible South Australians to get their third vaccine dose. ""We already know from the early data that having three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will reduce your risk of developing long COVID,"" she said. Dr Kirkpatrick encouraged people who were still feeling sick weeks after their initial diagnosis to seek medical advice. ""At the four-to-six week mark after someone has had COVID-19, if they are still having symptoms at that point in time — such as shortness of breath, muscle aches and pains, memory fog, mental health issues — it's important for them to go and see their general practitioner,"" she said. Health Minister Chris Picton said GPs would then be able to direct patients to one of the clinics. ""People will be able to refer to these clinics via their general practitioner if after 12 weeks they're still facing significant symptoms,"" he said. ""This will then enable a single point of contact to be able to help with what could be a wide range of different medical issues they could be facing."" Clinics for long COVID patients have already opened in other parts of Australia, including at public hospitals in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. Mr Picton today announced an investigation into the case of a 92-year-old woman who was forced to wait two hours outside the Lyell McEwin Hospital emergency department on Sunday night. Maureen Wortley attended the hospital after suffering a fall during a Mother's Day dinner, but was told to wait outside after completing her rapid COVID-19 test. Other patients have since reported similar experiences. ""We are seeing terrible circumstances, of great-grandmothers being left out in the cold,"" opposition health spokeswoman Ashton Hurn said today. Mr Picton said he had asked former national chief medical officer Chris Bagley to investigate the matter. Asked whether he could guarantee no further patients would be forced to wait outside, Mr Picton said he had been advised that it ""would be very, very rare if that was to have to happen"" again. ""We are doing everything we possibly can to avoid that from happening,"" he said. ""A standard set of arrangements has now been put in place to keep people safe but also make sure we don't see the shocking scenes we saw on Sunday night,"" he said. He said one of the reasons why Ms Wortley had been forced to wait outside the hospital was because of ongoing works at the site that had begun under the previous government but had not been completed on schedule. The opposition today called on the government to release a plan to battle the combined effects of COVID and influenza on the health system over the coming months. ""We are headed for a double whammy this winter, dealing not only with thousands of COVID cases per day but also with the first full flu season since 2019,"" Ms Hurn said. South Australia's Emergency Management Council (EMC) met earlier today, with Police Commissioner Grant Stevens indicating his role as state coordinator could come to an end within weeks. He said it would depend on the passage of the government's bill — on how COVID is managed once the emergency declaration ends — through parliament. ""We'll see how it unfolds, we can't forecast the result of the parliamentary process,"" he said. He said the issue of mask wearing in schools would be reviewed at the next EMC meeting.

144,New York Times changes 'entirely unintentional' fraught Wordle answer,health,"  New York Times changes fraught Wordle answer amid abortion debate The New York Times moved swiftly to change Monday's answer to its daily Wordle puzzle out of fear it would be seen as some sort of commentary on the debate over abortion rights. The game, which became a sensation late last year and was bought by the Times in January, gives users six tries to guess a different five-letter word each day. Yet the Times scrambled when it discovered that Monday's word, which had been entered into Wordle's computer program last year, was ""fetus."" The timing was particularly fraught given last week's leaked report of a draft US Supreme Court decision that would strike down the 50-year-old Roe v Wade ruling governing the ability of women to receive abortions. The appearance of ""fetus"" was ""entirely unintentional and a coincidence,"" the newspaper said in a message to readers on Monday. Here's what we know about a leaked bombshell document about the US Supreme Court's plans for America's abortion law. ""At New York Times Games, we take our role seriously as a place to entertain and escape, and we want Wordle to remain distinct from the news,"" the message said. The Times changed Monday's answer to a different word, which a spokesman said the ""vast majority"" of users saw. But some people who had not refreshed their browsers saw ""fetus"" instead, spokesman Jordan Cohen said. He would not say whether The Times had received any complaints about ""fetus"". Wordle was invented by Josh Wardle, a Brooklyn software engineer, as a gift for his partner and took off when he began posting it online. Players guess words and hone in on the correct answer as the game tells them if their guesses contain letters in the word of the day. The Times bought his invention for more than $US1 million ($A1.44 million) and is revamping the technology to make sure every user is seeing the same word every day, the newspaper said. Mr Cohen said millions of people play Wordle each day.

145,WA COVID cases surge 20 per cent to reach new record for second day running,health,"  WA records fresh peak with 12,390 new COVID cases after reporting third-worst day for ambulance ramping Western Australia has set a fresh COVID record with 12,390 new infections, after the state recorded its third-highest day of ambulance ramping yesterday. More than a quarter of St John ambulances were left waiting outside hospitals yesterday, forcing the organisation to put out an emergency warning there would be delays in reaching people. St John said it was receiving up to 50 calls an hour for help at one point, far above the 30 to 35 it can usually cope with. ""It was a pretty tough night for ramping yesterday,"" Chief Operating Officer Antony Smithson told ABC Perth Radio ""We do suspect there was an increase in the number of calls coming in relating to COVID."" Today's new COVID peak represents a 20 per cent jump from the 10,394 infections recorded yesterday. Another six deaths have been recorded, while the number of people in hospital with the virus continues to rise, currently sitting at a new high of 286. A record number of West Australians currently have the virus, with about 61,775 active cases. The number of ambulances ramped at hospitals yesterday also prompted St John to activate its COVID escalation plan and put out a message on social media telling people it was extremely busy with high demand for ambulances in the metropolitan area and there would likely be delays. For the first time in its history, St John is warning Perth residents of extremely high demand for its services amid escalating COVID numbers. St John aims to reach 90 per cent of calls within 15 minutes for emergencies, but the massive demand meant it knew that benchmark could not be reached. ""With the high number of calls we had coming into the state operations centre, we knew we'd expect delays in reaching those people,"" Mr Smithson said. One caller to St John yesterday was Yvonne, who told ABC Radio Perth she was vomiting and had a fever but was informed she would have to wait 90 minutes for an ambulance and was asked if someone else could take her to hospital instead. Her neighbour drove her and she found ""seven or eight ambulances ramping"", before being told it may be hours before she could be seen. ""I was put on a bench in the car park,"" she said. While St John said demand had now eased and the escalation plan was deactivated at 5.30am this morning, it was expected to remain busy for the rest of the week. Early figures compiled by St John suggested 336 hours of ambulance ramping were recorded yesterday, among the top-three worst days ever. With 25-30 per cent of ambulances ramped outside hospitals, St John contacted emergency departments and the health department asking them to clear space as soon as possible. Dr Peter Allely, the WA faculty chair of the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine, explained the problem was emergency departments were full of people already admitted and waiting for beds in the hospitals. While Dr Alley estimated COVID-19 presentations were down 10-15 per cent from a couple of months ago, the impact was still significant because of the infection control measures required. He told ABC Radio Perth the biggest impact on hospitals was the number of staff sick with COVID-19 or isolating as close contacts; routinely 20 per cent of staff on his recent shifts. ""It means hospitals aren't able to staff beds as they would,"" he said. He was concerned there would be a repeat of yesterday's crisis. ""This is a problem that's not going to go away soon,"" he said. Premier Mark McGowan said COVID-19 was the main reason ambulances and hospitals were under so much pressure. ""That's hard to avoid, that's hard to fix at this point in time,"" Mr McGowan said. He said 10 per cent of ambulance staff were off work because they had the virus or were close contacts. ""What that means is, on any given day, a range of ambulances are not on the roads because staff can't work,"" Mr McGowan said. But St John said it had more ambulances on than its minimum requirement yesterday, with more than 80 on the road. The Premier said the virus was also hitting hospitals hard, with 2,500 staff off because they had COVID-19 or were close contacts. ""That's putting enormous stress on the system because the staffing is delaying people's admission to hospital and it means a whole lot of ambulance paramedics are not on the roads,"" he said. ""And on top of that we're having enormous numbers of calls, particularly respiratory cases called through to triple-0, so I'd request people who don't need to call an ambulance, if they can try to find other ways of accessing health services."" Opposition health spokesperson Libby Mettam said the situation was a result of five years of underinvestment in the health system. When asked about the pressure on hospitals previously, the government has pointed to its investment in hundreds of new beds being opened across the system. While some of those beds have already opened, others are not due to be available until later in the year. ""How extraordinary that the government's commitment to additional beds will not see those beds open until October this year, after the winter flu season,"" Ms Mettam said Meanwhile, the WA government is extending its COVID emergency powers into 2023. New legislation will allow the government to continue requiring close contacts to isolate, mandate the use of face masks and restrict cruise ships and movement in and out of remote communities. The extended powers can be in place until January 3, 2023 but will only be in place while the COVID State of Emergency is still in effect. ""It does not mean the State of Emergency will remain in place until that time, as it may end earlier,"" the government said in a statement. Premier Mark McGowan insisted the new laws were necessary to ensure the state could safely manage the pandemic. ""If we don't have those laws, we can't put those things in place,"" he said. The State Government will introduce legislation to parliament today to amend the Public Health Act to include a ""baseline"" level of COVID-19 rules. Here's a look at what that means. South Australia has introduced amendments to its Public Health Act, which would allow it to continue enforcing COVID-19 requirements and restrictions even when its emergency management declaration ends. WA Liberal leader David Honey argued the same approach could be taken in WA, adding it was unnecessary to extend WA's emergency powers. Dr Honey said the ""greater majority"" of controls the government wants to maintain could be dealt with under the Public Health Act, adding the state was ""no longer in a crisis"". ""When this pandemic started, clearly everyone was uncertain...[but] this pandemic has been going on for two years,"" he said.

146,'It's appalling': Delay to abortion law reform dismays experts,health,"  South Australia decriminalised abortion more than a year ago, but nothing has changed While the future of abortion access in the United States makes international headlines, South Australia is behind the rest of Australia in implementing its new abortion laws. It's been 15 months since South Australia joined the rest of the country to pass laws to decriminalise abortion. However, there's still no word on when those laws will take effect, with regulations still being considered. Flinders University associate professor and abortion advocate Catherine Kevin said the unexplained delays have caused unnecessary suffering for women. Dr Kevin teaches and researches in the fields of Australian history and feminist history. ""We are frankly baffled by this. We don't understand the reason for the delay,"" Dr Kevin said. ""We are really, really frustrated [because] every day we live under the old laws those obstacles to accessing abortion remain in place."" Those obstacles include particular barriers for those who do not live in Adelaide. Women must seek permission from two doctors to have an abortion and cannot yet access abortion medication via telehealth. Once new regulations are in place, women will be able to access medication for abortions up to nine weeks remotely online and won't need to travel. She says it will alleviate stress for regional women once the new laws are in place. ""It will also be relevant to those suffering from COVID in the city as well,"" she said. ""It impacts by increasing the time and monetary costs."" Health bodies are equally confused by the delays. Obstetrician Dr Brian Peat said that the delays do not make sense. ""It's appalling. I'm very surprised. We don't know what the hold-up is. I'm very privy to the hold-up,"" Dr Peat said. ""The president of the Australian Medical Association [AMA] has regular meetings with the new Minister for Health, Chris Picton. ""We have looked at the regulations, the AMA commented on them a few months ago."" But Mr Picton did not have answers when questioned by the ABC about when these laws would take effect. ""The previous government started various committees to look into the various regulations. That work stalled before the election,"" Mr Picton said. ""Right now, we are looking at what led to those problems, what the remaining issues are."" ""It has been a very long time [since the] parliament [passed] the law.""

147,Can taking vitamins and supplements help you recover from COVID?,health,"  Australia's surge in COVID-19 cases this year has seen many people looking for ways to protect themselves or boost their immunity and recovery. An upswing in sales of dietary supplements has followed. In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration includes vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, plant extracts and microbiome supplements under the term ""complementary medicine"". The supplement industry's global estimated worth was about US $170 billion ($239 billion) in 2020. Australian complementary medicines revenue was estimated at $5.69 billion in 2021 — doubling in size over the past decade. The latest data shows 73 per cent of Australians bought complementary medicines in the previous year, with vitamins featuring in more than half of purchases. But how likely are these purchases to be effective in preventing COVID-19 or treating it? Historically, the public has purchased supplements from sources that also provide healthcare advice. Lockdowns and blanket health messages about social distancing and personal hygiene have created a new normal. So people are doing more shopping online for supplements and turning to the internet, friends or social media for vitamin recommendations. For some, this has led to an unhealthy fear of COVID-19 (coronaphobia) and negative impacts on daily life. As with any medicine, consumers should seek information from reliable sources (doctors, pharmacists or evidence-based peer-reviewed articles) about the potential benefits and harms of supplements before purchase. Strong evidence supports vaccination as effective against the acute respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. Researchers have also looked at whether supplements may prevent or reduce the duration and severity of this viral infection by boosting the immune response. Deficiencies in essential nutrients that support immune function (vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc and selenium) have been shown to increase susceptibility to infection, including COVID-19. But there is little evidence supplementation in a healthy person prevents respiratory infections such as COVID-19. An evidence gap exists between a supplement's action in laboratory or animal studies and findings from well designed and conducted clinical trials. Ready access to supplements without a prescription from a myriad of online and shopfront sources and the uncontrolled spread of claims that supplements can prevent or treat COVID-19 symptoms has created an ""infodemic"". These claims are fuelled by supplement manufacturers being able to ""list"" their products on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, with limited evidence of safety or effectiveness. This appearance of official approval tallies with the common misperception that ""natural"" means ""safe"". Supplements can cause harm in the form of adverse effects, drug interactions and expense. They also add to a patient's medication burden, may delay more effective therapy, or give false hope to the vulnerable. The recent COVID A to Z Study illustrates some of the challenges involved. It was designed to test the effectiveness of high-dose zinc, vitamin C, and a combination of both, to shorten the duration of COVID-related symptoms compared with usual care in adult outpatients with confirmed infection. These nutrients were chosen because: The authors planned to include 520 patients but the safety monitoring committee recommended the study be stopped early due to the low likelihood of detecting significant outcome differences between the groups. There were also more adverse effects (nausea, diarrhoea, and stomach cramps) reported in the supplement groups than in those receiving usual care. Despite the large variety of complementary medicines marketed, most clinical trials to date have studied the impact of vitamin D, vitamin C or zinc to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19, improve rates of hospitalisation or death. Even with high treatment doses, results have been generally disappointing. Vitamin D, zinc and some probiotics may be beneficial to prevent viral infections. Vitamins D, C, A, zinc, calcium and some probiotics may be beneficial to treat viral infections. But other supplements studied (including copper, magnesium, selenium and echinacea) are unlikely to be beneficial or are not supported by sufficient data. However, supplements may be beneficial when individuals are unable to achieve a balanced and varied diet. High doses or chronic use of COVID-19 supplements have also been linked with adverse effects: vitamin D with muscle pain and loss of bone mass; vitamin A with elevated liver function tests and blurred vision; vitamin E with bleeding risk; plant extracts, magnesium with gastrointestinal effects; and selenium with hair loss and brittle nails. So, the evidence is not convincing that taking vitamins and supplements will prevent you catching COVID-19 or help you recover from the infection, unless you have a known nutrient deficiency or a poor diet.

148,"Matt caught COVID-19 in January, but he's now lost almost 25 kilos and is still not over it",health,"  Matt Schneider describes his brush with COVID-19 in late January as ""relatively typical"". He spent three or four days in bed with fevers and flu-like symptoms before recovering and launching back into his busy life. But the virus had a sting in its tail and about one month later he was struck down. ""This is the most unwell I've ever been,"" Mr Schneider said. ""What started as a relatively annoying cough developed into quite severe fatigue."" The father of three lives at Tamborine Mountain, inland from the Gold Coast, and works as a town planning consultant at the glitter strip. His exhaustion was so severe he sometimes had to sleep in his car between appointments or before driving home. ""At the drop of the hat in the middle of the day I would feel so fatigued I just had to find something soft to lie down on,"" he said. The 38-year-old had received two doses of a COVID vaccine and contracted the virus just before he was due for his third. He lost almost 25 kilograms which he said was ""confronting"" for his family and colleagues. ""The coughing kept building up, over time that became more and more debilitating … at its worst a few weeks ago [I was] struggling to sleep, no appetite, struggling to eat, struggling to keep the food down that I did eat,"" he said. ""The symptoms as recently as Easter had me in bed for almost all of those four days, I think I was out of bed for about three hours over that long weekend."" Mr Schneider said getting medical answers was ""frustratingly slow"". ""It was really a 12-week exercise between starting to feel the symptoms and then really getting to any point where the medical treatment was starting to make a difference,"" he said. ""Three months is a long time to wait to start feeling a little bit better."" After having chest X-rays, CT scans and blood tests he was prescribed steroids and antibiotics for a secondary lung infection and has been improving with rest. He said more treatment options for people struggling with long COVID would be ""a great investment"". ""We've come out of the first couple of phases of the COVID pandemic and this is a new thing for us to collectively think about,"" he said. Describing it as a ""post-COVID-19 condition"", the World Health Organization said long COVID occurs in people with a history of probable or confirmed infection ""usually three months from the onset of COVID-19"" with symptoms that last for at least two months and cannot be explained by another diagnosis. It lists the common symptoms as: It said symptoms may persist from the initial illness or start following an initial recovery and can ""fluctuate or relapse"" over time. Research published in June last year followed 94 per cent of the COVID cases diagnosed in New South Wales between January and May 2020. It found 80 per cent of those with the virus recover within one month, but about 5 per cent ""will continue to experience symptoms three months later"". Brisbane-based general practitioner and Australian Medical Association Queensland director, Maria Boulton, said the data on long COVID in Australia was ""changing all the time"". ""At the moment the estimate is about 5 per cent of Australians with acute COVID will go and develop long COVID,"" Dr Boulton said. Vice president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Bruce Willett, said given the time it takes for patients to develop long COVID, the state has only just started to recognise cases. ""We're currently at the height of the pandemic now, we're seeing the most cases that we've seen in Queensland, so I think we can expect those cases [of long COVID] to really ramp up over the next two to three months,"" Dr Willett said. Queensland has officially recorded more than 1 million cases of COVID since the start of the pandemic alongside 905 deaths. Dr Boulton said the state ""most definitely"" needs dedicated long COVID clinics – staffed by a range of health workers – in both metropolitan and rural and remote areas. ""It's AMA Queensland's position that these clinics should have already been established – we knew that COVID was going to hit our shores,"" she said. ""We know from the experience overseas that people were going to get long COVID and we believe that now we're playing catch up and it's important that those clinics get established urgently."" Dr Willett said patients with long COVID have a ""whole constellation"" of symptoms and there was ""no silver bullet"" in treating the condition. ""It requires a team approach of psychologists, GPs, other specialists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and a whole team behind the treatment of long COVID,"" he said. Dr Willett said it would be ""prudent"" for authorities to start planning multi-disciplinary clinics. ""It takes a while to get those in place and I think the sooner we get working on that the better,"" he said. Dr Willett said while GPs will be able to look after many patients with long COVID, there will be a ""significant number"" of people who need referral to a dedicated service for intensive help. Both doctors highlighted the importance of vaccination in reducing long COVID. ""We know that even two vaccines will at least halve your chances of getting long COVID, so very important to get vaccinated,"" Dr Willett said. ""There's something of a belief that we're over this COVID situation — we absolutely are not."" Dr Boulton said measures including mask wearing and better ventilation should be considered to reduce the number of COVID infectious. ""I wouldn't want to be in the 5 per cent that get long COVID,"" she said. ""We've treated a lot of people with, for example chronic fatigue following diseases like glandular fever. ""It's not pleasant, it's not a short journey – if we can prevent it, that makes perfect sense."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Clinics for long COVID patients have already opened in other parts of Australia, including at public hospitals in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide. A Queensland Health spokesperson said anyone who continues to have COVID symptoms in the weeks and months after their infection should speak with their GP. In a statement, Queensland Health said it was ""actively considering options for dedicated treatment pathways for long COVID, which may include established clinics"".

ABC Investigations has spoken to more than a dozen current and former NDIA staff who say they have faced disability discrimination while working at the agency. At least six workers have sued the NDIA for alleged disability discrimination in the past five years. Some staff with disabilities say the agency has failed to provide them with the assistive technology and physical adjustments to their workspaces to enable them to do their jobs properly. Others point to basic accessibility failures, like photocopiers and even toilet rolls in office bathrooms installed out of reach of staff in wheelchairs. In those cases that have made it to court, the agency has settled with the worker and required them to sign a non-disclosure agreement in return for financial compensation – so they cannot speak publicly about their experiences. But Ms Minjoot is risking her job by speaking out about what she says is a pattern of discrimination that has forced her go on sick leave and lodge a workers compensation claim for emotional distress. ""I don't want sympathy. I just want understanding, so I can do my job,"" she said. The NDIA declined to do an interview but in a statement rejected claims it had a widespread problem with disability discrimination. ""We regret that a very small number of NDIA staff with disability feel they have not had a positive experience while working with the agency,"" it said. The NDIA describes itself as an ""employer of choice"" for people with disabilities and says this is highlighted by the fact that 19 per cent of its employees identify as having a disability – well above its target of 15 per cent. But Ms Minjoot said that claim is challenged by her experiences – and those of her colleagues with disabilities. ""I've been there since the doors opened … and that's nearly eight years in June,"" she said. ""And honestly, it's getting worse."" The NDIA has been keen to highlight Ms Minjoot's success in the past, featuring her photograph and an interview with her in its 2015 annual report. But she said she began experiencing discrimination on her second day on the job in Perth in 2014, when the training for her role was delivered via a PowerPoint presentation that she could not read. ""I couldn't see the screens. They had two big TVs on the wall,"" she said. ""I was … crying because I felt I wasn't included. I was the only one there with a vision impairment. I felt really singled out like an idiot, I felt stupid. And I'm not stupid."" She said that although she repeatedly asked for more accessible training, whenever she started a new role at the agency, she would arrive at a training session only to be presented with material she could not read. ""Everything is going smoothly and then they would move me to another team, and we start all over again because they have no idea,"" she said. Ms Minjoot said over the past eight years, she has only been able to meet her performance targets by teaching herself how to use the agency's systems or relying on help from colleagues. She said the discrimination did not end with inaccessible training. Ms Minjoot said that at one point in 2016 she and the other four staff in her office with disabilities were put together in the one team without explanation. ""Like we were in the too-hard basket, that's how it felt,"" she said. ""We were isolated from the rest of the office."" No system is 100 per cent secure, but the Signal app can be used to protect your identity by using end-to-end encryption. Please read the terms and conditions of the app to work out if it is the best method of communication for you. The NDIA did not respond directly to questions about Ms Minjoot's experience working at the agency. The Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) said it regularly receives requests for help from NDIA staff experiencing disability discrimination. ""The National Disability Insurance Agency has an appalling record when it comes to the treatment of people with a disability,"" CPSU deputy secretary Beth Vincent-Pietsch said. ""And it's so disappointing because these are the employees who have lived experience of disability, so they are able to provide such great insights for this agency and they should be so highly valued. ""But instead, so many people have come to the union talking about the fact that they are not getting the support that they need."" Adam Cooper started working at the NDIA in 2019 when he was brought on to help improve the agency's assistive technology for staff and participants with disabilities. ""I thought it was a fantastic opportunity for someone with a visual impairment who has been working in the digital accessibility space for more than a decade,"" he said. But Mr Cooper, who has a vision impairment called retinitis pigmentosa, said he became frustrated after a few months in the job about the agency's unwillingness to fix accessibility problems with its internal IT systems. ""I was stunned at the level of ignorance in the organisation,"" he said. ""For a while there I would say that the 'I' in NDIA actually stood for 'ignorance'."" One of Mr Cooper's main frustrations – shared with other staff with vision impairments – was that parts of the agency's main participant records system were incompatible with the screen-reading software program, Job Access With Speech (JAWS). He said that meant many vision-impaired staff would be unable to complete simple tasks quickly – or at all. ""People with certain types of disabilities were really struggling to actually get their job done,"" he said. ""People were on reduced KPIs because the systems they use were not suitable for them. They were having to pass whole chunks of their role over to other people, because they simply can't do them."" Mr Cooper said the agency was in the process of updating its systems to be compatible with screen-reading software, but progress stalled. ""It just became much like any other government department with digital accessibility, that you would encounter the same kinds of roadblocks,"" he said. ""It's too expensive, or it's too hard or it's not such a priority."" He said some of the agency's practices required staff with disabilities to perform tasks that were simply unworkable for them. ""You'd have these ridiculous business processes that require blind people to print out a letter, sign it and then put it in an envelope and send it to a participant,"" he said. ""That's just nonsensical."" Mr Cooper quit the agency in frustration in July last year and is now speaking publicly in the hope the NDIA will make its systems more accessible. ""Treating the staff with disability as a lower priority in terms of being able to access systems is clearly discriminatory,"" he said. ""Having a disability is hard enough. You don't need to have it rubbed in your face if you get your dream job in NDIA only to be told that you're just not worthy of it."" In its statement, the NDIA said the ""vast majority"" of its customer management system is compatible with the screen-reading program. ""Where issues are identified, we work with Services Australia who manage our Customer Records System, to resolve them,"" it said. The agency said it was currently developing a new customer record system that aimed to be compliant with international accessibility guidelines. ""The agency takes a person-centred and individualised approach to working with employees with disability, to make reasonable adjustments to workplace processes and arrangements as required, which may include an amendment to an individual's KPIs,"" it said. The CPSU said the lack of support for some staff with disabilities has been compounded by broader problems with heavy workloads at the agency. In August last year, the union complained to the Commonwealth public service workplace safety regulator, Comcare, about the psychological impact of work intensification on NDIA staff. ""People have reported sleep disturbances, people reported having to use medication and falling into depression,"" Ms Vincent-Pietsch from the CPSU said. ""It's not uncommon for people to be found crying in the bathrooms."" Comcare launched an investigation and in January this year told the CPSU the NDIA had contravened federal workplace health and safety legislation. Specifically, Comcare said in its letter it had found the NDIA ""did not provide and maintain safe systems of work, so far as reasonably practicable, relating to psychosocial risks associated with workload management"". In its statement, the NDIA said Comcare's investigation had not resulted in a ""formal breach"". ""At the time of the final report, the Comcare inspector's view was that the agency had developed a well-consulted, corrective action workplan to manage the concern,"" it said.

150,Michael had top-tier private health insurance but still couldn't afford the dental surgery he needed,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes As the bones in 69-year-old Barbara's jaw started to disintegrate, her teeth began to fall out. The public servant from Parkes, New South Wales immediately went to a specialist dentist, where she was told a combination of factors — including osteoporosis — meant she would need a full set of oral implants. The out-of-pocket costs totalled almost $70,000. Barbara, who does not wish to be identified with her full name, said she was forced to withdraw money from her mortgage offset account to cover the costs. ""I just had to deal with it, end of story. There wasn't a lot of other options,"" she said. ""But I thought 'what do other people do?'. What really hit home was the fact that there's so many people in Australia, whether they have private health insurance or not, who can't afford to do that."" One of those people is Michael Powell, 62, who lives near Ipswich in Queensland. Michael's teeth have been a major problem for the past decade, and he desperately needs teeth extractions and dentures. ""They have deteriorated over time with age and now I have less than eight teeth left to clean and have a basic meal at night,"" he said. Only a fraction of the population can access government-funded dental check-ups. It all comes down to money, and a decision made almost five decades ago. Despite having top-tier private health insurance when he was working full-time as a driver, he was unable to afford the $6,500 in out-of-pocket costs to fix his teeth. ""Considering I was making $120 net a day driving a cab or an uber — it was just outrageous,"" he said. ""I drove night shift because the difference between night and day was the fact passengers didn't have to look at my smile very often, because of my embarrassment of the way my teeth were."" Now on the disability pension, Michael has been on the waiting list for public dental care since 2020, and has been told it could be up to eight years before he gets help. ""It's very frustrating. I mean, your quality of life, your self-esteem; it would be nice to be able to smile without having to worry about showing all your teeth decay,"" he said. ""Your self-esteem is at an all-time low and it doesn't help with your anxiety or even depression."" Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the long-running dental divide between the rich and poor, and nowhere is that more apparent than among older Australians. A quarter of Australians over 75 have teeth affected by decay, while 20 per cent have complete tooth loss. Those who cannot afford out-of-pocket costs to care for their teeth have few options. Many Australians like Michael spend years on lists for public dental clinics, which are run by the states with help from the Commonwealth. Pressure has been steadily building on the major political parties to commit more money towards combating poor oral health among Australians, with Australian Dental Association vice-president Stephen Liew saying additional funding for the sector was long overdue. ""Dental care has been the canary in the coal mine of full body health in Australia,"" he said. ""There's no doubt. It is drastically underfunded, drastically ignored."" Dr Liew said the first step to addressing that would be a targeted senior benefits program for aged care residents. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese gear up for the third and final leaders' debate. That would fund basic dental services in aged care facilities, train staff so they can help with dental care, and include oral assessments in the over-75s health check performed by GPs. Dr Liew said while the policy would cost about $95 million a year, it was a small price to pay. ""We have stories of patients in aged care facilities with almost no teeth left, with abscesses, pus bleeding and discomfort to a level where they cannot be treated,"" he said. ""This is unacceptable in a country like ours."" The scheme was one of the recommendations of the royal commission into aged care, but has not been adopted by the Coalition. A $2.5 billion seniors dental pledge was one of the more ambitious policies Labor took to the last election, as part of a package of measures ultimately rejected by voters. Grattan Institute Associate Anika Stobart said while expensive policies are rarely palatable for voters, not funding aged care dental would also come at a cost. ""Because the mouth is connected to the body, we see higher risks for diabetes or cardiovascular issues if people don't address their oral healthcare needs,"" she said. ""This also puts pressure on the health system, people are more likely to go see GPs, and need pain relief, or end up even in emergency or get admitted to hospital for the most serious healthcare conditions. ""The waiting lists incredibly long for the state schemes — on average about a year — so you can imagine if you have a health issue with your teeth, you might put yourself on a waiting list, but then your issue gets exacerbated because you're waiting for so long, and it can degenerate and get even worse and may require further medical treatment. ""So it's really unacceptable, the current system that we have."" The Coalition argues dental and oral health are a key part of primary care, saying it is extending its agreement with the states to fund public dental for another year. Labor said it is committed to its ""long-term"" goal of expanding Medicare to dental health services but has not specified a time frame. Meanwhile, the Greens recently promised universal access to free dental care if it wins the election, with a $77.6 billion pledge over 10 years. For Michael Powell, that policy alone could be enough to sway his vote this coming election. ""Everyone seems to scoff at those things because of the cost factor, but at the end of the day, I know the Greens won't be in power, but they can influence things in a hung parliament or at least through the Senate,"" he said. ""I might be leaning that way just to get my teeth fixed.""

151,At risk of severe COVID-19? These medicines can 'save lives' — and they're available through your GP,health," Health For Australians at high risk of developing severe COVID-19, getting access to potentially lifesaving treatment recently became easier — but experts say some are still missing out. On May 1, COVID-19 antiviral drug Paxlovid — the most effective oral treatment to date — was listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), which means it can now be prescribed by a GP or nurse and dispensed at a community pharmacy. It's the second antiviral drug to be listed on the PBS for people at high risk of severe COVID-19, following the addition of molnupiravir (also known as ""Lagevrio"") back in March. Both drugs, while no substitute for vaccination, help head off the worst effects of the virus and reduce the risk of hospitalisation, said Royal Australian College of General Practitioners vice-president Bruce Willett. ""They don't cure COVID-19 completely, but they do decrease the severity of it, so they have a really important role to play in keeping people safe,"" he said. The addition of oral antiviral treatments to the PBS means that many high-risk Australians are now able to receive COVID-19 treatment at home, instead of in hospital. ""Before, we were sending our patients with a significant risk of developing severe disease into emergency departments to have intravenous medications,"" Dr Willett said. ""So this is really helping to get these medications to people, and to get them to people quickly."" Despite increased availability, Dr Willett said many high-risk Australians were unaware they could potentially access COVID-19 antivirals through their GP. ""We're still seeing lots of people dying from COVID-19,"" he said. ""So increasing awareness and increasing our ability to get these medications to people when they need them is going to really save lives."" Adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 — which is confirmed by a PCR or a rapid antigen test — can be considered for an oral antiviral treatment if they are: To be considered for treatment, patients must have at least one sign or symptom of COVID-19 (eg. fever, cough, or headache) and be able to start treatment within five days of the onset of symptoms. ""These [medications] are aimed at people who are at risk of getting severe symptoms and who are unwell, but who do not require hospitalisation or supplemental oxygen,"" Dr Willett said. Confusion over eligibility criteria and lack of public information is keeping lifesaving drugs from some patients, doctors say. Risk factors for severe disease — which are listed here — include being unvaccinated, living in residential care, having respiratory problems, heart failure, obesity, diabetes, and neurological conditions such as stroke and dementia. The list of immunocompromising conditions has been expanded to include conditions such as Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, as well as severe intellectual and physical disabilities. While not everyone will qualify for antiviral treatment, Dr Willett says it is ""certainly worth asking the question"" of your GP if you believe you're at increased risk. They will look at your individual circumstances, medical history, age, and vaccination status (including time since vaccination). You can also use the government's COVID-19 Symptom Checker or call the National Coronavirus Helpline, both of which will advise you of your eligibility, Australian Medical Association vice-president Chris Moy said. ""They will take you through the algorithm to work out not only if you should go to hospital or not, but also whether you're at risk [and therefore eligible for antivirals],"" Dr Moy said. Like all antivirals, Paxlovid and molnupiravir work best early in the course of an infection, which is why they must be taken within five days of symptoms appearing. Because of the short time frame, it's important to get tested for COVID-19 as early as possible, and if you return a positive result, to get in touch with your GP. ""In the past, there have been issues because people aren't aware of the medications, or if they are, they don't go through the process of getting a test and following through with a doctor in those five days,"" Dr Moy said. ""The hit rate has been quite low, although it's been improving, and hopefully will improve more."" GP practices are often busy or booked out, so make sure you let them know you are seeking COVID-19 antiviral treatment and that it's time sensitive. If you don't have a regular GP or are unable to make a telehealth appointment, Dr Moy recommends calling the National Coronavirus Helpline. ""They will give you some other options,"" he said. ""The critical thing is that you get advice about how you can get help."" If you qualify for treatment, it's recommended that you ask your pharmacy to arrange for the medication to be delivered to your home, or get someone to collect it on your behalf. ""There are still some issues around the country with availability in pharmacies,"" Dr Willett said. ""But as more people become aware … we're seeing pharmacies really ramping up their supply."" GPs are being discouraged from prescribing COVID-19 antivirals to people who are not eligible on the PBS, due to limited supply. ""We are being requested to restrict these medications for people who qualify to make sure those people who are at risk of developing severe disease are able to get them,"" Dr Willett. ""It's very difficult for GPs to bend the rules on this because of the short supply."" Clinical trials have found both oral treatments reduce the risk of hospitalisation and death. However, Paxlovid appears to be more effective — but is not always suitable to prescribe (more on that below). You just found out you're COVID-positive. Here are some things to think about that will help you get through it. The drug, developed by Pfizer, is made of two different antiviral medicines: nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir is a COVID-19-specific-drug designed to interfere with the virus's ability to multiply. Ritonavir — once used as a HIV/AIDS treatment — slows the body's metabolism so the medication remains active in the body for longer and at higher concentrations. A phase-three clinical trial of Paxlovid found it reduced the risk of hospitalisation and death by 89 per cent when unvaccinated COVID-19 patients were treated within five days of symptom onset. ""The problem is that you can't have Paxlovid if you have significant liver impairment or renal disease, so it really rules out a lot of elderly patients,"" Dr Moy said. ""It also has major interactions with commonly used medications like cholesterol tablets, so certain people just can't take it."" When Paxlovid isn't suitable, patients may be prescribed molnupiravir or sotrovimab (sold as ""Xevudy"") — a monoclonal antibody treatment given via intravenous drip. ""When molnupiravir first came along, initial effectiveness was 50 per cent, but then it dropped down to about 30-35 per cent effective,"" Dr Moy said. ""There is some new data coming out that may change that — some emerging evidence that it may be more effective than those initial numbers."" Sotrovimab was initially found to cut the risk of hospitalisation and death by 79 per cent, but emerging preliminary data suggests the drug may be less effective against the Omicron BA.2 variant. As noted by Dr Moy, Paxlovid is not recommended for people with severe liver or kidney impairment. It also has a long list of medications that it can't be taken with, including some common drugs used to treat hypertension, heart arrhythmias, arthritis, psychosis, and cancer, among other things. Both Paxlovid and molnupiravir are not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and it's advised that people of ""childbearing potential"" use contraception during the course of treatment (and for several days afterwards). While high vaccination rates mean the majority of Australians are well protected against severe COVID-19, Dr Moy said there were still many people who remained at risk, including significantly immunocompromised and undervaccinated people. ""COVID-19 is not a cold. It's a serious multi-system disorder which can, particularly in high-risk people, still cause them to end up in hospital and die,"" he said. ""With antivirals, we're trying to stop people dying, but also stop people getting sick enough to end up in hospital, and potentially end up with major long COVID as well."" Get the latest health news and information from across the ABC. Ideally, Dr Moy says, health authorities will soon be able to identify all high-risk individuals so they can be notified ahead of time. ""Then we can tell them they will need to get treatment if they get COVID-19, and expedite testing and so on."" He stressed that vaccination continued to ""beat antivirals any day"", but that drug treatments were a key part of Australia's COVID-19 armoury. ""The main emphasis should quite rightly be vaccination, because prevention is better than cure,"" he said, noting Australia's lagging booster rollout. ""But this is a great second stop.""

152,Perth residents warned to avoid calling ambulances for non-emergencies as St John buckles under ‘extremely high’ demand,health,"  St John has issued an unprecedented warning to Perth residents, that they are likely to experience delays in getting an ambulance owing to ""extremely high"" demand for its services. It comes amid an ongoing health crisis in the state that has seen ambulance ramping outside hospitals reach record levels and on the day WA recorded its highest ever number of COVID cases. It is the first time St John has directly appealed to the public about the dire state of its response times, as set down in its COVID escalation plan. ""At present, about 25 per cent of the St John fleet in metropolitan Perth is ramped, and the State Operations Centre is continuing to receive call volumes of more than 40 calls per hour,"" a St John spokeswoman said in a statement. She said those with non-emergency health needs should seek alternative support from Heatlhdirect on 1800 022 222, their local GP or urgent care clinic,  or the COVID hotline on 13COVID. ""Our priority is to provide care to Western Australians who require life-saving assistance,"" she said. Ambulance ramping is said to take place when a hospital takes longer than 30 minutes to admit a patient to the emergency department. WA recorded its worst ambulance ramping figures in history last year, with paramedics spending more than 52,000 hours waiting to hand over patients outside hospitals, the equivalent of six years, according to figures published by St John WA. It was more than double the 25,902 hours recorded in 2020 and five times higher than when the McGowan government took charge of the state in 2017. Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said hospitals had been asked to do all they could to help. “I am advised an unusually high volume of calls to the St John operations centre and high rates of staff furlough has increased pressure on the health system and St John,"" she said. “Anyone requiring urgent care should call an ambulance as usual, but as always, please save triple-0 for genuine emergencies.” Latest figures from St John show ambulance response times on Sunday were significantly behind target, with just under 70 per cent of the most urgent calls attended to within 15 minutes. The aim is to have at least 90 per cent of such cases attended to in that time frame. Of Sunday's urgent cases, about two-thirds were attended to within the target time of 25 minutes, again well behind the 90 per cent aim. March was the second-worst month for ambulance ramping on record, with the state recording 5,654 hours. However, just a week into May, ambulance ramping hours are already at 1,561 hours. If that trend continues, the figures could eclipse those of September last year, WA's worst month for ramping on record, when ambulances spent 6,526 hours ramped outside hospitals.

153,Queensland mine faces $5m lawsuit for alleged lead poisoning causing teenager's brain damage,health,"  Queensland's Mount Isa Mines faces $5m lawsuit over allegations lead poisoning caused teenager's brain damage The mother of a 16-year-old Queensland girl with an intellectual disability is suing mining company Mount Isa Mines for $5 million in damages, alleging her daughter's brain damage is the result of lead poisoning caused by emissions from the mine site. Bethany Sanders was 13 months old when her family moved to Mt Isa in April 2007, and lived in the suburb Soldiers Hill, less than three kilometres from the mine. A civil case that began at Brisbane's Supreme Court on Monday, heard at that time Bethany's mother, Sharnelle Seeto, knew nothing about the dangers of lead absorption in children and had not seen or heard any warning about the risk of children inhaling or ingesting dust or particle fallout from emissions. Ms Seeto's barrister, Gerard Mullins, told the court the mining city of Mt Isa in Queensland's Gulf Country was very dusty and, despite Ms Seeto's cleaning, dust regularly coated windows, floors and other surfaces in the family's home. At the time, Bethany was a crawling infant who would often play on the floor or in the yard, putting toys and her hands into her mouth. She was also prone to eating dirt – a sign of the eating disorder known as pica, which Bethany was later diagnosed with. The court heard that after five months of living in Mt Isa, the family discovered free blood tests were being offered to test lead levels in young children. Ms Seeto booked Bethany to be tested in September 2007. At 15.3 mcg/dL (micrograms of lead per decilitre of blood), Bethany's results were above the recommended limit of 10 mcg/dL. A second test in December 2007 saw her lead levels jump even higher to 27.4 mcg/dL. The court heard Ms Seeto then decided to leave Mt Isa with her children and returned to live in her parents' home at Kippa Ring in south-east Queensland. A 1993 document to Mt Isa Mine employees relating to lead exposure and its impact on children was revealed to the court. Mr Mullins pointed out that lead poisoning can have an ""intellectual and behavioural impact on the development of children"". The court was told Bethany had experienced severe developmental delays, lethargy and learning difficulties throughout her life and still lived with a cognitive impairment. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Other documents shown to the court revealed that in the 1990s, concerns over lead exposure led to the formation of a community health committee in Mt Isa, which urged a public health campaign after a sample of blood tests found a number of young children with elevated lead levels. Ms Seeto and her daughter Bethany Sanders are due to give evidence on Tuesday. Damian Clothier QC is representing the defendant, Mt Isa Mines, which is owned by global mining giant Glencore.

154,COVID reporting system crashes amid high demand as WA cases reach another record high,health,"  Western Australia has reported a new record in COVID-19 case numbers with another 10,394 infections. The state now has 58,640 active cases, with 279 people in hospital — down from 281 — and six in intensive care. No new deaths have been reported. The number of new infections is just over 200 more than the previous record of 10,182 reported last Thursday. The majority of the cases, 7,306, were recorded via rapid antigen tests, with the remaining infections confirmed via PCR tests. The spike in case numbers came as seven West Coast Eagles players were fined $5000 each for breaching the club's COVID-19 rules by going to a Perth nightclub. WA dropped the requirement for people to wear masks at almost all indoor venues on April 29. Since then, hospitalisations have steadily risen and new case numbers have twice reached new peaks in excess of 10,000 cases. WA takes a giant step towards living with COVID-19, as a whole raft of restrictions are removed. ABC medical expert and physician Norman Swan said the mask mandate should have been maintained in WA and other states for longer. ""The mask mandate is a cheap and effective way of slowing and controlling the viral spread,"" Dr Swan told ABC Radio Perth. ""It's a complicated issue and a difficult one. I do think the mask mandate should have been maintained in all states for some time to come. ""You do really want to slow this down and not have quite as much virus circulating in the community, because people are vulnerable and do get infected."" Not long after the latest figures were released, the Department of Health confirmed it was looking into a problem with its website for people to register positive COVID-19 rapid antigen tests. A message on the webpage told people they were ""currently in the COVID RAT Registration / Home Monitoring virtual waiting room"" and that it was experiencing a high demand for registrations, saying it may result in higher-than-expected waiting times. The department said high demand had created issues accessing the site's online registration form. ""We are asking people to either wait in the queue online, which should only take a few minutes, or to try the website later today,"" the department said in a statement. ""We thank everyone for their understanding."" Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson later said the problem had been resolved  and results were being uploaded again. Ms Sanderson said Chief Health Officer Andy Roberts was ""relatively comfortable"" with the increase in new COVID cases. ""I think what it's showing us is high levels of testing,"" Ms Sanderson said. ""He's relatively comfortable with the numbers as they are because the numbers that really matter are those hospital ICU numbers. ""Our ICU numbers have remained remarkably flat throughout this whole experience. And that's the pressure point. Those are the numbers we are watching."" Her comments came as she made a pre-budget mental health announcement, promising $47 million to support the recommendations of a ministerial taskforce on children's mental health. It was created in response to the death of 13-year-old Kate Savage in 2020, who died from critical injuries that she inflicted just moments after leaving an appointment with the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). A review of her treatment and care by WA's chief psychiatrist found she was let down by an under-funded and under-resourced mental health system. Ms Sanderson said there would be $18.5 million to employ 11.6 full time equivalent staff in the regions at CAHMS. There would be $12.9 million for more peer workers to help young people and $10 million for a virtual support service to support families on the waiting list for CAHMS services. As WA's COVID figure reached the new peak, the state government announced an expansion of its free rapid antigen test (RAT) program. More than 70 new locations are open across regional WA for close contacts with no symptoms to collect tests. People must verbally confirm they are a close contact to receive 10 RATs, and can also collect RATs for other close contacts in their household, up to a maximum of 30. Premier Mark McGowan said the additional tests would help reduce financial pressures on households, as well as limit the spread of the virus. ""The vast size of our state means those in the regions may not have the same level of access to supplies as those in the metropolitan regions,"" he said. ""The expansion of free RATs at more than 70 additional sites in the regions further supports people who are close contacts and can help meet their daily testing requirements.""

155,Elderly woman waits outside Adelaide hospital in cold for hours as Labor pledges to fund hospital upgrade,health,"  A 92-year-old woman has been forced to wait outside the emergency department of a hospital in Adelaide's north for two hours during last night's cold weather. Maureen Wortley's family called an ambulance for her after she fell just before a Mother's Day dinner last night. Her daughter-in-law, Lili Csongrady, said they waited for an hour after calling an ambulance, before calling back and being told it would not arrive until 4am or 5am. They then drove her to the Lyell McEwin Hospital, where she was told to wait outside after completing her rapid COVID-19 test. She posted a photo of Ms Wortley's situation in response to a Facebook post by Premier Peter Malinauskas about Mother's Day. ""This photo was sent to me just now outside the hospital under a carport/triage at 12 degrees Celsius, as there is no room inside to wait for medical help,"" Ms Csongrady wrote. ""This is the real pandemic. This is another total bureaucratic failure of the system and there is zero excuse."" She told ABC Radio Adelaide that Ms Wortley — the aunt of Labor MP Russell Wortley — waited for two hours outside because of confusion between staff about whether she had done a rapid antigen test and what the results were. ""She had already received her rapid test as soon as she arrived and then was left there to wait there for two hours,"" Ms Csongrady said. ""There were intern nurses that were then coming up not realising that she had a RAT done and then saying that she needed to have another one done multiple times."" Ambulance ramping was a key issue during the March state election, with Premier Peter Malinauskas and Labor promising to ""fix the ramping crisis"" mainly through hiring more paramedics. While promising to look into Ms Wortley's situation ""thoroughly"", Mr Malinauskas said it was not clear if ramping was at play in her case or down to strict testing requirements for COVID-19. ""I don't know if this is a function of ramping from what I've been able to establish this morning, but let me just be clear from the outset to both Lili and her mother-in-law, Ms Wortley, that this is not consistent with the standard that we expect in a first world country,"" he said. ""Plain and simple, it's not good enough."" He said a $58 million upgrade was promised for the hospital in 2017 — also under Labor — but had not been completed. Ms Wortley is still in hospital awaiting results from x-rays. Divisional director of critical care at the hospital, Penny Conor, said she apologised to Ms Wortley and her family. ""There was no considerable risk to anyone … so I probably wouldn't describe it as a substantial stuff[-up], but yes, we could have done better,"" Dr Conor said. She said changes would be made in response to the incident, including asking patients to wear N-95 masks instead of surgical masks and moving the triage practices inside to avoid the cold. Dr Conor said an extra nurse would also be engaged to support the rapid antigen testing process. She said the triaging process was done outside at the Lyell McEwin because of high COVID case numbers in the northern suburbs, paired with low vaccination rates. ""In our ICU now, we have more COVID patients than Flinders [Medical Centre] and the Royal Adelaide [Hospital] together,"" Dr Conor said. The Lyell McEwin Hospital is in the safe federal Labor seat of Spence but, south of Adelaide, in the marginal Liberal seat of Boothby, federal Labor has announced $200 million to upgrade the Flinders Medical Centre if it wins the election. The cost would be matched by the state government. The money would fund an extra 100 beds and upgrade the hospital's emergency department. The Premier said the pledge was significant. ""It is our second busiest hospital. It has the busiest emergency department in the state,"" he said. ""This would be a substantial boost to hospital infrastructure that helps reduce the ramping crisis."" The hospital's emergency department recently had a $40 million redevelopment under the former state government. Mr Malinauskas said that did not go far enough. ""Unfortunately, the former state Liberal government's expansion of the Flinders Medical Centre was only to the emergency department, and then they closed beds behind the emergency department, resulting in no net increase in beds,"" he said. ""What we need here is a genuine increase in capacity."" The federal Liberal Party said it had not spoken to the state government about upgrading the hospital. South Australian senator Simon Birmingham argued the promise showed the risks posed by a Labor government. ""If you're going to pay for this at the Flinders Medical Centre, then why wouldn't you pay for half of the cost of the Women's and Children's Hospital build?"" he asked. ""Why wouldn't you pay for every other hospital project right around Australia? So that's the huge exposure that Anthony Albanese has opened up.""

156,Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff tests positive for COVID-19 after attending JackJumpers match,health,"  Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff has announced he will isolate for seven days after testing positive for COVID-19. He said he woke with mild symptoms and tested positive via a rapid antigen test. ""Due to being fully vaccinated, including my booster, I am feeling well and will recover while working from home,"" he said. ""I encourage Tasmanians, no matter how mild, to stay home if you're feeling unwell and get tested. ""Please, remember the important COVID safe behaviours — wash your hands and sanitise, and cover coughs and sneezes."" Mr Rockliff attended the JackJumpers game in Hobart yesterday and met with SES crews and officials on Friday after parts of Tasmania were hit with wild weather. Tasmania today recorded 841 new cases of COVID-19, with 44 people in hospital. Seventeen of those are being treated specifically for the virus. There were no new deaths.

157,'That's when he would start taking risks': The vulnerability that led to AC/DC front man Bon Scott's death at 33,health,"  AC/DC frontman Bon Scott led a high-voltage life. But his friends say the singer's unglamorous death at age 33 was not a surprise He's Australian rock music's most iconic figure. After slogging it out through 15 years of touring, boozing and in-your-face performances, Bon Scott was on the cusp of international stardom with AC/DC. Then, out of the blue, he was found dead in a tiny Renault on a freezing day in London in 1980. He was 33. It was an inglorious end to a life lived in technicolour, one that has spawned countless books, articles and theories from fans and devotees around the world. I've read most of them in the course of researching tonight's Australian Story episode on the enigmatic singer. However, the story that most rings true to me is told by a 75-year-old in a wheelchair in the Adelaide working-class suburb of Largs North. Health problems have prevented Bruce Howe from playing his beloved bass guitar for the past seven years. But, in the early 1970s, he was Bon Scott's housemate and the undisputed leader of Fraternity, the art rock band that Bon sang — and played recorder — with before joining AC/DC in 1974. Bruce Howe's voice catches with emotion as he remembers his old friend's biggest vulnerability: boredom. ""That's when he would start taking risks, doing wild things,"" Bruce says. ""On days when he was bored, there was no future, there was only now. ""He didn't give a bugger about whether he lived or died the next day. He'd try anything — magic mushrooms, marijuana, alcohol – and he would take risks on his motorbike."" Bon's top priority was always the band, always looking forward to the next show and doing everything he could to make sure it was a cracker. But if there were gaps in the schedule, no shows for a few days or, God forbid, a few weeks, he'd get restless. And the risky behaviour would rear its ugly head again. Bruce remembers catching a ride on the back of Bon's motorbike after a big night in Adelaide's Lord Melbourne Hotel, zooming around corners so fast that their boots were almost scraping on the road. The experience so terrified him that he swore never to get on Bon's bike again. He gave the High Voltage singer a heartfelt warning to cut back on the booze. ""I said, 'You are going to f***ing kill yourself. Do something about it!'"" Bruce tells Australian Story. ""I just couldn't understand why he didn't really care about everybody who loved him. We all knew that this wasn't going to end well."" In May 1974, after a fight in an Adelaide pub and a bit to drink, Bon was almost killed in a horrific motorbike crash that left him scarred, toothless and in hospital for weeks. When Bruce heard the news, he was too angry to even visit his mate in hospital. ""I just couldn't believe that I was right, that he was going to hurt himself badly, if not kill himself,"" he says. ""Thank God he didn't."" Bruce Howe's sentiments are echoed by Bon's brother, Derek Scott. In the first interview he's ever given about his famous sibling, Derek told Australian Story there was pattern to Bon's behaviour. ""He did get bored very quickly,"" says Derek. ""That was the biggest problem. When he got bored, he drank. ""He never worried about tomorrow. Tomorrow is another day."" Derek is speaking with Australian Story at his spotless home in Fremantle, WA, not far from where the Scott boys grew up in the 1960s. The family moved from Kirriemuir, Scotland, in 1952 to seek a new life in sunny Australia. Bon, or Ron as he was christened, was five years old at the time. ""My mother used to call him Ronnie,"" Derek says. ""So it was Ronnie Scott from Bonnie Scotland. ""It wasn't until he started in the band that they broke it down to Bon. In the family, we always called him Ron."" Music was in the family, with Bon's father ""Chick"" playing bagpipes and Bon picking up the drumsticks at an early age. In 1962, as members of the Fremantle Scots Pipe Band, they performed together at the opening of the Empire Games in Perth. Bon's friend Lynn Prior, who met him as a teenager, says he was very quiet one-on-one, but when other people were around, he was always a performer. ""He enjoyed the cheekiness of it all,"" Lynn says. ""He wanted to be the centre of attention, he loved being the centre of attention."" Derek Scott puts it down to Bon's small size. He was always feeling the need to prove himself. But at 16, Bon Scott had a run-in with the law and was sentenced to 12 months at the Riverbank Juvenile Detention Centre in Perth. An article published in March 1963 in The West Australian lists an (unnamed) 16-year-old youth pleading guilty to charges of ""giving a false name and address to police, escaping legal custody, having unlawful carnal knowledge, and stealing 12 gallons of petrol"". Surprisingly, Derek Scott believes that Bon's time at the juvenile detention centre was probably the best 12 months he ever spent. ""It not only taught him a little bit of responsibility, it settled him down,"" he says. ""While he was in there the others were playing guitars, so they formed a band, and when he came out he had a direction."" He joined a band called The Spektors, playing covers of all their favourites, with Bon on drums. Singer Vince Lovegrove, from the rival band The Winstons, suggested they join forces and form a new band, The Valentines, with Vince and Bon sharing the singing duties. ""Bon was the better singer out of the two of us,"" says Vince, in an interview recorded in 2004 (he died in 2012). ""The unspoken word was that if we did anything that required a bit more vocal range, then he would sing lead and I would sing harmony."" The Valentines became hugely popular in Perth but broke up in 1970 after being busted for marijuana possession. Bon was immediately snapped up by Fraternity, a musically ambitious band that went on to win the biggest prize in music at the time, the Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds. First prize was $2,000 cash and a return trip to Los Angeles by ship. But Bon's conviction for drug possession and his misdemeanours as a youth meant he couldn't get a visa for entry into the United States. So the band headed for England instead. Not long before they left, Bon married his girlfriend of four months, Irene. Why the rush? Because Fraternity's management would only pay the fares for wives, not for girlfriends. Arriving in London with an entourage of 17 people and their own bus shipped over from Australia, they soon found that getting gigs was harder than expected. Bon likened it to ""bashing your head against a wall"". ""We got a house, 20 people in one house, and we played gigs that cost us twice as much to play as we got paid for,"" he said in a 1978 interview in Atlanta. In the words of Fraternity's Bruce Howe, they very quickly realised they were the wrong band at the wrong time. While waiting for gigs, Bruce coached Bon on how to become a more dynamic performer. At the time, he barely moved around the stage, hugging the microphone stand like it was a security blanket. They even studied the local TV newsreaders, practising how to look straight down the barrel of the camera to keep people's attention. ""Bon was like a sponge, learning and taking and grabbing bits to make his craft better, and Fraternity was where Bon learned to be a frontman,"" says his old friend Jimmy Barnes. But after two years of struggle in the UK, Fraternity had to admit defeat. Bon returned to Australia, broke up with Irene and got a job at the Wallaroo Fertiliser plant on the Port Adelaide docks. For the first time in 10 years, he didn't have a band and he thought his dream of becoming a rock star was over. After the motorbike crash, which came a few months later, he worried that he wouldn't be able to get up and sing again. ""His problem was that he was 27,"" says Bon's brother Derek. ""He knew most people were finished by the time they were 28, 30. It was Bon's former bandmate Vince Lovegrove, by this time working as a promoter in Adelaide, who suggested he try out for a hot new band called AC/DC. Vince had heard that AC/DC's leaders, Angus and Malcolm Young, were unhappy with their then-singer, Dave Evans. When Bon got up to sing a few tunes with the band at a pub in Adelaide, he was nervous about the age gap. Manic guitarist Angus Young was still in his teens. ""I was really shitting myself,"" Bon said. ""Here's me, a man 27 years old, there was him, about 18 at the time. ""And I thought, 'Can I keep up with this guy? My God, he's going to kill me!'"" But as soon as Bon started jamming, Angus Young knew they had found their new frontman. ""I think from the moment he got on stage he was just one of those people that had that presence,"" Angus told the ABC in a 1998 interview for the Long Way to the Top documentary series. ""So we more or less asked him if he was looking for a gig."" When AC/DC played in Sydney a few weeks later — with Bon on vocals for the first time — Fifa Riccobono from the band's publishing company, Alberts Music, was sent to check him out. She thought he was rough and rude – but perfect. ""He had a tooth missing, he had tattoos all over him,"" Fifa tells Australian Story. ""He was loud, he was cussing, but he just fitted in so well with the band it was ridiculous."" Within months, they were in the recording studio, where the band became known for their high-energy performances, playing as if there were 10,000 screaming fans in the small room with them. And then the following year, along came Countdown. If ever there was a band that was tailor made for the new ABC youth music show, it was AC/DC. It was a chance for Bon to try out his new, more extroverted stage persona, and his new skills in working with a television camera. ""They would absolutely thrive on the atmosphere of having the audience there, touchable, only a few feet away,"" says Paul Drane, producer/director of Countdown from 1975 to 1977. ""Bon just ate up television. He was made for it."" By 1976, AC/DC had gone as far as they could in Australia and set off for London. From the start, it had been their vision to go out and conquer the world, and for Bon it was a second shot at overseas success after the failure of Fraternity. AC/DC spent the next three years performing and touring relentlessly, building up an audience first in Britain, then in Europe and finally tackling the American scene. By the time the Highway to Hell album came out in 1979, everything was falling into place, according to Murray Engleheart, author of the book AC/DC Maximum Rock and Roll. ""Within the next 12 months, they were expected to be one of the biggest acts on the planet,"" Engleheart says. ""The next album was going to be the one that was really going to kick them over the goal posts."" But friends were starting to notice a change in Bon's state of mind when he came back to Australia each Christmas. He was drinking a lot, even by his standards. He seemed lonely and told one old friend that he'd been looking to buy property in Perth, not far from where his parents lived. The last time Fraternity's Bruce Howe saw him, Bon was hinting that he wanted to settle down and have children. ""Maybe he'd come to the stage where he'd achieved his dream, he'd found his holy grail, but the holy grail might have looked like an empty goblet,"" Bruce says. Back in London in early 1980, the band set to work in the recording studio. Angus and Malcolm Young were working on guitar tracks, and Bon was told he wasn't needed for a few days. It meant Bon was vulnerable to his biggest weakness — boredom. ""That pattern of getting bored and restless, for him that was excruciating,"" Bruce says. To relieve the boredom, he called some friends to go drinking with, and they drank way too much. That night one of the friends, Alistair Kinnear, drove Bon home but Bon passed out along the way. Alistair then drove them to his own home, but again couldn't rouse Bon. He threw a blanket over Bon in the car and went upstairs to bed. The next day, Bon Scott was found dead in the car. A coroner found the rocker had died of acute alcohol poisoning and death by misadventure. ""Bon's passing as he did, on his own in a car in the freezing cold, after all his hard work and all his heartbreak getting there, was just an incredibly sad, lonely and unglamorous way to go out,"" Murray Engleheart says. It was February 19, 1980. For years, Bon had always rung his mother on her birthday, February 18th. But this time when the phone rang, it was AC/DC's Malcolm Young. ""[Mum] thought, 'Oh, Ron's ringing me to say happy birthday,' which he often did the next day because of the time difference,"" Derek Scott says. ""Malcolm didn't have time to explain because it was hitting the airwaves and he didn't want them to hear it on the radio. So he just said, 'Ron died.'"" For his old friend Bruce, the news was heart-wrenching but unfortunately not surprising. ""He drank far too much,"" Bruce says. ""I did wonder if he would push it too far one day. And sadly, he obviously did."" Friend and former Young Talent Time host Johnny Young's view is that Bon had just wanted to go home and be with his family. Unfortunately, he went for the bottle instead. As it turned out, it was Bon's parents who urged the remaining members of AC/DC to continue the band. Bon would not have wanted them to give up. Within months, they had recruited as their new lead singer Brian Johnson, who Bon had met and admired while in London with Fraternity years before. AC/DC's subsequent album, Back in Black, became the second-best-selling album in music history, and the group remains one of the biggest rock acts in the world. Meanwhile, four decades on, Bon's legend has only grown. His grave in Fremantle has become a kind of shrine to the iconic singer, regarded by millions as the ultimate rock music frontman. ""He was the best rock and roll singer I've ever seen,"" Cold Chisel singer Jimmy Barnes says. ""To this day, I don't think there's a rock and roll singer in the world that can hold their own against him."" For Brian Johnson, Bon Scott remains an inspiration, not just for his singing but for his cheeky sense of humour. ""When I hear him talking in old interviews, I still laugh, even if I've seen it 20 times,"" Brian says. ""He was a special guy. I wish I had got to know him more. But I didn't,"" he says, ruefully. ""But that's life."" Watch Australian Story's On the Brink on iview and Youtube.

158,What the 'new normal' for Sydney's workers could look like after COVID-19 pandemic,health,"  If it were up to Tony Colaco, he would never go to work again. The 59-year-old chartered accountant has spent the last two years working in his Greystanes home and has no intention of heading back to the office in Parramatta where he is employed by the Department of Education. “I am saving time, money, my health is better and my social life is better,” he said. “I have team members who used to travel in from Newcastle and the Central Coast every day, and now I find everyone is more fresh, ready, and energised when we have meetings."" Mr Colaco is one of a growing number of people who have created a ""new normal"" of flexible work arrangements, adding to a shift away from city centres. Data collected by Google since the beginning of the pandemic shows movement around the centres of Parramatta and Sydney is unlikely to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Last month in Parramatta there was a 34 per cent drop in people heading into the office compared to early 2020. NSW hit a first-dose vaccination rate of 95 per cent in December last year, leading to a seven-month high in foot traffic. However, by April those figures have not improved — despite fewer restrictions and a higher vaccination rate at 96.2 per cent — and those advances have not translated to an increase in activity. Mr Colaco is fine for this to become standard. “Nothing is suffering,"" he said. “I used to spend three hours stuck in Parramatta traffic and now that time is given back to me, which I can use to learn new skills for my job.” In Parramatta’s centre, cafe owner Liza Chehadie has reason to be concerned. Her business — which moved 10 weeks ago due to Parramatta’s Metro rail construction — relies on foot traffic from the nearby train station and office buildings. Fewer workers are using public transport, which means fewer customers. In Parramatta, commuters are down 23 per cent, and the city is plateauing because about 34.3 per cent fewer people head to stations and bus stops. “I try to be positive and put positive vibes out there. I know I should be worried, but we weathered COVID and came out the other side,"" Ms Chehadie said. Retail and recreation movement are also trending downwards in both cities. Sydney has yet to recover from a record 80 per cent slump in retail activity during the Delta lockdown. Ms Chehadie’s business was open for six months before the July restrictions. “We managed to get a reputation and get good return customers in that short time,” she said. “I hope that’s enough to keep us going because I’m doing this for the love of it.” Big businesses are rethinking what a future workplace looks like. Parramatta’s Deloitte staff are now all working flexibly. The international consultancy firm is in the middle of redesigning a new office space at 8 Parramatta Square, where it will lease one and a half levels. That move — which began in earnest 12 months ago, and has been in the planning stage for two years — has evolved to factor in a reduction of staff on site. ""If we were designing this space before the pandemic, it would look totally different,” managing partner Helen Hamilton-James said. ""We did have a conversation about whether we even need an office but, ultimately, it was about redesigning what work will look like and changing mindsets about how we work most productively.” Deloitte will move its 330 Parramatta-based staff into the 55-storey tower in November. “I think it’s important for teams to be together from time to time, to collaborate,” Ms Hamilton-James said. “We probably would have needed more space before COVID, and we would have a totally different desk set up and meeting space."" Ms Hamilton-James, who works remotely part-time, said other companies needed to catch up. “We’re the shining beacon in a way for Deloitte since we’re the first branch to make a move post-COVID. “You can’t really hark back to the days before working from home, employees will vote with their feet and choose to go somewhere that offers that flexibility.” See our full coverage of coronavirus We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

159,I wasn't prepared for parenting when my wife and I both got COVID. Here's what I learned,health,"  Here's the scene: you and your other half tested positive for COVID a few days ago and, as you ride out the peak of the infection, you can barely lift your head from the pillow. Then your baby starts crying. My wife and I experienced this moment recently when we were both suffering from COVID-19. When you're in the thick of it, COVID can be quite scary. My wife had already done most of the childcare that day. It was my turn. I dragged myself out of bed to attend to our youngest daughter, who is only 10 months old. It hurt and it was painful, but my basic instincts kicked in: If I wasn't getting up, how would our child be cared for? After a few hours I had to go back to bed and my wife got up to look after the baby and our eldest daughter who is four. We kept up this tag-teaming routine for the next 24 hours as our symptoms started to subside. COVID-19 has presented us with enormous challenges – from lockdown and working from home, to home learning for our children — and to a large extent we've overcome many of them. But the coronavirus threat has not gone away. Vaccinated or not, Australians are still getting sick and national daily case numbers remain in the tens of thousands. Yet have you ever asked yourself this: What happens if both parents are sick with COVID-19 and unable to care for their kids? Or worried about passing it on? What resources are available to parents facing this situation? Chiang Lim, chief executive of the Australian Childcare Alliance, worries about the toll the pandemic is having on single parents in particular. ""In some families, particularly those of single parents and those with limited or no family support, have struggled to care for their children when they have been diagnosed with COVID-19,"" she says. Once I had sufficiently recovered from my COVID illness, I called the NSW Government's 1300 hotline for advice. But a COVID call centre operator told me there was nothing practical he could have offered. As parents of dependent children, when COVID struck, we were on our own. From the moment your child is born there's a lot of work to do: Changing nappies, feeding, settling to sleep, laundry... it goes on and on. In many families, once the child is six to 12 months old both parents return to work and drop their children off to day care or pre-school. And there's usually a grandparent or even an uncle or aunt who can step in if something unpredictable happens. But help is not so easy to come by when COVID strikes. How is COVID-19 affecting children's development and how can parents best deal with it? You're forced into isolation. If family support is available many older family members are wary of being in contact with potentially infected children and may decide to stay away (or their children want to keep them away from the risk). If both parents are in bed with a fever, chills and fatigue, and are unable to move, you have a problem. Until recently even uninfected family members were required to isolate for a week. Rule changes in NSW and Victoria last month meant children in those states are now allowed to return to school or childcare as long as their RAT is negative. However not all states have moved to looser rules. Depending on where you live around the country, you may also receive a phone call from your state or territory government checking up on you and offering guidance on where you can get help. But what if the assistance required is just basic childcare? You're probably on your own. The commonsense advice from various parenting websites is to plan ahead. WIRED, for example, suggests you war game the scenario ahead of time: I wanted to write about this experience because when it happened to me, I was caught off-guard. I was shocked I hadn't thought through the scenario and figured other families may be in the same situation. Fortunately, because my wife and I didn't get too sick, we fumbled our way through it. But it was close. So how many families are experiencing a similar scenario right now? How many are not coping? It's impossible to know. The website Raising Children told the ABC it is simply too early to get a sense of the scale of the problem. It's playing out before our eyes. The NSW COVID call centre operator I spoke to said he hadn't received many calls from families looking for childcare help as caregivers battled COVID. But that makes sense to me: In the thick of my symptoms I certainly didn't have the energy or presence of mind to wait on hold for assistance. There's an old saying in medicine that you need to worry about the patients that aren't complaining. But notwithstanding the availability of vaccines and variants that produce milder symptoms, the fact is that COVID-19 remains a threat. And many families are suffering in silence.

160,'The solution is simple': Ad campaign urges South Australians to get vaccinated against COVID,health,"  The South Australian government is launching a $2 million advertising campaign to encourage people to receive a third COVID-19 vaccine, as authorities report another five people with COVID have died. About 72 per cent of eligible South Australians have had their third dose. Health Minister Chris Picton said the campaign was targeting the remaining group. ""That still means there are 28 per cent of those people who have had two doses who haven't come forward yet to have their third dose,"" he said. Premier Peter Malinauskas said the state's hospital system remained ""under a lot of pressure"", and being fully vaccinated was one way of avoiding hospitalisation. ""You don't want to be the person who is only double-vaxxed, ends up getting COVID, and then finds themselves on a ventilator in our hospital system wishing they had had a third dose,"" he said. Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said the ""science was absolutely crystal clear"" that three doses of the vaccine were required, even in people who have previously had COVID-19. ""I'm very keen to go away from talking about boosters because it's not a booster; the course is actually three doses for Omicron,"" she said. ""It's a different variant … it's not Delta, and it's 100 per cent Omicron in our state so it really is three doses [that are needed]."" Professor Spurrier said the percentage of South Australians who were fully vaccinated had not budged for some time. ""Every day I look at it, hoping it's going to go up, but it has just stayed the same,"" she said. The state recorded 2,788 new COVID infections today and five deaths of people with COVID, ranging in age from their 60s to their 90s. Professor Spurrier said there were 214 people in hospital, including nine in intensive care. ""As we lift restrictions, we will expect to see more cases in our community, and what we are really focusing on is people being protected and not ending up in hospital because it is preventable,"" Professor Spurrier said. The number of active cases in the state has continued to decline to 21,386. Professor Spurrier also said flu vaccination rates were ""not as good"" as at the same time last year. ""Obviously we are concerned that people who have flu, or COVID, or have them both together, will get really sick and end up in the Royal Adelaide or one of our other hospitals,"" she said. ""And that's not good for them, and that's not good for our hospital system as well."" Mark Plummer, the head of research and innovation at the Royal Adelaide Hospital's intensive care unit, has joined the state's vaccination campaign. He said he saw regret in under-vaccinated or unvaccinated patients ""daily"". ""What I would implore you to consider is your family,"" he said. ""What we are getting sick and tired of is having to speak with families at the bedside and dealing with the regret of not having been fully vaccinated. ""It's a shocking situation. ""The patients are on a ventilator. They can't speak for themselves. They're unconscious. So that grief is held by their family and that regret is held by their family if they haven't been fully vaccinated."" Dr Plummer said there was a ""huge over-representation"" of partially vaccinated or unvaccinated people in the intensive care unit. ""The solution is simple,"" he said. ""We are so lucky to have a vaccine developed in the space of time … so I implore you, please get your third dose."" Dr Plummer said complacency was evident in all age groups, including in high-risk patients. ""There's a lot of misinformation out there and unfortunately a small minority have a very loud voice on social media and can change the message from what is very clear; that this is a very serious disease and that vaccines work,"" he said.

162,Native Americans have lost the guardians of tradition to COVID. Now the younger generation is taking the reins,health," Coronavirus One of the fondest memories Shemah Crosby has of her grandmother Lena is the time they spent together hand crafting Choctaw Indian traditional dresses, sewing elaborate appliqués onto colourful fabrics. When her ""pokni"", the Choctaw term for grandmother, died of COVID-19 in the early months of the pandemic in 2020, the 20-year-old student lost not only a beloved family member but a wealth of knowledge about her Native American tribe, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. It was a wake-up call for Crosby, who began playing a more active role in her community, learning the tribe's language as well as ancient practices like beading and dress-making. Last summer, she won the Choctaw Indian Princess pageant, becoming her tribe's official ambassador for the year. ""I truly was going to be the one to kind of sit back,"" she recalled on a recent afternoon as she stood in front of a large wooden cross the tribe has erected on the shores of Lake Pushmataha, a reservoir on the Choctaw reservation in Mississippi, in memory of those who died of the virus. ""But now, because time is precious, I feel I have to take that role, to be the teacher."" As the death toll from COVID-19 in the United States nears the 1 million mark, members of the tribe are trying to cope with the devastation caused by the virus, which knifed swiftly through their community, killing scores and leaving few families untouched by death. The death toll included many Choctaw tribal elders, storytellers, musicians and artisans who were the keepers of traditions that have shaped the tribe's history and culture for centuries. COVID-19 has taken a disproportionate toll among Native Americans due in part to widespread chronic disease in their communities and the historic underfunding of Indian healthcare systems. As of early May, 130 Choctaw in the Mississippi reservation had succumbed to the virus, according to local health officials, a per capita death rate of 1,300 out of every 100,000 residents. That is three times higher than the state average, according to a Reuters tally of public health data. Mississippi leads the nation in deaths per capita. Indigenous communities across the globe have suffered a disproportionate negative impact from the pandemic which laid bare long-standing inequalities and exacerbated challenges including poverty and access to healthcare, experts say. By attacking the elderly, COVID-19 threatened the very essence of native people — their traditions and languages of which the elders were the guardians. From Latin America to Canada, tribes moved to shield their culture keepers as much as possible, barricading villages and prioritising the elderly for vaccinations. Still, many died carrying with them their people's knowledge. The Mississippi tribe is no stranger to extreme hardship. In the early 19th century, the Choctaw tribe was the first of the Indian nations to be driven from ancestral land in the south-east of the US by the government. Thousands died of starvation, illness and exposure to the elements on a 805-kilometre journey on foot to what is now Oklahoma after then-president Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act. Today, Oklahoma is home to the largest Choctaw community in the country, followed by Mississippi. Crosby, an anthropology student, is not the only member of her tribe who wants to preserve the tribe's traditions after it lost so many custodians of its culture over the past two years. Mag Willis, 35, said the pandemic inspired her to create a Facebook group for Choctaw artisans where people could connect with the crafters, watch tutorials, and buy pieces such as beaded sandals, elaborate necklaces and colourful earrings. ""I think there's a lot of people [who are] starting to realise, 'Hey, I think I need to learn',"" said Willis, who lost her grandfather, one of the tribe's fiddle players, to COVID-19. Lakeishia Wallace, 34, began learning beadwork after leaving the US military more than a decade ago and struggling to find a job. The pandemic made her realise the importance of sharing skills, like how to create intricate bead sets and sew ribbon skirts, traditional clothing with colourful strips sewn onto them. With many in the community wary of meeting in person, the mother of four recently posted a tutorial on Facebook on how to make a traditional beaded necklace. Now, she said, she is working on a series of instructional videos and hopes to publish them across multiple social platforms. ""It's my turn to step up, my turn to get all that knowledge and pass it on,"" she said. It is hard to find someone in the tight-knit Native American communities scattered across 10 counties in eastern and central Mississippi who has not lost family, friends or acquaintances to the virus. Jeremy Bell lost many members of his large family over the past two years and buried two of his cousins on the same day. ""When you lose the first five you're going to cry, but it got to the point where I got desensitised,"" Bell said. ""I quit counting after 30."" Death not only up-ended his family life but also crept into his work. Bell, who manages a bus transportation network on the reservation, said he saw his drivers struggle with the loss of many long-time passengers. ""It was just overwhelming to the point that when I left I shut the door, locked it, turned off the lights and I just sat there and cried,"" he said. In the tribe's multi-generational households, it was hard to implement COVID-19 mitigation measures like isolating a sick family member. Tribe members were made even more vulnerable by the prevalence of diabetes, obesity and respiratory disease in their community. The arrival of COVID-19 vaccines was met with hesitancy by many in the tribe, where the vaccination rate remains stubbornly low at just above 48 per cent, which is below the national average of 66 per cent fully vaccinated. On the Mississippi reservation, budding hope about a post-pandemic future can't hide the deep scars left by the pandemic. In his Pearl River office, the tribe's chief, Cyrus Ben, sits behind a wooden desk that is framed by two flagpoles, with the American Stars and Stripes on one side and the Choctaw Nation's banner on the other. COVID-19 not only led to loss of life, but ""we lost pieces of our culture,"" Ben said, weeping at one point during an often emotional interview. ""There's going to be a void for quite some time,"" he said.

163,Sydney researcher who lost son to SIDS makes breakthrough in preventing 'every parent's worst nightmare',health,"  Sydney researchers find enzyme marker to help detect babies at higher risk of SIDS A marker that could help identify babies at a higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been discovered by Sydney researchers. The study conducted by The Children's Hospital Westmead confirmed what had long been suspected — that SIDS victims were unable to wake themselves up — but it went one step further by providing the why. The enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) plays a major role in the ""brain's arousal pathway"" and was found at ""significantly lower"" levels in babies who die of SIDS. ""Babies have a very powerful mechanism to let us know when they are not happy,"" Lead researcher and Honorary Research Fellow Dr Carmel Harrington said. ""Usually, if a baby is confronted with a life-threatening situation, such as difficulty breathing during sleep because they're on their tummies, they will arouse and cry out. ""What this research shows is that some babies don't have this same robust arousal response. ""Now that we know that BChE is involved, we can begin to change the outcome for these babies and make SIDS a thing of the past."" Public health campaigns focusing on safe sleeping, overheating and maternal smoking during a baby's first three months have reduced the incidence of SIDS. However, the children's hospital says death rates remain high. ""There is this perception that SIDS isn't a problem anymore or that the problem can be solved if all babies had the correct sleep conditions, but two children still die from SIDS in Australia every week,"" said Professor Karen Waters, the head of the children's hospital SIDS and Sleep Apnoea Research Group. It is hoped the finding could lead to the development of a screening test in a few years' time. Hailed as a ""game-changer"" to ""every parent's worst nightmare"", the discovery of BChE also provides answers to parents, like Dr Harrington, whose healthy babies died ""on their watch"". ""These families can now live with the knowledge that this was not their fault,"" she said. ""My son, Damien, died suddenly and unexpectedly one night. It took me about two years before I could really take a breath again, and at that point, I thought I actually want to find out why he died. ""Nobody could tell me. They just said it's a tragedy. But it was a tragedy that didn't sit well with my scientific brain."" That was 29 years ago. Since then, Dr Harrington has dedicated her life to finding answers and funding, which has also involved setting up the crowdfunding campaign Damien's Legacy in honour of her ""beautiful little boy"". The study, published in The Lancet, analysed dried blood spots taken as part of the Newborn Screening Program. The blood was analysed after deaths from SIDS and other causes, and each one was compared to 10 surviving infants. Attention will now focus on using the findings to develop targeted interventions. ""This is the gift that I feel I got for Mother's Day because the timing of this is really peculiar to me, that it's coming on Mother's Day,"" Dr Harrington said. ""This gives us a focus for our future research. So there's quite a lot to be done. We need to understand the system better … We know what we have to do. It's just actually getting the funding for it.""

164,"After being severely stressed at work, Christian's body became paralysed but his mind stayed active",health,"  How Christian McDonald survived locked-in syndrome, which left him trapped inside his body in ICU It was like being buried alive at the beach with only a straw sticking out of the sand to breathe through. That's how 48-year-old Christian McDonald remembers spending weeks in hospital completely paralysed, unable to breathe on his own. He was conscious but could not speak nor communicate in any way, not even to open an eyelid nor raise an eyebrow to connect with the health workers caring for him. But over time, lying on a bed inside Cairns Hospital's intensive care ward (ICU) with a ventilator breathing for him, he learned to differentiate one nurse from another — and one doctor from the next — by their voices. And the distinctive sound of their footsteps as they walked into and out of the room. The father of five had developed what is known medically as ""locked-in syndrome"" or Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a rare neurological condition with various causes. In his case, doctors diagnosed severe Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an auto-immune disease where the immune system attacks the nerves. Essentially, after a prolonged period of severe work stress, Mr McDonald's body turned on itself, causing gradual full-body paralysis. For 31 days, he was completely locked in, his mind trapped inside his body, severed from the outside world. The experience was so frightening Mr McDonald described it as ""beyond a nightmare"". He tells of frequent bouts of breathlessness despite being on a ventilator, his locked-in state making it impossible for him to alert his medical team to have the machine turned up. ""The breathing was a monstrous issue, just basically trying to stay alive — it's like you're suffocating multiple times a day,"" Mr McDonald said. ""You're constantly just counting your breaths all the time, trying to keep on top of your anxiety — you do a lot of praying."" Mr McDonald first sensed something was not quite right after a day out jet skiing with his sons at Lake Tinaroo, near their Atherton Tablelands home, in late January 2020. He struggled to help his boys haul the jet skis back onto the trailer. That night, as he sat on the couch at home, he realised something was seriously wrong. ""I felt really off — I was losing a lot more strength at that stage and starting to struggle lifting my arms,"" he recalled. ""I said to my wife: 'I need to go to the emergency department to find out what's going on.'"" It would be months before Mr McDonald was well enough to return home and more than a year before he was back on his feet, taking a few tentative steps again. He spent much of 2020 in Cairns Hospital's ICU, most of that time on a ventilator. But it was his weeks of being locked-in, unable to even grimace to indicate when he was in pain, that took the biggest toll psychologically. Routine physiotherapy sessions to stretch his legs could be so excruciating painful, it felt like his muscles were being ""torn off the bone"". ""Some of the painful experiences I had in hospital — I'd never known anything like it,"" Mr McDonald said. ""To the point where your brain goes into a white haze and you physically can't think — the pain is so extreme you pass out, basically."" Unable to open his eyes, Mr McDonald could not orient himself to his surroundings, sometimes feeling as if ""I was sitting on my head"", his mind playing tricks. ""I'd never know what was up or down,"" he said. ""They'd move me every few hours. I knew they'd rolled me, but half the time it felt like they'd rolled me through the bed and the next minute, I was up on the roof and the next time I was sitting on my head — it was so disorientating."" His only reassuring tethers to the real world were the calming voices of his wife of 24 years, Tamara, other members of his family and hospital workers talking to him as he lay in bed, unable to respond, like a living mannequin. Apart from relaying her conversations with his doctors, Ms McDonald — herself a nurse — said she would often speak to him about the weather and what was happening in the world, including COVID-19, which was only just emerging when he was admitted to hospital. ""We told him about the toilet paper issues,"" she said, with a laugh. ""When he could talk, he just couldn't believe that people were having fights in the supermarket over toilet paper."" Ms McDonald, who wrote a daily diary during her husband's illness, joked that she sometimes found it convenient that ""I could talk to him and he couldn't say anything back"". But as her laugh faded, she added in a sombre voice: ""Most of the time, it was terrible. My favourite word when people would ask me: 'How are you going?' was to say: 'Coping.'"" ""It was a highly emotional time in our lives — it's still pretty raw for both of us."" Seemingly mundane, one-sided conversations with hospital staff became therapeutic for Mr McDonald as he lay motionless in bed. ""There was one doctor who used to come past when he started work every morning,"" he said. ""He'd give me a news report. He'd just say: 'Half the world's going stupid'. ""Even when he wasn't looking after me he'd still drop in and just say hello."" Mr McDonald said there was a nurse ""who used to walk past and have a quick chat as well"". ""She'd just tell me what was going on in her life and what was going on with her family,"" Mr McDonald said. ""Then off she'd go again. They made the point to stop in whenever they could."" He said he could not speak highly enough about the staff. ""It's not a job for them, it's a passion,"" Mr McDonald said. ""They were just so concerned and so caring — it just blew me away,"" he said. ""It made it actually a lot easier — being able to communicate with me from the caring side made a huge difference to trying to cope — it helped me to deal with it all. ""How we treat each other is so important — we're all connected, we're definitely all connected."" Mr McDonald's belief in a higher power also guided him through the toughest of days. While not a devout churchgoer, he credited his faith in God with keeping him focused on hope at a time when many would have given up. ""I do strongly believe throughout the whole entire time, I had the option whether I wanted to be here or not,"" he said. ""I chose to be here — the power of positive thinking to me is extremely important. There's a lot that's in your control."" After almost five weeks of being completely locked in, a highly observant nurse noticed Mr McDonald had regained slight movement in his left eye. It was no more than a slight flicker to the left, but it was enough to enable the nurse to hold his eyelid open while she read out letters on an alphabet board, allowing him to select letters using a sideways movement of his eye. His first message after so long of not being able to communicate was practical rather than profound: ""bowels full"". From there, he slowly regained muscle function, finally going home in a wheelchair after spending most of 2020 in hospital. More than two years on, Mr McDonald was walking again although ""not anything like I used to"". ""I've still got issues with my feet and legs, but I'm getting around a million per cent better than I was 12 months ago,"" he said. Cairns Hospital's ICU director Drew Wenck said the ICU treated about two cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome a year but rarely as severe as Mr McDonald. ""Most Guillain-Barre cases are nowhere near that bad,"" Dr Wenck said. ""They might not be able to breathe but they can usually move their arms a bit, or their legs a bit, or they can move their mouth. ""They can often mouth words, they can lip-read and things like that. ""It's very unusual to be that severe to not being able to communicate. ""Usually there's some finger movement or some head movement or something like that, whereas in Christian's case, the paralysis was extremely profound — it would have been awful for the poor man."" While Mr McDonald said he believed the Guillain-Barre syndrome was triggered by extreme stress in his case, Dr Wenck said the Cairns Hospital medical team had been unable to identify a cause. Dr Wenck said bacterial infections such as campylobacter, or viruses, including influenza, had been linked to the condition. ""What initiates it, what causes it, what turns it on and turns it off, are still areas that are subject to research,"" Dr Wenck said. Mr McDonald's ability to articulate his recollection of the locked-in experience to his ICU team after he emerged from the paralysis resulted in his case being reported recently in the prestigious British Medical Journal. ""It helps the world understand these patients and how we should treat them,"" Dr Wenck said. In January this year, almost two years after he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome, Mr McDonald lost his 20-year-old son Luke, who drowned after he hit his head at Emerald Creek Falls, on the Atherton Tablelands. The grieving dad said his locked-in experience was helping him cope with his son's death. ""We still miss him like crazy — we talk about him all the time, but we've come to terms with it as much as you can,"" Mr McDonald said. ""My experience in hospital has given me a totally different perspective on death and dying — I know it's nothing to be fearful of — a higher power is looking after us."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. As he deals with the family's tragedy, consulting a psychologist this year to talk through the impact of the past two years, Mr McDonald remains grateful for life's simple pleasures — enjoying the wonder of the sunrise or watching a tree move in the wind. Every so often, he returns to the Cairns Hospital ICU to the people who helped him through one of the most difficult times of his life. ""When we go in there, it's like going back to see family,"" Mr McDonald said.

165,Coalition marks Mother's Day with election pledge to help cancer patients conceive,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Cancer patients and Australians at risk of passing on genetic diseases to their children will receive Medicare rebates to subsidise the costs of egg, sperm or embryo storage as part of a $53 million Coalition election pledge that also funds additional postnatal care. The federal government is capitalising on Mother's Day with an announcement designed to appeal to Australians who want children, promising to cut the costs of Medicare-funded assisted reproductive technology services for 6,200 eligible Australians a year if it wins the election later this month. Scientists can identify if Australians are at a high risk of passing on a genetic condition to their children by using a technique called preimplantation genetic testing or PGT, which examines embryos for chromosome variations or specific genetic conditions. To maximise the chance of a healthy baby, chromosomally healthy embryos, or those unaffected by a genetic disorder, are identified and selected to be either stored or implanted during an IVF cycle. The Coalition is pledging to spend $14.4 million to help subsidise the storage costs to preserve embryos for 2,000 of those Australians. It is also pledging to give 4,200 cancer patients a year access to Medicare rebates to store embryos, sperm and eggs to help preserve their fertility, which can be affected during illness or treatment. All up, it will save eligible Australians about $600 a year. The Coalition is also promising it will spend $25 million over four years delivering 20 perinatal mental health and wellbeing services around the country, run by the Gidget Foundation and collocated in centres like the Head to Health hubs. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he wanted to help Australians who needed it most, after using IVF to conceive his children. ""For people battling cancer or staring down the risk of genetic diseases, it's already a difficult battle and this new subsidy will help give them more options about their aspirations to become parents,"" he said. ""Right when these aspiring mums and dads need help the most, we'll be there."" Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said on Sunday Labor would match the Coalition's commitment, describing the additional financial support for those dealing with cancer as ""commonsense"". ""Where the government comes up with a good policy, we are prepared to support it,"" Mr Albanese said. Meanwhile, Mr Albanese will start Sunday morning in Sydney after spending Saturday in the marginal Tasmanian seat of Bass, where he announced $20 million for clean energy projects and jobs at a campaign rally. He used his speech to the party faithful to ramp up attacks on Scott Morrison over Coalition action on climate change. ""What does it take to give some of these numpties a wake-up call to tell them climate change is right here, right now?"" he said. Both leaders have been honing in on marginal seats during a weekend that has been light on new policies but heavy on local announcements. They will close the fourth week of the campaign facing off in a televised debate hosted by the Nine Network, kick-starting a frenetic fortnight of campaigning with both sides targeting the undecided voters ahead of the May 21 election.

166,"'I get paid more to pour drinks': Support for aged care worker pay rise, Vote Compass shows",health,"  Carlton Williams works in aged care but he has to work a second job to make ends meet. He lives on Queensland's Sunshine Coast in home care during the day and bartending at night and on weekends. ""I get paid more to pour drinks, take out food and wait tables than look after someone's life,"" Mr Williams said. ""One lady I know earns $23 an hour. She doesn't want to quit because she says 'who will look after these people', but she's on bugger all money."" Australians overwhelmingly want the federal government to increase pay for workers in the aged care sector, according to ABC Vote Compass results. One of the recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety last year was for better wages in the sector. Vote Compass results show 82 per cent of Australians agree or strongly agree the federal government should fund a pay increase. There is majority support when we look at voting intention too, although Labor and Greens voters are more likely to strongly agree with the position. And when we look at the age breakdowns, Australians aged 65 years and older show 87 per cent support and 95 per cent for the 50- to 64-year-old age bracket. The Health Services Union and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation have brought a case to the Fair Work Commission, arguing for a 25 per cent increase. Given the aged care sector is mostly funded by the Commonwealth, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Fair Work decision would be honoured by whoever wins in May. But he has not made it clear who would pay for it, leaving open the option of a cost-sharing arrangement with the sector. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, on the other hand, says a Labor Government would advocate for and fully fund any wage rise awarded to aged care workers by the Fair Work Commission. Dr Peter Chen teaches politics at the University of Sydney and says there is a ""staffing crisis"" as well as the issue of low pay. ""We're looking at roughly 200,000 workers who are looking to get a fairly significant increase,"" Dr Chen said. ""We're talking billions of dollars for the federal government to pay that."" Vote Compass has also asked if Medicare should offer basic dental care for all Australians. 91 per cent of Australians agree or strongly agree. That proposition has gained support over time. Dr Chen says an increase in awareness about dental care has helped drive the increase. ""There's been a lot of good, solid health science coming out that says we've neglected our teeth at our peril,"" Dr Chen said. ""Your teeth can actually have a big impact on the rest of your health. The public is starting to see the logic of that argument.""

167,SA records two COVID-linked deaths as AMA warns of viral 'cake' effect on hospitals,health,"  There have been another two COVID-linked deaths in South Australia, which today reported 3,304 new infections. The latest fatal cases were two women aged in their 90s, SA Health said. There are 214 people in hospital with the virus, including 13 people in intensive care and one on ventilation. The latest caseload total is about 450 more than yesterday's figure, but coincides with a 35 per cent increase in PCR testing. There are currently 21,535 active cases in the state. At the same time it added the latest fatal cases to the state's COVID death toll, SA Health also removed several cases ""Following further investigations, three previously reported COVID deaths have re-classified as died from other causes,"" SA Health said. Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier this week urged flu vaccination uptake ahead of what has been predicted to be the most severe flu season since the start of the pandemic. ""Particularly our youngest children — the babies — have not been exposed to any flu because we haven't had any over the last couple of years with the borders shut,"" Professor Spurrier said on Tuesday. Australian Medical Association (AMA) vice-president Chris Moy today reinforced that messaging, saying overseas estimates suggested about ""about 1 or 2 per cent of people"" will catch both flu and COVID-19 at the same time. ""There's a study that shows there's about a doubling of the death rate on top of COVID for people who catch it at the same time,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""It's extra reason to get the flu shot. The flu shot is the really, really key thing for us this year. ""Earlier this week, we were at about 3.2 million people who had the flu shot. Last year we'd had about 3.8 million. That's a concern because I think there's just a bit of vaccine fatigue out there at the moment."" South Australia's flu vaccine rollout has been boosted by ""hundreds of pharmacies"" taking part in the national immunisation program for the first time, the SA government said. ""Pharmacies offer a convenient option to many patients who want to get the vaccine in a way that best suits them,"" Health Minister Chris Picton said. According to SA Health data, there have been 371 reported influenza detections in the state so far this year. ""Pharmacies are well established in providing vaccines and continue to play a key role in protecting the public against COVID-19,"" SA Health communicable disease control branch director Louise Flood said. ""This expansion will only build on that public confidence and allow them to join GPs in helping boost flu vaccine rates, which will help save lives."" Dr Moy said he expected the number of hospitalised COVID-19 cases to remain between 200 and 250 over the coming months, but the impact of such a number on the state's hospital system should not be underestimated. ""That's basically a third of the Royal Adelaide Hospital,"" he said. Dr Moy likened the impact to a layer cake, saying COVID-19 would put extra stress on a health system simultaneously battling influenza. ""If you think about what normally happens in winter, we get full hospitals,"" he said. ""It's like a cake — we get our normal [cases] we have to look after, then on top of that we have the flu — so that's why the hospitals become so full and ramped up — and then on top of that we're going to have this extra third of the Royal Adelaide Hospital [filled with] people with COVID. ""We need to stop that cake, if I can put it in terms of people ending up in hospital being too high, because that's the real worry at the moment."" The SA government today reported a slight reduction in ramping in April compared to March, saying SA Ambulance Service figures showed a 2.9 per cent decline.

168,"National autism strategy in the pipeline, with both Coalition and Labor committing to plan",health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Australia is set to develop a national autism strategy regardless of who wins the federal election — a move that has been welcomed as a ""good start"" to changing community attitudes to children and young people with a disability. Earlier this year, a parliamentary committee that examined the services, support and life outcomes for people with autism recommended the establishment of a national strategy. Social Services Minister Anne Ruston announced on Saturday that the Coalition would commit $1 million towards a strategy over the next 12 months if re-elected. It would be aimed at providing better access to services, increasing awareness and helping people into work. Labor has already announced it would develop a national autism strategy if elected, as part of its broader policy on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Senator Ruston said one in every 30 school-aged Australian children were on the autism spectrum, and many of those children experienced loneliness, isolation, exclusion and discrimination. ""This comes at an enormous personal, social and economic cost to these Australians and their families,"" she said. ""For too long, people on the autism spectrum and their families have been left to navigate services to cater for their needs. This strategy will help better integrate services that change lives. ""The sooner that we are able to provide [parents] with the relevant supports to help them and their children, the better the life outcomes for those children, the better the life outcomes for those families."" The Coalition's strategy would investigate how to better integrate federal and state autism services, and consider a public education campaign to portray the diversity of the autism spectrum, and improve inclusion in schools, workplaces and the community. It would also look to identify workforce gaps and shortages, and would include reporting mechanisms on the social inclusion of people with autism in the community. Mary Sayers from Children and Young People with Disability Australia said strong government investment was needed to change community attitudes. ""Children and young people with disability face discrimination and exclusion across many elements of their lives especially in their education,"" she said. ""While this announcement is a good start, we need investment for all children and young people with disability. That's why we have called for a national inclusive education plan for all students in our election platform."" New South Wales Liberal senator Hollie Hughes chaired the parliamentary committee and said an additional $1.3 million would go to the Autism Cooperative Research Centre. ""From diagnosis through to adulthood, we want to provide the right supports for the 200,000 Australian people with autism,"" Senator Hughes said. Labor's Tanya Plibersek said it was important to do whatever was possible to support families with children with autism. ""I speak to parents of children with autism a lot, and the most common thing they tell me is they struggle … to get their children recognised by the National Disability Insurance Scheme,"" Ms Plibersek said. ""It is heartbreaking to talk to parents who have had expert report after expert report about the supports that their children need, only to be turned away by the National Disability Insurance Scheme, to have packages cut. ""Labor will always support more help for kids with autism, for their families, through the NDIS, through the school system. ""In any way that we can take some of the pressure off those families, we're up for it.""

170,Kids' sport may fail to get across the family budget line as cost of living soars,health,"  Kids' sport may fail to get across the family budget line as cost of living soars Australians love their sport, but as families try to rein in their day-to-day costs, extracurricular activities are being booted and forcing more children to sit on the sidelines. Almost $13.5 billion was spent by Australians on fees for participation in sport or physical activity over the past year. More than $3 billon was spent on fees for children's participation in sport, and more than $10.4 billion for adults. That is compared to $2.3 billion for children and $8.4 billion for adults in 2016. The average cost to participate in sport is about $970 per year, with more than half of that chewed up in basic membership costs, a recent AusPlay survey found. With fuel, grocery, and other living expenses going through the roof, parents are reconsidering spending money on their children's organised sport. Leah Cooper's two teenage daughters Lalitha and Elainia are talented netballers in Mitchell in south-west Queensland. They pay at least $1,790 a season in combined membership and representative fees, and necessities like shoes, but have made their uniforms last as long as they can. Saturday game fees are extra, and then there are the travel costs, which for regional Australians are nothing unusual. The nearest, higher standard competition is in Roma about an hour away, so the increase in fuel prices has left the Coopers feeling the pinch. ""It's representative netball, as well as the Saturday school netball in Roma. So not only are we travelling away to carnivals, but we're also going into training, which is an hour away, a two-hour round trip,"" Ms Cooper said. ""I think the last carnival we attended was a Toowoomba carnival, and that was when the price of fuel just skyrocketed. So it was over $200 just to get down to Toowoomba and back, which is crazy. ""It's not only fuel, but also the running cost of the car as well. The more kilometres you do, the more services you need to do to keep the car up to scratch. ""We've said to the girls that they may not be able to do some of the carnivals, or some of the activities, just because of the travel costs."" Ms Cooper's burn in her hip pocket is also being felt at the club level. A survey by the not-for-profit Australian Sports Foundation in September last year found about 50 per cent of clubs were seeing a decline in membership due to financial burden. The president of the University of Southern Queensland Football Club, Tiffany Burstow, has seen the strain on club members. ""I've had a few families approach us about the issue, with deciding whether to even register,"" Ms Burstow said. ""I had a new family come and one of their big deciding factors on whether they were going to register their children for sport was how many away games they would have to go to because of the cost of fuel. ""We have had a fair few families ask us about payment plans because of the costs of working out the registration fee all in one go."" The Australian Sports Foundation's survey found the biggest decline in participation was among children aged 11 to 18. CEO Patrick Walker said the dropout rates were alarming. ""The big concern is that they've dropped out of sport, and at that age group they're much less likely to be physically active and engaged in sport later on. That's obviously creating health problems,"" he said. The long-term ramifications are serious. One in four children and adolescents aged 2-17 were overweight or obese, according to 2018 statistics by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). ""Physical activity has a direct link to physical health and obesity levels,"" Mr Walker said. ""Participation in sport is not only the physical activity, but it's the engagement in community, playing with your friends, having fun with your friends, which is so good for mental health."" Governments around Australia are trying to reduce the disparity between the haves and the have-nots when it comes to participation in sport. A report by Sport Australia in 2018 found 58 per cent of children from low income families participated in sport, compared with 84 per cent of children from higher income families. New South Wales has an Active Kids program which provides two $100 vouchers for parents, guardians, and carers of school-enrolled children to use towards sport and recreation costs each year. To be eligible, applicants need a Medicare card. The Queensland Government offers FairPlay vouchers up to $150 per child to help with the cost of membership or registration fees. The eligibility criteria says a parent or guardian needs a valid Services Australia health care card or pensioner concession card. Those who are not eligible, like the Cooper family, are doing what they can to cut costs. ""We try and carpool as much as we can. I try and pack lunches for the carnivals so we're not having to buy food there at the canteen,"" Ms Cooper said. ""If we can stay with family wherever we go, we try to. ""It all adds up."" The University of Southern Queensland Football Club is recycling equipment for members who need it most. ""Soccer boots, because of the supply, have been a lot harder to come by, and because of that they also have gone up quite significantly in price,"" Ms Burstow said. ""We've started a little program where we've got people who drop in their old soccer boots, and then we're able to pass those on and donate those to families who are struggling to afford boots for their kids."" Patrick Walker said despite everyone's love for sport, it remained severely underfunded. ""More needs to be done, but it's certainly good to see some of the state governments stepping in,"" he said. ABC Southern Qld will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

171,How parkrun turned Chris Murphy into an Australian ultramarathon champion,health," Sport How parkrun helped turn Chris Murphy into an Australian ultramarathon champion Not so long ago, Chris Murphy was unfit, unmotivated and stressed out. He was working long hours and couldn't find the time to exercise or relax. Then he was hit with myocarditis — a disease that causes inflammation of the heart muscle. Things got harder. Just walking up stairs was a challenge. ""I'd have to take a breather halfway up,"" the 38-year-old said. It slowed him down for a good two years, and he became frustrated by his lack of fitness. ""After a couple of years of taking it easy with that [myocarditis], I decided I needed to get a bit of fitness back,"" Murphy said. ""And then between the poor lifestyle, drinking, stress, and a desk job, I'd put on a few extra kilos than what I was happy with."" Despite never being a runner, Chris decided to give it a go after consulting his cardiologist. ""I started off just running around the block,"" Murphy said. But those first 10- to 15-minute runs weren't easy. ""To be honest, I'd have to have a couple of days off because I'd be a bit sore and tired,"" he said. But he persisted, and soon bumped into someone who told him about parkrun. ""It sounded so good, so I registered, printed my barcode and turned up,"" he said. Eventually parkrun became a habit, and his gateway into the world of competitive running. It was July 2016 when Chris first lined up at parkrun. His local is Airlie Beach, one of more than 400 locations across the country. He's now clocked up 124 runs and has volunteered 29 times. ""The first few times I did 5ks it was pretty tough,"" Murphy said. ""During the week I'd run a bit more in the hope I'd go a little bit faster or be more comfortable at the next parkrun. ""But once I got into it, parkrun was that gauge every week to see if I was improving or not."" And he was. Every couple of weeks, he would record a new personal best. It's what kept him going then, and what keeps him motivated now. ""It was that internal competitiveness, that's what's driven me the whole way through,"" he said. ""Seeing that progress was a really good driver."" And it also made him curious as to what else his body could do. After enjoying parkrun, Murphy decided to ""see how far I could push things"". He did a few 10km training runs, and then decided to enter a half marathon. He did better than expected, so signed up for three more. That led to joining the Whitsunday Running Club, where he received guidance about his technique, motivation and confidence. When the club organised a 28-kilometre trail run, Murphy was quick to sign up. ""It was hot, it was long, it was hilly, it was hard, and it really hurt — but I enjoyed it,"" he said. Next, he tackled the UTA 100 – a 100-kilometre trail run in the Blue Mountains – which he admits was way outside his comfort zone. He trained hard and expected a 16-hour finish, but smashed that time to finish in just over 14 hours. He claimed a bronze buckle for his effort, but that didn't quite cut it for the fierce competitor in him. He returned a few months later to try for silver — and got it. The theme of setting goals and achieving them was well and truly set. As the goals became more and more ambitious, it was time to bring in a coach. Murphy has been working with Chantelle Robitaille for the past three years. She says his positive disposition really helps when he's struggling, or when a race or training block doesn't go to plan. ""Ultras are 50 per cent physical and 150 per cent mental,"" Robitaille said. ""Competitors need to be well-trained going into these events, but the longer they are on their feet the longer they will encounter challenges like heat, cold, altitude, chafing, sleepiness, hallucinations, GI distress and pain."" She says the key is being able to stay positive, keep moving forward, eat and drink on cue and deal with issues when they come up. 2020 was a tough year, with COVID affecting parkrun and so many other events. But Murphy was still keen to push himself further, so he thought outside the box. He discovered Backyard Ultra. ""That type of race just got me curious,"" he said. It's a form of ultramarathon where competitors consecutively run 6.7-kilometre loops in under an hour. Once you've finished the loop, you rest for the remainder of the hour. ""Each hour is like its own individual run,"" Murphy said. ""So, if you finish in 45 minutes, you've got 15 minutes before the next run. And then the next hour you go again,"" he said. ""It's just relentless until everybody else gives up."" In his first Backyard Ultra in Brisbane, Murphy came third. He ran for 30 hours and covered 201 kilometres. That got him an invitation into the Australian Backyard Ultra Team, to compete in a satellite World Championship eight weeks later. ""I just thought I'd turn up, hang out with these guys and learn a thing or two,"" Murphy said. He ended up winning the Australian event, running 308 kilometres in 46 hours. He came away as the Australian champion, with a new Australian record and a ranking of 17th in the world. That win got him a place at the pinnacle of Backyard Ultras in the United States, where he vied for the world championship. He was happy with his effort of 41 hours (275 kilometres) and 13th place, but the ultimate goal is to go back and do better. ""I want to get back there against the best in the world and give it another crack,"" he said. Murphy's running has come a long way since his first parkrun, back in 2016, with five kilometres no longer the challenge it once was. Despite the run no longer fitting into his training plans, he and his wife Nicole and kids Calvin, 8, and Rose, 5, continually turn up at Airlie Beach. ""Running isn't really the reason I go to parkrun anymore,"" he said. It's the people that get them back week after week. ""It's just a really good environment and community that we love being a part of,"" Murphy said. And it's provided a good deal of inspiration to push himself to the limit. A pretty good effort for a guy who struggled to run around the block, right? ABC Sport is partnering with parkrun to promote the benefits of physical activity and community participation.

172,HIV is no longer a 'death sentence' but new infections are soaring in the Pacific,health,"  HIV infection rates are declining globally but for Pacific women and girls, it's a different story For millions of people around the world, isolation has become synonymous with COVID-19. But in the early 1990s, Fijian woman Jokapeci Cati spent six months at home, unable to face the world, amid a global pandemic of a different kind – HIV/AIDS. Just 22 years old, Ms Cati had tested positive to the virus. ""I wasn't ready to tell anybody,"" she said. ""It was really a tragic moment because there was no support group, there was no awareness and the community was not sensitised."" Despite having the support of her family, Ms Cati said the early days of knowing her positive status were defined by a sense of loneliness. ""There were tears and emotions involved because there wasn't any information celebrating that you can live a normal life even though you're HIV-positive,"" she said. ""Back then, no-one had come out public in Fiji to say, 'Hey I'm Fijian, I'm HIV-positive and it's OK because you can live a normal life.' ""It was like a death sentence; knowing that you were HIV-positive had a connotation of death, no future and you cannot live a normal life."" Much has changed since then. HIV can be managed through antiretroviral medication that suppresses the amount of HIV in the body and allows people to live long and healthy lives without passing the virus on. Since her diagnosis, Ms Cati has worked tirelessly to improve outcomes for HIV-positive Pacific Islanders, and in 2007 she remarried and went on to have three children. ""I've been living with HIV for more than 20 years and I know without treatment I wouldn't have survived this long,"" she said. ""It's really important [for HIV-positive people] to hear testimonies of those who have lived with HIV and are celebrating life, treatment and having relationships."" While rates of new infections and AID-related deaths have more than halved because of treatment options, some disturbing trends have emerged.Of the estimated 37.7 million people living with HIV in 2020, 53 per cent were women and girls, according to UNAIDS. Just four years earlier, figures from UN Women showed young women aged between 15 and 24 made up almost 60 per cent of all new infections globally. UNAIDS country director Renata Ram said this was especially concerning for Fijians. ""Fiji in particular has seen a 116 per cent increase in new HIV infections since 2010 and almost doubled [the number of infections] in the 15- to 24-year-old age group,"" she said. ""Last year during the lockdown period, six babies were born with HIV. This is worrying when other countries with high HIV prevalence have zero mother-to-child transmission."" So if antiretroviral treatment is free and available and infection rates are declining globally, what is driving new infections among women and girls? According to Ms Ram, an uncontrolled sexually transmitted infection (STI) epidemic, unsafe sex and under-resourced HIV testing programs are to blame. ""In Pacific Island countries we suffer from a high burden of sexually transmitted infections but the prevalence over time is not well known,"" Ms Ram said. ""With HIV, you may only detect it when a person becomes very sick or if they get routine testing, which is not really happening now,"" she said. Under previous donor funding arrangements, Ms Ram said a comprehensive HIV and STI control program was implemented regionally but was not continued beyond 2014. As a result, fewer women and girls have been screened for sexually transmitted diseases in recent years, and if they do not get tested, they cannot get treatment. Hilda Wayne talks to the inspirational women on the frontlines of the fight against HIV in the Pacific region. ""Donor priorities have shifted to other emerging issues without fully addressing the HIV and AIDS situation in the Pacific,"" she said. ""Ten years ago, we had a robust HIV and STI program but now it's unheard of and people think HIV has left this region, but it's not the case."" According to the UN, teenage girls and young women are vulnerable to contracting HIV due to intimate partner violence and a lack of sexual and reproductive health information. Ms Ram said married women were also vulnerable to HIV because of the unequal power dynamic between men and women when it came to negotiating condom use. ""Some men do not prefer to wear a condom and women do not have the negotiating power in terms of wearing condoms and protecting themselves from HIV,"" she said. For women and girls to get help, they must be able to talk about what is happening to them. Ms Ram said ending the silence around sexual and reproductive health in the Pacific was key. ""Talking about sex is also a very taboo subject in the Pacific due to this conservatism, so our awareness campaigns can be very challenging,"" she said. ""We have antiretroviral treatment … and for anyone in the Pacific, this is free of charge once a person enrols into the treatment program. As for Pacific leaders, Ms Ram said the region desperately needed greater and sustained funding from donors to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic through education and testing. ""One of the key things [to implement] is the comprehensive sexuality education package in school curriculums,"" she said. ""It is about empowering young people to know about themselves, their sexuality, how to treat people and about diseases."" ""There is this perception that HIV is a death sentence, but it is not. It should be viewed as a chronic disease like high blood pressure diabetes, where you take medication daily.""

173,"'No man's land': After 18 months of seeking help, Laura Jane's stuck in the bottleneck of the mental health system",health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Eighteen months after she entered ""a very dark space"", Laura Jane Picone says she still hasn't received any help. Ms Picone, 28, said she fell into a deep depression at the height of Melbourne's lockdowns in 2020. The social isolation caused by losing her job, living alone and being unable to see friends took its toll. ""I didn't see any light at the end of the tunnel, to be quite frank,"" she said. Ms Picone said she called Lifeline, hoping to be referred to a psychologist, psychiatrist or even a counsellor. She was added to long waiting lists, and the process was further delayed when she moved from the city to the country for a few months, and experienced domestic violence. ""I felt like I had spread myself pretty thin trying to contact numerous places for help, and I wasn't getting any results,"" she said. Ms Picone now is back at work in Melbourne and optimistic about her future, but still had ""some things I need to work through"". Ms Picone's case typifies the bottleneck many experience when trying to enter the mental health system. Possibly worse, however, is what leading youth psychiatrist Patrick McGorry calls ""the missing middle"". These are patients who haven't reached a crisis point yet, but have complex, prolonged needs that require a level of expert care. ""It's the no man's land between primary care and specialist or hospital care,"" Professor McGorry said. ""About half to two-thirds of young people are in that category, but they just simply cannot get through to that next level, because it has not been built around this country."" Professor McGorry, the director of research institute Orygen, said he was disappointed mental health had not featured more prominently in the election campaigns of the two major parties. ""It's pretty much radio silence so far,"" he said. In 2019-20, more than 4 million Australians received mental health prescriptions, and state and federal governments spent $11 billion on services — with about a third coming from the Commonwealth. In the 2020-21 budget, the federal government promised an extra $2.3 billion over four years for suicide prevention and early intervention programs, mental health treatment and bolstering the workforce. A further $650 million was promised in the budget released in March. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog A Labor spokesman said the party would honour those budget commitments if it was elected. On the campaign trail, Labor has also promised to reverse a federal government funding cut for bulk-billed telehealth psychiatry sessions for people in regional and rural areas. Anthony Albanese said the program would support 450,000 consultations over four years and cost $31 million over the forward estimates. Meanwhile, the Coalition has been providing details on how it plans to spend money it had allocated towards mental health in previous federal budgets. This week, youth mental health organisation Batyr was announced as one of the beneficiaries, receiving $3.8 million in funding. Professor McGorry said the budget promises were ""a good starting point"" but the need for overall care was ""clearly not being met"". He said without adequate mental health funding there would be ""a lot of unnecessary deaths from suicide, futures lost and a weakening of the economy."" Melbourne psychologist Irene Robertson said her clinic had closed its waitlist for months, as staff worked through a growing volume of family break-ups and children experiencing anxiety and depression. ""There aren't enough clinicians to see the number of clients that are in need,"" Ms Robertson said. ""I feel like the effects of this pandemic will be seen for many, many years, especially for those that have lost businesses or completely disengaged from school."" For some already in the system, receiving ongoing treatment can also be a challenge. Brisbane woman Gabrielle Webster, 61, has battled bipolar disorder for three decades, a condition that she said cost her two marriages and relationships with her son and friends. It had also limited her ability to hold down a job in line with her university qualifications. Ms Webster, a disability pensioner, works part-time as a cleaner to afford monthly health insurance payments of $250, private psychiatry sessions and the 13 tablets she takes each day.

174,"Amid all the shouting, there's a perplexing gap in our election conversation",health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes One of the truly perplexing things about this election campaign is that, of all the things that we are talking about, or shouting about, few relate to the issues that have most reflected our suddenly intimate relationship with government amid a global pandemic: issues like the state of the health and hospital system, the aged care system or the disability support system. These were all found to be wanting during the pandemic. There are two royal commissions either completed or underway. There has been at least one state-based inquiry into what went wrong with the quarantine system. Yet no one really seems to know what is going on in any of these sectors on a day to day basis, or how to fix them. There are the obvious blame games about politicians' decisions during the pandemic. But how much discussion has there been about what the pandemic has revealed about the gaps in the way any of our human services are delivered? None. Why is that? Well, it's complicated. But let's argue it is because our politicians actually don't know what is going on because almost all of these services — except the state-run hospitals — are run by contractors. This is particularly true in aged care and disability care. But it is also true in employment services (helping people get into jobs). We talk a lot about the problems that exist as a result of having several layers of government in Australia. And there are occasional scandals involving an operator in a particular sector or even a group of them. But it's been a long time since anyone in politics actually said, ""Hang on, we as politicians (and therefore the voters), don't really have any direct line of sight, or accountability, on what happens in these most vital of services"". The care economy is now one of the fastest growing parts of the economy; it is the sector which is forecast to generate seriously large numbers of new jobs, yet we know very little about how it is structured or who actually runs it. That is, actual government services to people, is one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy. But we don't talk about it because it lives in some limbo land between ""the government"" and ""the private sector"". Do we have to actually rethink the way the whole system works? Contracting out became fashionable in the 1980s and 1990s when everyone was desperately trying to look like they were reducing the (apparent) size of government. The belief that the private sector always did things better was holy writ. But it has become a low farce as time has gone on. Politicians have some half-life, or muscle memory, that this is ""what you do"". While the government claimed Queensland's heath system was coping with COVID-19, Caroline Ingerson says she saw ""a system that was completely broken"". But there have to be questions now about how efficient these arrangements are in either a financial or outcomes sense. As taxpayers, we don't know all that much, for example, about what the structure is of the industry that delivers aged care or disability services. Anecdotally, people in those sectors — and in the public service which now largely exists to run the contracts — will admit that governments increasingly want to just have a few large operators running things for them, having thousands of small operators who you have to deal with and regulate is a drag. That creates a sultry swamp for the gradual build-up of oligopolistic, or at least not very competitive, markets. It provides the breeding ground for corruption and conflict of interest. If you build up just a few operators up over time, the relationship between government and operator is eventually going to get unhealthy. For the government, it is reliant on that service provider to run a large slab of the system. For the provider, they have an enormous amount of capital invested in the presumption that their services will continue to be required. The risk is that governments eventually write contracts, or even design funding, to prop up service providers, not because it will deliver outcomes to taxpayers. We have seen examples of this in the past in employment services and more recently in aged care. Almost three years ago to the day, this column documented how the Morrison government had announced a $320 million ""investment"" in aged care when it was under pressure from shocking revelations about the sector that had appeared on the ABC's Four Corners program. The way the funding was announced implied it was going to add ""$1,800 per permanent resident"" to the subsidy provided to each resident ""to deliver quality aged care services"". But in fact, this announcement of one-off funding actually just went straight to the bottom line of aged care operators. Even the operators were uneasy about this. The latest quarterly report of the National Disability Insurance Agency has some statistical breakdown on the market concentration of service providers. It shows that in the six months to the end of last year, between 45 per cent and 85 per cent of payments were going through the 10 largest operators system in 70 per cent of the districts in which it operates. It is hard to work out from those numbers exactly how concentrated the service delivery markets are across the country. But we are talking about big bucks here. The largest provider of what is called ""supported independent living"" is an organisation called Life Without Barriers which, in 2022, is receiving $266 million (that doesn't include any other payments going to this group for other services provided). The 10 largest providers combined are providing services worth $1.3 billion in 2022. Similarly, in employment services, where the combined programs are worth about $2 billion a year, the contracts can be incredibly big, and incredibly lucrative. Just days before the federal election, the results of tenders for both the major employment service — which will now be called Workforce Australia — and for another one designed to help young people with special needs into work — the Transition to Work program — were announced. Well, announced is a bit strong. The details of the tenders were released on the departmental website. Bedlam has largely reigned ever since. Although Anthony Albanese has committed to introducing an ICAC within the first six months of a Labor government, Barnaby Joyce does not think many Australians will care, and Scott Morrison says it's now off his agenda. It is estimated that around 80 per cent of existing arrangements were overturned. Providers who had delivered services in particular areas, who had links with local employees and people seeking work on their books, suddenly found themselves being given contracts in areas where they had never worked before, but missing out on their existing business, regardless of their performance. Just at the time when a tight labour market gives a lot of people who have been long-term unemployed the best chance of actually getting a job, somebody decides to blow up the place. One thing that has at least received some attention in the campaign is an anti-corruption commission. But while colour-coded spreadsheets, car park funding and pork barrelling should be under scrutiny and might be more colourful, there are much broader issues to be considered about the accountability, transparency and responsibility involved in the way government works for us.

175,Virus found in pig heart used in human transplant,health,"  Virus found in pig heart transplanted into man who later died Researchers trying to learn what killed the first person to receive a heart transplant from a pig have discovered the organ harboured an animal virus, but they cannot yet say if it played any role in the man's death. The patient, David Bennett, 57, died in March, two months after the groundbreaking experimental transplant. University of Maryland doctors said on Thursday they found an unwelcome surprise — viral DNA inside the pig heart. They did not find signs that the bug, called porcine cytomegalovirus, was causing an active infection. But a major worry about animal-to-human transplants is the risk that it could introduce new kinds of infections to people. Because some viruses are ""latent"", meaning they lurk without causing disease, ""it could be a hitchhiker,"" Bartley Griffith, the surgeon who performed Mr Bennett's transplant, said. Still, development of more sophisticated tests to ""make sure that we don't miss these kinds of viruses"" was underway, Muhammad Mohiuddin, scientific director of the university's xenotransplant program, said. The animal virus was first reported by MIT Technology Review, citing a scientific presentation Dr Griffith gave to the American Society of Transplantation last month. For decades, doctors have tried using animal organs to save human lives without success. Mr Bennett, who was dying and ineligible for a human heart transplant, underwent the last-ditch operation using a heart from a pig genetically modified to lower the risk that his immune system would rapidly reject such a foreign organ. The Maryland team said the donor pig was healthy, had passed testing required by the Food and Drug Administration to check for infections, and was raised in a facility designed to prevent animals from spreading infections. There are loads of ethical questions around the practice of transplanting organs and tissues between species, a technique called xenotransplantation. So what are they, and how is it regulated in Australia? Revivicor, the company that provided the animal, declined to comment. Dr Griffith said his patient, while very ill, had been recovering fairly well from the transplant when one morning he woke up worse, with symptoms similar to an infection. Doctors ran numerous tests to try to understand the cause, and gave Mr Bennett a variety of antibiotics, antiviral medication and an immune-boosting treatment. But the pig heart became swollen, filled with fluid and eventually stopped functioning. ""What was the virus doing, if anything, that might have caused the swelling in his heart?"" Dr Griffith asked. ""Honestly we don't know."" The reaction also did not appear to be a typical organ rejection, he said, noting the investigation still was underway. Meanwhile doctors at other medical centres around the country have been experimenting with animal organs in donated human bodies and are anxious to attempt formal studies in living patients soon. It is not clear how the pig virus will affect those plans.

176,COVID-19 vaccination no longer mandated at Adelaide Zoo but masks required for up-close animal experiences,health,"  From tomorrow Zoos SA will no longer require patrons to be vaccinated, but it will require people taking part in up-close animal experiences to wear masks to prevent the creatures from catching COVID-19. Some ""animal experiences"" — as Zoos SA calls chances to feed animals and get near them — will still not be brought back, such as those with great apes because the risk of transmission is still too high. People will have to wear masks when getting close to lions at the Monarto Safari Park and meerkats, pandas and red pandas at Adelaide Zoo when the ""animal experiences"" return. Children under five years old will be included in the mandate. Adelaide Zoo director Phil Ainsley said there was ""definitely a genuine risk to animals in zoos"", with some animals overseas contracting COVID-19 from visitors and then dying. ""What we do know is that, very similar to the presentation in humans, the impacts of COVID may vary depending on the COVID variant. So, for example, [with] the Delta variant there is definitely some recordings of deaths in animals in zoos in the northern hemisphere,"" he said. ""At the moment there is information which we're still waiting to see emerge, [like] how the Omicron variant is impacting zoo animal collections, but to date there has been no proven case of COVID-19 in a zoo animal collection in Australia that we're aware of."" Zoos SA brought in a COVID-19 vaccine mandate at the Adelaide Zoo and the Monarto Safari Park in December 2021, angering some people who had paid for annual memberships but had not been vaccinated. Dr Ainsley said the zoo would be glad to welcome them back. ""Obviously, all of our members are very valuable to us as an organisation, and we really have been grateful for their support previously and ongoing through the pandemic,"" he said. ""Definitely, we've had conversations and it's a great opportunity for them to come back on site."" Zoo animals have caught COVID-19 overseas and, more rarely, wild animals have caught the virus. Pets have also caught it but there is no evidence they can pass it on to humans. There is no registered COVID-19 vaccination for animals in Australia. Masks will still be required on the Zu-loop bus around Monarto, as they are on all passenger transport in South Australia. South Australia recorded 2,874 new COVID-19 infections today.

177,Legal experts raise concern over SA's proposed COVID laws,health," Coronavirus Legal experts have criticised legislation that the South Australian government says will allow it to ""water down"" the state's COVID-19 restrictions, instead saying it could result in extraordinary one-off powers being enshrined into permanent law. The state government introduced amendments to the Public Health Act earlier this week, which passed through parliament's lower house on Wednesday. But the state's law society has raised concerns over the wording of the bill. Here's a look at what's been happening. Currently, COVID-related orders like isolation requirements, vaccine mandates and state-wide lockdowns are issued under the Emergency Management Act – a piece of legislation that was originally intended for dealing with natural disasters. It gives State Emergency Coordinator and Police Commissioner Grant Stevens extraordinary powers, including the ability to override other laws in the interest of public safety. SA has been operating under that emergency declaration for the past two years – a process that requires the Commissioner's powers to be renewed every 28 days. Under the proposed changes, some of those COVID powers will be moved into health legislation. It will allow SA Health, as opposed to SA Police, to impose isolation requirements on positive cases and close contacts. It will also enshrine rules around vaccination mandates and mask-wearing for staff in high-risk settings such as hospitals and aged and disability care. The government says the move will allow the emergency declaration to end, while still protecting the state's most vulnerable. The Law Society of South Australia has raised several concerns with the wording of the bill, which it says ""does not seem to have any reference"" to safeguards that would protect individual freedoms. ""If the bill is passed as currently proposed, the wide-ranging powers to enforce public directions that are currently available under the Emergency Management Act could be invoked at any time by regulation,"" president Justin Stewart-Rattray said. ""There is no clear explanation in the bill as to who may be deemed a close contact. ""There does not seem to be any reference in the legislation to safeguards to ensure a proportionate response that has regard to an individual's basic rights."" Mr Stewart-Rattray said ""accountability mechanisms"" should be built into the legislation to ensure any advice upon which directions were made was independent and publicly available. ""Given orders can be made that intrude on people's liberties, it is important that the state can demonstrate the evidentiary basis on which they are made,"" he said. When the Victorian government moved to replace its emergency powers with a piece of legislation, opponents raised concerns about powers granted to the Premier and Health Minister, and called for greater oversight and checks to be included. Dozens of amendments were eventually made before the bill became law. University of South Australia legal expert Sarah Moulds said Victoria's legislation was far more advanced than South Australia's when it came to protecting civil liberties and included a pandemic response oversight committee as well as a ""disallowance"" mechanism that effectively allows the parliament to cancel legislation it does not agree with. ""The Victorian legislation … has regard to the human rights that are protected by law in Victoria,"" Dr Moulds said. She pointed out Victoria's Charter of Human Rights formed the basis for the new laws, which allowed for a nuanced response to take into consideration people's needs. ""So people with disability, older people, people with other underlying health conditions or non-English speaking people … might need a different response,"" she said. Meanwhile, the state recorded a drop in COVID cases today, coinciding with a decrease in testing rates. South Australia recorded 2,874 new COVID infections, a decrease of about 1,000 from the day before. But the state also had a 29 per cent drop in PCR testing rates yesterday compared with the previous 24 hours. A woman in her 80s who tested positive to COVID has died. The number of people in hospital increased slightly from 218 on Thursday to 221 today, with 10 people in intensive care. Active cases have dropped to 21,748, the lowest number since March 18.

178,'They were right': Manager of child protection reform told nothing would change and she was wasting her time,health,"  Child protection reform manager tells Tasmania's commission of inquiry that out-of-home care system is broken When Sonya Enkelmann started work as a project manager for out-of-home reform in Tasmania's Communities Department she soon had something of a reality check. ""I was told by a senior policy person that nothing would change and that I was wasting my time,"" Ms Enkelmann said. ""I remember looking at them and going, 'Well if we take that approach we might as well give up now. But they were right.'"" Ms Enkelmann worked in the role for three years from 2017–2020. On Friday she gave evidence to the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings. She said it was the first time she had worked in child safety and what she encountered was a system under strain. ""There's a hesitancy for genuine, open consultation when I was there, there's much more interest in trying to maintain control of the message, which I think is a sign of an organisation that's under stress,"" Ms Enkelmann said. ""It became very apparent to me very quickly that the department had a reputation of being very closed and very defensive, its approach was often considered to be crisis driven and reactive."" The current inquiry into sexual abuse in Tasmania has opened wounds, with one expert saying the ""unexamined dark past"" of the prison island has a lot to answer for — made worse by lingering shame and a compulsion for secrecy. The department is responsible for children who are removed from their homes and placed into foster care. ""It's understandable that there can be fear and reluctance to hold yourself open but, to be honest, I suspect that we actually perform better than we think we do in some ways, that it isn't always doom and gloom,"" Ms Enkelmann said. ""We have a lot of great outcomes for children and young people in out-of-home care because of those children and young people, their own resilience and their own capacities, and the people around them: the carers, individual workers — we have some stirling individuals in the system and we achieve some wonderful outcomes because of that. ""But I would say it's because of those individuals and their relationships that they've developed, rather than as a deliberate result of the system."" Ms Enkelmann told the commission that case workers, whose job includes supporting carers and children in out-of-home care, had ""ridiculous"" workloads, which meant they were not able to support the children or carers adequately in many cases. She said there was a high turnover of case workers and that while the nature of the work was difficult, dealing with out-of-home children was not what was driving them away. ""My sense in terms of talking to people was … that it wasn't the children and young people that were the issue or that the whole process of working in that environment. It's actually the organisation, the system around it that's the frustrating thing,"" she said. A lack of support for carers and children can cause further problems for already vulnerable children, Ms Enkelmann said. ""If it is the case that we're not supporting our carers effectively, and the child ends up having a breakdown in the home, or multiple breakdowns in the home, then we are, as a system, magnifying those vulnerabilities to child sexual abuse, to grooming behaviours. ""Because there are perpetrators out there that can pick a person a mile away who is going to be more amenable to grooming, who has unmet needs, who is isolated, who doesn't have a sense of being loved, who doesn't have a sense of self-worth. ""That's is the worry that I have, that we don't meet children's needs early enough and, when we don't do it well, we can actually magnify those unmet needs and those vulnerabilities in the future. ""There is always going to be homes that unfortunately will break down for some reason, but I think at a system level where we're having this consistently, I would see it as a sign of system failure. ""We're failing those children and we are failing those carers, and for the workers [in the department] it's equally frustrating because they know that they could have done better, that they could have provided support and they could have prevented it happening in the first place."" When asked about what could be done to improve the system, Ms Enkelmann said: ""If we actually implemented so many of the recommendations that have been made before — we have had many, many reviews into out-of-home care and government will say, 'Yes we accept them in full', and then nothing happens, or very little happens."" She said the frustration for people working on the frontline was not about change, but that they do not see change happening where it matters. ""There's all this talk of change and change fatigue, but nothing actually changed on the frontline where it actually really counted in terms of resources for kids, or resources for carers, or capacity for the workers to actually be able to do their job,"" she said.

179,Parents given flu warning as New South Wales reaches its 'trigger' for early start to season,health,"  Parents are being warned to protect their children against influenza as New South Wales reaches its ""trigger"" for an early start to the flu season. Influenza cases have more than doubled in recent weeks and the state's Chief Health Officer, Kerry Chant, said the H1N1 and H3N2 strains were dominant. ""We've got an early indication that the flu season is starting,"" Dr Chant said. ""The proportion [of people who] are testing positive for flu is around 5.5 per cent and that corresponds to our trigger for calling an early start to the flu season. ""We're also seeing increased hospital presentations and hospitalisations, particularly in that 0-4-year-old age group."" There were 1,024 new cases of influenza in New South Wales in the week ending April 30, compared to just 478 cases the previous week. Dr Chant said influenza was circulating widely in the community for the first time in two years and stressed that children under five years of age were particularly at risk. ""Influenza can be a very severe illness in children,"" she said. ""They present with fever, cough, respiratory distress and it can obviously make underlying asthma and other conditions worse."" She said vaccination offered the greatest protection against serious illness and admission to hospital, urging parents to get their children immunised against influenza. ""I know there is a lot of [vaccination] fatigue, we've asked the community to get vaccinated repeatedly,"" Dr Chant said. ""But it is such a critical component of protecting yourself, your loved ones and the broader society."" The influenza vaccine is free for children aged from six months to five years and is available through GP clinics. It is also free for people considered to be at the highest risk from influenza, including pregnant women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with serious health conditions and those aged over 65 years. NSW Health said it was safe and convenient for people to get both the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine at the same time. Health Minister Brad Hazzard admitted there was ""vaccination fatigue"" in the state because of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""It is crucial everyone gets vaccinated against flu to not only protect themselves, but [also] their colleagues and loved ones against serious illness or worse,"" Mr Hazzard said. ""Whilst we know there is vaccination fatigue, I urge the more-vulnerable members of our community to book in for a flu jab with their GP or pharmacist as soon as possible.""

180,"New WA COVID cases dip back below 10,000 but more in hospital, amid warning health system 'barely coping'",health,"  Western Australia has recorded a new peak in the number of people with COVID-19 in hospital, although the total amount of new cases has dipped slightly after yesterday's record high. WA Health has reported 9,328 new cases, down from the 10,182 on Thursday, which had been the most yet since the start of the pandemic. It was also the first time the state had seen more than 10,000 new cases in a single day. But there are now 282 people with the virus in hospital, including nine in intensive care. That is 11 more than was reported yesterday, with the peak doctors' group already warning it was the key figure and reflected the increasing strain on the health system. The Australian Nursing Federation (ANF) said the health system was ""barely coping with the current workload"" and staff were ""overstretched and burnt out"". ANF state secretary Mark Olson said the government needed to bring back some restrictions when the number of COVID-19 hospitalisations reached 300. But Premier Mark McGowan maintains the state has done better than expected and numbers are still below predicted modelling, due to its high vaccination rate and delayed border reopening. Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief economist Aaron Morey said businesses were coping well with the higher number of people with COVID-19. ""As cases rise, we'll see more incidents of staff being unable to come to work. That, of course, will put some pressure on local businesses,"" Mr Morey said. But he said the WA economy and the business community are in a good position going forward. Lifting the mask mandate had led to a burst of activity in the city, he added. The peak business groups wanted extra workers brought in from overseas to help businesses cope with staff shortages from the virus. ""It really does make it apparent how important it is to bring in workers from overseas to Western Australia,"" Mr Morey said. ""WA, more than anywhere else, relies on bringing workers into our state."" Despite the rising case numbers, more West Australians had started going to hospitality venues, Bradley Woods from the AHA WA said, and the problem for venues was now to find enough staff. ""The pressure on the industry at the moment is becoming intense,"" he said. ""We need to focus on finding new workers, more people to work within the hospitality sector — part of that will come from West Australians moving into the industry, part of it will also come from people moving from interstate and overseas."" Mr Woods said the government should do more to attract young people to train and work in WA hospitality and tourism as well as to attract more workers from interstate and overseas. ""We need to partner with organisations like Tourism Australia who are doing major international campaigns encouraging people to come and live and work in Australia and WA needs its fair share of that as well."" He said it was good to see more patrons returning to venues. ""I think West Australians are getting on with living with COVID, just as the rest of the world is. ""People are becoming accustomed to the fact they need to be careful and cautious when they're out and about, even in hospitality environments and that's just part of the way of living with COVID."" The government said WA had now reached an 80 per cent third dose vaccination rate. The rise in cases had been predicted, with the Chief Health Officer warning it would occur because of the easing of restrictions, including WA's mask mandate — a move made at the end of last week. There are currently 48,834 active COVID cases in Western Australia and overall 433,295 cases since the  pandemic began.

182,"The oldest and youngest West Australians are next in line to get COVID, new modelling suggests",health,"  Modelling by the Telethon Kids Institute and Curtin University suggests WA is about halfway through its current COVID-19 Omicron outbreak, with about half a million more West Australians expected to be infected with the virus by the end of June. As of yesterday, the state had recorded 425,704 COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began. Lead researcher Ewan Cameron said his team's modelling showed that figure would double before the outbreak was over. He said that doubling would happen in a much shorter period of time and said the easing of restrictions had no doubt played, and would continue, to play a role. ""We believe that the infection rate over the next two to three weeks will be perhaps the highest it has been throughout the outbreak,"" Dr Cameron said. ""The gradual easing of restrictions has led to an increased rate of transmission. We have both the mask mandate being removed as well as, before that, the change to the close contact definition. ""On the other hand, Western Australians have been very diligent at seeking testing, and so the detection of cases and the sort of isolation of cases during the symptomatic phase has been high, which has helped to slow or reduce the possible impact of removing the mask mandate."" Yesterday Western Australia reported a new record in COVID infections, breaking through the 10,000 daily case mark for the first time. Confirmed cases so far: 660,064 Active cases: 87,103 Cases in hospital: 323 Deaths: 216 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 81.3 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department But according to Dr Cameron and his team's modelling, that figure is not expected to balloon significantly in the weeks ahead. Dr Cameron said the modelling suggested daily case numbers would remain above 10,000 for the next couple of weeks before beginning to drop by the end of May and through June. ""This would not be as rapid a drop-off as has been seen in some other states, but more of a gradual tail."" The Curtin University and Telethon Kids Institute team behind the ""real-time"" modelling created a new software tool to build a ""virtual WA"" based on the state's unique geography and demographics. It used data from a range of sources, including the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Landgate and Google to create the simulations. Researchers involved said that allowed them to capture real interactions and provided the most detailed COVID-19 modelling ever applied to an Australian outbreak. According to the modelling, the majority of people who have already had COVID-19 in this outbreak are in the 18-35 age group, for which 59 per cent of projected infections have already taken place. Mark McGowan says it is ""unlikely"" the mask mandate will be reintroduced but does not rule it out, as vulnerable West Australians express their anxiety with the easing of restrictions. A close second was the 35-65-year-old cohort, for which 56 per cent of infections have already occurred. However, moving forward, the youngest and oldest age groups are expected to account for more infections in the second half of the outbreak. ""The zero to 18-year-old age group is only just past its halfway point at 51 per cent of projected infections, and the 65-plus age group [is at] 53 per cent,"" Dr Cameron said. ""We usually see older people infected later in these outbreaks, and of course, people over 65 are most at risk of becoming seriously ill or dying with COVID-19. ""We've seen this in other states and around the world. These later infections of older people can cause a spike in deaths towards the end of the outbreak, so it's really important that people in that age group take extra precautions to protect themselves."" So far in WA, 157 people have died with COVID, the vast majority of them from this current outbreak. Dr Cameron said the number of deaths was expected to peak around 300 by the end of June with the modelling showing it was unlikely to climb much higher. Yesterday, the number of people in hospital with the virus jumped to 271 from 242 the day before, a figure the WA president of the Australian Medical Association Mark Duncan-Smith said was concerning. Dr Duncan-Smith has repeatedly said any more than 350 people in hospital with COVID at any one time would stretch the health system beyond breaking point, but Dr Cameron said the modelling showed that was unlikely. ""We anticipate that hospitalisations and ICU rates will continue to be at a high level but will [only] slightly increase along with this increase in cases,"" he said. ""ICU and hospitalizations do lag [behind] case numbers so we won't expect to see those upticks this week but into the middle and end of next week. ""Our modelling at this stage suggests that we will remain well below that level of 350 beds occupied.""

183,NSW Now: Free bus rides for inner Sydney commuters,health,"  Sydney News: Sydney commuters given free fares; NSW hits peak in flu cases Here's what you need to know this morning. Some bus travel is fare-free in Sydney's inner west for 24 hours on services run by the company Transit Systems, as drivers turn off Opal card machines as part of an industrial campaign. Drivers are taking action in an area including the Inner West, some of the CBD, Olympic Park, Strathfield, and Rockdale. Transport Workers Union (TWU) state secretary Richard Olsen said the government had refused to negotiate since 2018 when they privatised the region. ""Bus drivers doing exactly the same job are employed on a two-tier system of wages and conditions,"" he said. ""In NSW, competitive tendering's very nature has meant a lowering of standards based on the key requirements of offering the lowest possible price and over-promising on service delivery."" The TWU and the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) appeared before a NSW Parliamentary inquiry on Monday to discuss the impact of the privatisation on bus drivers. People are being urged to get a flu vaccination as soon as possible with the number of cases doubling in recent weeks. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the flu was circulating widely in the community for the first time in two years, coinciding with ongoing high levels of transmission of COVID-19. NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said there had been 1,024 new influenza cases in the week ending April 30, 2022, compared with 478 cases in the previous week. ""There are some early indicators that we might be seeing an early start to the flu season,"" Dr Chant said. ""The percentage of tests testing positive for flu is now at 5.5 per cent and we are seeing increasing numbers of hospital presentations and hospitalisations, particularly in younger children. ""Please get your flu vaccine now, we're particularly urging parents of children aged six months up to five years to take advantage of the free flu vaccine under the national immunisation program."" The elderly, pregnant women, children aged under five years, Aboriginal people and those with serious health conditions can get a free flu shot now from their GP or pharmacy. Dr Chant said it was safe to have a COVID-19 booster and flu jab at the same time. A new $50 million eco-adventure tourism destination has been announced for the Blue Mountains. The 'Gardens of Stone' State Conservation Area near Lithgow will feature Australia's longest zip line, rock climbing, 4WD and mountain bike tracks, and camping areas. The 30,000-hectare property will also showcase and protect several rare and protected animal and plant species. When the project was first proposed last year, Indigenous and conservation groups accused the state government of trying to make money out of efforts to preserve important environmental and cultural sites. Indigenous groups expressed concerns that the development could damage sacred burial sites, artefacts, and caves. ""It's more like a theme park and the Aboriginal Place should be handed back to the community,"" Wiradjuri elder Aunty Helen Riley said. Deputy Premier Paul Toole said the project would create 200 local jobs and attract around 200,000 visitors per year. ""The first-of-its-kind Lost City Adventure Experience will be one of the state's biggest ever regional ecotourism projects that will be a tourism attraction generating millions of dollars for the local economy,"" Mr Toole said. The first stage of the project is expected to open to the public in 2023. The embezzlement trial of Guy Sebastian's former manager is now shrouded in uncertainty after the pop star tested positive for COVID-19. The Australian Idol winner is the star witness in the District Court fraud trial of Titus Day, who managed him for a decade. Sebastian was meant to return to the witness box to give evidence for a second day. But the singer announced he had tested positive on Thursday, forcing the postponement of two performances in Queensland next week. Mr Day is accused of pocketing a million dollars in royalties and performance payments that were meant for the singer. The trial was adjourned yesterday after the judge fell ill. Mr Day has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Away from the outer suburban mortgage belt and the teal-targeted inner-city seats, the Liberal-held electorate of Reid could be the first to fall if there is a swing to Labor in NSW this federal election. Reid, held by the Liberals on a 3.2 per cent margin, is the state's most marginal Liberal seat on a two-party preferred basis. ABC chief election analyst Antony Green said that of all the Liberal seats, it will be the hardest to hold. ""In any statewide swing to Labor, Reid will be one of the first to fall,"" he said. Green described Reid as a ""quite affluent inner suburban seat"", which was held by Labor for 90 years until the 2013 election. Years after he was outed — and then cleared — as a suspect in the disappearance of William Tyrrell, a court has heard the investigation still haunts Bill Spedding. Mr Spedding lost 20 kilograms, avoids being out in public, and says mentally he is not the same man he once was. He was one of the first persons of interest publicly named in the feverish media coverage surrounding how William had vanished on the NSW north coast in September 2014. This week the Supreme Court heard his case for suing the State of NSW for malicious prosecution, and Justice Ian Harrison has now retired to consider his judgement. To be successful in a malicious prosecution case, it must be proven on the balance of probabilities that authorities acted with malice in wrongfully bringing and maintaining a charge. Sunny.

184,Kelsey's midwife caught her baby in the hospital shower. She says it was the best pregnancy she's had,health,"  Aboriginal midwife program works to close the gap in infant mortality and birth complications When Kelsey Muhl's midwife caught her new baby in a hospital shower it was a shared moment between two women who had built a relationship over months. ""Gravity helped,"" Ms Muhl said, laughing about her 4.6kg baby girl Emilia, now six weeks old. The mother of three described her latest birth as poles apart from her earlier experiences. ""With my previous births, it was a lot different,"" she said. ""You just go and have your baby. ""But having a familiar face just helped me have that connection and feeling of support. Ms Muhl and her midwife, Storm Henry, are part of a program pairing First Nations mothers with midwives for the duration of their pregnancy, delivery and the first days of the baby's life. ""We come from a culture where connection is huge, so it just helped me feel very supported through my pregnancy,"" Ms Muhl said. ""I think it's a good model to have and [it is] helping Indigenous women feel supported and connected to someone in the hospital."" About one in 10 Australian mothers have a single midwife, or caseload midwife, throughout their pregnancy, but for mothers of First Nations babies that rate has historically been much lower. ""We know when women have a main midwife or continuity-of-care model there's reduced childbirth complications,"" La Trobe University professor Helen McLachlan said. ""Babies are less likely to get sick, mothers are less likely to need caesarean sections."" More than 18,000 First Nations babies are born across the country each year. Those babies are at a higher risk of arriving early, being born underweight or needing special care. ""Outcomes for [First Nations] mothers and babies are pretty much twice as bad as non-Aboriginal mothers and babies — double the rate of preterm birth, almost triple the rate of maternal mortality,"" Professor McLachlan said. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 13 per cent of Indigenous babies were born underweight in 2019. Reducing that number is a key target of the Closing the Gap agreement. A new culturally safe program led by Latrobe University and the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation is looking to use midwives to achieve that. It was part of a study published this week in The Lancet medical journal. The program has now matched more than 700 women giving birth to Indigenous babies with either a First Nations midwife or one who has been through cultural awareness training. ""We've gone from 5 per cent of Aboriginal women receiving access to this gold-standard model of care to over 90 per cent of Aboriginal women presenting at one of the three hospitals participating,"" Professor McLachlan said. ""Prior to this model, there were only about 30 First Nations women ever who had received this type of care."" ""One of the main things is women feel much more trusting of the system. ""Midwives are providing connection to community, connection with community-based supports."" Ms Henry works at the Baggarrook midwifery care program at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne. Australian Indigenous women are more likely to die during childbirth and their babies are more likely to die during infancy — now researchers globally are demanding changes to close the healthcare gap for First Nations women. She was the midwife who caught baby Emilia. ""As an Aboriginal midwife, it's really nice to work with Aboriginal families,"" Ms Henry said. ""I get some of the challenges that they might face accessing the hospital and I also know how integral the mums and babies are to our healthy communities."" Those involved in the program are calling for it to be expanded. ""We're finding now that we're having to decline women because the spaces are filling up,"" Ms Henry said. ""There's already been 40 families that we were unable to fit into Baggarrook this year so far, so I think it's really important that the hospitals and the government commit to growing these programs."" Professor McLachlan said about 20 per cent of First Nations babies born in Victoria were delivered at the three hospitals involved in the study – The Royal Women's Hospital, The Mercy Hospital for Women and Joan Kirner Women's and Children's Hospital. ""We want the other 80 per cent of women to get access to this culturally safe model of care which we know is associated with better outcomes,"" she said. While there are some similar services scattered around the country, the program's success shows the continuity-of-care model should be made available more extensively, the experts said. ""Back home in Queensland, most of the Indigenous women live in remote communities and have to fly to Cairns, to Townsville or Brisbane to have their babies, so this would definitely benefit,"" Ms Muhl said. ""Sometimes your family can't make it to your birth, so having that familiar face really helped.""

185,Why we'll see a rapid rise in COVID cases in the coming weeks,health,"  By now, many of us will be familiar with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. This variant of concern has changed the course of the pandemic, leading to a dramatic rise in cases around the world. We are also increasingly hearing about new Omicron sub-variants with names such as BA.2, BA.4 and now BA.5. The concern is these sub-variants may lead to people becoming reinfected, leading to another rise in cases. Why are we seeing more of these new sub-variants? Is the virus mutating faster? And what are the implications for the future of COVID? All viruses, SARS-CoV-2 included, mutate constantly. The vast majority of mutations have little to no effect on the ability of the virus to transmit from one person to another or to cause severe disease. When a virus accumulates a substantial number of mutations, it's considered a different lineage (somewhat like a different branch on a family tree). But a viral lineage is not labelled a variant until it has accumulated several unique mutations known to enhance the ability of the virus to transmit and/or cause more severe disease. Israeli health authorities have detected a case of what some are calling ""flurona"" — a double dose of COVID-19 and the flu. It comes as the country is experiencing a spike in influenza cases in recent weeks, sparking fears of a ""twindemic"". This was the case for the BA lineage (sometimes known as B.1.1.529) the World Health Organization labelled Omicron. Omicron has spread rapidly, representing almost all current cases with genomes sequenced globally. Because Omicron has spread swiftly, and has had many opportunities to mutate, it has also acquired specific mutations of its own. These have given rise to several sub-lineages, or sub-variants. The first two were labelled BA.1 and BA.2. The current list now also includes BA.1.1, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5. We did see sub-variants of earlier versions of the virus, such as Delta. However, Omicron has outcompeted these, potentially because of its increased transmissibility. So sub-variants of earlier viral variants are much less common today and there is less emphasis in tracking them. There is evidence these Omicron sub-variants — specifically BA.4 and BA.5 — are particularly effective at reinfecting people with previous infections from BA.1 or other lineages. There is also concern these sub-variants may infect people who have been vaccinated. So we expect to see a rapid rise in COVID cases in the coming weeks and months due to reinfections, which we are already seeing in South Africa. However, recent research suggests a third dose of the COVID vaccine is the most effective way to slow the spread of Omicron (including sub-variants) and prevent COVID-associated hospital admissions. Recently, BA.2.12.1, has also drawn attention because it has been spreading rapidly in the United States and was recently detected in wastewater in Australia. Alarmingly, even if someone has been infected with the Omicron sub-variant BA.1, re-infection is still possible with sub-lineages of BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 due to their capacity to evade immune responses. You'd think SARS-CoV-2 is a super-speedy front-runner when it comes to mutations. But the virus actually mutates relatively slowly. Influenza viruses, for example, mutate at least four times faster. SARS-CoV-2 does, however, have ""mutational sprints"" for short periods of time, our research shows. During one of these sprints, the virus can mutate four-fold faster than normal for a few weeks. After such sprints, the lineage has more mutations, some of which may provide an advantage over other lineages. Examples include mutations that can help the virus become more transmissible, cause more severe disease, or evade our immune response, and thus we have new variants emerging. Why the virus undergoes mutational sprints that lead to the emergence of variants is unclear. But there are two main theories about the origins of Omicron and how it accumulated so many mutations. First, the virus could have evolved in chronic (prolonged) infections in people who are immunosuppressed (have a weakened immune system). Second, the virus could have ""jumped"" to another species, before infecting humans again. Mutation is not the only way variants can emerge. The Omicron XE variant appears to have resulted from a recombination event. This is where a single patient was infected with BA.1 and BA.2 at the same time. This coinfection led to a ""genome swap"" and a hybrid variant. Other instances of recombination in SARS-CoV-2 have been reported between Delta and Omicron, resulting in what's been dubbed Deltacron. So far, recombinants do not appear to have higher transmissibility or cause more severe outcomes. But this could change rapidly with new recombinants. So scientists are closely monitoring them. As long as the virus is circulating, we will continue to see new virus lineages and variants. As Omicron is the most common variant currently, it is likely we will see more Omicron sub-variants, and potentially, even recombinant lineages. Scientists will continue to track new mutations and recombination events (particularly with sub-variants). They will also use genomic technologies to predict how these might occur and any effect they may have on the behaviour of the virus. This knowledge will help us limit the spread and impact of variants and sub-variants. It will also guide the development of vaccines effective against multiple or specific variants.

186,Alicia is 38-years-old — but she lives in a geriatric ward in hospital. And advocates say she's not alone,health,"  NDIS participants like Alicia stuck in hospitals waiting for homes as specialist housing sits vacant, advocacy groups say Alicia Appleby is 38 years old but she's been living in a geriatric ward in a Melbourne hospital for more than 260 days. Ms Appleby has had two strokes, has a mild intellectual disability and needs constant care. She said while the hospital ward she is in was ""lovely"", the staff were struggling with her care, and other patients had been intrusive. ""They can't cope with my complex needs,"" Ms Appleby said. ""There are confused patients. At one stage I had a man try and hop in my bed."" Ms Appleby doesn't need to be in a hospital. The only reason she's there is because of a dispute with the NDIS over the details of her care and housing plan — and she has nowhere else to go. ""One person says one thing and another person says another thing,"" she said. ""It all comes down to they want more information, but they're not listening."" The figures show she is not alone. Advocacy groups estimate 1,140 NDIS participants are stuck in hospitals waiting for plans to be signed off or for disputes to be resolved. The median wait time is up to 200 days, and they say it is costing hospitals $800 million a year. At the same time, the groups estimate there are thousands of specialist homes sitting empty, yet to be allocated to NDIS recipients. There has been a large spike in the number of NDIS participants reporting their plans have been slashed, with many seeking legal help and causing congestion in the appeals system. Under the NDIS, high-needs participants such as Ms Appleby can get specially designed homes under a program called Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA). But they also need people to care for them in those homes. That program is called Supported Independent Living (SIL) and the two work hand-in-hand. Ms Appleby said she was told by the NDIS it was her SIL provider who had rejected her funding. Her SIL provider told her it was ""a lot of other things that were a roadblock"" such as the ""installation of the hoist"". When approached by the ABC, an NDIS spokesperson said Ms Appleby was unable to move into her first property because she was only funded to be one of three people in a house, and it was a property for two people. Ms Appleby was told that if she disagreed with the plan funding she could ""put in for a review"" with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au. She has lodged a review, becoming one of the 4,480 Australians forced to go to tribunals to appeal funding cuts or refusals relating to their NDIS plans during 2021 — more than three times the number of cases in 2020. ""I feel like I'm worthless,"" she said. ""I feel like I'm abandoned by the system."" Advocacy group the Summer Foundation is one of 150 organisations behind a campaign called Down to 10 Days, which is calling on the federal government to make faster, more accurate decisions around housing. Down to 10 Days campaign director Tim Naughtin, who is from the Summer Foundation, said people with disability were either ""stuck in limbo for months or having to fight the NDIS for the accommodation that they need"". Mr Naughtin said it was frustrating that thousands of people were sitting in hospital or nursing home beds waiting for appropriate accommodation, while many houses and units were sitting empty. Many, like Ms Appleby, are told to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to appeal. A Summer Foundation survey found that in 2022, 92 per cent of people end up winning their cases. ""There is an apartment [I know about] that's been empty for close to two years,"" he said. ""It seems the blockage is due to bureaucratic hurdles and delays. Whether that is by design to keep costs down or because the National Disability Insurance Agency simply can't process paperwork efficiently, I don't know."" The Housing Hub, an initiative of the Summer Foundation, is a service that matches people with disability with appropriate housing. A report by the initiative found there were 2,000 room vacancies across 900 of these purpose-built apartments and houses. On top of that, quarterly figures from the NDIS show that the budget for this type of housing has been underspent by more than two-thirds. The NDIS spokesperson said that funding decisions for SDA continued to be made in accordance with the NDIS act. Meet the firms that will carry out eligibility tests under an overhaul of assessments for the NDIS. The spokesperson said they welcomed feedback from NDIS providers and the disability sector to ensure that eligible NDIS participants achieved the right outcomes. NDIS Minister Linda Reynolds said there had been no cuts to the NDIS, the scheme remained fully funded and she had met with the sector to fast-track reforms to SDA housing. ""I agree we must continue to work collaboratively to reduce decision-making time frames,"" she said. ""NDIA need to balance timely decision-making with quality outcomes."" Opposition NDIS spokesman Bill Shorten said the problem was widespread and the Labor Party would increase the number of staff in the National Disability Insurance Agency to work through the backlog. ""We're interested to see the feasibility of putting deadlines on decisions so that there's a guarantee that people only have to wait a certain amount of time to get the decision,"" Mr Shorten said. ""This is a widespread problem and it's causing neglect and desolation of the soul for the people involved."" For Ms Appleby, the wait for her SDA funding issues to be resolved has severely impacted her mental health. ""I have dark days [where] I'm scared to get out of bed because I'm scared I'm going to self-harm. It's a vicious circle."" Ms Appleby said all she wanted was to get out of the ward and into ""secure, stable housing"". ""If I had my own place, I'd be able to live my life, go and see my friends, and go back to study.""

187,"COVID-19's true death toll more than twice that officially reported, WHO report finds",health,"  The World Health Organization (WHO) says nearly 15 million people were killed either by COVID-19 or by its impact on overwhelmed health systems during the past two years, more than double the official death toll of just over 5.4 million. There were 14.9 million excess deaths associated with COVID-19 by the end of 2021, the UN body said on Thursday. The official count of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 and reported to WHO in that period, from January 2020 to the end of December 2021, was slightly more than 5.4 million. Excess mortality figures relied on by the WHO reflect the people who died of COVID-19 as well as those who died as an indirect result of the outbreak, including people who could not access healthcare for other conditions when systems were overwhelmed during huge waves of infection. It also accounts for deaths averted during the pandemic, for example, because of the lower risk of traffic accidents during lockdowns. Those figures are based on country-reported data and statistical modelling, and the WHO did not immediately break down the figures to distinguish between direct deaths from COVID-19 and others caused by the pandemic. The UN agency's chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the figure as ""sobering"", saying it should prompt countries to invest more in their capacities to quell future health emergencies. Albert Ko, an infectious diseases specialist at the Yale School of Public Health who was not linked to the WHO research, said the gathering of such data was important. ""This may seem like just a bean-counting exercise, but having these WHO numbers is so critical to understanding how we should combat future pandemics and continue to respond to this one,"" Mr Ko said. For example, he said, South Korea's decision to invest heavily in public health after it suffered a severe outbreak of MERS allowed it to escape COVID-19 with a per-capita death rate of around a 20th that of the United States. Accurate numbers on COVID-19 deaths have been problematic throughout the pandemic, as the figures were only a fraction of the devastation wrought by the virus, largely because of limited testing and the differences in how countries counted COVID-19 deaths. According to the most-recent government figures reported to WHO — and to a separate count kept by Johns Hopkins University — there have been more than 6 million reported COVID-19 deaths to date. However, scientists at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington calculated there were likely more than 18 million COVID-19 deaths from January 2020 to December 2021. Their findings appeared in a recent study published in the journal Lancet. And a team led by Canadian researchers estimated that there were more than 3 million uncounted COVID-19 deaths in India alone. Some countries, including India, have disputed WHO's methodology for calculating COVID-19 deaths, resisting the idea that there were many more deaths than officially counted. Deltacron has been detected in Australia for the first time this week, with the variant described as a hybrid between Delta and Omicron. Here's what we know so far. Earlier this week, the Indian government released new figures, showing there were 474,806 more deaths in 2020 compared to the previous year, but did not say how many were tied to the pandemic. India did not release any death estimates for 2021, when the highly infectious Delta variant swept through the country, killing many more thousands. Mr Ko said that better figures from WHO might also explain some lingering mysteries about the pandemic, such as why Africa appears to have been one of the least affected by the virus, despite its low vaccination rates. ""Were the mortality rates so low because we couldn't count the deaths or was there some other factor to explain that?"" he said, adding that the crush of deaths in rich countries such as Britain and the US proved that resources alone were insufficient to contain a global outbreak. Dr Bharat Pankhania — a public health specialist at Britain's University of Exeter — said we may never get close to the true toll of COVID-19, particularly in poor countries. ""When you have a massive outbreak where people are dying in the streets because of a lack of oxygen, bodies were abandoned or people had to be cremated quickly because of cultural beliefs, we end up never knowing just how many people died,"" he explained. Although Dr Pankhania said the currently estimated COVID-19 death toll still paled in comparison to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic — when experts estimate up to 100 million people died — he said the fact that so many people died despite the advances of modern medicine, including vaccines, is shameful. With predictions that thousands more people could be diagnosed with long COVID, advocates say more research and support is needed for the 250,000 Australians with chronic fatigue syndrome. He also warned the cost of COVID-19 could be far more damaging in the long term, given the increasing burden of long COVID. ""With the Spanish flu, there was the flu and then there were some [lung] illnesses people suffered, but that was it,"" he said. ""There was not an enduring immunological condition that we're seeing right now with COVID,"" he said. ""We do not know the extent to which people with long COVID will have their lives cut short and if they will have repeated infections that will cause them even more problems.""

Senior assistant Scott Burns will take the coaching role in Nicks's absence. No other players or coaches have been affected so far. Meanwhile, Port Adelaide midfielder Ollie Wines has detailed his experience with being attacked online by people claiming COVID-19 vaccines caused a recent health scare. Wines was subbed out of the round four game against Melbourne after feeling unwell and later spent a night in hospital with a ""spontaneous heart irregularity"" that has since resolved. There is no evidence to suggest heart issues ""have gone through the roof"" as a result of COVID-19 vaccines. He was cleared to return for round six. Panellists on Nine's AFL Sunday Footy Show on April 10 discussed Wines's health and the conversation quickly turned to potential COVID-19 vaccine side-effects. At the time, Wines ruled out any link with COVID-19 vaccines. ""It's nothing to do with that. It's completely unrelated,"" he said. RMIT ABC Fact Check also stated there was no evidence to suggest an increase in heart problems related to COVID-19 vaccination. Wines told 3AW on Wednesday he had been targeted on social media by people who claimed the COVID-19 vaccine was the cause of his heart issue, saying had ""a thousand anti-vaxxers coming at me"". Comments on his Instagram page urged him to ""tell the truth"" about his health condition, not to ""let the AFL silence you"", and ""to stand up and use your platform to save the people"". ""I'll say it on radio: I wasn't being paid off like everyone was saying I was by big pharmaceuticals,"" Wines said. ""It was nothing to do with the vaccine. ""It was far out of my system and everything like that. It was something to do with the heart rhythm that can happen. ""It is rare but can happen in an elite athlete.""

189,'Up-ended the world of an elderly man': Man who attacked good Samaritan jailed,health,"  Darryl Trevor St Clair sentenced to four years in jail over South Plympton hammer attack A man who ""up-ended the world"" of the elderly pensioner he attacked with a hammer before stealing his car in a ""cowardly and ghastly"" attack could be released from prison in less than three years. Darryl Trevor St Clair had just been released from hospital and was on methamphetamine when he knocked on the door of an Ascot Park property in October 2021 holding a rock. St Clair asked Warren Phillips, who had lived in the house for 70 years, to drive him to Marion Road because he was ""afraid of people following"" him. Mr Phillips agreed ""in an act of good Samaritanism"", but St Clair became violent on the drive and threatened Mr Phillips with a hammer. It caused Mr Phillips to crash into a parked taxi at South Plympton in Adelaide's south. St Clair then got out of the car and attacked Mr Phillips with the hammer, causing cuts, abrasions and bruising to his hands, face, head and ribs. St Clair then stole the car keys and drove away. The 39-year-old was arrested after the media published CCTV footage of the incident and his own uncle recognised him and reported him to police. He pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery. District Court Judge Joana Fuller sentenced St Clair to four years and 10 months in jail, saying the crime had ""a debilitating effect"" on Mr Phillips. ""The footage of your behaviour is disturbing to witness and must have been terrifying to experience,"" she said during sentencing. ""Your attack on an elderly man trying to help you was cowardly and it was ghastly. ""After throwing him to the ground you left him there and stole one of his most important possessions which, because of you, he has never recovered and he now cannot replace."" Judge Fuller said Mr Phillip's car, which had never been found, was not insured and was Mr Phillip's ""key to his independence and ability to move around the community"". She said St Clair's mental state was ""disturbed by drug use"" at the time, causing him to snap and assault his victim. ""It is clear that when you're using drugs, you are a danger to the community,"" Judge Fuller said. ""It is a sad indictment on our society that there seems to be no end or limit to the havoc that is wrought by drug use and abuse. ""It's ruined your life and it has up-ended the world of an elderly man."" Judge Fuller said St Clair had committed numerous prior offences, including causing harm by dangerous driving, assault, theft and illegal use and breaches of bail. ""This is by far your most serious offence to date,"" she said. The court heard St Clair was released from prison on a public holiday days before the crime and that he had no money or way to get home. It also heard he had suffered an anxiety attack which triggered the drug use. St Clair will be eligible for parole in just under three years. Outside court, St Clair's lawyer, Tim McGrath, said he thought the sentence was ""fair"". ""Unfortunately, the tragedy that was visited upon Mr Phillips is going to go on a lot longer than that sentence. ""He regrets his actions. He's very sorry. He deeply regrets that.""

190,Victorian Liberal MP says he is 'praying' for abortion to be banned in wake of concern about US law change,health,"  Victorian Liberal MP 'praying' for abortion to be banned in wake of concern about US law change Outspoken Victorian Liberal MP Bernie Finn has posted he is ""praying"" for abortion to be banned, telling a follower he was not supportive of abortion even in the case of sexual assault. The comments have once again triggered fury among his party colleagues, with one MP describing him as ""an abhorrent human being"", while others said he should consider his future. But the response from Opposition Leader Matthew Guy was much more restrained, with Mr Guy describing the posts as the MP's point of view and not reflective of party policy. On Facebook, Mr Finn said, ""so excited the US is on the verge of a major breakthrough to civilisation. Praying it will come here soon. Killing babies is criminal."" The MP was commenting on a leaked draft opinion from the United States Supreme Court that indicated the Roe v Wade decision, which makes abortion a constitutional right, may be overturned. Mr Finn has been a long-standing critic of abortion laws and is a regular feature at the March for the Babies rally. In response to one post that said there should be an option in extreme cases of sexual assault, Mr Finn posted: ""Babies should not be killed for the crime of his or her parent."" Liberal MPs are privately disgusted with Mr Finn and are angry his comments are once again distracting from the party's attempts to win office in November. ""The party is so over someone who is so out of touch, he should seriously consider his future,'' another MP said. ""We've got a message to tell Victorians in the lead up to the election, this is not it."" Multiple Liberal sources said they expected Mr Finn to face a preselection challenge for his upper house spot sometime after the federal election. Others are furious that his comments come during the federal election, especially when the party is facing a revolt from small ""l"" liberal voters in Kooyong and Goldstein. Mr Guy said the social media comments were a reflection of Mr Finn's personal views rather than a party agenda. ""That's Bernie's point of view. I am focused on Victoria, not on social policy in the United States,"" Mr Guy said. ""What Bernie posts is up to Bernie."" When pressed on the Liberal Party's stance towards abortion, Mr Guy said the historical precedent of conscience voting remained unchanged. ""We've had free votes for many, many years on this matter, they'll always continue,"" he said. It is not the first time Mr Finn's social media comments have raised anger and embarrassment for the state opposition. The party has previously spoken to Mr Finn about false conspiracy theories posted. Mr Finn has also published memes of Premier Daniel Andrews dressed as Hitler with the ABC logo replacing the swastika on his arm. Mr Finn has been contacted for comment.

191,"Work begins on $100m Maroochy Private Hospital, to specialise in advanced orthopaedic surgery",health,"  Sunshine Coast poised to become hip replacement capital as population ages Doctor Daeyvd Rodda moved to the Sunshine Coast seven years ago with a dream of building a health facility run by surgeons and aimed at helping patients get back on their feet. On Wednesday, the orthopaedic surgeon's dream came a step closer to reality, as construction began on the new Maroochy Private Hospital. The eight-storey building will stand out, not just because of its striking design that features multi-level windows and cascading gardens. Dr Rodda said the facility would become a training and research hub, that had already attracted orthopaedic surgeons from across Australia and abroad. ""Originally, I had this vision to come up with a multidisciplinary surgical hospital that would be a real centre for excellence,"" Dr Rodda said. ""A place where surgeons were in charge of the care they provided to their patients … a place where patient outcomes came before corporate interest … a place where it wasn't just about clinical care, it was about research and innovation."" Dr Rodda has teamed up with healthcare property fund managers Barwon Investment Partners, technology specialists Medacta, and the University of the Sunshine Coast. USC vice-chancellor Helen Bartlett said the 48-bed facility would offer a post-graduate certificate in anterior hip surgery, believed to be a world-first. ""It is definitely unique,"" Ms Bartlett said. ""The building is going to house different types of companies and providers in all the sort of health and sports sphere, and that means we will be able to collaborate in many different ways. ""We're going to be locating some of our other health courses here, including orthotics and prosthetics, occupational therapy and, in the future, physiotherapy. ""So it will become a real ecosystem for training, education and also research."" Barwon Investment Partners has committed $100 million to the project. Company director Tom Patrick said the hospital, due to be completed by the end of next year, would be ideally located in the CBD. ""What was really important for us was ensuring that we had great amenity for doctors and patients during their stay and their working days in the hospital,"" Mr Patrick said. ""We canvassed the entire Sunshine Coast and we really believe in this new CBD location as a place for the coming 20, 30 years."" The Sunshine Coast has one of the highest populations of residents aged 65 years and older in Queensland. It's also known as a sporting capital. That combination of an ageing and athletic community has led to a surge in demand for orthopaedic procedures, according to Dr Rodda. ""You really couldn't pick a more perfect demographic to have a facility like this,"" the surgeon said. ""The growing need for joint replacement surgery, particularly hip and knee replacement surgery, has been very evident. ""And I've seen that, in my own practice, the numbers of patients requiring these surgeries have really skyrocketed, and even though COVID, with the demographic changes and people moving up from Melbourne and Sydney, it's only added to that demand."" Sunshine Coast Mayor Mark Jamieson said the project was a demonstration of the ""faith and confidence"" the investment market had in the region. ""And in particular, this very unique opportunity to build a city centre — we are building a city of the future,"" Mr Jamieson said. ""This is a really important moment."" While regional areas often experience trouble attracting and retaining medical specialists, Dr Rodda said the reverse was true in this case with surgeons lining up to get involved. ""It's actually a good problem to have,"" Dr Rodda said. ""And we appreciate the support that the medical community has shown to this project. ""And we expect that demand will only grow as the project is coming to fruition."" ABC Sunshine Coast will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

192,"SA records 3,894 COVID-19 cases, four deaths of people with the disease",health,"  South Australia has recorded 3,894 new COVID-19 cases and four deaths of people with the disease. SA Health said two women and two men, all in their 80s, who tested positive for COVID have died. That brings the total number of deaths since the start of the pandemic to 370. Today's case numbers were an increase of 303 compared to yesterday, but coincided with a 9.8 per cent rise in testing rates. There are now 218 people with COVID in hospital, down slightly from yesterday, and 11 in intensive care. South Australia now has 22,539 active cases, the lowest since March 18.

193,"Uncharted territory for WA as COVID cases top 10,000, with six more deaths recorded",health,"  Western Australia has recorded 10,182 new cases of COVID-19, the highest number of daily cases since the pandemic began. It follows a previous peak of 9,782 cases in the state yesterday. But Premier Mark McGowan maintains the state has done better than expected, due to its high vaccination rate and delayed border reopening. There are now 271 people in hospital with the virus, an increase of more than 10 per cent on yesterday's figures, and nine are in ICU. The state has also reported six more deaths of people with COVID dating back to March 28, four women and two men over the age of 80. The rise in cases had been predicted, with the Chief Health Officer warning it would occur as a consequence of easing restrictions, including the removal of mask-wearing, which happened at the end of last week. Mr McGowan said the government had expected to see an increase in case numbers, but said that figure wasn't the most appropriate to use when assessing where the state is at in its COVID-19 journey. ""We expected case numbers would perhaps increase a little bit and they're relatively flat, they're much less than was predicted in the modelling some months ago,"" he said. ""The ICU and hospitalisations rates are significantly less than what was predicted."" ""The most important thing to look at in all of this is the hospitalisations, particularly intensive care as that gives us the best indication of the severity of the illness."" Despite the rise in COVID cases, the Premier reiterated the state had achieved a 'soft landing', after delaying re-opening the border due to the Omicron outbreak over east. ""The softest landing in the world, with the best health outcomes and the best economic outcomes of anywhere in the world with the highest vaccination rates of anywhere in Australia, probably the world,"" he said. Confirmed cases so far: 660,064 Active cases: 87,103 Cases in hospital: 323 Deaths: 216 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 81.3 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department ""And a community that is well-prepared and prepared to adhere to the rules that are in place currently."" In February, the state government released Omicron-based modelling that predicted WA would reach a peak of 10,363 cases by late March. The previous peak before cases started to rise this week was recorded on March 29, when WA tallied 9,754 cases. That modelling also predicted there would be around 443 COVID patients in WA hospitals at one time, with 56 of those likely to require intensive care. While there has been a significant jump in hospitalisations in the past 24 hours, from 242 to 271, that figure remains far below those predictions from the state government modelling. Mr McGowan predicted case numbers would continue to ""bounce around"" following the removal of restrictions last week. ""We think it will remain relatively stable, but it will bounce around, the numbers will bounce around,"" he said. ""Anyone out there who is concerned, if you want to wear a mask, weak a mask."" He pointed to WA's free RAT program, which offers each household 15 free tests, as a possible reason for the rising case numbers. More than half of today's infection figures came from positive rapid antigen tests according to WA Health, with 6,069 cases self-reported and 4,113 confirmed through PCR testing ""You've got to remember the case numbers are based on self-reporting,"" he said. WA takes a giant step towards living with COVID-19, as a whole raft of restrictions are removed. ""They're dependent on people basically logging on and saying they have COVID so as to whether or not people are out there who aren't doing that we don't know, because we can't tell. ""We have provided more RATs to the community than anywhere in Australia so naturally that is going to mean more RAT testing and therefore more people reporting than anywhere else in Australia,"" Mr McGowan said. Mr McGowan said WA had reached a third-dose vaccination rate for those aged 16 and over of 79.9 per cent. WA has reported 425,704 cases since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Australian Medical Association WA president Mark Duncan-Smith said the new record in infections should be a reminder that the pandemic is not over. ""It's greatly concerning to doctors that there's been approximately 7,000 deaths in Australia since the beginning of the pandemic, even more concerning is that 2,000 of those have occurred in the last 30 days,"" he said. ""This is a clear message to both Western Australia and all Australians that this pandemic is not over. ""We are still in the middle of this pandemic. And for WA, we've hit the new peak."" He did not agree with the Premier that the ICU rate was the most important figure  when assessing the state's COVID position. ""The hospitalisation rate is also a key figure of where you're going to be a week later, as far as ICU rates go,"" he said. ""Hospitalisations are up 12 per cent compared to yesterday.  We need to keep a close eye on this figure because the medical system is under strain. ""There is a lot of people furloughing, there's a lot of people off sick with COVID."" Dr Duncan-Smith said he thought it was too early to determine what impact the most recent removal of restrictions, including the mask mandate, would have. He said he believed the latest peak in infections was likely a result from the removal of prior restrictions, which were lifted mid-April. ""It'll be very interesting to see where we go next week, which will probably reflect more of what's happened due to the mask mandate,"" he said. ""I also reiterate what I've said previously, that I would have much preferred the government use the language that masks are now voluntary indoors, rather than them saying that they're no longer mandated."" And with the influenza season now underway, Dr Duncan-Smith urged people to get vaccinated. ""That is another effect that the government really has to watch closely,"" he said. ""This [the flu] in combination with COVID could see a very ugly winter and certainly anybody who has a flu vaccine due, I strongly encourage them to get their flu shot. ""And if anyone is due a COVID vaccine, go and get that as well.""

195,'It's that time of the month': Top golfer Lydia Ko praised for talking about her period,health," Sport Lydia Ko praised for normalising periods in sport after revealing back treatment was because she was menstruating One of the top ranking golfers in the world is being praised for openly discussing how her period impacts her performance. Lydia Ko revealed in a live TV interview during the Palos Verdes Championship that she was battling a bad back because she was menstruating. Her honest comment left Golf Channel commentator Jerry Foltz — who asked if she was concerned following her on-course physical therapy — speechless. ""It's that time of the month — I know the ladies watching are probably like 'yeah I got you',"" Ko said. ""When that happens, my back gets really tight and I'm all twisted and it's not the first time [the physical therapist] Chris has seen me twisted, but it felt a lot better after he came. ""So yeah, there you go."" When Foltz didn't respond, Ko said: ""I know you're lost for words Jerry."" The New Zealand golfer, who tied for third place in the tournament, later posted the video to her Instagram account with the caption: ""FACTS. Fun way to cap off the West coast swing! Can’t wait to be back."" Foltz said the interview, which has gone viral, was a ""priceless moment"". ""She was real and I was caught off guard,"" he said. Ko has been praised for normalising menstruation, which is rarely addressed in sport. ""Absolutely love this. I'm on that same schedule and felt like an absolute noodle last week. Glad Lydia finally had an honest take on it. Impressive how well she played considering,"" German golfer Sophia Popov tweeted. Periods present differently in every woman, and for many athletes it becomes an obstacle that affects their performance on the field. Menstruation is part of the monthly cycle where the uterus, or womb, sheds its lining when a biological female is not pregnant. In addition to bleeding through the vagina, menstruation can also cause cramps in the lower abdomen or back, bloating, tender breasts, headaches, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, fatigue, mood swings and difficulty sleeping. Menstruation can last between three to eight days and the blood is collected by sanitary products such as pads, tampons or menstrual cups. A decade-by-decade snapshot of 100 years of menstrual product advertisements shows that communication about periods might be finally getting real. Female athletes have rarely discussed in public how their periods have impacted them. Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui became the first Olympic athlete to discuss periods when she told a reporter at the 2016 Rio Games that she had not performed well due to the timing of her period. ""It's because my period came yesterday, so I felt particularly tired. But this isn't an excuse, I still didn't swim well enough,"" the 20-year-old told a TV reporter at the time. Former Ireland rugby international Sophie Spence told the BBC in 2020 that more attention needed to be paid to menstruation cycles in women's sport. ""Only females understand that as much. It is a huge thing and it comes down to more females being involved at a certain level for performances to peak even more within athletes,"" Spence said. ""If you are a female in a female sport but are surrounded by men being your coaches then their understanding is a lot different because they do not experience what you are experiencing.

196,"Victoria passes grim COVID-19 milestone with more than 3,000 deaths since start of pandemic",health," Coronavirus As of today, more than 3,000 people have lost their lives to COVID-19 in Victoria since the beginning of the pandemic. Despite three years of new cases, half of those deaths have happened this year alone. Leading epidemiologists have long warned that easing restrictions across the state could come with a rise in cases and, inevitably, deaths. To December 31 last year, a total of 1,525 Victorians had died from COVID-19. That figure is now 3,012 as 14 more people were today reported to have died with the virus. Victorian COVID-19 deaths account for the largest share of the more than 7,000 deaths across all states and territories. Most people who contract the virus make a full recovery in Australia. In fact, Australia's death rate for COVID-19 is one of the lowest in the world, just 0.12 per cent of people fatally contract the virus. The United States has a death rate of 0.79, while 18 per cent of people who test positive in Yemen die from the virus. Experts say the state's high vaccine coverage — 95 per cent of Victorians double dosed and 68 per cent triple vaccinated — is responsible for keeping the figure lower than elsewhere. Yet, on average, 15 people are dying from COVID-19 each day in Victoria, and 40 people are dying per day nationwide. Christopher Hall from the Australian Centre for Grief and Bereavement said it was important to remember those who have lost their lives are people. ""That represents families and workplaces and communities that have been permanently impacted by the death of somebody within that network,"" Mr Hall said. ""I think it's easy, perhaps, for people to think that COVID is now a historical event and and that we're moving forward into this post-C0OVID period. ""But, in fact, there are many people who will continue to live very much in that COVID period."" Donna Bricknell's father, Patrick Bricknell, was one of the 3,000 Victorians who died with COVID-19. In July 2020, after a COVID-19 case emerged in their father's nursing home, Ms Bricknell and her sister tried to convince their father to stay with them. But, as usual, Mr Bricknell wanted to make sure his daughters didn't worry. ""He said 'I'm fine — they're testing me for COVID the next day and, if I'm negative, then we'll have a chat then about whether I can come and stay with one of you',"" Ms Bricknell said. ""The very next day, he called me to let me know he was positive and my heart sank."" In the following weeks, Donna and her family underwent the painful task of chasing under-pressure nurses and hospital staff for updates on their father's situation. Every day, Victorians are dying from COVID. They are mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers. We don't want them to be reduced to numbers. We want to hear their story. Hospital restrictions and high COVID-19 cases meant Donna and her family were unable to be with her father the moment he died. ""That's the hardest part, you know, [he was] on his own,"" Ms Bricknell said. The majority of people who have died with the virus have been older Australians and, Ms Bricknell said, hearing people dismiss her father's death based on his age has been hard. ""That's just having no compassion for us as a family,"" she said. ""What we went through with him, they don't realise that when you die from COVID, you die alone."" She said her heart breaks every day that she sees another person has died from the virus. ""The pain that we went through, to know that there's 3,000 other families out there that feel the same pain as us, that's really heartbreaking."" Mr Hall said that, for every person who dies, it's estimated 10 people have been ""profoundly impacted by it"". ""So we're looking at 30,000 Victorians who have direct personal knowledge, and experience, of somebody who has died [from the virus],"" he said. Mr Hall said COVID-19 deaths, in particular, can lead to lasting trauma for those around them. ""These are often deaths that have happened very quickly, as people have deteriorated quite rapidly,"" he said. ""There have been complications in terms of family and friends, being able to be present at the time of death and to speak to the dying person."" Mr Hall said it was important that those grieving the loss of a loved one reach out for help from family or friends. ""But, when that's not enough, that they reach out and seek support from services such as [ones familiar with] experiencing grief and bereavement,"" he said.

197,Family of child left on childcare bus for hours says 'she's her happy self' but remains in intensive care,health,"  Family of toddler Nevaeh Austin found unconscious on Queensland childcare centre bus demand answers The grandmother of a three-year-old girl left on a Central Queensland bus for up to six hours on Wednesday says the family are ""mortified"" by the incident.

""You expect that child to come home happy, healthy — maybe dirty or a little bit hungry — but you expect them to come home,"" Ms Parker said. ""You do not expect a phone call saying 'I'm sorry'. That doesn't cut it. It's not good enough. ""This is a little girl. She's someone's daughter. She's someone's granddaughter. She's someone's sister. She's someone's best friend. ""That doesn't happen. It shouldn't happen and should never happen again."" It comes after police revealed Nevaeh was the only child driven on the Central Queensland childcare centre bus before she was left inside for about six hours Wednesday afternoon. Ms Parker said she would fight to ensure this never happens again. ""I'll make sure this never happens again. I'll die fighting for it. I will give up my life for my grandchildren. I'll give up my life for my children,"" she said. Ms Parker said her granddaughter's prognosis was looking positive. ""She's doing all right and she's tired, but she's here, she's breathing on her own, she's her happy self."" She described Nevaeh as an outgoing and energetic three-year-old. ""She's cheeky. She loves people. She loves to make noise. She likes makeup — typical three-year-old. ""She'll stop and talk to the workmen about how their day is, tell them what truck they're driving and tell them 'have a good day,"" she said. Detective Inspector Darrin Shadlow said two staff from Le Smileys Early Learning Centre got off the bus without Nevaeh about 9:00am on Wednesday. He said she was found unconscious six hours later when staff went to use the bus for the after-school pick up at about 3:00pm. ""It would appear that Nevaeh was the only child on the bus at the time,"" he said. ""Obviously, when they returned to the centre, the driver and one other person who were in the bus at the time, have forgotten that she was there. ""It would appear there were some breaches of procedures … and a young child is fighting for their life."" Nevaeh was taken into the centre, where paramedics performed CPR to revive her. She was transported to the Rockhampton Hospital, and was then flown to Brisbane overnight. Detective Inspector Shadlow did not want to speculate as to whether Nevaeh would make a full recovery. ""She was in quite a serious condition last night, I believe that has stabilised a bit,"" he said. ""She is still critical, but thankfully stable."" Detective Inspector Shadlow said Nevaeh had been picked up from a Gracemere home in the morning and was sitting in the second row of the bus with her bag when she was left behind. It was parked in front of the centre, next to the front entrance. ""We will leave no stone unturned in relation to the investigations,"" he said. ""We will also have photographic and our scientific, forensic officers attending the scene [on Thursday], just so we can cover every base and get to the bottom of exactly what has happened."" The team will also look at who was coming and going from the centre throughout the day. ""We will potentially look further afield than just the driver and the support worker,"" he said. Detective Inspector Shadlow believed the bus was owned by the centre and both adults that were on there worked for the centre. The centre was cordoned off by police this morning and it was not clear when it would reopen. ""We've declared a crime scene on the bus at the childcare centre at this stage,"" Detective Inspector Shadlow said. ""The childcare centre will not be operating until we've released that crime scene, which could be a couple of days."" Detective Inspector Shadlow said the staff involved were ""cooperating to a degree"", but legal advice had been sought. ""We all pray for a full recovery of Nevaeh,"" he said. ""[The family] are obviously distraught … and are with Nevaeh in Brisbane."" Queensland Ambulance Service operations supervisor Jason Thompson said on Wednesday that paramedics treated her on the floor of the childcare centre. ""I get goosebumps just as I speak about it now,"" Mr Thompson said. ""When a child is sick, it's traumatic, and when one is as critical and unconscious, your heart goes out to them."" The incident comes two years after three-year-old Malik Nicholas Floyd Namok-Malamoo died after he was found on a Goodstart Early Learning centre bus at Edmonton, south of Cairns. Queensland Treasurer Cameron Dick said it was important to let police complete their investigation. ""Whether you're running a daycare centre, whether you're running a childcare centre or a kindergarten, whether you're a mum or dad, anyone who's got the care of children has a very simple rule to follow when their children are in a vehicle: 'Look before you lock',"" he said. ""That is a very simple rule and I think for many of us we're finding it hard to understand how this incident could have occurred again."" Queensland Education Minister Grace Grace said the campaign to reduce incidence of children being left on buses had been successful. ""As a result of this campaign, we have seen the numbers of children being left on buses significantly reducing,"" she said. ""However one child is still too many."" Ms Grace said her department, which acts as the regulatory authority, was working closely with the police on the matter. ""The regulatory authority does not hesitate to take serious action when services fail to ensure children's health and safety, and where other tragic incidents have occurred, the necessary action has been taken,"" she said. Australian Childcare Alliance Queensland president Majella Fitzsimmons said the Queensland government updated legislation after Malik's death. She said childcare centres must have policies and procedures for transporting children on the bus and staff need to complete a risk assessment and be retrained each quarter. She said most childcare buses were used to help vulnerable and disadvantaged families who do not live on a bus route or do not have cars to get their children to daycare. ""It is so important for these children to attend early learning services in that zero-to-five years for that brain development and early intervention,"" Ms Fitzsimmons said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Federal Assistant Minister for Children and Families, Michelle Landry, who is also the local member, called for a major review of childcare centres. ""Childcare centres need to follow what they are supposed to do,"" she told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""You don't expect your child to be left in a vehicle and then now today she's in a Brisbane hospital. ""This is inconceivable that this has happened again and how it happened.""

198,States pressure federal parties for election commitment to splitting the bill on hospital funding,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The states and territories are mobilising for a stoush with both sides of federal politics over public hospital funding, as doctors warn patients will suffer unless more money is committed. While health funding is an age-old battle, staging it during a federal election campaign takes the fight to a new level. State health ministers are united in calling for additional support, with all eight jurisdictions sending a joint letter to federal Health Minister Greg Hunt last October, asking for ""immediate additional Commonwealth funding"". This week, South Australian Health Minister Chris Picton told the ABC that public hospitals were under immense pressure. ""In South Australia, here we have an absolute crisis in our healthcare system,"" Mr Picton said. ""If the Commonwealth was picking up their share of the funding, then we could do even more, help more patients, make sure that we can reduce ambulance ramping even more, and make sure that people can get the care that they need."" Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Typically, the federal government picks up 45 per cent of public hospital costs, with the states and territories covering the rest But the money is conditional — the Commonwealth puts the brakes on any large cost increases by limiting annual growth to 6.5 per cent, which means the states and territories have to cover any additional expenses. At the height of the pandemic, the Coalition agreed to pay a greater share of overall funds through a 50:50 funding deal that runs until 2023 But the states and territories are angling for that to be longer term, on a national public hospital funding bill that topped more than $66 billion in 2019-20. The federal government has long argued it has already upped its funding significantly throughout the pandemic, and appearing on Nine Radio this week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed if the federal contribution increased, the states would try to hoard the extra money. ""What we're talking about is just the Commonwealth paying more and the state government paying less,"" he said. ""I mean, the same amount would be spent, it would just be the Commonwealth paying more."" But the states have dismissed those suggestions, arguing they would reinvest the additional money rather than pocket it. ""What we're talking about is extra resources,"" Mr Picton said. ""So I mean, this is really short sighted, unfortunately, from the Prime Minister yet again, we're not seeing him investing sufficiently in aged care in primary care, and in hospitals as well."" How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' Australian Medical Association Vice President Chris Moy said Australians would be the ones paying the price if a deal was not struck soon. ""It's basically allowing people to continue to suffer, not getting the care that they should receive,"" he said. ""And to some degree, bears responsibility for people who are dying, or who suffer because of the lack of care."" COVID-19 has left a trail of budgetary bruises that both sides of politics are keen to heal. Labor leader Anthony Albanese this week agreed to a discussion on the health funding issue, but stopped short of promising extra money. ""What we will do is sit down with premiers constructively and work these issues through,"" he said. Anne Ruston, who will be the health minister if the Coalition is re-elected, told the ABC on Wednesday she was also open to discussions. ""I will be seeking to work with all stakeholders in the health and the aged care portfolios to work on ways that we can make sure our world class health system and aged system are continuously improved,"" she said. But Dr Moy urged both parties to commit to increasing federal hospital funding, saying it was ""mind boggling"" it had not already happened. ""The hospital system is clearly inadequate for the needs of the Australian population,"" he said. ""We have hospitals that are essentially what we call in logjam, they are just full, in terms of providing care for people having surgery, for heart disease, all those sorts of thing. ""The states are very clear in the fact they can't do this anymore, and what they need is the federal government to contribute their share, frankly.""

199,Western Australia could be facing a much higher peak of COVID-19 cases and a slow plateau. Here's why,health,"  After Western Australia removed almost all of its COVID-19 rules last week, yesterday's new peak of 9,782 daily cases was pretty much expected. And with case numbers tending to be higher on Thursdays, it's possible today's tally will be another record. The Chief Health Officer warned this would likely happen, and it was a consequence of easing restrictions accepted by both Premier Mark McGowan and the Health Minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson. Asked about the rise yesterday, Ms Sanderson reiterated the key statistics are hospitalisations and intensive care admissions, which have remained relatively consistent. But the next two weeks will be telling, given that's how long it can take between someone contracting the virus and becoming ill enough to need hospital treatment. If hospitalisations skyrocket, it could jeopardise Mark McGowan's promise of a soft landing. Daily infections can be a useful metric, but it doesn't tell the whole story. One of the useful things case numbers can show is where hospital admissions could be in a week or two, because of the lag between testing positive and ending up in hospital. Even if hospital admissions aren't rising though, looking at new cases can be important, for a number of reasons. As one example, more cases in the community means more healthcare workers testing positive, reducing capacity in the health system and adding strain. Nancy Baxter is a clinical epidemiologist and head of the University of Melbourne's school of population and global health. She also warned every infection came with the risk that person would be left with long COVID. ""It's hard to know the exact number,"" she said, ""probably less than 10 per cent but likely more than five per cent."" ""So that's a real number of people that are affected over a long period of time with COVID... a lot of people who are unable to work, short-term or even longer-term."" Unfortunately, more infections will almost certainly mean more deaths too. ""And some of that will be because restrictions were relaxed,"" Professor Baxter said. We don't really know, in part because the path ahead depends on how people respond to rising case numbers. Professor Baxter said Western Australia could be facing a much higher peak and a slow plateau from here. WA takes a giant step towards living with COVID-19, as a whole raft of restrictions are removed. ""People may respond to the numbers today by just shrugging their shoulders and not doing anything about it,"" Professor Baxter said. ""[But] if everybody did some little things that reduce the risk ... that would help reduce transmission and help you get back over this sooner and back to a lower number of cases."" Part of the issue, she said, is the previous peak came when wide-ranging restrictions were in place. ""That means there are less people who've actually contracted COVID in communities in WA,"" Professor Baxter explained. ""Which means that you don't have that same protection from having a number of people recently having had the infection as you did in those other states where you saw the numbers come down quite quickly. ""I think there may well be another significant peak and it may be some time before we're really on the other side of the peak in WA."" The Australian Medical Association continues to remind people the vast majority of West Australians have not yet contracted COVID. It's a bit of a mixed bag, and seems to depend on just how sharp the initial peak was. In places like New South Wales and Victoria, cases did start increasing again as restrictions were removed, but they didn't come anywhere near the extreme peaks seen early in the year. It was a similar story in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and in Queensland. However, in South Australia and Tasmania, cases in the second wave did end up going higher than the initial peak, with increases of between seven and 11 per cent. Western Australia's cases yesterday were only marginally higher than the previous peak, so it remains to be seen how much higher they'll go. When asked about this yesterday, Ms Sanderson said she had spoken to the Chief Health Officer, who was ""comfortable"" with the current rules. Mark McGowan says it is ""unlikely"" the mask mandate will be reintroduced but does not rule it out, as vulnerable West Australians express their anxiety with the easing of restrictions. But both Professor Baxter and the Australian Medical Association in WA would have preferred them to stay longer. ""I would relax many of the other things that have been relaxed before I would relax masks,"" Professor Baxter said. ""They don't stop you from doing anything, they allow you to do all your activities, they just protect you from others and others from you."" AMA WA president Mark Duncan-Smith is keen to see them come back, especially if the number of people in hospital climbs. ""This is a small price to pay to protect the medical system that people are otherwise going to need when they get COVID,"" he said. Premier Mark McGowan said last week it was “unlikely” masks would be reintroduced, but would not rule it out. Vaccination and mask wearing remain the best ways to stay safe from the virus. But with fewer people keeping masks on, Professor Baxter said those still wearing them needed to change their habits. ""It's really important that people start to look for high-quality, well-fitted masks, so those are P2 or N95 respirators,"" she said. ""It's really important because if not everybody is wearing a mask, you need to have the best protection possible to prevent you from getting COVID."" And with greater access to antiviral treatments for people who do get seriously ill with the virus, Professor Baxter said early testing and diagnosis was critical.

200,What you need to know about getting vaccinated against the flu with COVID-19 around,health,"  Flu season has officially arrived, with Australia already seeing thousands of cases of the virus. Both COVID-19 and influenza are now circulating in the community, and health authorities are pleading with people to get their flu shot to reduce the ""life-threatening"" risk of having both at the same time. Here is what you need to know about reducing your risk of catching influenza or the flu/COVID combo — dubbed ""flurona"" — this winter. Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, says you can get the vaccine if you've recovered from the virus, but it's best to wait if you've still got severe symptoms so as to not ""fire up an already fired-up immune system"". ""So the usual thing with vaccination is if you've got any signs or symptoms or you're ill — you've got a fever or anything like that — don't get the vaccine at that particular time,"" he said. If you're feeling fine, however, you're good to go straight away. ""Once you're better, and once you're out of isolation, you can go and have your flu vaccine safely,"" Maria Boulton from AMA Queensland says. Yes, under ATAGI guidelines, people are now able to get a COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine at the same time, even though the previous advice was to wait. ""[The prior advice] was just making sure that it was safe,"" Dr Mackay said. ""And that really requires seeing what happens with different groups around the world who are doing two vaccinations at once, and one followed by another, or in the opposite order. ""It's really just making sure there is enough data for the Australian authorities to give the best advice. ""I really strongly recommend you do get your flu shot and your booster at the same time. And you'll be as safe as you can possibly be."" Dr Boulton says her clinic has experienced an uptick in the number of people receiving both vaccines together. ""There's no need to delay and we're getting a lot of patients who are taking us up on both at the same time, and it's really great because then they don't have to come back again,"" she said. Dr Mackay says the most common reason people are hesitant about getting the flu shot is because they believe it doesn't protect them well from the flu. ""We tend to think of the flu vaccine as being a bit rubbish, and that's not really true,"" he said. ""If it's a good match it's a really good vaccine. He says its effectiveness really depends on how the virus has changed or evolved by the time the flu season arrives. ""That means the vaccines have to change. It's not about a rubbish vaccine. It's about how much that virus has outsmarted us. And because we have to predict ahead of time to make our flu vaccines, we are hoping that what arrives in winter is what we planned for. ""We're not always brilliantly protected from the flu. That's not the fault of the vaccine. It's the fault of the fact that this is a slippery virus."" Dr Boulton says there has definitely been fewer people getting vaccinated against the flu so far this year, compared to last. ""I think people are slightly fatigued about vaccines, but it is important to know that that the flu can be a serious condition, especially for young young babies, older people, people with chronic illnesses and pregnant women,"" she said. ""Our borders are open. There's not as many restrictions as there were before. And so we expect that the flu virus will circulate once again. And we know that for some people they can have quite a severe disease so the best thing we can do is vaccinate."" It's been a long time since we've had a ""flu season"" and Dr Mackay says it's important to remember there are four main types of flu and they all circulate at the same time — another reason why making a foolproof vaccine is difficult. Israeli health authorities have detected a case of what some are calling ""flurona"" — a double dose of COVID-19 and the flu. It comes as the country is experiencing a spike in influenza cases in recent weeks, sparking fears of a ""twindemic"". ""It's going to be a bit different this year, I think, than it has been for the last two years, but generally there's two different flu B's and two different flu As and they all co-circulate,"" he said. ""They're all flu viruses and they're all more different from each other than any of the variants of SARS‐CoV‐2 . So there's a whole lot of variety in there that we just don't really talk about."" He says influenza A seems to be the dominant strain at the moment. Queensland Chief Health Officer John Gerrard says the transmission of influenza has been significantly impacted by measures designed to slow the spread of coronavirus over the past two years. The result, he says, is we have not been been as exposed to the virus over the past two years as we normally would be. ""As our pandemic measures have relaxed, we are seeing increasing numbers of influenza and we are likely to see a significant wave of influenza on top of COVID-19 this winter,"" he said. On Wednesday, Queensland Health Minister Yvette D'Ath warned some people would get both COVID-19 and influenza at the same time She there was a ""great risk"" of it being ""life threatening"". ""We want to reduce these risks,"" she said. ""It's in your hands, it's easy: Get in and get your jab today."" Dr Mackay says we can expect a ""mixed bag"" of outcomes for people who get infected with both the flu and coronavirus. ""We've seen studies that say they're worse outcomes when you have more than one infection at a time, sometimes even better outcomes, and sometimes no different than if you have either one by itself,"" he said. ""So it's not really clear, based on the history of respiratory virus, how that will play out, and we just don't know enough yet about flu and corona together."" Dr Boulton says there have been reports of people infected with both viruses experiencing more severe symptoms. The influenza vaccine is now widely available at GPs and pharmacies, and Dr Boulton says now is a good time to get it. ""If you go and get it now, you'll be protected for that winter peak, so there's no need to delay,"" she said. Health authorities gear up for the first real flu season in three years, with experts particularly worried about the impact on young children. ""Also, there are some requirements. For example … if you have a relative in some of the aged care facilities, you will need to provide evidence that you've had a flu vaccine so that the residents are protected.""

201,The cancer some patients call the 'wellness disease' that kills half of those who have it within five years,health,"  More Australians dying of myeloma, a blood cancer that causes bones to weaken Juggling study, raising four children, and moving house all sounded like reasons as to why Bernadette Savonoff was so tired. She spent a year blaming fatigue on her busy life, before doctors diagnosed her with myeloma — a form of blood cancer that affects bone marrow. ""I had absolutely no idea what myeloma was,"" she said. ""It was heartbreaking. ""We had to grapple with the thought that could have my name on it and take me away from my family."" The now 48-year-old's condition is currently stable, thanks to years of treatment including chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant and daily medication. She is one of the lucky ones. Six Australians a day are diagnosed with myeloma and about half will die from the disease within five years, according to the Cancer Council. But the way the symptoms present means many people don't know they're sick until it's too late. Some myeloma patients call the cancer the ""wellness disease"" because people's symptoms are often not visible. But the deadly cancer can have severe impacts on the body. The disease is known to weaken bones, causing them to break. Other symptoms include anaemia, infections, and kidney damage. Before Wendy Pfeifer was diagnosed with myeloma in the 1990s, doctors didn't think she had the cancer because it was traditionally found in older men. ""I did look well enough. I did look as if I wasn't sick,"" she said. ""The fatigue and the bone pain were bad, but that was all in my mind as far as I was being told by medicos."" Instead, the mother of five was admitted to a psychiatric ward, wrongly treated for menopause and Ross River Fever, before being diagnosed with the blood cancer a year later. ""In 1996 when I was diagnosed there was no treatment because they used to treat over-70s, they didn't treat anyone under 70,"" she said. ""The treatment you were [then] given was palliative … drugs have changed dramatically."" Myeloma is a relatively rare disease. It accounts for approximately 1 per cent of all cancers and 10 per cent of all blood and bone marrow cancers. And while treatments and medications have improved over the years, the mortality rate is worsening. At the moment, about 1,000 people die from the disease each year. The number of Australians killed by myeloma is expected to almost triple by 2035, but experts say that is in part likely because more cases are being identified. Chris Tanti, the chief executive of the Leukemia Foundation, said it was unclear why the numbers were increasing. ""But it might be because of early detection because GPs are better at picking it up and the tests are more sophisticated,"" he said. ""I think people confuse or conflate myeloma and melanoma. The Leukemia Foundation did a survey of people to see if they knew the signs of symptoms of the blood cancer and four out of five people didn't know."" Last year, Nigel and Belinda Shedden got married and moved into their dream home. Today, the couple are living with Mr Shedden's mother in small apartment. In most cases, people who are diagnosed with myeloma have no family history of the disease and the cause remains unknown. The most common symptoms patients experience are bone pain, persistent tiredness and increased or unexplained bleeding or bruising. Mr Tanti said the speed at which COVID-19 vaccines were developed has given patients hope a cure for their illness would eventually be found. The Leukemia Foundation is hoping increased awareness of the disease will encourage more money to be spent on funding research and a potential cure. ""When you think about COVID … given the money was invested in COVID and when you think about how quickly we came up with a vaccine, I think if we invest the right amount of money in the right research, we can find a cure,"" Mr Tanti said.

202,NSW Now: Chemical spill causes traffic delays,health,"  Sydney news: A chemical spill causes traffic delays in Parramatta; Eastlakes man critical after hit and run Here's what you need to know this morning. A major chemical spill is causing significant traffic delays on James Ruse Drive, near Parramatta, in Sydney's west. Fire and Rescue New South Wales said it appears a substance spilled after falling off a truck, generating strong vapour and corroding the road's surface. Northbound lanes of James Ruse Drive, near the M4 overpass, are affected. The incident is causing major traffic delays and the clean-up is expected to take some time. Superintendent Adam Dewberry from Fire and Rescue NSW said the impact on traffic would be severe. All lanes on the road are closed and diversions onto the M4 are in place. The finalists in ""Australia's favourite art award"", the Archibald Prize, will be announced at 11am today. Awarded to the best portrait painting, it's a who's who of Australian culture, from politicians to celebrities, sporting heroes to artists. The packing room prize will also be announced. Melbourne artist Peter Wegner won last year's Archibald Prize for his portrait of fellow artist and previous Archibald winner Guy Warren. Last year's Archibald Prize was the 100th anniversary of the portrait award and, for the first time in its history, saw more women than men as finalists. The New South Wales government will today receive a much-anticipated report outlining the state of healthcare in remote, rural and regional communities and what needs to be done to fix that. An upper house committee has finished 18 months of its inquiry and is tabling its report at state parliament at 10am. Committee member and Greens MP Cate Faehrmann has previously promised the committee will be preparing ""bloody solid recommendations"" for the government, including the newly appointed Regional Health Minister. The inquiry has heard NSW Health has been surprised that its efforts to improve medical care for the bush are not working. A former SAS patrol commander codenamed Person 29 will continue giving evidence in the defamation case of war veteran Ben Roberts-Smith today. The Victoria Cross recipient claims several stories published in The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Canberra Times newspapers in 2018 contained false allegations of unlawful killings, bullying and domestic violence. Person 29 has become the third witness called by Mr Roberts-Smith's legal team to back up evidence there were no Taliban insurgents found in a secret tunnel at a compound raided in 2009, where publisher Nine alleges two unarmed prisoners were executed. An elderly man has been left lying on the road with critical injuries, after what police suspect was a hit and run incident in the Sydney suburb of Eastlakes. The 74-year-old man was found on Wednesday morning on the roadway at an intersection and is now fighting for life in hospital.

203,'It is all hands on deck': COVID leaves Brisbane schools facing critical teacher shortage,health,"  A large Brisbane state school is experiencing a ""critical"" shortage of teachers as COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc across the education sector. In a letter sent to families this week, Stretton State College executive principal Jan Maresca said the school had seen a ""significant increase"" in the number of staff and students contracting the virus. ""Currently, all schools are experiencing a critical supply teacher shortage and it is sometimes very difficult to find a relief teacher to cover the number of classes required due to teacher absence,"" Ms Maresca said. ""There is a limited number of replacement staff available for contracts and supply teaching at the moment, however we are working together to find the best possible staffing solutions for our students."" The letter told parents the school was relying on the ""goodwill"" of leadership staff to ensure students were actively engaged in dynamic teaching and learning. ""It is all hands on deck at the moment,"" it said. Stretton State College is a prep to grade 12 independent public school in Brisbane's south with more than 3,000 students. Parent Weina Huang was surprised by the letter. Her daughter, grade 2 student Melody Chen, has not been affected. ""So far she's fine,"" Ms Huang said. Queensland Health figures reveal 6,083 school-aged children have tested positive to COVID-19 in the past week. Of those, 1,225 were confirmed cases yesterday, the highest figure over the seven days. During the Omicron wave at the start of the year, there were between 1,000 and 1,500 cases a day in school-aged children. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said they expected ongoing cases in schools throughout the state. ""Schools will make local decisions to accommodate any staff absences and ensure students continue to learn and remain engaged,"" the spokesperson said. Independent Education Union branch secretary Terry Burke said several schools had been hit by COVID-19 outbreaks since the start of term two. ""There are quite substantial challenges,"" he said.

204,Man who sexually abused daughter twice acquitted after arguing he was asleep,health,"  Man acquitted of daughter's sexual abuse because he experienced 'sexsomnia' in his sleep A second court has ruled a man who twice sexually abused his young daughter should be acquitted of the charges because he was asleep at the time. The man, known as DB, told the NSW District Court last year he experienced ""sexsomnia"" and the sexual assaults he perpetrated in 2019 were completely involuntary. He pleaded not guilty to charges of sexual intercourse with, and sexual touching of, a child, saying the acts were caused by parasomnia, which is akin to sleepwalking. Last week a bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal (CCA) upheld the not guilty verdicts handed down after a judge-alone trial in April 2021, with two of the three justices agreeing it was the correct decision. Prosecutors had appealed the verdicts arguing the trial judge was wrong in finding DB was not suffering from a mental impairment causing a ""disturbance of volition"" when he abused his child. The Crown argued for the special verdict of ""act proven but not criminally responsible"" to be made under the Mental Health and Cognitive Impairment Forensic Provisions Act. Justice Helen Wilson, the lone dissenting member of the CCA bench, agreed with the Crown that the evidence showed DB had been affected from a disturbance of volition under the Act. She proposed to quash the verdicts and order a retrial, but her view was in the minority. Legal academic Elyse Methven said the dissenting judgement of Justice Wilson was in the spirit of the new Act introduced in 2021 to protect the public while modernising the approach to mental health in NSW’s court system. ""Her Honour took into account the purpose of the provision, which clearly has community safety in mind,"" she said. ""It shows how the new legislation can lead to informed minds logically coming to very different conclusions."" Dr Methven, senior lecturer at the Law Faculty of the University of Technology Sydney, said there was a ""significant"" difference between an acquittal and the special verdict, which may result in indefinite incarceration. If the special verdict is delivered, a person could be held indefinitely if it's believed they posed a risk to the community. An acquittal allows the person to walk free. The concept of ""automatism"", or involuntariness, is not an uncommon defence in the law and has featured in high-profile cases including car crashes, rape and murder. Dr Methven said one famous example was the 1992 Parks case in Canada where a man drove 20 kilometres to the home of his in-laws, bludgeoned his mother-in-law to death and attacked his father-in-law. Parks was acquitted as he performed the acts while in a state of parasomnia. In 2019, a father and son from Sydney's northern beaches were acquitted at trial of a bizarre pub rampage after a judge found the men had not acted voluntarily. Michael and Dean McGlinchey hopped from pub to pub challenging people to fights and assaulting several patrons on June 11, 2017. Their actions, which included Dean McGlinchey breaking a pub stool over a man's head, weren't disputed when they appeared before the courts. The father Michael McGlinchey argued he had entered an automaton state without control of his actions due to ""manic"" side effects of anti-depressants. Psychiatric experts said those side effects were rare but possible and could have explained the incidents labelled ""savage, unprovoked and seriously disturbing"" by Judge Ian McClintock. Judge McClintock ultimately found the Crown hadn't proved Michael McGlinchey had acted voluntarily, while he ruled Dean McGlinchey was experiencing paranoid hallucinations. ""I think the public would be shocked to learn what some people can do while they're asleep, and the results in some of these cases,"" Dr Methven said. In DB's trial, it was not disputed he touched his daughter sexually on at least two separate occasions in June and November 2019. Nor was there argument about whether he was asleep and had no control over his actions. Both times he touched his daughter, then aged 9, while sharing a bed with her. On the second occasion the girl had come into her father's room in the middle of the night after being woken by loud noises outside. She asked if she could sleep with him, he said yes before apparently falling asleep and abusing her. She left the room shocked and returned to her bed. The man was arrested the next day after the girl returned to her mother's house and the incident was reported to police. The girl told police her father was snoring during at least one of the incidents. But prosecutors alleged DB's sexsomnia was an ongoing mental health impairment causing the incidents, which could occur again in the future. The defence argued someone suffering from a parasomnia had a complete ""absence of volition"" and an otherwise sound mind. Trial judge Richard Weinstein ultimately found the prosecution had failed to prove on the balance of probabilities any mental health impairment had been at play. It was concluded the man was merely asleep, and therefore not criminally responsible for his actions. ""Thus that Act has no application in the circumstances, and I enter verdicts of not guilty to the [charges],"" Judge Weinstein said. Dr Methven described the majority judgement in DB as a “technical” interpretation of the Act which may set a new precedent in NSW for similar cases. She added it may have also exposed a ""gap in the law"" and believed a further appeal to the High Court could follow. ""Clearly some will be concerned that an acquittal was not the right result for this man,"" she said. ""The case exposes a potential gap in the law. And certain violent or sexual acts might fall through the cracks.""

205,"If legal and safe abortion is banned again in the US, how could that affect Australian women?",health,"  The end of Roe v Wade would likely embolden global anti-abortion activists and politicians A leaked United States Supreme Court draft opinion reveals it is poised to strike down Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that guaranteed abortion as a constitutional right. The end of Roe v Wade would dramatically impact reproductive rights in the US. It would also likely have symbolic consequences globally, shaping the strategies and tactics of the trans-national anti-abortion movement. Overturning Roe v Wade would put the US Supreme Court out of step with public sentiment. Abortion is a routine and safe health-care procedure accessed by approximately one in four American women. 2021 polling indicated 80 per cent of Americans support abortion in all or most cases, and at least 60 per cent support Roe v Wade. If Roe v Wade falls, abortion will be returned to the states for regulation. About half the states are expected to immediately ban abortion; 16 states plus the District of Columbia have laws protecting abortion rights. In the short term, a patient's ability to legally access abortion would effectively be a lottery, determined by geography or having the financial resources to travel significant distances. In the longer term, opponents of abortion view this moment as a beginning rather than an end. Republican lawmakers are already strategising about legislation that would ban abortion nationwide after six weeks' gestation. Although Australia is sometimes described as the 51st US state, when it comes to abortion our politics and laws are extremely different. The Australian public is strongly pro-choice and has been for decades. Abortion in Australia is regulated by state and territory legislation and the overall trend in the 21st century has been to enshrine abortion as a legal right. In 2021, South Australia became the last jurisdiction to decriminalise the procedure. A historic bill to decriminalise abortion in South Australia passes the State Parliament's Lower House, following a heated and lengthy debate. Politically, abortion is the subject of conscience votes. It normally does not function as a partisan issue for the major parties, with the notable exception of the 2020 Queensland election, when the LNP promised a review of the recently passed abortion decriminalisation law while One Nation pledged to roll it back. When asked about Roe v Wade issue today, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""I'm aware of the reports that are coming out of the United States, but that's in a different country. In Australia there are no changes to those laws."" But while legal abortion in Australia seems secure, we are still a long way from treating abortion as the routine health care it is. In most of Australia, patients needing abortion care face significant barriers to access. With the exception of South Australia and the Northern Territory, most public hospitals do not offer abortion care. Instead, private clinics provide abortion services and patients pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket. Access to abortion services outside major cities is almost non-existent. Regional patients face immense logistical barriers and travel and procedure costs. The pandemic inadvertently led to the permanent closure of regional abortion clinics in Queensland and New South Wales. Telehealth services for early medication abortion can sometimes help but shouldn't be the only option. Broadly, there is a significant shortage of trained surgical abortion providers. Although early medication abortion can be prescribed by GPs, very few are certified to do so. Until COVID, many private regional abortion clinics relied on doctors working on a fly-in-fly-out model. Reproductive rights advocates have repeatedly called on governments to embed this essential reproductive health care into public health services. In the 2019 federal election, Labor promised ""free abortions"" via a major sexual and reproductive health policy but has not revisited this proposal in the current campaign. While Australia does not share the US' intense partisan politics over abortion, we also do not share the approach of Canada where abortion is normalised as reproductive health care. There has also been a disturbing domestic trend towards the increasing political stigmatisation of abortion. The tiny Australian right-to-life movement has direct links with the US movement. In recent state decriminalisation debates, we witnessed the wholesale incorporation of American rhetoric and tactics into the Australian context. Anti-abortion activists had an out-sized place in these state debates because of their vocal political and religious allies. Minor parties such as One Nation now have a ""pro-life platform"", while several federal Coalition politicians, including Barnaby Joyce, Alex Antic and Matt Canavan have spoken out against abortion. Amanda Stoker, the assistant minister for women, recently addressed the annual Queensland anti-choice rally. The end of Roe v Wade will likely embolden our own anti-abortion activists and politicians, who can question public provision of abortion, push for additional legal and medical regulations, and seek to revise laws by emphasising US talking points such as ""late-term"" and ""sex-selective"" abortions. Legislatively eroding abortion is a strategy that has proven immensely successful in the US. It ensures abortion is not viewed as health care, that anti-choice rhetoric is amplified in mainstream media, and that abortion patients and providers are further stigmatised. Cumulatively, these tactics have a chilling effect that will likely make access to abortion even harder. If the US Supreme Court overturns Roe v Wade this year, it will mean the end of a decision that has survived 49 years worth of hostile legal challenges. It demonstrates the power and danger of long-term tactics relying on stigma and the gradual erosion of rights. It reminds us all that rights must be continually defended, never taken for granted.

206,I have COVID-19. What happens now? Here's what to do,health,"  You've felt that first tingle of a sore throat. Or, you've been hit with a headache that's knocked you out for an entire day. After getting tested, you find out — you're COVID-positive. We may be two years into a pandemic with restrictions and lockdowns easing across the country, but that doesn't mean COVID-19 isn't still circulating. Here are some things to think about that will help you get through it. From the moment you test positive for COVID-19, you need to self-isolate, stay at your home or accommodation and remain separated from people for at least 7 full days from the date you had your test. Unless it's for medical care, an emergency or an allowed purpose, you cannot leave your house or accommodation. If you live with other people, NSW Health recommends avoiding common areas, sleeping alone and using a separate bathroom if these options are available to you. But if you can't avoid using common areas: disinfect surfaces you touch and try to avoid occupying the same room as another member of the household. You'll need to inform people you've recently been in contact with of your positive test, and advise them to monitor their symptoms. Under the national cabinet definition, you are a close contact if you: Different states and territories have different requirements for close contacts, so visit the health department website of your location to see what rules apply to you. The Australian Department of Health says the common symptoms you should expect include a headache, fatigue, cough, sore throat, fever and loss of taste or smell. Some people can contract COVID-19 without experiencing symptoms at all. Queensland Health advises the following to manage these symptoms at home: Pro-tip: Prepare a COVID pack ahead of time in case you need to isolate, so you'll already have everything at home if you test positive. In a small number of people, symptoms may worsen and require hospital care. According to NSW Health, you should call triple-0 immediately if you develop the following severe symptoms: The Department of Health advises the infectious period varies from person to person. Generally, people are considered to be infectious from 48 hours before symptoms start. In high-risk settings, they may be considered infectious from 72 hours before symptoms start. How soon after catching COVID-19 can you get it again? Here's what we know about reinfection. People with mild illness are considered to be recovered after 7 days, if they have been asymptomatic or have not developed any new symptoms during this time. Whereas people at higher risk of serious illness may take weeks to recover. If a person develops long-term health problems caused by COVID-19, symptoms most commonly continue for 2 to 8 weeks after infection. Among Ibuprofen and herbal teas, your COVID kit should also include activities to keep yourself occupied. Books, puzzles, a series to binge or games you can play by yourself are all things you can do to pass the time while you're on the mend.

207,No 'clear vision' and a primary care system about to 'crumble' — and experts say the parties have been ignoring one key factor,health,"  When it comes to managing your health, the first person you might turn to is your GP. General practitioners cover everything from acute illnesses like infections and flu, as well as chronic conditions such as depression and diabetes. Yet so far, there's been very little in this election campaign on how either party would improve and fund access to quality GP care. ""We've seen really no clear vision about how the very clear challenges that are here with us now are going to be addressed by a future government,"" Australian Medical Association president Dr Omar Khorsid said. Experts say to keep people out of hospital, we need a major shift to focus on prevention, as well as putting GPs at the centre of people's care. For example, multi-disciplinary care could mean you have access to a diabetes nurse educator, a podiatrist, an exercise physiologist or a psychologist, in a one-stop-shop of sorts. Leanne Wells, chief executive of advocacy group the Consumer Health Forum, says the key is allowing GPs to coordinate the care of their patients, including visits to allied health — ideally in the form of an all-in-one medical hub. ""Team care arrangements through a general practice, funded to a better level, would far better meet the needs of people [with complex chronic conditions or multiple comorbidities] who need that complete primary care,"" she said. For this to happen though, the current fee-for-service model would need to change. ""If we can bolster primary health care and its capacity to respond better … we're going to make greater inroads into keeping the pressure off our hospital system,"" Ms Wells said. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au Leading doctors' groups support a shake-up to primary care, with a voluntary ""medical home"" system to promote continuity of care and allied health under one roof. Dr Khorshid says having well-funded primary care helps reduce the pressure on hospitals too. ""We know if these chronic diseases are managed better it will keep people out of hospitals and reduce the number of expensive investigations required,"" he said. But so far, there's been nothing like that from either side. Instead, plans to reduce the cost of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits System (PBS) have been announced by both parties. Labor's plan is to cut costs of medicines on the PBS by $12.50 — going slightly further than the Coalition's plan to cut prices by $10. Both proposals would make medicines cheaper, particularly for people with chronic conditions who take medication on a regular basis. Hundreds of thousands of Australians don't fill scripts because of the cost. Will the government's proposed changes help? The proposals are welcomed by patient groups. ""We know that people are forgoing healthcare because they have to buy food and petrol and pay their rent, so anything that can make medications more affordable is a really good measure,"" Ms Wells said. Labor has promised to deliver at least 50 Urgent Care Clinics to help take pressure off emergency departments, and also says it will set up an Australian Centre for Disease Control to prepare for future pandemics. The Coalition says it supports GPs and patients through making telehealth permanent at a cost of $5 billion. It's pledged $146 million for rural health, to boost the work-force and increase access to services in regional Australia. The Coalition has promised billions since the royal commission, but Labor is making aged care an election issue. Labor says it will support GPs by expanding the overseas-trained and bonded doctor access to Medicare, ensuring more GPs work in outer suburban and regional centres. ""This will make it easier for Australians to see a GP in large parts of outer-metro and regional Australia,"" a Labor spokesperson said. Some announcements have been made for mental health care too. The Coalition says it will fund a youth-led mental health organisation, and Labor says it will restore regional and rural telehealth psychiatry appointments. Both parties have also promised billions to improve aged care. But when it comes to primary care, so far, nothing major has been announced. And that's frustrated many in the health sector. Health economist Angela Jackson said it was disappointing that health wasn't a bigger focus this election campaign, especially after COVID-19. She said while the announced initiatives were welcome, they didn't address what the system fundamentally needs. ""Which political party is going to deliver a health system that is more equitable, but is sustainable going forward? I think these are the questions that Australians want answered,"" Dr Jackson said. ""They want to know that when they need healthcare they're going to get it, and they're not going to have to wait, and they're not going to pay huge out of pocket costs. ""These reforms are long overdue, and we really need to get going if we're going to beat the wave of the ageing population that's coming."" Ms Wells is also hoping to see bigger announcements for the healthcare system. ""We need to bolster primary care, not let it continue to crumble,"" she said.

208,Study prompts concerns about antibiotic resistance in the food chain,health,"  Antibiotic resistance detected in the food chain could have implications for human health, new study finds A new study has found surprisingly high rates of antibiotic resistance in samples of salmon and beef purchased from Australian supermarkets. The study, shared exclusively with 7.30, was commissioned by animal rights not-for-profit World Animal Protection and carried out by researchers at Melbourne's Monash University. The researchers looked at how well antibiotics worked against bacteria in salmon and beef and also searched for what antibiotic-resistant genes the micro-organisms might be harbouring. These genes can jump between bacteria, and from bacteria to humans through consumption. ""Alternatively, you would also have these genes potentially passing into wastewater, for instance, and then also causing environmental contamination,"" said Associate Professor Chris Greening from Monash University. Fifty-five per cent of the beef samples and 39 per cent of the salmon samples were found to be harbouring resistance to a range of commonly used antibiotics. ""It's a concern. The levels of antimicrobial resistance in these meats was much, much more than we were expecting,"" Mr Greening said. ""We can't really conclude exactly how the antimicrobial resistance in these meats was acquired. ""What's clear is, because of the very high levels of antimicrobial resistance, they're probably exposed to antibiotics at some point, but we can't determine in what context and for what purpose."" It's possible that cooking the meat reduces the risk of transmission. But Mr Greening said not enough was being done to monitor antibiotic resistance in the food chain. ""What Australia desperately needs is basically an integrated surveillance system for both antimicrobial usage as well as antimicrobial resistance levels,"" he said. ""We also need to be looking at animal health, we need to be looking at food, we need to be looking at [the] environment."" Food Standards Australia New Zealand said it would be monitoring antibiotic resistance from June 2022 as part of a new study looking at antibiotic resistance in Australian food. It said it was analysing the research from Monash University. Coles, Woolworths, and Aldi all declined to be interviewed. In a statement, a spokesperson for Woolworths said the company takes food safety seriously and relies on ""the expert guidance of national authorities who set science-based regulations for the livestock industry and animal medicine"". The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment also told 7.30 in a statement that the study's findings ""are not reflective of current antimicrobial usage practices"" in Australia's beef or salmon industry. Antibiotic resistance is becoming a global problem that could make infections much harder to treat. ""Antibiotic resistance is where antibiotics no longer work because bacteria produce chemicals that inactivate the antibiotic, and that's a real problem,"" said Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at the Canberra Hospital. ""There's people already dying around the world because they're getting infections that we can no longer treat. ""And as the projections go for the future, they're talking about millions of extra people dying per year because antibiotics don't work. ""It just shows why we have to be very careful with the volumes of antibiotics we allow to be used, the types that are used, and how we let it spread. ""If we don't have transparency of what's happening with real-time or near real-time data, then it's very hard to police this."" The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) said it is responsible for approving antibiotics, but that it is up to state and territory regulators to monitor how much is used. A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture also told 7.30 that the department is in the initial planning stage for ""a nationally coordinated One Health Surveillance System that will collect and report on antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use"" across sectors including agriculture, food and animal health. Bryce Camm runs his family's cattle company in Queensland's Darling Downs. He's well aware that antibiotic resistance is a serious issue, and says he tries to limit his use of antibiotics. The only part of Mr Camm's business where antibiotics are used is to treat disease among cattle in the feedlot. ""We'll use antibiotics when we have a beast with an ailment, that might have had a cut or an abrasion,"" Mr Camm said. ""Or it might have a respiratory [illness] or something like what we would call the flu in humans. ""Before we can use an antibiotic on any animal, it has to be authorised or signed off by a veterinarian. ""So Australia has some of the lowest usage of antibiotics in the world."" Mr Camm says he is working hard to avoid making the problem of antibiotic resistance worse. ""Antimicrobial resistance in the management of antibiotics, both in human health and animal health, is an emerging issue globally,"" he said. ""[It is] something that the beef industry ... takes very seriously. ""We understand how crucial it is to maintain the efficacy of those important medicines that we have today. ""We're always very conscious of emerging issues for consumers and ensuring that we're delivering a safe and nutritious product onto the plate. ""And hence, we have been world-leading in implementing stewardship guidelines around the use of antibiotics."" A Department of Agriculture spokesperson told 7.30 that Australia had adopted ""one of the most conservative approaches to the use of antimicrobials in agriculture in the world"", and that the registration process for antibiotics for use on food-producing animals takes a ""science and risk-based approach"". ""Australia has a national antimicrobial resistance strategy that reflects the shared responsibility of human health, agriculture and environment and the best available scientific knowledge of this topic,"" the statement said.

210,"'It's personal': From Outback lake to the English Channel, this grazier's challenge is all about turning the tide",health,"  Attempt to cross English Channel beckons for Outback grazier and Lifeline ambassador Brendan Cullen Brendan Cullen frequently swims the length of the now-flourishing Lake Menindee, as he inches closer to taking on the challenge of a lifetime. Mr Cullen from Kars Station, east of Broken Hill, has been training to swim the English Channel. ""It was just an idea that was put to me jokingly by my now coach,"" he says. ""After training for a period of time I had a bit of a light-bulb moment and thought, 'I might give this a go'."" After countless pandemic-fuelled disruptions, he has finally qualified to attempt one of the world's most historically significant and iconic marathon swims. Only three years ago the Far West grazier would swim across what was the last-remaining body of water in the Menindee Lakes system, Copi Hollow. But widespread rains and northern inflows in 2021 saw parts of the system reach 100-per-cent capacity for the first time since 2012, and now Mr Cullen trains across the abundant lakes system. To qualify, Mr Cullen swam 11,260 strokes, or 16 kilometres, across Melbourne's Port Phillip Bay on April 29. ""Mentally, for me to be able to swim six hours in 16-degree [Celsius] water gave me a little bit of confidence to know that I might be able to stick it out for the duration of the channel swim,"" he said. The full English Channel swim stretches 33km and can take anywhere from seven to 27 hours to swim. Inspired by his brother as well as endurance swimming legend Michael Gregory, the Lifeline ambassador hopes to not only conquer the Channel, but advocate for men's mental health and the benefits of swimming. ""There's one thing I love doing and that's being able to help people out. It's been ingrained in my whole life."" Mr Cullen said swimming became a way for him to improve his mental health, after suffering from his own battle with depression during years of severe drought. ""It [swimming] has mental health benefits for me, I don't know where I would be without it."" ""I watched my brother do a swim — Bondi to Bronte — and it was inspiring to be quite honest, and I thought, 'I got to jump in the water and swim'."" ""It's just something that's now got personal and now it's a matter of trying to tick that box."" Mr Cullen said the unpredictability of the swim meant he did not feel overly confident for his swim at the end of July, but coaching from the Broken Hill Aquatic Stingrays team, and Gregory — one of Australia's most experienced open-water swimmers — has left him feeling well-equipped. ""On the day anything can happen, and there's plenty of stories so all I can do is keep bashing away at it and come out the other side with a successful crossing,"" he said. ""Michael [Gregory]'s credentials are quite something else. He's swum the channel four times, he swam Loch Ness one of only 12 people in the world to ever swim that."" ""One of his great sayings is: 'swim until you hit something', so basically when you get in the water don't stop until you hit France.""

211,'No hope of survival': Coroner finds breech baby died after hospital 'mismanagement',health,"  Tasmanian coroner finds birth of breech baby mismanaged by Launceston General Hospital before death A baby died in a Tasmanian hospital after a ""traumatic"" birth that was mismanaged by health staff who carried out a C-section too late, a coroner has found. CONTENT WARNING: This story contains details that may cause distress Luke* was born at the Launceston General Hospital (LGH) in the state's north in October 2019. In his findings into Luke's death, coroner Simon Cooper described the birth as a ""traumatic labour process"". The baby's mother Sandra* had gone to the LGH for a planned appointment at an antenatal clinic and was found to be in the early stages of labour. Her pregnancy was at 39 weeks and three days. Mr Cooper said an examination by midwives showed the baby was in breech position and Sandra was immediately admitted to the hospital for an emergency caesarean section, also known as a C-section. ""LGH medical records indicate [Sandra] was 'keen' for a caesarean section,"" he wrote. A report to the coroner by an obstetrics specialist said there was a period of around 25 minutes where a ""comparatively straightforward caesarean section"" could have been performed. However, Mr Cooper said initial attempts were made by an obstetrician to deliver the baby vaginally, before a another consultant obstetrician was called in to help. Various manoeuvres were unsuccessfully attempted before a C-section was undertaken to free up the baby's arms and head. He said this proved successful in the sense that Luke was able to be born vaginally shortly after, but he was ""critically unwell"". ""After approximately 15 minutes of resuscitation, [Luke] was transferred to the LGH neonatal intensive care unit and then flown to the RHH [Royal Hobart Hospital] in the early hours of the next morning,"" he said. ""Unfortunately his prognosis was poor due to a hypoxic ischaemic [brain] injury he had suffered during birth."" A decision was made to place Luke in palliative care and he died on the 3rd of November, 2019. After formal identification of the baby's body, Luke was transferred to the hospital mortuary. An autopsy the following day found the cause of death was global hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. Obstetrics expert Dr Jonathan Nettle was asked to review the circumstances of Luke's short life. He reported that Luke's birth was a ""difficult clinical situation that appears to have been made worse by poor clinical decision-making which did not adhere to standard relevant guidelines"". ""There were multiple opportunities presented to staff present to take an alternative course of action that would have likely avoided the final outcome."" Dr Nettle also found that a ""clear clinical assessment of suitability for attempting vaginally breech birth was not conducted"". He said at anytime between 3.03pm — when Sandra's membranes ruptured — and 3.29pm, it would have been possible to perform a comparatively straightforward caesarean section. Coroner Cooper concluded that Luke's birth was ""mismanaged at the LGH"". ""In contrast, the care and treatment he received after his birth, both at the LGH and at the RHH was of an appropriate standard,"" he said. ""However, by then, the hypoxic brain injury he had suffered during birth meant he had no hope of survival."" The LGH told the coroner it was investing in a simple ultrasound unit that midwives and medical staff would be trained to use for the confirmation of foetal presentation. In a statement, Dr Peter Renshaw, executive director of medical services at the hospital, said: ""We acknowledge the deeply distressing nature of this case and note the comments of the coroner."" ""Unfortunately, in this case, the baby was not recognised to be presenting as a breech (bottom first) until the mother was in labour, resulting in complications in the delivery of the baby. ""The Launceston General Hospital reviewed the case and has introduced a quick scan at the end of pregnancy where there is any doubt about the baby's presentation. ""As the coroner referred to, the LGH has also made changes to the provision of ultrasound machines, investing in simple, portable handheld ultrasound devices to be used in various settings. The devices connect with a tablet screen and are more straightforward for staff to use than existing ward-based ultrasound machines."" Dr Renshaw said the hospital was ""committed to continuous improvement and will carefully consider the coroner's report, noting no recommendations were made"". The hospital did not respond to specific questions about the 25-minute window for the C-section, or what the coroner described as ""poor clinical decision-making"" by hospital staff. *Names have been changed.

212,Former Eagles star Ashley Sampi confirms 'hard and overwhelming' MS diagnosis,health," Sport Former West Coast Eagles player and AFL mark of the year winner Ashley Sampi reveals he has multiple sclerosis Former West Coast Eagles player Ashley Sampi has revealed he has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). The 38-year-old Sampi played 78 games for West Coast between 2002 and 2006, kicking 97 goals for the club and playing in the 2005 grand final against Sydney. Sampi is best known for taking the AFL's mark of the year in 2004 for a stunning leap on the shoulders of teammate Andrew Embley against Melbourne at the MCG. He made the announcement about his health on the Facebook page of his uncle, the actor and entertainer Ernie Dingo. He apologised to family and friends for not telling people individually, saying it ""would've been too hard to let you all know what I am going through and what my path for the future holds"" for him, his wife Gerri and their children. ""Last Tuesday I was diagnosed with (MS) multiple sclerosis, the diagnosis was hard and overwhelming to take in but I have such great support around me I know I will be OK,"" he said. Sampi said he was joining the MS Foundation's charity challenge for May, which calls on people to walk, run or cycle 50km and raise funds to support MS — his goal for the month is to hit the 100km mark. ""Anybody can join hopefully with family and friends joining and with donations to 'Team Sampi' I will raise some money to help with the fight for MS. If we can raise more than my target goal it will be truly appreciated, thanks for your help and donation and your support."" The Team Sampi fundraising page had an initial target of $6,000 — that target has already been exceeded, with $7,192 donated by early Wednesday afternoon. ""I know it sounds bad but Gerri and I are in good spirits and with the neurologists and my treatment plan put in place I look forward and not behind and with the grace of God can live somewhat of a normal life for myself and my family,"" Sampi said. He said he and his family were still coming to terms with the diagnosis, and asked for time and help in his fundraising efforts. ""I know that you all will want answers I guess but please try and hold off,"" he said. ""I thank you all for your love and care and for your support.""

213,"South Australia records 3,591 COVID-19 cases as death toll jumps by a dozen",health,"  South Australia's COVID-19 death toll has jumped by 12, after SA Health retrospectively included previously unrecorded deaths that occurred over the past three weeks. The deaths were of five women and seven men aged from their 70s to their 90s. SA Health said the updated statistics were because of ""data reconciliation"" that had occurred since April 19. ""Sadly, since the last report, SA Health has been notified that 12 people who tested positive for COVID-19, have passed away,"" it said. SA today recorded 3,591 new cases, almost 400 more than yesterday, but coinciding with a rise in PCR testing. There are 221 people in hospital, including 11 in intensive care and one on ventilation. There are currently 22,821 active cases in SA, and have been 420,264 since the start of the pandemic. The 12 deaths take the state's total to 366, and come days after Premier Peter Malinauskas expressed concern about the prevalence of COVID in aged care homes. ""We know that once COVID gets into an aged care setting, it's very hard to get it out,"" he said on Saturday. ""But this is something we're going to monitor."" Yesterday, it was reported that two new COVID variants had been detected in the state for the first time, after genomic sampling had found the virus in two international travellers. Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said there was ""no reason to believe"" that the vaccines would prove less effective against the new variants, in terms of reducing the severity of illness and the need for hospitalisation. Professor Spurrier also issued a reminder about the upcoming flu season, indicating that it would likely be the most severe for several years. She said that, during the last two years, COVID restrictions had led to reductions in influenza numbers. ""Our international borders were shut — flu tends to come in from the northern hemisphere,"" she said. ""At the same time last year, we'd had 12 cases of flu notified. We've now got 187. ""I can't imagine how unwell you would feel if you ended up with both flu and COVID, either at the same time or one after the other, and it's perfectly possible for that to happen.""

214,Jabs plea after Queenslanders with 'flurona' need hospitalisation,health,"  More than a dozen Queenslanders have already been hit with the double whammy of COVID-19 and flu virus infections in the past three weeks, most of them needing to be hospitalised. After getting her flu jab, Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said she was concerned about the ""life-threatening"" risk of Queenslanders being struck down with both viruses at once this winter. ""We're expecting a big flu season this year,"" she said. ""We are already seeing more flu cases this year than we had for the whole of 2021. Some people will end up getting COVID and influenza and this is of great risk. ""I know a lot of people who went out last year and got the flu shot simply because they were concerned that they may get COVID and flu. That risk is even greater now."" Eight more people died in the state with COVID-19 in the latest reporting period and 7,668 new cases were recorded. There are 504 people being treated in hospital with the virus, including 21 in intensive care. Chief Health Officer John Gerrard said more than 800 flu cases had already been confirmed in Queensland this year – up from the 296 cases recorded for the entirety of 2021. ""As we had suspected, as our pandemic measures have relaxed, we are seeing increasing numbers of cases of influenza and we are likely to see a significant wave of influenza on top of COVID-19 this winter,"" Dr Gerrard said. ""The combination of COVID-19 and influenza seems to be particularly severe."" When it comes to COVID, flu and vaccination, what's changed — and what hasn't — since last winter? Dr Gerrard urged Queenslanders to get a flu shot and to be up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines. ""Influenza … can be a severe disease,"" he said. ""I'm particularly concerned because all of our immunity will have waned over the last two years. Our general immunity is low and the virus is here and it's beginning to spread. ""If we get it, it's likely to be more severe."" Dr Gerrard said Queensland's hospitals were preparing for ""a difficult winter"". ""We always knew this was going to happen,"" he said. ""Queensland had to open up at some point and when it opened up, new viruses will be introduced. ""The last two years have been very aberrant. We've had very little influenza, a very low death rate over the winter … because we've been protected from the virus. ""But that couldn't last forever."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Ms D'Ath said 120 new paramedics were due to start this month in Queensland to help the state deal ""with the winter surge"" of infections. ""We are embarking and working on a broader workforce strategy to attract and retain doctors and nurses and other health professionals across the state,"" she said. ""We are constantly recruiting. Every state is struggling with workforce shortages."" Flu shots are free for children aged from six months to less than five years and for people aged 65 and over. They are also free for pregnant women, Indigenous Australians aged six months and older and people with chronic health conditions.

215,"SA's government wants to shift COVID powers, here's what it means",health,"  The State Government will introduce legislation to parliament today to amend the Public Health Act to include a ""baseline"" level of COVID-19 rules. Here's a look at what that means. Premier Peter Malinauskas said passing the amendments to the Public Health Act would enable the state to lift its emergency management declaration by June 30 — a declaration that has been in place for more than two years. Police Commissioner and State Emergency Coordinator Grant Stevens said he could relinquish his powers even sooner if the changes were pushed through parliament. ""There is the potential if this bill goes through — and there's an alternative mechanism to make sure people can be directed to do the right thing — I'll have to seriously consider whether there will be a need for another 28-day extension,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide today. ""And at this stage, being the optimist, I'm thinking there won't be."" Commissioner Stevens invoked South Australia's emergency declaration on March 22, 2020. That 14-day declaration was then extended by 28 days — a process which has taken place roughly every month since. The declaration gave Commissioner Stevens the power to impose restrictions on public and private activities, including lockdowns and density limits. The proposed legislative changes would allow SA Health to impose requirements on positive cases and close contacts. Commissioner Stevens said isolation requirements was one of the reasons the emergency declaration had continued to remain in place. ""One of the reasons we've maintained it is because we need to isolate people who are COVID positive … if this bill goes through, it will give SA Health the ability to make those directions to people who are positive,"" he said. Rules around vaccinations and masks in high-risk settings such as hospitals and aged and disability care would also remain under the legislation. Health Minister Chris Picton said keeping some COVID rules in place would protect the most vulnerable. ""If we didn't have this legislation in place and the emergency management ended, then all of those rules would disappear overnight and we wouldn't be able to protect the community and have rules in place for people who test positive for COVID for example,"" he said. Lockdowns, broad mask mandates and hospitality restrictions would no longer able to be imposed once the emergency declaration ends — unless another one is declared. The Commissioner will remain the State Emergency Coordinator, and can declare another emergency in the future if he deems it necessary. ""The potential for another human epidemic to impact on South Australians is still there and if that was to occur — even if it is COVID — and we saw a massive impact on our community, we saw devastating consequences in relation to mortality or our hospitals were overwhelmed, it is still within my authority to declare another major emergency,"" he said. ""So I can enliven the powers under the Emergency Management Act to get on top of that to prevent significant harm to the community and community members."" Commissioner Stevens would also remain on the COVID decision-making Emergency Management sub-committee, which also includes Chief Public Health Professor Nicola Spurrier and Premier Peter Malinauskas. The Commissioner said he was ""buoyed"" about his role potentially changing. ""That's the best sign of progress in terms of managing the pandemic that we've seen for a long time,"" he said. University of South Australia legal expert Sarah Moulds has raised concerns about the level of oversight included in the government's proposed legislation. A specialist in emergency COVID-19 lawmaking, Dr Moulds advocated for certain safeguards to be built into the Public Health Act amendments. She pointed to Victoria's controversial Pandemic Management Bill as a good example of legislation that allowed speedy response to emergency situations, while also being transparent and accountable. ""Really significantly, [the Victorian parliament] set up a pandemic response oversight committee,"" she said. ""If they think that one of the ministers, or one of the delegates or public servants have gone too far, that committee of parliamentarians can then say, 'Hey, the parliament needs to have another look at this'."" She also said Victoria's legislation had a ""disallowance"" mechanism, which effectively allowed the parliament to cancel legislation it did not agree with. ""[Disallowance] is something that changed the Victorian debate from one of concern — about just embedding the powers given to police commissioners — into something that people felt was really going to bring out a diversity of views and safeguards,"" she said.

216,David vs developer over disability access — and the developer just struck a High Court victory,health,"  High Court sides with developer Citta over Hobart Parliament Square disability access case A disability advocate says he feels like he has been ""kicked in the guts"" after the High Court ruled in favour of the developers of Hobart's $220 million Parliament Square precinct, in a long-running dispute over equal access. Parliament Square takes up almost a full block of the city and was touted as Tasmania's answer to Federation Square ahead of its construction. In a dispute that came to be dubbed a ""David and Goliath"" battle, disability advocate David Cawthorn has been fighting the square's developers, Citta Property Group, for almost six years over the site's accessibility. While there are two entrances with ramps, accessing them from the Hobart waterfront precinct requires a 35-metre uphill push for people using wheelchairs or prams. The entrance on the north-eastern corner, closest to the waterfront, only has stair access. Citta said the development complied with Commonwealth standards requiring 50 per cent of entrances, including the principal pedestrian entrance, to be accessible. But Mr Cawthorn made a complaint to Equal Opportunity Tasmania in 2016, saying it was discriminatory to not provide access to a public place and seeking the installation of a lift. The state's anti-discrimination tribunal found it could not hear the matter because it involved constitutional issues. Mr Cawthorn appealed to the Supreme Court to argue the issue could be heard by the tribunal, which found in his favour. But Citta took the matter to the High Court and, on Wednesday, the court agreed the state tribunal did not have the power to consider the issue. ""I'm really disappointed in the situation,"" Mr Cawthorn said. ""It just feels like I've been kicked in the guts."" In a statement, Citta Property Group managing director Stephen McMillan welcomed the High Court decision. ""We do not believe Parliament Square has been built in any way to discriminate against people with disability,"" he said. ""Our application to the High Court sought to resolve what was an untenable conflict between the Federal Premises Standards, the Federal Disability Discrimination Act and the State Anti-Discrimination Act."" Mr Cawthorn said while the developers had won their appeal, the crux of the case had not been dealt with. ""They've only won on a legal technicality, but not actually on the merits on the case about equal access for everyone,"" he said. ""That's the disappointing thing. ""All we've done is played around with what courts can hear the case."" Mr Cawthorn's lawyer, Ben Bartl, said the Tasmanian government had amended legislation so cases like Mr Cawthorn's that raised federal defences or constitutional issues could now be referred to the Magistrate's Court to be heard. Mr Cawthorn said he was going through the judgement with his pro-bono legal team. ""And I will seriously consider lodging a new complaint, as the equal access issue still has not been addressed. ""It's just not about me. It's about other people in the community, elderly people, parents with prams, people with a disability, trying to get up that hill."" Former disability discrimination commissioner Graeme Innes said the decision was disappointing, and Mr Cawthorn still had not had the merits of his case heard. ""Firstly, what we have is a David and Goliath situation here because we've got one man with a disability up against a very wealthy and well-resourced developer,"" Mr Innes said. ""In this case, the [access to premises] standards have worked very poorly for people with disabilities in Tasmania. ""The standards provide that you have to have 50 per cent of entrances accessible, and in general terms in a building, that's not a bad start. ""But for Parliament Square, which is effectively on that Hobart slope, the two entrances they've made accessible are the top two… but if you're down on the foreshore and wanting to come to Parliament Square, you effectively can't, if you can't push up a 35 metre-long hill. ""It seems as though the developers have technically complied. But in terms of fairness, they definitely haven't."" Mr Cawthorn does not have to pay costs.

217,"Just days after WA ditched masks and eased restrictions, COVID cases have hit a new peak",health,"  WA has recorded a new peak in daily COVID-19 cases, just days after relaxing almost all of its restrictions, but the government remains ""comfortable"" with the current rules. A total of 9,782 cases have been announced today, marginally higher than the previous peak of 9,754 infections recorded on March 29. They are part of 44,868 active cases in the state, about 6,000 fewer infections than reported on the day of the previous peak. Two historical deaths – a woman aged in her 90s and a man in his 70s – are included in today’s figures. Hospital cases remain relatively consistent with 242 coronavirus-positive patients across the state, including 10 in intensive care. The case surge follows WA removing many of its COVID-19 restrictions on Friday, including mask and proof-of-vaccination mandates and the need for asymptomatic close contacts to isolate. At the time those changes were announced, both Premier Mark McGowan and Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson indicated cases could rise as a result. ""I've spoken to the Chief Health Officer today, he's comfortable with the settings and [cases] are as predicted,"" Ms Sanderson said today. ""The number that matters is hospitalisations and ICU [admissions]."" Ms Sanderson pointed to hospital admissions remaining steady between about 240 and 250. ""I don't anticipate it to go much higher than that, but I do know it's putting pressure on our system and putting pressure on our staff,"" Ms Sanderson said. When asked last week, Mr McGowan said it was ""unlikely"" the mask mandate would be reintroduced but would not rule it out. WA takes a giant step towards living with COVID-19, as a whole raft of restrictions are removed. What is now playing out is exactly what the state's Chief Health Officer (CHO) warned of in his advice to the government about the latest changes. Andy Robertson wrote that introducing those changes ""should be considered … only in the full knowledge that this may have the effect of increasing cases and hospitalisations in the short to medium term with the potential for further peaks and plateauing of cases"". ""Although these more serious cases may increase, in the event of a further peak or plateauing of cases, any anticipated rises are within the capacity of the WA health system to manage,"" he said. Ms Sanderson said no new modelling had been requested to take account of the changed rules, but authorities were constantly assessing data. ""We're confident that the modelling we've got was right for the time,"" she said. ""Modelling is not the be all and end all. You can't base every decision on the modelling alone, it's an indicator."" Dr Robertson stopped short at the time of putting a number on how cases and hospitalisations would increase, noting hospital admissions had been well below previous estimates. Confirmed cases so far: 660,064 Active cases: 87,103 Cases in hospital: 323 Deaths: 216 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 81.3 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department In part, that could be because the virus was spreading mostly through young people. According to the latest WA Health data, about half of all cases between 18 and 24 April were in people aged under 30. But over time, that is expected to change, with the virus moving through older populations and potentially leading to more people becoming seriously ill with the virus. It is unclear what impact this will all have on deaths, which are higher than the government's modelling. Since the start of the year 140 West Australians have died with the virus, potentially exceeding predictions of between 89 and 171 deaths over an unspecified six-month period. The latest figures saw the state’s South West region record its second highest daily case number at 667, just shy of the record 678 posted on Saturday. Cases have been climbing in the tourist region after back-to-back long weekends, and the Margaret River Pro surfing event that finishes up today. Ms Sanderson said the climbing numbers had not come as a surprise. ""The vast majority of people with COVID will cope at home, they will just stay at home, isolate, maybe call for some support or help if they need it,"" she said. ""But really, they're not needing to go to hospital, so we think the system is coping, people are coping, and those numbers are anticipated."" Today's peak should stand as a warning that COVID is not over, according to the head of the Australian Medical Association in WA. He said the key figure to watch over coming days would be the number of people in hospital with the virus, given the state's health system is already stretched thin. ""If the hospitalisation rate started to get into the 300s, 350 cases, then that's going to put a significant extra load on the hospital system,"" he said. ""Remember, the hospital system isn't running at 100 per cent, there's staff shortages, there's staff sickness, and the ability of the system to respond is compromised."" Dr Duncan-Smith said if the state were to reach that mark, the government should look at reintroducing restrictions, particularly indoor mask wearing to avoid the medical system getting ""smashed"". But the number of new cases remained an important metric, he said. ""The new caseload number will lead to increased hospitalisations a week or two later, so the two factors do need to be kept an eye on,"" Dr Duncan-Smith said. Meanwhile, it has been announced direct flights between Perth and London will resume from May 23, with tickets available from today. The return of the direct flight route was originally scheduled for June, after the service was shelved due to COVID-19. Tourism Minister Roger Cook said the flights, along with a Perth-to-Rome route scheduled to start in June, would provide a significant boost to tourism in WA. ""The United Kingdom is a key visitor market for WA and the early return of the Perth-London route marks a great day for tourism,"" he said. ""The two direct connections from Perth to London and Rome will provide a huge boost in the number of visitors coming to WA from Europe."" The state government says international leisure arrivals from Europe had increased by 2.8 per cent in 2019, just before the pandemic hit.

218,One argument in the leaked Supreme Court document initially went unnoticed. It could change America forever,health,"  The Supreme Court leak has some Americans worried that abortion rights are just the beginning. Here's what could come next After half a century, a right many Americans believed was assured looks set to be reversed. And others could follow. A leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court, published by Politico, shows justices are poised to defy precedent and public opinion to overturn the landmark 1973 decision enshrining access to abortion: Roe v Wade. If a post-Roe America becomes a reality, as many believe it will, the right to privacy implied by the ruling will likely go with it. That would pave the way for other important protections to potentially be wound back. The right to access contraception, for example, or the right to marry someone of the same sex or a different race may also become vulnerable. President Joe Biden was careful to use caveats when he labelled the draft opinion, which could still be softened or abandoned, a ""radical decision"". ""The idea that concerns me a great deal is that we're going to, after 50 years, decide a woman does not have a right to choose within the limits of the Supreme Court decision,"" he told reporters. ""But even more equally as profound is the rationale used. And it would mean that every other decision relating to the notion of privacy is thrown into question."" The 98-page leaked document, written by Justice Samuel Alito, is an unequivocal rebuke of Roe v Wade and its 1992 successor Planned Parenthood v Casey. Opponents of abortion access have celebrated the possibility of a post-Roe America. But for those who support access to the procedure, it echoes a frightening era of underground abortion networks and botched backyard surgeries. And for others, it foreshadows a future where millions of people's lives are altered by a conservative super-majority on the highest court in the land. It is not unusual for the first draft of a Supreme Court decision to go through several rounds of editing before being made public. But Justice Alito's wording throughout the sprawling text is unusually aggressive. His writing is peppered with attacks on the reasoning of his 1970s predecessors, labelling their decision ""egregiously wrong"" and their arguments ""exceptionally weak"". It is, however, narrowly focused on reproductive rights. ""Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion,"" he writes. But several legal scholars say that despite Justice Alito's qualifications, his reasoning could easily be applied to a range of other hard-won rights. Roe v Wade is built on an implied constitutional right to privacy. Justice Alito's draft seems to argue for a more literal and less liberal interpretation. He says if a right is not spelled out in black and white, such as the right to bear arms or freedom of the press, then it is only implied when ""deeply rooted in this nation's history and tradition"". He also says abortion doesn't meet that standard because it was ""entirely unknown in American law"" until the latter part of the 20th century. Neither do multiple other ""implied"" rights: The privacy to access contraception, or to have sex with or marry whoever you chose, no matter what race or gender they might be. According to Justice Alito, abortion rights fundamentally differ from other previous rulings that involve ""intimate sexual relations, contraception and marriage"". But given his proposed judgement shreds the logic those decisions were based on, it's likely that concept will be tested in court in the future. The source of America's right to privacy comes from a rule that bans the US government from quartering soldiers in private houses without the consent of the home owner. Legal scholars have argued that America's founding document recognises that every citizen is entitled to a life that is beyond the reach of the government. The Supreme Court has slowly extended the concept of what basic rights fall under this umbrella for decades. Up until 1965, local laws could stop people from accessing contraception. Then the court quashed a law prohibiting contraceptive drugs and devices, in part because it determined citizens had a ""right to privacy"". Until the late 1960s, in some parts of America, members of different races couldn't get married. It was only after the court struck down a law in Virginia banning ""inter-breeding"" that this freedom was ensured. Gay sex remained illegal in some places until 2003 when the court found Texas sodomy laws to be unconstitutional. Then, in 2015, a landmark case saw same-sex marriage legalised in all 50 states. At the heart of that decision? The right to personal privacy. If Justice Alito's vision — and that of his conservative colleagues Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — comes to pass in June or July, the most pressing threat, is to abortion access. At least 13 states have ""trigger laws"" in place, which will effectively ban abortions as soon as Roe v Wade falls. At least another 10 are expected to ban or further restrict access. But legal scholars are watching what action is taken next, particularly in Republican states such as Florida and Texas, which are currently engaging in hostile legislative actions towards the LGBTI+ community. Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, says it's unclear exactly how soon these previous decisions could be tested. ""It would be mind-boggling if the Supreme Court actually went down that path on contraception, but it might on same-sex marriage,"" he said. ""I don't think same-sex marriage is as safe and entrenched … as the right to contraception."" There aren't any current cases before the Supreme Court asking it to reconsider the same-sex marriage decision. But if one were brought, outdated state laws, which were abandoned in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling, could also prove thorny. Florida still has a law banning same-sex marriage that could be resurrected if the current Supreme Court ruling fell. Like same-sex marriage, a clear majority of Americans want abortion to be legal — as many as 70 per cent, according to a recent Gallup poll. But the Supreme Court is unlikely to be swayed by public opinion, leaving Democrats and pro-choice advocates with limited pathways forward. Some Democrats, including congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and senator Bernie Sanders, are calling for President Joe Biden to go around the Supreme Court. Theoretically, a federal law could be passed through Congress that protects abortion access. But with a razor-thin majority in the Senate, such a move would be extremely difficult for Democrats. Pressed by reporters on whether he would attempt it, Mr Biden agreed codifying Roe v Wade into law made sense. But he stopped short of threatening the filibuster — the archaic procedural mechanism that's stopping Democrats from leaning on their slight majority to pass laws in the Senate. ""I'm not prepared to make those judgements now,"" he said.

220,Biden blasts 'radical' US Supreme Court draft opinion on Roe v Wade abortion rights,health,"  US Supreme Court to investigate Roe v Wade draft opinion leak, confirms its authenticity US President Joe Biden has blasted a ""radical"" Supreme Court draft opinion that would throw out the landmark Roe v Wade abortion rights ruling that has stood for a half century. Across the United States, Americans grappled with what might come next as the Democratic-controlled Congress and White House both vowed to try to blunt the impact of such a ruling. But their prospects looked dim. The court confirmed the authenticity of the leaked draft, which was dated to February, and Chief Justice John Roberts said he had ordered an investigation into what he called an ""egregious breach of trust"". A court statement emphasised that the draft is not the justices' final word. Opinions often change in ways big and small in the drafting process, and a final ruling has not been expected until the end of the court's term in late June or early July. A decision to overrule Roe would have sweeping ramifications, leading to abortion bans in roughly half the states, sparking new efforts in Democratic-leaning states to protect access to abortion, and potentially reshaping the contours of this year's hotly contested midterm elections. For almost 50 years, Dr Warren Hern has performed abortions in Colorado, a liberal safe haven for the women of Texas and other conservative states. The draft was published by the news outlet Politico on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One, Mr Biden said he hoped the draft wouldn't be finalised by justices, contending it reflects a ""fundamental shift in American jurisprudence"" that threatens ""other basic rights"" like access to birth control and marriage. ""If this decision holds, it's really quite a radical decision,"" he added. ""If the court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation's elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman's right to choose. ""And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November. At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law."" Though past efforts have failed, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he intended to hold a vote. ""This is as urgent and real as it gets,"" Mr Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday. ""Every American is going to see on which side every senator stands."" Leaders in New York and California rolled out the welcome mat to their states for women seeking abortions, and other Democratic states moved to protect access to abortion in their laws. The court's ruling would be most acutely felt by women who don't have the means or ability to travel from states that have or stand poised to pass stiff abortion restrictions or outright bans Whatever the outcome, the Politico report represented an extremely rare breach of the court's secretive deliberation process, and on a case of surpassing importance. ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,"" the draft opinion states. It was signed by Justice Samuel Alito, a member of the court's 6-3 conservative majority who was appointed by former President George W Bush. The document was labelled a ""1st Draft"" of the ""Opinion of the Court"" in a case challenging Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks. The draft opinion in effect states there is no constitutional right to abortion services. It would allow individual states to more heavily regulate or outright ban the procedure. ""We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,"" it states, referencing the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v Casey that affirmed Roe's finding of a constitutional right to abortion services but allowed states to place some constraints on the practice. ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives."" The draft opinion strongly suggests that when the justices met in private shortly after arguments in the case on December 1, at least five — all the conservatives except perhaps Chief Justice John Roberts — voted to overrule Roe and Casey, and Justice Alito was assigned the task of writing the court's majority opinion. Votes and opinions in a case aren't final until a decision is announced or, in a change wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, posted on the court's website. Politico said only that it received ""a copy of the draft opinion from a person familiar with the court's proceedings in the Mississippi case along with other details supporting the authenticity of the document"". The report comes amid a legislative push to restrict abortion in several Republican-led states — Oklahoma being the most recent — even before the court issues its decision. Critics of those measures have said low-income and minority women will disproportionately bear the burden of the new restrictions. The leak jump-started the intense political reverberations that the high court's ultimate decision was expected to have in the midterm election year. Already, politicians on both sides of the aisle were seizing on the report to fundraise and energise their supporters on both sides of the issue. The first Women's March of the Biden administration rallies outside the US Supreme Court in Washington DC. Democrats contended that several conservative justices misled senators about their feelings. Maine Republican Susan Collins, who supports abortion rights but was a pivotal GOP vote for the confirmations of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, said if the draft reflects the final opinion of the court, ""it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office"". Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told reporters on Capitol Hill that ""my confidence in the court has been rocked,"" and said her proposal with Senator Collins to legislate abortion rights should be reinvigorated. Polling shows relatively few Americans want to see Roe overturned. In 2020, AP VoteCast found that 69 per cent of voters in the presidential election said the Supreme Court should leave the Roe v Wade decision as is; just 29 per cent said the court should overturn the decision. In general, AP-NORC polling finds a majority of the public favours abortion being legal in most or all cases. Still, when asked about abortion policy generally, Americans have nuanced attitudes on the issue, and many don't think that abortion should be possible after the first trimester or that women should be able to obtain a legal abortion for any reason. Justice Alito, in the draft, said the court can't predict how the public might react and shouldn't try. ""We cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public's reaction to our work,"" Justice Alito wrote in the draft opinion, according to Politico. Outside, the Supreme Court building, anti-abortion rights protesters carried signs that said ""Ignore Roe"" and ""In God We Trust"" while their pro-abortion-rights counterparts held placards declaring ""Bans off our Bodies"" and ""Impeach Kavanaugh. Crowds were expected to build as the day wore on. Outside Washington, the reaction among conservatives was muted, ranging from cautious celebration over the anticipated ruling to sharp criticism of the source of the leaked draft. ""We will let the Supreme Court speak for itself and wait for the court's official opinion,"" Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch said in a statement. At Supreme Court arguments in December, all six conservative justices signalled that they would uphold the Mississippi law, and five asked questions that suggested that overruling Roe and Casey was a possibility. This week could be just the beginning for those who seek to oppose Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that legalised abortion in the United States. Only Roberts seemed prepared to take the smaller step of upholding the 15-week ban, though that, too, would be a significant weakening of abortion rights. Until now, the court has allowed states to regulate but not ban abortion before the point of viability, around 24 weeks. Twenty-six states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned, according to the pro-abortion rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute. Of those, 22 states already have total or near-total bans on the books that are currently blocked by Roe, aside from Texas. The Texas law banning it after six weeks has been allowed to go into effect by the Supreme Court due to its unusual civil enforcement structure. Four more states are considered likely to quickly pass bans if Roe is overturned. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have protected access to abortion in state law. The Supreme Court justices generally spend May and June finishing their writing in cases that have been argued and then issuing the remaining opinions before going on a summer break. On the court's calendar, the next day opinions might normally be expected is May 16.

221,Who are the winners and losers in Victoria's 2022 budget?,health,"  Victorian budget 2022: Winners and losers Victoria's election-year budget contains big spending pledges for the state's under-strain health system, as well as more funding for education, infrastructure and police. The funding comes with a price tag that will impact taxpayers for some years into the future. Victoria’s health system, which has been under the pump for years, is the major winner out of this budget, with $12 billion of spending. The government's funding 400 more triple-0 call centre workers for the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA), at a tune of $333 million. Another $124 million is allocated for Ambulance Victoria to recruit 90 more paramedics. The budget includes a $1.5 billion plan announced in early April to tackle the state's ballooning elective surgery waiting list. It's also put down $900 million to build the Melton Hospital in Melbourne's booming west and $500 million to expand the Barwon Women's and Children's Hospital. A further $236 million will be spent on expanding emergency departments at Werribee Mercy Hospital in Melbourne's west and Casey Hospital in the east. And the pandemic's not over, with $4.2 billion set aside for rapid antigen tests and other COVID-19 measures. Another $1.3 billion will be spent to implement the recommendations of the state's mental health royal commission. That includes $218 million for new mental health beds, $372 to train 1,500 more mental health workers, including 400 mental health nurses. The state's net debt is projected to keep rising. It is expected to sit at $101.9 billion at the end of this financial year, which would account for 19.8 per cent of the state's entire economy. It is expected to keep growing across the forward estimates, growing to $118.5 billion next financial year and an eye-watering $167.5 billion in 2025-26 – 26.5 per cent of the state's economy. While net debt rises, the state's operating deficit is forecast to contract over the forward estimates. The deficit is projected to shrink to $7.9 billion in 2022-23, $3.3 billion then $1.1 billion before building to an operating surplus of $650 million by midway through 2026. There is a similarly optimistic outlook for building to a cash surplus. The state is projected to end the current financial year with a $11.8 billion cash deficit, but the government is planning to build to a cash surplus of $1.3 billion the next financial year, rising to $5.5 billion in 2025-26. The state's education sector is also a winner this year, with $1.8 billion set aside to help build 13 new schools and finish upgrading every government special school in the state. There's also money to bring in 1,900 new teachers. And there's a bump in funding for kindergartens, with $131 million put aside.But the Australian Education Union says the government has ""missed the mark"" with TAFE funding — wanting more than the $83 million currently put aside to help the skills trainer move to a new funding model and help students find places. The government is continuing with its cornerstone transport infrastructure builds. A total of $3.5 billion will be spent on transport projects. That includes $338 million for more train services, level crossing removals and Big Build initiatives. There will be more trains to the regions, with $250 million allocated for 12 more V/Line trains on the Shepparton and Warrnambool lines. Free 30-day public transport travel passes will be made available to students experiencing crisis. Nearly $1 billion — $993 million — will be spent on road upgrades. That includes investing $101 million in regional roads, which will include intersection upgrades, overtaking lanes, and new roundabouts on key highways across regional Victoria. But the budget has outlined a $5.8 billion blowout on the cost of the state capital works projects, which includes those transport infrastructure builds. As we've outlined, the budget contains millions upon millions of dollars to recruit new workers in public sector roles. But the wages of those public service workers are currently capped at 1.5 per cent. That's less than the current national inflation rate of more than 5 per cent, and also less than the projected inflation rate for Victoria, which is expected to hover around 3 per cent in the forward estimates. So in effect, it's a wages cut. But the Treasurer did flag that might be up for review. And the government is pressing on with about $1.7 billion worth of savings it had flagged in previous budgets. Forecast growth in the economy is underpinned by a number of assumptions. One of those is that net migration into the state, both from overseas and interstate, will pick up by 1.2 per cent in the coming financial year. That is a modest increase in comparison to pre-pandemic levels, but will be welcome news after two years of COVID restrictions actually saw the population shrink in recent years. One of the election-year sweeteners was announced the day before the budget. From July 1, households will be eligible for a $250 rebate by simply visiting the state's free Energy Compare website. Consumers don't need to change providers, but the government wants you to compare your current rate in the hopes it'll save you case. The scheme is expected to cost the state $250 million while it runs. The Commonwealth Games is another huge beneficiary, with $2.6 billion allocated between now and the games to develop infrastructure for the event. The government had previously announced the games would be hosted across regional Victoria with Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong, and Gippsland to be hubs. Those regional centres that will see much of the benefit of new sporting infrastructure being built for the Games. And anyone thinking of selling a property soon might not like to hear the budget is predicting a 4 per cent drop in property prices over 2023. The drop is expected to hit high-value parts of the market hardest, before prices recover in the years beyond that. The state budget provides funding to continue Victoria's journey towards treaties, including the Yoorrook Justice Commission. It allocates funds to create healing centres recommended by the state's mental health royal commission. But the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service has accused the government of leaving it ""dangerously underfunded"" as it did not allocate funds to support the service's office expansion across regional and rural areas.

222,Call for Nicola Spurrier to return to SA vaccine mandate trial that may not proceed to judgement,health,"  Lawyers for nurses challenging South Australia's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers want to again subpoena the state's Chief Public Health Officer, despite the court hearing the case may never ""proceed to final judgement"" if the emergency declaration is revoked. Nurse and AFLW player Deni Varnhagen and another nurse – who lost their jobs because of the vaccine mandate – are seeking judicial review of the state government's decision to extend the state of emergency which has kept the vaccine mandate in place for healthcare workers. Their lawyers have previously argued that Police Commissioner Grant Stevens acted in excess of his power by mandating vaccines under the Emergency Management Act, which he administers as the state coordinator. But today, counsel for the state government told the Supreme Court the case should not proceed if the state's emergency declaration was revoked. ""If either the relevant direction is revoked or the declaration is either revoked or expires and is not renewed, it is futile for the court to go on to resolve the question of the validity of the direction,"" Mike Wait SC told the court. ""Therefore, there are real questions as to the likely prospect that this matter would ever proceed to final judgement. ""As I understand public statements that have been made, it is proposed that there will not be an extension of the direction beyond June."" Premier Peter Malinauskas wants it revoked by June 30. But Ms Varnhagen's lawyer, Paul d'Assumpcao, told the court a decision on the validity of the vaccine mandate should proceed. ""A respondent to the judicial review proceeding is entitled to proceed on the assumption that the decision has legal force and effect until the court declares otherwise,"" he told the court. ""It would not prevent the court from ruling on the application because, if the court allows the substantive application, that would give rise to a whole range of proceedings that my clients could institute because decisions that were previously assumed to have legal force and effect have now been declared by a court not to have that force."" He said his clients could then commence proceedings for ""recovery of wages and damages associated with the unlawful administrative action"". ""There's a very important tipping point, we say, upon the court agreeing with our application,"" Mr d'Assumpcao told the court. Mr d'Assumpcao also called for Justice Judy Hughes to reconsider her ruling sparing Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier from giving evidence. He made an application for a fresh subpoena to be issued for Professor Spurrier to be cross-examined as she worked closely with Commissioner Stevens in managing the state's pandemic response. Professor Spurrier was mobbed by a group of anti-vaccine mandate protesters as she left that hearing. Justice Hughes previously ruled there was no relevant evidence she could give but reserved her reasons for the decision to a later date. ""The quirk in this case is that if there's a conversation that hasn't otherwise been produced in writing then the only viable means by which we can present that information to the court is from the person who made – who spoke – in this case, that from our perspective most of that is Professor Spurrier,"" Mr d'Assumpcao told the court. ""And it would otherwise be hearsay. ""Whilst the state coordinator can attest to the matters that Professor Spurrier said, he can't attest to the truth of the assertion and that is the matter which must come from Professor Spurrier's mouth."" But Justice Hughes said ""it did not matter what Professor Spurrier told the state coordinator"" and that what mattered was what Commissioner Stevens ""understood"" and ""considered appropriate"" to make his decision. Justice Hughes will make a decision on the application at a later date. The matter returns to court later this month.

223,The abortion 'earthquake' rattling America after a secret court document was reportedly leaked,health,"  Roe v Wade: The US Supreme Court's draft ruling on the future of abortion rights appears to have leaked A leaked document suggests the US Supreme Court could soon vote to overturn a landmark ruling that grants Americans the constitutional right to an abortion. America's highest court is set to make a decision by the end of June on Mississippi's attempt to ban most terminations after 15 weeks of pregnancy. But in a move that is unprecedented in the Supreme Court's modern history, a secret draft ruling written by one of the judges was leaked to a US media outlet. The document, published by Politico, suggests five of the nine judges on the bench privately voted to strike down a 49-year-old decision that makes abortion legal at a national level. So what does this mean for America? Here's everything we know. The right to get an abortion in the United States comes from a landmark court decision made in the 1970s. A Texan mother who went by the pseudonym ""Jane Roe"" sued for her right to terminate a pregnancy in 1970. After years of legal challenges and appeals supported by the US women's rights movement, her case was eventually heard by the Supreme Court. The judges ruled by a 7-2 majority in 1973 that the Texas law was unconstitutional. They said that while America's constitution made no mention of abortion, the right to privacy was implied and that should extend to a person's reproductive decisions. For half a century, that court ruling has prevented all 50 states from banning abortion access outright. But the ruling did leave some wiggle room for states. ""We ... conclude that the right of personal privacy includes the abortion decision, but that this right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation,"" Justice Harry A Blackmun wrote. This qualification to his ruling means that abortion access in the US now varies from state to state. California, for example, is a politically progressive state that claims to offer the easiest access to the procedure in the United States. But Texas, a politically conservative state, prohibits terminations more than six weeks into a pregnancy. This year, the US Supreme Court has been considering a case called Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organisation. The case is challenging a law that was passed in the US state of Mississippi in 2018, banning abortion after 15 weeks. Opponents say it violates the rights established by Roe v Wade, which does not cut off abortion access until a foetus becomes viable at 24 weeks. A decision is not expected to be announced before the court's current session ends in June. Supporters of abortion rights warned this case would be significant because conservative judges hold a 6-3 super-majority on the US Supreme Court. Judges with a more progressive view of US constitutional law used to hold a slim majority on the court, but when Donald Trump became president in 2017, he was able to hand-pick three new justices. Mr Trump was open about his hopes that the court would one day overturn Roe v Wade. ""That will happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court,"" he said in 2020. Politico says in February of this year, Justice Samuel Alito wrote a draft majority opinion on the Mississippi abortion case. In it, was a bombshell. ""Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,"" Justice Alito wrote. ""It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives."" Politico's editors insist its story went through an extensive review process and it believes the document to be authentic. SCOTUSblog, which closely monitors the court, also believes the draft is real. ""It's impossible to overstate the earthquake this will cause inside the Court, in terms of the destruction of trust among the Justices and staff,"" the site said. It's important to note that the document is a draft that reflects only the opinion of Justice Alito. Politico is reporting four other judges on the bench — Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — have voted in favour with him. But in the three months since the draft circulated around the court, some may have changed their minds or suggested amendments. The source of the leak is unknown. But giving the document to the media weeks before the decision was set to be made public may have been a last-ditch attempt to pressure some justices to switch sides. If some of the Justices change their minds by June, there is a chance Roe v Wade will survive. But if few or no amendments are made to Justice Alito's draft and it becomes the majority opinion, the effect on abortion access in the US will be swift and dramatic. More than 20 states already have laws or constitutional amendments in place for this very possibility. If Roe v Wade is overturned, some states have what is called a ""trigger ban"" in place so that abortion is immediately outlawed in almost every situation. Among them is Arkansas, which would have a near-total ban on abortions. Kentucky, Louisiana and South Carolina would ban terminations six weeks into a pregnancy. Supporters of abortion access say the procedure would only be accessible to those who could afford to travel to the states where it remains legal. They say those who cannot afford it would be forced to give birth or may even seek a dangerous, back-alley abortion. While support for abortion varies from state to state, national polling has consistently shown for several years that most Americans believe the procedure should be legal. A poll in late 2021 found that 59 per cent of American adults believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 39 per cent think it should be illegal in all or most cases. Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul responded to Politico's leak promising her state would always make the procedure available. ""This is an absolutely disgraceful attack on our fundamental right to choose, and we will fight it with everything we've got,"" she said. ""Let me be loud and clear: New York will always guarantee your right to abortion. You have our word."" Meanwhile, Republican Senator for Arkansas Tom Cotton welcomed the possibility of a post-Roe America. ""The Supreme Court … must get to the bottom of this leak immediately using every investigative tool necessary,"" he said. ""In the meantime, Roe was egregiously wrong from the beginning and I pray the court follows the constitution and allows the states to once again protect unborn life.""

224,"Victorian budget's big spend on health flanked by billions for education, transport projects",health,"  Victoria's election-year budget will pile on debt to fix the state's beleaguered health system and continue to pump money into education and transport infrastructure while it attempts to claw back a modest surplus in four years. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the cracks in the state's health system, with GP shortages, ballooning surgery wait times and deadly ambulance delays exacerbated by coronavirus surges. In a bid to cauterise the growing number of problems in the sector, the centrepiece of Treasurer Tim Pallas's eighth budget is a pandemic repair plan forecast to cost $12 billion over the next four years. With triple-0 caught in a deadly crisis, the government has allocated $333 million to recruit 400 new staff for the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA), which has been under scrutiny after at least a dozen people died waiting for ambulances. The budget also includes $4.2 billion for COVID-19 health support, including another $1.1 billion for rapid antigen tests, $698 million for healthcare in the home and $284 million for personal protective equipment. Another $124 million is allocated for Ambulance Victoria to recruit 90 more paramedics. A new 24/7 hospital will be built in politically sensitive Melton, in Melbourne's fast-growing outer west, which is expected to cost $900 million. There's also $500 million for an expansion of Geelong's women's and children's hospital. A further $236 million will be spent on expanding emergency departments at Werribee Mercy Hospital in Melbourne's west and Casey Hospital in the east. There is funding for up to 7,000 new healthcare workers for the new and existing facilities, including 5,000 more nurses. The big health spend includes the $1.5 billion announced in April to reduce the growing elective surgery waitlist. Another $1.3 billion will be spent to implement the recommendations of the state's mental health royal commission, a continuation of the centrepiece of last year's budget. Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said rather than being a pandemic repair plan, it was ""a PR repair plan for one Victorian: Daniel Andrews"". In total, the budget has allocated a total spend of $99 billion in the coming financial year. Over the next four years, $2.2 billion is allocated for ""funding not allocated to specific purposes"" – which in an election year, means the state can expect more cash splashed before the November vote. One of the election-year sweeteners was announced on Monday – a $250 rebate for energy bill payers if they use the state's electricity comparison website. In a typical Labor budget, education is another big winner, with $1.8 billion allocated for building 13 new schools and upgrading 65 existing education settings. To find more educators to work in those settings, $779 million is allocated to recruit 1,900 new teachers and $131 million is put aside for kindergarten services. But the Australian Education Union said the government had ""missed the mark"" with TAFE funding — wanting more than the $83 million currently put aside to help the skills trainer move to a new funding model and help students find places. See how the Victorian government prioritised spending in its election-year budget. And $3.5 billion in total will be spent on transport projects. That includes $338 million for more train services, level crossing removals and Big Build initiatives, $993 million for road upgrades, and $250 million for 12 more V/Line trains on the Shepparton and Warrnambool lines. But it has outlined a $5.8 billion blowout on the cost of the state capital works projects, which includes key transport infrastructure. The Opposition Leader said if it was not for those blowouts, the state would have been able to fund important health investments without going deeper into debt. ""What that means is there are consequences for Victorians, a mountainous level of debt, with interest rates rising, is going to have a really challenging effect on our economy and our way of life,"" Mr Guy said. The Commonwealth Games is another huge beneficiary, with $2.6 billion allocated between now and the games to develop infrastructure for the event. As expected, the state's regional hubs will benefit from the Games spend, with new sporting and transport infrastructure to roll out as part of the event. Victoria Police will get another $342 million for 502 new police officers and 50 public service officers. That's less than the 1,200 wanted by the union, but a significant boost to its ranks. As announced in March, casual workers will be able to access sick pay under a two-year trial estimated to cost about $245 million over that trial period. There's nothing in the budget for what will happen once those two years are up. Social and affordable housing is also getting some attention, with $1 billion being made available in low-interest loans to help community housing agencies build up to 6,000 more homes. To pay for the spending, the state's net debt is projected to keep rising. It is expected to sit at $101.9 billion at the end of this financial year, which would account for 19.8 per cent of the state's entire economy. It is an improvement on the $104.5 billion forecast in the budget update at the end of last year. But it is expected to keep growing across the forward estimates, growing to $118.5 billion next financial year and an eye-watering $167.5 billion in 2025-26 – 26.5 per cent of the state's economy.

Mr Pallas was keen to highlight progress on the first three fronts in Tuesday's announcement. The unemployment rate in the state is forecast to sit at a record-low 4 per cent in the next year, in line with the national average and making Victoria one of the best-performing states post-pandemic. However, that rate is expected to rise slightly to 4.25 per cent the following year, rising to 4.75 per cent by 2025-26. The budget projects the state will end this financial year in June with a jobs growth rate of 3 per cent, slowing to 1.75 per cent the following year and then picking up again to 1.25 per cent and 1.75 per cent the subsequent years. The Treasurer's optimistic outlook on economic and jobs growth has the state forecast to be operating with a modest surplus in the 2025-26 financial year, a surprise after what was a grim outlook in last year's budget update. Before the state gets there, an operating deficit of $17.6 billion is forecast for the upcoming financial year – $1.9 billion lower than forecast in the December budget update, but dramatically higher than the $11.6 billion projected in the budget last May, before rolling lockdowns and the deadly Omicron wave. It means Victoria spent $17.6 billion more than it made in revenue in the last year, and is expected to keep spending more than it makes for at least four more years. The deficit is projected to shrink to $7.9 billion in 2022-23, $3.3 billion then $1.1 billion before building to an operating surplus of $650 million by midway through 2026. There is a similarly optimistic outlook for building to a cash surplus. The state is projected to end the current financial year with a $11.8 billion cash deficit, but the government is planning to build to a cash surplus of $1.3 billion the next financial year, rising to $5.5 billion in 2025-26. The government is attributing that forecast rise to a projected government expenditure drop of 9.7 per cent in the upcoming year, largely due to ending pandemic support schemes. There are no new taxes or significant cuts to public services as part of the forward plans, but tax revenue through mechanisms like stamp duty is expected to rise. To claw the state back from its debt and deficit, the budget relies on a number of key assumptions at a time it acknowledges is full of heightened economic risk. ""Risks to Victoria's economic outlook remain greater than normal and the forecasts are subject to a higher degree of uncertainty,"" the budget says. It cites COVID-19, inflation and a backdrop of ""elevated geopolitical volatility"". It projects the inflation rate will reach 3 per cent on average this financial year, before easing to 2.5 per cent on average in 2022-23. That's well behind the real-world inflation rate of more than 5 per cent currently being experienced by Australians. On the COVID front, the budget papers admit ""future intermittent outbreaks are assumed to occur"", but says the economy will be sheltered by high vaccination rates and ""increased adaptation by consumers and businesses to outbreaks"". While the state's population has contracted, it is projected to pick up to 1.2 per cent by the middle of next year as net overseas and interstate migration recovers. It says the gradual return of international students will pump money into services exports. Melbourne is still forecast to become Australia's biggest city despite over 60,000 people leaving during the height of the pandemic — the biggest population drop of any capital city. Consumer spending is also expected to keep rising in the forward estimates. Mr Guy called some of the assumptions ""pure fantasy"". Economist David Hayward said some of the assumptions were ""a bit bold"", including the projected inflation rate, which is already out of date. He said the net debt was currently sustainable, as it was locked in at low interest rates and was being used to fund investments which would support the economy. ""For how long we can keep borrowing is another question,"" he cautioned. Public sector wages – one of the government's biggest costs – are expected to account for $37.5 billion of expenditure in 2022-23. That price tag relies on the assumption the wages bill will rise by 2.2 per cent. Public sector wages are currently capped at 1.5 per cent, well under the current inflation rate, and Mr Pallas indicated that may be up for review. Crown Casino is one of the few clear losers in the papers, with an increase on taxes on poker machines forecast to bring in another $30 million in revenue from 2023 onwards. On the other hand, the government will spend nearly $60 million to implement the recommendations from the royal commission into Crown's behaviour. There is expected to be a revenue increase through stamp duty, which is projected to rise to $10.2 billion. There is also a suggestion the state will gain back about $1.2 billion over three years from a settlement with the Cross Yarra Partnership Consortium, which is involved in the delayed and over-budget Metro Tunnel build. That is just a fraction of the total spending on the state's infrastructure projects. The budget also contains an announcement of the new Victorian Future Fund, projected to be worth about $10 billion over the medium term and initially funded by the VicRoads Modernisation Joint Venture – a part-privatisation of the motor vehicle service announced last year. Mr Pallas acknowledged he had been ""particularly cryptic"" in detail on the fund, because the state is currently involved in tender processes for initial contributions. Today's announcements come amid a tightly-fought federal election campaign where cost of living has been front and centre. Mr Pallas has not held back on criticism of the Commonwealth, in particular what he called ""inadequate infrastructure funding"" and GST revenue. ""Can I promise you, I'll stop banging on about it when we get a fair deal from the Commonwealth,"" Mr Pallas said as he addressed journalists in the budget lock-up.

225,"Children not yet told of parents' deaths in taxi crash in India, friend says",health,"  Children undergo surgery after car crash in India that claimed the lives of parents A friend of an Adelaide family involved in a fatal car crash in India says the two surviving children are recovering well from surgery but have not yet been told of the deaths of their parents. Hemambaradhar ""Hems"" Peddagamalla and his wife Rama Batthula were killed when their taxi crashed near Hyderabad on Wednesday, on their way to the funeral of Ms Batthula's father. Their children Bhavagna, 9, and Palvith, 6, were injured in the crash, and family friend Vijay Akkineni this morning told ABC Radio Adelaide that, medically, ""the kids are doing well"". But he said the emotional trauma was still to come. ""The little boy, the six-year-old — he had his surgery a few days back and he's recovering very well, and the girl, a nine-year-old, she went for surgery last night and the surgery went well and both the kids are in good spirits,"" Dr Akkineni said. ""The main issue is the kids are not aware of the death of their parents unfortunately, so that's one big thing – we need to break it to them. ""That's a very hard part on us, even we, as adults, are struggling to cope with that one … ""But we just wanted to make sure that the kids recover from their injuries before we can put them into a much more traumatic situation."" Mr Peddagamalla was a car salesman and Ms Batthula worked for the Department for Child Protection. ""It was such a happy family, everything was going so smoothly,"" Dr Akkineni said. He said the local community had been ""so supportive"" during a time of immense grief and was now focused on doing what it could to help the children while they remained in India. But he said one complication was the fact that the children now ""don't have any immediate family members here in Australia"". ""All their grandparents and extended family is back home in India,"" Dr Akkineni said. ""We'll look at the legal aspects and other immigration issues which are beyond my comprehension at this stage. ""That's the challenge and long path ahead of us, to try to give them the better future that their parents always would have wanted for them to have."" South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas said it was a tragic situation that had shocked ""us all to the core"". He said the Department of the Premier and Cabinet had contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) to try to expedite the children's return to Australia. ""The full resources of my department and its international engagement section with DFAT will do everything it possibly can,"" he said. ""And then of course the journey just begins for this family and these beautiful kids."" Mr Malinauskas said he hoped federal authorities, including DFAT, would ""use all the options the law provides for in these circumstances to see a compassionate response"". ""If that means providing visas for grandparents then I think [that] should be pursued assertively,"" he said. DFAT has been contacted for comment.

226,COVID variants detected in SA for first time as health chief warns of reduced flu immunity,health,"  South Australia's public health chief has issued a warning to parents about reduced flu immunity ahead of winter, as new COVID variants are detected in the state. SA Health said the latest genomic sequencing of positive PCR results had led to the first detections of the BA.4 and BA.5 COVID sub-variants in South Australia. Each case was in a returning international traveller. Both variants have already been detected interstate, after previously being identified in South Africa. ""At the moment we're just watching the epidemiology or the case numbers in South Africa,"" Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""There's no indication that these are more severe or more transmissible."" SA today reported 3,215 new cases of COVID-19 and three deaths — a woman in her 90s and two men in their 80s. There are 228 people in hospital with the virus, including 17 in intensive care. Professor Spurrier said one broader social side-effect of COVID had been a significant decline in flu cases in the past two years. But she said that South Australia's influenza caseload was now ""starting to really kick up"", with children under the age of two now facing their first full flu season. ""Particularly our youngest children — the babies — have not been exposed to any flu because we haven't had any over the last couple of years, with the borders shut,"" she said. ""Children younger than five cannot have the COVID vaccine but from six months and up they can have the flu vaccine. ""If you're thinking of vaccinating your children for COVID — and that's five years and above — please also think about having your child vaccinated for influenza this year."" Professor Spurrier said it was now possible to have flu and COVID shots administered at the same time, and said it would soon be possible to be tested for both concurrently. ""SA Pathology are all set to go to be able to do the duplex, so do flu and COVID on the same specimen, we're just waiting to be at the right time point to switch that on,"" she said. Meanwhile, the state government is planning to introduce amendments to the Public Health Act that would allow COVID-19 restrictions to be in force under that legislation rather than the Emergency Management Act. Premier Peter Malinauskas said the goal was to remove the state of emergency by June 30. It was originally put in place by the former Liberal government in March 2020. Mr Malinauskas said he had briefed Opposition Leader David Speirs on Labor's plans but he was unclear on the Liberals' position. ""The best course of action is for the bipartisan support that has existed for a long time on COVID to be maintained,"" Mr Malinauskas told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""If we do that — we get the legislation through — that puts the Police Commissioner in a position to be able to make the judgement he needs to to see the emergency declaration over by June 30."" Mr Speirs is isolating with COVID-19 and — along with several other Liberal MPs to have contracted the virus, the latest of whom is Tim Whetstone — will not be in parliament for the first day of sittings today. Professor Spurrier attributed anecdotal reports of intensified symptoms to changing public perceptions rather than the virus itself. ""I think people have probably underestimated how sick you get with COVID,"" she said. ""We've perhaps heard, 'well, Omicron is less severe' – it's less severe than Delta but Delta was pretty bad."" She said, while mask-wearing requirements have been generally relaxed, it was appropriate that they remained in place for high-risk settings. ""One area that cause some people some frustration is continuing to require masks on public transport and rideshares,"" she said. ""That's also because people who have those higher levels of susceptibility in terms of chronic health problems or disability or are older may not have their own car and that may be the only way they can get around in South Australia.""

228,"'People look at me and wonder what's going on': Olympic kayaker trains through pregnancy, big bump and all",health,"  Kayaker Alyce Wood's pregnancy a welcome bump on road to third Olympics Elite kayaker Alyce Wood is 32 weeks' pregnant and admits she's an unusual sight on Gold Coast canals where she trains. ""A lot of people look at me when I'm paddling and wonder what's going on,"" she said. ""The belly is definitely protruding over my legs now and it's a little bit harder to rotate and paddle properly, so it does look a bit odd. ""I am not ready to finish paddling just yet."" The 29-year-old represented Australia in sprint kayaking at the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Wood said her decision to continue paddling while pregnant surprised many who had assumed she would retire from the sport. ""That really kind of hurt me … so I've been quite vocal about what I'm doing and what my intentions are,"" she said. ""There's not a lot of research in the area, so we're kind of going in a little bit blind. ""We're taking things as they come, which is a little bit scary, but pretty exciting to try to set a precedent and pave the way for girls in the future."" The Australian Institute of Sport is conducting research into pregnant athletes and women's health. Wood's training data is being monitored by CQUniversity (CQU) senior lecturer Melanie Haymen, who is based in Rockhampton. ""What we know in the field is quite limited because pregnancy was seen as time for rest,"" she said. ""Twenty years ago we wouldn't have been able to fathom that we would have women exercising during pregnancy, let alone elite athletes. ""With Alyce, we are able to get a better understanding of what these women are actually capable of and what we might be able to do moving forward with elite athletes and recreational athletes during pregnancy."" Wood said it was not unusual for women in other countries to continue canoeing after becoming a mother. ""At the Tokyo Olympics, every podium had a least one mum on it,"" she said. ""In Australia, it's more unusual. The last person to fall pregnant, have a baby, and come back was my mother-in-law. ""My husband is now 28 so it's been a long time since it's happened in Australia."" Anna Wood won a bronze medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, two years after giving birth to her son Jordan Wood, who also represented Australia in kayaking. Paddle Australia women's sprint kayak coach Rene Olsen said it was only the second time he had coached a heavily pregnant athlete. ""There has been a lot of females, top athletes, who have gone through pregnancies and come back,"" he said. ""We have a very good plan of what we're trying to achieve and the things that Alyce is trying to achieve this year are different from the rest of the group. ""Alyce has been heavily involved in deciding her program and how it fits around her pregnancy."" Olsen said Wood's training regime would make her return to the sport easier once she delivers her baby. ""Alyce is listening to her body and making adjustments when she's feeling things differently,"" he said. ""It's about good planning, but being able to flex when you need to."" Wood said she was not sure when she would stop paddling. ""I'll paddle until I'm uncomfortable, but at the moment I'm 32 weeks pregnant and still comfortable in the boat,"" she said. ""Once the belly gets bigger you physically can't fit in the boat and once that happens I'll transition out into different cross training."" That will include gym work, swimming, and riding a stationary bike. Wood is due to give birth in June and her goal is to represent Australia at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

229,"After years of driving taxis, Paul developed a simple three-strike rule to deal with challenging passengers",health,"  The jobs where you're a shoulder to cry on, but mental health training is rare It's easy for Paul Brooks to tell if the passenger jumping into the back of his taxi is up for a chat. The veteran driver starts by offering different routes to get to the destination, which he says breaks the ice. ""That's when they tend to start getting a bit chatty,"" he says. Mr Brooks has been driving in Melbourne for about 27 years, almost always on the night shift. ""Once the sun goes down, and the closer you get to midnight and the alcohol's flowing, people tend to turn out a bit differently after a few beers,"" he says. Often, the journeys end in a funny story. There was the time a young couple were discussing chucking a sickie and skipping work the next day, when Mr Brooks realised he knew the woman's boss and told her ""you probably should go to work tomorrow"". If he had to put a figure on it, he'd say about 20 per cent of his passengers open up and share parts of their lives from the back seat. ""Sometimes when they get in, they say 'just drive, get me out of here',"" he says. ""That normally leads to a longer conversation."" He jokingly dubs this part of his work ""free therapy"". But the 50-year-old says there's a more confronting side to the job. He's one of the drivers registered to pick up people to remove them from domestic violence situations. ""And you'll take a single person or a mother with a couple of kids, and they'll try and get as much of their luggage and belongings in the boot, and you'll drive them from one side of town to the other, or somewhere else,"" he says. As someone who witnessed domestic violence as a child, it can sometimes hit close to home. He admits there have been times he's left a job, driven around the corner and shed a tear. Like most drivers, Mr Brooks has no formal training in mental health first aid, or how to deal with vicarious trauma. But he often finds himself on the frontline. On a recent job, he picked up a woman he believed was a mother. He says they stopped at a service station for her to buy a bottle of water and it then became clear she went to the bathroom to use drugs. ""You pick up fares like that, and I tend to think about it for the rest of the night,"" he says. As he talks, it's clear he often finds himself thinking about the barriers for people on the margins of society to access help. ""I don't know what the solution is,"" he says. The Commonwealth's Australian Institute of Health and Welfare suggests about one in five Australian adults has experienced a mental disorder in the past 12 months. The data indicates about half of Australians will experience a mental disorder over their lifetimes, with the institute noting ""a person does not need to meet the criteria for a mental illness or mental disorder to be negatively affected by their mental health"". Psychiatry professor Andrea Phelps is the deputy director of the Phoenix Australia Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health at the University of Melbourne. The centre speaks to a range of people for mental health training and research. Many are involved in traditionally frontline jobs like defence or have experienced natural disasters. Others work in industries where trauma may not be front of mind. Professor Phelps says often, those workers have never thought about the impact interacting with distressed, traumatised or abusive people at work was having on them. ""They've just accepted that there are difficult calls that they have to take sometimes, and that kind of thing,"" Professor Phelps says. But exposure to other people who are experiencing difficult situations can cause vicarious or second-hand trauma. ""We're not just talking about feeling empathy for someone, we're talking about people who actually then suffer themselves, as a result of having supported someone else,"" Professor Phelps says. ""And then that's obviously something that we need to try and avoid."" Get a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by subscribing to our monthly newsletter At the front desk at a busy bulk-billing medical clinic in Melbourne's northern suburbs, Mary McCloskey's job description is to take calls, sign in patients and help with office admin. But she says she has somehow ended up being ""a magnet for the more sensitive situations"", or for people seeking medical advice she is not legally allowed to give. ""And I suppose I'm a good listener, and don't like to hurry someone off the phone when all I can offer is to hear what they have to say, and just be an empathetic human being with them in the moment,"" she says. Those more personal conversations became more frequent during Melbourne's extended lockdowns — something Mr Brooks notes about the taxi industry too. The pandemic also saw an increase in abusive behaviour directed towards retail and hospitality staff, especially as mask and vaccine mandates came into effect. Ms McCloskey strongly remembers one conversation in particular, when Victoria introduced vaccine mandates last year. A man told her over the phone he would self harm if he was unable to get an exemption from a doctor. She kept talking to him, ""essentially just trying to keep him on the phone so that he could calm down with me, and feel heard"". ""By the end of the conversation he had calmed, he apologised for what he said and I told the doctor to call him as soon as he had a chance,"" she says. She says she and her fellow receptionists have received customer service training and got group advice from a counsellor. But she still summarises the impact on her mental health as ""brutal"" and would love to have more training. ""I'm not a security guard, but I'm playing the role of one. As well as a therapist and a help desk, and sometimes I'm even Google for people,"" she says. Professor Phelps says there are broadly three ways vicarious trauma can present — feelings of psychological distress or helplessness, intrusive thoughts and/or physical symptoms like tension and increased heart rates. Longer-term, people experiencing vicarious trauma can feel perpetually on edge, have disturbed sleep and begin to withdraw socially. Some people use drugs or alcohol to cope. For every death by suicide, more than 20 others attempt to end their life. Australia has a suicide problem — it seems we can all agree on that — but when it comes to solutions, the verdict isn't so clear. Ms McCloskey says she's experienced some of the physical and mental symptoms, especially during lockdowns when human contact outside of work was limited. Professor Phelps says in training programs run by the Phoenix centre, the focus is on supervision, managing workloads and training people to be aware of the signs of trauma. Strategies to connect with loved ones or other points of joy are another focus, she says. ""In the sorts of jobs that you're talking about where it's not actually part of the job description … the onus does tend to fall back on the individual,"" she says. Mr Brooks has developed his own strategies, including what he called the ""three d***head rule"" — if he has more than three difficult customers in a row, he will head home, even if he's only just begun his shift. But he says formal training would be invaluable. Training programs and awareness campaigns have emerged in a growing number over the past decade, including services which train hairdressers and beauty workers to spot domestic violence. Melbourne hair stylist Zowie Evans says salons are places where women often feel safe enough to disclose family violence. She is one of several hairdressers trained to recognise the signs and is urging other hairdressers to do the same. Workplaces and individuals can also access mental health first aid or psychological first aid training, which provides tools to respond to people experiencing mental ill-health. The first course was developed in Australia by Mental Health First Aid in 2000. Ziyad Serhan is the founder and chief executive of EducAID Au. The Sydney-based organisation works across a range of schools and workplaces but has a particular focus on culturally and linguistically diverse communities. ""Individuals might have good intentions and their hearts in the right place,"" he says. ""But if that's not paired with the correct skills, that can be quite detrimental when intervening to help somebody."" Mr Serhan, a former teacher, says all people should have a base-level training in mental health, and schools were a good place for that to start. ""Prevention is better than cure. But also early intervention is better than better than a crisis point being reached,"" he says. Late last year, the NSW government announced it would spend $130 million to train rural residents in mental health first aid. Other governments have funded similar, smaller programs for specific industries and demographics. Personal trainer Iona Harmony took it upon themselves to complete a mental health first aid course, trauma-informed care training and a number of other courses which they say inform their work. ""I think it's important to be trained in mental health regardless of what industry you work in,"" Ms Harmony says. ""We all have mental health and it's key that when you are dealing with clients, customers, employees, the public, that you understand what role — however big or small — you play in another person's wellbeing."" They say people often choose to share their burdens during exercise, as it's rare time they have ""away from work, family and stress, where they can let go and let it out"". It's often the same in the relative anonymity of a taxi ride. Paul Brooks has heard more about the lives of strangers than most, and thinks his colleagues could have a bigger role to play in providing help.

230,How soon after catching COVID-19 can you get it again?,health," Health In January, a 31-year-old woman in Spain tested positive for COVID-19 after developing a cough, fever, and feeling generally unwell. On the face of it, it sounds fairly unremarkable — except for one detail. The healthcare worker, who was fully vaccinated and boosted, had tested positive for COVID-19 just 20 days before. The woman's first infection was picked up via routine COVID-19 screening at her workplace. She didn't develop any symptoms, and isolated for 10 days before returning to work. But when she began feeling unwell a few weeks later, she tested again. This time, genome sequencing revealed she had contracted Omicron — after catching Delta in December. Scientists recently reported the case as the shortest-known interval between COVID-19 infections. ""People who have had COVID-19 cannot assume they are protected against reinfection, even if they have been fully vaccinated,"" said Dr Gemma Recio of the Institut Català de la Salut in Tarragona and one of the study's authors. While a 20-day gap between infections is particularly short — and likely unusual — COVID-19 reinfections are increasingly common. So, what are the odds of getting sick with COVID more than once? Health authorities typically define a reinfection as a case 90 days or more after a previous COVID infection, to exclude people who simply shed the virus for a long period of time. In Australia, a growing number of people have reported catching COVID-19 twice, but it's difficult to know exactly how common it is because publicly available data is limited. In Victoria, one of the few jurisdictions that has reported this data, almost 10,000 COVID-19 reinfections were recorded in the three months to March 2022. But overseas, in countries with previously high rates of infection, data shows COVID-19 reinfections have increased significantly since the arrival of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant in late 2021. In England, for example, more than 890,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 more than once, and most reinfections have occurred since December. ""If you go back to last year, [UK authorities] were estimating about 1 per cent of COVID cases were reinfections,"" said epidemiologist Hassan Vally of Deakin University. ""Now, they think that's up at around 10 per cent."" Many of these cases are likely to be people who were infected by the Alpha or Delta variants in 2021, and then infected again by the Omicron BA.1 subvariant or its even more transmissible cousin, BA.2. Most of us know someone who has managed to dodge catching COVID-19, despite being in a household with people who are sick. What makes some of us more resistant than others? The UK Office for National Statistics has also reported a significant jump in the rate of possible reinfections as part of its random sampling of households. In February, it estimated the rate of reinfections — which it only counts if four months have passed since a previous infection — had increased 15-fold following the arrival of Omicron in late December. ""That is potentially an underestimate too,"" Dr Vally said. ""You can clearly get reinfections that occur before that [120-day] time interval. ""And of course, you also get people who may not have had their first infection detected, so what we think is their first infection is actually a reinfection."" Similarly, in New York, the number of reinfections has increased dramatically since the arrival of Omicron, with roughly 220,000 reinfections being recorded — about 4 per cent of total cases. The good news is that reinfections are likely to be less severe than primary infections, given pre-existing immunity from prior infection and/or vaccination, said mathematical biologist Deborah Cromer. ""As a rule of thumb, you would expect that, especially if it was the same variant,"" said Dr Cromer of the Kirby Institute. Although people might still experience symptoms the second time around, Dr Vally said vaccination should prevent more serious consequences. ""We know that as time goes on, our immunity wanes in terms of its ability to protect us from being infected, but thankfully what is holding up is protection against severe disease."" In Australia, Dr Cromer said the rise in reinfections was partly because more people had now been infected with COVID-19, and therefore had the potential to get it again. ""Within Australia, this is the first time we would expect to see a whole lot of reinfection, because before December, we really didn't have huge numbers of infections,"" she said. ""Now is the time — from a purely statistical point of view — you'd expect to see a number of people have a second COVID-19 infection."" The Omicron variant is considerably more contagious than previous variants, she added, increasing the odds of infection across the board. That transmissibility, paired with waning immunity against infection and symptomatic disease, means we're potentially more vulnerable to a second hit. But it's also Omicron's unique mutations — which make it more apt at sneaking past our body's immune defences — that have caused reinfection rates to surge, Dr Vally said. This first became clear when the variant was identified in South Africa and researchers observed higher-than-expected rates of reinfection among people who had previously had COVID-19. ""Anytime you get a variant that has mutated in a way that allows it to evade the immune response … you're going to get more infections in people that are either vaccinated, or have had a previous infection,"" Dr Vally said. When it comes to a household COVID-19 outbreak, it can pay to be prepared. Here’s what you should have in your isolation survival kit. A recent study from Qatar suggests previous COVID-19 infection was roughly 90 per cent effective at preventing an infection with the Alpha, Beta or Delta variants, but only 56 per cent effective against Omicron. Imperial College London researchers estimate the risk of reinfection with Omicron is 5.4 times greater than with the Delta variant. ""If the virus changes sufficiently, then that immune response — from vaccination or previous infection — doesn't work as well,"" Dr Vally said. ""That antibody response that was very specifically targeted towards a virus … doesn't work so well on that new version."" While data suggests reinfection with Omicron is not uncommon in people who were previously infected with a different COVID-19 variant, it's less clear what protection one Omicron infection confers against another. This is a particularly important question in Australia, where most infections have been with Omicron, and new Omicron subvariants continue to arrive. ""It's definitely possible,"" Dr Cromer said. ""The immunity conferred from Omicron is not quite as high compared to previous variants. ""Especially in people who are not vaccinated, having had one infection with Omicron doesn't provide a huge amount of immunity against a second infection."" The next time you reach for a rapid antigen test, here are a few things to keep in mind. A small Danish study published in February — which is yet to be peer reviewed — found reinfection with Omicron BA.2 following BA.1 was possible, but happened rarely, and most reinfections occurred in unvaccinated people. Generally, it's thought the risk of catching the same variant twice is lower than the risk of catching a different one. However, the recent emergence of Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, which have caused another uptick in COVID-19 cases in South Africa, may increase the rate of second and third infections in coming months. A yet-to-be peer-reviewed study published late last week found BA.4 and BA.5 can reinfect people who caught Omicron BA.1, but that vaccinated people were much better protected than unvaccinated people. Dr Vally said ongoing surveillance was needed to better understand the risks. ""We're starting to get a picture, but there's a little way to go to really understand what's going on."" There's still a lot we don't understand about our immune response to COVID-19, but Dr Cromer says protection against reinfection essentially boils down to one thing: ""How much immunity you've got."" ""The factors that can influence that include how long it's been since your first infection — the longer it's been, the lower your antibody levels will be because they decrease over time,"" she said. ""The other factor that seems to impact [your risk] is how many vaccines you've had. ""Two vaccines doesn't provide a huge amount of immunity against getting infected with Omicron, but having a booster — that will boost your immune levels and make it less likely to get a reinfection."" Research suggests so-called ""hybrid immunity"" — a combination of prior infection plus two vaccinations and a booster — provides the strongest protection, which is why vaccination (including a booster) is still recommended if you've been infected. Being older or immunocompromised — and therefore less likely to produce a robust response to vaccination — can also increase your risk of reinfection, which is why both groups are now recommended to have additional booster doses. ""It all comes down to how many antibodies you've got left in your system when you next get exposed to the virus,"" Dr Cromer said. Dr Vally added it was important for Australians to remain up to date with their vaccinations, and to continue to take some precautions, even if they have had COVID. ""The message here is that being infected is not a get-out-jail-free card, meaning you're immune from any consequences from the SARS-CoV-2 virus,"" he said. ""Even if you've been infected, with so much COVID-19 circulating in the community, you're at a very high risk of being exposed, and you certainly have a risk of being infected. ""We all still have to live in a way where we try to minimise our risk … even though we are transitioning towards something looking like the way life used to be.""

231,Australians stuck in Shanghai's lockdown plead for help as they live in fear of a late-night knock at the door,health,"  Some Australians caught up in Shanghai's extreme five-week lockdown say the Australian government has done little to help its citizens in distress. China's largest city was put into an increasingly restrictive lockdown in March in an attempt to stamp out an outbreak of Omicron-fuelled COVID-19 cases. More than a month later, Shanghai authorities claim cases in the city are falling. But most of the 25 million residents are still either locked in their apartments, compounds or their workplace with no date announced for release. Those who are allowed out of their compounds are barred from travelling beyond their immediate neighbourhood. Authorities are also continuing to force COVID-positive residents from their homes and place them in crowded mass quarantine centres with poor conditions, as part of a political directive to get cases down to zero. Some Australians have been targeted with door knocks late at night from compound managers, health authorities and police in a bid to pressure them into voluntarily leaving home and ""camping"" at the centres. The Australian expats in the city who spoke to the ABC all say they are at breaking point. They are also questioning whether the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) could be more proactive about advocating for citizens forced from their homes or those seeking to leave the country. ""If I was arrested, I'd be getting better consular support than if I get thrown into one of these quarantine centres,"" said Nick Oettinger, an Australian businessman who has lived in Shanghai for 15 years. ""People are being dragged from their homes, there are unsanitary conditions, no one is speaking English and there's no consular access. ""Surely there must be a diplomatic protest from Canberra about this."" One Australian family with young children forced into a mass quarantine centre after testing positive for COVID-19 erected makeshift tents to seek some privacy from hundreds of other patients sharing the room. Another family with small children had to wage a two-week-long battle with their compound authorities to prevent them from being separated after multiple positive COVID tests in the household. Mr Oettinger points to French and British diplomatic letters written to China's Government in the early weeks of the lockdown requesting that parents and children not be separated in quarantine centres. While Australia was among 30 countries represented in France's letter, he believes the situation on the ground demands a greater response. Shanghai authorities may be loosening the city's COVID lockdown, but after weeks of uncertainty, foreign workers are considering leaving. ""I don't think anyone is asking the Australian government to ride in on a white horse and save us, but there are practical things they could do and I can't understand why they're not doing them,"" he said. Among them, he said, would be more help for Australians desperate to leave the city and return home. ""How hard would it be for the consulate to organise a charter flight?"" he asked. ""To pick up the phone to Qantas, to do the sums and talk to the Australian community in Shanghai with the figures of how much it would cost us each?"" When COVID-19 first emerged in China more than two years ago, the Australian Government was among dozens of countries that organised private charter flights to evacuate citizens trapped in Wuhan. Two and a half years later, commercial airfares are available. But hundreds of Australians are sharing information in WeChat groups titled Leaving May and Leaving June, as they try to secure scarce seats on limited flights out of the city. Adding to their anxiety are regular flight cancellations that have left some expats stranded at airports because compound security will not allow residents who leave to come back in. Angelina Rice is an Australian who will this week mark two months of lockdown with her husband and four-year-old son in Shanghai. ""We feel so alone here with the constant 'what if' questions about what backing or support you'd get if something happened,"" said Ms Rice said she turned to Australia's Shanghai consulate for advice and information in the chaotic early weeks of the lockdown on whether she could leave her compound for hospital treatment due to complications from a miscarriage. ""They offered no assistance in getting to the hospital or no reassurance or answers on what would happen to my family if I wasn't able to get back home,"" she said. She ultimately decided against going to the hospital. ""When you really need help from them, it seems staff at the Australian consulate's hands are tied,"" she said. ""They largely refer us to the DFAT Smart Traveller website or they tell you there's little they can do because you have to adhere to Chinese laws."" Like every Australian the ABC spoke to, Ms Rice is looking at leaving China due to the COVID-19 measures. But she said Australia's strict rules on importing pets was another practical snag complicating departures. While the US has loosened requirements for Americans fleeing Shanghai with pet dogs, Australia maintains a strict three- to six-month quarantine requirement in a third country that is seeing some pet owners charged up to $20,000 per dog. The American measure to ease rules is just one comparison Australians in Shanghai are drawing upon. Many believe the French have been more assertive in advocating for the rights of their citizens. ""The Australians gave some solid moral support on a call, but none match the French for response time and the intensity of community service,"" said another Australian whose family had dealt with multiple consulates after testing positive to the virus. The Australian diplomatic staff are not alone in feeling the frustrations of foreign nationals under lockdown. One British man this week posted a desperate plea on WeChat from the West Bund quarantine centre, asking friends: ""Call my embassy. They may do nothing but they need to understand that I am not just at breaking point, I am broken."" Another resident said expats at a recent meeting organised by the German consulate were ""basically expecting the consulate to force airlines to fly them out with their pets"". Messages seen by the ABC indicate that Australian consular staff are trying to help but are facing stiff resistance from a bureaucracy under extraordinary strain. In one case, an Australian official spoke to the neighbourhood committee of an Australian woman with special medical needs but was rebuffed in efforts to allow her to quarantine at home. The official then tried to contact a higher level of authority but could not speak to the relevant person in charge, vowing to follow up the next day. The ABC has contacted DFAT for comment. Natasha Kassam, a foreign policy specialist at the Lowy Institute and a former Beijing-based diplomat believes consulate officials are facing big challenges. ""While it's completely fair that expats would be looking for Australian assistance under these circumstances, there would be very real limits on the consular services that the Australian Government can provide,"" she said. ""In an emergency, with an opaque political system that is constantly changing advice, DFAT is quite constrained."" Ms Kassam said it was particularly difficult because the situation in Shanghai seems so fluid. ""It's unclear how Australian advocacy could lead to Australians receiving better treatment than most locals in Shanghai, though it's always worth trying,"" she said. ""But these Australian citizens also find themselves in an unenviable position where the bilateral relationship is so strained that Australian advocacy may have little effect in any case."" A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told the ABC the Australian Consulate-General in Shanghai ""continues to engage directly with local authorities on COVID-19 response measures, including in relation to the treatment of families and also to address welfare issues related to COVID restrictions"". In a statement, the department also said the Consulate-General had raised concerns about the separation of family members ""at senior levels with the Chinese government"", and is continuing to support the Australian community despite the ongoing challenges.

232,The former chair of a company that profited off the pandemic reveals how it got political 'access',health,"  The former chairman and co-founder of Aspen Medical has revealed how the company obtained access to senior ranks of the Coalition government by participating in political fundraising and appointing a former Liberal cabinet minister to its board. The company has earned $1.6 billion over the past two years, the bulk of which was courtesy of federal PPE contracts issued without a public tender. Its pre-tax profits during this period have totalled more than $420 million. Andrew Walker – who quit Aspen in 2019 and is now involved in litigation with the company's owner – has told Four Corners that former Liberal minister Michael Wooldridge introduced him to Greg Hunt, and arranged ""paid access"" to a budget dinner with the Health Minister. ""He did give access,"" Mr Walker said. ""It's paid access. You have a dinner with the minister, or lunch with the minister. I mean, it costs you money, they don't do it because they like to look at your face."" Mr Walker said he believed that Mr Hunt and Dr Wooldridge are close friends. ""I know Michael Wooldridge has introduced me to Greg Hunt, and he and Michael have arranged for me to go to Greg Hunt's office, which is very nice on a budget dinner,"" Mr Walker said. A Four Corners investigation has revealed Mr Hunt signed a glowing commendation for the company while it was in the midst of negotiations with his department over multimillion-dollar PPE deals. Dr Wooldridge served on Aspen Medical's board on and off until 2019. He remains a registered lobbyist for the company and is currently a director of Aspen's $1.3 billion Indonesian joint venture. He did not respond to questions from Four Corners. A spokesman for Mr Hunt told Four Corners, ""we are not aware of, nor have any record of, any lobbying by Dr Wooldridge on behalf of Aspen Medical in relation to any procurement"". He also said the commendation letter was ""written to support Aspen Medical in tendering for work in the United States and is appropriate for Australian firms assisting in international activity"". His statement said the PPE procurement was run by a taskforce of government officials at arm's length and that he had no role in assessing, recommending or negotiating for any of the National Medical Stockpile procurement deals. The spokesman said Mr Hunt recalls having met both Dr Wooldridge and Aspen at a budget function ""during the course of an evening where he would have met some hundreds of people"". ""We understand that Aspen has attended events with both major parties including with Shadow Minister Mark Butler,"" Mr Hunt's spokesman said. ""On budget nights the Minister will often visit over 10 functions and meet numerous people."" For the better part of two decades, Aspen Medical has provided outsourced health care across Australia and the world. It has deployed alongside the Australian Federal Police to the Solomon Islands, flown emergency medical teams to the Nauru immigration detention centre, and provided support to the Australian Defence Force overseas and at home. Before the coronavirus pandemic, however, the company's biggest earner had been a $170 million-a-year sub-contract with Medibank Health Services to provide an agreed number of medical staff for health clinics on more than 50 military bases around Australia. But its relations with Medibank and the Department of Defence turned acrimonious. Defence complained repeatedly about failures of Aspen to meet its contractual promises. ""It was a very rocky marriage from day one and it never improved,"" said Patrick Castles, a former Aspen Medical executive in charge of the contract, who now works for Andrew Walker's rival firm. ""[Defence] were claiming all sorts of breaches of the contract requirements, whether they be in credentialing, whether they be in key performance indicators or failure to do certain things or undertake certain things and complete them satisfactorily."" Defence was alarmed at how short-staffed some of its Aspen clinics were, and at the calibre of some of the people the company had recruited. It reported errors that ranged from dental work commencing on the wrong patient, to improperly administered medications and vaccines. Aspen was repeatedly forced to pay compensation under the contract worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Medibank told Aspen that a senior Defence official had warned them that if she was questioned about on-base health services during a parliamentary hearing, she was planning to ""dump shit all over Aspen"". Things never improved. In December 2014, for example, an internal Aspen Medical document reported the company had agreed to a $900,000 rebate ""to close out past issues"". One internal paper showed Aspen Medical attempted to go over the heads of both Medibank and the Defence Department, organising for ""papers detailing our position [to be] submitted to MINDEF [then-defence minister, Marise Payne]"". In April 2016, Aspen was advised by Medibank that by the end of that year, its contract would not be extended. ""The customer was not happy with the way we were going about our business,"" Andrew Walker said. In a statement, Aspen Medical said it ""could not accept the new contractual terms proposed by Medibank"". The company told Four Corners its contract involved 1,100 health professionals. ""It is inevitable that given these statistics, over the course of the contract term, there would be instances where some personnel and services would become temporarily unavailable e.g. due to illness, carer's leave etc.,"" it said. ""The contract recognised this potential and provided for Aspen Medical to provide service rebates for such unavailability."" In one incident on a NSW military base, Defence discovered Aspen was not properly checking its ""emergency trolley"", the medical resuscitation kit used in serious first-aid emergencies. Defence complained it had not been checked for 22 days, with Aspen's nursing staff failing to comply with daily and monthly checking protocols to ensure the equipment was replenished and ready to use. This very same failure occurred three years later at a privatised prison called Melaleuca in Perth where Aspen Medical had been hired to provide healthcare services – the incident is now the subject of an investigation by the state's coroner. In February 2017, an Aspen Medical nurse arrived at a cell with a resuscitation kit that had not been properly checked and replenished, to treat a woman who was in cardiac arrest. When attempts were made to use the oxygen, it was discovered the tank was empty, and an eight-minute delay ensued while the nurse ran back to get another. The 31-year-old woman, Cally Graham, later died, though a coronial inquest into her death has heard the delay in oxygen may not have been the cause of her death. One cardiologist, Dr Johan Janssen, told the Coroner's Court ""your resuscitation trolley should be checked every day"". ""It is not excusable to have an empty oxygen cell in a trolley,"" he said. The nurse involved, who no longer works for Aspen Medical, said there was meant to be a protocol followed by Aspen's staff for the equipment to be checked regularly, ""but obviously because of staff shortage … we don't know whether the process was followed"". She told the inquest the company's health care in the prison was disorganised. ""There was no system, nothing in place, no leadership,"" she said. Meanwhile, Aspen Medical's so-called ""comprehensive report"" filed after the incident, made no mention of the empty oxygen tank. In 2018, the state's custodial services inspector issued a public report that described the prisoners' experience of Aspen's health services as ""dire"". Four Corners has revealed the company knew from the outset that it was not meeting the requirements of its contract. A draft discussion paper prepared only weeks after the prison opened, and days after Cally Graham died, explicitly acknowledged ""inappropriate staffing levels"" were not meeting the requirements of the Corrective Services Department, the prime contractor Sodexo or Aspen Medical. As the pandemic raged, some companies quietly thrived on all the government spending. Today, Four Corners reporter Linton Besser on one company's billion-dollar COVID windfall. The paper reveals Aspen Medical had chosen to accept a contract that provided only $1.7 million a year to cover costs. Aspen had previously quoted about $3.2 million a year for the job. ""That led to a reduced staffing model being developed to meet the allocated budget but not the requirements of the scope of work,"" the document said. At the time, Aspen was providing a GP for only two four-hour sessions per week. The document reveals this presented a ""highly significant clinical risk"", including ""potential patient mismanagement/near miss catastrophe or death in custody due to lack of doctor cover from 9-5"". According to an internal document, the company decided to make cuts at the prison in 2018: ""Immediate actions implemented: freeze on overtime, roster realigned reducing nursing staff requirement, medical officer hours reduced, psych services reduced."" The reduction in mental health resources was apparent to Sally Oliver, a solicitor formerly with the Mental Health Law Centre. In October 2019, she wrote to the WA government to warn there was no treating psychiatrist on-site, and that the department risked breaching its duty of care to the inmates. Ms Oliver told Four Corners when she learned of the lack of a treating psychiatrist: ""I felt an immediate panic, because that left those women in danger."" In a statement, Aspen Medical said it was unable to comment on matters concerning the death of Cally Graham because of the ongoing inquest, and it did not answer several other questions that concerned its wider performance at the prison. The company said its thoughts are with the deceased's family and friends. Watch the full Four Corners investigation into Aspen Medical on iview now.

233,'I want Jaimi's life to have mattered': An emotional Lisa Curry discusses her grief over daughter's death,health,"  Lisa Curry chokes back tears discussing the death of her daughter Jaimi during ABC News Breakfast interview Former Olympian Lisa Curry has fought back tears during an emotional interview while discussing her mental health after the death of her daughter, who lived with an eating disorder and alcohol addiction. Curry was discussing her new autobiography and Australian Story episode on ABC News Breakfast. Host Lisa Millar asked about Curry's recent losses, with the death of her first-born daughter Jaimi in 2020 and mother Pat earlier this year. ""I am reluctant to even touch on them because I know it is so raw for you … but the reason I want to talk about it is because mental health in this country and what you want to see come in the future is so important to you,"" Millar said. ""Why are people falling through the gaps?"" Curry said she struggles to comprehend why mental health remains a challenge to treat and manage. ""I just don't understand how we can be so brilliant at so many things in the world but we can't work this one out,"" she said. ""Obviously, there is different causes for different people at different times in their lives, and it is complex and it is difficult and it is this toxic beast — that is what I call it in the book — that takes over somebody's mind. Lisa Curry has always lived a life in the public eye — from babies and break-ups to plastic surgery and weddings, her milestones have played out in the pages of magazines. But there was one thing this determined former athlete could not change or control. ""If I had the answer, I would shout it to the world, but we don't have the answers yet and I struggle with that."" Millar then asked if there was ""happiness for Lisa Curry right now?"". ""Yes, there are days when I am good and there are days when I am not and there are days when I am a complete mess,"" Curry said. ""If my husband is not around me, I fall into a hole. ""If I have got something around me and something to do and stay busy, it is OK."" A visibly emotional Curry then struggled to speak as she described the difficulty of being out in public. ""But I am just doing what I can do, you know,"" she said through tears. ""I want to continue doing what I do to help other people, because that is what I have done my whole life."" Her husband, Mark Tabone, then came into frame to comfort her through her tears as she described the hardship of her recent losses. Curry said she has ""been really honest about Jaimi"" in her new book Lisa: 60 Years of Life, Love and Loss. ""I haven't told all the stories because the book would be double the size, but I want — like all my lessons, all my hardships, all my losses and all my fear — I want it to matter,"" Curry said. ""I want Jaimi's life to matter and it wasn't in vain, and I have already had a message yesterday from a lady who, because of Jaimi and her struggles and what happened, she has talked to her daughter who is struggling as well and they are on the road to recovery. ""She said 'I just want you to know that it has really helped my daughter to survive'."" The mother's story was something Curry said ""Jaimi would really love"" and ""some consolation"". ""Another reason why I have been so open is because Jaimi wanted to write her own book herself to help other people,"" Curry said. ""I hope I am doing her proud and I want what I have done and I want what has happened to us to matter and I want Jaimi's life to have mattered."" She said doing PR for the book launch was ""usually the fun part"" but she was already sick in the stomach and fighting back tears with the thought of the questions she would face. ""Now more than ever I need my hubby by my side, but when he can't be, I just have to stay strong,"" she said in an Instagram post accompanying snaps of her with Tabone.

234,Quarter of a billion dollars set aside under new plan to fix struggling WA health system,health,"  Ailing WA health system gets $252 million budget boost amid pressure on emergency departments The WA government has vowed to spend $252 million trying to address issues in the state's struggling health system, as the Health Minister took aim at the Commonwealth for the ""abject failure"" to manage some patients. Premier Mark McGowan said the funding, part of next week's budget, would help address many of the pressures hospitals were under, particularly in emergency departments. He continued to point to staff furlough, ""unprecedented"" demand and COVID-19 control measures as key reasons for those stresses. In recent weeks, the pressures on hospitals have been highlighted by two deaths while patients waited for care in Geraldton and Busselton. Ambulance ramping figures also continue to show the strain, having increased significantly since mid-2020. The funding announced today will be shared across 17 projects, including $74.1 million to help move long-stay patients out of hospitals. ""They are often waiting [for] aged care placements or placement with NDIS packages,"" Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said. ""This is an abject failure of those Commonwealth agencies."" She said that money would go towards 120 aged care beds to get patients out of hospital, and $5.8 million to help address barriers stopping people from leaving hospital. ""Not only does that free up beds, but importantly it provides a better quality of life for those patients who don't want to be in hospital, and don't need to be in hospital,"" she said. An additional $55.8 million commitment was made to put registered nurses in 15 metropolitan and regional emergency department waiting rooms 24/7. That was a recommendation made in the wake of the death of seven-year-old Aishwarya Aswath at Perth Children's Hospital last year. Last month, two nurses told the ABC a similar position at Royal Perth Hospital (RPH) was often left unstaffed. At the time, an RPH spokeswoman said while that nurse was ""briefly"" moved to a COVID-19 triage tent, it had subsequently been expanded to both the main waiting room and the tent. Many of the other measures announced today were targeted at reducing the number of people presenting to emergency departments for treatment. That includes a $55.2 million boost to telehealth, with much of that money going to continuing a COVID-19 home monitoring program. More than $10 million will go to video and phone support for children and families transitioning between services, and $5 million has been set aside for telehealth mental health support in the regions. A ""virtual triage"" system will also be expanded beyond its initial trial at Fiona Stanley Hospital. Ms Sanderson said in a year it had diverted 1,000 patients heading to the hospital's ED via ambulance to either a ward or another service. But she was quick to temper expectations, explaining the changes would take some time to filter through. ""Addressing the root cause of the challenges facing our emergency departments will take time, but the first stage of this will be implemented as part of this budget,"" Ms Sanderson said. ""We don't expect great improvement in the coming months, given we're still in very high case load numbers of COVID and we are coming into our winter season which traditionally sees higher numbers of ramping."" WA takes a giant step towards living with COVID-19, as a whole raft of restrictions are removed. But she said with commitments already made to increase the number of beds and staff in the system, this was the next stage in addressing issues in hospitals. ""One part of it is resourcing the systems, but another part is just having good systems,"" she said. ""What I want to see as minister is a coordinated system that's working together to make sure we can divert patients to the most appropriate care."" The implementation of the changes will be overseen by a ministerial taskforce, led by Ms Sanderson. ""The taskforce will identify sustainable and enduring policies to relieve some of that pressure on emergency departments,"" she said. ""In the meantime, we will implement stage one of the reforms."" Ms Sanderson said the taskforce would include the leaders of North, South and East Metropolitan Health Services, as well as other stakeholders. A business case will also be developed for a centralised state health operations centre, with the capacity to oversee the entire state's health system and manage resources. The extra money has been welcomed by Australian Medical Association WA president Mark Duncan-Smith, but he said it would not address the core underlying issue. ""The lack of beds is the primary cause of ramping, and we're not seeing a huge amount in this plan that will increase capacity,"" he said. But Dr Duncan-Smith was pleased to see Ms Sanderson chair the ministerial task force to try and address many of the issues. ""This is the first time that we're seeing that the government is taking responsibility for [the] problem of ramping,"" he said. ""At least it's a start and it's a move in the right direction."" Dr Duncan-Smith also refuted the Premier's comments that COVID was responsible for many of the pressures on the system. ""These problems existed long before COVID started,"" he said. ""This is something that's been brewing for half a decade."" St John Ambulance chief executive Michelle Fyfe said she was hopeful the new measures would help reduce ramping and get crews back on the road faster. ""We're looking forward to this package freeing up capacity in emergency departments, and therefore freeing up ambulances to be able to get back on the frontline,"" she said. Of the measures announced, the expansion of virtual triaging was the one Ms Fyfe was particularly keen to see. But Dr Duncan-Smith warned that in some instances it simply diverted patients away from the emergency department straight to wards. ""When a hospital is 100 per cent occupied you can't get patients out of the hospital or around the hospital,"" he said. ""The hospital's full, the emergency department can't get its patients out. ""And then the emergency department gets full and you have ramping."" Shadow health minister Libby Mettam echoed concerns from the AMA that the measures would fail to adequately address ambulance ramping. ""Another review. Another taskforce. And no clear commitment to address ramping, which is now out of control,"" she said. ""Today's announcement is a piecemeal approach without any clear commitment to address ambulance ramping in the short to mid term. ""It's putting patients' lives at risk."" The Premier also announced the government would give close contacts another 10 free rapid antigen tests. As part of last week's easing, close contacts without symptoms no longer have to isolate as long as they comply with certain rules, including taking daily RATs. Mr McGowan said the free tests would help people take advantage of that change. ""We want to make sure we get as many out there so people can be tested and confident they don't have COVID when they're out there in the community going about their business,"" he said. The tests can be picked up from vaccination clinics in Perth or from testing clinics in the regions. It comes after the state recorded 5,847 new cases but no new deaths. Hospital numbers remain steady, with 240 admissions, of which six are in intensive care.

235,Neighbours looking after neighbours. How’s this for an aged-care model?,health,"  Aged care at home service created by town of Bell sets new benchmark for locals looking after locals With its wide streets, coffee shop, a quintessential pub and affordable property, Bell on Queensland's Western Downs is the kind of country town older residents never want to leave. But for Joan Hunter, a fall at home nearly took that decision out of her hands. ""As I was trying to get through the screen door, I tumbled over, the basket went everywhere, and I went down on my side,"" she said. ""I must have damaged my hip because I couldn't really walk after that. So, then I knew I was in big trouble."" Joan's injuries left her unable to cook, clean, garden, shop, or drive herself to doctor's appointments. She was facing having to abandon her life in Bell and move to a nursing home near her children, not far from the coast, to receive full-time care. ""I have a big group of friends I've met since I've lived here, and I'd lose all that,"" she said. ""I'd still be lonely even though my children would be about."" But Joan was thrown a lifeline when Bell local Sarah Heathwood became her carer through an organisation called Bell Cares. Ms Heathwood visits several times a week, which allows Joan to stay in her home and in the town she loves. Bell Cares is a community-managed aged care service that helps the town's elderly residents access government-funded home care services, which locals then provide. The powerhouse behind the concept is Lesley Bryce, a Bell newcomer who moved with her husband to the town from the Sunshine Coast back in 2012. Ms Bryce said the idea for the tree change began when she and her husband came across the town's old bakery building on the internet. ""I came out and saw it and fell in love with it,"" she said. ""So, we bought it, thinking it would be a weekend getaway. But the more we came, the less we wanted to go back to the Sunshine Coast."" But during the pandemic, Ms Bryce became aware that Bell's elderly were not tapping into the government-funded support services they were entitled to. The nearest centre was 45km away, which placed Bell's elderly at a disadvantage when dealing with the major service providers. ""People [needing care] would say things like, 'They don't turn up, or they turn up on a different day. I don't like them. They send a different person every time.' ""There was no continuity of service. But I knew that could be different under a home care package,"" Ms Bryce said. Ms Bryce's research introduced her to the concept of self-managed home-care packages, which she realised would be the perfect fit for a small, tight-knit community like Bell. This model allows clients to tailor packages to their individual needs and have people they know from their town as support workers. As Bell Cares began to take shape, it linked with the online platform Mable to match elderly people with their carers. Mable's Qld community engagement manager Brad Grieve said the Bell Cares model was proof an ageing population was actually a powerful economic driver for any town. ""Because what it does is gives people who are ageing an opportunity to access government funding to keep them living in their home as intended,"" he said. ""But it also brings that extra money into town to spend, which creates local jobs."" The opportunity to gain work in their own backyard is being embraced by local workers as well. Since her youngest child started in prep, Sarah Heathwood had been looking for some extra work to add to the hours she was already doing at the local dairy, so becoming a part-time carer was exactly the sort of work she had been chasing. It also allowed her to gain new skills. ""She's tried to teach me to iron,"" Ms Heathwood said ""I still don't think I'm there. I really like to just pull it out of the cupboard and wear it. But there's been good learning on both sides, I think."" Bell Cares has partnered with Brisbane-based Home Care package provider Trilogy Care and serves as the intermediary between Trilogy and its Bell clients. Trilogy Care's managing director James Whitelaw believed community-managed home-care packages for the aged-care industry were what ride-share service Uber was to the taxi industry — a new disruptive concept. ""It's just not viable for the large-listed groups and the faith-based providers to get out into those communities, so we need to be innovative,"" Mr Whitelaw said. ""We're talking to towns in Western Australia, South Australia, and we've just spoken to 22 councils in Queensland. We want to see an expansion of this concept."" Aged & Community Services Australia chief executive officer Paul Sadler agreed the model offered an ideal solution for small communities but questioned whether there would be enough work for locals to make it worth their while. ""The staff are not employed. They're subcontractors, and that means they may not have the continuity of income to support their own families at times,"" he said. Bell Cares is still finding its financial feet and relies on private donations to get it through to the end of the year. But forward projections based on the number of people whose packages are going to be awarded and activated, Bell Cares will be breaking even paying wages and rent. ""Then if we have 50 packages running, which I suspect by the end of next year we will, that will bring in excess of a million dollars into this community,"" Ms Bryce said.

236,"SA records three COVID-linked deaths and 3,143 new cases",health,"  South Australia has recorded another three COVID-linked deaths and 3,143 new infections. The number of cases in hospital has risen to 257 — up by 28 since yesterday — and includes 15 people in intensive care and two on ventilation. The three people who died were all women — two of whom were aged in their 70s and another in her 80s. Today's daily caseload is up on yesterday's figure, despite a slight drop in PCR testing. There are 24,803 known active cases in South Australia, of a total of 413,321 since the start of the pandemic. School resumed for thousands of students across the state today, following holidays. All high school students and adults, including visitors, are still required to wear masks in school settings for another four weeks. Australian Education Union state branch president Andrew Gohl said while there were ""many views"" on that subject, he understood the current policy. ""I think we're all sick of wearing them, of course,"" he said. ""But it's the necessary last defence to ensure a safe workplace and a safe learning environment for students."" Mr Gohl said he hoped there was no return to widespread online learning this term, given the extra demands such a step would place on teachers. ""Many would be very reluctant to go back to a hybrid model or even teaching online,"" he said. ""It requires significant extra work, it's a different mode of learning and it requires a different set of support materials."" The state government recently committed to purchasing an extra 1,000 air purifiers for classrooms — a measure welcomed by the union. ""[In] instances where air ventilation is difficult then an air purifier makes good sense and … opening windows as we go into winter is simply not an option for a comfortable learning environment,"" Mr Gohl said. Meanwhile, it has been revealed another two South Australian Liberal MPs have contracted COVID-19. Former health minister Stephen Wade and opposition health spokeswoman Ashton Hurn today revealed they had come down with the virus. Opposition Leader David Speirs and deputy leader John Gardner tested positive last week and over the weekend.

238,'She'd be over the moon': Family of MND victim delighted by new funding support,health,"  Motor neurone disease support funding to provide vital equipment for those aged over 65 After her mum Dawn was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND) in 2019, Jaime Schultz watched helplessly as the woman she remembers as her ""role model"" and the ""life of the party"" succumbed to the effects. ""She used to sing in the house — [but] mum lost her voice after about 12 months, that was the first thing to go,"" said Ms Schultz, who lives in South Australia. ""Not being able to communicate verbally was really hard for her."" Barely two years after her diagnosis, Dawn Owen lost her battle with MND, and died in 2021 on June 21 — ironically, Ms Schultz said, on MND world awareness day. She said it was a battle made much harder by the fact that almost all the responsibility for her mum's care fell on her family. Like two thirds of MND patients, Mrs Owen was over the age of 65 when she was diagnosed and did not qualify for NDIS support. ""Dad's not young, bless him, but he was doing it on his own,"" Ms Schultz said. ""He was getting her out of bed, putting her in bed, getting her up and out of the chair, taking her to the bathroom, all the personal care he was doing, feeding her. ""You have to deal with the love of your life fading away in front of you. It's heartbreaking."" But a new funding deal in South Australia is now aiming to make that process a little more bearable, by delivering vital support. The SA government has committed $2.4 million for care provider Motor Neurone Disease SA (MNDSA) over the next four years. That amount includes $500,000 a year to help over-65s get immediate support to a ""multi-disciplinary team of health professionals"". Another $100,000 a year will go towards rapid-access loans to enable access to equipment, including devices for breathing, mobility and communication. ""At any one time, there are 150 South Australians living with MND, it has a huge impact on them [and] their family members,"" Health Minister Chris Picton said. ""We absolutely had to do something — particularly when we heard that South Australia is the only mainland state that doesn't provide state government help to its local MND support organisation."" MNDSA CEO Karen Percival described the funding as a ""game-changer for us"". ""It gives us certainty around staff planning, resource planning,"" she said. ""[MND] is one of the worst conditions that doctors have to diagnose and one of the most expensive in terms of equipment."" Adelaide grandfather Graham Johnson, who has been diagnosed with ALS — a type of MND — had been vocal in lobbying for such an outcome. While he counts himself ""lucky"" because he was diagnosed before the age of 65, and therefore already entitled to support, Mr Johnson said the new funding would result in inestimable benefits to those who remain ineligible for NDIS support. ""Speech pathology was really important, because my voice is starting to play up a little bit,"" he said. ""I want to keep talking to my grandchild."" Ms Schultz is likewise in no doubt as to what her mother would have made of the support. ""It's a huge announcement, so much money — so much needed money, and will go such a long way to help people in the same situation,"" she said. ""She'd be over the moon.""

239,"'I don't know if I'll get the old Lisa back': After personal tragedy, Lisa Curry is at a crossroads",health,"  Lisa Curry was the 'golden girl' of the pool. But there was one thing in life she couldn't control and it's left her at a crossroads In the quiet times, she tends her daughter's garden — planted so that something will always be in flower through each season. Jaimi loved flowers, especially pink ones, and this garden has been made in her memory. Lisa Curry — triple Olympian, elite athlete, golden girl — is almost 60 now, and a grandmother. It is a time of reflection on a life that has been lived at high velocity. A big life. A series of chapters. A life that, for 20 years, was measured in seconds. The seconds between winning and losing a race, breaking a record, getting a gold medal. Decades spent relentlessly swimming up and down that black line, pushing through, powering faster and stronger to shave off those seconds. A high performer in everything she does, at 60 she can look back on towering highs, resilience through the lows, a life filled with love, joy, disappointment and, in recent years, profound loss. The loss of her daughter and her mother. Her ""bookends"", as she calls them. She has been fundamentally changed by it. ""I just don't feel like the same person anymore. It's like your soul has changed,"" Lisa tells ABC's Australian Story. Now she knows what is important and not important in life. ""It's not about the medals, it's not about records, it's not about success and failure. It's about family, it's about love,"" Lisa says. Lisa's life has been a public one — much of it lived out in women's magazines or followed by the paparazzi. The wholesome blonde, beach girl. The super mum who kept swimming at an elite level after the birth of her daughters. The golden couple with her first husband Grant Kenny. The muscular epitome of health and positivity. The birth of each child has been shared, along with every milestone — and some questionable hairstyles. ""I had the worst hairstyles in the history of Australian personalities,"" Lisa laughs. ""Like, seriously, I had the 80s hairstyle, I had a Billy Idol hairstyle, I had a shocking perm."" Her son Jett agrees: ""Mum's never been one for fashion, I don't think that was ever her strong point."" Lisa, says her friend Rose Fydler, ""seems to glow in public, she has thrived on it"". ""In the heyday, in the 80s and 90s, when magazines were big, she would have moved tens of thousands of copies."" Her friend, Janet Hine, says the world grew up with Lisa and her family. ""I think everyone just grew up with each child that was born. Everybody felt that they knew them [Lisa's family],"" she says. However, beneath the sunny facade, the past 18 years have been struggle and sadness that no one knew about: Trauma that would ultimately claim the life of her eldest child. Today, living on a lush property on the Sunshine Coast with her second husband, Mark Tabone, along with animals and wildlife, out on her ride-on mower, Lisa considers herself ""a modern boho hippie who swam for a while"". The woman who could never sit still, was always busy, who had an unshakeable work ethic, always reaching goals is — for the time being — living at a slower, more contemplative pace while she navigates this raw phase of her life. ""I'm at a crossroads,"" Lisa says. During this time, she has sorted through her memories, opened up old shoeboxes full of medals, to write her memoir Lisa: 60 Years of Life, Love and Loss. It was, she writes: ""A different journey, and one that hurt in different ways. The achievements and failures. The soaring loves and the losses too painful to bear."" Growing up in Brisbane, Lisa had a typically active Australian childhood, going to the Gold Coast beaches on the weekends. One ""stinking hot"" summer day in 1972 she was spotted at the pool by Harry Gallagher, who had coached Dawn Fraser to three gold medals. Harry told her parents they would have to get her teeth straightened because ""she's going to have her photo taken a lot"". Lisa was 10 years old. She loved swimming and training so much. ""Mum never had to wake me up. Some days I was so excited I'd sleep in my togs,"" Lisa remembers. That never changed in the two decades that were to come. She would make up for lack of stature or talent with sheer hard work and rigorous discipline. ""My mantra from all those years is. 'If you are going to do something, do it properly, do it 110 per cent'."" Friend Rose Fydler says Lisa has always been ""supremely self-confident"", even as a teenager. ""She knew exactly who she was. And, not only that, she liked who she was."" Lisa estimates she would ultimately swim more than 40,000 kilometres: ""Tracking that relentless black line at the bottom of the pool. Up and down until I knew every crack in the pool tiles and how many strokes it would take me to get to the other end, how many breaths I could take."" By the time she was 14, Lisa was one of the fastest swimmers for her age in the world. By 18, she was at the Moscow Olympics, coming fifth in the 100-metre butterfly. Lisa remembers sitting on her bed with a stopwatch. ""I'd see myself on the blocks. Even now, I can actually feel the blocks under my feet. I can remember the texture. I would start the stopwatch, dive in, I'd stop the stopwatch and was pretty spot on, a couple of tenths of a second either side of what I wanted to do."" At the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982, in front of a home crowd, she would win three gold medals, breaking a Commonwealth record in the 200-metre medley. ""The crowd lifted the roof off that pool,"" she recalls. Suddenly, she was a star: ""I wasn't really anybody. But, after the Commonwealth Games, I was somebody. I became one of the poster girls — Lisa Forrest and Tracey Wickham, myself — the mean machine."" On the last night of swimming, she crossed paths with Grant Kenny on his way to meet the Queen. Grant was famously ""hot"", a pin-up, a star ironman, on TV every night promoting Nutri-Grain cereals. ""And, then, we accidentally bumped into each other at five o'clock the next morning at Sunnybank pub,"" Lisa remembers. Newly famous, people had been buying her drinks all night: ""I was basically holding up the door when Grant walked in."" After he left to go to training, she told her friend: 'I'm going to marry that guy.'"" The pair married in 1986 — she was 23, he 22. ""We thought we were mature,"" Lisa recalls. It was the Queensland sports' wedding of the year. ""It was 80s over-the-top,"" Grant's sister, Melinda Kenny, says. Together the couple was irresistible to the media and marketers: He was the golden boy of the surf, she was the golden girl of the pool. Lisa began doing the commercials for Uncle Toby's. The following year, their daughter, Jaimi Lee, was born. ""She was a beautiful, beautiful baby,"" Lisa remembers. Former swimmer and friend Georgie Parkes says the pair were alike. ""Jaimi had very many traits of her mother. She was strong-willed, she was very determined, even from a tiny little tot."" Lisa had given no thought to swimming again but, in 1988, she was at the World Masters Swimming Championships in Brisbane. There she saw the American Sandy Neilson-Bell, who had won three gold medals at the Munich Summer Olympics, retired for five years and come back to swim faster than any Australian woman ever had in the 50m and 100m freestyle at the age of 33. ""My events,"" Lisa says. ""I said to Grant: 'I know I can swim fast again.'"" She hadn't been in a pool for five years. ""The first time I dived into a pool I just felt like a big brick,"" she writes in her book. For the first month, she had to push through: ""Nothing felt natural, everything felt heavy and hurt."" Friend Georgie Parkes says Lisa was a trailblazer. ""There were not many mothers who were swimming at world top-class levels. So, to have a baby, and we know the impact that has on your body, and getting yourself back into fitness, into high-performance shape, is phenomenal."" Training for the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, Lisa was often up all night with Jaimi. Swimming against Susie O'Neill, who was 10 years younger, she looked for the psychological edge. ""I just had to be smart about it, I had to play with her a little bit."" She won four gold medals and a silver, breaking Commonwealth records. ""It was just being able to prove to everyone that it can be done, you've just got to do the work."" She retired at the top, had another baby, Morgan, and a year later — at the age of 29 — started training for the Barcelona Olympic Games. ""So many people told me I couldn't do it,"" Lisa writes. ""People said I was way too old, had no time to train and too many responsibilities. Dawn Fraser said publicly that I should hang up my goggles and leave it to the younger kids."" Her swimming career was 14 years long — almost unheard of. And she came so close. ""But there was just that one thing that I never got, which is what I wanted, which is that just like one Olympic medal."" Two years later, her son Jett was born and the family was complete. Lisa never slowed down and she continued working, dealing with her endorsements, public speaking and designing her Hot Curry Swimwear. One day the phone rang, and it was Prime Minister John Howard asking her to be chair of the Australia Day Council. ""I was in important meetings and felt grown up."" After 28 years together the golden couple was no more. Lisa and Grant parted amicably. ""We just felt like we were kind of going in different directions after so many years. We're still great mates."" Lisa moved down the road and Jett, who was 14, would ""skate down the road to mum's for dinner"". Despite the split, the pair would always remain united in their support for daughter Jaimi, who started becoming unwell with an eating disorder at age 15. “She swam very well, and then she just suddenly quit because the kids at school started saying she looked like a boy, and she had muscles,” Lisa says. Jaimi had so many gifts, her mother says. ""Jaimi was an amazing cook. She's an amazing stylist, photography. ""[But] she didn't feel like she was good enough at anything. She was. We could see it. She couldn't see it."" In her book, Lisa writes that Jaimi had a smile that could light up a room. ""She was an intelligent, beautiful girl, yet in her eyes — in her head — she was not good at anything and hated the way she looked. ""We tried so hard to understand what was going on in her mind."" As an adult, Jaimi developed an alcohol addiction. ""So it was a triple whammy. Not eating, bingeing and drinking all at once,"" Lisa says. The husband of one of Lisa's friends, Mark Forbes, started endED, an organisation that provides support for families and carers of those suffering from eating disorders. He became a source of information and support for Lisa and her family. ""If somebody has an eating disorder for any great length of time, they're trapped and they don't know how to escape this thing, this beast that's got them, so they turn to another addiction to soften what's going on,"" Mark says. ""Early intervention is the key because, unfortunately, if it's been in your child for quite some time, it's bloody hard to get rid of."" Lisa and Grant saw doctors, specialists, psychologists, psychiatrists and ""almost weekly medical interventions"". ""Everyone was trying and failing to get to the bottom of Jaimi's deep hurt."" There was confusion, Lisa says: ""How do we fix this? But no one could tell us what to do or how to fix things or what to say. And so we were all really confused about how to even navigate this thing."" Jett lived through it. ""I saw everything — the hospital visits, the ambulances, all that kind of thing. Like, I lived with that every single day."" Every year, it got worse. ""We didn't know how to fix it,"" Lisa writes of her fragile daughter. ""We wish we could have. All Jaimi's friends and family tried to help her. We were all living with it, and it was heartbreaking to watch."" She tells Australian Story: ""She needed to go to long-term rehab because it takes time to get through all those layers, but Jaimi was an adult. We couldn't make her go."" Friend Georgie says the family ""left no stone unturned, they never gave up"". When Jaimi was 28, the doctors told them she might not make her 30th birthday. Lisa says every moment after that she was on edge with worry. ""Every day, every week, every month after that, it's like, 'Is this the hospital visit she won't come home from? I haven't heard from her for five days, where is she? What's her state of mind?' ""I wanted to shout out, 'Can anyone help my child?' This went on for about five years. We never knew when that last day was going to be."" When Morgan had her son Flynn, Jaimi was, her brother Jett says, ""vibrant and happy … she just wanted a family and her own kids"". After her marriage ended, Lisa was ""cautious"" and ""couldn't be bothered"" with another relationship. ""I could sleep when I wanted to. I could go where I wanted to. I didn't have to be accountable to anyone,"" she wrote. However, she met Mark Tabone in June 2015 on a charity walk. He is an Elvis impersonator and ""he's incredible at what he does"", Jett says. Lisa took her friends to a performance. Mark, who was single after a 25-year marriage, had watched Lisa at the Olympics and wanted to impress her. Lisa introduced him to her friend, Georgie. ""He was very calm and quiet. And, half an hour later, boom, the show starts and out comes this guy who was just phenomenal,"" Georgie says. Lisa thought, ""You know what, he is actually really nice. He's funny and caring, he is interesting and he had a Kombi and I had a Kombi."" They both love 60s music. When they were married, in May 2015, Lisa looked spectacular. ""I think he's been perfect for mum,"" Jett says. Jaimi made it to her 30th birthday. But, says Jett, ""You could sort of see her health declining"". ""In my heart, I just knew that the hope is diminishing,"" Lisa says. ""You never give up hope. You're always looking for something to turn the corner because life can be beautiful. But they have to want it."" On Jaimi's 33rd birthday, in June 2020, they had a picnic at the hospital with cupcakes. It would be her last. ""The doctors said that her liver was failing but, in the end, it was multiple organ failure,"" Lisa says. ""We were there when she took her first breath, and we were then when she took her last."" Just over 18 months since Jaimi died, Lisa says she's full of ""What-ifs"". ""We didn't have the education to pick up on red flags, signals or triggers. We just didn't know."" She admits she has spent much of the past two years ""crying and eating"". Her grief was monumental, she was ""drowning in the pain"". ""I'm still in the state where I am still trying to work it out because I can't work it out. And it's annoying me, because if I can help someone else, if I can say, 'Here's something that I've learnt', it might help another family's kid, but I can't seem to do it. ""If I knew the answers, I'd be shouting it to the world."" For the first time in her life, Lisa doesn't know which way to go. ""But the important part is to just start walking in any direction and see where it takes you. It's time to start finding Lisa again."" And, as Lisa sits in what she's dubbed ""Jaimi's garden"" at her Sunshine Coast home — which she and Mark created — she takes a moment to think about her firstborn child. When she thinks about Jaimi, a little willy wagtail appears to keep her company. She has called it Jaimi Wagtail. ""I don't know if I will get the old Lisa back. I hope so.""

240,"Filomena and Denise are friends, but they never knew they shared the same medical journey since the 1960s",health,"  The world's longest respiratory health study involves thousands of Tasmanians Back in the early 1960s, researchers were seeing a rise in asthma, and wanted to know why. They tested 8,500 Tasmanian children's lung function, and have followed the participants' lives ever since, becoming the world's longest respiratory health study. In a function room at a Hobart hotel, 50 participants and researchers in the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) have now come together. All the participants, or 'probands' as they are scientifically known, have been part of the study since 1968, but they've never met en masse before. Surprised faces are aplenty in the room as participants see old school mates, who they had no idea were part of the study. Filomena Wise and Denise Armstrong became friends 30 years ago, when studying teaching. ""I saw her name on the guest list and I got in contact with her and said, 'I had no idea you were part of this study',"" Ms Armstrong said. In another corner of the room, half a dozen staff members who all work at the Royal Hobart Hospital find it amusing they didn't know they were all probands in this study. Karen Gower Bradley was one of the original recruits that had her lung function tested as a child, and initiated the idea of having this get together to commemorate the 60th birth year of all the participants. ""We'd all travelled this road for 60 years together and it was a real important milestone for all of us in our own lives,"" she said. ""Sixty is a great age to get to because life starts to get exciting around this age cause you're free to do things."" Ms Gower Bradley, who was a presenter on 7.30 at ABC Hobart in the 1980s, remembers going to tests with her mother as a child, and when older, filling in the forms the TAHS sent her in the mail. ""I [kept going with the study] out of loyalty to my mum, but then became engaged with it and thought, 'actually, this maybe matters because it's a long form study that shows the passage of people right through their life',"" she said. ""If the study keeps running, then that collection of data over the course of a person's life living in a particular place is really invaluable."" The TAHS was established by Heather Gibson, who helped create the School Medical Service in Tasmania, and respiratory physician Bryan Gandevia, both of whom were supported by statistician Harold Silverstone. In 1968, 8,500 Tasmanian children's lung function was tested. Their parents and any siblings were also surveyed, a total of almost 46,000 people. Eight years later, lung function testing was performed on a sample of 850 of the original 8,500 participants. Since then, TAHS has regularly conducted surveys asking participants about their lifestyle, what type of heating they used, where they worked, and even how close they lived to a main road. More recently, they've been asked to undergo an MRI to better understand respiratory health as we grow older. Shyamali Dharmage has been the principal investigator of TAHS since 2001 and understands the significant impact the study's findings have had on creating paradigm shifts in thinking in this area. ""TAHS changed scientific knowledge about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a respiratory illness that impacts large numbers of people, particularly in older age,"" Professor Dharmage said. ""Previously, COPD was seen as a 'smoker's disease', but the TAHS revealed other health and environmental factors from childhood and throughout life which influence the risk and severity of COPD. ""In clinical practice, the early detection of COPD has been made easier due to knowledge of these risk factors."" Those afflicted with asthma have been advised by the TAHS that they use preventative medication to reduce the severity instead of just using it when symptoms occur. Sufferers of sleep apnoea can also thank the TAHS for Medicare rebates being expanded for treatment by specialists. TAHS has just begun its latest follow up that will run through to 2027 with their original recruits, as research shows COPD worsens from the age of 60. ""A subset of participants, those with lower-level lung capacity and average capacity, will be invited for CT scans that take images of the lungs so we can look for changes in lung structure associated with lung capacity,"" Professor Dharmage said. An essential part of this follow up is also trying to get in contact with as many of the original participants as possible with an ambitious target of finding 4,000 of them who are now scattered all over the world. Ms Gower Bradley is one of the participants that has been able to undertake some of the more complex testing in recent times, such as an MRI, and hopes as many participants as possible can continue to contribute to the study. ""I am very glad to be part of it because it all adds to the store house of health knowledge that is so important to us,"" she said. The Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study is seeking to find as many of the original participants it can so that it can continue its legacy of improving respiratory health. If you or a person you know were born in 1960 or 1961 and think might be an original participant, you can contact TAHS at the University of Melbourne on 1800 110 711 or email inq-tas@unimelb.edu.au.

241,More Senior Australians to get cheaper health care and medication under $70m Coalition election pitch,health,"  More self-funded retirees would be able to access cheaper health care and medication under a multi-million-dollar Coalition election promise to tackle cost-of-living pressures for tens of thousands of older Australians. If elected in the May poll, the Coalition is promising to spend $70 million over four years giving an extra 50,000 older Australians access to the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC). The card is currently issued to about 436,000 Australians over 67 who do not qualify for the age pension because the value of their assets is too high and gives them access to some cheaper Medicare services and prescription medicines. It comes with a singles income test of just under $58,000 a year, but the Coalition is proposing to expand eligibility for the card by increasing that to $90,000 from July 1. The couples' threshold would also rise from just over $92,000 to $144,000. The surging cost of living has been front and centre during this federal election campaign for Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese, with both sides arguing they were best placed to help Australians combat higher prices. Mr Morrison used the election pitch to again argue the Coalition was mitigating rising household pressures. ""This is the first major change, outside of indexation, to the income threshold of the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card in over 20 years,"" he said. ""Every dollar counts, especially for older Australians who are no longer working. ""Senior Australians have worked hard to make Australia all that it is today, and it's important that the country takes care of them in return."" Labor says it will match the pledge, with campaign spokesman Jason Clare telling Channel Seven it is a good idea. Regardless of who wins the election, PBS medications will be cheaper. With the federal election underway, it can be hard to keep up with where each party stands on some of the key issues. We've made a little cheat sheet to make it easier. By next year, all Australians will be paying less for medications on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), regardless of who wins the May election. The Coalition announced on Saturday that all PBS drugs would be cut by $10 to a maximum of $32.50 should it be returned to government, after accidentally announcing and then retracting the policy last month. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese used Labor's campaign launch on Sunday to outbid the government by $2.50, announcing the cost of PBS medication would be slashed by $12.50. Shadow Health Minister Mark Butler told the ABC that prescription drugs were currently too expensive. ""Hundreds of thousands of people aren't accessing the medicines that their doctors say they need simply because of cost,"" he said. ""This is a core issue of equity and universality of healthcare."" Pharmacy Guild of Australia president Trent Twomey welcomed bipartisan support for the policy, describing it as a step in the right direction. ""Community pharmacies see patients struggling to afford medicines from prescription to prescription and from pay cheque to pay cheque,"" Professor Twomey said. ""As the cost of living rises, patients are increasingly finding themselves being forced to choose between putting food on the table or buying the medicines they and their families need. ""We don't want to see Australians ending up in emergency, in hospital, or with long-term damage to their health because they have been forced to delay or skip taking essential medicines due to cost."" Both parties have promised their pharmaceutical pledges would come into effect early next year.

242,How a politically connected company earned more than $1 billion from the pandemic,health,"  Health Minister Greg Hunt wrote and signed a glowing letter of commendation for a politically connected healthcare company while it was in the midst of negotiations with his department for lucrative multi-million-dollar PPE deals. Canberra-based Aspen Medical would go on to win taxpayer-funded contracts — without a public tender — worth more than $1.1 billion. After combined losses of $7 million over 2018 and 2019, these deals have seen the company's pre-tax profits soar to more than $420 million during the pandemic. While Aspen Medical had no prior experience in such large-scale procurement, its PPE deals with the Department of Health were worth $500 million more than any other government supplier, including those with a background in the industry. A Four Corners investigation, in collaboration with Colombo's Sunday Times, also established that Aspen Medical has been embroiled in an international criminal probe into corruption and money laundering. The letter from Mr Hunt, under the Commonwealth government crest, described Aspen as, ""a world-recognised, nationally awarded company"" and ""a trusted supplier of … health services to the Australian government"". It was left undated and addressed: ""To whom it may concern."" The document was prepared and signed, however, in late February 2020. In a statement to Four Corners, Aspen Medical said that throughout February it was filling ""initial smaller orders placed with us by the Department of Health for PPE … not pursuant to a contract"", which ""began increasing in size"". Department of Health documents released under Freedom of Information legislation show one contract for PPE was executed on February 22, 2020. The letter also came after the company had been hastily engaged — with no proper contract in place — to procure thermometers for Australian ports and airports. Former Health Department Secretary Stephen Duckett said he had never seen a letter like it. ""Here we have a minister in charge — or who's a minister assisting in the area of the public service — writing a letter, which is highly dubious, undated, fulsome, to 'Whom it may concern',"" Mr Duckett said. ""We've got no idea, neither does he, in what context Aspen Medical would use this letter."" He said the fact that Mr Hunt signed it while the government was in talks with Aspen Medical was remarkable. ""So it is extraordinarily unusual and, in fact, dangerous for a minister — or in fact for a public servant — to actually have any contact, any engagement, and certainly to write a letter of this kind."" Aspen Medical confirmed to Four Corners it had asked Mr Hunt for the letter. Mr Hunt's spokesman said it was ""written to support Aspen Medical in tendering for work in the United States and is appropriate for Australian firms assisting in international activity"". In respect of the company's PPE contracts, the minister categorically denied any involvement in any ""purchasing recommendations, assessments, approvals, contract negotiations or decisions"". ""Minister Hunt did not discuss any contractual terms with Aspen Medical or any of their agents,"" his spokesman said, and described Mr Hunt's engagement with Aspen as ""minimal"". Like other suppliers to the National Medical Stockpile, Aspen Medical was selected without having to compete in a public tender. This was to ensure Australia was able to move quickly to secure vital supplies of PPE in what had rapidly become a fierce international contest. The federal government's procurement guidelines — which usually require a public tender for large contracts — were only formally suspended, however, after Aspen had begun filling federal government orders for PPE. Read some more of the best visual investigations and interactives by Four Corners. ""The point of probity rules is to get the best value for money and some people might call it red tape but there's a trade-off between efficiency and urgency,"" Mr Duckett said. Mr Hunt defended the value for money achieved in the government's PPE procurement, pointing to positive findings by the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), which said the equipment was priced within an appropriate range. The ANAO found that — although there were ""inconsistent due diligence checks of suppliers"" and sometimes insufficient record keeping — the stockpile procurements were ""largely consistent with the proper use and management of public resources"". The company has enjoyed ties with senior ranks of the government and the parliamentary Liberal Party for more than a decade, including through introductions made by former Liberal health minister Michael Wooldridge, a former board member and lobbyist for the company. Dr Wooldridge is currently a director of Aspen's $1.3 billion joint venture in Indonesia. Even during the period in which Dr Wooldridge was banned as a company director by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission — over fiduciary breaches concerning the collapse of a retirement village investment scheme — the former politician continued to attend Aspen Medical board meetings as an adviser. Mr Hunt's spokesman said: ""We are not aware of, nor have any record of, any lobbying by Dr Wooldridge on behalf of Aspen Medical in relation to any procurement."" Between 2009 and 2021, Aspen Medical gave the Liberal Party more than $110,000 through political donations and fundraising attendances, including a $13,200 donation made to the Queensland LNP on the day Prime Minister Scott Morrison closed Australia's borders to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The company has also been a regular donor to the Australian Labor Party, giving it almost $54,000 in donations and other receipts over the same 12-year period. This year, the company attracted headlines over a $40 million contract which, The Australian said, it had received ""in a secret deal"" with the Palaszczuk government to provide health services at a new Queensland quarantine facility. The Queensland Premier defended the decision, claiming Aspen Medical was the only suitable operator for the job. Since 2007, the company has been awarded contracts without open tender by the departments of Foreign Affairs, Health, Defence and Customs and Border Protection. However, after 2016 — when the company's major deal with Defence to staff its on-base health clinics around Australia was not renewed — the company found itself in an increasingly perilous financial position. By 2019, it was going backwards, sustaining pre-tax losses that year of almost $5 million. The federal government's 2020 pandemic spending program, however, led to a dramatic reversal of fortune. Aspen picked up contracts to do everything from administering vaccines to staffing aged care homes. By July 2021, Aspen Medical's pre-tax profit had rocketed to $277 million. Aspen Medical told Four Corners it had a ""successful track record of procuring medical goods and equipment, including PPE, in support of our health solutions"" throughout Australia and overseas. It also said it has relationships ""with multiple national and international suppliers"". Four Corners has also established that Aspen Medical has been embroiled in a top-level money laundering investigation after its involvement in a multi-million-dollar hospital project in Hambantota, on Sri Lanka's southern coast. It was a 2012 project for which the company had obtained formal Australian government support through an $18.8 million insurance guarantee from the then-Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC — now Export Finance Australia). In a report to parliament, EFIC said it made the commitment on the basis that the company had been hired to ""supply equipment and associated medical design and infrastructure for the hospital"". Aspen declined to answer questions from Four Corners as to whether it ever did supply any equipment or medical design. The company's statement said its subcontract with EN-Projects, a Dutch company running the project, ""covered the provision of a range of hospital engineering services"" and that it had ""engaged over 20 suppliers"". However, Aspen Medical's first transaction in Sri Lanka — the payment of 1.4 million euros ($2.1 million) to a mysterious British-Virgin Islands-domiciled company called Sabre Vision Holdings — is what caught the attention of Colombo police. It was part of 4.3 million euros and $US537,000 ($759,000) remitted, in total, to the offshore company by Aspen Medical, EN-Projects and German company Juga Bau GmbH, which police ""suspected … is a derivative or a result of an illegal activity"". The company was secretly owned by a middleman, Nimal Perera, notorious for his links to the Rajapaksa family which has dominated Sri Lankan politics for decades. In 2016, he confessed to collecting money for the prime minister's son, Namal Rajapaksa, which led to Mr Rajapaksa's arrest. When police investigating the hospital deal first questioned Mr Perera about the source of unexplained funds that had arrived in his personal bank accounts, he told them it was an Italian businessman whose identity he could not substantiate with an address or a phone number. Asked further about Sabre Vision Holdings, he told the police he did not ""know anything about"" the company, and added that he believed ""the company could be related to his Italian friend"". It was only when police received corporate documents from the British Virgin Islands that they learned the company was not owned by an anonymous Italian businessman, but by Mr Perera himself. Pressed by Four Corners about why he had lied to the police, Mr Perera said: ""No, I don't want to answer, sorry."" Mr Perera confirmed he had never worked in the health sector and said that he had nothing to do with Aspen Medical. He had worked as an agent for EN-Projects, he said. In 2013, Sabre Vision Holdings received hundreds of thousands of US dollars that had been paid out in a global bribery scheme orchestrated by EADS, the parent company of aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Airbus's campaign of kickbacks in Sri Lanka, and around the world, became the subject of a deferred prosecution agreement between Airbus and Britain's Serious Fraud Office and, in January 2020, Airbus paid $US4 billion to settle the corruption investigation with French, British and US authorities. Aspen Medical said it had not received ""any requests from any government agency or court of law anywhere in the world"" regarding the hospital project but would support any such inquiries. It added that the Airbus scandal only became public in 2019, years after its payments to Sabre Vision Holdings. Aspen Medical said: ""We have a strong set of values that would preclude us working with organisations involved in corrupt practices.""

243,"SA records two COVID-linked deaths and 3,070 new cases",health,"  Two men who tested positive for COVID-19 have died in South Australia, where the number of patients in hospital with the virus has fallen. SA today reported 3,070 new infections — about 900 fewer than yesterday, but coinciding with a drop in PCR testing. One of the men who died was aged in his 40s, and the other was in his 50s. The number of patients in SA's hospitals with the virus has fallen by 21, to 229. That includes 16 people in intensive care and one person on a ventilator. ""Hospitalisations tend to lag a few weeks behind the case rate, so we are expecting to fall over the coming weeks,"" Health Minister Chris Picton said. ""[They] will stabilise at a figure, the modelling says, of around 120 to 200 people in hospital."" The number of current active cases also fell, to 24,792. Mr Picton said he expected that number to also stabilise, despite the relaxation of close contact rules. Close contacts of COVID-19 cases no longer have to quarantine, bringing the state into line with interstate rules. SA Premier Peter Malinauskas yesterday expressed concerns about COVID in aged care homes, amid several outbreaks. ""We've got a number of facilities in South Australia where COVID unfortunately has got in,"" he said. ""We know that once COVID gets into an aged care setting, it's very hard to get it out. But this is something we're going to monitor."" Mr Malinauskas said he expected the cycle of ""peaks and troughs"" in COVID numbers to continue. ""There is a likelihood that there will be another wave but we don't know when that will happen. What we see in South Australia is that that typically occurs behind the eastern states,"" he said. There have been 348 COVID-linked deaths in SA, and 409,717 cases, since the start of the pandemic.

244,The latest COVID-19 case numbers from around the states and territories,health,"  Here's a quick wrap of each Australian jurisdiction's latest COVID-19 statistics for Sunday, May 1. You can get a more detailed, visual breakdown through the ABC's Charting the Spread story here. You can jump to the COVID-19 information you want to read by clicking below. WA has recorded 5,551 new COVID cases. There are more than 43,000 known active cases across the state. Seven people are being treated in intensive care, with 221 people hospitalised in total. Victoria has recorded another seven COVID-related deaths. There were 7,654 new cases across the state in the latest reporting period, bringing the number of active cases to 55,513. There are 437 people in Victorian hospitals after contracting COVID-19. Of those patients, 30 are in intensive care units and three are on ventilators. The state has recorded almost 3,000 COVID-related deaths since the first infection was detected in 2020. More than 67 per cent of Victorian adults have had at least three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Tasmania has recorded 816 new COVID-19 cases and one new COVID-related death. Three people are being treated in intensive care and, in total, 43 are in hospital. However, only 19 are being treated specifically for COVID-19 symptoms. The number of known active cases in the state has dropped slightly compared to yesterday, down from 6,322 to 6,289. Two men aged in their 40s and 50s have died in South Australia after testing positive for COVID-19. The number of patients in SA’s hospitals with the virus has fallen to 229. There are 16 people being treated for the virus in ICU and one person is on a ventilator. The state has recorded 3,070 new infections reported, but less PCR tests were undertaken yesterday compared to previous days. Queensland has recorded 5,333 new cases of COVID-19. There are 446 people being treated for the virus in hospital, 14 of whom are in intensive care. Health authorities have not been notified of any COVID-related deaths in the latest reporting period. One patient remains in intensive care with COVID-19 in the Northern Territory, with 50 people, in total, in hospital with the virus, a small increase on yesterday. The territory has recorded 279 new cases, putting the number of known active cases at 2,807. Both the number of new cases recorded today and the number of active cases are down slightly compared to yesterday. Health authorities in New South Wales say another five people have died with COVID-19, a reduction from the 20 deaths recorded yesterday. There are 1,604 people in hospital with the virus, and 75 of them are requiring treatment in intensive care. The state has recorded 9,303 new cases, down from 11,709 yesterday. Another 823 COVID-19 cases have been reported by health authorities in the Australian Capital Territory today. There are 69 people in hospital with COVID-19, three of whom are in intensive care. Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman says that — although symptom-free household contacts of COVID-19 cases do not need to quarantine anymore under eased restrictions — people who have been exposed to the virus should still consider whether they need to be out and about. ""I do hope that these changes will provide some relief to many workplaces and businesses that have been under pressure due to workforce shortages,"" Dr Coleman says. ""Also, being able to go outside for a walk should help those of us who may have struggled being stuck inside for that seven-day period.""

245,"'It's been a long road': There are no surrogacy laws in the NT, but that's likely to change soon",health,"  Surrogacy likely to be legalised in the Northern Territory, bringing it into line with the rest of Australia Kelsey and Aaron Rouse describe their six-and-a-half-year struggle with infertility as an ""ongoing nightmare"". The Darwin couple has spent more than $70,000 trying to have a baby: visiting two separate IVF clinics and having 13 embryo transfers. Ten of those transfers failed, and three ended in miscarriage. ""It's been a really, really long journey,"" Mrs Rouse said. ""We create the perfect embryos, it's my uterus that cannot hold a pregnancy."" Mr and Mrs Rouse are hoping to fall pregnant in the final two rounds of IVF they have committed to this year. But if this fails, Mrs Rouse, now 35, said the couple could be ""out of options"" — unless the territory legalises surrogacy. The NT is the only jurisdiction in Australia with no surrogacy laws, meaning intending parents need to move interstate or travel overseas to access the service. Mr and Mrs Rouse have considered moving, but they were both born in the territory and have built their lives here together, over the course of their 18-year relationship. ""It's our home, our families are here,"" Mrs Rouse said. ""If we couldn't do surrogacy up here, we would move … but we'd have to uproot our entire lives."" Mrs Rouse works as a teacher and Mr Rouse runs his own carpentry business: they said if they needed to relocate, it's unlikely they'd be able to move back. Victorian surrogacy and family lawyer Sarah Jefford said she knows dozens of Northern Territory families who have left the territory to access surrogacy interstate or used one based overseas. This year, after years of waiting, territory families may be able to access surrogacy locally for the first time. In 2018, Health Minister Natasha Fyles asked her government to look at developing surrogacy laws. The surrogacy bill was finally introduced in NT Parliament in March this year and – pending any amendments – is expected to be debated in May. Ms Fyles said the legislation had the support of the Northern Territory Labor government, which had the majority of the parliament, and meant the bill was likely to pass. Shadow Minster for Health Bill Yan said the opposition also supported the proposed bill ""in principal"" and he ""looked forward"" to the debate in May. If it passes, Ms Fyles said eligible families could be able to surrogacy legally by the end of 2022. Mrs Rouse said this could be ""absolutely perfect timing"" for her family's situation. They're still hopeful to conceive using IVF, but if the next two rounds fail, one of their friends has volunteered to carry the Rouses' baby to term. ""We've been so lucky to have such a wonderful offer from our friends, except we cannot do surrogacy in the NT,"" Mrs Rouse said. ""Surrogacy may be the only hope … we cannot imagine our lives without children."" Ms Fyles said the bill had been ""a long time coming"" but it was an ""important, complex"" piece of legislation which had been ""designed around the best interest of the child"". The bill does not allow for commercial surrogacy – where the surrogate is paid – but Ms Fyles said intending parents can help cover ""reasonable costs"" such as medical expenses. The surrogate is also in control of their pregnancy, and parentage transfers over at birth. Both surrogates and intending parents must undergo counselling, be over the age of 25 and be an Australian citizen or permanent resident. Ms Jefford, who is also an IVF mum, egg donor, former surrogate and running as a Greens candidate in the federal seat of Wills, said she was ""very happy"" with the bill, which was similar to laws in other Australian states and territories. ""It's really good that there's a statement in there saying the surrogate maintains her bodily autonomy just as any other pregnant person,"" she said. Ms Jefford's only criticisms were that the bill did not allow people from New Zealand, who could have been living in Australia for ""most of their lives"", to qualify, and that it had been a long time coming. ""We had surrogacy laws across the rest of Australia anywhere from 2004, 2008 and here in Victoria where I am, it's been in place since 2010,"" she said. ""It could have happened a bit sooner, but now is as good a time as any."" Rebecca Want de Rowe, who has been campaigning for the introduction of surrogacy laws in the NT since 2018, is waiting for the bill to officially pass before celebrating. Ahead of the debate, Ms Want de Rowe has scheduled meetings with opposition and independent members, bringing them stories from NT families – including Mr and Mrs Rouse – to illustrate what surrogacy could mean for Territorians. Tara and Luke are about to become parents using a donor egg and a surrogate. But the NT is the only place in Australia with no surrogacy laws, and the family's journey is far from over. ""It's been a long road,"" Ms Want de Rowe said. ""I'm feeling anxious, hoping that it gets through. ""There's a lot of families that have been waiting years for this and with every year that goes by they're getting older."" Mrs Rouse wanted families in the NT – herself and Aaron included – to have the option to access surrogacy close to home if they chose. ""There needs to be good reason to keep this life-changing bill from Territorians, when the rest of Australians have had access for years,"" she said. ""If having a biological child doesn't happen because it's physically impossible, then that's a hurdle we've got to get over. ""But if it doesn't happen because the NT government doesn't legalise surrogacy: that's bulls***.""

246,"Just 1 per cent of Australians think this is the most important election issue, and it might surprise you",health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes As the nation gets ready to cast its vote in the federal election, the number one issue that has affected Australians over the last term of government is no longer front of mind for many of us. But as life returns to normal in Australia, the impact of the pandemic lives on for many. From labour force shortages to the economy and health care, COVID-19 has created boons and wounds across the country — and these have shaped what people now need from their leaders. So as we move into an era of living with the virus, how has it changed what people think, feel and need from the federal government? According to Vote Compass data, just 1 per cent of Australians think COVID is the most important issue this election. But while many have already moved on, the virus is still front of mind for Adelaide woman Belle Owen. As COVID restrictions ease around Australia and masks come off, Ms Owen is doubling down every time she leaves the house. Living with a disability, she is considered vulnerable to the virus and the decision to just leave the house comes with a pressing question. “It’s weighing up, is this worth potentially this being a thing that I catch COVID for?” she said. Ms Owen said, for the most part, the pandemic was ""handled really well"". But as Australia opens up, she feels forgotten about. ""Now we’re coming towards the end of the pandemic, [vulnerable] people have been seen as collateral,"" she said. COVID-19 has also shaped what she is looking for from leaders. “The response to COVID has kind of really concreted for me that we need government who sees us as valuable and not dispensable,” she said It has also shored up for her that she wants a cautious government that prioritises community health and safety. “I'm really hoping that, when the election is settled and we have a government formed, they can go away and get a group of people together who have that lived experience, and work with [the disability] community to prioritise community safety,"" she said. While the impacts of the coronavirus were brutal for many, for others it has shown what works well. WA was the last state in the country to open its borders to the virus. The decision meant total deaths and hospitalisations from COVID-19 have remained comparatively low. And behind the state's closed border, many businesses were riding high. Inside Mike Bonomelli’s sheet metal business, Melbon, staff have been kept busy by a 30 per cent increase in business. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog With the iron ore price high and interest rates low amid a strong economy, Mr Bonomelli took on 10 new staff during the pandemic. ""If you’re asking from a personal level, our company’s enjoyed good times and our staff have enjoyed lots of overtime.” The government's asset write-offs also allowed him to refit his factory with new equipment worth $3 million. Foreseeing a labour force issue, Mr Bonomelli approached the Perth Karen community and took on five new apprentices and 10 new staff in total. But labour is still an issue. “I think we’ve had an ad running three months now and we haven’t had one person,” he said. “I really need the government to have some incentive to fast forward international people coming here on some sort of visa, and cutting the red tape to bring in the trades that we need.” Mr Bonomelli said the last two years have demonstrated the benefits a strong economy and swift decision-making can bring. And looking ahead to the federal election, he wants more of that. Not all people in WA have reaped the rewards of WA’s hard border. For Jen Bird and James Weeding, who operate the family-owned 4WD tourism company Kimberley Wild, it has been brutal. The business helps to showcase sights including Broome, the Bungle Bungles and Motchell Plateau. Ninety per cent of their visitors come from outside WA. “We’ve been very lucky in WA from a day-to-day life point of view we’ve been COVID-free,” said Ms Bird. “However, with a business that depends so much on interstate and international travel, it’s been tough.” They are finally gearing up for a dry season without border interruptions, but it is not all behind them. “With COVID it’s created its own challenges outside of the medical side of it, with the way the labour force has changed, with the way inflation is moving for us,” Mr Weeding said. “And as a seasonal business, we do employ a lot of backpackers, and I think that will be a big challenge this year.” Mr Weeding said they wanted the government to help address labour force issues, and provide long-term support for tourism as they try to navigate out of the last two years. “I would like to see, personally, from the federal government with tourism, perhaps some policies and ideas that stretch beyond a three-year term,” Mr Weeding said. “And the things that affect tourism, like climate and the environment,” Ms Bird said. But they are also ready to move on from COVID, just like Adelaide hairdresser Ali Lucia. As restrictions ease across South Australia, the immediate impacts of COVID are becoming less of a worry for Ms Lucia. She said she was glad to see the end of close contact rules, as they had affected not only her clients but herself too. ""Sometimes you will get a message, you know, an hour before a client's meant to rock up saying I've just been informed I'm a close contact, I have to reschedule,"" she said. But she considers herself one of the lucky ones, keeping her job and now taking on her first mortgage for a brand new home. With that her focus, she said she was now ready to move past the pandemic, and it would not be a big factor in how she votes. “I think there’s a lot of other issues to be dealt with,” she said. “And COVID is just something that we have to get on with.” How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

247,"A Brisbane family who had two loved ones die during Queensland's COVID-19 peak, say tragedies were preventable",health,"  At the peak of Queensland's COVID-19 crisis in late January, Bethania couple Caroline and David Ingerson had to make a heartbreaking choice. Should they say a final goodbye to their dying father in a COVID ward and risk contracting the virus; or stay away from him, so they could remain by the bedside of their seriously ill daughter for her final days? They chose the latter. Eighty-nine-year-old Keith Briese, Toowoomba born and bred, and a former resident of aged care facility Jeta Gardens, died in Ward 2G of the Logan Hospital on January 29. At the same time, his daughter Caroline and son-in-law David were in Ward 2H, making palliative care arrangements for their 18-year-old daughter, Tara. She died at home less than three weeks later. ""I don't think I've had a chance to grieve for my father yet, because I'm so consumed with my daughter,"" Ms Ingerson said through tears. ""He was basically just down the hallway — so close. But I just couldn't. The only saving grace was that my sister could be with him."" The Ingersons' world has felt very empty since the loss of their daughter and father. Their lives were so consumed by caring for Tara, that even a recent getaway — their first in years — caused guilt and grief. ""It's been difficult. It's been very empty,"" Ms Ingerson said. ""The hardest thing I've ever had to do is let Tara go. We've never done respite, because she was a pleasure to look after."" Sympathy cards, photos of Tara and her brother Mark, 28, as well as Tara's recently acquired graduation medal adorn the top of a sideboard. A teardrop-shaped urn containing the teenager's ashes is decorated with her favourite things — purple butterflies. It sits pride of place among the fairyland of tiny ornaments and decorations that Tara collected and curated for years in a glass cabinet just inside the front door. While 2022 will forever be marred by personal tragedy, the Ingersons will also remember it as the year their faith in the aged care and health systems was shattered. Under the pressure of COVID, they watched both systems crumble before their eyes. ""When the government said, 'Oh, they are coping', they weren't. When you were there and seeing on a day-to-day basis what was happening in the hospitals, they were not coping — they were drowning,"" Ms Ingerson said. ""They [medical staff] were doing the best they could, but the reality was, they weren't winning,"" Mr Ingerson added. ""When it came to Tara's situation, I think we saw a system that was completely broken at all levels. ""We saw a number of staff that were working absolutely crazy hours, doing absolutely the best they could, but with a system that was heavily broken, there was going to be no fix."" The couple said chronic staff shortages, coupled with an increase in demand for care was a recipe for disaster. They said they saw many contract nurses trying to work in areas and facilities they had never been in before. ""There were going to be a lot of casualties from that — I believe Tara was one of them,"" Mr Ingerson said. Tara, the strong-willed and mischievous captain of Beenleigh Special School in 2021, was born without a corpus callosum — the band of nerve fibres connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. But it was the degenerative neurological disorder demyelinating polyneuropathy, diagnosed in 2019, that was her biggest battle. ""It was like watching someone lose control of their muscles and everything. It would just creep up from the toes and was moving upwards all the time,"" Mr Ingerson said. By the end of last year, Tara had lost control of using a walker and her bowels were not functioning as they should. ""She was always smiling and happy. She hardly ever cried. You knew something was really wrong if she cried,"" Ms Ingerson said. Until they enlisted a young nurse as a companion and carer for Tara, the Ingersons were trying to manage around-the-clock care for their daughter on their own. ""Caroline would work through from the early morning through the day and then in the evenings, I'd take over the shifts. We had medicines that were running all the time,"" he said. Tara's condition deteriorated rapidly in January but the Ingersons believe their daughter may have lived longer had she received timely surgery. Instead, meetings with a surgical team that were scheduled for December were postponed when one specialist contracted COVID. ""She was due to have surgery but that kept getting put off due to COVID, then when we finally got that appointment they said, 'Look I don't think that surgery we were planning is suitable for Tara anymore — we have to rethink everything',"" Ms Ingerson said. By early January, scores of COVID patients were being treated in hospitals, while hundreds of people were queuing for hours at testing facilities. So far, 868 people have died of COVID in Queensland. It was in the midst of this crisis that the Ingersons desperately needed robust and reliable health and aged care systems. In early January, they had to wait with ambulance crews in the car park of the Mater Hospital from midnight to 3:30am before Tara, who was gravely ill, could be admitted. Tara was having trouble breathing and her resting heart rate had spiked to 140 beats per minute. Blood tests and a COVID swab were taken as she lay on an ambulance stretcher. ""She was in pain, which was the hardest thing for us to take. We just wanted her pain to stop basically,"" Ms Ingerson said. Once inside the Mater, the Ingersons said staff were keen to send them home as there was a great concern Tara would contract COVID. After taking new medication home, they said they were back in an ambulance 24 hours later and this time, taken to the Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospital (QEII) in Coopers Plains because both the Mater and Logan hospitals were full. Mrs Ingerson said she wore PPE so she could monitor her daughter as nursing staff were so busy, but a new problem soon emerged. Tara, who had turned 18 just months earlier in September and was small for her age, was now stuck in limbo between child and adult health services. ""She was in an adult ward but they couldn't look after her because she needed paediatric-sized things,"" Mr Ingerson said. Queensland Health maintains paediatric care is available at all of its hospitals. After returning home again, the Ingersons said a team of doctors at Logan Hospital who had previously looked after Tara, reached out and arranged a bed for her immediately after being shocked by her condition during a telehealth appointment. ""We're pretty sure a couple of the doctors went out on a limb and certainly caused some trouble to get things pushed forward and happen because they were so concerned that things were taking so long to happen,"" Mr Ingerson said. It was during Tara's stay at Logan Hospital the family realised they had to prepare to say goodbye much sooner than they expected. ""I knew time was precious but … I thought we had more time. It came on very quickly,"" Ms Ingerson recalled. Queensland Health was unable to comment on Tara's case or her quality of care but issued a statement describing the loss of life as ""tragic"", offering condolences to families, and reminding Queenslanders they receive ""world-class, free, public healthcare — despite increasing demand"". ""The increase in demand for hospital care is being felt by all jurisdictions and countries around the world,"" a spokesperson said. ""Throughout the pandemic, all jurisdictions have taken responsible measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 among hospital staff and patients. ""This includes furloughing of staff, as a staff member with COVID-19 poses a health risk to patients, particularly those who are immunocompromised."" The spokesperson said all Queensland hospitals had plans to manage the impact of COVID including ""prioritising urgent care, postponing non-urgent elective surgery, increasing the use of Telehealth, and delivering care in other settings"". As the couple started making plans to bring their daughter home for the last time, Ms Ingerson believed her father Keith Briese to be healthy, spending much of his days in bed in the dementia wing of Bethania's Jeta Gardens facility. Mr Briese had a slowly progressing dementia, after being diagnosed 20 years earlier. ""He still knew who we were, but he was a lot sleepier than he used to be,"" Ms Ingerson said. ""He always had this thing ... he wanted to be in his 90s and he was going to do everything he possibly could to get there."" Ms Ingerson said her father was also believed to have another underlying condition, possibly cancer, which he refused to be tested for. As far as she knew, he was fully vaccinated. ""We signed the forms. We know that he definitely got one, but with all of the lockdowns and things we just made the assumption about the other. He hadn't had the booster, of course,"" she said. Ms Ingerson last saw her father on January 2, before the facility imposed a COVID lockdown. Although she was still in touch by phone. The family had previously been happy with the care offered by the facility as both of Mr Ingerson's parents had lived out their days there. ""We sort of noticed things being not so good at the end of last year when the lockdowns were starting, because you weren't allowed to be there and when you were, you weren't allowed to be there for long — so you weren't actually seeing what you were seeing before,"" Ms Ingerson said. ""I didn't know the staff anymore — all that sort of thing."" In late January, Ms Ingerson got a call from staff at Jeta Gardens saying they had called an ambulance for her father. ""I said — 'What's happened?' They said his oxygen is quite low so we're going to get some more oxygen into him,"" Ms Ingerson said. ""They didn't tell me he had COVID at first. It wasn't until I said, why does he need oxygen? Then it was, 'Sorry, did no-one tell you your dad has got COVID?' and I said, 'No'."" Ms Ingerson said she knew there had been a COVID outbreak at the centre, but believed it was isolated to another building. ""The notifications we got from them were very general and with very little information. You'd get a full page come through but it really didn't say anything. It was so vague on everything,"" Mr Ingerson said. Mr Briese managed to recover from that episode without having to go to hospital, but a couple of days later, there was another urgent phone call from Jeta Gardens. ""They said, 'Your dad is not well again. We've called an ambulance but we're just warning you now, he won't come back, he's that ill',"" Ms Ingerson said. Mr Briese died the following morning. More than 90 residents and 80 staff at Jeta Gardens were infected with COVID in early 2022. Sixteen people died. In a statement, a spokesperson for the centre said the Jeta Gardens community had ""experienced and learned a lot to date"" and that it was still ""in the process of recovering from the COVID outbreak and recent flood event,"" but was ""happy and healthy"" once again. The centre confirmed COVID had caused staff shortages earlier this year, forcing some workers to attend extra shifts, do double shifts or stay in ""on-site accommodation to ensure residents continued to be cared for"". A Jeta Gardens spokesperson also confirmed changes were taking place within the centre, including staff training and preparedness planning. The Ingersons are trying to come to terms with their horrific start to the year, they are glad that their daughter Tara could have a final wish granted in the last days of her life. She loved the music from the movie Frozen and wanted to see the stage production that was beginning at QPAC. While her palliative care team warned against it, her parents felt they had nothing to lose. ""When we told her about it in the hospital, she nodded,"" Ms Ingerson said. Then, two days before the performance, with her health rapidly failing, Tara was again asked whether she still wanted to go to the show. ""She had her eyes open then and she blinked. One blink for yes,"" Ms Ingerson said. On the way in, Ms Ingerson had to hold her daughter's head up as her vital signs crashed. Mr Ingerson cried as he remembered how Tara's nurse had to do manual compressions to keep her breathing. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. The team at QPAC had arranged ushers who were paramedics and a room nearby should they need it — but they did not. ""We thought if we got 10 minutes we would be happy, but no, she made it through the whole thing,"" Ms Ingerson said. ""The strength she got from that. The whole way home, there was no need for any intervention at all."" Tara even managed to open her eyes for her favourite song, Let It Go. The next night, Valentine's Day, Tara's condition plummeted and loved ones gathered to say goodbye. Four days later, Tara finally let go too.

248,"Ksenia Borodin needs to survive the 'next two years' until she gets a heart-lung transplant, doctors say",health,"  Young cardiac patient Ksenia Borodin embraces her life while she hopes for a heart-lung transplant On bad days, Ksenia Borodin gets exhausted just getting out of bed and walking the few metres to her kitchen. She avoids stairs as much as she can and sometimes even talking leaves her breathless. At just 22, doctors have told her a heart and double-lung transplant is her only option for long-term survival. But the part-time Brisbane law student, who was born with complex heart problems, says she has never felt like giving up amid a lifetime of ""near-death experiences"". ""I just kind of go along with my day,"" she said. ""I just think, if it's meant to be, it'll be, and, if I'm going to go, I'll go — none of us makes it out of here alive. ""We all have to deal with our own mortality at some point and I've just had to deal with it at a young age — in a way, I'm lucky to be able to accept that because I think a lot of people are terrified [by] it."" Mater cardiologist Mugur Nicolae said Ms Borodin was born with a large hole in the centre of her heart and problems with the valves that control blood flow — a condition known medically as a complete atrioventricular canal defect. ""Instead of having a four-chamber heart, she essentially has a two-chamber heart,"" Dr Nicolae said. The condition results in extra blood flow to the lungs, forcing the heart and lungs to work harder than usual. As a 19-month-old baby, Ms Borodin had surgery to place a band around her pulmonary artery, diminishing the blood flow to her lungs. ""The band is still there and, unfortunately, she's outgrown the band,"" Dr Nicolae said. ""That band has become so tight now that it's causing severe narrowing of the pulmonary artery."" At the same time, her heart has enlarged and she experiences frequent abnormal heart rhythms. ""She's breathless all the time. Her lung function is very poor,"" Dr Nicolae said. ""We are left with only the hope that she can have a heart and lung transplant."" Not all patients are deemed suitable for a transplant, but after rigorous assessments at the Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane — home of Queensland's only heart-lung transplant centre — Dr Nicolae is hopeful Ms Borodin will be placed on the waiting list for donor organs some time this year. Because of her petite size and her O-negative blood type — only found in about 9 per cent of the population — she may have to wait up to two years for a suitable match. ""Hopefully, we'll be able to get her through this next two years until she gets her transplant,"" Dr Nicolae said. But there are no guarantees. Earlier this year, Ms Borodin was admitted to the Mater Private Hospital's intensive care unit, with her heart specialist admitting he feared for her life. ""A couple of times were dicey times — she was very, very sick,"" Dr Nicolae said. Until she receives the call that matching donor organs have been found, Ms Borodin has a lot to live for. Her older sister, Rebecca, is due to give birth in August and she is excited to meet her niece or nephew. She has tickets to a Yungblud concert in July and is hopeful of catching up with the British singer again after meeting him when he was last in Brisbane in 2019. ""I've been to a lot of concerts and any time one of my favourite artists is coming, I'm always like: 'I'm going to buy tickets. I could be dead tomorrow',"" she said. ""I just live my life as if there's no tomorrow. Just make the most of every single moment. I think in some ways, it's the best way to live and go about things."" Long-term, the part-time worker at a Brisbane law firm hopes to finish her law degree. She is also passionate about fighting for the rights of people with invisible disabilities after being verbally abused herself when parking in disabled car spaces. ""I have a disability pass and I genuinely have disabilities,"" she said. ""I will park in a disabled spot … and just get verbally assaulted. ""People will be like, 'You're not even disabled, you can't park there.' I'll try to explain things to them and I just get scoffed at. ""That's really difficult and I feel like there's a lot of ignorance around it. ""I'm kind of, I guess, wanting to talk about it a bit more because I feel like I have nothing to lose now."" Her message to people when they see someone who is not in a wheelchair using a disabled car space or a disabled toilet is: ""Don't assume."" ""Only 4.4 per cent of people with a disability are actually in a wheelchair,"" she said. ""It really frustrates me when I hear the type of discrimination thrown around to people who don't look sick or disabled."" As a teenager who was bullied at school, Ms Borodin tried to conceal her illness behind makeup, using lipstick and nail polish to mask the deep blue of her lips and blue finger nails caused by much-lower-than-normal oxygen levels in her blood. These days, she only occasionally wears lipstick, no longer wishing to cover up evidence of her heart disease. But people will often compliment her on the colour of her lips, without realising it's a sign of ill health. ""People are like, 'I love your lipstick, which one are you wearing?'"" she said. ""I'm like, 'It's natural. I'm sorry I can't give you an exact colour.'"" Ms Borodin is one of about 650 people cared for by the Mater's Congenital Cardiology Service. The number is growing as more children with heart defects survive into adulthood. Dr Nicolae described young adults with cardiac defects as a ""forgotten"" group, with the focus usually on much older heart-attack patients. ""There are at least 60-70,000 adult congenital heart disease patients in Australia and they require long-term care and follow-up with specialist cardiologists, nurses, psychologists and surgeons,"" he said. Mater cardiology clinical nurse consultant Wendy Senior said young people with congenital heart problems faced issues most others their age would never have to confront, such as whether they would ever have children. ""That's a very tricky thing to navigate sometimes for them,"" Ms Senior said. ""They expect that we will be able to assist them and keep them safe and keep their babies safe. ""I'm sure that question comes up for Ksenia as well. It's probably not feasible at the moment, but looking into the future, we would love to be able to support her if that's what she wants."" For now, Dr Nicolae has ruled that out. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""She's been asking me repeatedly if she can have kids,"" he said. ""I've said, 'No, it's going to be exceedingly high risk for you.' ""Obviously, that's distressing to tell that to a young girl but, with a heart and lung transplant, potentially, that's a possibility."" Whatever happens moving forward, even the chance of having a heart-lung transplant has given Ms Borodin a priceless gift. ""At least now there's a little bit of hope,"" Ms Borodin said.

249,'I've never been able to stop': Rod's been using heroin for 38 years. This is what he wants you to know about addiction ,health,"  Rod's been using heroin for 38 years. This is what he wants you to know about drug addiction When Rod was homeless, he needed to find places he could inject heroin without being seen. That's how he ended up overdosing in the bathroom at the Victoria Park train station. He said he would have died if it had not been for the person who happened to be in the stall next to him who called an ambulance. After 38 years of using heroin in a country with a criminalised approach to illegal drugs, Rod — which is not his real name — said stigma and incarceration were endangering lives. ""I don't think it's helpful for people that are using drugs to feel like you have to do it in the shadows or in the margins,"" he said. Drug decriminalisation is a controversial topic in Victoria, where non-medical marijuana remains criminalised, unlike in South Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory. Addiction specialists argue decriminalisation allows drugs to be used more safely and saves lives — and has in countries that have done it like Portugal — while opponents say it would encourage drug use. Rod started using when he was 17 and living in an abusive household. He grew up in a working class part of Melbourne's northern suburbs, where he said young people turned to drugs because there was not much else to do. ""I started using because my friends started using,"" he said. ""My friends meant everything to me, and so I found solace in that sort of camaraderie."" He's now in his 50s, and his addiction has become something to manage. ""The truth is,"" he said, ""I've never been able to stop"". Rod spoke to the ABC on the condition of anonymity because of the stigma surrounding illegal drug use. ""It's a very isolating and lonely place,"" he said. ""There's a lot of shame attached to being a drug user."" Rod said places where he scores drugs are heavily policed, which has resulted in him being arrested for possession. ""I've never been to prison, per se, but I've spent a lot of time in the cell,"" he said. Being in the cell usually lasts a few hours, he said, which leads to painful withdrawals. ""Withdrawal is one of the most abhorrent feelings that you'll ever experience — you're physically ill, and that happens in the cell,"" he said. ""The police don't take you to a detox or to a doctor that can prescribe your pharmacotherapy — you're released back onto the street. ""They don't see you as someone that has had their own life, their own history."" ""In essence, decriminalisation refers to a reduction of legal penalties. This can be done either by changing them to civil penalties, such as fines, or by diverting drug use offenders away from a criminal conviction and into education or treatment options (also known as 'diversion'). ""Decriminalisation largely applies to drug use and possession offences, not to the sale or supply of drugs."" — Alison Ritter, director of the Drug Policy Modelling Program at the University of New South Wales Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Tony Langdon said the police's focus was on arresting and prosecuting drug dealers, while connecting those suffering from addiction to support services. ""As part of Victoria Police's 2020-2025 Drug Strategy, where appropriate police will look to divert and refer people who need help into appropriate services, while also continuing to trial different ways of supporting programs and services which are effective in reducing the harmful effects of drugs and related problems,"" he said. ""This includes supporting public education and awareness around the impact of drug use, using early referral processes, increasing police discretion for diversion, and encouraging the use of treatment services."" Greg Denham is a former Victoria Police senior sergeant turned alcohol and other drug (AOD) worker at cohealth who does outreach with drug users in Melbourne's western suburbs. ""We are a service that they can trust, where they know they're going to not be judged,"" he said. He said the police usually have good intentions around dealing with drug users, ""but it's so far removed from their lives"". ""The people on the street injecting who are part of the drug scene obviously see the police as the enemy."" Unintentional overdoses claimed the lives of 30 Tasmanians in 2017, and once again the leading cause was opioids. So why are so few Tasmanians accessing reversing agent naloxone? Mr Denham said many people he deals with turn to drugs because of trauma and mental health issues, which is exacerbated by the police response. ""They're picked up for a minor offence of drug use and that reinforces and traumatises them,"" he said. He said overdose is common, so he and other AOD workers carry naloxone — a drug that can temporarily reverse an opioid overdose — to administer before the ambulance arrives. ""We also encourage people to go and get the naloxone themselves, so they carry it on them,"" he said. ""We would like officers to carry naloxone, like they do in Western Australia."" Dan Lubman, executive clinical director of addiction treatment and research centre Turning Point, said Australia needs to have an ""honest conversation"" about drug criminalisation. ""The war on drugs has been one of the most catastrophic policy failures in history, in terms of the impact that it's had,"" he said. ""Despite putting billions of dollars into this, we've seen an extended drug market and more dangerous drug supply controlled by organised crime."" A major Australian study which Professor Lubman contributed to found alcohol was the most harmful drug in the country, when considering the harms to both the user and others. ""Yet it's something that the community sees not as a harmful drug but as something to be enjoyed and celebrated,"" he said. ""We have this arbitrary legal definition of what is good drug and what is bad drug."" He supports drug decriminalisation, which he said means removing criminal penalties for people found in possession of drugs. ""We already have sort of de facto decriminalisation through drug diversion programs which operate in every state and territory,"" Professor Lubman said. This involves diverting people found in possession of drugs to education programs, rather than handing them a criminal charge. However, he said the caution and diversion system in its current form is not working, as the decision is at police discretion. A report by the Victorian parliament found Victoria Police's overall use of cautions, as opposed to charges, has declined over the past decade. It found young Aboriginal people and young people in low socio-economic groups were less likely to receive a caution. Assistant Commissioner Langdon said Victoria Police instituted a policy in July last year giving its officers greater powers to issue cautions for drug possession. ""These changes will play a key role in diverting children and adults away from the criminal justice system, thus reducing their likelihood of future criminal involvement,"" he said. ""Police will still take appropriate criminal action when required."" In February, Reason MP Fiona Patten tried to push a bill through Victoria's parliament to end drug criminalisation. Though it was not supported by either major party, she did manage to get the government to agree to consider a localised trial that she described as ""effectively decriminalisation"". A government spokesperson said there were no plans to decriminalise drugs in Victoria. The details of the trial have gone to a working group to be decided, but Ms Patten hopes it will involve Victoria Police automatically diverting people found with small amounts of drugs to education and treatment. ""The harm for everyone relating to drug use in countries where decriminalisation has been in place for a significant period of time is greatly reduced,"" she said. State opposition leader Matthew Guy said Victoria has ""bigger problems"" than drug criminalisation. ""The concept around decriminalisation or even the possession of illicit drugs, I believe, sends the wrong message at the wrong time,"" he said. ""As a parent, I couldn't think of anything worse than sending a message from state parliament that decriminalisation of drugs such as ice is on the agenda."" Speaking in February about Fiona Patten's bill, Police Association of Victoria secretary Wayne Gatt said the government should carefully consider the messaging and impacts of any proposal to decriminalise drugs. ""Messaging is really important when it comes to drug use, because drug use causes harm in our community,"" he said. ""Any sort of decision making in this space would have to have regard to things like road trauma, would have to have regard to community safety and violence on our streets, things like family violence in our homes, and places where we don't necessarily see the impact of drug use."" He also said Victoria needed to invest in more drug treatment facilities. In 2018, the state government opened a trial safe injecting room in Richmond after a spate of heroin-related deaths. A review found it recorded 119,223 visits in its first eighteen months of operation and saved 21 lives. A second centre is in the works for the CBD, but Ms Patten said the process has been bogged down by ""politics"". ""There's a lot of people who would rather these people were not treated as human beings,"" she said. Addiction specialists say the facilities save lives, while the state opposition and some nearby residents have raised concerns about incidents they believe are linked to the Richmond injecting room. Paul MacCartney, a GP at cohealth in Fitzroy, is one of the only doctors in Victoria licensed to prescribe injectable buprenorphine, a drug that can reduce a patient's dependence on opioids for up to a month with each injection. ""For some people, it's been fantastic. It's really been quite freeing and revolutionary for them in really changing the way substance use is impacting them,"" he said. Despite this, he said patients face barriers in accessing opioid replacement therapy. ""There's a real shortage of doctors in Victoria who are willing to prescribe the appropriate treatments for people who have become dependent on opioids,"" he said. ""It could be argued that the medical profession actually kind of abdicated its responsibility."" Dr MacCartney said the disadvantage of GPs shying away from treating addiction is that patients have to go to clinics known for specialising in substance use, which can be prohibitive. The alternative is sticking with illicit drugs. He said his facility does not charge for buprenorphine, but many pharmacists do. Rod said drug criminalisation contributed to his struggle to get secure housing and work over the years. ""When you're an addict, it dominates your whole life,"" he said. It took him eight years to complete, but he now has an arts degree, works four days a week and lives in public housing. ""I spent 20 years trying to make my way,"" he said. ""It was a really long struggle."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

250,Depp v Heard: How a forensic psychologist might diagnose someone they're not treating,health,"  How a forensic psychologist might diagnose someone they're not treating A clinical and forensic psychologist hired by actor Johnny Depp's legal team diagnosed his ex-wife Amber Heard with borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder in court proceedings this week. Dr Shannon Curry also testified at the Fairfax County Circuit Court that, in her professional opinion, she does not believe that Ms Heard suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Mr Depp, 58, is suing Ms Heard, 36, for libel over an opinion piece she wrote in the Washington Post that doesn't name him but in which she referred to herself as a ""public figure representing domestic abuse"". He is seeking a payout of $US50 million ($70 million) for damage to his reputation. Ms Heard is countersuing for $US100 million, alleging Mr Depp smeared her by calling her a liar. Mr Depp has testified that he's the one who was a victim of domestic violence in their relationship. Dr Curry told the court that borderline personality disorder is a disorder of contradictions, where someone can come across as being very charming. But, she said, it's also a disorder of instability, driven by an underlying terror of abandonment. ""When somebody is afraid of being abandoned by their partner — or by anybody else in their environment — and they have this disorder, they'll make desperate attempts to prevent that from happening,"" she said. She said those desperate attempts could involve physical aggression. ""Over time, the anger, the explosive anger that they show when somebody is needing space or when somebody's really not doing anything wrong – because a lot of times they read into things that they perceive as being a slight to them or being somebody intending to harm them that actually isn't happening – they'll exaggerate it and they'll explode, they'll react in this heightened manner that is just exhausting for their partners,"" she explained in court. Dr Curry also said borderline personality disorder could be a predictive factor for women who implement violence against their partners, and a common tactic might be physically assaulting that partner and then getting harmed themselves. She said that people with borderline personality disorder can go from one extreme to another in how they see their partners. ""That person goes from being idealised — the perfect person — to dumpster."" Dr Curry described histrionic personality disorder as belonging to the same cluster of mental illnesses. ""With histrionic personality disorder, what you're going to see is extreme discomfort with not being the centre of attention, extreme efforts to be the centre of attention and when they feel that they're not the centre of attention, you will see some strange things — making up stories to try to get attention, often taking on a victim or princess role,"" she explained. Dr Curry told the court Ms Heard does not have PTSD. ""There were also pretty significant indications that she was grossly exaggerating symptoms of PTSD when asked about them,"" Dr Curry said. ""She initially said, 'Yes, I have that', to 19 of the 20 symptoms. ""That's not typical, even of somebody with the most-disabling form of PTSD. ""When we eventually sort of dialled it down, she had three remaining symptoms."" She said that, according to the notes she reviewed, some of these symptoms were present before Ms Heard started dating Mr Depp. Dr Curry said she reached her diagnoses after reviewing Ms Heard's treatment records and spending 12 hours with Ms Heard, during which she carried out diagnostic testing. She said she was not asked to provide a psychological evaluation of Mr Depp. Dr Lenore Walker is a clinical and forensic psychologist based in Florida. She spoke to the ABC about the work she does generally and how forensic psychology works within the court system in the United States, but did not speak specifically about the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case. On many occasions, Dr Walker — who coined the term ""battered woman syndrome"" — has interviewed people involved in court cases to provide diagnoses. On some occasions, she'll be hired by an attorney and, in other cases, by the court. She said that, particularly in the early days, she might have spent up to two days interviewing someone. ""I would not make a diagnosis unless I actually spent time with the person,"" she said. In coming up with a diagnosis, Dr Walker reviews a variety of documents — such as prior medical history, school records if dealing with children, how someone functions on their job if they have a head injury, police records — and she might interview witnesses as well to get a clearer picture. She's had some high-profile clients. Dr Walker was a forensic consultant in the 1995 OJ Simpson trial, saying it was the first time she can recall an entire trial being televised, minute by minute, from start to finish. ""I also did evaluate OJ for the attorneys at that time, and was prepared to testify, but they never called me because the whole issue of domestic violence began to unravel, I guess, for the prosecution,"" she explained. Dr Walker said that, sometimes, justice was not served well in high-profile cases when people rushed to take one side or the other. ""We have to be very careful in these kinds of cases — when there's high publicity — that we don't jump to conclusions before we hear all sides of the story,"" she said. Dr Stephen Diamond is a clinical and forensic psychologist based in Los Angeles and has testified in court many times, in both civil and criminal cases. He said that defendants, legally and ethically, have the right to refuse diagnostic testing unless there's a court order compelling them to do so. Dr Diamond said that evaluations were often kept separate from treatment to ensure objectivity. ""When you're treating a patient, you have a therapeutic relationship with them,"" he said, ""and that can bias your evaluation."" Dr Diamond stressed to the ABC that he had no involvement in the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard case and was only commenting generally. He said patients sometimes gravitated towards the concept of PTSD, but there are very specific kinds of diagnostic criteria for a PTSD diagnosis to be given. ""Technically speaking, and clinically speaking, PTSD should really only be used as a diagnosis when there has been a threat to one's life as part of the trauma, or one has witnessed someone be murdered or killed or tortured or something like that,"" Dr Diamond said. He said that providing diagnoses was not an exact science. ""A diagnosis is really just an opinion,"" Dr Diamond said. ""Because you can have five different psychologists and psychiatrists evaluate the same patient, and they may come up with five different diagnoses."" Under questioning from Ms Heard's attorney, Dr Curry told the court she was interviewed over dinner at Mr Depp's home by his legal team before she was hired. Mr Depp was present. ""And the dinner lasted approximately three to four hours, correct?"" Ms Heard's attorney, Elaine Bredehoft, asked. ""Yes – the interview,"" Dr Curry replied. ""And it included drinks, correct?"" Ms Bredehoft asked. ""Yes, dinner and I believe drinks were served,"" Dr Curry replied. Dr Diamond said a legal team had the right to interview a prospective expert witness but, he said, doing so over dinner and drinks could potentially lead to a conflict of interest and the bias might not even be conscious. ""I wouldn't be comfortable with it,"" he said, ""and I don't think it's common."" As Dr Curry gave her testimony, Ms Heard could be seen taking notes. Ms Heard is expected to take the stand for the first time as early as Monday, US time.

251,What's happening in our brains when we meditate? It's not just a question for neuroscience,health,"  What's happening in our brains when we meditate? It's not just a question for neuroscience Whether it's prayer, meditation, tai chi, or just chanting, every major religion weaves some form of contemplative practice into its rituals. You don't even have be religious to enjoy the widely acknowledged benefits of contemplation. Meditation is commonplace in the secular world too, as a way to develop insight and transformation by stilling the mind. But what's really going on in our mind when we meditate? And what about when our mind ""wanders"" or when we're suffering from delusion? Could these conscious states have benefits too? The ABC's Religion & Ethics portal is home to reporting on religion, ethical discussion and inspiring stories of faith and belief. These are the kinds of inquiry that Jakob Hohwy is keen to explore at Melbourne's new Centre for Consciousness and Contemplation. He's a professor in the department of philosophy at Monash University, where the centre is based, and the author of The Predictive Mind. Funded by philanthropy, the centre brings together a team of neuroscientists, philosophers, educators, and practitioners to address questions about the nature of consciousness, and how our conscious states change when we engage in contemplative practices like meditation. ""It's a huge investment in this area,"" Dr Hohwy says. ""I think it's bigger than anything else that we've seen so far, at Monash certainly, but also in Australia, as an investment into humanities-oriented research and education."" Philosophers and scientists have grappled for decades trying to decipher exactly what consciousness is. And while many other things have been discovered along the way, we still have no concrete answers about the nature of consciousness — which is why it's become known as the Hard Problem. ""It's the most important thing and it's the most familiar intimate thing. It's so intimate, in fact that it's hard to explain to others sometimes what our conscious state is. ""You have a neuroscientific theory of consciousness, there are a few of those around, and they're quite impressive theories. But they always have this explanatory gap built into them. ""That's why philosophy still has a role to play in trying to figure out what is going on in this domain of inquiry."" But as Dr Hohwy told David Rutledge in a recent episode of The Philosopher's Zone on ABC RN, the centre is not trying to solve the mystery of consciousness. Rather, he says, moving beyond this ""Hard Problem"" opens up some even more interesting questions to ask. ""How are we consciously aware of ourselves? How can we consciously engage in an active way with ourselves and change ourselves? How does consciousness connect to action?"" he asks. ""I think we can answer some of these questions without knowing the ultimate nature of consciousness."" Dr Hohwy says there's value in studying the underlying cognitive processes at play, so we can work with our consciousness to shift our thinking. ""Whenever we have a change in our conscious states, or some kind of transformative experience, whether grief, or through meditation, or taking psychedelics … something must be happening in the brain. ""You can't have a change in your consciousness without at the same time something changing in the brain, in the cognitive processing of information and beliefs that you have."" It's those changes that Dr Hohwy is hopeful can be described by scientific methods and revealed through analysis of experience. While the centre aims to broaden our knowledge of different contemplative practices and mental states, Dr Hohwy is keen to avoid categorising them in a hierarchical way. In psychology and psychiatry, for instance, some conscious states are viewed as normal while others (such as schizophrenia or psychosis) are considered abnormal, and Dr Hohwy wonders if that's counterproductive. ""There's research on psychosis and in particular delusion, where they're looking at whether delusions might have a positive effect on your defence mechanism,"" he says. ""This is not to underplay the hardship of people living with schizophrenia or other kinds of mental illnesses. But the way we stratify conscious states into good and bad … maybe it's time to reconsider some of these things."" Even the way meditation is pitched to us indicates the value we place on some mental states above others. Meditation, we're told, will train our minds to stop wandering so that we focus on what's important. But who's to say that mind wandering is bad in the first place? ""At the moment, people are beginning to say, well, mind wandering might actually not be such a bad thing,"" Dr Hohwy says. ""Maybe there's a reason we mind wander. ""Maybe it's good for us that we mind wander. What are the underlying cognitive processes? What are the health benefits of mind wandering?"" Wisdom is another area of research which Dr Hohwy is keen for the centre to explore. One school of thought might say only the wise — typically men — have wisdom, and it's not something the rest of us can aspire to. ""But once we think of wisdom as a cognitive, psychological construct with deep philosophical roots, we can open it up and make it a bit more accessible,"" Dr Hohwy says. A weekly digest of the best opinion, analysis and reporting on religion and ethics from ABC Radio National. To do that the centre has brought together a diverse team of secular and multi-faith experts from a range of disciplines. ""Cultures across the world and across history have found that there's something special happening when we do some kind of contemplative practice like meditation."" ""But it can't stand alone. It has to be plugged into a theoretical ethical framework that allows you to make sense of what happens when you meditate."" Understanding the changes taking place in the brain will hopefully allow us to integrate them into our daily lives, making us better people, creating a better world. ""I hope the centre will be able to open up some of these discussions without going down some ideological route.""

252,"The IVF worked. But 10 years after the baby was born, this family made a shocking discovery",health,"  How an IVF mix-up went unnoticed for a decade, then changed two families’ lives forever Donna and Vanner Johnson loved watching their boys' unique personalities develop as they grew up. Their eldest son, who is also called Vanner, always loved books. His younger brother, Tim, pushed them away in favour of a soccer ball. Until recently, however, one major difference between the pair was hidden. The Johnsons, who live in Salt Lake City, Utah, had no idea that a mix-up that occurred a decade ago would change two families' lives forever. The Johnsons always wanted several children but struggled to get pregnant after the birth of their first son. They eventually turned to in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). After a couple of rounds, Tim was born in 2008. ""We were overjoyed,"" Donna said. ""He was a beautiful, wonderful baby and child. ""And the boys immediately became fast friends."" Donna was always curious about her family history and, in 2020, the Johnsons took an at-home DNA test to trace their ancestry. When the results came back, the information listed besides Tim's name did not make sense to his parents. ""I saw Donna as his mum and Vanner [Jr] as his half-brother … and it said, 'father unknown',"" Vanner said. ""[The results] hit in a way I didn't expect and it was hard. ""I thought, 'What do you mean, father unknown? I'm his father.'"" Donna immediately suspected something had gone wrong at the University of Utah's Centre for Reproductive Medicine, the IVF clinic where Tim was conceived. ""How did I have a baby with a stranger?"" she asked herself at the time. ""How is that possible? And how would I have not known or had any information that that happened?"" Donna and Vanner kept the secret to themselves for a year, telling only a handful of people including Tim's doctor and a lawyer. The lawyer advised them they were unlikely to face custody issues. Eventually, the Johnsons decided Tim needed to know the truth; Vanner took him out for ice-cream to break the news. It took Tim, who was then 12 years old, a couple of minutes to process the information. ""He said, 'Well, actually, I guess I just kind of wonder what I'd look like with your DNA, Dad. With your genes,'"" Vanner recalled. ""I probably teared up a little bit because my relationship with my son is awesome — it always has been. And, in my mind, I felt like it was going to go the way it went. ""But my fears were that it could go much differently."" Donna and Vanner asked Tim if he wanted to find his biological father and he said he did. He then took another DNA test, through a different online service, which matched him with a woman named as a potential ""close relative"". From there, the Johnsons scoured public records for any information they could find about the woman or her relatives. A family obituary revealed she had a brother, Devin McNeil. An online search of his name led to a blog post he had written with his wife Kelly, which mentioned the couple had gone through IVF at the same clinic, around the same time as the Johnsons. Vanner tracked down a phone number for Devin, who now lives in Colorado, and spent weeks working up the courage to call him. When he first reached out, Devin and Kelly were sceptical and thought they had been targeted by a scam. But after speaking with Vanner, and seeing screenshots of Tim's test results, Devin agreed to take a DNA test, which confirmed the Johnsons' theory. The McNeils also took their own tests to reassure themselves a similar mix-up had not occurred with their other children. ""So now our kids have a half-brother that they never knew, from 12 years ago,"" Devin McNeil said. ""And [the Johnsons] find out that Tim's brother, [who] he'd grown up with, is his half-brother. And his dad's not his biological dad, and he's got [another] biological dad. ""It's crazy to go through it all and really try and digest it."" From the outset, both sets of parents decided they would give Tim the power to decide how much or little he wanted Devin to be involved in his life. When the McNeils told the Johnsons they were planning on visiting extended family in Utah a few months later, Tim said he would like to meet them. Amid awkwardness on both sides, the two families met for a picnic in a local park. ""It was very nerve-wracking to meet strangers and know that they were part of your family,"" Donna said. ""We didn't know what to expect. But the kids just adored each other — they played and had fun."" Tim had a list of questions for Devin: How tall was he when he was Tim's age? Did he ever have braces? Who is his favourite athlete? While those questions were relatively easy to answer, the ones about what happens next are more challenging. ""We've often said there's no manual, no book that someone's given us that says this is how you need to act in this situation, because it's such a unique situation,"" Kelly McNeil said. ""But we just want what's best for him."" Texas woman Eve Wiley felt sad and frustrated when she first heard about the experience of the Johnsons and the McNeils. She has spent years fighting for stronger accountability in the US fertility sector after discovering her mother's doctor was her biological father. Her mother has accused the doctor of using his own sperm without her consent. He denies any wrongdoing. Last year, a Californian couple sued their fertility clinic, alleging a mix-up had resulted in them giving birth to a child who was not biologically theirs. Ms Wiley believes many other cases do not receive public attention, due to both parties involved signing non-disclosure agreements. ""A lot of these things are completely avoidable if we would just put regulations in place that really decrease the chance of human error,"" she said. ""These are people's lives that we are creating and destroying."" The fertility industry in the United States is worth billions of dollars, with tens of thousands of babies born as a result of assisted reproductive technology in the country each year. The sector is regulated by a combination of state and federal agencies, as well as professional, self-regulatory bodies such as the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART). Some experts argue it's a patchwork that leads to poor monitoring, little oversight and a lack of transparency compared to other developed nations. Ms Wiley described it as the ""wild, wild west."" The ABC's investigation into Australia's fertility system uncovered stories of heartbreak, strained relationships, financial hardship, ""miracle babies"" and everything in between. SART president Timothy Hickman disagrees. He says the existing system mostly works well and that mix-up cases are uncommon. ""I would think they're quite infrequent and they're probably due to human error,"" Dr Hickman said. ""These are situations where it sounds like embryos may have been mixed up or something like that. ""Every lab should have a way to avoid that with both the witnessing and verification — it takes multiple steps through every twist and turn of the actual IVF process."" Many labs now use barcodes to identify each petri dish and the patient it belongs to, which Dr Hickman compared to wearing a wristband in hospital prior to surgery. He recommended patients check the certifications of clinics and request as much information from them as possible. ""Saying, 'Hey, have you had any challenges in your lab? If so, what's happened? How, what have you done to correct it?'"" he said. ""I think those are all very fair questions… if the patient is looking at several different clinics and wants to know what the track record is."" The Johnsons and the McNeils are in the early stages of taking legal action against their IVF clinic at the University of Utah. ""We love the miracle IVF is,"" Vanner said. ""IVF gave us something we love very much — and we would never want that taken [away] — but it's also very hard to find out what we found out, in the manner we did. ""Why? How? Who's not paying attention? Because it shouldn't be us to be the ones to have to bring attention to this."" The clinic said it could not comment on cases where there was ongoing litigation but that the safety and care of its patients was its primary goal. ""If patients come to us with questions or concerns about their care, we evaluate our procedures and, if necessary, make changes to ensure the safest, highest quality care is delivered to our patients,"" a spokesperson for the clinic said in a statement. For now, the Johnsons and the McNeils are focused on working together to support Tim as best they can. The path ahead is unclear, but Vanner does not regret tracking down his son's biological father and bringing the two families together. ""Some professional people said, 'You probably don't even want to contact the [biological] father'. [But] I'm glad we did,"" he said. ""We're both open to what's best for the kids: What's best for Tim, what's best for their family and for our son as well, our oldest son. ""We're building that and we're continuing to see it flourish … but we don't know long term what that looks like, just that we're taking it day by day.""

253,'It's an entire health system issue': Fresh data shows the impact of the Omicron wave,health,"  Victoria's beleaguered health system experienced record strain under the weight of the Omicron wave at the start of the year, fresh government data shows. The Victorian Health Services Performance statistics show about one third of urgent code 1 ambulance patients waited more than the target time during the March quarter. The number of call-outs surged during the same period, at a time when record numbers of paramedics were furloughed after being exposed to COVID-19. The pressure was being felt across the state's hospital emergency departments, which treated nearly 2,000 more patients than the previous quarter while battling through staff shortages. ""What these figures tell us is that our hospital system, our ambulance system, continues to be under significant pressure from COVID-19,"" Health Minister Martin Foley said. The figures cover January through to March, when the deadly Omicron wave took hold on the country. ""Whilst for most of us, life is starting to look like something approaching normal… that is certainly not the case when it comes to our hard-working healthcare and paramedic workforce,"" Mr Foley said. ""Not just here in Victoria, but indeed both nationally and indeed globally, our health systems continue to be under huge pressure."" COVID-related hospitalisations peaked at about 1,200 at the height of the Omicron wave, at a time when an average of 5,000 hospital workers and 500 paramedics were furloughed each day. About 1,500 hospital and ambulance workers are now furloughed each day on average. Ambulance Victoria responded to 93,234 code 1 incidents between January and March, a 14.2 per cent increase on a year earlier. Code 1 cases represent urgent ""lights and sirens"" emergencies. Ambulance Victoria Acting CEO Libby Murphy said the surge made the three-month period the ""busiest in Ambulance Victoria's history"". Paramedics responded to 66.8 per cent of those calls within the 15-minute target set by the state. That figure is a slight improvement from the previous quarter, when 66 per cent of patients were met within that window. Diana Schumacher reached out to the emergency services for help. Then she had to treat herself. The increased demand came at a time the state's triple-0 system was already in crisis. A dozen Victorians have died while waiting for an ambulance since October last year and there are two reviews underway into the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA). Mr Foley said the wait times faced by up to a third of code 1 callers was ""because of the demands on the system, be they the high levels of staff being furloughed, because of the arrangements in place when it comes to infection prevention and control, and through the sheer number of cases that they are responding to"". Ambulance Victoria's Ms Murphy said it was responding to the demand through the recruitment of 700 new paramedics in 2021 and another 120 this year. Ambulance Union secretary Danny Hill said the wait times were due to a combination of factors, including COVID-19 restrictions lifting and people calling triple-0 for matters that were not urgent. Ramping at hospitals due to crowded emergency departments remained a ""huge factor"" in delays, he said. ""It's an entire health system issue that we're dealing with,"" he said. ""And any time we have issues in the entire health system, the flow-on effect is that people don't get ambulances in time."" There were 463,000 patients treated in Victorian hospital emergency departments in the March quarter, which Mr Foley said was up by 1,900 on the previous months. For much of that time, a Code Brown declaration was in place across much of the state's hospitals. The declaration allowed for staff leave to be cancelled and elective surgeries to be deferred until after it lifted in mid-February. With wait times for elective surgeries in public hospital systems ballooning, some patients are self-funding their own procedures. About 27,700 elective surgeries were still completed, about 6 per cent less than the previous quarter. But 89,611 Victorians are still on the waitlist for elective surgery, including about 2,700 of the most urgent category 1 patients. That's a dramatic increase on the 65,251 people waiting a year earlier — which was a record at the time. ""Despite the significant pressures that our paramedics and our healthcare workers continued to deliver care to the most seriously unwell in really challenging circumstances,"" Mr Foley said. Glenn McQuade was told in July 2021 that he needed a further surgery for a lifelong degenerative disease affecting his hip. It was considered category two surgery and should have been done in 90 days, but was cancelled in August due to COVID restrictions. ""I was able to walk normally but if I was at work, I wouldn't be able to sustain an eight-hour shift,"" Mr McQuade said. The Royal Melbourne Hospital patient services worker has only just recently had the procedure after taking time off work and being on strong painkillers while waiting an extra eight months for surgery. ""I was disheartened but I understood the situation due to my background in health."" He's now looking forward to taking a trip to the Kimberleys, which has booked for two years. ""The way I'm feeling and subject to getting the surgeon's approval, I would be able to get off the one crutch and be able to walk around independently."" Mr Foley apologised to people waiting for surgery and said the state was working to bring wait times down. The Austin Hospital saw a record number of presentations to its emergency department in March. The health service's chief executive, Adam Horsburgh, said it put immense pressure on the system, which was still being hit by staff shortages. ""So in that context, both the staff at the Austin Health and everyone across the whole system really do deserve our respect and admiration for their ongoing tireless efforts and hard work,"" Mr Horsburgh said. Opposition MP Matthew Bach said the waitlist was ""89,000 too many"". ""So I'd say this: The Andrews Labor government got us into this mess, they're not the right people to get us out of it."" The state government announced a $1.5 billion ""COVID Catch-Up"" package at the start of the month aimed at responding to the ballooning surgery backlog. Since October last year, up to 12 Victorians have died while waiting for an ambulance, as the overwhelmed system continues to be plagued by long delays and staff shortages. Under the plan, the Frankston Private Hospital will be transformed into a public surgery centre with capacity to deliver up to 9,000 public surgeries per year. Meanwhile, $475 million will be invested in the public system to support more same-day surgeries, increase twilight and after-hours work and theatre improvements. The government is setting up eight rapid access hubs across metropolitan public hospitals, which are due to be operational by next year. Mr Foley on Saturday confirmed University Hospital Geelong would be the eighth hub. The government has appointed Royal Melbourne Hospital's director of surgical services, Ben Thomson, as Chief Surgical Adviser to the state as part of the scheme. Mr Foley urged Victorians to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and influenza in a bid to keep the hospital system free for people who needed it most.

254,Athletes push for better access ahead of Commonwealth Games,health,"  Athletes, advocates call for overhaul of regional train services before 2026 Commonwealth Games Disability advocates say work to improve accessibility on Victoria's public transport must start immediately if the system is to be ready for the 2026 Commonwealth Games. Announced in early April, four cities across the state will host events with the MCG to feature the opening ceremony. Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and Gippsland will all play a role in the games with ""satellite events"" in other regional areas expected to be announced. Questions have been raised over the effectiveness of the public transport system and its ability to cope with a high number of visitors, particularly for those living with disabilities. The state government said one third of people in Victoria had a profound or serious disability, and 20 per cent of public transport users were living with a disability. Three-time Paralympian and Commonwealth Games athlete Don Elgin said upgrading accessibility needed to involve a ""consistent, conscious approach"" no matter what events were happening. ""I don't think the disability sector, because of the Commonwealth Games, is all of a sudden going to have a trump card,"" Mr Elgin said. ""Just because the Games are coming to town, doesn't mean it's less of a priority or more of a priority to get accessibility right."" Mr Elgin said the importance of the sporting event was the legacy it left for all members of society. ""The Games are going to come and go; the key is how do we get accessibility right for the bigger picture,"" he said. The state government in February revealed a series of upgrades for the Ballarat train station precinct, including a $28 million transformation of the Goods Shed convention centre. The upgrades received criticism for taking priority over disability access upgrades. Advocates say the train station's primary issue with accessibility is a lack of ramp access from platform one to platform two, where a heritage bridge with steep stairs is the nearest and quickest way to cross sides. It means those who cannot use stairs are forced to use the pedestrian crossing on Lydiard Street, about 100m away from the station. Grampians Disability Advocacy chief executive Deborah Verdon said it should not take a major event such as the Games to get urgent upgrades made. ""Improving access at the Ballarat railway station has always been important,"" Ms Verdon said. ""I suppose … a huge international event like the Commonwealth Games really accentuates the fact that [the transport system] is not fit for purpose if you are going to run a competition. ""It would frankly be embarrassing if the station was still in its current situation when the Games are on."" A review into Australia's public transport system set a December 2022 deadline to have certain minimum requirements for the nation's transportation systems. The Disability Discrimination Act called for train and tram providers to comply with a minimum of 90 per cent of standards for access paths, manoeuvring and passing areas, ramps, doorways and doors, lifts and toilets. The review found that the December 2022 deadline for 100 per cent compliance across Australia was ""unlikely to be met"". Ms Verdon said the ""silence was deafening"" from the state government when it came to upgrades. ""We have tried everything to put our case to the authorities about the poor state of affairs at the Ballarat railway station,"" Ms Verdon said. ""We've had very little of anything meaningful back."" Transport Minister Ben Carroll said the government had been ""looking into"" the upgrades but would not make any substantive announcements on the topic. He said it did not take the announcement of the Games to get the spotlight on the infrastructure upgrades. ""I do fully appreciate and understand in terms of lift access, other amenities that are required … that these are vitally important for the community,"" Mr Carroll said. ""The clock is ticking … we are making investments, but we do have so much more work to do."" ABC Ballarat will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

255,"South Australians welcome removal of COVID-19 close-contact rules, as hospitalisations spike",health," Coronavirus For the first time in two years, South Australians no longer need to isolate for seven days if they're deemed close contacts of a COVID-19 case. The news was announced last week, and brings the state into line with New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The change has been welcomed by many within South Australia's hospitality and retail sectors, which have been hard-hit by closures resulting from staff shortages. The owner of Adelaide restaurant Soi 38, Terry Intarakhamhaeng, described the change in protocol as a ""relief."" """"I have [had] a lot of staff in the past few weeks isolate because of the close contact [rules] and some nights we've had to close early because we don't have enough staff to run,"" he said. Under the changes, close contacts will be allowed to come to work, so long as they notify their employers or education facilities of their close contact status. They'll need to take five rapid antigen tests over a seven-day period after their exposure to the virus, and wear masks at all times when outside the house. They will also be prohibited from visiting high-risk settings, such as hospitals and aged care facilities. Mr Intarakhamhaeng said the rules struck the right balance between keeping the community safe, and businesses running. ""Customer experience is one of our main goals, other than serving great food from our traditional way of cooking,"" he said. ""Keeping the staff happy and keeping everyone with a pocket full of money … that all makes everyone happy. SA has reported 3,907 new cases, about the same as yesterday. But vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Chris Moy, warned the move would result in an increase of COVID-19 infections in the state. ""It's almost certainly the case that we will see some increase in cases,"" he said. ""While we see an increase in convenience, with people not being required to quarantine, so more people can go to work, in theory, we pay a price in terms of increased risk of people going around spreading the infection."" Dr Moy welcomed the state government's decision to delay relaxing the restrictions by a week, compared to the eastern states. ""The key thing you have to see every time you remove restrictions is that cases are going down, and that the hospital system is coping. That seems to be the case at the moment,"" Dr Moy said. ""What we need to see, going forward, is that people continue to get their booster shots, their flu shots, and that we don't see people going to work sick."" The number of patients in SA’s hospitals with the virus has jumped from 222 to 250. 15 people are in ICU, compared to 11 yesterday. Four women aged between their 70s and 90s have died in South Australia after testing positive for COVID-19. Currently, 93.4 per cent of South Australians have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, but just over 65 per cent have had three.
