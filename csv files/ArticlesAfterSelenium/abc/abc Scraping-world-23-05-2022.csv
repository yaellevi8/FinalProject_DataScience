0,"China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, set to make two-week Pacific Islands visit",world,"  China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, arriving for two-week Pacific Islands visit Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi looks set to visit at least five Pacific Islands nations over the coming two weeks in a marathon trip designed to signal Beijing's broader ambitions in the Pacific and strengthen China's commercial and security ties with the region. Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare publicly confirmed the visit from Wang Yi yesterday. In a national address, Mr Sogavare said that his country would ""receive a high-level visit from the government of the People's Republic of China later this week"". The ABC has been told the Foreign Minister will arrive in Solomon Islands late on Wednesday night, and that he will meet with Mr Sogavare and other senior leaders on Thursday. His visit comes just weeks after the two countries agreed to a controversial new security pact, and is a powerful reminder of the strategic challenges which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has to grapple with after taking office on Monday. The Solomon Islands government said yesterday that Mr Wang and ""his almost 20 member delegation"" would spend a day in Honiara ""attending various high level meetings, courtesy calls on the Prime Minister and acting Governor-General, and hosting a press conference alongside his counterpart, Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele"". It said a ""highlight"" of the visit would be ""the signing of a number of key bilateral agreements with the national government"", while praising the trip as a ""milestone"" in the relationship between the two countries. The release did not say if Honiara would host a ceremony to formally sign the security pact already agreed to by both countries, but the agreement has stirred deep unease in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, countries that fear it might open the door to a Chinese military presence in Solomon Islands. Wang Yi is also expected to visit Fiji on Sunday and Monday, and Papua New Guinea next week on June 2 and 3. Diplomatic sources said they believed the Foreign Minister would also travel to other Pacific Islands nations, listing Vanuatu, Samoa, Tonga and Kiribati as possible destinations. The trip is certain to be monitored very closely, both by Canberra and by Washington. Kiribati only re-established diplomatic recognition of China in 2019, but the relationship has rapidly evolved since then. Last year, Opposition MPs in Kiribati fiercely criticised a China-backed plan to upgrade a World War II-era airstrip in the country, suggesting Beijing was eyeing it as a possible military base. The Financial Times also reported on the weekend that China was trying to strike a security agreement with Kiribati and at least one more unnamed Pacific Islands nation, citing US intelligence officials. That report also suggested that those agreements could be similar to the one agreed to by China and Solomon Islands. The government of Kiribati has denied that claim outright, but the country's strategic location — only a few thousand kilometres from the massive US naval base in Hawaii — means US officials are anxious about any prospect of a Chinese presence. One senior Western government official told the ABC on Sunday that it was ""very plausible"" that China was looking to sign security pacts in the Pacific, but wouldn't be drawn on whether the government had any hard intelligence suggesting they were imminent. Dr Graeme Smith from the Australian National University told the ABC that there had been persistent reports in Kiribati that China was seeking a security agreement with the country. He said it was hard to say whether Kiribati would accept such a deal, but Solomon Islands' agreement could have significant ramifications: ""Once there's precedent … it becomes a question of, 'Well, Solomon Islands is still standing and they've signed, if you want the full friendship, why don't you sign on too?'"" Dr Smith said Kiribati, which reinstated ties with Beijing in 2019, was at a similar stage in its diplomatic relationship with China as Solomon Islands. ""At this stage in the relationship, there's a much greater intensity of engagement,"" he said. He also said Kiribati was more strategically important to China than Solomon Islands. For Pacific nations, climate change is not a future event — it's already happening. ""It stretches 3,000 kilometres from East to West. It's fairly close to Hawaii,"" he said. ""And it has a massive exclusive economic zone in terms of the territorial waters."" In Fiji, Wang Yi is likely to meet not just with Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama but also with senior officials at the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in the capital, Suva. One Pacific Islands government source said Wang Yi would also likely hold a virtual meeting with several other Pacific Islands foreign ministers while in the country. Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape confirmed yesterday the Chinese embassy in Port Moresby had advised his government of the Foreign Minister's visit to PNG next week. ""The Foreign Minister is a high minister by raking, in as far as the Chinese Government structure is concerned,"" he said. ""And, so, if he confirms to fly in here, the Papua New Guinean Government will give him all the respect that he deserves, and all the protocols.""

1,WHO says no indication monkeypox has mutated,world,"  No evidence to suggest monkeypox virus has mutated, according to WHO The World Health Organization does not have evidence that the monkeypox virus has mutated, a senior executive at the UN agency said, noting the infectious disease that has been endemic in West and Central Africa has tended not to change. Rosamund Lewis — head of the smallpox secretariat that is part of the WHO's Emergencies Programme — told a briefing that mutations tended to be typically lower with this virus, although genome sequencing of cases will help inform understanding of the current outbreak. More than 100 suspected and confirmed cases in a recent outbreak across Europe and North America have not been severe, said the WHO's emerging diseases and zoonoses lead and technical lead on COVID-19, Maria van Kerkhove. Dr van Kerkhove said that the situation was ""containable"" particularly in Europe. ""But we can't take our eye off the ball with what's happening in Africa, in countries where it's endemic,"" Dr van Kerkhove said. According to the WHO, the outbreaks have been atypical, occurring in countries where the virus does not regularly circulate. Scientists are seeking to understand the origin of the cases and whether anything about the virus has changed. The WHO is asking dermatology and primary healthcare clinics, as well as sexual health clinics, to be alert to potential cases. Many — but not all — of the people who have been diagnosed in the current monkeypox outbreak have been men who have sex with men (MSM). Officials said it was too early to say why, but this demographic may be likely to seek medical advice or have access to sexual health screening. The virus does not usually spread easily between people, but it can be passed through close person-to-person contact or contact with items used by a person who has monkeypox, such as clothing, bedding or utensils. ""We know that MSM, if they do spot an unusual rash, they're likely to want to get it sorted out quite quickly,"" said strategies advisor at the WHO's department of global HIV, hepatitis and STI, Andy Seale. ""The fact they've been proactive in responding to unusual symptoms might be part of the story. This will become clearer in the weeks and days to come."" Dr van Kerkhove said she expected more cases to be identified as surveillance expands. Asked whether the early findings may fuel discrimination, Dr Seale said: ""There are ways we can work with communities to learn from decades of experience around tackling stigma and discrimination with HIV. We want to apply those lessons learned to this experience.""

2,'Fish rot from the head': Russia's failure in Ukraine starts with Putin. Can he end his war?,world,"  Three months into his war in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is holding firm on his plan to restore Russian glory and protect his iron grip on power. To understand why, it pays to understand his past. Things are not going to plan for Vladimir Putin. The once-feared Russian army has long since abandoned its goal of capturing Ukraine's capital Kyiv, and it's been largely beaten back from the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv. Moscow's tactics for its invasion have changed — it is now solely focused on the ground war in the eastern Donbas region, and in the south. In those areas, it has managed to push its lines forward but the gains are incremental, often just a few kilometres at a time. There has been no breakthrough. Many experts classify the fighting now as little more than a standstill, with both sides braced for months of combat ahead. No matter how you look at it, Putin's ""special military operation"" — as he calls it — is far from achieving the goals he spelled out at the beginning of the invasion in his televised address to the nation, and the world, on February 24. ""[The] goal is to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the regime in Kyiv for eight years,"" Putin said. ""And for this, we will pursue the demilitarisation and 'de-nazification' of Ukraine."" As the world has witnessed, rather than laying down its arms, Ukraine's armed forces — and its civilians — have mounted fierce resistance. Three months into the war, estimating the scale of Russian losses is difficult — the Kremlin hasn't released any figures for the past two months. Ukraine claims the current toll is now close to 30,000 Russian soldiers killed. Some Western intelligence sources suggest this number is too high. Yet Britain's Ministry of Defence estimates 50,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded. In a sign the losses are mounting, Russia is now considering scrapping the upper 40-year-old age limit for soldiers. At home, Putin still talks of the ""de-nazification"" of Ukraine, but there's little prospect now of toppling the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy has survived attempts to kill him, and his government remains in Kyiv. His video addresses have rallied Ukrainian support at home and around the world. He's had visits from the White House, Downing Street and the UN — the country even won last week's Eurovision song contest. But Putin is showing no sign of weakening. He has acknowledged there will be pain but, according to the world of Vladimir, Russia will endure. On Victory Day earlier this month, the Russian President told his nation and the world his country had no choice but to act in Ukraine. ""The danger was rising by the day,"" he said in his speech on Red Square. ""Russia has given a pre-emptive response to an aggression — [the] only correct decision by a sovereign, powerful and independent country"". Putin said Russian troops in Ukraine had been fighting for ""the motherland"". ""No-one will forget the lessons of World War II and there will be no place in the world for hangmen, executioners and the Nazis"". As international companies abandon the country, as the last vestiges of independent media disappear, as connections to Europe and the US are cut, Russia is bracing for more self-reliance — an existence largely isolated from the West. It's a future Vladimir Putin is very comfortable with. It's much like the country that moulded his past: The USSR. Amidst stories of Vladimir Putin's enormous personal wealth and power, it's worth remembering his childhood. It was simple, typically Soviet, and there is no doubt it shaped him. His father barely survived World War II and he was born after two older siblings had died. The Putins lived in a shared ""kommunalka"" apartment in Leningrad, now St Petersburg. There was one stove and one toilet, shared by three families. At the height of the Cold War in the sixties, most Soviet kids dreamed of becoming cosmonauts. Not Vladimir Putin. As journalist Masha Gessen writes in her biography of Putin, as a teenager he had a portrait of Yan Berzin, the founder of Soviet military intelligence, on his desk. Putin himself enjoys telling the story of how he tried to join the KGB when he was just 16. They passed then, but he did find his way in after graduating from Leningrad State University. It would be hard to describe his KGB career as stellar. Putin had studied German and his only international assignment was in Germany. In 1985 he was posted not to East Berlin, where, as Masha Gessen points out, he could have actively recruited spies in the West, but instead went to Dresden, an industrial city in the heart of East Germany. He was there when the Berlin Wall fell and the German Democratic Republic began to implode. Putin, his first wife and two daughters returned to Leningrad in 1990 as the Soviet Union itself was falling apart. They moved back into one room in his parent's two-bedroom apartment in Leningrad. But soon, his long climb up the political ladder would begin. In 1990, at the age of 38, Putin became an adviser to the Mayor of St Petersburg and gradually became a power player in the city's administration. Within just a few years, he was suspected of orchestrating a multi-million-dollar kickback scheme but he was never charged. At this time, Putin started to learn some valuable lessons about how politics in the new Russia worked. ""His formative years were spent, essentially, as a deputy mayor in St Petersburg (formerly Leningrad), enriching himself off the backs of people who were going hungry,"" said Sydney-based journalist Zoya Sheftalovich, a contributing editor for Politico Europe. ""There wasn't going to be any accountability as long as you kept people very, very close and as long as you maintained a system of corruption that kept the power at the top."" By 1996, he moved to the Kremlin. His KGB background undoubtedly helped him move up the ranks and by 1998, he was running the FSB, the organisation that had succeeded the KGB after the USSR dissolved. Putin was little known outside of the Kremlin when then-president Boris Yeltsin appointed him prime minister in 1999. He was a compromise candidate, not seen as having much political ambition. But many speculated his background in the security services was a big advantage. Putin could provide stability after a period of economic chaos, as well as protecting the financial gains Yelstin and those around him had made while they were in power. Soon after his appointment, a series of apartment bombings swept Russia. Putin blamed Chechen terrorists, but many have suspected the blasts were actually the work of the FSB. ""All of a sudden, we saw these very mysterious bombings in Moscow apartment buildings that had quite interesting links to the FSB … and all of a sudden we had to blame that on Chechnya,"" Sheftalovich said. Putin talked tough and sent Russian troops to crush Chechnya's capital, Grozny. His popularity soared. Relentless favourable coverage from Russia's state media pushed him to the top of a crowded field in the presidential election in 2000. He easily won that election, receiving 53 per cent of the vote — 23 per cent more than his nearest rival, the leader of the Communist Party. Russia's first post-Soviet leader, Boris Yeltsin, had been widely ridiculed. At times he appeared drunk and out of control in public. In the final years of his presidency, Russia's economy was in chaos. Putin quickly set about building an image as the anti-Yeltsin. Bare-chested hunting trips. Judo competitions. Hardworking and deadly serious. And the Russian public liked the image they were shown. Initially, Putin sought to engage the West. In 2001, he addressed the German Bundestag in fluent German and spoke of Russia's place in Europe. ""I am convinced that today we are turning over a new page in our bilateral relations, thereby making our joint contribution to building a common European home,"" he said at the time. Far from ridicule, Putin inspired fear and respect. In 2009, Australian James Blake was one of the few ""Angliiski"" or non-Russians allowed to be in the main Russia Today newsroom when Putin came to visit. RT, as it's known, is the Kremlin's international news channel. ""There was considerable nervousness in the newsroom,"" said Blake, who was RT's business editor at the time. ""I was amazed when someone spilled a cup of coffee on a patch of carpet not far from where I was sitting, and the entire patch was immediately replaced."" Despite days of preparation, what struck Blake was how brief the visit was; Putin was clearly uncomfortable in this kind of environment. ""He and [RT Editor Margarita Simonyan] spent all of about 90 seconds down at the front of the newsroom standing alongside the desk of one of the translators [then], no sooner was he there than he was gone. ""When I asked one of the Russian journalists I was with what she thought of proceedings she replied: 'He is a short man, but he has an energy.'"" Not long after the war in Ukraine began, so did the questions about Putin's hold on power. There was speculation that powerful elements in the security services and the elites might decide the costs of the war were too high, particularly as Russia's invasion became bogged down and the economy felt the heavy impact of sanctions. Some even predicted Putin would be ousted in a coup. But three months into the war, his control in Moscow seems as strong as ever. On Russian state media every night, audiences are fed hours of coverage portraying a very different picture of the war — one in which Ukraine is the aggressor and its troops are the ones committing war crimes. Despite occasional public displays of opposition, Putin can still count on sizeable public support for the war Behind the scenes, there has been plenty of intrigue as security services scramble to escape the fallout from the disastrous pre-war intelligence provided to the Kremlin. But none of that appears to have threatened Putin's control. A little more than a decade ago, there were real questions about whether or not Vladimir Putin would voluntarily give up power. In 2011, Putin had to decide whether he would again run for president after spending one term as prime minister. Russia's constitution forbids more than two consecutive presidential terms, so in 2008 the Kremlin arranged a switch. Deputy PM Dmitry Medvedev easily won the election as Russia's president and he appointed Putin as his prime minister. I arrived as the ABC's correspondent in Moscow during this time and witnessed this political charade play out. Dmitry Medvedev was Russia's president but everyone knew the real power had simply moved to the prime minister's office. No one doubted Vladimir Putin was still running the country. When Kutuzovsky Prospekt, the main road outside our office window, fell silent, that was the cue that in a few minutes Putin's convey would be speeding down the closed-off eight-lane street into the centre of Moscow. But he wasn't heading to the Kremlin. In the period from 2008-2012, the prime minister's office was in the ""Russian White House"", the Russian Federation Government House on the Moscow River. The real power had followed Putin there. As the decision whether to return to the presidency approached, the Arab Spring revolutions were sweeping the Middle East. The events deeply impacted Putin. ""Seeing the film footage of the Arab Spring was what caused him to essentially take power back because he didn't think he could trust Medvedev to keep his grip on power,"" said Sheftalovich. ""It's quite well known that he saw the mobile phone footage of [Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi] being captured and then tortured and killed. ""Apparently, according to those who were close to him, [he was] horrified by that footage. ""I think he saw that what was happening to Gaddafi could very well happen to him."" Sheftalovich lived in Ukraine until she was seven years old, when it was still part of the USSR. Her family immigrated to Australia in 1992. For her, the fear of an Arab Spring-type revolution in Russia is one of the drivers behind Putin's war in Ukraine. And it's not just NATO, she says, it's that Ukraine was on the path to becoming a successful, democratic country. ""I think for Putin, you don't want an example of a successful democracy right next door speaking your language."" From the Kremlin's viewpoint, if Ukraine could move to the West, so, theoretically, could Russia. And that would mean Putin and his entire power apparatus, all of their wealth and influence, would be dismantled. Sheftalovich believes for those around Putin, there's no turning back. ""These people are not going to care about the lost lives and wanting to stop Putin for any sort of ideological reason,"" she said. ""The only thing they care about is their own skins, and it doesn't look great for them if Putin leaves."" The Kremlin now faces a harsh reality: its military has been out-fought on the ground, and its generals have been out-thought in command. How could the Russian army perform so poorly? ""Fish rot from the head,"" said recently retired Australian Army major general Mick Ryan. ""When you have a bad strategy from the start, you can't fix that."" From the battle for Snake Island to a spate of military general deaths and the devastating loss of a battalion crossing a river, Russia's mistakes on the battlefield have left Vladimir Putin in an embarrassing position. Ryan, now a military strategist, has been following the war closely. He's written about battlefield developments for the ABC and for his more than 200,000 followers on Twitter, his analysis has become required reading. ""Vladimir Putin made three incorrect assumptions: Ukraine is not a real country, Ukraine wouldn't fight, and the West wouldn't intervene,"" Ryan said. ""All three proved wrong."" Wars only end, according to Ryan, when one side is defeated or through negotiation. He tips the latter. There will be some sort of peace deal, ""but not yet"". He said Russia needed to do more to claim some form of victory in Donbas and the south after Ukraine had a taste of success in Kyiv and Kharkiv. ""They're both going to want to duke it out a bit more."" A plausible victory — one that can be sold to the Russian people — is the only way out for Putin and those around him. It seems no amount of civilian deaths or economic hardship will keep them from that goal. Russia flattened Grozny in Chechnya. It unleashed terrible destruction on Aleppo in Syria. It's now doing the same in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has learned the lesson: the best way to protect power is to hang onto it. Even if it takes a war.

3,Ukrainian President Zelenskyy pushes strict Russian sanctions at Davos forum,world,"  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for ""maximum"" sanctions against Russia during a virtual speech to corporate executives, government officials and other elites on the first day of the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos. He said sanctions needed to go further to stop Russia's aggression, including an oil embargo, blocking all of its banks and cutting off trade with Russia completely and that it is a precedent that would work for decades to come. ""This is what sanctions should be: They should be maximum, so that Russia and every other potential aggressor that wants to wage a brutal war against its neighbour would clearly know the immediate consequences of their actions,"" Mr Zelenskyy said through a translator. He also pushed for the complete withdrawal of foreign companies from Russia to prevent supporting its war and said Ukraine needed at least $5 billion in funding per month. ""The amount of work is enormous: we have more than half a trillion dollars in losses, tens of thousands of facilities were destroyed. We need to rebuild entire cities and industries,"" Mr Zelenskyy said, coming days after the G7 countries agreed to provide $19.8 billion in economic aid. He said if Ukraine had ""received 100 per cent of our needs at once, back in February"" in terms of weapons, funding, political support and sanctions against Russia, ""the result would be tens of thousands of lives saved"". Mr Zelenskyy's speech was a key focus Monday at Davos, the village in the Swiss Alps that has been transformed into a glitzy venue for the four-day confab proclaiming to make the world a better place. The event is resuming in person after a two-year hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also delayed this year's meeting from its usual winter slot. For the attendees, there's much to tackle amid soaring food and fuel prices, Russia's war in Ukraine, climate change, inequality and persistent health crises, but it's hard to predict if the discussions will yield substantial announcements that make headway on the world's most pressing challenges. ""This war is really a turning point of history, and it will reshape our political and our economic landscape in the coming years,"" said the event's founder, Klaus Schwab. Mr Zelenskyy, who received a standing ovation after his remarks, reiterated that Russia was blocking critical food supplies, such as wheat and sunflower oil, from leaving its ports. Ukraine, along with Russia, is a major exporter of wheat, barley and sunflower oil, and the interruption of those supplies is threatening food security in countries in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia that rely on those affordable supplies. The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) said in a panel that ""the failure to open the ports is a declaration of war on global food systems"". WFP executive director David Beasley said the region's farmers ""grow enough food to feed 400 million people"". He said if such supplies remain off the market, the world could face a food availability problem in the next 10 to 12 months, and ""that is going to be hell on earth"". Photographer and Ukranian soldier Dmytro Kozatsky was inside the Azovstal steel plant during the intense battle for Mariupol. These are the pictures he took before being captured by Russian forces. He warned there are ""49 million [people] knocking on famine's door right now in 43 countries"", including Yemen, Lebanon, Mali, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Congo, Guatemala and El Salvador. Mr Beasley called on the world's top mega-billionaires to aid efforts to prevent hunger. ""The world is in real serious trouble,"" he said. ""This is not rhetoric and BS. Step up now, because the world needs you."" Besides My Zelenskyy's speech, a sizeable Ukrainian government delegation is attending in person, making their case for more Western support in the country's fight against Russia.

4,Joe Biden says US would be willing to use force to defend Taiwan against China,world,"  Joe Biden says US would be willing to use force to defend Taiwan against China President Joe Biden has said the US would intervene militarily if China were to invade Taiwan, in one of the most forceful and overt statements in support of Taiwan in decades. Mr Biden made the comment on Monday during his first visit to Japan since taking office, and as Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida looked on. He said the burden to protect the self-ruled island was ""even stronger"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. When asked by a reporter in Tokyo if the United States would defend Taiwan if it were attacked by China, the President answered: ""Yes."" ""That's the commitment we made,"" he said. ""We agree with a one-China policy. We've signed on to it and all the intended agreements made from there. ""But the idea that, that it can be taken by force, just taken by force, is just not, is just not appropriate."" He added that it was his expectation that such an event would not happen or be attempted. He said it would ""dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine"". Mr Biden's comment appeared to be a departure from existing US policy of so-called strategic ambiguity on Taiwan. One of the few areas Joe Biden and Xi Jinping agree on is that letting relations deteriorate further would be a mistake of historic proportions, writes Kathryn Diss. However, a White House official was quick to say after Mr Biden made the remarks that there had been no change in US policy toward Taiwan. ""As the President said, our policy has not changed,"" said the White House official, who declined to be named. ""He reiterated our One China Policy and our commitment to peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. ""He also reiterated our commitment under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself."" Under the ""One China"" policy, the US recognises Beijing as the government of China and doesn't have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. However, it maintains unofficial contacts with Taiwan, including a de facto embassy in Taipei, the capital. The US also supplies military equipment for the island's defence. At this week's Quad meetings, Japan and India will be looking for signs Australia is serious about Asia, and the US will be reviewing its expectations about its AUKUS partner. The President's national security aides shifted in their seats and tilted their heads, studying Mr Biden closely as he responded to the question on Taiwan. Several looked down as he made what appeared to be an unambiguous commitment to Taiwan's defence. Mr Biden made a similar comment about defending Taiwan in October. At that time, a White House spokesperson said Mr Biden was not announcing any change in US policy and one analyst referred to the comment as a ""gaffe"". The United States has long agreed that there is one China, including Taiwan, but it has adopted its ""strategic ambiguity"" on the question of whether it would get involved in military conflict over the island. The remarks came as Mr Biden made tough comments about China's increasingly assertive posture in the region, saying he hoped Russian President Vladimir Putin would pay a price for his invasion of Ukraine in part to show China what it would face if it were to invade Taiwan. The comments are likely to both infuriate Beijing and overshadow the centrepiece of Mr Biden's Japan visit, the launch of an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, a broad plan providing an economic pillar for US engagement with Asia. His trip includes meetings with the leaders of Japan, India and Australia, in the ""Quad"" group of countries. Mr Kishida emphasised Tokyo's readiness to take a more robust defence posture, something the United States has long welcomed. He said that he told Mr Biden that Japan would consider various options to boost its defence capabilities, including the ability to retaliate, signalling a potential shift in Japan's defence policy. That would include a ""considerable increase"" in its defence budget, Mr Kishida said. ""A strong Japan, and a strong US-Japan alliance, is a force for good in the region,"" Mr Biden said at the news conference following their discussions. Mr Kishida said that he had gained support from Mr Biden on Japan's becoming a permanent member of the UN Security Council amid growing calls for reform of the council. China and Russia are permanent members.

5,Ukrainian court sentences Russian soldier to life in prison for killing civilian,world,"  A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial arising from Russia's invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, a tank commander, pleaded guilty to killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the north-eastern Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on February 28 after being ordered to shoot at him from a car. Judge Serhiy Agafonov on Monday said Shishimarin, carrying out a ""criminal order"" by a soldier of higher rank, had fired several shots at the victim's head from an automatic weapon. ""The court has decided: Shishimarin Vadim Evgenyevich … is found guilty … and sentenced him to life imprisonment,"" he said. ""Given that the crime committed is a crime against peace, security, humanity and the international legal order … the court does not see the possibility of imposing a [shorter] sentence of imprisonment on Shishimarin for a certain period."" George Gittoes and his wife, Helen, were watching a movie in their bedroom bunker in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, when two Russian missiles struck the city, a scene they've likened to ""watching Lord of the Rings"". Shishimarin, wearing a blue and grey hooded sweatshirt, watched proceedings silently from a reinforced glass box in the courtroom and showed no emotion as the verdict was read out. For much of the time, he stood with head bowed as he listened to a translator who stood with two guards outside the reinforced glass box. The trial has huge symbolic significance for Ukraine, which has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during the invasion and said it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes. The Kremlin did not immediately comment on the verdict. Moscow has previously said that it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide assistance. Ukrainian state prosecutors said Shishimarin and four other Russian servicemen stole a privately owned car to escape after their column was targeted by Ukrainian forces. The soldiers then drove into the village of Chupakhivka where they saw Mr Shelipov riding a bicycle and talking on his phone, they said. The prosecutors said Shishimarin was ordered by another serviceman to kill the civilian to prevent him reporting on the Russians' presence and he fired several shots through the open window of the car with an assault rifle at Mr Shelipov's head. Mr Shelipov died on the spot. In court last week, Shishimarin acknowledged he was to blame and asked the victim's widow, Kateryna Shelipova, to forgive him. The court reached its verdict five days after holding its first full hearing. In contrast, the International Criminal Court has never handed down a life sentence and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia sentenced only six people to life imprisonment. Mark Ellis, executive director of the International Bar Association, said the verdict was ""not surprising"" and could be the first part of ""a large puzzle also involving Ukrainian soldiers being held in Russia"". ""If this is the baseline trial … it sets the bar very high,"" he said. ""For most other war crimes cases in Ukraine I suspect we'll see similar sentences because this is the baseline trial.""

6,'She wastes cassava': Navigating infertility in the Pacific ,world,"  Lice Movono's fertility issues set 'tongues wagging' — so just how difficult is it for Pacific Island women who want to have children? Pacific Islanders are renowned for having big, tight-knit families, but this notion can create problems for women who struggle with fertility. Little is known about the extent of infertility in the Pacific Islands due to under-reporting and a lack of research. However, one paper in 2018 explored Pacific Islander women's infertility experiences in New Zealand. It found this marginalised group was often stereotyped as being ""hyper-fertile"", compounding the stigma attached to the issue of infertility. Gender, culture and religion also helped reinforce this notion, making matters worse for Pacific Islander women. Hilda Wayne finds out what it is like to struggle with infertility in cultures that value big families. In her early 20s, a routine check-up led Fijian journalist Lice Movono down a path of surgeries and medication in order to have children. It was a large, painful cyst on her ovary that prompted the treatment and fast-tracked thoughts about having a family of her own — her then-partner already had children that she had ""taken to very quickly, very naturally"". However, as she approached her late 20s, Ms Movono said ""tongues started wagging"" and nasty remarks from family — both immediate and extended — intensified. ""In Fiji, there's a derogatory joke that goes around when a woman can't have children – they say, 'She wastes cassava', meaning food is wasted on her because she's not going to give you children,"" she said. ""It was, at that time, a source of a lot of tension or friction between my partner and I and, eventually, my in-laws. Ms Movono used a ""little window"" of time to try to to conceive. ""At the time, I just couldn't fathom the idea that, if I left it too late, I wouldn't be able to have kids,"" she said. Amid the full-time reporting, study and ongoing pain associated with her surgeries, Ms Movono fell pregnant. Nine months later Esther was born. She was, admittedly, a ""huge baby"" who made for a challenging and traumatic delivery. ""I had her at about 39 weeks, and she was 4.6 kilograms because, of course, that's what I needed, to have a humungous baby to deal with,"" she joked. Despite the arduous journey to become a mother, Ms Movono said Esther was ""just the prettiest thing, the easiest baby"". Not long after, Ms Movono fell pregnant again with Esther's brother, Jacob. ""It was a pretty difficult journey,"" she said. ""I know a lot of women who will not talk about these issues because they're of a reproductive health nature and it has a taboo element attached to it,"" she said. Dr Edith Kariko is a Senior Health Specialist with the World Bank in Port Moresby. She said infertility stigma also affected women in Papua New Guinea because sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were a leading cause of fertility issues, and few women want to discuss it. Having control over your sexual and reproductive health is a human right, but research shows two-thirds of Pacific Island women who want to avoid or delay pregnancy are unable to do so. ""If you're a woman of reproductive age, you can't speak up about vaginal discharge or pains in the lower abdomen, pain with urination,"" she said. ""They wait until the last minute and that results in untreated STIs that have already caused complications [to a woman's fertility]."" Dr Kariko said sexual and reproductive health education in schools was inadequate and needed to be revised to create a ""culturally enabling environment"" for such conversations to take place. ""Having the awareness on where they can get help, or what is causing particular infertility, even for young people to discuss this openly before they get into relationships is really critical,"" she said. Dr Leeanne Panisi is the only female fertility specialist among a cohort of four in Solomon Islands and works at Honiara's National Referral Hospital. She said cultural practices such as 'bride price' were being abused in some cases to add pressure on women to conceive. ""There are certain communities where women are expected to get pregnant and have children because ... 'bride price' was paid and the families of the husband or the partner expect her to have children,"" she said. For the women who had exhausted all fertility options, Dr Panisi said, adoption within families was the next best thing. ""Usually the adoption is from a close relative or family member, but it can be also from somebody from a different culture or a distant relative,"" she said. Lealaiauloto Lia'i Si'itia is the director of the Samoa Family Health Association. In Samoa today, Lealaiauloto said women who could not afford to see specialists often sought help from traditional practitioners, despite their procedures being known to ""aggravate"" fertility issues. ""They come very late to family fertility centres because they first seek help from traditional practitioners, caregivers, nurses and sometimes churches,"" she said. ""[The view] is that [women] are not blessed with a child so they need to seek some spiritual blessings, advice and traditional healing.""

7,Ukrainian President Zelenskyy pushes strict Russian sanctions at Davos forum,world,"  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for ""maximum"" sanctions against Russia during a virtual speech to corporate executives, government officials and other elites on the first day of the World Economic Forum gathering in Davos. He said sanctions needed to go further to stop Russia's aggression, including an oil embargo, blocking all of its banks and cutting off trade with Russia completely and that it is a precedent that would work for decades to come. ""This is what sanctions should be: They should be maximum, so that Russia and every other potential aggressor that wants to wage a brutal war against its neighbour would clearly know the immediate consequences of their actions,"" Mr Zelenskyy said through a translator. He also pushed for the complete withdrawal of foreign companies from Russia to prevent supporting its war and said Ukraine needed at least $5 billion in funding per month. ""The amount of work is enormous: we have more than half a trillion dollars in losses, tens of thousands of facilities were destroyed. We need to rebuild entire cities and industries,"" Mr Zelenskyy said, coming days after the G7 countries agreed to provide $19.8 billion in economic aid. He said if Ukraine had ""received 100 per cent of our needs at once, back in February"" in terms of weapons, funding, political support and sanctions against Russia, ""the result would be tens of thousands of lives saved"". Mr Zelenskyy's speech was a key focus Monday at Davos, the village in the Swiss Alps that has been transformed into a glitzy venue for the four-day confab proclaiming to make the world a better place. The event is resuming in person after a two-year hiatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also delayed this year's meeting from its usual winter slot. For the attendees, there's much to tackle amid soaring food and fuel prices, Russia's war in Ukraine, climate change, inequality and persistent health crises, but it's hard to predict if the discussions will yield substantial announcements that make headway on the world's most pressing challenges. ""This war is really a turning point of history, and it will reshape our political and our economic landscape in the coming years,"" said the event's founder, Klaus Schwab. Mr Zelenskyy, who received a standing ovation after his remarks, reiterated that Russia was blocking critical food supplies, such as wheat and sunflower oil, from leaving its ports. Ukraine, along with Russia, is a major exporter of wheat, barley and sunflower oil, and the interruption of those supplies is threatening food security in countries in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia that rely on those affordable supplies. The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) said in a panel that ""the failure to open the ports is a declaration of war on global food systems"". WFP executive director David Beasley said the region's farmers ""grow enough food to feed 400 million people"". He said if such supplies remain off the market, the world could face a food availability problem in the next 10 to 12 months, and ""that is going to be hell on earth"". Photographer and Ukranian soldier Dmytro Kozatsky was inside the Azovstal steel plant during the intense battle for Mariupol. These are the pictures he took before being captured by Russian forces. He warned there are ""49 million [people] knocking on famine's door right now in 43 countries"", including Yemen, Lebanon, Mali, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Congo, Guatemala and El Salvador. Mr Beasley called on the world's top mega-billionaires to aid efforts to prevent hunger. ""The world is in real serious trouble,"" he said. ""This is not rhetoric and BS. Step up now, because the world needs you."" Besides My Zelenskyy's speech, a sizeable Ukrainian government delegation is attending in person, making their case for more Western support in the country's fight against Russia.

8,Indonesia summons Britain's envoy over rainbow flag flown outside embassy,world,"  Indonesia summons Britain's envoy over rainbow flag flown outside embassy Indonesia summoned Britain's ambassador on Monday to explain the raising of an LGBT flag at its embassy and urged foreign missions to respect local ""sensitivities"" following a backlash among conservatives. Barring the sharia-ruled province of Aceh, homosexuality is not illegal in Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, although it is generally considered taboo. The rainbow LGBT flag was flown alongside the United Kingdom flag at the embassy in Jakarta on May 17 to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia, according to an Instagram post by the embassy. In a post accompanying the photograph of the flag, the embassy said the UK believed all people ""should be free to love who they love"". ""Sometimes it is important to take a stand for what you think is right, even if disagreement between friends can be uncomfortable,"" they said. ""Harassment and violence are a routine part of LGBT+ lives, everywhere. This must change."" Alumni 212 Brotherhood, an influential conservative Islamic movement, in a statement said the flag sullied the ""sacred values of Indonesia"". Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Teuku Faizasyah confirmed UK ambassador Owen Jenkins had been summoned. ""The foreign ministry reminds foreign representatives to be respectful of the sensitivities among Indonesians on matters relevant with their culture, religion and belief,"" he said. A UK embassy spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr Faizasyah said despite an embassy being sovereign territory, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations stipulates that only that nation's flag can be flown. Indonesia is becoming less tolerant of its LGBT community as some politicians become more vocal about Islam playing a larger role in the state, according to activists and human rights groups. A 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center also showed 80 per cent of Indonesians believe homosexuality ""should not be accepted by society"". Last week, Indonesia's chief security minister said a revision of the criminal code being considered by parliament included some articles aimed at the LGBT community, a move backed by some conservative politicians. His remarks followed a backlash over a popular podcast that was forced to scrap an episode this month in which a gay couple was interviewed.

9,"Seven killed, 120 rescued in Philippine ferry fire",world,"  Seven killed, 120 rescued after fire engulfs Philippine ferry At least seven people have been killed after a ferry carrying more than 130 passengers and crew members caught fire while approaching a north-eastern Philippine province. Up to 120 people have been found so far, at least four people are still missing and a search operation is continuing, coast guard officials said on Monday. The blaze broke out on the vessel as it carried the passengers and crew from Polillo Island to Real town in Quezon province, located on the main island of Luzon. Coast guard officials said the ship was around seven kilometres away from Real town's port. Many of the 134 passengers and crew were forced to jump into the water, according to coast guard officials. The survivors were rescued by other ferries in the area. Pictures released by the coast guard show fire engulfing the ferry and dark smoke billowing from it. Officials said the fire was believed to have started in the engine room. The burned-out wreckage has now been towed to shore.

10,Ukraine refuses to make territorial concessions as Russia steps up attack,world,"  Ukraine has ruled out a ceasefire or any territorial concessions to Moscow as Russia stepped up its attack in the eastern and southern parts of the country, pounding the Donbas and Mykolaiv regions with air strikes and artillery fire. Kyiv's stance has become increasingly uncompromising in recent weeks as Russia experienced military setbacks while Ukrainian officials grew worried they might be pressured to sacrifice land for a peace deal. ""The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty,"" Andriy Yermak, Ukraine's presidential chief of staff, said in a Twitter post on Sunday. The country has extended martial law for three months through to August 23, as the war drags on. Polish President Andrzej Duda offered Warsaw's backing, telling lawmakers in Kyiv on Sunday that the international community had to demand Russia's complete withdrawal and that sacrificing any territory would be a ""huge blow"" to the entire West. ""Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to (President Vladimir) Putin's demands,"" Mr Duda said, the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since Russia's February 24 invasion. ""Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future,"" he said. Speaking to the same parliamentary session, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed a plea for stronger economic sanctions against Moscow. ""Half-measures should not be used when aggression should be stopped,"" he said. Shortly after both finished speaking, an air raid siren was heard in the capital, a reminder that the war raged on even if its front lines are now hundreds of kilometres away. Mr Zelenskyy said at a news conference with Mr Duda that 50 to 100 Ukrainians are dying every day on the war's eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. Russia is waging a major offensive in Luhansk, one of two provinces in Donbas, after ending weeks of resistance by the last Ukrainian fighters in the strategic south-eastern port of Mariupol. The heaviest fighting focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, interior ministry adviser Vadym Denysenko told Ukrainian television on Sunday. The cities form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv and shifting its focus to the east and south of the country. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using ""scorched-earth"" tactics in the region. ""They are wiping Sievierodonetsk from the face of the earth,"" he said. Ukrainians who have lost limbs during Russia's invasion try to come to terms with their life changing injuries. Russian shelling and ""heavy fighting"" near Sievierodonetsk has continued, but the invading forces failed to secure the nearby village Oleksandrivka, a Ukrainian military statement said. Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday its forces pummelled Ukrainian command centres, troops and ammunition depots in Donbas and the Mykolaiv region in the south with air strikes and artillery. On Sunday evening, multiple explosions were heard throughout the city of Mykolaiv, Mayor Oleksandr Senkevich said in a social media post. Reuters was unable to independently verify those battlefield reports. Russian-backed separatists already controlled parts of Luhansk and neighbouring Donetsk before the invasion, but Moscow wants to seize the remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the region. Ukraine's military said seven civilians were killed and eight injured during Russian attacks in Donetsk on Sunday. Numbers for Luhansk were not disclosed. Ukraine's lead negotiator, Mr Zelenskyy's adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, ruled out any territorial concessions and rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire, saying it meant Russian troops would stay in occupied territories, which Kyiv could not accept. ""The (Russian) forces must leave the country and after that, the resumption of the peace process will be possible,"" Mr Podolyak said in an interview with Reuters on Saturday, referring to calls for an immediate ceasefire as ""very strange"". Concessions would backfire because Russia would use the break in fighting to come back stronger, he said. Recent calls for an immediate ceasefire have come from US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. The first lady of Ukraine recounts how the outbreak of the war in February caused her ""anxiety and stupor"". The end of fighting in Mariupol, the biggest city Russia has captured, gave Mr Putin a rare victory after a series of setbacks in nearly three months of combat. The last Ukrainian forces holed up in Mariupol's vast Azovstal steelworks have surrendered, the Russian defence ministry said on Friday. Ukraine has not confirmed that development, but a commander of one of the units in the factory said in a video that the troops had been ordered to stand down. Full control of Mariupol gives Russia command of a land route linking the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014, with mainland Russia and parts of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists. Russian state gas company Gazprom said on Saturday it had halted gas exports to Finland after Helsinki refused to pay in roubles. Moscow cut off Bulgaria and Poland last month after they rejected similar terms. Along with sanctions, Western nations have stepped up weapons supplies and other aid to Ukraine, including a new $56 billion package from the United States. Moscow says Western sanctions and aid for Kyiv amount to a ""proxy war"" by Washington and its allies. Mr Putin calls the invasion a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and rid it of radical anti-Russian nationalists. Ukraine and its allies have dismissed that as a baseless pretext for the war, which has killed thousands of people in Ukraine and displaced millions. Ukraine's parliament banned the symbols Z and V, used by Russia's military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. Yaroslav Zheleznyak, an opposition member, announced the decision on the Telegram messaging app, saying 313 deputies had voted in favour in the 423-member Verkhovna Rada assembly. Ukrainian forces pushed out Vladimir Putin's men from the eastern region of Kharkiv but, in the Russian military's wake, they found explosives hidden everywhere, from fields to a child's bedroom. Mr Zelenskyy had vetoed an earlier version of the bill and called for the two symbols to be allowed in displays in museums, libraries, scientific works, re-enactments, textbooks and similar instances. Neither of the two letters exists in the Russian alphabet. They have been widely used, particularly on Russian military vehicles and equipment, to promote the aims of the conflict. Moscow calls its invasion of Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbour and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West say the fascist allegation is baseless and the war is an unprovoked act of aggression. The new bill bans the creation of non-governmental organisations using Russian war symbols or undermining Ukraine's sovereignty.

11,Honey tea and traditional medicine: North Korea fights COVID with home remedies,world,"  On a recent night-time visit to a pharmacy, a double-masked Kim Jong Un lamented the slow delivery of medicine. Separately, the North Korean leader's lieutenants have quarantined hundreds of thousands of suspected COVID-19 patients and urged people with mild symptoms to take willow leaf or honeysuckle tea. Despite what the North's propaganda is describing as an all-out effort, the fear is palpable among citizens, according to defectors in South Korea with contacts in the North. Some outside observers worry the outbreak may get much worse, with much of an impoverished, unvaccinated population left without enough hospital care and struggling to afford even simple medicine. ""North Koreans know so many people around the world have died because of COVID-19, so they have a fear that some of them could die, too,"" said Kang Mi-jin, a North Korean defector, citing her phone calls with contacts in the northern North Korean city of Hyesan. She said people who could afford it were buying traditional medicine to deal with their anxieties. Since admitting what it called its first domestic COVID-19 outbreak one week ago, North Korea has been fighting to handle a soaring health crisis that has intensified public anxiety over a virus it previously claimed to have kept at bay. The country's pandemic response appears largely focused on isolating suspected patients. That may be all it can really do, as it lacks vaccines, antiviral pills, intensive care units and other medical assets that ensured millions of sick people in other countries survived. Experts fear a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, which has very limited coronavirus testing capability, a terrible medical system and widespread poverty. North Korean health authorities said on Thursday that a fast-spreading fever had killed 63 people and sickened about 2 million others since late April, while about 740,000 remained quarantined. Earlier this week, North Korea said its total COVID-19 caseload stood at 168 despite rising fever cases. Many foreign experts doubt the figures and believe the scale of the outbreak is being under-reported to prevent public unrest that could hurt Kim's leadership. State media said a million public workers were mobilised to identify suspected patients. Kim Jong Un also ordered army medics deployed to support the delivery of medicines to pharmacies, just before he visited pharmacies in Pyongyang at dawn on Sunday. North Korea also uses state media outlets — newspapers, state TV and radio — to offer tips on how to deal with the virus to citizens, most of whom have no access to the internet and foreign news. ""It is crucial that we find every person with fever symptoms so that they can be isolated and treated, to fundamentally block the spaces where the infectious disease could spread,"" Ryu Yong Chol, an official at Pyongyang's anti-virus headquarters, said on state TV Wednesday. State TV aired infomercials showing animated characters advising people to see doctors if they have breathing problems, spit up blood or faint. They also explain what medicines patients can take, including home remedies such as honey tea. The country's main newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, advised people with mild symptoms to brew 4 to 5 grams of willow or honeysuckle leaves in hot water and drink that three times a day. ""Their guidelines don't make sense at all. It's like the government is asking people to contact doctors only if they have breathing difficulties, which means just before they die,"" said former North Korean agriculture official Cho Chung Hui, who fled to South Korea in 2011. ""My heart aches when I think about my brother and sister in North Korea and their suffering."" Ms Kang, who runs a company analysing the North Korean economy, said her contacts in Hyesan told her that North Korean residents were being asked to thoroughly read Rodong Sinmun's reports on how the country was working to stem the outbreak. Since May 12, North Korea banned travel between regions but has not attempted to impose more severe lockdowns in imitation of China. North Korea's economy is fragile due to pandemic border closures and decades of mismanagement, so the country has encouraged farming, construction and other industrial activities be accelerated. Ms Kang said people in Hyesan were still going to work. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed worry this week about the consequences of North Korea's quarantine measures, saying isolation and travelling restrictions will have dire consequences for people already struggling to meet their basic needs, including getting enough food to eat. ""Children, lactating mothers, older people, the homeless and those living in more isolated rural and border areas are especially vulnerable,"" the UN office said in a statement. Defectors in South Korea say they worry about their loved ones in North Korea. They also suspect COVID-19 had already spread to North Korea even before its formal admission of the outbreak. ""My father and sibling are still in North Korea and I'm worrying about them a lot because they weren't inoculated and there aren't many medicines there,"" said Kang Na-ra, who fled to South Korea in late 2014. Here's five quick questions to help you understand North Korea's COVID crisis. She said a sibling told her during recent phone calls that their grandmother died of pneumonia, which she believes was caused by COVID-19, last September. Defector Choi Song-juk said that when her farmer sister in North Korea last called her in February, she said her daughter and many neighbours had been sick with coronavirus-like symptoms such as high fever, coughing and sore throat. Ms Choi said her sister pays brokers to arrange phone calls, but she hasn't called recently, even though it's around the time of year when she runs short of food and needs money transfers via a network of brokers. Ms Choi, who left North Korea in 2015, said the disconnection is likely related to anti-virus restrictions on movements. ""I feel so sad. I must connect with her again because she must be without food and picking wild greens,"" she said. In recent years, Kim Jong Un has built some modern hospitals and improved medical systems but critics say it's mostly for the country's ruling elite and that the free socialist medical service is in shambles. Recent defectors say there are lots of domestically produced drugs at markets now but they have quality issues so people prefer South Korean, Chinese and Russian medicines. But foreign medications are typically expensive, so poor people, who are a majority of the North's population, cannot afford them. ""If you are sick in North Korea, we often say you will die,"" Ms Choi said. Kim Jong-un says North Korea has avoided a coronavirus outbreak. His grip on power may depend on it. Despite the outbreak, North Korea has not publicly responded to South Korean and US offers of medical aid. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that the world body was ""deeply concerned at the risk of further spread"" in North Korea and the lack of information about the outbreak. Choi Jung Hun, a former North Korean doctor who resettled in South Korea, suspects North Korea is using its pandemic response as a tool to promote Mr Kim's image as a leader who cares about the public and to solidify internal unity. He says the country's understated fatalities could also be exploited as a propaganda tool. ""One day, they'll say they've contained COVID-19. By comparing its death toll with that of the US and South Korea, they'll say they've done a really good job and their anti-epidemic system is the world's best,"" said Mr Choi, now a researcher at a Korea University-affiliated institute in South Korea.

12,Japan claims China is trying to extract Japanese gas in East China Sea,world,"  Japan protests Beijing's extraction of undersea gas reserves in East China Sea Japan has lodged an official protest with China after discovering what it claimed were efforts by Beijing to develop gas fields in disputed waters in the East China Sea. Tokyo's foreign ministry said it had confirmed that Beijing was building in the area — where the two countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZ) overlap — and submitted a complaint to the Chinese embassy. Japan ""strongly urged an early resumption of negotiations over the implementation"" of a 2008 bilateral agreement regarding the development of resources in the East China Sea, it added. That agreement saw Japan and China agree to jointly develop undersea gas reserves in the disputed area, with a ban on independent drilling by either country. But negotiations over how to implement the deal were suspended in 2010. ""It's extremely regrettable that the Chinese side is unilaterally proceeding with development in the waters,"" the ministry said. ""The borders of the economic exclusive zones and the continental shelf are yet to be settled in the East China Sea."" Japan has long insisted the median line between the two nations should mark the limits of their respective EEZs. But China insists the border should be drawn closer to Japan, taking into account the continental shelf and other features of the ocean. Tokyo accused China of positioning 17 suspected drilling rigs close to its de facto maritime border with Japan. The rigs are on China's side of the border, but Tokyo fears gas on the Japanese side can also be extracted. The two countries are embroiled in a separate row over disputed islands elsewhere in the East China Sea. China claims the string of islands — which Japan refers to as the Senkakus — as its own, and regularly sends ships and aircraft into the area to test Tokyo's response times. China also has disputes with several other nations in the South China Sea, which it claims in its entirety.

13,"Fearing they will disappear if they follow orders to cover their faces, female Afghan TV presenters defy Taliban",world,"  Female TV presenters defy Taliban order to cover faces on air Female presenters on Afghanistan's leading TV channels have appeared on air without covering their faces, defying a Taliban order that they conceal their appearance to comply with the group's austere brand of Islam. Since surging back to power last year the Taliban have imposed a slew of restrictions on civil society, many focused on reining in the rights of women and girls. Earlier this month Afghanistan's supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada issued a diktat for women to cover up fully in public, including their faces, ideally with the traditional burqa. The feared Ministry for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ordered women TV presenters to follow suit by Saturday. Previously they had only been required to wear a headscarf. But broadcasters TOLOnews, Shamshad TV and 1TV all aired live programmes on Saturday with women presenters' faces visible. The Taliban promised a ""free and independent"" media, but now Afghanistan's once flourishing media sector is ""dying"" and women are paying the highest price. ""Our female colleagues are concerned that if they cover their faces, the next thing they will be told is to stop working,"" said Shamshad TV head of news Abid Ehsas. ""This is the reason they have not observed the order so far,"" he told AFP, adding the channel had requested further discussions with the Taliban on the issue. Taliban orders such as this have caused many female journalists to leave Afghanistan since the hardline Islamists stormed back to power, a woman presenter said. ""Their latest order has broken the hearts of women presenters and many now think they have no future in this country,"" she said, requesting not to be named. ""I'm thinking of leaving the country. Decrees like this will force many professionals to leave."" Many Afghan activists posted on social media in support of female presenters, condemning the order as another step toward making women ""disappear"" from society. Mohammad Sadeq Akif Mohajir, spokesman for the vice ministry, said the women presenters were violating the Taliban directive. ""If they don't comply we will talk to the managers and guardians of the presenters,"" he said. ""Anyone who lives under a particular system and government has to obey the laws and orders of that system, so they must implement the order."" The Taliban have demanded that women government employees be fired if they fail to follow the new dress code. Men working in government also risk suspension if their wives or daughters fail to comply. Mr Mohajir said media managers and the male guardians of defiant woman presenters would also be liable for penalties if the order was not observed. During two decades of US-led military intervention in Afghanistan, women and girls made marginal gains in the deeply patriarchal nation. Not all Afghan women are willing to obey the latest order from the Taliban to wear the full-length burka and veil. Soon after they took over, the Taliban promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001. Since the takeover, however, women have been banned from travelling alone and teenage girls barred from secondary schools. In the 20 years after the Taliban were ousted from office in 2001, many women in the conservative countryside continued to wear a burqa. But most Afghan women, including TV presenters, opted for the Islamic headscarf. After the Taliban takeover, television channels were ordered to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women. Reporters and photographers were threatened, harassed, arrested and beaten for attempting to cover protests and stories that reflect negatively on the new leaders. An estimated 75 per cent of radio and television broadcasting shut down entirely after the Taliban seized control and hundreds of reporters fled the country or went into hiding.

14,Why is Indonesia's President hanging out with 'super genius' Elon Musk?,world,"  Why is Indonesia's President Joko Widodo hanging out with Elon Musk? Indonesia's President Joko Widodo visited Washington last weekend along with other South-East Asian leaders, as his US counterpart Joe Biden seeks to court the region against growing Chinese influence. But it was a trip to the small town of Boca Chica, Texas, that attracted more attention back home in Indonesia. Mr Widodo had lined up a high-profile meeting with Tesla and Space X founder Elon Musk at the private space agency's headquarters, where he was given a private tour. As Mr Widodo praised the tech baron as a ""super genius"", Mr Musk declared he was ""very interested"" in the future of Indonesia, a country of 270 million people. The world's richest man also said the country exuded ""positive energy"". ""We're going to look, from a Tesla and Space X standpoint, to try and do some partnerships in Indonesia,"" Mr Musk said, flagging ""future collaboration on many fronts"". Indonesia, South-East Asia's largest economy, seeks to cash in on the global transition to electric vehicles (EVs) by luring foreign investment from the likes of Mr Musk. Nickel is a key component of lithium-ion battery cells, which are used in most EVs. So demand for the metal is rapidly increasing. Australia has the critical minerals, now we just need the industry around it. Sumitomo Metal Mining — Japan's largest nickel smelter and a supplier for the Panasonic lithium-ion batteries used in Tesla EVs — said in March it expected global demand for nickel to increase by 20 per cent during 2022 alone. According to research firm Wood Mackenzie, nickel consumption for EV batteries is projected to increase 64 per cent between 2019 and 2025. Along with Australia, Indonesia has the world's largest nickel reserves, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), an American government body. USGS reports that mine production in Indonesia increased by 30 per cent during 2021, which it attributed to the ""ongoing commissioning"" of projects across the resource-rich archipelago. Mr Widodo's visit to Space X followed a recent meeting between Mr Musk and senior minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, and Indonesian officials told Reuters that working-level discussions on investment in the nickel industry had already taken place. Indonesia's Minister for Investment, Bahlil Lahadalia, said Mr Musk would ""lose out"" if he did not invest in the country. ""I think it's great that Indonesia has a big population and the population is growing,"" Mr Musk said during his meeting with Mr Widodo in Texas. ""This is very good. Because, like, we need a lot of people for the future — and also Mars. Mars does not have any people, so we need people for Mars,"" he joked. ""Indonesia seems very optimistic and positive about the future, which is awesome,"" Mr Musk added. ""I'm really fired up by how fired up you all are."" But not everyone is so excited by the prospect of further investment in nickel mining in Indonesia, which is associated with coal-fired power plants. When this diver saw more rubbish than fish in the ocean, she took action. A group of Indonesian environmental activists have written to Mr Musk, pointing to previous statements the billionaire has made around environmental sustainability. ""If Tesla wants to invest in Indonesia, they should make it free from coal-fired power plants,"" said Pius Ginting, coordinator of the Action for Ecology and People's Emancipation Association (known by its Indonesian acronym AEER), in the letter. ""Because doing so conflicts with the aim of electric transportation: reducing total gas emission,"" he added. In mid-2020, Mr Musk called upon mining firms to boost their production of nickel to meet Tesla's needs. ""Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way,"" Mr Musk said at the time. Indonesia has long sought to boost domestic processing of nickel ore and other minerals — not just exporting the raw product — partly as a way to create local jobs. But smelting nickel in Indonesia often relies on energy from coal, and environmentalists say the country's nickel industry does not meet ""environmentally sensitive"" standards. While Indonesia has committed to ending the construction of new coal-fired power plants after 2023, coal power generation remains a key source of energy and accounts for more than a third of the country's total carbon emissions. Moh Taufik hopes Tesla will consider environmental harm caused by mining companies on the island of Sulawesi — the source of much of Indonesia's nickel. ""Nickel mining activity has violated residents' rights to breathe in clean air,"" Mr Taufik, coordinator of Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM) in the province of Central Sulawesi, told the ABC. A 2019 study by AEER found that coal plants used for the production of nickel in the Central Sulawesi town of Morowali had caused respiratory infections among local residents. AEER reports that disposal methods by nickel plants in Sulawesi pose ""a grave threat to the rich marine life in Indonesia's seas"" and affect the livelihoods of fishermen. ""If the company wants to invest in the area, hopefully it's not planning to throw hazardous waste used as raw materials for electric vehicles [into] the sea in Morowali and other regions,"" Mr Taufik said. AEER argues that when small-scale nickel mining operations began in Morowali in the late 2000s, traditional farmers in the area were affected by floods exacerbated by the extractive industry. Environmentalists in Indonesia claim that among the thousands of tonnes of paper bales sent to East Java are household waste items including faeces-contaminated nappies. Morowali is now the site of the largest nickel-based industrial area in Indonesia, funded by domestic and Chinese investors. And in 2020, flash floods hit Morowali, swamping two villages and forcing 175 residents to evacuate. Mr Taufik said the Indonesian government must also weigh the consequences for residents if Tesla ever builds a facility in Sulawesi. ""The government have to determine whether this decision will benefit local residents or will just trigger land conflicts between company and residents,"" he said. ""Tesla's decision to come and build a power plant might remove residents from their living or working areas, like farms."" ""This very likely to happen and local residents will definitely lose."" The Indonesian Environment Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Tesla was also approached for comment.

15,An underground world: Odesa catacombs transformed into shelter for hundreds of civilians ,world,"  A group of volunteers from the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa have taken their fight to save lives underground into one of the world's largest labyrinths of catacombs. Descending more than 20 metres deep into the dark, forgotten tunnels, the group has been working to turn sections of the tunnels into liveable bomb shelters. Before the war, 32-year-old electrical engineer and blogger, Roman Mauser, explored and made videos of the catacombs. Now, as the city faces increased attacks by Russian forces, he is using his knowledge to ""save lives"". ""On the night [of February 24], the first rocket hit Odesa and almost every day [now] we have air-raid alerts,"" Mr Mauser told the ABC. Over the past month, Russian missiles have struck Odesa's shopping mall, a warehouse and a military airfield. ""I understood it won't stop and we had to prepare everything that can help … we decided that this place, the catacomb, is the best [way] we can prepare,"" Mr Mauser said. The group has chosen a particular part of the catacombs which has a suitable structure. It consists of three connected shelters built in Soviet times that could house more than 1,000 people. ""The main advantage of this place is that it is really deep. If rockets will directly hit this place, it will stand,"" Mr Mauser said. ""It has three or four entrances: even if one entrance will collapse, we can exit through another."" Despite the natural advantages, the tunnel network is not a ready-made bomb shelter. Stretching over 2,500 kilometres, the catacombs were created in the 19th century for limestone mining and were later used by partisans to fight against Nazis during World War II. Parts were then prepared as a nuclear bomb shelter during the Cold War but abandoned as the Soviet Union collapsed. ""So we have really lots of jobs to do … everything is destroyed here and we have to rebuild it,"" Mr Mauser said. Volunteers have prepared the catacombs by clearing debris, making electricity lines and installing LED bulbs and wooden benches with thermal insulation, he said. Mr Mauser has a bomb shelter under his apartment, so has not needed to use the catacombs himself. But more than 100 people, particularly residents living in newer buildings that did not have bomb shelters, had used the catacombs shelter during air raid alerts, he said. ""Some people stayed there all day on the ninth of May because we were afraid that Putin would launch some sort of nuclear missile on Ukraine … Russia always loves to make something on this date."" Sofiia Marchuk remains in Odesa, hoping to complete her international relations studies at the city's Mechnikov National University. ""The attacks have worsened because most of them are targeting civilians,"" she told the ABC. Despite this, many people were planning to stay, as some Ukrainian refugees were now trying to return home, she said. Ms Marchuk explained that most people used their car parks or basements as shelters. Those who can't make it to shelters have to rely on the ""rule of two walls"" method to protect themselves. This involves finding a position in the house between two walls — the first wall takes the force of the explosion, while the second works as a shield against shrapnel. Odesa has meant romance and terror for as long as I can remember. Now another generation of refugees are fleeing terror — this time from war and occupation. Life in Odesa was a ""life-war balance"", with people continuing their everyday activities, Ms Marchuk said. She has seen people still going for a morning coffee or even doing workouts. ""People are combining their activities with volunteering and helping the army with what they can,"" Ms Marchuk added. ""All I can say [is that] people in Odesa are more concentrated on helping those who really struggle."" ""We feel hope that it will all end soon with our victory and we will rebuild our country, and people will be able to visit Odesa and see how beautiful it is."" Not all catacombs were suitable to be used as bomb shelters, Mr Mauser said. Most only have one entrance and are disconnected from each other, and a bomb shelter needs to have two. They are also made of different types of stone — some are strong enough to withstand explosions while others may collapse. ""If artillery shelling intensifies, I think we can build five or six big catacomb bomb shelters in Odesa,"" Mr Mauser said. ""Odesa's catacombs are the biggest underground system in the world, we are talking about more than 1,000 kilometres. ""We can save almost everybody, but it's not about the size, it's about supplies."" The plan is to make the catacombs more liveable, but the group is restricted by its lack of financial resources. ""We need electrical generators, we need more toilets … All that is built here is made by donations from people from Odesa,"" Mr Mauser said. ""I don't have any job now, I think 50 per cent of people in Ukraine now don't have jobs."" According to the International Labour Organization, nearly 5 million jobs have been lost in Ukraine since the war began. Leonid Tanatarov, an Odesa psychologist and catacombs tour guide, is among those who lost their job. ""In peaceful times, one of my favourite jobs was [giving] a tour inside the catacombs,"" he said. ""People all around the world want to see this underground world."" Mr Tanatarov is looking to get another qualification not affected by war, such as IT, although it is not his area of interest. Millions in Ukraine have been forced to flee their homes since Russia's invasion. Here's how some of them are coping with isolation, homesickness and curfews. He is now doing various volunteering work, including answerings calls on a psychological helpline and delivering humanitarian aid to those in need. ""Unclear future provokes mental instability and neurosis. People are losing earth under their feet, we help them to find stable personal ground,"" he said. Mr Tanatarov said in the first weeks of war, people were ""tense"". ""Now it's the opposite. Many refugees are coming here [to Odesa], escaping war zones in the East,"" he said. He said despite the frequent air raid alerts and looming missile strikes, the fighting was less intense than in some other parts of the country and Odesa was adapting. ""Businesses are open. Food markets, restaurants, shops, everything works. Only hotels stand empty,"" he said. ""Of course, there are less people, less cars. Sea trading is blocked, so the port stands still."" He has no plan to leave Odesa and is not worried about a further escalation. ""It's not a way [to live] to fear things which have not happened yet.""

16,'It's really hard to leave your country': Tiibea is already preparing for climate-induced migration,world,"  Report highlights risk of climate-induced statelessness and nationality loss in the Pacific Kiribati-born Tiibea Baure moved to Australia in 2008 as a nursing student with a plan for her extended family's future. ""So when one day they have to migrate due to climate change, I'm here, ready to take them on board,"" the Toowoomba-based aged care service manager said. But Ms Baure said starting a life abroad came with its challenges. When she arrived in Australia, she didn't have access to Medicare or other social services and finding work for her husband — who arrived later — was difficult. The 34-year-old permanent resident said the idea of Pacific Island nations having to consider the relocation of their people was never easy to think about, but had to be planned for. ""We can't run away from the fact and we just have to prepare ourselves for when that time comes,"" she said. For Pacific nations, climate change is not a future event — it's already happening. ""It's really hard to leave your country. We're very connected to our land. ""It's sad that over time our culture will disappear, or how we identify ourselves."" The human rights, identity and dignity of Pacific islanders who may be forced to migrate due to climate change are at the heart of a report out today. The Future of Nationality in the Pacific looks at how law amendments could prevent statelessness and nationality loss in the context of climate change. Michelle Foster is the director of the Peter McMullin Centre on Statelessness at Melbourne Law School and is one of the report's authors. ""Very little attention has been given to the question of the connection between climate change and statelessness,"" Professor Foster said. ""So the purpose of this report is to try to shed some light, to bring this issue to the attention of the global community and really to start a conversation around what sort of preventative action might be taken now, to ensure that statelessness does not result from climate-induced displacement."" The report examined the nationality laws of 23 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICT) to assess what existing risks may be present in legislation and the potential for additional risks as populations migrate. Professor Foster said while migration was not the preferred option for PICT, it was one of the possibilities facing countries on the front lines of climate change. Professor Foster said statelessness could expose someone to a life of discrimination and bar them from accessing an education, legal rights to work, vote, get married, or even open a bank account. ""So generally, statelessness is not just that a person feels that they don't belong. In some legal sense, it actually has an enormously detrimental impact on their life,"" she said. ""We're also concerned about this loss of nationality, and that even if a person does have a legal right to live in a dignified way in a new country … the loss of their original nationality, could still have all sorts of implications for them both legally, socially [and] culturally."" According to the report, under current citizenship laws, some Pacific islanders who leave their homes permanently are at risk of losing the citizenship of their home country, or the ability to pass this on to their children. Some may even be at risk of statelessness and nationality loss even before they leave the country, the report said. An example of this is the gender discrimination provisions in Kiribati's citizenship laws that mean that only the father can pass on Kiribati citizenship to children born outside the country. ""One of the points we make in the report is … there are examples of countries that have laws that could potentially be right now contributing to statelessness, let alone if people need to move,"" Professor Foster said. ""So that gender discrimination element is really important."" The report makes 15 recommendations for amendments to laws for Pacific Island nations to consider, to ensure people don't fall through legislative gaps and connection to their homeland can be retained. ""We're making these suggestions with great humility, understanding that the states involved need to ultimately decide what is best for their own future,"" Professor Foster said. In a case never before seen in Australia, Paul Kabai and Pabai Pabai's legal team will argue the Federal Court should require Australia to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a level that will prevent Torres Strait Islanders from harm. Among the recommendations is that Pacific Island nations could sign on to two UN Statelessness Conventions which sit at the heart of international human rights law. ""Very few states in the Pacific have actually ratified or signed on to those key treaties and so we suggest that that's just a really good starting point because it gives those countries a framework for thinking about how their own laws may comply with minimum standards,"" Professor Foster said. The report also recommends amendments to nationality laws that remove discrimination based on gender and suggests putting legal safeguards in place to protect children at birth from becoming stateless, including when born overseas. Additionally, the report recommends amending laws that could see people lose their nationality through living abroad. ""For example, even just voting in an external election, or even perhaps taking on a second citizenship may mean that you lose your nationality,"" Professor Foster said. ""We're recommending that consideration be given to revising nationality laws, and amending them to ensure that people don't lose their citizenship in a way that is not really connected to national security."" Allowing nationals living abroad to participate in overseas voting is also among the recommendations, as long as consideration is given to balancing the interests of those who still reside in the territory. ""More broadly, there's clearly a need for countries like Australia and New Zealand to think through what displacement in our region may look like and how countries like Australia and New Zealand can work with Pacific states to find durable solutions for people that need may need to move because of climate-induced impacts in a way that upholds human dignity.""

17,"This social media app is a safe space for free speech, but this is what happens when you criticise the wrong people",world,"  Inside the secret chat rooms censoring critics on a pro-Trump 'free speech' social media app 阅读中文版本 An ABC investigation has uncovered how Australian followers of an anti-Chinese government movement are censoring critics on a ""free speech"" social media platform. Twitter look-alike app Gettr bills itself as a platform which is ""defending free speech"" and has become a safe space for divisive personalities and those spreading conspiracies about COVID-19 and President Joe Biden's family. Launched last July, Gettr claims it has 4.5 million users and its high-profile accounts include former Trump luminaries such as former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, as well as Australian politicians Liberal senator Alex Antic and One Nation candidate George Christensen. The former US president himself is reportedly considering joining the app after the disastrous rollout of his own social media platform, TRUTH Social. Gettr has also attracted members of the New Federal State of China (NFSC), a political movement founded by Mr Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon and exiled billionaire Guo Wengui. The pair have used the platform to boost their anti-Chinese Communist Party (CCP) credentials and Mr Bannon has spruiked Gettr as being outside the moderation policies present on ""big tech oligarchs"" such as Twitter. But insiders have revealed Gettr is actually subjected to round-the-clock monitoring by NFSC members, who flag content for take-down. Criticism on the platform of Mr Bannon and Mr Guo, their organisations and Gettr itself is often quickly identified by NFSC members and removed, contrary to the platform's mission to combat ""cancel culture"". When Mr Bannon and Mr Guo launched the NFSC from a boat anchored near the Statue of Liberty in New York in 2020, they also established the Himalaya Supervising Organization (HSO) to support its cause. The HSO network is spread across the world and its local branches in each country, referred to as Himalaya Farms, serve as a base of operations for its online and offline activities. The branches can be found across the United States, Australia, UK, Canada, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Spain, Italy, Germany, and New Zealand. Tens of thousands of accounts have joined Himalaya Farm servers on messaging service Discord — at least two chat rooms within the servers, seen by the ABC, are dedicated to monitoring Gettr 24/7. Followers are vetted before gaining access to the ""Gettr reporting room"". They're required to provide a copy of their passport, records of donations to NFSC-aligned groups and examples of writings that show support to the movements and its leaders. An ABC investigation unravels a sophisticated cryptocurrency operation endorsed by a political movement founded by exiled billionaire Guo Wengui and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Once initiated, they are trained to monitor for what they deem ""suspicious"" content, which is often expressions of pro-CCP sentiments or comments critical of the NFSC movement. The rank-and-file of these verified followers include ""patrollers"" who clock-in for two-hour shifts to identify and flag ""offensive"" posts or accounts to ""administrators"" who then review them for deletion. Another former member of the NFSC movement, Lisa Chen, who was active in these Discord channels said posts that questioned Mr Guo on Getter would be deleted ""in a couple of minutes"". ""Gettr is said to fight against cancel culture, but in fact, it is a total supporter of cancel culture,"" Ms Chen said. ""You can't see anything bad about them, and you can't question them."" Several deleted posts and comments identified by patrollers include one questioning transparency of the Rule of Law foundation, a charity co-founded by Mr Bannon and Mr Guo. Opinions that NFSC-aligned censors deemed as pro-CCP were also deleted. Accounts that are flagged for deletion have also dropped off the purported free-speech platform, including one Gettr user whose account disappeared after posting Mr Guo might soon be charged for contempt of court in reference to legal cases the businessman is facing in the United States. One censor took a screenshot of the post and wrote: ""attacking Mr Guo, cancel account"". Within one hour, an administrator replied the ""account has been cancelled"". John Pan, was once a loyal supporter of Mr Guo and the movement but left after becoming disillusioned. He was then subjected to harassment from Mr Guo and his followers. He said he registered an account on Gettr in his own name days after the platform was launched but within 12 hours, and before he posted anything, it was taken down. Mr Pan said insiders in the chatrooms sent him screenshots showing his account was flagged by patrollers. ""Gettr is just a dishonest website,"" Mr Pan said. ""The censorship system is even heavier than websites based in China."" It is unclear how these take-downs are actioned within Gettr, but a spokeswoman for the company said it worked with users and ""super volunteers"" to identify activity which violated Gettr's terms of services and community guidelines. She claimed ""thousands of CCP troll accounts and bots have directed their attention"" towards Gettr, and added it would defend platform users from ""malicious nation-state actors"". ""Gettr platform moderation is performed by both artificial intelligence and a team of human moderators trained in multiple languages popular on our platform,"" the spokeswoman said. ""As part of this, Gettr works with experienced US-based third-party vendors and a globally distributed team of full and part-time moderation support staff, and like other social media companies, this includes both platform users and super volunteers."" The spokeswoman said Gettr did not have a policy of banning criticism of ""specific individuals, groups of individuals, or political movements, including but not limited to Mr Guo or Mr Bannon"". ""The content moderation carried out by our moderators is regularly reviewed to ensure that our moderators conduct their work … without favour or disfavour to any person, group, or political viewpoint,"" she said. The ABC emailed questions to representatives to Himalaya Farm. They did not respond. As well as removing undesirable content, Ms Chen said followers were encouraged to register multiple Gettr accounts and other social media platforms, and to use fake profiles. The ABC has seen chatroom administrators instruct accounts to write glowing comments about the NFSC and its leaders in English. ""They asked us to spread Guo's words everywhere, post it as widely as possible, on every account users we followed, "" Ms Chen said. ""They said it (Gettr) is a platform for English audiences, especially American audiences."" Please use this form to get in contact with the ABC Investigations team, or if you require more secure communication, please choose an option on the confidential tips page. Ms Chen said members were also told to follow certain people, including Mr Pompeo and Mr Bannon. The Gettr spokeswoman said in response to questions around fake profiles: ""Anyone who believes in free speech and abides by our Terms of Service is welcome to use Gettr, including supporters of Mr Guo."" Neither Mr Bannon nor Mr Guo responded to ABC questions, but the pair have been prominent promoters of the platform, with the latter's account referring to the app as ""Miles Guo's Gettr"", in reference to his English name. The Gettr spokeswoman said Mr Guo had no leadership role or daily involvement with the company. The spokeswoman added, however, one of its financial backers was an international investment fund ""that has ties with, but is not controlled or managed by, the Guo Family Foundation"". Two men who worked in a propaganda machine led by Steve Bannon and billionaire Guo Wengui are speaking out about the tactics and motives behind the secretive conspiracy group. ""Mr Guo is a passionate ally of Gettr and believes in its mission of fighting political censorship,"" she said. With the recent plan to purchase Twitter by billionaire Elon Musk who has promised to position it as a free speech platform, the future and appeal of Gettr remains unclear. In an interview in the same week Gettr launched, Mr Bannon praised it for being a more tolerant environment for free speech than Twitter and predicted it would boom just like Fox News did in the 90s. ""The power of Gettr is that all of those ideas can be discussed on an open forum … and nobody can stop you,"" he said.

18,'We're going to lose this place': Postcards from the frontlines of climate change,world,"  Postcards from the frontlines of climate change Tok Pisin • 中文版 • Indonesian Note: The following article is an interactive storytelling feature — to experience it in its intended format please click here. Australia has some 16 Pacific Island neighbours — some with a landmass a millionth our size — who unanimously declare climate change the ""single greatest threat"" to the region. To quickly get a sense why: many of these nations are isolated and vulnerable, spread across hundreds of atolls, often less than a metre above sea level, and home to some of the most culturally rich, biodiverse ecosystems. For context, the NSW city of Lismore is up to 50 times the size of some of them. For decades they've been pleading for action — as across the Pacific, climate change is not a hypothetical future event, it's already happening, with relocations and legal measures to protect sovereignty already underway. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns the window for action is rapidly closing — here's a record of what that looks like on the frontlines, and what those that live there have been trying to tell us.* Note: This story is not displaying as intended — click here to experience it in its optimised interactive format.

Unlike neighbouring continental giants, Pacific Island countries are isolated and surrounded by vast ocean, without the geographical, environmental, or financial security a large, wealthy landmass provides. Many fear they are one volcanic eruption, one cyclone, or a minor sea level rise away from total uninhabitability. The consequences of which are not only the loss of sovereignty and refugee crises, but the loss of one of the most culturally diverse, vibrant and important regions of the world — home to hundreds of unique languages, indigenous cultures, and endemic flora and fauna. For Pacific Island nations, climate change is not a debatable future concern open to interpretation, but a present reality that boils down to one fundamental question: can we afford to entertain the possibility that climate change is not an urgent existential threat, and be wrong? On the frontlines, the answer is simple: No. Also available in: Tok Pisin, Chinese & Indonesian *Editor's Note: The information gathered for this story encompasses 20 years of ABC reporting on climate change in the Pacific presented against the latest research and statements from leading research bodies.

19,Osaka weighing up whether to go to Wimbledon after first-round French Open exit,world," Sport Naomi Osaka may sit out Wimbledon after losing in French Open first round to Amanda Anisimova Four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka may not travel to Wimbledon after the decision by the sport's authorities to strip the tournament of ranking points. Osaka's comments came after she was knocked out of the French Open in the first round by 27th seed Amanda Anisimova 7-5, 6-4. Wimbledon last week had its ranking points taken away by the men's ATP and women's WTA after the grasscourt major opted to exclude players from Russia and Belarus because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""I would say the decision is kind of affecting, like, my mentality going into grass. I'm not 100 per cent sure if I'm going to go there,"" four-time major winner Osaka said at a press conference. ""I would love to go just to get some experience on the grass court, but at the same time, for me, it's kind of, I don't want to say pointless, no pun intended, but I'm the type of player that gets motivated by … seeing my ranking go up."" Osaka has been vocal about prioritising her mental health on the gruelling international tennis tour. This year marked her return to Roland Garros after she boycotted press conferences at the 2021 tournament, citing their effect on her mental health. She was fined and ultimately withdrew from the tournament after facing backlash for her decision. The removal of ranking points from Wimbledon was met with ""deep disappointment"" by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), which repeated its stance that the ban was the only viable option under British government guidance. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) also said it would not grant ranking points to Wimbledon this year for junior and wheelchair tennis events. The AELTC decision to impose the suspension on Russian and Belarusian players at this year's championships is the first time players have been excluded on grounds of nationality since the immediate post-World War II era, when German and Japanese players were banned.

21,"Pete Davidson says goodbye to SNL — and name drops Kanye, Ariana Grande",world,"  Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon make their final appearance on Saturday Night Live Pete Davidson and Kate McKinnon have taken their final bows on the Saturday Night Live stage. The popular comedians departed during the show's 47th season finale on Saturday, leaving the sketch institution without arguably its two most famous names. Veteran cast-mates Aidy Bryant and Kyle Mooney also made their final appearances in the episode hosted by Natasha Lyonne, representing one of the biggest cast shake-ups in years. Davidson, well-known for his life offscreen — dating Ariana Grande and current girlfriend Kim Kardashian — wasted no time name-dropping in his final monologue on 'Weekend Update'. ""Hello, Colin and Che and millions of people only watching to see if I bring up Kanye,"" Davidson opened with. While he refrained from mentioning his saga with Ye, the comic revealed that SNL boss Lorne Michaels told him his relationship with ex-fiance Ariana Grande was doomed from the start. ""I called him when I got engaged. I was like, ‘Lorne, I just got engaged to Ariana Grande after dating her for two weeks.’ He goes, ‘Oh, well, hold on for dear life.’ It’s a true story.” Davidson, the show's ""resident young person"", joined the cast at just 20 years old in 2014. He thanked SNL and Michaels for always having his back and allowing him to grow. ""Thank you to Lorne for never giving up on me or judging me even when everyone else was, for believing in me and allowing me to have a place I could call home with the memories that will last a lifetime. Thank you.” His own outsize personality often outshone the characters he played and it was his comic commentaries as himself on “Weekend Update” that often went most viral. Kate McKinnon, 38, celebrated the end of her 10-year run on the show, which saw her take home two Emmys and nine nominations. She was known for her impressions of political figures like Hillary Clinton and characters like the famous alien abductee Miss Rafferty. McKinnon opened the show as Miss Rafferty and an 'out-of-this-world' skit, and said her final goodbyes on “Earth.” “I love ya, thanks for letting me stay awhile. Live from New York, it's Saturday night,” she said to open the show. Bryant, 35, joined the cast at the same time as McKinnon and has been a constant in sketches ever since, getting four Emmy nominations of her own. Mooney, 37, appeared in nine seasons starting in 2013.

22,Kiwi blasts round Indy 500 track at 376 kph to set new pole speed record,world," Sport Flying Kiwi Scott Dixon sets new pole speed record at Indianapolis 500 Kiwi driver Scott Dixon has smashed the Indianapolis 500 pole-winning record with a breathtaking qualifying run of more than 376 kph. His hands were shaking when he climbed from his car following his first run on Sunday, but the New Zealander was nonplussed and went back out for an incredible final run. His four-lap average of 376.661 kph around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway gave Dixon the fifth Indy 500 pole of his career. He will lead the field to green next Sunday local time (Monday AEST). ""That's what this place is about, the ups and downs that you have just in one day, it's crazy,"" Dixon said. ""I think that's kind of what we all secretly thrive on, right? To live on that edge is an amazing feeling and when you do nail it, that's what it's all about. ""Days like these are amazing."" Considered the best driver of his generation, Dixon's average broke Scott Brayton's pole-winning record of 376.1 kph set in 1996. Arie Luyendyk holds the overall four-lap qualifying record of 381.4 kph, also done in 1996, but not in a run for the pole. Dixon's qualifying run was the second-fastest in 106 runnings of the prestigious race. Dixon's first lap was an eye-popping 377.3 kph and drew a roar from the fans. His second lap was 376.8 kph, leading wife Emma to bend over the pit wall in amazement, her hands covering her mouth. Dixon's drop-off from there was minuscule: his fourth and final lap was 376.1 kph as his consistency gave Chip Ganassi Racing its seventh Indy 500 pole. ""The first number does mean a lot, and when I saw 234 [miles per hour], it was 'OK, this is going to be a good run,'"" Dixon said. ""But you're busy, you're consumed. Gone on the early years of just hitting the apexes and enjoying the speed."" Dixon also started from the pole in 2008 when he scored his only Indy 500 win, as well as in 2015, 2017 and last year. Reigning IndyCar champion Alex Palou said he knew he would be beaten by his teammate. ""There was not a lot of nerves, I kinda knew he was going to get it,"" Palou said. ""I was super comfortable and I did everything I had. ""I kind of wish because Scott already had four poles here, he could have given me one, but he doesn't share much."" ""I think we could have put rocket fuel in our engine and, I still think, not beat Scott,"" third-place qualifier Rinus VeeKay said. ""He was not just a fraction faster, he was a lot faster than everyone else.""

23,Rising Warriors star to step away from rugby league at age 23 ,world," Sport Warrior star Chanel Harris-Tavita to take hiatus from rugby league at age 23 Warriors playmaker Chanel Harris-Tavita never expected to make this decision but at the age of 23, he has chosen to take a hiatus from the NRL. ""I want to take a break from rugby league,"" he said. ""I've made the decision in the last couple of weeks. ""Over the last year, I haven't been enjoying it as much as I want to, even though being an NRL player was something I dreamed of as a kid."" He will leave the Warriors at the end of the 2022 NRL season and says his decision is not related to mental health. Arguably the most talented New Zealand playmaker to come through the Warriors since Shaun Johnson's arrival at NRL level in 2011, Harris-Tavita has it all. A nice step, a rock-solid defensive game and a left boot equal parts power and precision. But just 44 games into his NRL career, the playmaker has decided to put that on hold. ""I have felt guilty when I think about the decision I'm making,"" he said. ""There are plenty of kids out there that would love to be in my position. Stepping back from the game might look like I'm taking it all for granted. ""I just think it's the best decision for me. Each time I told a family member or friend, it was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. ""I was scared to say it out loud, let alone tell my family, friends, and teammates. Most of the people I told were shocked, but they were all very supportive, which I'm thankful for. ""I'm extremely grateful for the experiences I've had and the people I've worked with. ""Soon it'll be time for a change of scenery."" Harris-Tavita intends to use 2023 to travel and continue his newfound hobby of writing. He is still keen to represent Samoa or New Zealand at the Rugby League World Cup later this year. The playmaker says the pressure of coming off-contract this year was the catalyst for him to finally make his decision. The Warriors offered Harris-Tavita a new deal in the pre-season but he knocked them back and said he wanted to hold off, eager to prove his worth after two injury-affected years. But the delay was partly because he knew he was living a lie. ""I was trying to delay the contract decision,"" he said. ""Deep down, I knew I didn't want to sign another contract and I was trying to hide that feeling from everyone including myself. ""A couple of weeks ago, my manager was coming to Brisbane to negotiate my contract and I said to myself: 'Am I going to grow some balls and make this decision now or am I just going to keep everyone else happy?' ""Before that, I was practically lying to everyone about what I wanted to do."" After being part of the Warriors side which has been forced to live in Terrigal, Tamworth, the Gold Coast and now Brisbane over the last three years, Harris-Tavita hopes to finish this chapter of his NRL journey back in Auckland. ""It's been a long time coming,"" he added. ""Hopefully we can play some good footy and get a good turnout. ""Knowing there's an end in sight, I'm sure I'll appreciate each moment a little bit more.""

24,"At least eight killed in Canada thunderstorms, more than 500,000 lose power",world,"  Thunderstorms kill at least eight in Canada, 500,000 lose power The death toll from powerful thunderstorms in Canada's two most populous provinces has risen to at least eight. Canadian authorities made the announcement as emergency crews continued a massive clean-up to restore power to half a million people. The storms, which lasted more than 2 hours on Saturday afternoon and packed the power of a tornado, left a trail of destruction in parts of Ontario and Quebec. Wind gusts as strong as 132kph felled trees, uprooted electric poles and toppled many metal transmission towers, utility companies said. Electricity companies were scrambling on Sunday to restore transmission lines. Most of the deaths from the storms occurred when people were hit by falling trees, authorities said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government was ready to help those in need. ""We're thinking of everyone affected, and thanking the crews who are working to restore power,"" Mr Trudeau said. Hydro One, Ontario's largest electricity distribution company, said its crews were responding to significant damage. Environment Canada had issued mobile alerts warning of the severe thunderstorms. Hydro One crews had restored power to more than 360,000 customers, with over 226,000 customers remaining without power, the company said in a statement late on Sunday. Restoration efforts are likely to continue for several days before power is restored to all customers, the company says.

26,Justin Thomas wins PGA Championship in thrilling playoff finish after Mito Pereira's heartbreaking implosion,world," Sport Justin Thomas wins PGA Championship in thrilling playoff finish against Will Zalatoris after Mito Pereira's heartbreaking implosion Justin Thomas has won the PGA Championship for the second time, beating fellow American Will Zalatoris in a play-off. Thomas began the final day seven shots back, before launching a spectacular comeback — with three birdies on the back nine — to secure a place in the three-hole play-off. Both players birdied the 13th hole, before Thomas drove the short par-4 17th for another birdie ahead of Zalatoris' par. The Kentucky native then parred the 18th to clinch a one-shot win. Chilean golfer Mito Pereira had led for most of the final round, before hitting his tee shot in the water on the 18th to finish tied for third. Thomas, who first won the PGA Championship in 2017, impressed in difficult conditions over the first two days at Southern Hills Country Club but a poor Saturday performance left him with a lot of work to do. After a slow start to his final round, Thomas gathered momentum to start putting pressure on the leaders throughout his back nine. But even so, Pereira seemed to have the field at arm's length for the most part as Zalatoris, Cam Young and Matt Fitzpatrick failed to make ground on the Chilean. With a one-shot lead going into the 18th hole, a horrible tee shot from Pereira led to a double-bogey six which took him from the outright lead to a shot behind the playoff pair. Zalatoris had to make a clutch par putt on the 18th green in regulation to make the playoff, and faced off with Thomas in the three-hole shootout. But Thomas kept his nerve to edge Zalatoris by a single shot and secure the Wanamaker Trophy again. See how the action unfolded in our live blog. By Dean Bilton Justin Thomas beat Will Zalatoris by one shot in a three-hole playoff. By Dean Bilton I've got to be honest, I thought this final round was fizzling away a couple of hours ago when none of the contenders looked interested in putting the hands out and really grabbing this tournament. It took a final-hole implosion from Mito Pereira and some seriously impressive golf from Justin Thomas to make this a memorable major, and I think we certainly have a deserving champion. Thanks for joining me this morning, look forward to seeing you at the US Open for 2022's third major. By Dean Bilton He had to come from a long way back today, but Justin Thomas was probably the stand-out performer over the first two days of this tournament. He was part of an unlucky group of players who were stuck playing in the worst weather conditions on each of those first two rounds, but managed to remain in contention despite that. Thomas has been playing stellar golf all year without being able to close. A few opponents may have had to fall away to make today's comeback a reality, but he's deserved a bit of luck. When it got to the playoff, he played just about flawless golf. He's already had the phone call from his mate Tiger Woods, and Justin Thomas channelled a little bit of the Cat in the closing stages of this tournament. By Dean Bilton From seven shots back at the start of the day to champion in a playoff, what a day for Justin Thomas. In a leaderboard packed with rookies and players yet to taste victory at the highest level, it taught one of the best players in the world to show them how to handle the moment and step up to the occasion. Justin Thomas is now a two-time major winner, and as the tears roll down his face you can see what it means to him. By Dean Bilton He has two putts to win the PGA Championship for the second time. This one is down hill, so expect him to nurse it down there pretty gently. Got to be careful not to whack this one. It's a thing of beauty from Justin Thomas! He rolls it just past the hole and will tap in for the title... By Dean Bilton The ball is nestling along the fringe. He'll have to whack this up the hill and let it break sharply right to left. Don't know what the data guys would say, but I give him about a 1% chance from here. It's a good putt, but not good enough. He has a pretty comfy one left for par. By Dean Bilton A good shot here could just about seal it. He has nine iron, and adrenaline bursting through him. And Justin Thomas has found the green! That's all he had to do, stay away from the bunkers and give yourself two putts to win. In all likelihood, Zalatoris will have to make an incredibly difficult birdie putt or Justin Thomas will be our champion. By Dean Bilton A reminder, Justin Thomas currently has a one-shot lead in the playoff. This is the last of three holes. Zalatoris needs to make something happen right here, right now. Zalatoris has 182 yards to the hole. Needs to hit a cut. Tell you what, that is not bad.... but it's trickling away from the hole along the edge of the green. Still, he'll have a birdie putt no matter how difficult it may be. That was a low, cutty little swing that very nearly came off brilliantly. By Dean Bilton Just has to hit the fairway, give yourself a chance. He does that, but he's a long way back from JT's drive. He has a chance, but he'll need to hit the iron shot of his life coming in. By Dean Bilton He hit an absolute beauty in regulation, a low stinging cut. What's he got this time? It's even better! That was a VERY provocative line, and for a second he might have worried about a bad kick into the creek to the right of the fairway. But it scooted straight and is in the perfect position. By Dean Bilton I don't need to tell you what can happen on this hole, but I will anyway. About 30 minutes ago, Mito Pereira had a one-stroke leading going into this final hole. He sliced his tee shot into the creek, made a double-bogey six and finished a shot out of the playoff. Justin Thomas leads by one, but nothing is safe on this the toughest hole at Southern Hills Country Club. By Dean Bilton By Dean Bilton For birdie and the lead with one playoff hole to play. NEVER. IN. DOUBT. Justin Thomas is a hole away from his second PGA Championship. He leads the playoff by a stroke. By Dean Bilton Such an important putt. Eight feet for birdie. And he's pushed it. Zalatoris chases after it quickly and taps in his par, but that could be very costly indeed. By Dean Bilton I might have been a bit generous with the 20 feet estimation, it's more like 35. It's not an easy putt, but major champions have a knack of making these. Didn't give it enough. A little nervous about sending that past the hole and down the hill I think. He's marking his ball and letting Zalatoris putt next, but he should be safely in for birdie from there. By Dean Bilton A real tester for the short game here, needs to fly it over the bunker but get it to stop quickly after the hole. And that is exactly what he does! A very classy chip that will leave him about eight feet for birdie. Great comeback. By Dean Bilton Right, how do you answer that? Uh oh. It's avoided the creek, which I didn't think it would for a moment, but that one has missed miles to the right. He'll have a very delicate little chip over the bunker to come. Advantage JT. By Dean Bilton What has he got? OH IT'S STUNNING! Justin Thomas finds the back of the green with a spectacular tee shot! He'll have 20 feet for his eagle! By Dean Bilton A fantastic hole these last two days since they brought the tee box up. This is a par-four the players have to try to get to in one. Length isn't a problem, but you have to hit such a precise fade to find the green and avoid the nasty bunkers and creeks near the green. This will be fun to watch.

27,Manchester City's stunning comeback wins Premier League title before rival keeper hit in post-match pitch invasion ,world,"  Manchester City claim Premier League title on dramatic final day of action Manchester City have produced a stunning come-from-behind victory to shatter Liverpool's hopes and once again be crowned champions of the English Premier League on a dramatic final day, with Ilkay Gundogan the hero. However, the joy in Manchester led to the latest in a series of pitch invasions — at various levels in English football — which have caused concerns for the safety of players and others. Elated fans rushed the pitch after Manchester City clinched a 3-2 win over Aston Villa to secure the club's fourth Premier League crown in five seasons. It nearly turned nasty, however, as Villa keeper Robin Olsen was hit by a fan in the melee as he tried to make his way off the ground. Manchester City later released a statement apologising to Olsen: ""Manchester City would like to sincerely apologise to Aston Villa goalkeeper Robin Olsen, who was assaulted after the final whistle at today's match when fans entered the pitch,"" the club said in the statement. ""The club has launched an immediate investigation and, once identified, the individual responsible will be issued with an indefinite stadium ban."" Going into their final match of the season with a one-point lead over the Reds, the equation had been simple for City: beat Aston Villa and become champions, but on the day it proved harder. City were down 1-0 at half-time after Matthew Cash scored for Villa, while Liverpool were level with Wolverhampton at 1-1 and level on the ladder with City on 90 points (but behind on goal difference) as the title race went into the final 45 minutes of the season. City's problems were then compounded when former Reds midfielder Philippe Coutinho, helping out the club he scored 41 goals for, doubled Villa's lead in the 67th minute. The goal was as simple as they come as Ollie Watkins headed on from a long Olsen goal kick, and the former Liverpool midfielder Coutinho produced a brilliant first touch to cut inside and then drilled the ball into the bottom corner. At the same time Liverpool were pressing against Wolves but couldn't find their moment as Anfield was on edge. With 15 minutes to go it seemed City might have blown their title chance until 5 minutes of play changed the complexion of the title race. First, Gundogan struck in the 76th minute as he headed in a Raheem Sterling cross to make it 2-1 to Villa. Then two minutes later Rodri levelled for City as the Spaniard side-footed an Oleksandr Zinchenko pull back into the net from outside the area. And then Gundogan struck again on 81 minutes as he tapped in a Kevin de Bruyne cross to give City a 3-2 lead with what would be the goal that sealed the title, despite Liverpool going on to defeat Wolves 3-1 after late goals to Mohamed Salah and Andrew Robertson. Gundogan himself was stunned with the comeback. ""It was an unbelievable game, I don't know what to say to be honest,"" he said. ""It's been fantastic, the last 20 minutes, scoring three goals, unbelievable. ""After going 2-0 down, the chances were very, very small. ""I think we had to do the simple things again in the best possible way and scoring the two goals in three minutes gave us the right lift. ""We are proud of ourselves today."" The title is City's fourth in five seasons but the first time that they have claimed the title at home. For Liverpool, it was a day of disappointment, the mood at Anfield different to the one of joy in Manchester but that could change next week when they take on Real Madrid in the Champions League final next weekend in Paris. ""The lads have given everything, so you can't have too many issues,"" Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson told Sky Sports. ""We've given absolutely everything all season, right until the last day, and in January we'd have bit your hand off to take it to the last day. ""We're a bit disappointed today. We've got to say congratulations to City, of course, and then focus on the match next week."" While not winning the title was difficult for Liverpool, it was a much worse day for Burnley, who after seven seasons in the top-flight will drop to The Championship. Needing a win to stay ahead of Leeds, Burnley fell to Newcastle 2-1, as Leeds managed a 2-1 victory over Brentford to secure another season in the Premier League.

Muguruza has recently appeared out of sorts, with the world number 10 racking up early losses in Madrid, Rome and Rabat, but appeared to be in good touch early in her opening round match with veteran Estonian Kaia Kanepi and took the first set 6-2. But the ever-dangerous Kanepi, who made the quarter-finals at this year's Australian Open roared back into the match to take it 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 as a frustrated Muguruza slapped the court with her racquet. Kanepi, who has twice made the final eight at Roland Garros — the last time in 2012 — and won the girl's singles back in 2001 simply showed too much class for Muguruza as she out-hit her, cranking winners from both side in the later sets. For the 36-year-old Kanepi, the win opens up her part of the draw which includes fellow Estonian, fifth-seed Anett Kontaveit. Asked how she turned the match around Kanepi said: ""I didn't change much, I just made more balls and my serve was better in the second and third sets."" Her dismissal of Muguruza followed the tournament opening with a shock on Court Phillipe-Chartrier as sixth-seed Jabeur, who has been one of the form players on tour this year, was ousted in three sets by Poland's Magda Linette. Jabeur became the first major casualty when she crashed out with a 3-6, 7-6(7/4), 7-5 loss to the world number 52. Jabeur, seen as one of the big threats to world number one Iga Świątek at the tournament, came to Paris at a career-high ranking and with a tour-leading 17 wins on the surface this season. ""I wanted to go as far as I could in the tournament because I played well on clay in Madrid and in Rome, and it's difficult to take that one in,"" Jabeur said. ""But that's what sport is like and you need to be smart enough to move forward and get back on court. So maybe it was a good thing to lose today. ""I would rather say this and be really tough with myself than waste all the good energy that I got from Madrid and Rome."" With her win in Madrid and runner-up finishes in Rome and Charleston, it appeared Jabeur would have an easy outing against Linette when she made a strong start. The 27-year-old suffered an early break of serve before breezing through the opening set in 37 minutes before Linette raised her game. Linette, 30, had only defeated Jabeur in the first of their four meetings back in 2013 but she staged an inspired fightback in the second set, saving four break points to level the match in the tiebreak. As drops of rain fell on the main showcourt, Jabeur's level also dipped and her unforced errors climbed and she made her frustration evident by kicking balls away after losing points. Linette, who lost to Jabeur in the third round last year, went up 4-2 in the third set but saw her advantage slip away when Jabeur broke her serve back to stay alive. But the Pole sealed the match when the Tunisian wasted a 40-0 lead in the 12th game and found the net on match point to be broken for the second time in the set. ""I lost to her last year here, and then this year in Miami, and so I kind of knew what to expect,"" Linette said. ""I knew that she was really on fire this time and I would really need to play point by point, be really mentally tough. I'm really happy that I managed to stay really calm and strong."" Right at the end of a long, largely wretched day, Australian tennis has found its saviour on a shocking Sunday at the French Open. Step forward never-say-die qualifier Jason Kubler, who finally put a first-round victory on the board at 9.40pm at Roland Garros, more than 10-and-a-half hours after play on a brutally hard opening day began. The first four Aussies in action — Chris O'Connell, Alexei Popyrin, Astra Sharma and Thanasi Kokkinakis — had already bitten the red dust. Then Kubler, the man perhaps least fancied to negotiate his first-round tie, stepped up in the darkness — with the floodlights shining on the ominously numbered Court 13 — and saved the day. The one-time wonder boy of Australian tennis — who had battled through three tough qualifying matches to get to the main draw — defeated streetwise American Denis Kudla 7-6(7/5), 7-6(7/2), 7-6(7/3) to become the first of the 11-strong contingent to make it through. Sydney wildcard O'Connell had kicked off the singles challenge on a humid morning with high hopes, only to depart Court 8 wholly deflated by a 2-6, 4-6, 7(7/5)-6, 1-6 loss to Slovenian Aljaz Bedene. Next to fall was last year's ""big thing"", Popyrin, whose 2022 struggles continued at the hands of Fabio Fognini, the erratic 34-year-old Italian swashbuckler who found the odd touch of his old magic as he gave the young Sydneysider a bit of a lesson 6-4, 7-5, 6-4. Perth's Australian number two Sharma, the first woman in action, came agonisingly close to victory over Varvara Gracheva, standing just two points away from winning when a startling pass from the Russian kick-started her revival to win 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. Sharma was so shocked by Gracheva's winner that she actually applauded her in the heat of battle. Kokkinakis got involved in a real slugfest with Spanish clay-court specialist Albert Ramos-Vinolas, and looked shattered to go down 4-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-7(7/5) in a see-saw four-setter. The pain was obvious for the Adelaide man, who missed out on a second-round date with Spain's new teenage comet Carlos Alcaraz, who just got better and better as he pulverised Argentine Juan Ignacio Londero 6-4, 6-2, 6-0. But former junior world number one Kubler — who'd saved a match point in his second round qualifier against Radu Albot — simply would not be denied as night fell, proving just too teak-tough in each of three tiebreaks that he dominated. He had two match points denied by the American before he hammered a glorious winning backhand down the line in front of a by-now sparse crowd after more than three-and-a-quarter hours, letting out a primal roar.

29,Verstappen takes advantage of Leclerc's power failure to win Spanish Grand Prix,world," Sport Max Verstappen wins Spanish Formula 1 Grand Prix, Daniel Ricciardo finishes 12th A suspected engine failure has cost Charles Leclerc at the Spanish Grand Prix, helping Max Verstappen claim victory and the championship lead. Leclerc led by more than 10 seconds and was the fastest car on track when he lost power on lap 27 of 66 in the scorching Barcelona sun. Verstappen, who spun off the track and had a faulty DRS, made a three-stop strategy work for him as the defending champion moved ahead in the drivers' championship. Leclerc had the perfect start from pole position and led into turn one, building a small margin to Verstappen over the opening laps. When a gust of wind at the left-handed turn four later sent Verstappen into the gravel, the Ferrari driver looked set to extend his lead in the drivers' championship. Leclerc said he had no warning before his car failed, ending his hopes of a third win of the season. ""I had no indications before and it just broke and lost power completely,"" he told Sky Sports F1. ""It's a shame. In those moments I believe there is nothing else I can do but look at the positives. ""We cannot afford for this to happen many times during this season so we need to find the problem."" Verstappen had a frustrating race for the first 27 laps, with the spin on lap nine dropping him from second to fourth. After being allowed past by his teammate Sergio Perez into third, Verstappen spent more than a dozen laps behind the Mercedes of George Russell. Verstappen's DRS problems from Saturday's qualifying came back to haunt Red Bull during the race. When the Dutchman went to open his rear wing for the speed boost it would intermittently fail, making overtaking Russell a challenge. The same problem cost Verstappen a chance at pole position on Saturday in qualifying, angering the world champion who was heard swearing over the radio to his team. But once Leclerc was out Red Bull immediately pitted Verstappen to change to a three-stop strategy. It was a masterstroke as Verstappen was able to put the mechanical issues behind him and dominate the race. ""We managed to sure the strategy to get ahead … to do our own race and eventually win,"" Verstappen said. ""I tried to stay focused, it's not nice when stuff like that happens. ""At the end I'm very happy to win."" By entering his 216th race, Daniel Ricciardo will set a new Australian record for the number of races in F1, with eight wins and 32 podium finishes over 11 years. Despite starting from ninth position, Daniel Ricciardo had a largely forgettable Spanish Grand Prix. The Australian moved up to eighth early before falling down the order and never looked like threatening the top-10 finishing in 12th. It was better news on the other side of the McLaren garage, with Lando Norris driving a super race. The Briton started 11th after a difficult qualifying session on Saturday, but he was faultless in Sunday's race. Norris rallied to finish eighth, securing much-needed points for McLaren.

30,Ukrainian soldier's photos capture life inside besieged Azovstal steel plant,world,"  Somewhere inside the grimly defended Mariupol steel plant, where he and his comrades were making their last stand, one Ukrainian soldier was tackling a crossword puzzle. With reading glasses perched on the end of his nose and deep in concentration, he looked peaceful — in this war-torn city and amid a violent siege that was anything but. Squeezed against a concrete wall in heavy combat boots and camouflage fatigues, he was surely uncomfortable, but too engrossed to care. Or to notice the photographer hovering to his right, immortalising the moment inside this last bastion of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol — the pulverised Azovstal steel mill. For nearly three months, Azovstal's garrison clung on, refusing to be winkled out from the tunnels and bunkers under the ruins of the labyrinthine mill. Because of its tenacious defence, not only were Russian troops who had captured the rest of Mariupol unable to declare victory, they couldn't be peeled away to fight in battles on other Ukrainian fronts. Both sides were trapped, in an enduring image of the months-long war. Photographer-soldier Dmytro Kozatsky was among them, on the Ukrainian side. He is now a prisoner of war. His photos are his legacy. Mr Kozatsky posted a selection of images on Twitter before joining the stream of troops laying down their arms this week. They marched out of the Azovstal mill in their hundreds, carrying the wounded. They were following orders from the Ukrainian high command to save their lives because they'd fulfilled their mission to hamper Russia's advance. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu then reported to President Vladimir Putin the ""complete liberation"" of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at Azovstal had surrendered. But Mr Kozatsky's photos tell stories that can't be razed so easily, immortalising the defenders in lulls between fighting. One shows a soldier smoking a cigarette to its nub. Was it to be his last? In another, with an electric trimmer, one fighter calmly trims a comrade's silver hair. Life, even here, must go on, it seemed to whisper, gaining power from its mundaneness. One more shows two members of the garrison lost in thought, staring into a wood fire. It's easy to imagine that they were conjuring up memories of happy familiar faces and calmer times miles away. Mr Kozatsky's last messages on Twitter were posted on Friday morning. ""Well, that's all. Thank you from the shelters of Azovstal — the place of my death and my life,"" he wrote. He posted a link to his photos, for downloading ""while I am in captivity"". ""Send them to all journalistic awards and photo contests,"" he said. ""If I win something, it will be very nice after the release.""

31,"Sea-launched cruise missiles destroy Western arms consignment in Ukraine, says Russian military",world,"  The Russian military says it has destroyed a major consignment of Western arms in Ukraine's Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles. The defence ministry said in a statement the strike took out ""a large batch of weapons and military equipment delivered from the USA and European countries"" that was intended for Ukrainian troops in the eastern Donbas region where the fighting is concentrated. Reuters could not independently verify the report, which also said Russian missiles had struck fuel storage facilities near Odesa on the Black Sea coast and shot down two Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft and 14 drones. In its latest update on the war, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", the defence ministry also said Russia had struck numerous Ukrainian command posts. The West has stepped up weapons supplies to Ukraine since Russia's February 24 invasion and Russia's military is trying to intercept and destroy them. Moscow says Western arms deliveries for Kyiv, and the imposition of drastic sanctions against the Russian economy, amount to a ""proxy war"" by the United States and its allies.

32,Tiger Woods pulls out of PGA Championship,world," Sport Tiger Woods withdraws after PGA Championship third round due to soreness in his surgically-repaired right leg Tiger Woods has withdrawn from the PGA Championship after shooting a 9-over-par 79 in Saturday's third round. It marked the first withdrawal in Woods' professional career. Woods, 46, shot 1-under-par over the final five holes Saturday to avoid recording a score in the 80s for the third time in a major. Still, it was his worst round ever at a PGA Championship. It was a gritty effort at the end for Woods, who started the day at 3-over 143 and finished at 12 over and stood 21 strokes out of the lead when his third round ended at Southern Hills Country Club. Clearly struggling to make it through 18 holes on his rebuilt right leg, Woods and his team declined an on-camera interview with CBS Sports following the round. Instead, Woods and his reps told the CBS television crew that he was sore. On Friday, Woods made the cut at a major for the second time in two tries since nearly losing his right leg 15 months ago in a devastating single-car crash in southern California. He shot a 1-under-par 69 on Friday to sneak in under the cut line. In the third round, he started with a par but found the water on the second hole for a bogey. His real troubles began on the par-3 sixth hole, when his tee shot landed in the water again, his shot from the drop area found the rough to the left of the green, and he hit his pitch short of the green. After hitting a chip shot to about two feet from the cup, he putted out for a triple-bogey 6. From there, Woods' round unravelled on a chilly morning. He bogeyed the seventh and the ninth to leave him with a 41 on the front nine. The bogey on the par-4 ninth hole was the first of five straight bogeys for Woods, a four-time PGA Championship winner. He won at Southern Hills in 2007, the most recent time the tournament was played at the course. Woods never before had carded five straight bogeys at a major championship. The bright spot of Woods' day came on the 413-yard, par-4 15th. Woods flashed his first smile of the day when he drained a 12-metre putt for his only birdie on the round. Woods' worst-ever round in a major championship came in 2002, when he shot an 81 in the third round at The Open Championship at Muirfield -- the same year in which he won the Masters and the U.S. Open. He shot an 80 in the first round of the U.S. Open in 2015 at Chambers Bay.

33,Honey tea and traditional medicine: North Korea fights COVID with home remedies,world,"  On a recent night-time visit to a pharmacy, a double-masked Kim Jong Un lamented the slow delivery of medicine. Separately, the North Korean leader's lieutenants have quarantined hundreds of thousands of suspected COVID-19 patients and urged people with mild symptoms to take willow leaf or honeysuckle tea. Despite what the North's propaganda is describing as an all-out effort, the fear is palpable among citizens, according to defectors in South Korea with contacts in the North. Some outside observers worry the outbreak may get much worse, with much of an impoverished, unvaccinated population left without enough hospital care and struggling to afford even simple medicine. ""North Koreans know so many people around the world have died because of COVID-19, so they have a fear that some of them could die, too,"" said Kang Mi-jin, a North Korean defector, citing her phone calls with contacts in the northern North Korean city of Hyesan. She said people who could afford it were buying traditional medicine to deal with their anxieties. Since admitting what it called its first domestic COVID-19 outbreak one week ago, North Korea has been fighting to handle a soaring health crisis that has intensified public anxiety over a virus it previously claimed to have kept at bay. The country's pandemic response appears largely focused on isolating suspected patients. That may be all it can really do, as it lacks vaccines, antiviral pills, intensive care units and other medical assets that ensured millions of sick people in other countries survived. Experts fear a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, which has very limited coronavirus testing capability, a terrible medical system and widespread poverty. North Korean health authorities said on Thursday that a fast-spreading fever had killed 63 people and sickened about 2 million others since late April, while about 740,000 remained quarantined. Earlier this week, North Korea said its total COVID-19 caseload stood at 168 despite rising fever cases. Many foreign experts doubt the figures and believe the scale of the outbreak is being under-reported to prevent public unrest that could hurt Kim's leadership. State media said a million public workers were mobilised to identify suspected patients. Kim Jong Un also ordered army medics deployed to support the delivery of medicines to pharmacies, just before he visited pharmacies in Pyongyang at dawn on Sunday. North Korea also uses state media outlets — newspapers, state TV and radio — to offer tips on how to deal with the virus to citizens, most of whom have no access to the internet and foreign news. ""It is crucial that we find every person with fever symptoms so that they can be isolated and treated, to fundamentally block the spaces where the infectious disease could spread,"" Ryu Yong Chol, an official at Pyongyang's anti-virus headquarters, said on state TV Wednesday. State TV aired infomercials showing animated characters advising people to see doctors if they have breathing problems, spit up blood or faint. They also explain what medicines patients can take, including home remedies such as honey tea. The country's main newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, advised people with mild symptoms to brew 4 to 5 grams of willow or honeysuckle leaves in hot water and drink that three times a day. ""Their guidelines don't make sense at all. It's like the government is asking people to contact doctors only if they have breathing difficulties, which means just before they die,"" said former North Korean agriculture official Cho Chung Hui, who fled to South Korea in 2011. ""My heart aches when I think about my brother and sister in North Korea and their suffering."" Ms Kang, who runs a company analysing the North Korean economy, said her contacts in Hyesan told her that North Korean residents were being asked to thoroughly read Rodong Sinmun's reports on how the country was working to stem the outbreak. Since May 12, North Korea banned travel between regions but has not attempted to impose more severe lockdowns in imitation of China. North Korea's economy is fragile due to pandemic border closures and decades of mismanagement, so the country has encouraged farming, construction and other industrial activities be accelerated. Ms Kang said people in Hyesan were still going to work. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed worry this week about the consequences of North Korea's quarantine measures, saying isolation and travelling restrictions will have dire consequences for people already struggling to meet their basic needs, including getting enough food to eat. ""Children, lactating mothers, older people, the homeless and those living in more isolated rural and border areas are especially vulnerable,"" the UN office said in a statement. Defectors in South Korea say they worry about their loved ones in North Korea. They also suspect COVID-19 had already spread to North Korea even before its formal admission of the outbreak. ""My father and sibling are still in North Korea and I'm worrying about them a lot because they weren't inoculated and there aren't many medicines there,"" said Kang Na-ra, who fled to South Korea in late 2014. Here's five quick questions to help you understand North Korea's COVID crisis. She said a sibling told her during recent phone calls that their grandmother died of pneumonia, which she believes was caused by COVID-19, last September. Defector Choi Song-juk said that when her farmer sister in North Korea last called her in February, she said her daughter and many neighbours had been sick with coronavirus-like symptoms such as high fever, coughing and sore throat. Ms Choi said her sister pays brokers to arrange phone calls, but she hasn't called recently, even though it's around the time of year when she runs short of food and needs money transfers via a network of brokers. Ms Choi, who left North Korea in 2015, said the disconnection is likely related to anti-virus restrictions on movements. ""I feel so sad. I must connect with her again because she must be without food and picking wild greens,"" she said. In recent years, Kim Jong Un has built some modern hospitals and improved medical systems but critics say it's mostly for the country's ruling elite and that the free socialist medical service is in shambles. Recent defectors say there are lots of domestically produced drugs at markets now but they have quality issues so people prefer South Korean, Chinese and Russian medicines. But foreign medications are typically expensive, so poor people, who are a majority of the North's population, cannot afford them. ""If you are sick in North Korea, we often say you will die,"" Ms Choi said. Kim Jong-un says North Korea has avoided a coronavirus outbreak. His grip on power may depend on it. Despite the outbreak, North Korea has not publicly responded to South Korean and US offers of medical aid. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that the world body was ""deeply concerned at the risk of further spread"" in North Korea and the lack of information about the outbreak. Choi Jung Hun, a former North Korean doctor who resettled in South Korea, suspects North Korea is using its pandemic response as a tool to promote Mr Kim's image as a leader who cares about the public and to solidify internal unity. He says the country's understated fatalities could also be exploited as a propaganda tool. ""One day, they'll say they've contained COVID-19. By comparing its death toll with that of the US and South Korea, they'll say they've done a really good job and their anti-epidemic system is the world's best,"" said Mr Choi, now a researcher at a Korea University-affiliated institute in South Korea.

34,"George Gittoes and his wife, Helen, are documenting war in Ukraine and how it is transforming artists' lives",world,"  George Gittoes and his wife, Helen, were watching a movie in their bedroom bunker in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, when two Russian missiles struck the city. ""Suddenly, 'Boom', the whole house shook. A huge explosion, like nothing I've ever heard before,"" Gittoes said. It was May 9, and the Australian artist and his wife were watching the final scene in the film Lord of the Rings. ""Everyone here is watching Lord of the Rings because they feel the Russians are like the orcs and Putin is like one of the monstrous evil forces that are inflicting themselves on the people,"" Gittoes said. But before the credits rolled, the missiles hit. Instead of staying put, the pair ran outside where they were met by their neighbours. Gittoes said he had a flashback to being in Gerringong during the bushfires in two years ago. ""It was that feeling … standing outside our homes when the fires were coming, wondering whether they [would] reach our houses, and we'd have to start hosing them down."" Gittoes eventually learned the Russian projectiles had struck a large shopping centre and an oil depot — the equivalents of ""Miranda Fair"" and the Kurnell oil depot in Sydney's south. ""So, when these things get taken out, everyone finds it hard to get fuel anymore. And most people know and love their local shopping centre. So that's what it's like."" George and Helen arrived in mid-March, intent on making a documentary about Ukrainian artists. ""The creative people who were poets, musicians and filmmakers, who never thought that they'd have to take up a gun or have their lives threatened … their whole world has changed."" He said one famous artist he met once only painted cats. Now she creates the toughest anti-war art he's ever seen. They met another artist who has become a tattooist. She puts ""magic charm"" tattoos on the hands of soldiers before they go off to war to protect them against Russian bullets. ""[The war has] transformed their lives,"" he said. During his time in Ukraine, Gittoes said he had noticed many similarities to Australia. He compared Odesa and its community to ""like being in Newtown or St Kilda or the Adelaide performing space"". ""The people here are very like Australians,"" he said. The multi-award-winning artist — who has been honoured with an Order of Australia for his contributions to film and arts — said the parallels between Ukraine and Australia have hit a nerve with him. ""What's very different for me that Ukraine [has a] level of cultural similarities to our culture,"" he said. He said the cultural similarities were unlike what he saw when he documented conflicts in countries such as Bosnia, Afghanistan and Rwanda. ""They're not people who've been hardened by years of [a] dictator like Saddam Hussein or fighting, you know, like the Afghans against the Russians.""

35,Knee injury sours Ellie Carpenter's Women's Champions League win with Lyon,world," Sport Australia's Ellie Carpenter stretchered off with knee injury in Lyon's Women's Champions League final win over Barcelona Lyon women have regained their European crown, but the joy is bittersweet for Australia's Ellie Carpenter after she suffered a potentially serious knee injury. The full-back was substituted after 13 minutes of Lyon's 3-1 win in the UEFA Women's Champions League final after her knee gave way in open play. A few minutes earlier she had hurt it while challenging Fridolina Rolfo. She received her medal on crutches with her left leg in a brace, which ran all the way up to her thigh. Lyon were already a goal up when Carpenter departed, Amandine Henry having scored a stunning goal after six minutes. Ada Hegerberg added a second and Catarina Macario a third to put Lyon 3-0 up inside 35 minutes. Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas pulled one back before the break but Lyon used their experience to manage a goal-less second half. Lyon have now won eight of the last 12 Women's Champions Leagues, but this was as warmly received as any having been eclipsed in many people's eyes by Barcelona. However Lyon, who beat Barca 4-1 in the 2019 final, did not play them in last season's competition having been knocked out by domestic rivals Paris St Germain. But they did not have Hegerberg in the team then as she was recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The Norwegian said pertinently before the final: ""There was women's football before Barcelona, and it was played here [Lyon] for years. We have to win again to regain our place in world football."" Hegerberg's recovery — she was outstanding in the final — offers hope for Carpenter if, as feared, she has also suffered an ACL injury, a common injury in women's football. The Matildas will be hoping that Carpenter's recovery will be straightforward with the FIFA Women's World Cup to be played in Australia and New Zealand beginning in July next year. Matildas and Lyon defender Ellie Carpenter opens up on her ""scary"" move abroad, the pressure of replacing a legend and what she's expecting from the Champions League final. Lyon had taken the lead when Henry won possession before scoring from 30 yards. After Jenni Hermoso had missed two good chances Hegerberg headed in Selma Bacha's cross to double the lead. Catarina Macario tapped in a Hegerberg cross with Barca in disarray before Putellas scored in the 41st minute to give them hope. Though Patri Guijarro hit the crossbar in the 58th minute from 50 yards Barcelona were unable to get the second goal which could have had Lyon worried.

36,Could there be a changing of the guard at this year's French Open?,world," Sport Teenage tennis sensation Carlos Alcaraz could signal a changing of the guard with victory at the French Open There was a time when the three certainties in life were death, taxes and Rafael Nadal winning the French Open. The Spanish bull has lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy on a record 13 occasions. Few would discount a 14th triumph but the 35-year-old has been troubled by foot and rib injuries in the past 12 months. At last year's French Open, Nadal lost an epic semi-final to the eventual champion Novak Djokovic. Since then, the exciting Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz has had a rapid rise. At the recent Madrid Open, the 19-year-old became the first player to beat modern greats Nadal and Djokovic in the same tournament on clay. Within three days, he took care of Nadal, Djokovic and then the world number three Alexander Zverev in the final. ""It's an amazing story, I don't think we've seen someone with such flair and capability and natural talent since the man that he's always revered, who is Rafa,"" commentator and former tour player Louise Pleming told ABC Sport. ""He's got power, he's got a lot of energy, and coming off his big win in Madrid, beating Nadal would've been a huge boost, beating Djokovic — I think that's a great sign."" Commentator and six-time grand slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs believes the world number six Alcaraz is headed for the top. ""There is a real chance that he can be number one in the world by the end of the year,"" Stubbs told the Court-Side with Beilinson tennis podcast. ""The key is can you mentally grasp being the best player in the world, and I think what he's just done in the last couple of months has proven to him that he can be the best player in the world."" The emergence of Alcaraz is similar to the way a 19-year-old Nadal took the tennis world by storm by winning the French Open at his first attempt in 2005. Now a wise veteran, Nadal is not surprised by the hype surrounding his young countryman. ""He's new and all the new things are much more interesting,"" Nadal said at the Italian Open earlier this month. ""When you see a new car, it always looks better, when you see a new phone, it always looks better than the old one. ""I'm happy to have someone like him from my country achieving all the things that he's achieving."" Alcaraz is coached by a man who knows how to win the French Open. Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero lifted the trophy in 2003. His pupil has won four tournaments this year and is the youngest to win the ATP events at Rio, Miami, and Madrid. ""He has no weakness in his game, zero,"" Stubbs said. ""I love the fact that he actually goes into the net a tremendous amount to finish points off. ""He moves better than any player on tour, equivalent to Novak when he was at his best, he has the splits, he can get out wide he can explosively move forward, side to side."" Djokovic himself is hitting form at the right time after beating world number four Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets in the Italian Open final. The unvaccinated world number one won't be lacking motivation after being deported from Melbourne before January's Australian Open. A triumph at Roland Garros would put the Serb back alongside Nadal for the most men's grand slam singles titles (21). ""I feel he is very much an inspired man at the moment,"" Pleming said. ""The form that he was in at Rome, he didn't drop a set there which is phenomenal. ""He's just fine tuning at the right time and I believe he's got that extra fire burning in his belly."" Alcaraz is yet to make his mark in the majors. The best performance in his fledgling career was reaching the quarter-finals of last year's US Open, when a leg injury forced his retirement in the second set against Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime. ""Is this just a little bit early for Alcaraz?"" Pleming said. ""If he plays some five-set matches early on you just wonder physically how he's going to manage that whereas Djokovic just knows how to pace himself. ""He's just got a little bit more of the mentality to last and be there on that final day."" The women's tournament will be the first grand slam since Australia's Ash Barty announced her shock retirement while ranked world number one. Iga Świątek will start the white-hot favourite. The top-ranked Pole has won five tournaments in succession. During that stretch, she's reeled off 28 wins and dropped only five sets. If Świątek is victorious at the French Open, she'll equal Venus Williams's 35 straight victories from the year 2000, which is the best winning streak by a female this century. Świątek was a surprise French Open winner in 2020, but her opponents will know all about her this time. Whether they can stop her is another matter altogether. ""Gosh that seems like the impossible mission at the moment,"" Pleming said. ""I love the way that she plays, she's really taken the baton from Ash Barty. ""She's got the variation, she's got the power, she's using her serve incredibly well but it's the mindset, that something she's borrowed from Barty as well, how to control the mind and her mentality."" Despite being only 20, Świątek has shown no signs of being overwhelmed by the pressure that comes with being expected to win a grand slam. ""For sure the expectations around are higher, but I never had a problem to cut it off and not to think about it,"" Świątek said after winning the Italian Open earlier this month. ""Also I'm gaining experience at that, with more and more tournaments it's going to get better for me to cope with all of that."" There are numerous players in the draw who have the clay court expertise to challenge for the title. World number two Barbora Krejcikova is the defending champion, while world number four Maria Sakkari made the semi-finals last year. Ons Jabeur was on an 11-match winning streak until being swept aside by Świątek in the Italian Open final. Stubbs expects the world number six from Tunisia to perform well in Paris. ""The variety of her game, she plays a little bit like Ash, she uses the slice backhand so beautifully, she has a better two hander than Ash ever did,"" Stubbs said. ""The possibility of Ons winning a grand slam is super high, she has all the shots and of course the drop shot from hell for everybody to play against."" Pleming believes Jabeur is one of the few players capable of upsetting Świątek at Roland Garros. ""It's great to see players that play differently to everybody else, they get to mix it up, they make the other players more uncomfortable than the players who play that hard-hitting aggressive game style."" Whoever wants to win the French Open is likely to face the task of overcoming a former French Open champion in irresistible form, who loves playing on the red clay at Roland Garros. ""I just can't see anyone getting past Iga,"" Pleming said. ""To win a grand slam, it makes it a whole lot easier if you know you've already done it.""

37,Aussie Jai Hindley ideally placed after show of strength in Turin,world," Sport Australia's Jai Hindley seven seconds off the lead at Giro d'Italia after stage 14, as Richard Carapaz takes the maglia rosa Simon Yates went solo in the finale to win the 14th stage of the Giro d'Italia as Richard Carapaz took over as overall race leader — but Jai Hindley is looming in second place after a brilliant tactical ride by the Australian and his team. Briton Yates, whose title ambitions had already been dashed, attacked from a group of four with four kilometres left to prevail in Turin after a 147-km ride from Santena. Hindley's Bora-Handsgrohe team had blown up the race with more than 60km to go, with a big surge led by his teammate Wilco Kelderman that fractured the group of general classification (overall) contenders. Ecuador's Carapaz, who was third on the day behind Hindley, snatched the leader's maglia rosa jersey from Juanpe Lopez after the Spaniard cracked on the penultimate ascent of the day. Former champion Vincenzo Nibali was fourth, 15 seconds down on Yates and beaten in the sprint by Hindley and Carapaz. Ineos-Grenadiers rider Carapaz, who won the 2019 Giro when riding for Movistar, attacked on the Superga climb, a five-kilometre ascent at an 8.6 per cent gradient, and Lopez lost touch to finish four minutes and 25 seconds off the pace. Carapaz was however caught by Hindley, Nibali and Yates on the final ascent to the Colle della Maddalena and he lacked a bit of juice for the decisive sprint. Hindley came through for second in the final sprint, outlasting Carapaz to take a six-second time bonus. Overall, Carapaz now leads Hindley by seven seconds, and Portugal's Joao Almeida, who took sixth place 39 seconds behind Yates, by 30 seconds. Hindley came second to Britain's Tao Geoghegan-Hart in the 2020 edition of the Giro, and the Perth-born rider is now well in the mix for another podium finish in Verona next Sunday. Tom Dumoulin, the 2017 winner, abandoned early in the stage as he was suffering from back problems. Sunday's 15th stage is a brutal 177km mountain trek from Rivarolo Cavanese to Cogne in the Aosta valley.

38,"Fearing they will disappear if they follow orders to cover their faces, female Afghan TV presenters defy Taliban",world,"  Female TV presenters defy Taliban order to cover faces on air Female presenters on Afghanistan's leading TV channels have appeared on air without covering their faces, defying a Taliban order that they conceal their appearance to comply with the group's austere brand of Islam. Since surging back to power last year the Taliban have imposed a slew of restrictions on civil society, many focused on reining in the rights of women and girls. Earlier this month Afghanistan's supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada issued a diktat for women to cover up fully in public, including their faces, ideally with the traditional burqa. The feared Ministry for Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ordered women TV presenters to follow suit by Saturday. Previously they had only been required to wear a headscarf. But broadcasters TOLOnews, Shamshad TV and 1TV all aired live programmes on Saturday with women presenters' faces visible. The Taliban promised a ""free and independent"" media, but now Afghanistan's once flourishing media sector is ""dying"" and women are paying the highest price. ""Our female colleagues are concerned that if they cover their faces, the next thing they will be told is to stop working,"" said Shamshad TV head of news Abid Ehsas. ""This is the reason they have not observed the order so far,"" he told AFP, adding the channel had requested further discussions with the Taliban on the issue. Taliban orders such as this have caused many female journalists to leave Afghanistan since the hardline Islamists stormed back to power, a woman presenter said. ""Their latest order has broken the hearts of women presenters and many now think they have no future in this country,"" she said, requesting not to be named. ""I'm thinking of leaving the country. Decrees like this will force many professionals to leave."" Many Afghan activists posted on social media in support of female presenters, condemning the order as another step toward making women ""disappear"" from society. Mohammad Sadeq Akif Mohajir, spokesman for the vice ministry, said the women presenters were violating the Taliban directive. ""If they don't comply we will talk to the managers and guardians of the presenters,"" he said. ""Anyone who lives under a particular system and government has to obey the laws and orders of that system, so they must implement the order."" The Taliban have demanded that women government employees be fired if they fail to follow the new dress code. Men working in government also risk suspension if their wives or daughters fail to comply. Mr Mohajir said media managers and the male guardians of defiant woman presenters would also be liable for penalties if the order was not observed. During two decades of US-led military intervention in Afghanistan, women and girls made marginal gains in the deeply patriarchal nation. Not all Afghan women are willing to obey the latest order from the Taliban to wear the full-length burka and veil. Soon after they took over, the Taliban promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001. Since the takeover, however, women have been banned from travelling alone and teenage girls barred from secondary schools. In the 20 years after the Taliban were ousted from office in 2001, many women in the conservative countryside continued to wear a burqa. But most Afghan women, including TV presenters, opted for the Islamic headscarf. After the Taliban takeover, television channels were ordered to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring women. Reporters and photographers were threatened, harassed, arrested and beaten for attempting to cover protests and stories that reflect negatively on the new leaders. An estimated 75 per cent of radio and television broadcasting shut down entirely after the Taliban seized control and hundreds of reporters fled the country or went into hiding.

39,A season of Survivor was being filmed when Fiji's second wave hit. The navy came to help,world,"  Survivor, Bachelor in Paradise, Love Island: How Fiji is cashing in on reality TV favourites In the office of the Fiji film commission there is a map of the 330-island archipelago and dotted across it are miniature movie posters and the very recognisable logos of some of the world's most popular reality television shows. It's a record of the productions that have been shot in Fiji and just how far their crews have ventured across the Pacific Island nation. Seasons of Survivor, Love Island, and Bachelor in Paradise as well as the films Castaway, Adrift and Blue Lagoon have all been shot in Fiji. For Fijian crews and film students, the productions are helping to develop a local industry. And for those who look after Fiji's national budget, enticing more of the global film industry to the country's shores presents a very good opportunity to put its natural assets to work. ""Fiji has a unique characteristic when it comes to that tropical location scenario,"" Films Fiji chief executive Ramiro Tenorio said. Fiji is a direct 10-hour flight from Los Angeles, with commercial flights arriving every day. From there, crews can be in locations that appear very remote on screen pretty quickly. On top of the geographical advantage, Fiji's world-famous tourism industry is experienced at housing, feeding and entertaining large groups of visitors. So some of the practical challenges that can come with running a television or film set in a remote location are made a little easier. ""Fiji has incredibly pristine locations and it's very well connected for where it is,"" Mr Tenorio said. ""It's very easy for productions to find the infrastructure that they need."" Accommodation for visitors to Fiji ranges from family resorts to luxury villas on private islands, so if you did need to house a superstar, there are options. From 2016 to 2019, Mr Tenorio estimates about 15 major productions a year were being shot in Fiji — most of them reality television. One of the original reality television shows is, of course, Survivor. The United States version of the show aired the finale of its 41st season in December, proving that even in the cutthroat television industry, it's possible to outwit, outplay and outlast. Both the 41st and 42nd seasons were filmed in Fiji throughout 2021 and were the only international productions to shoot there that year. Fiji's international border shut in March 2020, but its COVID Risk Mitigation Taskforce (CRMT) worked with Survivor to get crews safely into the country. When the Survivor crews and cast arrived, Fiji was COVID-free and had been for a year, but halfway through filming, the country experienced a deadly second wave of infections. Fijian authorities helped to keep the cameras rolling. ""A lot of rethinking had to be done very quickly on how to help them finish the show safely,"" Mr Tenorio said. ""There are a lot of logistics involved in how you move crews and equipment, not just internationally, but nationally when you have restrictions in place for the safety of the country."" The Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Health, the national COVID task force, Fiji's national airline, as well as its navy were all involved. ""They provided continuous support to the production trying to figure out the best procedures … making sure that everything was as safe as it had to be at that very high-risk moment — both when they came in, but [also] at the height of the outbreak,"" Mr Tenorio said. Mr Tenorio said the navy was very involved in helping establish a safe corridor so Survivor crews could move around and filming could continue. ""By the end of the show, they hadn't lost a single day of production,"" Mr Tenorio said. It might seem like a lot of effort for a government to go to for a reality television show, but Fiji is a small country looking for big investment. There are ambitions for the film and television sector to become ""a main pillar of the economy"", according to Mr Tenorio. He says being known as a location that will help keep productions on schedule and on budget, even in the most trying of circumstances, will work in Fiji's favour in the long run. Even in the short term, the 2021 Survivor productions made an impact. In a year when the tourism industry — a business that usually employs 150,000 people and brings in 40 per cent of Fiji's national revenue — was forced to close, the cash injection from Survivor was a welcome one. The two seasons of Survivor shot in Fiji in 2021 brought in a direct local investment of $25 million. It is estimated that for every dollar a production spends in Fiji, another $1.50 is generated simply by the engagement of local staff and businesses, eating at local restaurants and buying locally sourced items and produce. For last year's Survivor productions, 408 local staff were employed. ""That's how important one production can be,"" Mr Tenorio said. ""When you have a location that's not necessarily going through the best economic time, and then that group of villages receives a lot of investment in a very short amount of time, it's tremendously valuable."" Shooting in Fiji is also a very good deal for shows like Survivor. Attorney-General and Minister for Economy Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said despite the advantages there was still a need to lure productions to Fiji, and part of the government's effort included a significant tax rebate. ""One of the things we probably lack in Fiji is we don't have readily available post-production services, we don't have equipment. A lot of production houses need to bring it all in,"" he said. But once in Fiji, productions like Survivor are entitled to a 75 per cent tax rebate on the costs they incur locally. To get the rebate, there is a list of conditions productions have to meet. Fiji's government also needs to approve the scripts. And the film commission is conscious of keeping some of the country's most pristine beaches and secluded spots as exclusive locations, so they are careful to ensure these aren't used too often. One of the requirements for any production shooting in Fiji is that it engages with film and television students at the national university. ""We are hoping to build local capacity so [productions] don't have to bring in every member of the crew from overseas,"" Mr Sayed-Khaiyum said. And with rumours of some big-name productions heading to Fiji later this year, as well as ongoing relationships with Survivor and Bollywood producers, that puts film and television students very close to some of the world's biggest productions. ""I think there's an opportunity for producers from overseas to not only bring stories to Fiji, but also to find the stories in Fiji and help those stories be told,"" Me Tenorio said. ""I think what's incredibly interesting about this region of the planet is the unique way of looking at life, sustainability, interconnection, communal living … hopefully we see more of those stories being told soon — hopefully from Fijians.""

40,Japan claims China is trying to extract Japanese gas in East China Sea,world,"  Japan protests Beijing's extraction of undersea gas reserves in East China Sea Japan has lodged an official protest with China after discovering what it claimed were efforts by Beijing to develop gas fields in disputed waters in the East China Sea. Tokyo's foreign ministry said it had confirmed that Beijing was building in the area — where the two countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZ) overlap — and submitted a complaint to the Chinese embassy. Japan ""strongly urged an early resumption of negotiations over the implementation"" of a 2008 bilateral agreement regarding the development of resources in the East China Sea, it added. That agreement saw Japan and China agree to jointly develop undersea gas reserves in the disputed area, with a ban on independent drilling by either country. But negotiations over how to implement the deal were suspended in 2010. ""It's extremely regrettable that the Chinese side is unilaterally proceeding with development in the waters,"" the ministry said. ""The borders of the economic exclusive zones and the continental shelf are yet to be settled in the East China Sea."" Japan has long insisted the median line between the two nations should mark the limits of their respective EEZs. But China insists the border should be drawn closer to Japan, taking into account the continental shelf and other features of the ocean. Tokyo accused China of positioning 17 suspected drilling rigs close to its de facto maritime border with Japan. The rigs are on China's side of the border, but Tokyo fears gas on the Japanese side can also be extracted. The two countries are embroiled in a separate row over disputed islands elsewhere in the East China Sea. China claims the string of islands — which Japan refers to as the Senkakus — as its own, and regularly sends ships and aircraft into the area to test Tokyo's response times. China also has disputes with several other nations in the South China Sea, which it claims in its entirety.

41,'Family was torn apart': Ukraine's first lady recounts war's opening days,world,"  The first lady of Ukraine has recounted how the outbreak of the war in February caused her ""anxiety and stupor"", adding that the conflict meant that she didn't see her husband, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for two-and-a-half months. ""Our family was torn apart, as every other Ukrainian family,""  Olena Zelenska said in a televised interview with Mr Zelenskyy. ""[But] nobody takes my husband away from me, not even the war. But, yes, he lives for his job, [our family] almost don't get to see him. ""Now, we had a few occasions to see each other. And I am also very thankful for this occasion, because [this interview] makes us spend time together. ""We didn't see him at all for two-and-a-half-months. We only spoke on the phone with each other."" A successful screenwriter, Ms Zelenska married Mr Zelenskyy in 2003 and they have two children together, daughter Oleksandra and son Kyrylo. It was only the second time since the outbreak of war on February 24 that Mr Zelenskyy appeared together with his wife. During the interview, Mr Zelenskyy said the ""bloody"" war in Ukraine will only be stopped with a diplomatic solution, conceding that outright victory will be difficult to achieve. ""The victory will be difficult, it will be bloody and in battle, but its end will be in diplomacy. I am very convinced of this,"" he said. ""There are things that we can't bring to an end without sitting at the negotiation table. That's how it is, because we would like to get everything back, and Russia doesn't want to give back anything."" He said that many Ukrainian pilots operating helicopters and planes had died while transporting medication, food and water to the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol before the evacuation process started. From the battle for Snake Island to a spate of military general deaths and the devastating loss of a battalion crossing a river, Russia's mistakes on the battlefield have left Vladimir Putin in an embarrassing position. ""Many of our pilots died heroically, knowing that flying to Azovstal was almost impossible,"" he said. ""[They flew there] to bring medication, produce and water, and to evacuate the wounded. All of this was happening, details of which nobody could comment on officially."" Mr Zelenskyy added that the United Nations, the Red Cross and Russia took full responsibility for the Ukrainian servicemen brought out of the steel plant in recent days. ""As of today, yes, this process is on its finishing line, led by the [Ukrainian] intelligence service, especially the evacuation and the preparation for a dialogue and an exchange,"" he said.

42,"US, South Korea to hold bigger military drills to deter North Korea",world,"  Joe Biden and Yoon Suk-yeol agree to hold bigger military drills, deploy more US weapons President Joe Biden and his new South Korean counterpart have agreed to hold bigger military drills and deploy more US weapons if necessary to deter North Korea, while offering to send COVID-19 vaccines and potentially meet Kim Jong Un. Mr Biden and Yoon Suk-yeol said their countries' decades-old alliance needed to develop not only to face North Korean threats but to keep the Indo-Pacific region ""free and open"" and protect global supply chains. The two leaders are meeting in Seoul for their first diplomatic engagement since the South Korean president's inauguration 11 days ago. The friendly encounter between allies was clouded by intelligence showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is prepared to conduct nuclear or missile tests. Mr Yoon had sought more assurances that the United States would boost its deterrence against North Korean threats. In a joint statement, Mr Biden reaffirmed the US commitment to defend South Korea with nuclear weapons if necessary. The two sides agreed to consider expanding their combined military drills, which had been scaled back in recent years in an effort to lower tensions with the North. The United States also promised to deploy ""strategic assets"" — which typically include long-range bomber aircraft, missile submarines, or aircraft carriers — if necessary to deter North Korea, according to the statement. North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, is facing a COVID-19 crisis and a tough new adversary in the south. Both leaders said they were committed to denuclearising North Korea and were open to diplomacy with Pyongyang. ""With regard to whether I would meet with the leader of North Korea, it would depend on whether he was sincere and whether he was serious,"" Mr Biden told a joint news conference. He said Washington had offered COVID-19 vaccines to China and North Korea, which is combating its first acknowledged outbreak. ""We've got no response,"" Mr Biden said. North Korea reported more than 200,000 new patients suffering from fever for a fifth consecutive day on Saturday, but the country has little in the way of vaccines or modern treatment for the pandemic. The US-South Korea alliance, which dates to the 1950-1953 Korean War, must further develop to keep the Indo-Pacific ""free and open"", Mr Biden said. He said the alliance was built on opposition to changing borders by force — an apparent reference to Russia's war in Ukraine and China's claims over Taiwan. Changes in international trade and supply chains gave new impetus for the two countries to deepen their relationship, Mr Yoon said, calling for cooperation on electric batteries and semiconductors. Mr Biden used the visit to tout investments in the United States by Korean companies, including a move by South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group to invest about AU $7.8 billion to build its first dedicated fully electric vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities in the United States. The two leaders toured a massive Samsung semiconductor plant on Friday, where Mr Biden said countries like the United States and South Korea that ""share values"" needed to cooperate more to protect economic and national security. Mr Yoon said the concept of economic security will include cooperating in case of shocks in the foreign exchange market. The aim of the trip to Asia seemed to be applying soothing diplomatic words to relationships that had chafed under the freewheeling moves of the Trump administration, writes Carrington Clarke. The South Korean president, keen to play a bigger role in regional issues, said his country would join Mr Biden's Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which will be announced during the trip to set standards on labour, the environment and supply chains. But, given that China is South Korea's top trading partner, he struck a cautious tone in public on the topic of explicitly countering Beijing. He said on Friday that South Korea's joining the IPEF did not have to conflict with the countries' economic ties. Although White House officials have sought to play down any explicit message of countering China, it is a theme of Mr Biden's trip and one that has caught the eye of Beijing. ""We hope that the US will match its words with deeds and work with countries in the region to promote solidarity and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific, instead of plotting division and confrontation,"" Chinese envoy for Korean affairs Liu Xiaoming, said on Twitter.

43,"Tornado tears through Michigan, killing two and injuring more than 40",world,"  Rare northern Michigan tornado kills two, injures more than 40, flipping cars and tearing off roofs A rare northern Michigan tornado tore through a small community on Friday, killing at least two people and injuring more than 40 others as it flipped vehicles, tore roofs from buildings and downed trees and power lines. The twister hit Gaylord, a city of about 4,200 people roughly 370 kilometres north-west of Detroit, at around 3:45pm. Mike Klepadlo, who owns the car-repair shop Alter-Start North, said he and his workers took cover in a bathroom. ""I'm lucky I'm alive. It blew the back off the building,"" he said. ""Twenty feet [6 metres] of the back wall is gone. The whole roof is missing. At least half the building is still here. It's bad."" Emma Goddard, 15, said she was working at the Tropical Smoothie Cafe when she got a phone alert about the tornado. Thinking the weather outside looked ""stormy, but not scary,"" she dismissed it and returned to what she was doing. Her mother then called and she assured her mum she was OK. Two minutes later, she was pouring a customer's smoothie when her coworker's mother rushed in yelling for them to get to the back of the building, Ms Goddard told The Associated Press by text message. They took shelter in the walk-in cooler, where they could hear windows shattering. ""I was crammed shoulder-to-shoulder with my seven coworkers, two of my coworkers' parents and a lady from Door Dash coming to pick up her smoothies."" When they left the cooler about 15 minutes later and stepped outside, they saw ""some of our cars in pieces and insulation all over the ground,"" Ms Goddard said. Three neighbouring businesses were destroyed, she said. Brian Lawson, a spokesman for Munson Healthcare, said Otsego Memorial Hospital was treating 23 people injured by the tornado. He didn't know the conditions of the injured. The Michigan State Patrol confirmed that two people in their 70s had been killed, both residents of Nottingham Forest mobile home park. Authorities said in a tweet that more than 40 others were hurt and were being treated at area hospitals. The patrol planned to hold a briefing Saturday morning. ""I've never seen anything like this in my life,"" Mayor Todd Sharrard said. ""I'm numb."" Video posted online showed a dark funnel cloud materialise out of a cloud as nervous drivers looked on or slowly drove away, uncertain of its path. Other video showed extensive damage along the city's Main Street. One building appeared to be largely collapsed and a Goodwill store was badly damaged. A collapsed utility pole lay on the side of the road, and debris, including what appeared to be electrical wires and parts of a Marathon gas station, was scattered all along the street. The Red Cross set up a shelter at a church. Brandie Slough, 42, said she and a teen daughter sought safety in a rest room at a Culver's. Windows of the fast-food restaurant were blown out when they emerged, and her pick-up truck had been flipped on its roof in the parking lot. ""We shook our heads in disbelief but are thankful to be safe. At that point, who cares about the truck,"" Ms Slough said. Eddie Thrasher, 55, said he was sitting in his car outside an auto-parts store when the tornado seemed to appear above him. ""There are roofs ripped off businesses, a row of industrial-type warehouses,"" Mr Thrasher said. ""RVs were flipped upside down and destroyed. There were a lot of emergency vehicles heading from the east side of town."" He said he ran into the store to ride it out. ""My adrenaline was going like crazy,"" Mr Thrasher said. ""In less than five minutes it was over."" Extreme winds are uncommon in this part of Michigan because the Great Lakes suck energy out of storms, especially early in spring when the lakes are very cold, said Jim Keysor, a Gaylord-based meteorologist with the National Weather Service. ""Many kids and young adults would have never experienced any direct severe weather if they had lived in Gaylord their entire lives,"" he said. The last time Gaylord had a severe wind storm was in 1998, when straight-line winds reached 100mph, Mr Keysor said. He said the conditions that spawned Friday's twister included a cold front moving in from Wisconsin and hitting hot and humid air over Gaylord, with the added ingredient of turning winds in the lower part of the atmosphere. Governor Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Otsego County, making further state resources available to the county.

44,Russia confirms it has stopped gas exports to Finland,world,"  Russia confirms it has stopped gas exports to Finland for failing to pay in roubles Russia's Gazprom has halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland, confirming what Finnish system operator Gasgrid Finland said earlier. After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Moscow has asked clients from ""unfriendly countries"" — including EU member states — to pay for gas in roubles, a way to sidestep Western financial sanctions. Gazprom said in a statement it had ""completely stopped gas deliveries"" as it had not received rouble payments from Finland's state-owned energy company, Gasum, ""by the end of the working day on May 20"". ""Starting April 1, payments for gas need to be made in roubles using new bank details, about which the counterparts were informed in a timely manner,"" Gazprom said. Some of Europe's major economic powers still rely heavily on Russian gas to power their economies. Gazprom said it had supplied 1.49 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Finland in 2021, equal to about two-thirds of the country's gas consumption. But natural gas accounts for around eight per cent of Finland's energy. Finland said it would make up for the shortfall from other sources through the Baltic connector pipeline, which connects Finland to Estonia, and assured filling stations would run normally. Saturday's halt to gas shipments follows Moscow cutting off Poland and Bulgaria last month in a move the European Union described as ""blackmail"".

45,"For the men, women and children who have lost limbs in the war in Ukraine, their painful journey is just beginning",world,"  There is a cost to war — to the countries that wage it, to the soldiers who fight it, to the civilians who endure it. For nations, territory is gained and lost, and sometimes regained and lost again. But some losses are permanent. Lives lost can never be regained. Nor can limbs — and so it is in Ukraine. Warning: This story contains graphic details and imagery. The stories of the people who undergo amputations during conflict are as varied as their wounds, as are their journeys of reconciliation with their injuries. For some, losing a part of their body can be akin to a death of sorts — coming to terms with it, a type of rebirth. For soldiers wounded while defending their country, their sense of purpose and belief in the cause they were fighting for can sometimes help them cope, psychologically, with amputation. For some civilians, maimed while going about their lives in a war that already terrified them, the struggle can be much harder. For the men, women and children who have lost limbs in the war in Ukraine, now in its third month, that journey is just beginning. The explosion that took Olena Viter's left leg also took her son, 14-year-old Ivan, a budding musician. Her husband, Volodymyr, buried him, along with another boy killed in the same blast, under a rose bush in their garden. Amid the fighting, they couldn't get to the cemetery. ""How am I going to live without Ivan? He will remain in my heart forever, like the fragment that hit him,"" she said. When she's alone, Olena, 45, cries. Bombs rained down on Olena's village of Rozvazhiv, in the Kyiv region, on March 14. Ivan and four others died. Olena was one of about 20 people who were wounded. Her soft voice breaking, Olena says, at first, she was thinking: ""Why did God leave me alive?'"" Hearing Ivan that was dead, she begged a neighbour to get his rifle and shoot her. But Volodymyr pleaded with her, saying he couldn't live without her. Now, she endures the devastation of the loss of her child plus the physical pain of the loss of her leg, cut off below the knee. ""Every day I get used to some new type of pain. I am thinking: 'What kind of new pain will I see in the future?'"" She has yet to accept either of her losses. ""I am still not accepting myself as I am now,"" Olena said. ""I really liked to dance. I was doing sports. I don't know. I need to learn."" She can't yet imagine what it will be like to walk again. Perhaps, Olena said, her life was spared because she was meant to do something: to help others, perhaps as a volunteer or by donations to a music school in Ivan's memory. ""At the moment, I don't know what I would want to do. I should keep searching … I must learn how to live. How? I do not know yet."" Devastation struck out of a clear blue sky for Yana Stepanenko. On April 8, the 11-year-old went to the eastern city of Kramatorsk with her mother, Natasha, and twin brother Yarik to board an evacuation train. Yarik stayed in the station to guard their luggage while Yana and her mother went outside to buy tea. A missile hit, and the world went black, and silent. Natasha fell. She couldn't stand. She looked over and saw her little girl, her leggings dangling where her feet should be. Blood was everywhere. ""Mum, I'm dying,"" Yana cried. The injuries to mother and daughter were devastating. Yana lost two legs, one just above the ankle, the other higher up her shin. Natasha lost her left leg below the knee. Yarik was uninjured and has been reunited with his mother and sister. The children's father died of cancer several years ago, and their stepfather is fighting at the front. So now the little boy cares for his mother and sister, running around the hospital corridors, fetching wheelchairs and bringing food. Natasha still struggles to comprehend what happened. ""Sometimes it seems like it happened not to us,"" she said, crying softly. She worries most about her daughter. ""I cannot help her as a mother, I cannot pick her up, or help her move,"" she said. ""I can only support her with my words from my bed."" Yana, like children everywhere, is eager to be up and about. She misses her home and her friends and is looking forward to getting prosthetics. ""I really do want to run,"" Yana said. Alexander Horokhivskyi, known as Sasha, is in pain. And he is angry. He winces as he rubs the stump of his left thigh where his leg was amputated on April 4, nearly two weeks after he was injured. Sasha was shot in the calf by his own side. A territorial defence member mistook him for a spy because he was snapping photos of bombed buildings near his home in Bobrovytsya, a city in the Chernihiv region, after emerging from a bomb shelter. He was questioned for about 90 minutes at a police station before being taken to an overwhelmed hospital. Days later, he was moved to a hospital in the capital, Kyiv, where doctors decided they had to take his leg to save his life. The 38-year-old, an avid table tennis player, only found out about the amputation when he awoke from surgery. ""How did they dare do all that without my consent?"" he railed. Between the drugs and the pain, he doesn't remember much. ""I swore a lot."" His journey has been painful, both physically and psychologically. He worries whether he'll be able to play sport again, or travel. And the injustice of it all weighs on him. ""I try to understand how it could happen. Especially during the first week, I couldn't think about anything else."" It would be different, he said, if he was wounded while fighting. ""But to be injured in such a way was very hard."" Still, he's spoken with a psychologist, and he's come a long way from those initial dark days. ""It does not make sense to return to this moment,"" he said. ""Because you can't change anything."" There had been no electricity or running water for two or three days in the Chernihiv basement where Nastia Kuzik, her parents, her brother and another 120 people had taken shelter. Tired of the dark, she decided to go to her brother's house nearby — just for a while. Walking back toward the bomb shelter, the 21-year-old heard the noise: ""Tsch, tsch, tsch."" She ran. She was just a few steps from the entrance when the explosion flung her to the ground. Then she drifted in and out of consciousness. Every time she opened her eyes, her brother was there, telling her everything would be OK. But nothing would ever be the same. Doctors worked hard to save her leg, but it just wasn't possible. Her lower right leg was amputated below the knee. Her other leg was badly broken. Now, gradually, as she goes through painful physical therapy, reality is sinking in. ""I am accepting it,"" she said. Nastia's usually bright, cheerful disposition falters. A tear runs down her cheek. ""I had never thought it would ever happen to me. But since it did, what can I do?"" She's working hard to be optimistic. A German speaker, she has tutored children in the language, and she's always wanted to study in Germany. In early May, she was evacuated to a specialised rehabilitation facility in Leipzig. This was not the way she wanted her dream to come true, but she said she's going to make the most of it. Lidiya Gladun had lost contact with 22-year-old Anton, a military medic deployed on the front lines in eastern Ukraine, for about three weeks. Then someone sent her a Facebook post by a nurse in a hospital in Kharkiv. They had an Anton Gladun in their hospital. Did anybody know him? Lidiya contacted the nurse, who was sparing with information on Anton's condition. When he was well enough to do so, Anton phoned his mother. He asked her to bring some clothes to the hospital. ""He was mentioning flip-flops, and then he said he didn't need flip-flops anymore."" He believes it was a cluster bomb that struck his unit as the Russian military retreated on March 27. Anton lost both legs and his left arm, and his right arm was injured. For days, Anton had been in a coma. When he regained consciousness, he said, ""I was smiling, like everything was OK, basically. ""I was thinking that the most important thing was that I was alive."" But he was haunted by nightmares and horrific hallucinations. A volunteer psychologist visited him and, with his help, the hallucinations subsided. He no longer has nightmares. He doesn't really dream at all. He is eager to get his prosthetics and start walking. He figures his military career is probably over, but he wants to study information technology. What helps, he said, ""is my understanding that, if I would be sad, would cry because of what happened, then it would only be worse"". AP EDITOR'S NOTE — AP photojournalist Emilio Morenatti lost his left leg while covering the conflict in Afghanistan in 2009. ""When a part of your body is amputated, you cross over into the disabled community, and a camaraderie inevitably develops,"" he said. ""My need to access this group is above any kind of impediment: I'm fascinated by comparing experiences, amputee to amputee. This is why I'm no longer interested in covering the war from the front line, but rather from behind the front lines, where the only thing that remains is the raw testimony of the cruelty marked by this damned war.""

46,Russian soldier in Ukraine war crimes trial says he killed an unarmed civilian after refusing the order twice,world,"  A 21-year-old Russian soldier says he had not wanted to kill an unarmed civilian and he sincerely repented, in his final words at the first war crimes trial arising from Russia's February 24 invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, a tank commander, pleaded guilty to killing Oleksandr Shelipov, a 62-year-old civilian, in the north-east Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on February 28. ""I sincerely repent. I was nervous at the time, I did not want to kill … that's how it happened,"" Shishimarin told the court in Kyiv. Shishimarin is accused of firing several shots with an assault rifle at a civilian's head from a car after being ordered to do so. Defence lawyer Viktor Ovsiannikov told the court that Shishimarin had only fired the rounds after twice refusing to carry out the order to shoot and that only one out of three-to-four rounds hit the target. He said that Shishimarin had fired the rounds out of fear for his own safety and questioned whether the defendant had intended to kill. ""He was sitting at the window of a car … the car was moving at high speed with a punctured tyre,"" Mr Ovsiannikov said. ""I conclude that Shishimarin fired aimless shots and did not intend to kill the civilian, and that he carried out the order not with the aim of killing the person, but formally, with the hope that [the rounds] would not hit,"" he said. He said: ""I personally think that it should not be this young man in the dock, but the senior leadership of the other country that I think is guilty of unleashing this war."" A new Human Rights Watch report documents claims of torture, summary execution and other abuses of civilians by Russian forces in north-eastern Ukraine. State prosecutor Andriy Synyuk said the arguments did not change the essence of the case. ""The court will analyse all the evidence and announce its decision. The defence's arguments in no way refute what we have given and do not refute … the guilt of Shishimarin himself,"" the prosecutor said. The judge may hand down a verdict on Monday when the court next convenes. The state prosecutor asked the court to sentence Shishimarin to life in prison. Ukraine accuses Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians during the invasion and says it has identified more than 10,000 possible war crimes. Russia denies targeting civilians or involvement in war crimes. The Kremlin said it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide assistance.

47,Cameron Smith accidentally strikes opponent as Aussie's US PGA hopes dwindle,world," Sport Cameron Smith accidentally hits opponent on nearby hole as Australian hopes fade at US PGA Championship Cameron Smith has let the leaders slip away in an opportunity lost at the US PGA Championship in Oklahoma. Smith remains an outside chance but will need to defy history after labouring to a second-round even-par 70 at Southern Hills Country Club on Saturday. Australia's world number four is two-under for the Championship, seven shots adrift of American pacesetter Will Zalatoris, after failing to take advantage of a favourable change in conditions. As his rivals cashed in on a dramatic wind shift mid-round with a barrage of birdies, Smith went backwards with two bogeys on his homeward nine to leave himself playing catch-up over the weekend. Bogeys on the 10th, when he missed the green left, and on number 15, after leaving his bunker shot in the trap, sent Smith tumbling from fifth into a log-jam of players sharing ninth spot. Smith's round was not helped by a wild tee shot that he sailed onto an adjacent hole, accidentally striking Aaron Wise of the USA on the head. History favours the frontrunners at Southern Hills, with all seven winners of the previous seven PGA Championships played at the venue having at least a share of the 36-hole lead. That leaves Zalatoris in the box seat to hoist the Wanamaker Trophy on Sunday after the 2021 Masters runner-up shot to nine under with a sizzling 65. Chilean Mito Pereira (64) is one shot behind after missing a short birdie putt on the last to tie the course record jointly held by Tiger Woods and Raymond Floyd. Woods, for his part, made the cut with a one-under-par 69 in the second round, 15 months after nearly losing his right leg in a car accident. He moves to three over four the tournament thanks to four birdies on Saturday. Chasing a second PGA Championship triumph, Justin Thomas is third at six-under after posting a successive 67, this time in the fierce morning winds. Smith's fellow Australians Lucas Herbert, Jason Day, and Marc Leishman also made the halfway cut, but will be making up the numbers. Herbert also lost ground on Saturday, falling to one over for the championship with a three-over 73. Day, champion in 2015 and runner-up in 2016, fought hard to pull back to even with the card, only to finish his second-round 72 with three straight bogeys to slip to three over — a dozen strokes adrift of Zalatori. Leishman (71) is also three over, while Cam Davis (72) birdied his last two holes to make the cut on the number at four over. Min Woo Lee (72) at five over and Adam Scott (70) at seven over missed the cut. Meanwhile, Australian Whitney Hillier has snatched the lead heading into the final round of the Ladies European Tour event at Evian Resort Golf Club this weekend. Fresh off a team win at the Aramco Series in Bangkok, Hillier posted a level par round of 71 for a 36-hole total of four-under-par, which included a sensational hole-in-one on the eighth to complement the hole in one she sunk yesterday on a course where two others achieved the feat on the same day. Hillier now holds a one-stroke lead as she looks to clinch her maiden singles victory.

48,Ancient gold ring decorated with two sphinxes returned to Greece after WWII theft,world,"  Ancient gold ring decorated with two sphinxes returned to Greece after World War II theft A more than 3,000-year-old gold signet ring that was stolen from an Aegean island during World War II has found its way back to Greece. After its theft, the artefact crossed the Atlantic, was bought by a Nobel prize-winning Hungarian scientist and ended up in a Swedish museum before its eventual return to a museum in Greece. It marks the latest in a series of coups by Greek authorities seeking the return of works plundered from the antiquities-rich country — even though an initial effort by the Swedish museum to return the ring apparently fell between the cracks of 1970s bureaucracy. The Greek culture ministry said on Friday that the gold Mycenaean-era work from Rhodes, decorated with two facing sphinxes, was willingly returned by Swedish officials who provided full assistance with documenting the artefact and its provenance. Greek experts confirmed the identification, and the piece was handed over in Stockholm by Vidar Helgesen, executive director of the Nobel Foundation, to which the ring had been bequeathed by the Hungarian biophysicist. The foundation, which presents annual awards for outstanding achievement in several fields, had given it to the Museum of Mediterranean and Near Eastern Antiquities in Stockholm. Greek Culture Minister Lina Mendoni thanked the Nobel Foundation and Swedish authorities for the repatriation, saying it showed ""their respect for modern Greece and our constant efforts to fight the illegal trafficking of cultural goods"". The ring, which would have once been a status symbol for a local nobleman, was discovered in 1927 by Italian archaeologists in a Mycenaean grave near the ancient city of Ialysos on Rhodes. The south-eastern Aegean island belonged to Italy until it was incorporated into Greece after World War II. The Ministry of Culture and Sports said the ring was stolen from a museum on Rhodes during the war — with hundreds of other pieces of jewellery and coins that remain missing — and surfaced in the United States. It was brought to the US during the 1950s or 1960s by Georg von Békésy, a biophysicist and art collector whose collection was donated to the Nobel Foundation after his 1972 death and from there distributed to several museums. The Nobel Foundation's Mr Helgesen said there was no doubt where the ring belonged. ""To us, it was obvious that the ring should be returned,"" he said. ""This artefact is of very great cultural-historical value for Greece."" The Stockholm museum had initially identified the ring from Ialysos in 1975 and contacted Greek authorities, the ministry said. ""But it remained in Stockholm for reasons that are not clear from existing archives,"" Friday's statement said. The ring will now be displayed in a museum on Rhodes.

49,'It's the next level': Ellie Carpenter grew up in the spotlight — now she's basking in it,world,"  Matildas and Lyon star Ellie Carpenter opens up on fear, family and the future ahead of her second Champions League final Ellie Carpenter is dawdling along a beach somewhere in Dubai. She's dressed casually in a white T-shirt that reads ""Peace Through Practice"" and a pair of comfy green shorts. Her iconic, white-blonde hair hangs loosely behind her shoulders, a pink hair-tie wrapped around her wrist. She sways gently as she walks, answering fun, light questions about herself for a quick-fire interview: her favourite time of day, three things she can't live without, what makes her smile. Asked to describe herself in one word, she says ""bubbly"" before giggling into the next question. This sunny, care-free young woman stands in stark contrast to the Ellie Carpenter football fans often see on the field: a right-back who is uncompromising, fearless and daring beyond her years. Now Carpenter is on the verge of achieving something no other Australian footballer has done: winning two Champions League finals when her French club, Olympique Lyonnais, take on reigning champions Barcelona on Sunday morning. Looking at her life from the outside, it's hard to believe she has only just turned 22. On the inside, Carpenter can hardly believe it, either. Trying to figure out how to play football at the highest possible level is one thing, but trying to figure out who you are and how you fit into the world at the same time is quite another. ""I've had to grow up very quickly,"" Carpenter told ABC from her home in Lyon. ""I didn't have a normal teenager kind of life. I went straight from leaving school [at 17] and into a national team with girls so much older than me, so I kind of missed that stage in my life: being a kid, being a teenager, doing those kinds of things. ""It has been hard. I've been away from home since I was 15. And, thinking now, I just turned 22, and it feels like I've been doing this for so long. Sometimes I forget how young I am. ""It's funny because a lot of people around me at the club here, they still can't believe my age. So they think I must be mature, which is nice. ""Honestly, when I think about everything I've done already, it's really crazy. But I do want to achieve more and keep growing as a footballer and as a person as well. It's been quite the journey already."" It certainly has. For a player so young, Carpenter has already lived a robust footballing life. Growing up on a farm in the small town of Cowra in central New South Wales, Carpenter played with and against boys until she was 12 before her family relocated to Sydney to find her better opportunities. Three years later, while still studying at Westfield Sports High School, she made her professional debut with Western Sydney Wanderers in the 2015-16 W-League season, starting every single game. Even back then, you could see the raw materials of what Carpenter has been forged and sharpened into now: the natural athleticism, the one-on-one physicality, the desire to gallop forward and help attack, the ferocious dedication in defence. She was the archetypal modern full-back before she knew it. It was the spark that got her noticed by then-Matildas coach Alen Stajcic, who handed her a senior national team debut against Vietnam in 2016, becoming the first Australian footballer born in the 2000s to pull on the green-and-gold. Four months later, at 16 years of age, she became the youngest Australian competitor at the Rio Olympics, as well as the youngest-ever woman footballer to compete at the Games in its history. She followed up these age-based milestones at club level, too, becoming the youngest player to appear in America's National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) when she debuted with Portland Thorns, aged 18, in 2018, as well as their youngest-ever goal-scorer when she netted for them 10 days later. A stand-out season back in Australia with Melbourne City resulted in one of the biggest moves for an Australian woman footballer when she was signed by seven-times Champions League winners Lyon in 2020. Carpenter's life has come at her fast. She didn't get to experience the regular stuff that most of us do as we try to figure out who we are or what we want our lives to look like. She admits that — even though she had to skip that awkward, stumbling teenaged chapter — she still felt a child-like fear when the big European move beckoned. ""The most scared I've been was this move to Lyon,"" she said. ""It's obviously such a big club. You don't know what to expect. You don't know how the team is going to be: the language, the culture. ""It was a lot of pressure signing here. Lucy Bronze was here before me as well — she was leaving and people were like, 'Oh, is she going to fill her shoes?' ""But the transition into this team and into France is the easiest transition I've had to do anywhere. It's the nicest team I've  been part of, the most welcoming team I've been in. I was so surprised. ""After a week or so, I could be myself. And I really appreciated that … it's an environment that makes you thrive and makes the best come out in yourself because you feel comfortable on and off the pitch."" It helps that she's not the odd foreigner out: Several of her team-mates — such as Catarina Macario, Christiane Endler, Tokyo gold medallist Kadeisha Buchanan and Ballon D'Or winner Ada Hegerberg — come from elsewhere in the world, too. They all share a group chat and meet up regularly outside of football, exploring the city that's famous for its food and its history: They've become her second family. But what glues the team together is arguably its French veterans, anchored by captain Wendie Renard, midfielder Amandine Henry, winger Amel Majri and striker Eugenie Le Sommer. They've formed the foundation of this all-conquering women's club — the most successful in women's football — and continue to set the tone and standards for newcomers like Carpenter, who has since become a starter in the side. ""First, coming into the team, I was scared of them,"" Carpenter laughs. ""But, honestly, they're so nice. They help you with anything. ""I've learned a lot from them, with their experiences. Some of them have won eight Champions Leagues … like, that's incredible. ""Wendie just played 100 Champions League games. So, to have them on the pitch with you — all the time, learning from them, seeing how they cope in situations of pressure — it's so nice to have them and know they have your back as well. ""Everyone's so professional here, some of the most professional I've seen. ""Coming from previous clubs and seeing what everyone does here, it's like, 'Oh, OK, this is why you guys win everything. This is why you're so good.' ""It's the next level here, but it's nice to be exposed to that, for me to see that so young so I can follow in their footsteps."" It's this environment that has made Carpenter more ready than ever for the biggest game of her career: Sunday morning's Champions League final against holders Barcelona, who continue to topple records after winning every game of their most recent league while also repeatedly attracting more than 90,000 fans to their home games. However, the intensity and pressure of Carpenter's daily life has moulded her into the fierce, mature competitor she always knew she could be, to the point where she is barely even bothered by the occasion now. ""For me, it's just another normal game,"" she shrugs casually. ""I haven't really thought about it. I don't really put it up above any other game or think that I'm going to do something different. ""Obviously it's a bigger stage and a bigger atmosphere, but these are the games we live for and you want to play for. ""When we walked out [against PSG in the semi-final], at the sold-out Parc de Princes stadium, they were all PSG supporters and everyone's going nuts. When we scored, the stadium was just silent. It was so cool — probably one of the coolest games I've played in my career. ""I love the pressure. It makes me perform better. It really makes you get the best out of yourself, and that's one thing that, when I came here, I knew was going to be the hardest thing: to perform when you're supposed to and not crumble. ""I've handled that well — now, it's just kind of normal. ""It's going to be an amazing game. Hopefully we can win."" The bubbly young footballer from Cowra has grown up in the footballing spotlight.

50,"FA investigating Palace manager Patrick Vieira after fan altercation, pitch invasion",world,"  English FA investigating Crystal Palace manager after pitch invasion, altercation with fan The English Football Association is investigating all incidents of fans invading the field and has condemned the ""anti-social behaviour"" as completely unacceptable. The FA's statement came after Everton fans invaded the pitch at Goodison Park following Dominic Calvert-Lewin's 85th-minute winner at the final whistle of Thursday's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace, which secured the side's spot in the Premier League next season. Palace manager Patrick Vieira was also involved in an altercation with a fan when he was walking towards the away dressing room after the final whistle. The fan appeared to provoke Vieira with hand gestures, after which Vieira kicked him to the ground and had to be led away by other supporters. ""We are very concerned about the rise in anti-social behaviour from fans as we reach the end of the season,"" the FA said on Friday. ""Football stadiums should always be a safe and enjoyable space for everyone, and these incidents are completely unacceptable and have no place in our game. ""It is illegal to enter the pitch area in any stadium and these actions are putting players, fans and people who run the game at great risk. This simply cannot continue and we can confirm that we are investigating all of the incidences."" The FA said clubs needed to prevent pitch invasions from occurring and urged them to take their own action against those who broke the rules and the law. ""The FA will be seeking to do all that it can to work with clubs as well as addressing the issues from a disciplinary perspective,"" the statement added. West Ham United manager David Moyes said such incidents had been an ""issue"", while Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said pitch invaders posed a danger to players and staff. ""We have to stop it and we have to minimise the risk and exposure of players and staff in this situation because you cannot control,"" he said. ""When there are so many people involved it becomes dangerous."" Vieira, who has been nominated for Premier League manager of the season, declined to comment after the match. There have also been a number pitch invasions in England's lower leagues in recent weeks. Nottinghamshire Police said a man was arrested and interviewed on suspicion of assault as part of an investigation into video footage showing an incident during Tuesday's Championship play-off semifinal between Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United. Police did not provide details of the incident but a video on social media showed United striker Oli McBurnie, wearing a surgical boot, appearing to stamp on a fan on the ground during a pitch invasion after Forest won on penalties at the City Ground. A Forest fan who headbutted United captain Billy Sharp during the pitch invasion was jailed for 24 weeks and handed a 10-year football banning order on Thursday. Swindon Town manager Ben Garner said his players were ""physically and verbally abused"" after their League Two play-off semifinal defeat by Port Vale. Swindon were beaten 6-5 on penalties by Vale, whose fans invaded the pitch after the last penalty, and television footage appeared to show some in an altercation with Swindon players.

51,Russia claims to have taken full control of Ukrainian port city of Mariupol,world,"  Russia claims to have captured Mariupol following a nearly three-month siege that has reduced much of the strategic port city to a smoking ruin and left more than 20,000 civilians feared dead. The capture of the city would be Russia's biggest victory yet in its war with Ukraine. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukraine. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Vladimir Putin the ""complete liberation"" of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol — the last stronghold of Ukrainian resistance — and the city as a whole, spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the ministry as saying 2,439 Ukrainian fighters who had been holed up at Azovstal had surrendered since Monday, including more than 500 on Friday. The steelworks had been the site of fierce fighting for weeks. The dwindling group of outgunned fighters had held out in the plant, drawing Russian air strikes, artillery and tank fire before the Ukrainian government ordered them to abandon the site's defence and save their lives. The complete takeover of Mariupol gives Moscow a badly needed military victory in the war it began on February 24 — a conflict that was supposed to have been a quick and easy victory for the Kremlin but instead has seen its failure to take the capital of Kyiv, a pullback of its forces to refocus on battles in eastern Ukraine, and even the sinking of the Moskva — the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet. From the battle for Snake Island to a spate of military general deaths and the devastating loss of a battalion crossing a river, Russia's mistakes on the battlefield have left Vladimir Putin in an embarrassing position. Military analysts say the city's capture at this point holds more symbolic importance than anything else, since Mariupol is already effectively under Moscow's control and most of the Russian forces tied down by the drawn-out fighting have already left. Russia had sought control of Mariupol, on the coast of the Sea of Azov, to complete a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to join the growing battle for control of the wider industrial Donbas region, home to an eight-year-old Moscow-backed separatist rebellion. It would also deprive Ukraine of a vital port. The city's residents have endured some of the worst suffering of the war. An estimated 100,000 people, from a pre-war population of 450,000, remain there. Many are trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Constant bombardment has left behind shattered and charred buildings in row after row of destroyed apartment blocks and ruined neighbourhoods. A maternity hospital was hit with a lethal Russian air strike on March 9, producing searing images of pregnant women being evacuated from the facility. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in a bombing of a theatre where civilians were taking shelter, although the real death toll could be closer to 600. Officials had written the word ""CHILDREN"" in Russian on the ground outside in a bid to prevent an aerial attack. Long traffic jams of cars snaked out of the city, filled with evacuees fleeing past checkpoints of Russian soldiers with heavy weapons who did not have time to search inside each vehicle in the convoys. New satellite images appear to show more than 200 new graves at a cemetery in the Ukrainian town of Manhush near Mariupol. Satellite images in April showed what appeared to be mass graves near Mariupol, where local officials accused Russia of concealing the slaughter by burying up to 9,000 civilians. The imagery showed rows of graves stretching away from an existing cemetery in the town of Manhush, outside the port city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of ""hiding their military crimes"" in the mass graves and labelled it ""the new Babi Yar"" — recalling the ravine in Kyiv where the Nazis massacred nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews during World War II. This is not the first time Moscow has claimed to have captured Mariupol. At a joint appearance with his Defence Minister on April 21, Mr Putin declared ""the completion of combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success"". Even though die-hard Ukrainian forces were still inside the Azovstal plant at that point, Mr Putin ordered the military to seal off the complex ""so that not even a fly comes through"". After continued bombardment, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on May 16 the evacuation of his forces from the bunkers and tunnels beneath Azovstal was done to save the lives of the fighters. ""Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes to be alive. It's our principle,"" Mr Zelenskyy said. The Azovstal complex covers 11 square kilometres and is threaded with about 24 kilometres of tunnels and bunkers. Earlier in May, hundreds of civilians were evacuated from the plant during humanitarian ceasefires. One civilian evacuee from Azovstal, who made it to the Ukrainian controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on May 3, said she went to sleep at the plant every night afraid she would not wake up. Five storeys below the besieged Azovstal steelworks, Ukrainian soldiers told Nataliya Babeush she had a few minutes to prepare to leave the underground bunker she called home for more than two months. This is the story of her survival and escape. ""You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the bomb shelter, in a damp and wet basement, and it is bouncing and shaking,"" Elina Tsybulchenko, 54, said. While Russia described the troops leaving the steel plant as a mass surrender, the Ukrainians called it a fulfilled mission. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Mr Zelenskyy, described the defence of Mariupol as ""the Thermopylae of the 21st century"" — a reference to the site where 300 Spartans held off a much larger Persian force in 480 BC before finally succumbing. ""The Azovstal defenders thwarted the enemy's plans to seize eastern Ukraine, drew away enormous numbers of enemy forces, and changed the course of the war,"" Mr Podolyak said. Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Mariupol's defenders gave Ukraine ""critically important time to form reserves and regroup forces and receive help from partners. And they fulfilled all their tasks"". AP We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

52,Wimbledon stripped of ranking points for banning Russian and Belarussian athletes,world,"  Wimbledon stripped of ranking points by ATP and WTA for banning Russian and Belarusian athletes The ATP and WTA have stripped Wimbledon of its ranking points over its decision to exclude players from Russia and Belarus at this year's championships due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The tennis governing bodies had banned Russia and Belarus from international team competitions following the invasion, but they have allowed players from the two countries to compete as neutrals. But Wimbledon has gone one step further and banned the athletes outright, prompting the ATP and WTA tours to strip the grand slam of its ranking points, which effectively reduces the world's most famous tennis tournament to an exhibition event. ""The ability for players of any nationality to enter tournaments based on merit, and without discrimination, is fundamental to our Tour,"" the ATP said in a statement. ""The decision by Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer undermines this principle and the integrity of the ATP Ranking system. It is also inconsistent with our Rankings agreement. ""Absent a change in circumstances, it is with great regret and reluctance that we see no option but to remove ATP Ranking points from Wimbledon for 2022."" WTA chief Steve Simon said athletes participating in an individual sport ""should not be penalised or prevented from competing solely because of their nationalities or the decisions made by the governments of their countries"". ""The recent decisions made by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to ban athletes from competing in the upcoming UK grass court events violate that fundamental principle,"" Simon said. ""As a result of the AELTC's position that it will not honour its obligation to use the WTA rankings for entry into Wimbledon and proceed with a partial field not based on merit, the WTA has made the difficult decision to not award WTA ranking points for this year's Wimbledon Championships."" The move by the AELTC, the organiser of the grass-court grand slam, is the first time players have been banned on grounds of nationality since the immediate post-World War II era when German and Japanese players were excluded. The AELTC has previously said the ban on Russian and Belarusian players was its only viable option under the guidance provided by the British government. On Friday, the AELTC reiterated its stance, adding it was considering its options and was in discussions with its grand slam colleagues. ""In addition, we remain unwilling to accept success or participation at Wimbledon being used to benefit the propaganda machine of the Russian regime,"" the AELTC said in a statement. ""We therefore wish to state our deep disappointment at the decisions taken by the ATP, WTA and ITF in removing ranking points for The Championships. ""We believe these decisions to be disproportionate in the context of the exceptional and extreme circumstances of this situation and the position we found ourselves in, and damaging to all players who compete on Tour."" Wimbledon's ban on Russian and Belarusian players has been slammed by top players such as 21-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal who labelled it unfair, and world number one Novak Djokovic, who said he did not support the decision. ""Our rules and agreements exist in order to protect the rights of players as a whole. Unilateral decisions of this nature, if unaddressed, set a damaging precedent for the rest of the tour,"" the ATP added. ""Discrimination by individual tournaments is simply not viable on a tour that operates in more than 30 countries. ""We remain hopeful of further discussions with Wimbledon leading to an acceptable outcome for all concerned. ""More broadly, we believe this matter again highlights the need for a united governance structure across professional tennis so that decisions of this nature can be made in a joint manner."" While Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) reciprocated the Wimbledon ban by excluding players from the two countries from its tune-up tour events, its decision is still under review by the ATP and WTA and also faces potential sanctions. Meanwhile, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said it would not grant ranking points to Wimbledon this year for junior and wheelchair tennis events. ""The ITF has determined that Wimbledon's entry criteria banning Russians and Belarusians compromises the integrity of its international competition, in particular its ranking system, as there is a lack of alternative equivalent opportunities for players to compete for ranking points and prize money,"" the ITF said.

53,Russia says troops close to claiming full control of Luhansk,world,"  Moscow has almost taken full control of Ukraine’s south-eastern region of Luhansk, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu says. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces had launched a massive artillery bombardment against Sievierodonetsk, one of the last Ukrainian-held bastions in Luhansk. Days before invading Ukraine on February 24,  Russia recognised Luhansk and neighbouring Donetsk — which make up the Donbas region — as ""independent"". Pro-Russian separatists have controlled about a third of the region since 2014 and Moscow has said it will ""liberate"" the remaining Kyiv-controlled areas. ""The liberation of the Luhansk People's Republic is nearing completion,"" Mr Shoigu said in a televised ministry meeting. Russian troops bombarded the riverside city of Lyshchansk on Friday in what appeared to herald a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in the province. Despite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front, in what some military analysts view as a major push to achieve scaled-down war aims of capturing all territory claimed by pro-Russian rebels. In an overnight address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the conditions in Donbas as ""hell"", saying the region had been ""completely destroyed"" by Russia's invasion. Nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fighters who had held out inside Mariupol's pulverised steel plant have surrendered after a battle that turned the city into a worldwide symbol of defiance and suffering. Meanwhile, the Russian Defence Minister said moves by Finland and Sweden to join NATO were part of a growing military threat near Russia's western borders, and the country was taking ""adequate countermeasures"". In a speech, Mr Shoigu also said the United States had stepped up strategic bomber flights in recent years, sent warships to the Baltic Sea and intensified training exercises in the region with its NATO partners. He said Russia would respond by forming new military units and divisions along its western border, and it was working to improve the combat strength of its troops. “By the end of the year, 12 military units and divisions will be established in the western military district,"" he said. ""This will be accompanied by a surge in military equipment and weapons."" Finland and Sweden formally applied to join NATO on Wednesday. Finland shares a 1,340-kilometre land border with Russia, while Sweden shares a maritime boundary. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Swedish and Finnish NATO membership posed no threat to Russia, but cautioned that Moscow would respond if the alliance boosted military infrastructure in the two countries. Russia's Gazprom informed Finland it would halt flows of natural gas from Saturday morning, Gasum said on Friday, after the Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler refused to pay its Russian supplier in roubles. Gazprom Export has demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Most supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars. Moscow has already cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland in response to them refusing to comply with the new payment terms. The majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia but gas only accounts for about 5 per cent of its annual energy consumption. ""It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted,"" Gasum chief executive Mika Wiljanen said in a statement. ""However, we have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months."" Germany and Qatar signed an agreement on Friday to deepen their cooperation on energy, as Berlin seeks to diversify its gas supplies and ultimately stop using Russian gas. A celebrated Ukrainian medic recorded her time in Mariupol on a data card no bigger than a thumbnail and smuggled it out to the world in a tampon. Now she is in Russian hands, at a time when Mariupol itself is on the verge of falling. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a news conference alongside Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani that energy security played ""a very central role"" for Germany. Mr Scholz said Qatar would be key as Germany developed its infrastructure moving forward. Germany plans to build two liquefied natural gas terminals to bring in gas from suppliers like Qatar. ""We understand now the energy security is very important, and gas is playing a very vital role, and it's going to be very important for the transition period as well,"" the Qatari emir said without providing figures.

54,Why is Indonesia's President hanging out with 'super genius' Elon Musk?,world,"  Why is Indonesia's President Joko Widodo hanging out with Elon Musk? Indonesia's President Joko Widodo visited Washington last weekend along with other South-East Asian leaders, as his US counterpart Joe Biden seeks to court the region against growing Chinese influence. But it was a trip to the small town of Boca Chica, Texas, that attracted more attention back home in Indonesia. Mr Widodo had lined up a high-profile meeting with Tesla and Space X founder Elon Musk at the private space agency's headquarters, where he was given a private tour. As Mr Widodo praised the tech baron as a ""super genius"", Mr Musk declared he was ""very interested"" in the future of Indonesia, a country of 270 million people. The world's richest man also said the country exuded ""positive energy"". ""We're going to look, from a Tesla and Space X standpoint, to try and do some partnerships in Indonesia,"" Mr Musk said, flagging ""future collaboration on many fronts"". Indonesia, South-East Asia's largest economy, seeks to cash in on the global transition to electric vehicles (EVs) by luring foreign investment from the likes of Mr Musk. Nickel is a key component of lithium-ion battery cells, which are used in most EVs. So demand for the metal is rapidly increasing. Australia has the critical minerals, now we just need the industry around it. Sumitomo Metal Mining — Japan's largest nickel smelter and a supplier for the Panasonic lithium-ion batteries used in Tesla EVs — said in March it expected global demand for nickel to increase by 20 per cent during 2022 alone. According to research firm Wood Mackenzie, nickel consumption for EV batteries is projected to increase 64 per cent between 2019 and 2025. Along with Australia, Indonesia has the world's largest nickel reserves, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), an American government body. USGS reports that mine production in Indonesia increased by 30 per cent during 2021, which it attributed to the ""ongoing commissioning"" of projects across the resource-rich archipelago. Mr Widodo's visit to Space X followed a recent meeting between Mr Musk and senior minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, and Indonesian officials told Reuters that working-level discussions on investment in the nickel industry had already taken place. Indonesia's Minister for Investment, Bahlil Lahadalia, said Mr Musk would ""lose out"" if he did not invest in the country. ""I think it's great that Indonesia has a big population and the population is growing,"" Mr Musk said during his meeting with Mr Widodo in Texas. ""This is very good. Because, like, we need a lot of people for the future — and also Mars. Mars does not have any people, so we need people for Mars,"" he joked. ""Indonesia seems very optimistic and positive about the future, which is awesome,"" Mr Musk added. ""I'm really fired up by how fired up you all are."" But not everyone is so excited by the prospect of further investment in nickel mining in Indonesia, which is associated with coal-fired power plants. When this diver saw more rubbish than fish in the ocean, she took action. A group of Indonesian environmental activists have written to Mr Musk, pointing to previous statements the billionaire has made around environmental sustainability. ""If Tesla wants to invest in Indonesia, they should make it free from coal-fired power plants,"" said Pius Ginting, coordinator of the Action for Ecology and People's Emancipation Association (known by its Indonesian acronym AEER), in the letter. ""Because doing so conflicts with the aim of electric transportation: reducing total gas emission,"" he added. In mid-2020, Mr Musk called upon mining firms to boost their production of nickel to meet Tesla's needs. ""Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way,"" Mr Musk said at the time. Indonesia has long sought to boost domestic processing of nickel ore and other minerals — not just exporting the raw product — partly as a way to create local jobs. But smelting nickel in Indonesia often relies on energy from coal, and environmentalists say the country's nickel industry does not meet ""environmentally sensitive"" standards. While Indonesia has committed to ending the construction of new coal-fired power plants after 2023, coal power generation remains a key source of energy and accounts for more than a third of the country's total carbon emissions. Moh Taufik hopes Tesla will consider environmental harm caused by mining companies on the island of Sulawesi — the source of much of Indonesia's nickel. ""Nickel mining activity has violated residents' rights to breathe in clean air,"" Mr Taufik, coordinator of Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM) in the province of Central Sulawesi, told the ABC. A 2019 study by AEER found that coal plants used for the production of nickel in the Central Sulawesi town of Morowali had caused respiratory infections among local residents. AEER reports that disposal methods by nickel plants in Sulawesi pose ""a grave threat to the rich marine life in Indonesia's seas"" and affect the livelihoods of fishermen. ""If the company wants to invest in the area, hopefully it's not planning to throw hazardous waste used as raw materials for electric vehicles [into] the sea in Morowali and other regions,"" Mr Taufik said. AEER argues that when small-scale nickel mining operations began in Morowali in the late 2000s, traditional farmers in the area were affected by floods exacerbated by the extractive industry. Environmentalists in Indonesia claim that among the thousands of tonnes of paper bales sent to East Java are household waste items including faeces-contaminated nappies. Morowali is now the site of the largest nickel-based industrial area in Indonesia, funded by domestic and Chinese investors. And in 2020, flash floods hit Morowali, swamping two villages and forcing 175 residents to evacuate. Mr Taufik said the Indonesian government must also weigh the consequences for residents if Tesla ever builds a facility in Sulawesi. ""The government have to determine whether this decision will benefit local residents or will just trigger land conflicts between company and residents,"" he said. ""Tesla's decision to come and build a power plant might remove residents from their living or working areas, like farms."" ""This very likely to happen and local residents will definitely lose."" The Indonesian Environment Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Tesla was also approached for comment.

55,The barbaric 'creativity' of Putin's troops in Ukraine: Turning household items into deadly traps ,world,"  In the hills outside the village of Vilkhivka, east of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the remnants of the Russian occupation are strewn across the landscape. Warning: This article contains details readers might find distressing. Empty ammunition boxes are left discarded on a hillside. Crates for transporting rockets sit among the weeds. Russian tank tracks remain seared into the ground. And then there's what you can't see. Beneath these fields lie anti-personnel mines designed to maim and terrorise the civilian population. They are a departing gift from Russian forces, left before they were overrun by Ukrainian fighters. A unit of brave de-miners is working its way through the field, clearing a safe path for the local electricity company workers who are trying to repair the damage done to the power supply. Artur Silchenko is leading the team of de-miners. Built like a nightclub bouncer, with a no-nonsense persona to match, the 25-year-old has the unenviable role of neutralising the unexploded devices that are now scattered across this area. ""We check fields, forests, riversides, private households and commercial buildings. We work with all kinds of explosive devices,"" he tells the ABC. Included in their broad brief is defusing booby traps and mines that have been placed in the homes of families who fled the nearby villages when the Russians invaded. ""Most of the time they're near the fence or the gates and the door thresholds,"" he says. ""It depends on the creativity of who is mining. They put them in chargers, light bulbs, in lamps. ""Near Kyiv, there was a case where they put a mine under a child's pillow."" There have been reports of a grenade placed inside a 10-year-old's piano in Bucha and claims made by one surgeon of teddy bears being booby trapped. Artur says his team has seen firsthand evidence of children being targeted. ""We found two booby traps near a child's cot and, in a few other cases, inside a child's room,"" he says. When asked how he feels about children's rooms being mined, he looks at the ground in despair and shakes his head. ""I don't know what to say. It's terrible,"" he says. ""I don't understand. Why you would do that? These are children."" This is extraordinarily dangerous work. Three of the unit's men were killed near Kharkiv on April 17, while de-mining cluster munitions. Another four were badly injured in the same incident. Two weeks ago, another two members of a mine-clearing team were admitted to hospital after a mine was detonated. Ihor Ovcharuk — the acting chief of humanitarian de-mining for the Kharkiv region — was one of those injured in the most recent incident, which occurred on May 9. The ABC spoke to him just days after he checked himself out of hospital and returned to work. ""We had been working at the checkpoint near Ruska Lozova when an anti-personnel mine detonated,"" he says. ""I injured my face, hands, leg and knee. I am OK. I have minor injuries, but my colleague is more seriously injured and he is still in the hospital. ""Unfortunately, he lost a part of his leg. He had injuries to the lungs, and they are trying to [save] his left eye and his left ear."" Under Ihor's  supervision, more than 3,500 de-mining trips have been conducted, and more than 2,200 explosive devices have been cleared. This week, he was awarded the prestigious Ukrainian Order of Courage. Despite this award for valour, he does not consider himself any kind of hero. ""I am just doing regular work,"" he insists. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned over a month ago there was evidence that Russian soldiers were booby trapping people's homes as they withdrew from the northern areas of his country. ""They are mining all this territory,"" he said in one of his late-night addresses to the nation. ""Mining houses, equipment, even the bodies of killed people. Too many trip-wire mines. Too many other dangers."" These warnings soon proved prescient for those who have homes in the villages north of Kharkiv. After Tsyrkuny was liberated from the Russians on May 7, the local Governor, Oleh Synyehubov, announced that two women in the village had been killed by booby traps. Vasyl Bilous is one of the people who helps warn communities about the dangers of mines. An academic with a PhD in criminology, in wartime he found himself volunteering with the Joint Forces of Kharkiv. They are helping residents integrate back into the villages. ""I am outraged that the Russian occupiers have polluted the Ukrainian land, not only with their own bodies but with all these mines and booby traps too,"" he says. ""There are many cases of booby traps being placed in electronic devices. ""This is one of the crimes of the Russian Federation towards humanity when they are using such objects to make children and other people suffer."" He says that his counterparts from other units have discovered evidence of Russia mining the bodies of their own fallen soldiers. The ABC has not been able to independently verify these reports, but they back up allegations made by Ukraine's President. ""They even put traps on their own soldiers' bodies,"" Vasyl says. ""Now our sappers have to de-mine the body, then take it and bring it to identification, and later send it to Russia."" Artur Silchenko says he has never seen evidence of this, but he has heard about it and his workers now take appropriate precautions. ""We take special equipment with us, so you can fix a hook to the body to make sure it's not trapped,"" he says. ""We then pull and turn the body around to make sure there is nothing under it."" In the months since the Russian invasion, surgeon Sergiy Belashov has had to deal with a range of traumatic injuries from artillery, missile strikes and now landmines. ""Usually [landmine victims] have injuries of the limbs, chest, abdomen as well as the head,"" Dr Belashov says. ""Fragmentations can hit various parts of the body. ""We provide first aid here to these patients as well as redistributing them to other medical institutions or hospitals if needed."" Asked how he feels about seeing wounds from mines and booby traps left in homes in villages surrounding the city, he says he has to try to control his emotions. ""Of course I feel anger,"" he says. ""I have to hold myself in order to keep working when I come across such cases. ""These are very terrible injuries, the destiny of these people will be different after such injuries as many will be disabled for the rest of their lives."" In the field outside of Vilkhivka, Artur takes a call. He's been summoned to the nearby village of Stepanky to help de-mine a house. Despite the risks to him and his colleagues, his crew never turns down a request for help. ""We find the strength,"" he says. ""We know who we are working for: our families, for children, for the common good."" ""We and the armed forces of Ukraine are doing the work that needs to be done together.""

56,Chinese military exercises in South China Sea coincide with Biden's East Asia visit ,world,"  Chinese military exercises in South China Sea coincide with Joe Biden's first East Asia visit China is holding military exercises in the disputed South China Sea coinciding with US President Joe Biden's visits to South Korea and Japan that are largely focused on countering the perceived threat from Beijing. The Maritime Safety Administration office in the southern island province of Hainan said the drills began Thursday and would continue through until Monday. It said other aircraft and vessels will be prohibited from entering the area but gave no further details. Mr Biden arrived in South Korea on Friday, the first stop on his first trip to Asia as President. He was due to meet new President Yoon Suk-yeol, a relative newcomer to politics, for the first time in person. The two were to tour a Samsung Electronics plant together ahead of a full day of events on Saturday. China claims the South China Sea virtually in its entirety and the crucial waterway has become a potential flashpoint for conflict in Asia. The US does not take a foreign position on the sovereignty issue but insists on the right to operate freely in the sea and frequently sails warships close to militarised Chinese-held islands in the area in what are termed ""freedom of navigation operations"". China routinely protests such missions, labelling them deliberate provocations that endanger peace and stability. It is the first time China has argued for ""indivisible security"" — a concept that means no state should strengthen its security at the expense of another nation — outside the context of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. To assert its claim, it has built airstrips and other military infrastructure atop human-made islands built on coral reefs and atolls. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan also exercise overlapping claims in the South China Sea. The Philippine coast guard said on Friday it had established outposts on three islands in the contested waters, a move that will likely be frowned upon by Beijing. Since the beginning of the month China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, has been conducting a mission in the Sea of Japan, described by the Defence Ministry as ""routine training"" aimed at boosting performance that is ""in-line with relevant international law and international practice, and not targeting any party"". China also flew a pair of long-range nuclear-capable H-6 bombers through the area on Wednesday, Chinese media reports said. While in Japan, Mr Biden will meet on Tuesday with fellow leaders of the Indo-Pacific strategic alliance known as the Quad, a group that includes Australia, India and Japan. The four nations share concerns over China's growing regional assertiveness and increasingly capable armed forces. China views the grouping as a part of a US-led push to impede its economic and political rise and frustrate its attempts to intimidate self-governing Taiwan into accepting its demand to accept Beijing rule. On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised what he called negative moves by Washington and Tokyo against Beijing during a video call with Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi. ""What arouses attention and vigilance is the fact that, even before the American leader has set out for the meeting, the so-called joint Japan-US anti-China rhetoric is already kicking up dust,"" Mr Wang said, according to China's Foreign Ministry. Philippines officials in a statement on Friday said the three new coast guard outposts on three islands in the hotly contested Spratly archipelago would monitor ship movements and promote safety, amid increasing maritime tensions with China. The statement came only days after Philippines president-elect Ferdinand Marcos Jr said his country's ties with China would expand and ""shift to a higher gear"" when he took power. China has protested any new constructions in the region although it has transformed seven disputed reefs into military-guarded island bases in past years. Coast guard Admiral Artemio Abu said the outposts on the islands, which were established this week, would be staffed by coast guard personnel and equipped with radio communications to report any incidents. The fall of Kabul and the damage wrought by Delta have been occupying the world's focus, but in the waters to Australia's north, foreign navies have been gathering. Admiral Abu did not specify how many personnel would be stationed at the new outposts but said it was the largest deployment in the disputed region so far. ""Through these command observation posts, we improve our capabilities in promoting maritime safety, maritime search and rescue, and marine environmental protection,"" he said in a statement. The three islands have been occupied by Filipino troops for years and are internationally known as West York and Nanshan islands and Northeast Cay. Last week, the coast guard installed five navigational buoys carrying Philippine flags just off the three islands and near Thitu island, the largest of nine islands and islets Filipino forces have occupied in the Spratlys. The Philippines considers much of the Spratlys as part of its western Palawan province. The ""sovereign markers"" flash lights at night to guide fishermen and ships and ""communicate that the said vicinity waters are considered special protected zones"" where mining and oil exploration are prohibited to preserve their rich natural resources, Admiral Abu said without elaborating. China and the Association of South-East Asian Nations, which includes four member states involved in the territorial disputes, have resumed talks this year on a proposed ""Code of Conduct,"" or a non-aggression pact aimed at preventing armed confrontations in the region. But the negotiations have faced years of delay, partly due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.

57,Eight towns gain city status in celebration of Queen's Platinum Jubilee,world,"  Eight towns gain city status in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee Towns from across the United Kingdom and its overseas territories have been named cities as part of Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Eight towns were granted city status as winners of the Civic Honours competition, held to honour the British monarch's 70th year on the throne. The towns were: Bangor in Northern Ireland, Colchester, Milton Keynes and Doncaster in England, as well as Douglas in the Isle of Man, Dunfermline in Scotland, Stanley in the Falkland Islands and Wrexham in Wales. The UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that winning city status can open up opportunities for people living in the cities, citing research that says the local economy of Perth expanded by 12 per cent after winning city status in 2012. ""What was clear to me during the process of assessing each application was the pride that people felt for their communities, local cultural heritage and the Royal Family,"" Steve Barclay, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said in a statement. ""As we celebrate Her Majesty The Queen's colossal contribution to society, I am thrilled that we are able to recognise some of the many places that make Britain great."" Applications for the competition closed in December last year, with local authorities required to make a case for why their area deserved to be granted the honour of city status. Applications were then assessed by a panel of experts and Cabinet Office Ministers before recommendations were put to the Queen. Queen Elizabeth II makes a surprise appearance at a ceremony to mark the completion of a long-awaited London Tube line named in her honour. They were required to highlight royal associations as well as cultural heritage. Southampton was also awarded Lord Mayoralty status as a part of City Honours competition. The status entitles the Southampton Mayor to be known as Lord Mayor. The competition has taken place in each of the last three jubilee years, with Chelmsford, Lisburn and Newport among previous winners. It was last run a decade ago, to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. This was the first time Crown dependencies and overseas territories were open to apply for city status. The awards will be formally presented to the winners later this year.

58,Canada bans China's Huawei Technologies from 5G networks,world,"  Canada bans China's Huawei Technologies from 5G networks Wireless carriers in Canada won't be allowed to install Huawei equipment in their high-speed 5G networks, the Canadian government said on Thursday, joining allies in banning the giant Chinese technology company. Canada had been the only member of the Five Eyes intelligence-pooling alliance not to bar or restrict use of equipment from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in its 5G networks. The US and the other members — the UK, Australia and New Zealand — previously banned Huawei. ""We are announcing our intention to prohibit the inclusion of Huawei and ZTE products and services in Canada's telecommunications systems,"" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said. Canada's ban also includes ZTE Corp, one of China's biggest tech companies and one that is state-owned. Mr Champagne added that ""providers who already have this equipment installed will be required to cease its use and remove it."" He said Canada's wireless companies won't be offered compensation. Chinese state media is awash with the news of the return of ""Huawei princess"" Meng Wanzhou. But for more than a day, it remained silent on a key detail of the story — the release of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Canada's major wireless companies already had started working with other providers. ""There are many hostile actors who are ready to exploit vulnerabilities in our defences,"" Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said. Mr Mendicino said the government did an extensive review and is redoubling efforts to protect Canadians. China condemned the move against one of its national champions as a form of ""political manipulation"" carried out in coordination with the US, which was aimed at ""suppressing"" Chinese companies in violation of free-market principles. ""China will comprehensively and seriously evaluate this incident and take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" the Chinese Embassy in Canada said in a statement posted on its website. China commonly employs such language in commercial disputes, which often does not lead to a firm response from Beijing. The US government has been lobbying allies like Canada for years to exclude Huawei from new ultra-fast 5G mobile networks over worries that China's communist rulers could compel the company to help with cyber espionage. The US has warned it would reconsider intelligence sharing with any countries that use Huawei gear. Political editor Andrew Probyn takes a deep dive into Huawei's history to unpick the anxiety within the Australian intelligence community. The company has repeatedly denied the allegations. ""We're disappointed but not surprised. We're surprised it took the government so long to make a decision,"" Huawei spokesman Alykhan Velshi said. ""We see this as a political decision, one born of political pressure primarily from the United States."" Mr Velshi said there will be Huawei equipment in Canada for years to come. He said the company has more than 1,500 employees in Canada and two-thirds of them work in research and development. The development of 5G, or fifth-generation, networks will give people speedier online connections and provide vast data capacity to meet ravenous demand as more and more things link to the internet and innovations such as virtual reality, immersive gaming and autonomous vehicles emerge. Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies. It has been a symbol of China's progress in becoming a technological world power — and a subject of US security and law enforcement concerns. Some analysts say Chinese companies have flouted international rules and norms and stolen technology. China, the US and Canada completed what was effectively a high-stakes prisoner swap last year involving a top executive from Huawei who had been charged with fraud by the US. What exactly is Huawei and why does it seem like it's continually being targeted by foreign governments? China jailed two Canadians shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei Technologies' chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder, on a US extradition request. They were sent back to Canada in September, the same day Ms Meng returned to China after reaching a deal with US authorities in her case. Many countries labelled China's action ""hostage politics,"" while China has described the charges against Huawei and Ms Meng as a politically motivated attempt to hold back China's economic and technological development. ""The decision should have been taken two or three years ago, but it's a case of better late than never,"" Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said of the move to ban Huawei. ""We are faced with a China that is a lot more aggressive in the conduct of its foreign policy but also in the way it obtains information to achieve its goals."" Mr Saint-Jacques said that under Chinese law no company can refuse a request from the Chinese government to share information, so it would have been impossible to allow Huawei's participation. He expects China to retaliate. ""I expect we will hear from them pretty rapidly,"" he said. ""They use trade as a weapon and I suspect that's what we'll see in this case.""

59,Sri Lanka Prime Minister warns of food shortages amid economic crisis and lack of fertiliser,world,"  Sri Lanka Prime Minister warns of food shortages amid economic crisis and lack of fertiliser Sri Lanka's Prime Minister has warned of a food shortage and vowed the government would buy enough fertiliser for the next planting season as the island nation battles a devastating economic crisis. A decision in April last year by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to ban all chemical fertilisers drastically cut yields and although the government has reversed the ban, no substantial imports have yet taken place. In a series of tweets late on Thursday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that the US had forecast a ""world food shortage"" and identified Sri Lanka and Afghanistan as countries ""to be badly affected"". ""While there may not be time to obtain fertiliser for this Yala [May-August] season, steps are being taken to ensure adequate stocks for the Maha [September-March] season,"" Mr Wickremesinghe said. ""I sincerely urge everyone to accept the gravity of the… situation."" Sri Lanka is facing a dire shortage of foreign exchange, fuel and medicines, and economic activity has slowed to a crawl. The Public Administration Ministry asked public officials — except for those who maintain essential services — to stay home from work on Friday in ""view of current fuel shortage and issues in transport facilities"" across the country. State- and government-approved private schools also closed on Friday amid the worsening fuel shortage, with thousands of people waiting in queues at fuel stations across the country for days at a time. Sri Lanka is now almost without petrol and faces an acute shortage of other fuels as well. ""There is no point in talking about how hard life is,"" said APD Sumanavathi, a 60-year-old woman selling fruit and vegetables in the Pettah market in Colombo, the commercial capital, on Friday. ""I can't predict how things will be in two months, at this rate we might not even be here."" Nearby, a long queue had formed in front of a shop selling cooking gas cylinders, the prices of which have soared. ""Only about 200 cylinders were delivered, even though there were about 500 people,"" said Mohammad Shazly, a part-time chauffeur who said he was standing in the line for the third day to be able to cook food for his family of five. ""Without gas, without kerosene oil, we can't do anything. ""Last option what? Without food we are going to die. That will happen, hundred per cent."" Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigns after weeks of major protests over an economic crisis that has cut off basic services. The central bank governor said on Thursday that foreign exchange had been secured from a World Bank loan and remittances to pay for fuel and cooking gas shipments, but supplies are still to flow through. Inflation could rise further to a staggering 40 per cent in the next couple of months but it was being driven largely by supply-side pressures, and measures by the bank and government were already reining in demand-side inflation, the governor added. Inflation hit 29.8 per cent in April with food prices up 46.6 per cent year-on-year. As anger against the government spread, police fired tear gas and water canon to push back hundreds of student protesters in Colombo on Thursday. The protesters are demanding the ouster of the president as well as the prime minister. Sri Lanka's economic crisis has come from the confluence of the COVID-19 pandemic battering the tourism-reliant economy, rising oil prices and populist tax cuts by the government of President Rajapaksa and his brother, Mahinda, who resigned as prime minister last week. Dying in line for fuel, no paper for exams and hours without power: this is what a day looks like in the tropical nation as Sri Lanka faces its worst economic crisis. Mr Wickremesinghe, appointed prime minister in his place, is accused of a being a stooge of the brothers. Other factors have included heavily subsidised domestic prices of fuel and a decision to ban the import of chemical fertilisers, which devastated the agriculture sector. The Group of Seven economic powers supports efforts to provide debt relief for Sri Lanka, G7 finance chiefs said on Thursday in a draft communique from a meeting in Germany after the country defaulted on its sovereign debt. P Nandalal Weerasinghe, the central bank chief, has said plans for a debt restructuring were almost finalised and he would be submitting a proposal to the cabinet soon. ""We are in pre-emptive default,"" he said. ""Our position is very clear, until there is a debt restructure, we cannot repay."" A spokesperson for the International Monetary Fund said the fund was monitoring developments very closely and that a virtual mission to Sri Lanka was expected to conclude technical talks on a potential loan program to country on May 24.

60,Captive medic’s bodycam shows firsthand horror of Mariupol,world,"  A celebrated Ukrainian medic recorded her time in Mariupol on a data card no bigger than a thumbnail and smuggled it out to the world in a tampon. Now she is in Russian hands, at a time when Mariupol itself is on the verge of falling. Yuliia Paievska is known in Ukraine as Taira, a moniker from the nickname she chose in the World of Warcraft video game. Using a body camera, she recorded 256 gigabytes of her team's frantic efforts over two weeks to bring people back from the brink of death. She got the harrowing clips to an Associated Press team, the last international journalists in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, one of whom fled with it in a tampon. Russian soldiers captured Taira and her driver the next day, March 16, one of many forced disappearances in areas of Ukraine now held by Russia. Russia has portrayed Taira as working for the nationalist Azov battalion, in line with Moscow's narrative that it is attempting to ""de-nazify"" Ukraine. However, the AP found no such evidence, and friends and colleagues said she had no links to Azov. The military hospital where she led evacuations of the wounded is not affiliated with the battalion, whose members have spent weeks defending a sprawling steel plant in Mariupol. The footage Taira recorded itself testifies to the fact that she tried to save wounded Russian soldiers as well as Ukrainian civilians. A clip recorded on March 10 shows two Russian soldiers taken roughly out of an ambulance by a Ukrainian soldier. One is in a wheelchair. The other is on his knees, hands bound behind his back, with an obvious leg injury. Their eyes are covered by winter hats, and they wear white armbands. A Ukrainian soldier curses at one of them. ""Calm down, calm down,"" Taira tells him. A woman asks her: ""Are you going to treat the Russians?"" ""They will not be as kind to us,"" she replies. ""But I couldn't do otherwise. They are prisoners of war."" Taira is now a prisoner of the Russians, one of hundreds of prominent Ukrainians who have been kidnapped or captured, including local officials, journalists, activists and human rights defenders. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has so far recorded 204 cases of enforced disappearances. It said some victims may have been tortured, and five were later found dead. The office of Lyudmila Denisova — Ukraine's Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights (or ombudsman) — said it had received reports of thousands of missing people by late April, 528 of whom have probably been captured. Her office also said Russian troops were also are targeting medics and hospitals, even though the Geneva Convention singles out both military and civilian medics for protection ""in all circumstances"". The World Health Organization has verified more than 100 attacks on health care facilities since the war began, a number likely to rise. More recently, Russian soldiers pulled a woman off a convoy from Mariupol on May 8, accused her of being a military medic and forced her to choose between letting her 4-year-old daughter accompany her to an unknown fate or continuing on to Ukrainian-controlled territory. The mother and child ended up separated, and the little girl made it to the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, UN officials said. ""This is not about saving one particular woman,"" said Oleksandra Chudna, who volunteered as a medic with Taira in 2014. ""Taira will represent those medics and women who went to the front."" Taira's situation takes on a new significance as the last defenders in Mariupol are evacuated into Russian territories, in what Russia calls a mass surrender and Ukraine calls a mission accomplished. Russia says more than 1,700 Ukrainian fighters have surrendered this week in Mariupol, bringing new attention to the treatment of prisoners. Ukraine has expressed hope that the fighters can be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war, but a Russian official has said, without evidence, that they should be not exchanged but put on trial. Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government has said it tried to add Taira's name to a prisoner exchange weeks ago. However, Russia denies holding her, despite her appearance on television networks in the separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine and on the Russian NTV network, handcuffed and with her face bruised. The Ukrainian government declined to speak about the case when asked by the AP.

61,Fighters who defended Mariupol steel mill registered as POWs,world,"  Amid fear of Russian reprisals, hundreds of Ukrainian fighters — who surrendered after enduring the merciless assault on Mariupol's steel factory — have been registered as prisoners of war (POWs). Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed to seek international help to save them. The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Thursday that it had gathered personal information from hundreds of the soldiers — name, date of birth, closest relative — and registered them as prisoners as part of its role in ensuring the humane treatment of POWs under the Geneva Convention. Amnesty International said in a tweet that the POW status meant that the soldiers ""must not be subjected to any form of torture or ill-treatment"". More than 1,700 defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have surrendered since Monday, Russian authorities said, in what appeared to be the final stage in the nearly three-month siege of the now-pulverised port city. Nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fighters who had held out inside Mariupol's pulverised steel plant have surrendered after a battle that turned the city into a worldwide symbol of defiance and suffering. At least some of the fighters were taken by the Russians to a former penal colony in a territory controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. Others were admitted to hospital, according to a separatist official. However, an undisclosed number of fighters remained in the warren of bunkers and tunnels in the sprawling plant. In a brief video message, the deputy commander of the Azov Regiment — which led the defence of the steel mill — said he and other fighters were still inside. ""An operation is underway, the details of which I will not announce,"" Svyatoslav Palamar said. Mr Zelenskyy pledged to seek the world's help. ""I am doing everything I can so that the most-influential international forces are informed and, as much as possible, involved in saving our troops,"" he said. While Ukraine expressed hope for a prisoner exchange, Russian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the Azovstal fighters for war crimes and put them on trial, branding them ""Nazis"" and criminals. The Azov Regiment's far-right origins have been seized on by the Kremlin as part of an effort to cast Russia's invasion as a battle against Nazi influence in Ukraine. Taking the Azovstal steel plant would allow Russia to claim complete control of Mariupol and secure a long-sought victory. However, it would be a mostly symbolic victory at this point, since the city is already effectively in Moscow's hands, and analysts say that most of the Russian forces who were tied down by the battle there have already left. Kyiv's troops, bolstered by Western weapons, thwarted Russia's initial goal of storming the capital and have put up stiff resistance against Moscow's forces in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that President Vladimir Putin has set his sights on capturing. The surprising success of Ukraine's troops has buoyed Kyiv's confidence. Meanwhile, with the number of defenders left holed up in the steel factory dwindling, Russian commanders will be coming under increasing pressure to reallocate soldiers from the strategic southern port city to bolster their offensive in eastern Ukraine, Britain's Defence Ministry said on Friday, local time. Hundreds of Ukrainian fighters have surrendered at Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks, bringing an end to the most devastating siege of Russia's war in Ukraine. Here's how the fight for Mariupol played out from the beginning. If the factory falls, Russia will likely use soldiers from the city to reinforce operations elsewhere in the eastern industrial Donbas region, but the duration of the stiff resistance will complicate or prolong that manoeuvre, Britain's Ministry of Defence said in a daily intelligence report. ""Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively,"" the ministry wrote on Twitter. ""Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives. ""That means that Russia will probably redistribute [its] forces swiftly, without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition."" Analysts have said it is likely that most of the Russian forces who were tied down by the battle in Mariupol have already left. However, it is not clear how long the remaining fighters in the Azovstal factory can still hold out.

62,"Actress Marnie Schulenburg dies, aged 37, two years after cancer diagnosis",world,"  As the World Turns star Marnie Schulenburg dies, aged 37, two years after breast cancer diagnosis Actress Marnie Schulenburg has died of cancer at the age of 37, two years after she was diagnosed with stage-four metastatic breast cancer. Representatives for Schulenburg, best known for her roles on As the World Turns and One Life To Live, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that the soap star died on Tuesday at a hospital in the US state of New Jersey. She is survived by her husband Zack Robidas, who had roles on Succession and Sorry for Your Loss, and their two-year-old daughter Coda. ""Please don't say Marnie lost her battle to cancer. It's simply not true. I watched her kick cancer's ass every day since diagnosis,"" Robidas said, according to Variety. ""She is incredible. We chose to attack her diagnosis with blind optimism. We only talked about the future and continued moving forward. I don’t know if this was right but it's all we knew how to do."" On social media, fans have paid tribute to the actress, who had documented her battle with cancer after initially being misdiagnosed with mastitis. She had described it as an ""insidious"" and ""aggressive"" disease that affects ""younger women, and disguises itself as a breastfeeding infection"". In her final Instagram post on Mother's Day, Schulenburg reflected her diagnosis two years earlier, saying she ""truly thought my life was over"". ""So here’s to remembering that nothing is permanent,"" she wrote. ""To soaking up the imperfections and that the best thing you can do for your child is make them feel loved, safe and supported just like my mother did for me.

63,'Women being erased': Taliban orders female TV presenters to cover their face,world,"  Female Afghan TV presenters ordered to cover face on air, as women's rights further diminish under Taliban rule Taliban authorities in Afghanistan have asked television broadcasters to ensure that female presenters on local stations cover their faces when on air, officials say. They did not say what the consequences would be for not following the advice The move comes days after authorities ordered women to cover their faces in public, a return to a policy of the Taliban's past hardline rule and an escalation of restrictions that are causing anger at home and abroad. ""Yesterday we met with media officials … they accepted our advice very happily,"" Akif Mahajar, spokesman for the Taliban's Ministry of Vice and Virtue said, adding this move would be received well by Afghans. While he framed the move as ""advice"", Mr Mahajar added: ""The last date for face covering for TV presenters is May 21,"" referring to when compliance with the new requirement should begin. He did not respond to a query on what the consequences would be for not following the advice, but said female presenters could wear a medical face mask, as has been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several female anchors and presenters posted their photos on social media showing them with their faces covered with face masks during presenting programs. One prominent TOLO presenter, Yalda Ali, posted a video of herself putting on a face mask. ""A woman being erased, on orders from the Virtue and Vice Ministry,"" she wrote. Most Afghan women wear a headscarf for religious reasons, but many in urban areas such as Kabul do not cover their faces. During the Taliban's last rule from 1996 to 2001, it was mandatory for women to wear the all-encompassing burqa, which covers the face and allows sight through a mesh window. Not all Afghan women are willing to obey the latest order from the Taliban to wear the full-length burka and veil. Women in Afghanistan had pursued work and education after the Taliban government was toppled in 2001, endeavours that were forbidden to them under Taliban rule at the time. The Taliban says it has changed since its last rule, but recently added regulations such as limiting women's movement without a male chaperone. Older girls above 13 years old are also yet to be allowed back to schools and colleges. A local television channel's female employee, who wished to remain anonymous, told Reuters Taliban officials had visited their office on Wednesday. ""Today [Thursday] the production department wore masks but the news office continued as usual,"" the employee said. Some channels have already begun implementing the new rule.

64,Third time lucky for Starliner capsule trying to take mannequin to space station,world,"  Boeing's Starliner crew capsule set to dock with space station after successful launch Boeing's new Starliner crew capsule has rocketed into orbit on a test flight bound for the International Space Station. This latest mission comes after years of being grounded by flaws that could have doomed the spacecraft. Only a test dummy was aboard as the rocket launched. If the capsule reaches the International Space Station on Friday and everything else goes well, two or three NASA test pilots could strap in by the end of this year or early next for the company's first crewed flight. It is Boeing's third shot at the high-stakes flight. Starliner's first test flight in 2019 was stricken by software errors so severe that the capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and had to skip the space station. The spacecraft came close to being destroyed as ground controllers hastily cut short the mission. After dozens of safety fixes, Boeing returned a different capsule to the launch pad last summer. Corroded valves halted the countdown, resulting in another round of repairs. The drawn-out test flight program has cost Boeing approximately US$600 million (more than $851 million). ""We're not going to fly [crews] unless we feel like we've bought down the risk,"" NASA space operations chief Kathy Lueders stressed on the eve of lift-off. Boeing is seeking redemption as it attempts to catch up with SpaceX, NASA's other contracted taxi service. Elon Musk's company has been flying astronauts to and from the space station for two years and delivering cargo for a full decade. Eager to reduce its high-priced dependency on Russia for crew transport, NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to launch astronauts to the space station after the shuttle program ended in 2011. NASA administrator Bill Nelson said that was why it was so important for Boeing's Starliner to succeed. ""We always, in this case, want to have a backup,"" Mr Nelson said hours before lift-off. Starliner will spend close to a week at the space station before aiming for a touchdown in the New Mexico desert. US aerospace giant Boeing continues to face setbacks in its effort to launch that Starliner capsule, with the latest system glitch coming a week after an incident in which the International Space Station was briefly thrust out of control. Different in looks but similar in function to SpaceX's Dragon capsule, Boeing's fully automated capsule will attempt to dock at the space station on its own. However, station astronauts will be ready to steer the capsule by remote control if necessary. NASA has yet to finalise which astronauts will be in the first Starliner crew. The program is so far behind that the original three have stepped aside. The leading candidates gathered at Cape Canaveral for the evening launch of Starliner atop United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket. ""We're thrilled for this because the next one is us,"" astronaut Butch Wilmore said. Besides Rosie the Rocketeer — a space-age version of World War II's Rosie the Riveter — the capsule is carrying groceries and spacewalking gear for the seven station residents. US spacewalks have been on hold since an astronaut's helmet took on water in March. NASA is sending up extra absorbent pads for use in helmets, in case an emergency spacewalk is required as the investigation continues. Boeing also is flying mementos from historically black colleges and universities and tree seeds similar to those Apollo astronauts took to the Moon that became so-called Moon trees here on Earth.

65,Amber Heard testified against Johnny Depp this week. Here's what we learned,world,"  Amber Heard testified against Johnny Depp this week. Here's what we learned When actor Amber Heard wrapped up her time on the witness stand this week, it was after two gruelling days of cross-examination in which she was questioned about the truthfulness of her allegations of physical and sexual abuse against actor Johnny Depp. WARNING: This article contains disturbing content. Depp is suing Heard over a 2018 opinion piece published in the Washington Post in which she does not mention him but refers to herself as ""a public figure representing domestic abuse"". Heard is countersuing Depp, saying he smeared her by calling her a liar. The Hollywood actors were married in February 2015 and finalised their divorce about two years later. Heard told the court she loved Depp but knew she would not survive if she did not leave him. The questioning was particularly intense when Depp's lawyer, Camille Vasquez, quizzed Heard about a March 2015 fight the couple had on a trip to Australia, when Depp was shooting the fifth film in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Heard says she was sexually assaulted with a liquor bottle during that fight, but Depp says he was the victim, having lost the tip of his middle finger when Heard threw a vodka bottle at him. ""You're the one who assaulted someone with a bottle in Australia, isn't that right, Ms Heard?"" Ms Vasquez asked. ""I didn't assault Johnny in Australia,"" Heard said. ""I didn't assault Johnny ever."" Ms Vasquez grilled her further. ""You weren't scared of him at all, were you?"" ""This is a man who tried to kill me,"" Heard said. ""Of course it's scary. He's also my husband."" Meanwhile, a key witness painted a picture of Depp as a violent man who was quite often under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Actor Ellen Barkin testified in a taped deposition. She said she met Depp in 1990 and they were friends for about 10 years. The two co-starred in the 1998 movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Barkin told the court she was in a sexual relationship with Depp for several months after she moved to Hollywood in 1994. She said Depp often drank to excess. ""He was drunk … a lot of the time,"" Barkin said. She also testified that he took drugs in her presence ""all the time"" and he threw a wine bottle in her direction on one occasion. She referred to him as angry and controlling. ""He's just a jealous man, controlling, 'Where are you going?' 'Who are you going with?' 'What did you do last night?'"" she recounted. ""I had a scratch on my back once that got him very, very angry because he insisted it came from me having sex with a person who wasn't him."" Others who had previously been close to Depp charted his rise and fall as a man who went from being ""the biggest movie star in the world"" to someone who often failed to show up to film sets on time and battled a drug addiction. Depp says Heard's article has cost him his lucrative career in Hollywood, but her lawyers argue his own bad behaviour has resulted in his professional undoing. His former business manager, Joel Mandel, told the court he was concerned about Depp's finances, but was met with anger when he approached the actor. Mr Mandel said each month Depp was spending more than $US400,000 ($568,000) on full-time staff, on a doctor to get him sober, and prescription drugs. ""The spending levels had grown very, very, very large and required that level of incredibly high income to be maintained,"" Mr Mandel said. ""And when it dropped off, the disconnect became untenable."" He said Depp fired him in 2016. Raquel Pennington, a one-time friend of Heard's, cried as she testified in a recorded deposition played to the jury. She said she saw bruises and cuts on Heard multiple times, but she never personally witnessed Depp strike her. Ms Pennington said she took photos of Heard's face in December 2015 after a fight with Depp. In the photo Heard has a swollen nose, cut lip and both eyes are blackened. She also took photos of strands of hair that she said were ripped from Heard's scalp. The December 2015 fight is one of several disputed incidents. Jurors have been shown a video of Heard's appearance on a late-night talk show the next day in which the injuries are not visible. Ms Pennington said Heard ""often had to cover bruises and injuries on her face"" with make-up. ""Was there a name for what you describe as Mr Depp's different self?"" Ms Pennington was asked by a lawyer. ""We called it The Monster,"" Ms Pennington said. Ms Pennington said she and Heard were no longer friends, having grown apart in the past year. Heard's sister, Whitney Heard Henriquez, was the first witness to say she personally witnessed Depp hitting the actress when she testified in the civil trial this week. Ms Henriquez said a month after their wedding in March 2015, the couple fought after Heard found evidence Depp had already had an extramarital affair. She said Depp blamed Heard for his actions, and at one point she became caught between the pair, and she too was struck, with one of Depp's bodyguards intervening and breaking up the fight. ""By that time, Johnny had already grabbed Amber by the hair with one hand and was whacking her repeatedly in the face with the other,"" she said. Depp has said he has never struck Heard or any other woman. Ms Henriquez said she had the nickname ""marriage counsellor"" because she frequently tried to mediate between the pair. She acknowledged under cross-examination that she sometimes sided with Depp in the disputes and had worked to keep the couple together, even after witnessing her sister being physically assaulted. Depp lost a libel case against British tabloid The Sun in 2020 after it labelled him a ""wife-beater"", with a London High court judge ruling he had repeatedly assaulted Heard. This current trial in the Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia is getting close to ending, with testimony expected to wrap up next week. The closing arguments are scheduled to take place next Friday, May 27.

66,Jordan Thompson to face clay king Rafael Nadal first as Aussies learn French Open fate,world,"  Jordan Thompson draws Rafael Nadal in French Open as Aussies learn their first-round fate at Roland Garros Australian Jordan Thompson has been handed one of sport's cruellest assignments: playing Rafael Nadal in his clay-court kingdom at Roland Garros. Nadal is seeking to regain the French Open title he has won 13 times, with Sydneysider Thompson being the first hurdle in the Spaniard's path at Roland Garros, doubtless on his ""home"" Court Philippe Chatrier. Thursday's draw has thrown up for Thompson what could be any player's dream — or nightmare — assignment, but the 28-year-old will surely savour the prospect of battle against the greatest clay-courter in history. They have met once before, also in Paris, on the indoor hard court at Bercy in the Masters, with Nadal coming out on top 6-1, 7-6 (7/3). But Nadal has suffered an untimely recurrence of his foot injury in the build-up to this year's Open, meaning this could be the best time for any contenders to catch the 35-year-old at a venue where he's lost just three times in 108 matches, most recently in last year's epic semi-final with champion Novak Djokovic. Indeed, Thompson can take some encouragement from having reached the third round at Roland Garros three years ago — the best performance by any Australian man in recent times. Countryman Alexei Popyrin knows what it is like to face Nadal in a Roland Garros opener, having lost to the Spaniard in straight sets last year. This time, Popyrin has got a less high-profile but still potentially volcanic affair waiting in the unpredictable shape of Italian Fabio Fognini. Meanwhile, Australian number one Alex de Minaur's preparation for Roland Garros continues apace, reaching the semi-final of the Lyon Open on Friday after his opponent retired injured. It is the Australia's second clay-court semi-final in the space of a month, following his brilliant last-four contest in Barcelona with eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz, where the Sydneysider was beaten after holding match point against the Spanish wunderkind. De Minaur has landed French opponent Hugo Gaston, the world number 68, in his first round. If he makes it past the dangerous left-hander, the number 19 seed will then take on a qualifier in the next round before a potential third-round clash, most likely with Canada's Denis Shapovalov, or the new Danish Rune Holger. Thanasi Kokkinakis could enjoy the dubious pleasure of a second-round meeting with Alcaraz if he can defeat Spanish grinder Albert Ramos-Vinolas first up. John Millman has been given a huge task to tame rising American 27th seed Sebastian Korda in his opener, while the ever-resilient James Duckworth, who is just embarking on yet another comeback after the ninth bout of surgery in his career, has a winnable tie against Swede Mikael Ymer. Jason Kubler meets a fellow qualifier. Top Australian women's hope Ajla Tomljanovic, who suffered a thigh injury at the Morocco Open on Thursday, would surely have preferred a much kinder start than having to face Estonian fifth seed Anett Kontaveit when the tournament kicks off on Sunday. Finally, wildcard Daria Saville has landed a qualifier, while Astra Sharma, who was also knocked out in Morocco on Thursday, faces Russian Varvara Gracheva.

67,"Ukraine latest: Ukraine says Donbas region completely destroyed, US supports Nordic push to join NATO",world,"  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russian forces have ""completely destroyed"" the industrial Donbas region, and accused Moscow of carrying out senseless bombardments as it intensified its offensive. The Kremlin says it will be up to residents of areas in Ukraine controlled by Russian troops to determine their future status The US has strongly supported Finland and Sweden's bid to join the NATO alliance Mr Zelenskyy also accused Russian forces of attempting to kill as many Ukrainians and do as much damage as possible, repeating his charge that Russia was carrying out a genocide. He said while Ukrainian forces were continuing to liberate the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Russia was trying to exert even more pressure in the Donbas, which lies in the south-eastern part of Ukraine. ""It is hell there — and that is not an exaggeration,"" he said in a late night video address, adding 12 people had been killed in the ""brutal and absolutely senseless bombardment"" of Severodonetsk on Thursday. ""[There are] constant strikes on the Odesa region, on the cities of central Ukraine. The Donbas is completely destroyed,"" he said. ""This is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible, to destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible."" More than 1,700 defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have surrendered since Monday, Russian authorities said, in what appeared to be the final stage in the nearly three-month siege of the pulverised port city. Nearly 1,000 Ukrainian fighters who had held out inside Mariupol's pulverised steel plant have surrendered after a battle that turned the city into a worldwide symbol of defiance and suffering. At least some of the fighters were taken by the Russians to a former penal colony in territory controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. Others were hospitalised, according to a separatist official. But an undisclosed number remained in the warren of bunkers and tunnels in the sprawling plant. In a brief video message, the deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, which led the defence of the steel mill, said he and other fighters were still inside. ""An operation is underway, the details of which I will not announce,"" Svyatoslav Palamar said. While Ukraine expressed hope for a prisoner exchange, Russian authorities have threatened to investigate some of the Azovstal fighters for war crimes and put them on trial. Kyiv's troops, bolstered by Western weapons, thwarted Russia's initial goal of storming the capital Kyiv and have put up stiff resistance against Moscow's forces in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that President Vladimir Putin has set his sights on capturing. The surprising success of Ukraine's troops has buoyed Kyiv's confidence. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Mr Zelenskyy who was involved in several rounds of talks with Russia, said in a tweet addressed to Moscow: ""Do not offer us a cease-fire — this is impossible without total Russian troops withdrawal. ""Until Russia is ready to fully liberate occupied territories, our negotiating team is weapons, sanctions and money,"" he wrote. Russia again signalled its intent to incorporate or at least maintain influence over areas its troops have seized. Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin this week visited the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, which have been under the control of Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began in February. From the battle for Snake Island to a spate of military general deaths and the devastating loss of a battalion crossing a river, Russia's mistakes on the battlefield have left Vladimir Putin in an embarrassing position. He was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying the regions could become part of ""our Russian family"". Volodymyr Saldo, the Kremlin-installed head of the Kherson region, also appeared in a video on Telegram saying Kherson ""will become a subject of the Russian Federation"". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said residents of areas in Ukraine controlled by Russian troops must ""determine how and with whom they want to live"". Mr Peskov made the statement during a conference call with reporters after being asked about some Russian officials saying Russia could move to incorporate the captured Kherson region of southern Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesman responded by saying that authorities need to focus on providing basic services to the residents of areas under Russian control. US President Joe Biden met with the leaders of Finland and Sweden at the White House on Thursday to offer robust support for their applications to join NATO, while Turkey threatened to block the Nordic nations from becoming members of the alliance. Joining Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinisto in the White House Rose Garden, Mr Biden said: ""Finland and Sweden make NATO stronger."" Mr Biden said his administration was submitting paperwork to the US Congress for speedy approval once NATO members gave the two countries a green light. ""They meet every NATO requirement and then some,"" he said. ""Having two new NATO members in the high north will enhance the security of our alliance and deepen our security cooperation across the board."" Meanwhile, the US Senate overwhelmingly approved nearly $US40 billion ($56.6 billion) in new aid for Ukraine on Thursday — by far the largest US aid package for Ukraine to date. Mr Biden said the bill's passage ensured there would be no lapse in US funding for Ukraine.

68,'Sad news for the world': Chariots of Fire and Oscar-winning composer Vangelis dies at 79,world,"  Chariots of Fire composer Vangelis dies at 79 Vangelis, the Greek electronic composer who wrote the unforgettable Academy Award-winning score for the film Chariots of Fire and music for dozens of other movies, documentaries and TV series, has died at 79. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and other government officials expressed their condolences on Thursday. Greek media reported that Vangelis — born Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou — died in a French hospital late on Tuesday. ""Vangelis Papathanassiou is no longer among us,"" Mitsotakis tweeted, calling him an ""electronic sound trailblazer"" whose death is ""sad news for the entire world"". The opening credits of Chariots of Fire roll as a bunch of young runners progress in slow motion across a glum beach in Scotland, as a lazy, beat-backed tune rises. It is one of the most instantly recognisable musical themes in cinema — and its standing in popular culture has only been confirmed by the host of spoofs it has sired. The 1981 British film, which told the true story of two British runners competing in the 1924 Paris Olympics, remains Vangelis's most famous work, but his initial encounter with success came with his first Greek pop band in the 1960s. At 20, Vangelis and three friends formed the Forminx band in Athens, which did very well in Greece. After it disbanded, he wrote scores for several Greek films and later became a founding member — together with another later-to-be internationally famous Greek musician, Demis Roussos — of Aphrodite's Child. Based in Paris, the progressive rock group produced several European hits, and their final record, 666, released in 1972, is still highly acclaimed. He evolved into a one-man quasi-classical orchestra, using a vast array of electronic equipment to conjure up his enormously popular undulating waves of sound. A private, humorous man — burly, with shoulder-length hair and a trim beard — he quoted ancient Greek philosophy and saw the artist as a conduit for a basic universal force. He was fascinated by space exploration and wrote music for celestial bodies, but said he never sought stardom himself. Still, a micro-planet spinning somewhere between Mars and Jupiter — 6354 Vangelis — will forever bear his name. Born on March 29, 1943 near the city of Volos in central Greece, Vangelis started playing the piano at age 4, although he got no formal training and claimed he never learned to read notes. ""Orchestration, composition — they teach these things in music schools, but there are some things you can never teach,"" he said in a 1982 interview. ""You can't teach creation."" Vangelis's Chariots score won one of the four Academy Awards the film captured, including best picture. Vangelis later wrote music scores for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), as well as for Missing (1982) and Antarctica (1983), among others. His interest in science — including the physics of music and sound — and space exploration led to compositions linked with major NASA and European Space Agency projects. When British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died in 2018, Vangelis composed a musical tribute for his interment that the ESA broadcast into space. Decca, the record label for his last three albums, called the composer ""a genius."" ""Vangelis created music of extraordinary originality and power, and provided the soundtrack to so many of our lives,"" it said. ""Decca had the pleasure of partnering with Vangelis and his team for his past three albums and we will miss him enormously. His music will live on forever.""

69,Australian star Cameron Smith starts well in US PGA with birdie masterclass,world," Sport US PGA Championship: Cameron Smith starts in Tulsa as Rory McIlroy takes the early lead Cameron Smith has delivered a ball-striking masterclass to live up to his billing as one of the favourites for the US PGA Championship in Oklahoma. Smith posted a birdie-filled two-under-par 68 to trail clubhouse leader Rory McIlroy by three shots after his first round at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa. Australia's world number four leads the PGA Tour for birdies this season, with an average of 5.38 a round. And he led the field on Thursday, too, with seven more birdies, all coming from inside three metres. ""I really like the golf course. I hit my driver really good today, which freed me up into the greens, and was able to make a few birdies there on the back nine,"" Smith said. ""Just need to keep hitting fairways. My irons and putting feels really good, just keep those birdie looks coming."" Smith also missed three putts from between seven and 10 feet. But his back-nine blitz of five birdies in seven holes at least saved The Players champion from shooting over par after he reached the turn at two-over. Smith was in a tie for sixth when he completed his round. McIlroy was alone on top at five-under, the former world number one and four-time major champion holding a one-shot lead over Smith's playing partner, Will Zalatoris, and fellow American Tom Hoge. Matt Kuchar and Abraham Ancer were sharing fourth after firing three-under 67s. Veteran John Daly also caught the attention of the crowd, sitting two shots off the lead for almost an hour of play, before fading to go two-over. Starting on the 10th, Smith could barely believe he missed a birdie start after his putt hung over the lip of the hole. He waited as long as he could but the ball would not drop, and he had to settle for par before rebounding with a birdie on the 11th with a laser approach to the par three. But after missing the fairway right off the tee on 12, Smith went from rough to rough to card a dreaded double bogey and give up two shots. He birdied with the par-five 13th to return to even par, only to drop successive shots on 16 and 17. Smith's brilliant fightback began with three consecutive birdies to open his inward nine and surge back into red figures. Forced to lay up on the par-five fifth after finding a fairway off the tee, Smith produced the shot of the day to set up his sixth and most unlikely birdie, almost holing out for eagle from 215 yards. He picked up another shot on the seventh to climb to three-under, only to drop a shot on the brutal par-three eighth after finding a trap and being unable to get up and down. Australia's two other morning starters — Cam Davis (72) and Matt Jones (73) — were seven and eight shots behind McIlroy, respectively. Former champion Jason Day, Adam Scott, Marc Leishman, Min Woo Lee and Lucas Herbert all had afternoon tee times.
