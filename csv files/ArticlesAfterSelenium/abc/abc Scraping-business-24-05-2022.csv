0,The first challenge facing Albanese is to restore Australia's economy,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For all the Coalition's boasts about superior economic management, Anthony Albanese's primary task will be to navigate his new government through the minefield bequeathed to him by his predecessors. Mounting deficits, a mountain of debt, an overstimulated economy and ill-disciplined spending are all operating in a macro-economic environment that no longer reacts or behaves the way the textbooks say it should. That will be no easy task. After almost a decade in government without ever once producing a budget surplus — despite promises to the contrary — the Coalition managed to double the nation's debt even before the pandemic hit. Its legacy? At least another decade of deficits and a trillion-dollar national debt. Ideology often trumped economics as the Coalition repeatedly shut off sources of revenue and added billions of dollars of unnecessary expenditure. It canned the mining tax after politicising it as an evil. In the process, it denied generations of Australians their rightful inheritance and — instead of investing in health, education and aged care — transferred the proceeds to foreign investors. Then there was the carbon tax. It dumped the Gillard government's revenue-neutral carbon price and replaced it with a massive and inefficient subsidy, handing out billions of dollars to polluters in a scheme that now has been transformed into… a carbon price. And while it could rightly claim credit for shielding much of the country from the ravages of the worst recession in a century, it did so via a $90 billion scheme, Jobkeeper, that hosed extraordinary amounts of cash onto a large number of recipients who simply didn't need it. Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues That cash — along with an additional $240 billion COVID spending — has helped ignite an inflationary tinderbox. And, as a parting gift, the stage-three tax cuts — now endorsed by the incoming Albanese government — will strip $37 billion a year from revenue by early next decade, line the pockets of middle and high-income earners and turbo-charge inflation. More on that later. It is difficult enough to try to fix the mistakes of others. In some cases, such as the mining tax, it just isn't worth the political mileage to revisit old battlegrounds. But what do you do when all the old rules no longer apply? Two cornerstones of economic theory appear to have come adrift in recent times that will make life ever tougher for the new government. Both revolve around inflation: one the relationship between wages and inflation and the other, economic growth and inflation. For 30 years, consumer prices for everyday goods have been in check. Suddenly, they're surging out of control and most of the current crop of politicians and monetary chiefs are in unfamiliar territory. For years, the Reserve Bank was being castigated for not generating enough inflation. Suddenly, now, there's way too much. Wages, however, have remained stubbornly subdued, squeezing spending power in what essentially is a real pay-cut. Boosting workers' wages by 5 per cent – for all workers, not just those on the minimum wage — would lead to an increase in prices across the economy of about 2 per cent, according to a new report. It became one of the defining issues of the election: pressures around the cost of living. The burning question was whether the minimum wage should be raised to the same extent as the cost of consumer items. As the election entered its final week, two days of data drops from the Bureau of Statistics were supposed to resolve the battle. Everyone expected to see a lift-off in wages. The RBA had even taken the unusual step of raising interest rates during the election campaign in anticipation. Except, it didn't happen. When the data emerged, we saw the lowest unemployment in 48 years at just 3.9 per cent. With inflation powering ahead at 5.1 per cent, wages should have shown at least some early signs of momentum. Instead, the gulf between consumer prices and earnings widened as wages grew by just 2.4 per cent. It was a devastating blow for Scott Morrison, but now becomes an enormous challenge for Anthony Albanese. It was also an unnerving week for economists. According to what's known as the Phillips Curve, wages are supposed to rise when unemployment drops. Part of the accepted economic wisdom, it was a theory formulated by a Kiwi, A. William Phillips — who worked as a crocodile hunter in Australia before a groundbreaking stint at the London School of Economics in the 1950s. His theory makes perfect sense. When there's a shortage of workers due to low unemployment, business owners are forced to offer more money to attract employees. In tough times, when a lot of people are out of work, wages stagnate. But for much of the past decade, wages have been decoupling from employment. Somewhere around 2011, just after the Global Financial Crisis, the relationship began to break down in Australia. As the economy recovered, the Reserve Bank predicted wages growth would return. The graph below charts the RBA predictions each year against what actually happened. Instead of growing in 2011, wages growth slumped. So, the next year, the RBA figured it merely had been delayed and made a similar prediction for 2012. It didn't happen again. Increasingly desperate and exasperated, the RBA boffins repeated the projections each and every year for the next six years. Full marks for perseverance. There's no clear answer to why wages are stuck in neutral. The RBA postulated that employers were offering other incentives, such as one-off bonuses, extra days off and other benefits. Anything except permanent pay rises. Perhaps the reason it can do this is that the jobs market is not an entirely free market. It is governed by tight laws, particularly around industrial action. Our industrial relations system has been designed specifically to keep wages under control. Australian workers saw their base wages rise 2.4 per cent over the past year, but high inflation meant they took a large real pay cut. From industrial chaos in the 1970s, strike action and industrial disputes have fallen to negligible levels. Private sector wages have been restrained by Enterprise Bargaining Agreements while state governments have kept pay rises in check. Unwinding those arrangements would be nigh on impossible, meaning sustained wage rises in Australia are highly unlikely any time soon. After a year of making himself and the opposition a small target, however, the incoming prime minister took the unusual step of attaching a number to the upcoming tribunal deliberations on the minimum wage. Less than a fortnight out from the election, Mr Albanese nailed his colours to the mast, saying he ""absolutely"" supported a 5.1 per cent pay rise for the 2 per cent of workers on the minimum wage. Mr Morrison was quick to respond, backed up by many in the business community. Such an increase, he said, was ""like throwing fuel on the fire of rising interest rates and rising costs of living"". There's no doubt wage rises fuel inflation. But, if limited to those earning the bare minimum, they would be negligible. Wage rises deliver more spending power, adding to inflation. But so too, do tax cuts. And when it comes to inflationary pressure, the mammoth restructuring of our income tax system in 2024 will deliver it in spades. The Parliamentary Budget Office delivered its verdict a fortnight ago on the stage-three cuts, pushing up the overall cost by a further $22 billion. All up, the tax cuts will inject $206 billion into middle and upper-income earners' pockets in just its first eight years of operation. If consumer prices are still rising at this pace, that's going to force interest rates much higher. Fuel on the inflationary fire? Or scorched earth?

1,ASX edges higher as new Labor PM Albanese sworn in and global equity markets rebound,business,"  ASX edges higher as new Labor PM Albanese sworn in and global equity markets rebound Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian shares have finished the day slightly higher, while Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese was sworn in as the country's 31st prime minister after nine years of rule by the conservative Coalition. ASX 200 closed up 0.1 per cent to 7,149. The All Ordinaries gained 8 points or 0.1 per cent to 7,399. Mr Albanese promised a ""journey of change"" as he vowed to tackle climate change, rising living costs and inequality. On the share market, miners climbed 0.8 per cent and touched a more-than-two-week high after iron ore prices surged on Friday. BHP Group, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group rose between 1.1 per cent and 2.8 per cent. Incitec Pivot was down 3.7 per cent after surging as much as 7.5 per cent when the fertiliser maker said it would spin off its explosives manufacturing and fertilisers businesses. Energy stocks added 0.3 per cent, benefiting from strong oil prices. Major oil and gas explorers Woodside and Santos gained 0.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively. Domestic technology stocks were up 0.4 per cent, despite Wall Street's weak finish last week. Block tumbled 2.4 per cent, while WiseTech Global gained 0.6 per cent. Financials shed 0.4 per cent, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group falling 0.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively. Among the top movers up were Codan (+14.5 per cent), Imugene (+12.5pc), Elders (+9.6 per cent) and A2 Milk (+3.5 per cent). The Australian dollar was also up, at 71.05 US cents at 04:27pm AEST. Global equity markets rebounded on Friday after the S&P 500 pared losses that briefly took it into bear market territory. China cut its prime rate for five-year loans, which influences mortgage prices, by 15 basis points in a reduction that was sharper than expected as authorities seek to cushion the impact of an economic slowdown. While a late-day rally on Friday stopped the S&P 500 from confirming a bear market, the gloom on Wall Street led the benchmark to fall for the seventh consecutive week, an event that has occurred only five times since 1928, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. How long the downdraft in equities lasts will depend on when inflation breaks, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""What really flummoxed investors this week, myself included, is when you have the types of companies that typically do well in economic softness, do terribly,"" Mr Tuz said, referring to poor earnings results at Walmart and Target. The S&P 500 closed up 0.01 per cent after being down 2.27 per cent at one point or below the level would confirm a bear market — a 20 per cent decline from its January 3 record closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite already in bear territory, fell 0.3 per cent. Equity valuations need to come down and the expected return on investments, the discount rate, needs to go up, said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Hermes. ""The market is starting to digest the idea that this might be a new world where the discount rate on risk assets is not zero anymore,"" Mr Auth said. ""You're seeing all these different areas of the market get pounded at the same time and it's just been very unsettling for investors,"" he added. MSCI's gauge of stocks in 47 countries closed up 0.37 per cent, but still fell for the seventh consecutive week, its longest losing streak since the index was launched in 1990. Earlier in Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 0.73 per cent. US Treasury yields fell for a third straight session on concerns about growth prospects. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes fell 6.5 basis points, to 2.79 per cent. Gold edged up, heading for its first week of gains in five weeks on persistent worries over economic growth and the dollar's decline over the week. Oil prices steadied, on course for little change for the week as a planned European Union ban on Russian oil balanced concerns that slowing economic growth would hurt demand. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US112.91 a barrel, by 10:36am AEST.

2,The Quad will be looking for signs Australia is serious about resetting. Can Albanese and Wong deliver?,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Extreme weather events are the new normal. The use of nuclear weapons by Vladimir Putin's Russian military is now a once-unthinkable possibility. And Xi Jinping's China, our largest trading partner and a rising superpower, is pulling down the shutters. So no pressure, then, for our freshly-minted 31st prime minister as he flies into the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in Tokyo this week. The immediate challenge facing incoming Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong is to reassure allies and friends of continuity and certainty. But more than that, the change of government presents an opportunity to build confidence in Australia's capacity, once taken for granted, for visionary leadership and humble decency. Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues The Quad involves India, Japan, the United States and Australia. It began in 2007, under George W Bush and John Howard, but Australia pulled back under Kevin Rudd because of concerns about America's approach to China. The Labor leader is officially sworn in as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia, ahead of a trip to Tokyo to meet with Quad leaders. Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull revived the arrangement in 2017 as concerns mounted about China's military expansion in the South China Sea. In March 2021 the Quad leaders issued a joint statement. ""The Spirit of the Quad"" spoke of a ""rules-based maritime order in the East and South China seas"" that supported a ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific"". At this week's meetings, Japan and India will be looking for signs Australia is serious about engaging with Asia. Another old friend with deep and long-established links in Asia — France — will be looking for signs of a reset. The US will be reviewing its expectations of what Australia, under a Labor government, is prepared to contribute to both the Quad security dialogue and to the AUKUS trilateral security pact. Albanese and Wong share much in common with US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Their face-to-face meetings this week in Tokyo have the potential to reset the allies' approach to China and the Indo-Pacific well beyond what was likely or even possible under Donald Trump and Scott Morrison. One of the greatest challenges of our time is to reverse the slide in relations between China and the West. The stakes are immense, not just for defence and security, or trade and the economy, but also global responses to climate change, the future course of Chinese society and the lives of 1.4 billion people. Biden and Blinken will also be looking for signs that the new Albanese Labor government is as committed to AUKUS as was the Morrison government. The revelation last week that, contrary to expectations in Washington DC, Labor was not consulted about AUKUS, raised doubts about the functioning of the security pact. The operational details of how AUKUS could transform our immediate security environment have also not been fully spelt out. As with the Quad, the potential benefits, and threats, to Australia go well beyond hard-core defence and security issues. For decades, Australia's engagement with Asia has lacked the sustained investment of financial, political, and social capital that is needed. Albanese says he wants to change this, singling out Indonesia as a key priority for his government. Despite living on the edge of the largest and fastest-developing economies and societies on the planet, Australia has been far too lazy, short-sighted, and miserly about truly engaging with Asia. Our current woes with Chinese trade bans point to a failure to engage more broadly with both China and the rest of Asia. Under Penny Wong, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has the potential to play a critical role in securing Australia's broader security interests. Wong's personal backstory, as well as her formidable intellect, will be key assets in our engagement with Asia. The challenges facing the new defence minister — understood to be Richard Marles — intersect tightly with those facing Wong. The shocking invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the unexpected course of the war, contain many lessons for Australia. The first is the importance of international alliances and institutions, such as NATO and the European Union. Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it was easy to be critical of NATO and the EU, and question their utility and substance. Not any more. The Quad, AUKUS, ANZUS and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, together with ASEAN, are very different entities to NATO and the EU, but the war in Ukraine casts them in a fresh light. Diplomacy, trust and relationship-building are as critically important to defence and security as tanks, trucks and planes. Australia's next Defence White Paper, likely to be released in 2023, is going to be shaped by both the rise of China and the decline of Russia. The experiences of the war in Ukraine, the critical role of logistics, the utility of certain kinds of equipment such as tanks and the impact of organisational culture will be closely studied. In all of this, there are challenges as well as great opportunities for Australia. Already it is clear that intelligence, IT and drones have played a critical role in the defence of Ukraine. Australia has considerable capacity to innovate and develop related critical systems, hardware and technology to the benefit of both national and regional security. It should go without saying that Australia needs to both prepare for war and to do everything that it possibly can to avoid war. The latter depends very much on the former, together with diplomacy and relationship building. War, in the worst-case scenario, constitutes an existential threat. So too does climate change. The remarkable outcomes of the 2022 federal elections point to the realisation of millions of Australians that more frequent and severe fire, flood, drought and intense heat events represent an immediate security threat. The way Australians regard the two-party system has changed — for both sides of the aisle. Here are some of the factors that contributed to Saturday's election result. Neither the LNP nor Labor intended for this to be a climate election. But it clearly was. This was an instance of ordinary voters being well ahead of the leaders of the two larger parties. The impacts of climate change will contribute directly to political and social stability in our region. Crises in food and water security, rising sea levels and severe weather events and an increased impact of animal-to-human diseases such as COVID-19, mean that responses to climate change are integral to managing national and regional security. The nation and the region are watching and looking to the new Australian government for leadership on security and this includes climate change.

3,The final warning for Morrison fell on deaf ears. Now women have voted him out,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Scott Morrison can't say he wasn't warned that women were angry. But will the next Liberal leader heed the lessons Morrison ignored? The history of human congress is littered with the stories of men who wake up to Dear John letters after years of not listening properly when the women in their lives say they're unhappy. But Scott Morrison – who received God knows how many final warnings from Australian women over the past year but chose every time to continue bulldozing happily along — seems to have achieved something novel, having unmistakably on Saturday night received a John Deere letter. Morrison's bulldozing ways are central to this upheaval in the political landscape and to the damage done to the Liberal Party. Much of central Melbourne has been purged of Liberal men, replaced significantly by members of the fastest-growing single demographic in Australia, which for some reason unknown to modern political science also was the group most consistently ignored and talked-down to by Scott Morrison: professional women. The rout in Melbourne claimed Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and high-profile  junior minister Tim Wilson. It sent Peter Costello's old seat of Higgins to Labor for the first time ever, and seriously threatened Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar. ""At least Alan Tudge survived. That's the important thing, I suppose,"" quipped one ashen-faced Liberal on Saturday night. Tudge (the question of whose membership or otherwise of the cabinet has now been firmly settled by the Australian people) suffered a primary vote swing against him in Aston of about 11 per cent, but will make it out of this parched Death Valley of disapproval on his hands and knees, surviving on a malodorous cocktail of One Nation, Clive Palmer and Liberal Democrats preferences. In NSW, Sydney Harbour now wears a teal collar: North Sydney, Warringah, Mackellar and (though it's close) possibly Wentworth too. Central Brisbane's gone Green. And in Western Australia, a staggering 11 per cent slump in the Coalition's primary vote was paid out lavishly to Labor — which collected Swan, Pearce and Hasluck. It ousted Scott Morrison's confidant Ben Morton, in ""safe"" Tangney, thanks to Labor candidate Sam Lim, a dolphin trainer who speaks 10 languages. And Julie Bishop's old seat of Curtin — another treasure once much squabbled-over by Liberal aspirants — now joins the teal ranks, in the hands of lawyer, consultant and mum-of-three Kate Chaney. ""Women did not see their concerns and interests reflected in a party led by Scott Morrison in coalition with Barnaby Joyce,"" said Julie Bishop on the Nine network on Saturday night. Well, the question has to be asked: Why? Scott Morrison, feted within his party as a tactical campaign genius, missed chance after chance to notice what was going on with Australian women. And it's not like it was that hard to spot. When COVID-19 hit, who was simultaneously the most likely to lose paid work and the most likely to take on more unpaid work? Women. Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues Who was more likely to work in the low-paid sectors of whom Australia asked so much in the pandemic — aged care workers, cleaners, teachers? Women. Child care was the first sector pulled off JobKeeper. Who works in child care centres? Women. Who did the lion's share of supervising children in lockdown, caring for elderly relatives, and coping with the explosion of anxiety and despair among adolescents? Metrics abound to confirm that it was women, again. But when Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg presented their first COVID Budget, where was it aimed? At construction and manufacturing, significantly; male dominated sectors that were less badly hit by COVID-19, but more generously helped. Then came the shock wave of Brittany Higgins's disclosure of her alleged experiences in Parliament House. Women's disgust at the culture of Australia's Parliament spilled over into the streets in protests around Australia. Morrison — after having to be nudged by his wife Jenny — expressed sympathy for Higgins, but later piously reminded the marchers how lucky they were to be living in a country where protesters were not shot. None of these instances of prime ministerial cloth-earedness is a hanging offence, of course. But people learn about their prime ministers by watching how they respond under pressure. And observers of Scott Morrison this term could not possibly have missed that here was a man happy to force out a female CEO for handing out $20,000 worth of watches to high-achieving executives, while enforcing no consequences at all for the chain of blokes (including himself) who managed to blow $1.8 billion AND ruin lives on the grotesquely mishandled Robodebt. Last March, amid the storm of revelations about parliamentary culture, Morrison staged a press conference at which he said he had been ""doing a lot of listening over this past month"". ""I have heard about being marginalised, women being intimidated, women being belittled, women being diminished, and women being objectified. That is not OK. ""Women who are afraid to walk to their car from the train, and they carry their keys in their hand like a knife for fear of being attacked. That is not OK. That is not acceptable. ""These events have triggered, right across this building and indeed right across the country, women who have put up with this rubbish and this crap for their entire lives, as their mothers did, as their grandmothers did."" Morrison said he was sympathetic to the idea of a quota for the preselection of women in the Liberal Party. And then: Nothing. Preselections in his own state of NSW, as you may recall, devolved into an ugly, venal, factional dirt-fight among (largely) Liberal Party men determined not to let each other get the upper hand. The result? Many seats where the Liberal Party didn't even select a candidate until the election (whose timing was, keep in mind, also set by the Prime Minister) in an epic act of rudeness and arrogance to voters in those seats. In Warringah, the hand-picked candidate was Katherine Deves, a woman whose crusade on trans women in sport was applauded by Scott Morrison, though he distanced himself from some of her more deranged remarks. To the extent that Morrison explicitly mentioned women during the campaign, it was often to support the defence of women's sport, as argued by Deves and by the Tasmanian Liberal Senator Claire Chandler, whose private members bill to exclude trans women from women's sport Morrison warmly supported. And fine: It's perfectly reasonable to discuss these matters. But for a prime minister who promised $150m last election for the ""Female Facilities And Water Safety Stream"" to build much-needed change rooms for women in venues where only the blokes have showers and toilets, and then blew 80 per cent of that money on swimming pools for 11 Liberal and National electorates, the sudden conviction that the real problem for sporting women is the potential of a trans teammate is — well, a lot. As the Prime Minister fanned out over Australia campaigning in his famously image-rich style, it became clear that he was doubling down on his decision to chase the bloke vote. An analysis by the Financial Review at the one-month mark established that Morrison heavily favoured manufacturing locations for photo opportunities. Fifteen of those, compared to seven community events. Anthony Albanese, on the other hand, favoured photo-ops with health and care workers. This may seem trivial — and the Labor leader had his fair share of high-vis too — but there is no accident in the planning of campaign visuals. We see what they want us to see, and Morrison wanted us to see him in high-vis. And of course women work in high-vis too, but not to the same extent that men do. To the external eye, it looked like a deliberate strategic gamble; that the PM believed he could afford to burn professional women (and possibly some leafy Liberal seats) because he'd capture blue-collar men in outer suburban areas. Liberal vote-druids briefed that ""the trans stuff"" was absolutely hoovering up votes in religious and socially conservative communities in Labor-held seats. Except that when the votes rolled in on Saturday night, there was very little evidence of anything of the kind. Is a nasty campaign tactic rendered even nastier by the fact that it didn't work? I don't know, but this little frolic — sponsored enthusiastically by Australia's 30th Prime Minister — was an exercise in profound awfulness. (Worth reflecting, too, on just who will be doing the emotional work now of reassuring the young people affected by this campaign stunt, telling them they're okay and that they are welcome to play sport. Who will be doing that stuff? You know the answer.) The truly astounding part of this story is that there were good things Scott Morrison could have said to women. He had more women in his Cabinet than ever before. They've committed billions to aged care and to child care, eventually, and made some valuable inroads to mental health and domestic violence services. He has some excellent female ministers, with whom he did not campaign enough. But when Morrison spoke every day at his press conferences — usually they come with an introductory piece of oratory about whatever is top of mind that day for the PM – he did not make any perceptible effort to address areas of interest to women. The air on Saturday night was thick and feathery with chickens coming home to roost. Seats with large numbers of Chinese-born voters, like Chisholm and Bennelong, swung hard against the government. Polling in the Chinese language Sydney Today suggested that Chinese-born Australians were not big fans of Defence Minister Peter Dutton's advice to Australians to ""prepare for war"". ACT Liberal Senator Zed Seselja — though counting continues — looks as though he might lose his seat, an unprecedented result surely related to the PM's airy promise last week to further fillet the public service. It cannot be a coincidence that the population of Western Australia — who Morrison last year dismissed as cave people because they secured the borders to their state — gave him an historic clubbing, with a swing of 11 per cent. When Leigh Sales asked Scott Morrison in the final week about the threat to the government in the ""teal"" seats, he replied in effect that voters in those seats were rich enough not to have to worry about real issues. ""Many of these places, I suppose, are less vulnerable to the impacts of the economy than, say, many of the places I've been in this campaign."" As we know, there's nothing women love more than a bloke telling them they don't know what they're talking about. The response on election night to these sentiments was unmistakeable. And Scott Morrison, just over a year after he declared himself open to a quota system, has presided over a campaign that cut the number of Liberal female MPs in the house of representatives from 13 to 6. It's difficult not to feel sorry for the departing Liberal women and for the Liberal moderates who lost their seats on Saturday night. They were punished for a set of circumstances not of their making. But I suspect every time Tim Wilson or Josh Frydenberg or Jason Falinski screamed about how much money their opponents were spending, or complained about how unfair it all was on them, or moaned that teal posters were being stuck up everywhere, it made things worse not better. And every time the teal independents were attacked as vacuous, or hypocritical, or hapless pawns of a powerful man, that made things worse too, because they likely reminded the professional woman listening of a time when things like that have been said about her. Those MPs were vulnerable because their party neglected for years to fix its relationship with women. And neglected for years to come to a sensible compromise on addressing climate change, rather than fighting like ferrets in a bag. And the overriding message of this campaign isn't really about Liberal or Labor. It's that local communities are tired of political bullshit. They don't want big parties to take their votes for granted — whether it's parachuting a high-profile external candidate in at the last minute, or refusing to do anything about aircraft noise (a powerful local issue that seems to have cost both the majors in the Queensland seats of Brisbane, Griffith, Ryan and Dickson). There's a massive lesson there to be learned. Are the right people listening?

4,"If you think your home build could be in doubt, here's what your next steps should be",business,"  If you think your home build could be in doubt, here's what your next steps should be Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Matt Stahl heard rumours about the financial stability of Australia's largest building company Metricon this week, his heart sank. The landscaper had saved since he was a teenager to pay a $17,500 deposit to build his first home on a 981-square-metre block in the quaint township of Campbells Creek. His block is about a 10-minute drive through billabong-dotted historical goldfields from Castlemaine in central Victoria. Permit approval and preliminary work were ahead of schedule and construction was due to break ground in early June, but talk about Metricon being under pressure left Mr Stahl feeling like the roof was caving in on his dream. ""I was able to get on the phone to the person I speak to with Metricon and I have been reassured that things aren't as bad as what people are saying,"" Mr Stahl said. Some of the rumours were sparked by the death of Metricon chief executive and founder Mario Biasin on Monday, and prompted the company to meet with Victorian government representatives. Amid industry-wide challenges in construction and speculation amplified by media coverage, the company's acting chief executive Peter Langfelder called a press conference to put the rumours to bed. ""We're in a really strong, viable position, we've got the support of our banks, we've got headroom available,"" he said. But away from the spotlight cast on Australia's biggest home builder, pressures on the industry exacerbated by the COVID pandemic have been well-documented. Amid issues such as rising costs, supply constraints and soaring sub-contractor fees, some big firms have already gone under, such as Probuild and Privium. Master Builders Victoria's Michaela Lihou said yesterday some businesses were being forced to ""walk away from the industry"". ""We've got insolvencies going on. We're trying our best to protect the industry,"" she said. So what should you do if you're not so lucky, and your dream of building a home becomes a nightmare? Since the Metricon speculation hit the headlines, the national not-for-profit legal program Justice Connect has seen a 140 per cent increase in traffic to its online guide for what to do in case of builder insolvency. If you think your builder is having financial troubles, you should check your building contract or permits to confirm the correct name of your builder or the registered name of the company. The Australian Bankrupty Register can be used to check whether a sole trader or a building partnership has collapsed, while the ASIC register will tell you if a company has been deregistered or insolvent. If your fears are confirmed, your next immediate step is to access the details of the Domestic Building Insurance that is included in your building contract. Every state and territory, except Tasmania, requires building companies to have insurance for defective or incomplete work due to insolvency. The building contract will list all the insurance information you need, including the policy number, to make a claim. In some states, this will be done through statutory authority while others require you to contact insurance companies directly. Here are the best contacts for each part of Australia: Your state authority will also need copies of your builder's invoices, receipts or bank statements as proof of payments, and a list of incomplete work you are claiming. If you cannot find details of the insurer, or it appears that your builder may not have insurance, you should still contact your state authority for help. The authority will assess your claim and send out a building consultant to visit your property and inspect what work is needed. You may be asked get quotes from a new builder of your choice, or the authority may do that on your behalf and will then decide what it will pay out to complete the work. Justice Connect chief executive Chris Povey says if you don't agree with the assessments by the authority or the insurer, the next step is to go to a tribunal. ""That's just more stress and anxiety,"" he said. ""I mean, you're dealing with people's biggest investment."" Going to the tribunal can be time consuming and very costly. Groups like Justice Connect offer help for what it calls ""the missing middle"" — those who can't afford to pay for a lawyer but earn too much to qualify for pro bono representation or legal aid. ""Legal help is out of reach for most Australians so it's really not ideal that people end up before a tribunal,"" Mr Povey said. ""We're in the middle of pretty much a housing crisis. ""The law needs to be as accessible as possible. It's good that there is insurance coverage but there still is a need for people to have support through the process."" Mr Povey says he has concerns about how people will secure a new builder during the labour and construction supplies squeeze. ""Realistically speaking, what is the likelihood that they're going to have somebody pick up a half done job?,"" he asked. ""And what is the cost of that going to be? ""I don't like people's chances changing horses halfway through and we're going to have to think deeply about that in the weeks and months to come as more builders come under pressure.""

5,Plant milk booms in Aussie cafes. Should dairy farmers be worried?,business," ABC Rural Plant-based milk set to overtake cows' milk in Australian cafes — and oat milk is coming out on top Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Plant-based milk may soon fill half of all drinks in Australian cafes as dairy alternatives skyrocket in popularity, with oat milk leading the charge. Barista Daylen Tuckford started working at a cafe in Williams, Western Australia, two years ago. In that time, they've seen oat milk arrive and watched its popularity boom. ""Probably a year or so ago — halfway through the year I think — oat milk just started really taking over,"" they said. A survey of more than 900 cafes found a quarter of Australians chose plant milk in 2021 and that the most popular option was almond, followed by soy and oat. Cafe market analyst Sean Edwards said plant milk was on track to capture half the cafe drinks market in the next few years, and oat could soon be Australia's top-selling dairy alternative. ""Two years ago oat milk was 0.2 per cent, now it's 20 per cent of the market,"" Mr Edwards said. ""Oat will be number one very shortly. In the next six to 12 months you'll find oat will take over from almond. ""It's mostly because when people try oat they see the silkiness and smoothness of the drink. It emulates dairy better than most other plant milks."" While oat milk's creamy texture and mild flavour may have endeared it to customers, dairy farmers were less impressed. ""It's falsifying a product to make it seem like a product which is popular. You don't win the market otherwise,"" WAFarmers dairy president Ian Noakes said. Despite years of campaigning from the dairy industry, plant-based milks are not restricted from using dairy terms like ""milk"" and ""creamy"" in their labelling. This February, a Senate inquiry recommended the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission restrict the use of meat labels like ""beef"", ""pork"" or ""chicken"" for plant protein products but stopped short of recommending dairy descriptors be restricted. Plant-based food products should not use words like ""beef"" and ""chicken"", nor use images of animals on packaging, according to recommendations from a Senate inquiry. Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows Australians' dairy milk consumption is relatively steady despite plant milk's 43 per cent rise over three years. Mr Edwards said plant milk's rapid growth wasn't coming at the expense of dairy. ""I don't think dairy has lost ground in volume, but they've lost market share,"" he said. ""There's been some massive coffee consumption going over COVID. The home market has been really strong."" Nonetheless, Mr Noakes said dairy farmers were concerned by the shifting trend. ""There's no doubt that people have moved away from dairy because of a perception of carbon [emissions],"" he said. ""But as an industry we're working very hard to lower our carbon footprint. ""To those people I would say give us a break. We will get there."" The sharp rise in oat milk sales has opened the door for Australian farmers and processors to jump onboard. Late last year, Wide Open Agriculture secured $20 million to build WA's first oat milk processing facility in Perth. While the oats it uses in its milk product are grown and milled in WA, the processing took place in Italy before milk was shipped back to Australian supermarkets and cafes. Chief executive Ben Cole said the Perth facility was the final step necessary to producing oat milk entirely within the state. ""It's [about] provenance and risk management. You don't have long supply chains, you don't have currency disruptions or disruptions related to pandemics and now war in Europe,"" he said. Steven Ford, one of two WA farmers selling oats to Wide Open Agriculture for oat milk, expected many more farms would be needed to supply the new facility. His oats are sold at a premium and marketed as ""regeneratively grown"" because he farms with fewer pesticides and fungicides than most WA farms. ""If the consumer wants plant-based milks, if they can be grown in WA and processed in WA and create opportunities for WA people, that's a great thing,"" he said. ""If those premiums are there and are large enough it will give us farmers the opportunities to perhaps investigate these principles of farming further and produce food with perhaps more integrity. ""I've got four boys and if they all want to go farming, we may have to look at those things going forward."" Plant milk's surge in popularity has coincided with significant investment in making it tastier and easier to use in cafes. Michael Perich is chief executive of Noumi, which sells dairy, lactose-free and plant-based milk under the Milklab and Australia's Own brands. ""We've been able to [make] the foam and froth work on the milk where previously there were problems with [plant-based milk] splitting,"" he said. ""It's a result of better processes, better technology to make sure it can be more closely aligned with a dairy milk."" Daylen Tuckford said the proliferation of plant milk was a challenge to master. ""You can really tell sometimes when you're using alternative milks. Some separate a lot easier and some brands froth a lot nicer,"" they said.

6,"Bedrooms the size of closets, no repairs and a lot of mould: Welcome to Sydney's nightmare rental market",business,"  Sydney has become a landlords' market and desperate renters are paying the price Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Long searches, skyrocketing prices, and diminishing quality. Sydney has become a landlord’s market, and desperate renters are paying the price. Advertised bedrooms that are no bigger than closets. A stair railing hanging loose from the wall. Bathrooms that don't have a door. Mould — and a lot of it. None of these details mentioned on recent rental listings asking for upwards of $1,000 in rent a week. For people who haven't been on a rental hunt in a while, this might sound like a horror story. But for those looking for a somewhat affordable home in Sydney's inner-city suburbs, it's a Saturday morning bingo card. Here's how it often plays out. Before you're even through the door, you'll be standing alongside up to 30 other hopefuls. You'll then be shuttled through the property, back to back, elbow to elbow, in an allotted 15 minutes. In the end, you find out at least three other groups have already offered above the asking price. And then, with fingers crossed, it's straight on to the next inspection. Rental vacancy rates across Greater Sydney dropped to 1.4 per cent in April, according to Domain, with the number of vacant rentals halved in the three months between December and March. Meanwhile, the median weekly asking price for a rental house is at a record high. In other words, Sydney is currently what you call a ""landlords' market"". Across the country, most states are seeing similar surges. According to Domain's latest rental report, the median price for house in Australian capital cities rose to $508 in the first three months of the year — the highest it's ever been. It's a far cry from the height of the pandemic, when the lack of international migration drove down rental prices and drastically increased vacancy rates. Across Greater Sydney, the vacancy rate peaked at 3.8 in April 2020, with similar highs recorded later in the pandemic. The impact of the current boom is palpable at rental inspections, as prospective tenants share stories of long searches, budgets above what they can afford to pay, and disappointment at the quality of what's available in their price range. And the crisis is not confined to the inner city. Mary Thoms has been looking for a property for herself and two young grandchildren in the Liverpool area since Christmas last year. At this point, she says she'll take whatever she can get. ""Waking up early in the morning, the first thing is that thought: get a house, a place, so you can have a roof over your head."" ""Every Friday I'm looking at Domain to see if there are any good houses or even units, that are three-bedroom and spacious."" ""But at the inspections, there's a lot of people, so you get rejected. It's heartache, I'm just tired of looking."" We speak to Mary outside an inspection for a four-bedroom townhouse in Casula in Sydney's west. At $580 a week, it's above the median price for the suburb — but well below the cost in suburbs closer to the CBD. The grandmother is currently living in a unit in Blacktown, which has been plagued with break-ins and maintenance issues that have not been fixed. Even though the price is above what she would like to pay, Mary says she's going to apply for the property. But she's not feeling optimistic. ""They're all going to apply,"" she says, referring to the handful of other groups there for the inspection. ""So we're going to apply, too."" The real estate agent also expects the property to go quickly; it's a modern family home with a yard, located right near Casula Public School. It's exactly the type of property currently in short supply and high demand in south-west Sydney, according to Michael Busdon, the property manager at Raine and Horne Liverpool. ""During the pandemic, house rentals increased and apartment rentals dropped, and we had to offer people rent reductions in order for them not to vacate their apartments,"" he says. ""It seems that house rental hopes have bolted a little, and now apartments are having their turn."" In a ""normal market"", he says, you would usually expect between five and eight people at a house inspection in his area. Now when a house is on the market, assuming it's in good condition and well-located, it's in excess of 16. To explain this you only need to look at the real estate's print-out of available properties; during the pandemic, it was four to five double-sided pages long — now it's down to one page, front and back. ""I have seen it worse than this,"" he says, referring to the early 2000s, when people would submit their application forms with cash attached ""as a bribe"". Thankfully, he hasn't seen that happen this time around, but adds: ""This could be just the beginning"". Unlike those queuing up for inspections, Michael doesn't see the booming rental market as an entirely bad thing. ""It depends what side of the fence you are on,"" he says, ""if you're a tenant, you're probably not liking what is happening, if you're a landlord, you're probably feeling a little bit relieved."" That's because for the first time in years, as migrants return to Sydney after border closures and renters get back to business as usual, landlords are in a position to increase rents — just as the reserve bank lifts interest rates for the first time in 11 years, adding to the monthly cost of mortgages. While there are major differences between the city rental market compared to the outer suburbs — the median rental price for a house in Blacktown in Sydney's west is exactly half that of the inner-city suburb of Surry Hills — Michael sees it as more of a continuum: when vacancy rates drop in the city centre, people start to nudge outwards out of desperation, eventually driving up prices and demand elsewhere. ""Gentrification happens in the rental market too,"" he says. Even with the push outwards, many are still scrambling to be close to the city whether it be for work, lifestyle, or convenience. Especially as prices increase across the board. ""I'm in the Campbelltown area which is just as expensive as the inner west,"" says 20-year-old Laila Sumner. ""I'm in a one-bedroom that doesn't even have a proper bathroom, just a toilet and a shower, and I still pay $300 a week."" Laila is hoping to move to the inner west with her partner to be closer to her job in the city, but outside an inspection for a two-bedroom apartment in a nondescript, red-brick building in Marrickville, the pair aren't optimistic about their options. ""The first place we looked at was a bit of a slum, it smelt of mould,"" Shay Wilson, 22, says. ""It was a terrace house that had been broken up into four separate apartments. I was like, 'ah, maybe not'. Everyone walked in and then straight back out."" As for the Marrickville apartment, advertised for $430 a week, the review wasn't much better. While it fell within their $400 to $500 a week budget, it was old and severely lacking in built-in storage. ""It's almost like a guessing game,"" Laila says. ""Nothing seems like it's priced fairly at all — it's kind of like 'Oh I think people will pay this for that house, let's just put it at that'."" At the same inspection is 25-year-old Madison McGrail who has good reason to be looking for a new place: she's just broken up with her partner who she lives with in Redfern. But timing is not on her side; since her most recent move in June last year, she says there are fewer available options and the ones that tend to be lower quality — even with a bigger budget of $550 a week. ""It's just yucky apartments out here,"" she says. Of the six places she'd inspected so far, she hadn't applied for any. ""The level of quality that people think they can show houses in [isn't acceptable],"" she says. ""I was at one the other day, and I was like 'is this place going to get cleaned again before we move in?'."" Eirene Tsolidis-Noyce is the general secretary of the newly-formed Renters and Housing Union (RAHU). The organisation was formed in response to the COVID pandemic, in an urgent bid to ensure renters who lost work as a result of lockdowns were able to remain in their homes. But as the pandemic has progressed, and lockdowns have eased, their attention has turned to issues within the home. ""We have black mould, seriously urgent repairs, hot water that's not running, electricity that's gone wrong,"" she says. ""The broader trend is that the properties we are living in are not kept to a minimum standard and the responses we receive from agents on our own, as tenants, are not adequate."" The median rental price for a house across Australia's capital cities hit a new record high in the first three months of this year. But it's not just Australians bearing the brunt of soaring rental costs. The time frames set out for landlords to respond to repairs differs between states. In NSW, tenants can organise for any urgent repairs — including broken hot water systems, blocked toilets, gas leaks, and broken stoves — to be fixed themselves and be reimbursed if the cost is under $1,000 and the landlord had a reasonable opportunity to respond to the request. But when it comes to non-urgent repairs, such as a broken dishwasher or mould, there's no avenue for tenants to go it alone with a guarantee to get their money back. Eirene says these sorts of requests often go answered. Part of this comes down to the lack of property availability: there's no urgency to make expensive repairs or improvements when tenants know there are few other options. On Crown Street in the trendy inner-city suburb of Surry Hills, a crowd has gathered outside an impressive looking three-story Victorian terrace. Despite the drizzling weather, the group huddle under umbrellas cradling takeaway coffees from the myriad of cafes on the block. Listed at $1,200 a week for four bedrooms and two bathrooms, the property is the most expensive we visit. It's also the most busy; between 30 to 40 people eventually show up for the inspection. At least one group is quick to walk straight back out. ""In the photos it looks like it's got bright lights or it's in the middle of the day,"" says Scotty Bensley, who arrived in Sydney late last year from New York. ""But when you go in the house it's super dark. There's a bit of Photoshop work."" For about two months, Scotty has been on a ""mad hunt"" for a place with his two friends after his temporary accommodation in Pyrmont began leaking. The group are realistic about the cost of living in the inner city — they're looking at any and all suburbs surrounding the CBD, from Surry Hills and Paddington to Newtown and Marrickville — and each person is prepared to pay up to $400 a week for their room. The most-recent place they applied for they negotiated above the asking price, but so far, it hasn't been enough. ""We're all 29 and 28, working men, but I guess there's a perception of a party house, young guys — we just want to find somewhere to live,"" he says. Recent university graduate Lola Trajkovic is also at the inspection hoping to find a share house for herself and three friends. After landing a full-time job, it's the 22-year-old Northern Beaches resident's first foray into the rental market. She thought the house was nice, but after speaking with the real estate agent, she says she was told they expect people to offer above the asking price — excluding her from the race. ""We've been looking at property websites for a couple of months, and I've found that even in the past two months they've increased in price,"" she says. ""We haven't started applying yet, but we're expecting to have a lot of trouble."" ""Our expectation at the moment is that we'll start looking, then we'll reassess, we'll lower our standards, and come back and try again."" After a tough two years, real estate agent Tom Jones believes it's a positive time for landlords, many of who took a significant hit to their normal cash flow during the pandemic. This, he says, is because the cost of owning property in Sydney is also ""drastically high"". ""Even though these rents seem to be high for tenants, if you're an investor looking at it on a yield basis, it's still not a good return."" As the leasing and new business manager at Village Property, an agency that specialises in rentals across the Sydney metro area, north shore, southern suburbs, and Parramatta, Tom's witnessed firsthand what he calls ""a drastic change in the market"" that began towards the end of January summer holidays. But while that means good news for his clients, he's sympathetic to the plight of renters: ""It's definitely difficult in this market for renters to get their applications approved because there's a lot of options for landlords."" With more competition, Tom says applicants are finding innovative ways to get noticed. While many with the means go straight to the offering more money route, others are trying a more personal approach; some are calling agents directly ahead of time ""so they know who you are"", while others bring along printed out biographies or statements to the inspection. Talking points about inflation and interest rates delivered by politicians on mammoth salaries feel far removed from the reality of the cost of living crisis on the ground, as hundreds of new people turn to food banks to survive. But asked what the best thing applicants can do to secure the keys, Tom returns to old-school advice. ""If you're really good at submitting your application with all the documents and information, and have everything ready like your references and tenancy ledger, it makes it easier for us to present your application to the owner quicker,"" he says. ""[It's also] important to build that rapport at the inspection and let the agent know that you're interested, that way we know where to spend our time and efforts looking into things."" Two weeks after meeting Mary at the inspection in Casula, we give her a call to ask how she went with the application. As of last Saturday, she hadn't heard anything back. ""It's pretty disheartening when you don't hear from them,"" she says. ""It gets so exhausting that you say you'll take whatever, but still that's not even happening. It's just waiting, waiting, waiting, and then you continue the search."" She's since widened her radius, meaning she'll be looking at places further away from where her children live. But she's desperate, and there's a deadline looming: her grandson is celebrating his third birthday in June and she'd like to do something nice in a new home. ""It's all about the children, as long as I have a nice place for the children,"" she says. ""But finding a decent one is like winning the lottery.""

7,China's third largest developer just defaulted — and the worst may be yet to come,business,"  Chinese developer Sunac defaults as Beijing struggles to save the trillion-dollar sector Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog About a year ago, Chinese billionaire Sun Hongbin was certain that his luxury real estate company Sunac China would never ""bomb"". Last week, his firm — China's third-largest developer — defaulted, missing the deadline for coupon payments on a $US742 million ($1.1 billion) offshore bond. Unlike Evergrande, which defaulted in December last year, Sunac appeared to be financially healthy and the boss, Mr Sun, had previously been diligent in repaying debts. He even repaid some of the company's debt out of his own pocket, Chinese media reported. Betty Wang, senior China economist from ANZ Research, said Sunac's default was ""another blow to the fragile property sector"". ""The shock to the market confidence, especially in the private sector segment, was quite big,"" she told the ABC. ""If people regarded Evergrande as an extreme case, it should not be happening to many other developers, especially those with relatively healthy financial performance. ""There are a lot of downside risks in the economy."" While the Hong Kong-listed company has apologised for the default, it said it could miss more deadlines in the coming year. ""Given the group's current liquidity constraints, there is no assurance that the group will be able to meet its financial obligations when due or within the relevant grace periods,"" the company said in a statement. The company also asked the creditors to give it some ""time to overcome challenges"" while it makes efforts towards ""accelerating sales and payment collection, disposing of assets, seeking debt extension, and introducing strategic investors"". Mr Sun is widely known as a ""white knight"" in the Chinese property market, who has been actively acquiring assets from his competitors in the past five years while the property market was cooling. He made it to China's 200-richest list when he was 40. In 2016, at the age of 53, his company became one of the top 10 developers in China through a rapid business expansion. Now Sunac is one of the most indebted Chinese developers, with $US7.7 billion ($11 billion) in US dollar bonds. ""My dream is to build time-honoured and high-quality products that can pass on for generations, and keep Sunac steady, calm and long-lasting,"" Mr Sun said on his company's website. After Beijing implemented the ""three red lines"" scheme — in order to reduce debt within the industry, curb runaway property prices and lift construction standards — a wave of defaults has hit the sector. China's biggest developer, Evergrande, is reeling under more than $400 billion in liabilities. It is a chaotic week for the world's most indebted property developer, with about $2.8 billion seized by banks and shares suspended from trading. Other companies — such as Fantasia and Kaisa — have also defaulted after having struggled for access to finance or refinancing. Since November last year, several policy adjustments at both state and local levels have been introduced in an attempt to salvage the collapsing property sector, while avoiding complete bailouts. Last week, China's central bank, the PBoC, announced that it would lower the mortgage rate for first home buyers for the first time in eight years, by 20 basis points. However, Ms Wang said, Sunac's default shows that the rescue policies have failed to prevent China's real estate sector from declining further. ""Policy adjustments in the past few months do not appear to have been timely enough to improve the financial conditions of developers, and demand is far from recovery,"" she said. ""Uncertainty surrounding lockdowns and their impact on the local economy have dampened the income outlook for households and constrained their purchasing power."" On Friday, the PBoC cut the five-year loan prime rate (LPR), the benchmark for pricing most mortgages, from 4.60 per cent to 4.45 per cent to drive housing demand, while kept the one-year LPR unchanged, at 3.70 per cent. Senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics said the cut was the largest reduction on record, but the lack of any reduction to the one-year LPR suggested that the central bank was trying to keep easing targeted. ""We shouldn’t expect large-scale stimulus of the kind that we saw in 2020,"" he said in a note. ""The PBoC is showing greater restraint in its efforts to support the rest of the economy."" However, the worst may be yet to come, as Chinese developers are facing another peak in offshore bond repayments in June and July. ANZ Research estimates that $US14.3 billion ($20.3 billion) of offshore bond debt, or 25 per cent of this year's annual amount, will be due in the next two months. Sluggish home sales — which have been hit by strict COVID-19 lockdowns in parts of the country — have worsened the situation. Once a symbol of glittering success, China's biggest property group is tanking, dragging many of its competitors with it, writes Ian Verrender. The top-30 listed developers in China reported an 11.1 per cent, year-on-year contraction in their collective cash position as at the end of 2021 and, since January, sales have dropped 32.2 per cent, year-on-year, according to ANZ Research. Contractual home sales from China's top-100 developers halved in April, meaning the estimated monthly operating income of $US5.7 billion ($8.1 billion) will not be enough to cover debt payments. China's property sector contributes more than 20 per cent of China's economic output by some metrics, and Ms Wang said dampening across the whole sector would increase uncertainty for China's growth outlook. ""A fiscal push and the infrastructure drive have picked up and may go some way to filling the gap if the property sector retreats, "" she said. ""This would come at the cost of more leveraging and front-loading of China's growth potential. ""We expect China's potential growth to drop to the low end of the 4-5 per cent range in the next few years, much earlier than many others expect."" NAB also has downgraded China's GDP growth prospects, expecting China’s economy to grow by 4.2 per cent in 2022, down from 5 per cent forecast previously. As Beijing has indicated that it would not bail out private developers, many firms are betting on a rebound in the sector sooner rather than later. ""The fall of another top developer is likely to accelerate the process of industry revaluation, putting the sector's future at risk,"" Ms Wang said. ""The market capitalisation of some of the top-30 listed real estate companies has shrunk as much as 80 per cent since the first half of 2021. ""We remain cautious about the near-term outlook for private developers.""

8,'Business as usual': Home builder Metricon denies it is in danger of collapse,business,"  Metricon meets with Victorian government amid insolvency rumours Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australia's largest home builder, Metricon, has been forced to deny reports it is in financial difficulty after the unexpected death of its founder just days ago. Metricon chief executive and founder Mario Biasin died on Monday, and general manager Peter Langfelder was appointed acting chief executive. Metricon has been hit by rising building costs, supply constraints and soaring subcontractor fees, but the company strongly denied it is on the brink of collapse and said it has no solvency problem. Mr Langfelder said it was ""business as usual"" for Metricon, and all staff and suppliers had been paid ""on time, in full"". ""There's no truth to the rumours, we're in a really strong, viable position, we've got the support of our banks, we've got headroom available,"" he said. ""There are challenges, there are labour shortages, there are some delays, and customers need to be patient with all builders, the industry's going through a pretty tough time as many industries are."" Metricon executives met with Victorian government representatives on Thursday morning. The government is one of Metricon's biggest clients. Treasurer Tim Pallas said the company told his government ""all its trade creditors have been paid in full and on time and Metricon expects this to continue"". ""We understand the pressure on builders on the eastern seaboard due to increases in costs, and the impacts this is having on the construction industry and residential clients,"" he said. ""The government will continue to work constructively with the industry to help address these challenges. ""Metricon is one of several partners in our Big Housing Build delivering high-quality social and affordable homes across the state, and this unprecedented program of work is on track."" Mr Pallas said the company informed the government it was ""working constructively with its lender"". He also acknowledged Mr Biasin's death. ""I was shocked and saddened to learn of Mario Biasin's passing,"" Mr Pallas said. ""On behalf of the government, I extend my condolences to his family and his Metricon colleagues and acknowledge his significant contribution to the construction industry and the state."" Master Builders Victoria's Michaela Lihou said her organisation was optimistic about Metricon's future, but there were issues facing the entire industry. ""The reality of the situation that the whole industry is experiencing at the moment is there's supply shortages, there's skill shortages, there's price increases,"" she told ABC News Breakfast. ""We've got businesses that are walking away from the industry. We've got insolvencies going on. We're trying our best to protect the industry."" Metricon employs around 2,500 staff and has around 4,000 homes under construction. Federal Labor met with building industry representatives this morning to discuss the issues facing Metricon. ""What's getting worse, what's really biting for companies like Metricon and others at the moment, is the area of skill shortages,"" Shadow Housing Minister Jason Clare said. ""Whether it is skilled workers on site or whether it is labourers, this is something that everyone I speak to in this sector is worried about."" The construction sector has been hit by insolvencies due to rising costs associated with global supply constraints. Iconic firm Grocon collapsed in 2020 and this year mega-builder ProBuild — with its $5 billion pipeline of work — fell over. Since then, ABD Group, Privium Home, Condev and, most recently, Next, went under. Equifax data suggests, while the overall rate of insolvencies in March 2022 was up 5 per cent on last year, construction insolvencies were 28 per cent higher. In the first quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2021, 270 construction companies filed for insolvency a 21 per cent jump.

9,Ziggy the bag man's mission to access his money and help other vulnerable people,business,"  Ziggy the Brisbane bag man's mission to access his money in the bank puts spotlight on homeless struggle Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Zbygnew Wilczek has lived in parks around Brisbane's western suburbs for years, among dozens of plastic bags, cardboard boxes and umbrellas. Better known as Ziggy the bag man, the grey-haired character is well-known around the city and usually likes to keep to himself. But recently his friends got in touch with ABC Radio Brisbane's Rebecca Levingston — Ziggy needed help. Specifically, he needed help accessing money he held in a NAB account. ""I've got over $20,000 but I can't get to it to pay anybody. I can't get to it to get one of those card things,"" he said, before telling Levingston he hadn't visited a bank for at least eight years. ""The National Bank, they're making it so hard and they're also making me look a real pig-type person, a monster who just uses people and wants to rob them. And I'm not made that way. ""The manager said that their way of doing things is they can't come out here. ""I even got [an] officer of the law to go to them and they told her that they can't even give her money, that they don't know it's me. I'm world famous and yet my bank doesn't know who I am? ""They probably drive by here every now and then and they still don't know who I am."" Ziggy said a NAB employee told him to visit a branch to get the necessary paperwork sorted so he could withdraw money, however the elderly man preferred to stay away, saying he would not go in ""a suit and tie"". ""I'll go in with 20 bags. I'll come in with half of my world, how's that going to look?"" he said. ""Just come out here with the papers, so I can sign [them], so everything can start coming out and [we don't] have to touch because of the corona [virus]. I'm very scared of that. ""I'm close to 70 and I don't want to drop dead yet. I've got lots of life still."" Levingston took Ziggy's story to the bank, and NAB retail executive general manager Krissie Jones said it was ""very important"" customers could access banking services. ""Sandra from our team went to see Ziggy and they've been able to determine a solution that's going to work for him ongoing,"" she said. ""We want to make sure he has a tailored solution. ""He was really pleased he was able to have an option each time he needs access to his money."" Ziggy was not just concerned at his own situation, he was worried other vulnerable people might also struggle to access essential services. Ms Jones said the pandemic had definitely revealed that sometimes ""not everyone wants to go into a branch to get their money or [they] aren't able to"". She said NAB offered ATMs and services at Australia Post for deposits and withdrawals and computer-savvy customers could use internet banking or the NAB app. ""However in some cases, and you can imagine, refugees coming into the country from Ukraine, for example, or customers who might be fleeing from domestic violence or even in natural disasters, that sometimes it's really tricky and not everyone has the right, conventional forms of ID on them,"" Ms Jones said. ""So we do have some alternative options in those scenarios. ""We have a customer service hub which really supports customers in this different and unique situations, to make sure we can identify them because we want to make sure we're keeping people's money secure but once they're identified, to provide them with access to their money."" Accessing welfare, banking and other services was often overwhelming for those on the streets or without strong supports, said Rees Maddren, service manager for Anglicare Southern Queensland's INSYNC Youth Services. He said Centrelink and bank staff were often complying with their organisation's rules and could not help. ""Now, especially, Centrelink has social workers, who once they know someone is homelessness, they start going above and beyond what they usually do,"" Mr Maddren said. ""If they come to an organisation like us, we start negotiating identification, we have to support them to get documents, to get birth certificate reissued, to open a bank account. ""It's hard to navigate if you don't have people in the system helping you. ""If I had a wishlist for banks or others, it would be if you find out people are homeless, make some concessions and have some understanding. ""Put them in touch with someone who can help navigate the system.""

10,How an 'outdated association with criminality' is leaving tattoo studios facing closure,business,"  Insurance premiums for tattoo shops leaving businesses facing the prospect of closure Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For the past eight years, a tattoo studio has occupied 205 Brisbane Street in Ipswich, but that's about to change. Family-owned business Compass Tattoo will shut its doors in six months' time, with nowhere to go. A recent change in their landlord's insurance has forced their eviction, creating a frightening ultimatum: pay $30,000 a year — on top of their normal expenses — to keep their prime spot or get out. ""Our landlord has come to us and said the only way they can renew our lease is if we take on a pretty substantial landlord insurance bill,"" co-owner of the studio Angela Nayler said. ""His insurance every year is around $11,000 for the building. This year, if he keeps Compass Tattoo as a tenant, he's looking at around $41,000."" The mother of three said it's a bill the business simply cannot afford. ""He wants to keep us on. He's tried over 20 insurance companies and they all say the same thing — they won't insure him if there's a tattoo store in the building, because we're classed as high risk,"" she said. ""There are only a few [insurers] in Australia who will cover us, and they're able to push up prices as much as they like."" Ms Nayler said she had contacted over a dozen other insurers in a desperate search for an explanation for why tattoo studios were classed as high risk. She said a broker at Shield Insurance told her many insurers would not cover tattoo parlours ""due to gang affiliation and all of those sorts of things"". In a statement, Shield Insurance said ""insurers generally relay broad feedback such as it being outside of their underwriting scope, due to the high risk of the activity."" ""Gallagher Insurance has a facility for tattoo artists and to my knowledge this is the only option in-market."" Arthur J Gallagher insurance has been contacted for comment. An Insurance Council of Australia spokesman said capital is harder to come by so insurers' risk appetites are lower. ""Each insurer bases the offering of a premium on their claims experience,"" a spokesman said. ""An increase in claims activity in a segment can lead to an increase in premiums for that segment, or the insurer choosing not to offer insurance to that segment at all."" Matthew Sullivan from Eternal Mark Tattoo in Gympie said he had been made to feel like a criminal, despite having never been behind bars or committing a crime. ""I don't feel like I fall under the category of [an artist] or anything like that,"" he said. ""I'm basically put in the category of outlaw motorcycle member even though I'm not."" His rent has doubled this year after his landlord copped an insurance price hike of $16,000 because he had a tattooist as a tenant. ""We've gone from having an insurance premium of $4,000 to like over $20,000,"" he said. ""I have to pass the extra cost to the customer."" He said he feared the extra cost on top of his other expenses could put him out of business. ""Some days I feel like shutting the doors because I'm copping all these extra payments and I'm just like what's the worth?"" Mr Sullivan said. ""Something's got to change otherwise we're going to see a lot more small businesses shut down."" Australian Tattooist Guild president Alex Cairns said it was a ""common"" issue nationwide. ""Almost every tattoo shop owner that I've spoken to in the last two years has the same problem,"" he said. He said the industry had moved beyond its dark past with organised crime. ""I think there's an outdated association with an element of criminality,"" he said. ""That's a couple of decades out of date."" In order for tattooists to be licensed, they have to undergo strict background checks, including fingerprinting in both Queensland and New South Wales. ""You'd be pretty hard pressed to find examples where there was [links to organised crime]."" Red Hill building owner Samantha Morrison made the decision to evict her ""loyal"" tattooist tenant after she received an updated building insurance bill for an additional $10,000. ""We're losing the best tenant that we've ever had,"" she said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Ms Morrison said when she questioned the price hike with her insurance company she was told it was because of the tattoo parlour. ""[They] mentioned Molotov cocktails, bombings,"" she said. ""It's unfair, it's discriminatory. ""Our tenant has no affiliates whatsoever — not even a parking ticket in his criminal history. ""I don't think this is beneficial for anyone except the people who are getting paid big commissions and throwing these bogus charges on poor little mum-and-dad businesses.""

11,"Here's where things went right for Labor, and very wrong for the Liberals, on election night",business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Australian people have spoken, and the next prime minister of Australia will be Anthony Albanese. So how did it all unfold? At the moment we don't know whether Labor will govern with a majority, or with the aid of some of the independents or Greens who'll be sitting on the crossbenches. But what we do know is this is a devastating loss for the Coalition after almost a decade in power. [ Live results: Keep an eye on the latest totals, updated as the count rolls on. ] Let's have a look at the electorate map. (You might notice it looks a little unusual, but that's for good reason. Here's why.) Each of these little hexagons is a seat, filled with 105,000 or so voters, and to form government the aim is to win a majority — at least 76 seats out of 151 total. The Coalition went into the election holding exactly 76. By Sunday morning, it was slashed to just 50 certain seats, and ahead in another six. That would still leave it short of the 65 it held when Kevin Rudd led Labor to a crushing victory in 2007. But this hasn't been a landslide like Kevin07, instead it's something more interesting — and perhaps more tectonic for the future of Australian politics. A lot of the seats the Coalition lost were on big margins, had never been lost, and were held by senior Liberals. And they didn't all fall to Labor, instead going to independents, known as the ""teal wave"", and in at least one seat to the Greens. The newly victorious independents campaigned heavily on climate change and political integrity — and all of them are women. For decades the Coalition has sowed division on climate change as a means to win government, but at this election climate campaigners have been instrumental in its defeat. While these independents have mostly seized Liberal seats, they've also done so at the cost of Labor's primary vote, as traditional Labor voters chose to strategically support the independents. Coming into the election, there were six MPs outside of Labor and the Coalition. It is now looking entirely possible that in the next Parliament there could be as many as 16. On Sydney’s northern beaches, independents Kylea Tink and Sophie Scamps have seized the seats of North Sydney and Mackellar off the Liberal Party, ejecting Trent Zimmerman and Jason Falinski. Allegra Spender has also toppled Dave Sharma in Wentworth, returning the once-safe Liberal seat into independent hands. Further west, Dai Le captured the seat of Fowler, but off the ALP, after Labor tried to inject an outsider in Kristina Keneally into the seat. They'll all join sitting independent MP Zali Steggall, who has retained Warringah with an increased margin over controversial Liberal Katherine Deves. In Victoria, Monique Ryan is ahead of Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong, where the man often touted as the next Liberal leader all but conceded it would be impossible for him to win. And former ABC journalist Zoe Daniel took Goldstein from Tim Wilson after a bruising campaign. Helen Haines retains the independent stronghold of Indi, which she took over from Cathy McGowan in 2019, while the Greens' Adam Bandt also retained Melbourne. In Brisbane, without any high-profile ""teal"" candidates, the Greens have shot up and surprised the major parties, as voters went to the polls just three months after major flooding hit the city for the second time in 11 years. Greens challenger Elizabeth Watson-Brown snatched the suburban seat of Ryan off the LNP, and her colleague Stephen Bates is within reach of taking another seat off the LNP's Queensland pile, the inner-city division of Brisbane. (Worth noting: we're showing seats which are too close to call, but where one candidate is ahead, with a little coloured outline.) The Greens also look to have turfed Labor from another inner-Brisbane stronghold: Kevin Rudd's old seat of Griffith. Elsewhere in Queensland, Bob Katter held Kennedy for the 10th-straight election. The teal wave stretched beyond the eastern states. In Western Australia, independent Kate Chaney looks likely to unseat the Liberals' Celia Hammond in Curtin. More on that later. In Tasmania, independent Andrew Wilkie has retained Clark while in South Australia the Centre Alliance's Rebekha Sharkie held Mayo. So where did that leave Labor? Coming into the 2022 election, Labor had to increase its total number of seats by seven in order to govern in its own right. Losing Fowler, despite a 14 per cent margin, and likely Griffith in Brisbane, left the ALP needing to pick up nine seats elsewhere to form a majority. This was no easy task on a night when the teals and Greens were picking up seats all over the country. The Liberals — facing likely losses in WA and Qld — pinned their hopes on New South Wales. But a chaotic preselection process in many seats, and a divisive but ultimately unsuccessful candidate in Warringah, were too much to overcome. Not only did the Liberals not gain any seats from Labor in NSW, they actually lost two. Voters in the outer Sydney seat of Robertson kept their bellwether status by giving the seat to Labor with a swing of nearly 9 per cent. And in western Sydney, Labor's Sally Sitou took Reid with a swing of more than 8 per cent. The gains continued further south. In a sign that the Liberals had lost touch with their base, Labor took a seat off them in Victoria for the first time in decades. Not once, but twice. Higgins — former treasurer Peter Costello's old seat in Melbourne's inner south-east — turned red, as did the seat of Chisholm with a 6.8 per cent swing. Rounding out the biggest states was Queensland, where Labor is still in with a shot in Brisbane. A win there would offset its loss in Griffith, leaving the sunshine state just as red, but significantly more green. In the territories, Labor also looks likely to continue its hold, but the seat of Lingiari where Marion Scrymgour is hoping to take over from veteran MP Warren Snowdon is too close to call. Away from the big three states, the unusual trends of the night continued as Tasmania, which was talked about as possibly delivering seats to Labor, went its own way. Liberal Bridget Archer looks like she'll hold Bass, after standing up to her party on key issues. But it's still too close to call in the Tasmanian seat of Lyons, where Brian Mitchell is barely ahead after a swing of nearly 5 per cent. But further west, Labor's fortunes picked up. The ALP won Boothby in South Australia, and is ahead in Sturt. By the time polls closed in Western Australia, it was clear the Coalition couldn't form government, and Labor's hopes for a majority rested on a big swing from voters out West. Boy did they deliver. Hasluck, Swan, Pearce and Tangney all swept to Labor thanks to a statewide swing of nearly 11 per cent against the Coalition, much larger than on the east coast. And the final nail in the coffin for the Coalition was a real kicker. The seat of Curtin, once held by deputy leader Julie Bishop, has been in Liberal hands since its inception in 1949, apart from one three-year term. On a night when Australian voters made it clear they're prepared to throw out the status quo when they feel the major parties aren't listening to them, Curtin looks likely to send independent MP Kate Chaney to Canberra. So where does this leave us? Let's clear the map and lay out where things stand. Labor has 72 seats, four short of a majority, but is the only viable option to form a government. That leaves us with 15 seats in doubt, according to the ABC election computer. If Labor can hold onto the seats of Lingiari and Lyons, where it currently leads, then it will need just two more from the remaining 13 to govern in its own right. While Labor is currently ahead in enough seats to form a majority, there is no guarantee these leads will hold as more votes are counted. While the election may not deliver a clear majority for Labor, when you look at the issues that motivated candidates, you have a large parliamentary majority united in their desire for stronger action on climate change, and establishing a corruption watchdog. Former prime minister Paul Keating famously said, if you change the government you change the country, and Saturday was no different. Here's how Australia started the day.

12,Winegrape growers worried for future as forecast shows 'disastrous' next season outlook,business," ABC Rural Growers may dump more grapes next season as wine glut grim forecast continues Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Winegrape growers are calling for government assistance with an oversupply of grapes that is sinking prices and leaving fruit unsold. The crisis in the global freight sector, along with China's decision to impose massive anti-dumping tariffs just as Australian growers produced a large crop in 2021 are behind the glut. The latest Wine Australia figures show exports were down 26 per cent year-on-year. This has been coupled with rising input costs, which have at least doubled in the past year due to increased disease-pressure and the cost of chemical, fertiliser, fuel and labour. Industry body Australian Grape and Wine said it expected difficult commercial conditions for the next three to five years. ""It’s a tough message to deliver, but we can’t afford to stick our heads in the sand,"" Australian Grape and Wine chief executive Tony Battaglene said. The situation is especially dire in South Australia's Riverland, where 80 per cent of the wine produced is exported. Riverland wine executive officer Lyndall Rowe said while interest from south-east Asian markets had been promising, it could not absorb the supply in the short term. ""It’s still positive because it’s a foundation step … but it will take time to grow.” Ms Rowe said the drop in demand had led many wineries to seek outside storage and build additional tanks. While the region finished harvesting grapes in early May, Riverland's CCW Co-operative chief executive Jim Godden said storage at most wineries was full by March. ""This meant the pace of vintage had to slow down into the swing of when space became available,"" he said. Mr Godden said he did not know how many members were out of contract but had received numerous calls from people trying to find a home for their grapes. The Riverland is home to more than 900 growers but some are choosing to get out of the game. Real estate agent Sam Hayes from Toop Toop Rural said a number of vineyards in the region have been listed recently. ""I think we'll see a generational shift in ownership of vineyards,"" he said. Mr Hayes said while the initial interest was from local buyers, the value for money could attract wider investment. “What is currently a liability could be an asset again very soon.” Recently, Australia's largest family-owned winery, Casella Family Brands, put 35 of their vineyards up for sale across New South Wales and South Australia. Colliers is handling the sale and national director of agribusiness Tim Altschwager said the offering was not related to the current oversupply issues. ""It's contrary to that. Casella is well known for selling into the US market. They've had a record sales year and haven't been affected by that overall,"" Mr Altschwager. In the Riverina, there are growing concerns that wineries could cap grape deliveries for next year, which could see the price of red grape varieties drop even further. Riverina Winegrape Growers president Jeremy Cass said the outlook for next season was ""disastrous"". ""The forecast coming from some of the wineries early, seems to be that they're full,"" Mr Cass said. Fourth-generation Griffith winegrape grower James Cremasco described the current situation as a losing battle, but said they would keep going, as the family always had. ""There is a lot of hardship, and there's generational farmers. I've got mates my own age, they're all talking about 'what are we doing this for?',"" Mr Cremasco said. ""The family's been doing it for so many years and I'd hate to see it go backwards, but at the end of the day dollars do count."" In the Murray Valley it is estimated that 20,000 tonnes of fruit were left unsold this season. Murray Valley Winegrowers executive officer Paul Derrico said anyone who had red grapes that were uncontracted had found it very difficult. ""They're really at the crossroads now as to whether they are going to continue on, and they are looking for any kind of financial assistance they can,"" he said. The grapes that haven't been sold to a winery still need to be harvested, otherwise it can have an impact on the vine and crop for the coming year. ""If we could get some form of assistance … given the heartbreak that growers have gone through over the past few months of not being able to sell their fruit,"" Mr Derrico said. A spokesperson for the Victorian agriculture minister acknowledged winegrape growers were being impacted by global demand and supply chain challenges as a result of the pandemic. ""We are working closely with growers and industry groups to support them to manage these impacts,"" the spokesperson said. Mr Derrico said his organisation had also requested support from the NSW government. ""At this stage it seems that the NSW government would probably not provide a direct financial assistance to help growers harvest their fruit, instead referring growers to the rural small business grants and rural assistance loans.” We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

13,These cattle farmers worry they're in the firing line of the race to renewables,business,"  NT farmers worried about the race to renewables and lithium exploration in the Top End Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Shannon and Daniel Tapp bought Spooks Hill station bordering Litchfield National Park near Darwin last year, hoping to get away from mining. Cattle station owners fear environmental impacts from lithium project in the Top End Miner Ragusa Minerals is promising to uphold the highest environmental standards An investigation is underway into allegations of pollution caused by another company at Finniss Lithium Mine ""We have a permanent beautiful spring that flows out of the hills here all year round, we have undulating ridge country, sand, and low lying flats, its just beautiful,"" Ms Tapp said. They sold their property in the gas-rich Beetaloo Basin because it had been targeted for mining exploration. So the couple was dismayed to have discovered through a newspaper advert that a Perth-based miner, Ragusa Minerals, has applied to explore for lithium on their new property. ""I thought we were going to be nestled in here on freehold land between another cattle station and the national park and that there was no way industry was going to turn up,"" Ms Tapp said. ""I'm just concerned about them coming to make their money and leaving, and leaving me with a mess."" Lithium is a critical mineral that is found in batteries, and is particularly favoured by electric vehicle manufacturers because it is lightweight. Australia's miners are hot property as global demand for electric vehicles soars. Australia is home to some of the biggest known lithium deposits in the world. However, the push to extract the valuable resource has raised concerns for some Northern Territory pastoralists, including Shannon and Daniel Tapp, about what it would mean for the environment, and their livelihoods. While the gas industry is required to negotiate land access agreements with pastoralists in the Northern Territory to explore, minerals miners are not. Mr Tapp claims that for a relatively small property like theirs, mining impacts could be large. ""These aren't small impacts we're looking at, where potentially a third of our property could be basically under a mine pit,"" he said. ""It's going to disrupt our business."" The lithium exploration application also covers part of neighbouring Hazard Station, which has been in Ms Tapp's family since the 1960s and is now owned by her sister, Casey Townsend. Their father is buried there. ""I'm just gutted, because we've operated for so long without disturbance, if it goes ahead it is just going to disrupt our whole business,"" Ms Townsend said. ""Just coming onto the property with trucks, if gates are left open, it disrupts our breeding program."" The families are particularly concerned about whether mining runoff could pollute the creek, which runs through both stations. ""Because that's my creek where I have to drink from, we've got no other water here,"" Ms Tapp said. ""And if they say they can contain that, in our wet seasons when we sometimes have ten inches of rain, I don't see how they can do that on this country."" The family wanted to see what a lithium mine looked like, so they went to the new Core Lithium Finniss mine nearby in March. They said their concerns increased after discovering what they claim was runoff from the site, which they allege appeared to have reached a creek. The Environment Protection Agency told the ABC that the NT Environment Department is investigating. Core Lithium told the ABC that after receiving complaints in March and April, as the dry season started it carried out water testing which found that the site was not discharging sediment at levels that breached its licence. A new NT mine, Core Lithium, signs a major supply agreement with Tesla. Ragusa Minerals Chairman Jerko Zuvela is hoping to reassure landowners that his company's planned Litchfield Lithium Project will adhere to the highest environmental standards. ""It borders a national park so we've got an extra level of caution and concern,"" he said. ""The tenements, if they are granted, come with a lot of environmental conditions and requirements and obviously we would be following all those."" Mr Zuvela said the company is keen to foster good community relationships. ""We always work closely with the pastoralists to make sure that there's no lasting impacts, or minimal impacts, for the works that you are doing, and make sure that their concerns are mitigated,"" he said. ""If that we means modifying exploration practices that is something we can consider. We want to get their approval and consent to do what we're looking to do."" Mr Zuvela said the company has a track record of working with farmers in Western Australia. ""For our Burracoppin Halloysite Project in Western Australia in the wheat sheep belt we were required to get the pastoralists' consent to enter the land and get the mineral rights so we worked with them to get their permission,"" he said. Daniel Tapp is not reassured. ""What we've seen is iron ore mines being approved and then causing damage in the Roper, there is no accountability, and the regulators are basically non existent,"" he said. Mr Tapp said he knows that because the world needs to change over to using renewable energy, more of the metal needed to make batteries and other equipment must be found, and that he could be accused of just not wanting it ""in his own back yard"". ""The industry needs to select areas that are sustainable,"" he said. ""This area here and the area where the Core Lithium Mine is is all swamp and spring country, that's no place for mines, it's just going to leach out into waterways."" ""And we need an overall picture of what this industry will be like when it's fully developed, so we can give informed consent."" The NT Environment Centre's Director, Kirsty Howey, said recent pollution by several NT mines suggests the Government is ill prepared to regulate more. ""At the moment we see that there's over five hundred square kilometres of lithium tenements covering an area which is renowned globally for its beautiful pristine nature,"" she said. Lithium battery developer 3ME is helping big miners switch to electric. ""And the concern is that mining regulation in the Northern Territory is an absolute basket case."" The NT Mines Department has not yet responded to a request for its response. Ms Howey said she realises that more lithium mines will be needed. ""There is no doubt we need to be moving towards renewables from fossil fuel extraction, but we need to make sure that in the move to this mining, that we ensure that these companies and regulators comply with the highest possible environmental standards,"" she said. Ragusa Minerals said it hopes to start exploration drilling within six months, and if it is able to verify that the Litchfield lithium resource is worth mining it hopes to develop a mine within five to seven years. Shannon Tapp said her family is determined to stay put. ""This isn't just an industry to me, it's a life that I am passionate about, and you want to defend it,"" she said.

Cattle station owners fear environmental impacts from lithium project in the Top End Miner Ragusa Minerals is promising to uphold the highest environmental standards An investigation is underway into allegations of pollution caused by another company at Finniss Lithium Mine ""We have a permanent beautiful spring that flows out of the hills here all year round, we have undulating ridge country, sand, and low lying flats, its just beautiful,"" Ms Tapp said. They sold their property in the gas-rich Beetaloo Basin because it had been targeted for mining exploration. So the couple was dismayed to have discovered through a newspaper advert that a Perth-based miner, Ragusa Minerals, has applied to explore for lithium on their new property. ""I thought we were going to be nestled in here on freehold land between another cattle station and the national park and that there was no way industry was going to turn up,"" Ms Tapp said. ""I'm just concerned about them coming to make their money and leaving, and leaving me with a mess."" Lithium is a critical mineral that is found in batteries, and is particularly favoured by electric vehicle manufacturers because it is lightweight. Australia's miners are hot property as global demand for electric vehicles soars. Australia is home to some of the biggest known lithium deposits in the world. However, the push to extract the valuable resource has raised concerns for some Northern Territory pastoralists, including Shannon and Daniel Tapp, about what it would mean for the environment, and their livelihoods. While the gas industry is required to negotiate land access agreements with pastoralists in the Northern Territory to explore, minerals miners are not. Mr Tapp claims that for a relatively small property like theirs, mining impacts could be large. ""These aren't small impacts we're looking at, where potentially a third of our property could be basically under a mine pit,"" he said. ""It's going to disrupt our business."" The lithium exploration application also covers part of neighbouring Hazard Station, which has been in Ms Tapp's family since the 1960s and is now owned by her sister, Casey Townsend. Their father is buried there. ""I'm just gutted, because we've operated for so long without disturbance, if it goes ahead it is just going to disrupt our whole business,"" Ms Townsend said. ""Just coming onto the property with trucks, if gates are left open, it disrupts our breeding program."" The families are particularly concerned about whether mining runoff could pollute the creek, which runs through both stations. ""Because that's my creek where I have to drink from, we've got no other water here,"" Ms Tapp said. ""And if they say they can contain that, in our wet seasons when we sometimes have ten inches of rain, I don't see how they can do that on this country."" The family wanted to see what a lithium mine looked like, so they went to the new Core Lithium Finniss mine nearby in March. They said their concerns increased after discovering what they claim was runoff from the site, which they allege appeared to have reached a creek. The Environment Protection Agency told the ABC that the NT Environment Department is investigating. Core Lithium told the ABC that after receiving complaints in March and April, as the dry season started it carried out water testing which found that the site was not discharging sediment at levels that breached its licence. A new NT mine, Core Lithium, signs a major supply agreement with Tesla. Ragusa Minerals Chairman Jerko Zuvela is hoping to reassure landowners that his company's planned Litchfield Lithium Project will adhere to the highest environmental standards. ""It borders a national park so we've got an extra level of caution and concern,"" he said. ""The tenements, if they are granted, come with a lot of environmental conditions and requirements and obviously we would be following all those."" Mr Zuvela said the company is keen to foster good community relationships. ""We always work closely with the pastoralists to make sure that there's no lasting impacts, or minimal impacts, for the works that you are doing, and make sure that their concerns are mitigated,"" he said. ""If that we means modifying exploration practices that is something we can consider. We want to get their approval and consent to do what we're looking to do."" Mr Zuvela said the company has a track record of working with farmers in Western Australia. ""For our Burracoppin Halloysite Project in Western Australia in the wheat sheep belt we were required to get the pastoralists' consent to enter the land and get the mineral rights so we worked with them to get their permission,"" he said. Daniel Tapp is not reassured. ""What we've seen is iron ore mines being approved and then causing damage in the Roper, there is no accountability, and the regulators are basically non existent,"" he said. Mr Tapp said he knows that because the world needs to change over to using renewable energy, more of the metal needed to make batteries and other equipment must be found, and that he could be accused of just not wanting it ""in his own back yard"". ""The industry needs to select areas that are sustainable,"" he said. ""This area here and the area where the Core Lithium Mine is is all swamp and spring country, that's no place for mines, it's just going to leach out into waterways."" ""And we need an overall picture of what this industry will be like when it's fully developed, so we can give informed consent."" The NT Environment Centre's Director, Kirsty Howey, said recent pollution by several NT mines suggests the Government is ill prepared to regulate more. ""At the moment we see that there's over five hundred square kilometres of lithium tenements covering an area which is renowned globally for its beautiful pristine nature,"" she said. Lithium battery developer 3ME is helping big miners switch to electric. ""And the concern is that mining regulation in the Northern Territory is an absolute basket case."" The NT Mines Department has not yet responded to a request for its response. Ms Howey said she realises that more lithium mines will be needed. ""There is no doubt we need to be moving towards renewables from fossil fuel extraction, but we need to make sure that in the move to this mining, that we ensure that these companies and regulators comply with the highest possible environmental standards,"" she said. Ragusa Minerals said it hopes to start exploration drilling within six months, and if it is able to verify that the Litchfield lithium resource is worth mining it hopes to develop a mine within five to seven years. Shannon Tapp said her family is determined to stay put. ""This isn't just an industry to me, it's a life that I am passionate about, and you want to defend it,"" she said.

15,Melbourne's late-night liquor licence freeze creates division as new venues hit the 1am wall,business,"  As Melbourne's night-life recovers from COVID, a liquor licence freeze brought in 13 years ago is under the microscope Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog After sitting derelict for about a decade, Jobs Warehouse in Bourke Street is being transformed into a hospitality location. The venue's operator, O'Brien Group, is spending $50 million to turn the building into what it calls a ""high-end"" mix of restaurants and bars. ""This isn't a King St venue,"" O'Brien Group chief executive Michael O'Brien said. The O'Brien Group had applied for a late-night liquor licence to trade until 3am, but was only granted a licence until 1am. In 2008, the state government brought in a freeze on the granting of new liquor licences in inner-city areas, to try to reduce violence after a spate of incidents. The government granted the O'Brien Group an exemption to apply to the regulator for an extra 2 hours of late-night trading, stating that the premises were of ""major cultural importance to the state"". But that exemption failed to sway the City of Melbourne and the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission. The O'Brien Group took its application to VCAT after being rejected by the commission but after a long and protracted fight, it eventually lost. Mr O'Brien is calling for a relaxing of licensing laws and believes a re-think is needed to bring the city back to life after the pandemic. ""I think the one o'clock moratorium should be on a case-by-case basis because the truth is some venues shouldn't trade past 1am, some venues should probably just be shut down completely,"" he said. ""When international people come here, and more and more will come, they will expect a good late-night offering."" City of Melbourne Lord Mayor Sally Capp attended a recent photo shoot at the Job Warehouse site, posing with Mr O'Brien. Despite that show of support, she will not confirm if she also agrees with Mr O'Brien's push. ""I've supported the 11am to 1am [trading hours] and that's the permit and approval that was given,"" Ms Capp said. ""I think at the end of the day it's part of the normal push and shove for everybody to try to get the best outcome they can."" Some CBD residents argue the pause on granting new late-night licences needs to remain, claiming rowdy behaviour will stop people from moving to the city. Dr Stan Capp has lived in Melbourne's CBD for over two decades and is president of residents' association EastEnders. ""You come to the city. Therefore, you're going to have more noise, more sort of stuff. Well, that's fine. And we know that, and we live in closer proximity to other things,"" Dr Capp said. ""But I don't think getting awakened at two o'clock or three o'clock in the morning as a regular event 365 days a year, is going to be conducive to having people stay. People aren't going to like that."" Dr Capp said he was opposed to fuelling the revitalisation of the CBD with alcohol-related business. ""Of course, I want to do it for more business and all the rest of it. But if you're so adjacent to residents, where they actually live, then I just think it's anathema. We should not be doing that."" It has been five years since Jon Walker's son Jaiden was killed in a one-punch assault in Melbourne's CBD. It still impacts his family every day. ""People say that time, things heal with time and it just doesn't, it just doesn't at all,"" Mr Walker said. ""It's bad enough losing a child in the first place. But when you throw into it, the court side of things and having to deal with the offender, police, detectives, it's not good."" He's now part of a campaign led by boxer Danny Green to raise awareness about coward punch attacks. Mr Walker said simply banning late-night liquor licences isn't the answer. ""Looking at some other coward punch events, the only one common denominator that I've seen is the background of the offender,"" he said. ""It's typically a violent person. They're a thug and that's not going to change whether they have two beers or 10 beers. The DNA is already there, that's not going to change that situation."" Mr Walker said shorter opening hours could lead to more incidents of binge drinking and alcohol abuse. ""You'll probably just cram down as many drinks as you possibly can in a shorter period of time, which is actually more harmful than actually drinking over a longer period of time,"" he said. After years of researching alcohol policy and violence, Dr Claire Wilkinson is in favour of the pause on new licences remaining. A senior research fellow at UNSW, Dr Wilkinson said overseas research and data show the need for a delicate balance between people enjoying themselves and reducing violence. ""I think they're a good approach. Other cities have put blanket bans on licences where you can't get a new liquor licence at all. So, it's not as harsh as that,"" she said. ""While we may be focused on economy-building and growing the night-time economy, we need to recognise that alcohol is associated with a range of harms."" There are currently exemptions to the freeze for some smaller venues and live music locations. The state government says the pause will remain in place until June 2023, insisting it is balancing the need for a ""strong and vibrant night-time economy while continuing to combat alcohol-related harm"".

16,Petrol prices are again above $2 a litre. Here's why motoring groups are pleading for more help,business,"  Hip pocket pain at the bowser as fuel above $2 a litre prompts pleas for help from motoring groups Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian motorists are again paying eye-watering levels for fuel amid a global supply crunch caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine that has swamped efforts to shield consumers from the hip-pocket pain. Prices at the bowser across Australia's capital cities are at or above $2 a litre, and higher in regional areas, sparking warnings that trucking businesses could be pushed to tipping point unless help is provided by the new Labor government. Alex Forrest from Western Australia's motoring advocacy group RAC said Russia's war in Ukraine was negatively affecting global oil supplies, while the falling value of the Australian dollar was making matters worse. Warren Clark, the chief executive of the National Road Transport Association, said the spiralling price of diesel was ""devastating"" his members, who had little to no capacity to pass on the rising costs. Under a decision by the Morrison government, the fuel excise paid by motorists was cut by half to 22 cents a litre for six months until September. It follows concerns about the effects of soaring fuel prices on the economy. Mr Clark said that although trucking businesses benefitted from the reduction, a decision to scrap a fuel tax credit at the same time had offset most of the gains. As a consequence, he said freight operators were only 4.6 cents a litre better off under the changes — an amount he described as ""absolutely nothing"" compared with the often wild movements in fuel prices. ""Without exaggerating, it's having a devastating effect on our guys,"" Mr Clark said. ""If we can't get the price of fuel down, or we can't keep the fuel excise where it is, then I would say there would be many, many people that won't be able to continue in business. ""They just can't absorb the cost."" According to Mr Clark, between 20 and 30 per cent of trucking businesses were at risk of hitting the wall as the squeeze intensified. He blamed Australia's loss of refining capacity — and its subsequent increased dependence on fuel imports — for the predicament. And he said consumers should brace for the fallout, warning that higher costs at the check-out and shortages on shelves would inevitably flow from the crunch affecting freight. ""Going forward, we need to be looking at the whole of the supply chain,"" he said. ""We need to be working with the new government on how we make that more sustainable and better for the entire country. ""The increasing in shipping costs that we've seen over the last few years, for example, are out of this world. ""Where it used to cost $1200 to send a container from Shanghai to Melbourne, it's now $12,000. ""It's sucking the life out of our economy … and shipping costs go through to your fuel."" Mr Forrest from the RAC backed calls for an extension of the fuel excise cut or any other measures that would provide relief for struggling motorists. He said fuel was a major cost for most households but its volatile and ""in your face"" nature meant it had an outsized effect on consumer confidence. On top of this, he said it was often more vulnerable consumers such as those living in remote or regional areas, or those on low incomes, that were hit hardest. ""Fuel pricing, just by the way it sold … there are not many other products with their prices put up by the side of the road,"" Mr Forrest said. ""You don't see that with milk or other products. ""It's right in people's faces and it's something that they have to buy regularly as well just to make their lives function. ""So, it does feel quite financially painful and people do feel like they're getting ripped off.""

17,Ziggy the bag man's mission to access his money and help other vulnerable people,business,"  Ziggy the Brisbane bag man's mission to access his money in the bank puts spotlight on homeless struggle Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Zbygnew Wilczek has lived in parks around Brisbane's western suburbs for years, among dozens of plastic bags, cardboard boxes and umbrellas. Better known as Ziggy the bag man, the grey-haired character is well-known around the city and usually likes to keep to himself. But recently his friends got in touch with ABC Radio Brisbane's Rebecca Levingston — Ziggy needed help. Specifically, he needed help accessing money he held in a NAB account. ""I've got over $20,000 but I can't get to it to pay anybody. I can't get to it to get one of those card things,"" he said, before telling Levingston he hadn't visited a bank for at least eight years. ""The National Bank, they're making it so hard and they're also making me look a real pig-type person, a monster who just uses people and wants to rob them. And I'm not made that way. ""The manager said that their way of doing things is they can't come out here. ""I even got [an] officer of the law to go to them and they told her that they can't even give her money, that they don't know it's me. I'm world famous and yet my bank doesn't know who I am? ""They probably drive by here every now and then and they still don't know who I am."" Ziggy said a NAB employee told him to visit a branch to get the necessary paperwork sorted so he could withdraw money, however the elderly man preferred to stay away, saying he would not go in ""a suit and tie"". ""I'll go in with 20 bags. I'll come in with half of my world, how's that going to look?"" he said. ""Just come out here with the papers, so I can sign [them], so everything can start coming out and [we don't] have to touch because of the corona [virus]. I'm very scared of that. ""I'm close to 70 and I don't want to drop dead yet. I've got lots of life still."" Levingston took Ziggy's story to the bank, and NAB retail executive general manager Krissie Jones said it was ""very important"" customers could access banking services. ""Sandra from our team went to see Ziggy and they've been able to determine a solution that's going to work for him ongoing,"" she said. ""We want to make sure he has a tailored solution. ""He was really pleased he was able to have an option each time he needs access to his money."" Ziggy was not just concerned at his own situation, he was worried other vulnerable people might also struggle to access essential services. Ms Jones said the pandemic had definitely revealed that sometimes ""not everyone wants to go into a branch to get their money or [they] aren't able to"". She said NAB offered ATMs and services at Australia Post for deposits and withdrawals and computer-savvy customers could use internet banking or the NAB app. ""However in some cases, and you can imagine, refugees coming into the country from Ukraine, for example, or customers who might be fleeing from domestic violence or even in natural disasters, that sometimes it's really tricky and not everyone has the right, conventional forms of ID on them,"" Ms Jones said. ""So we do have some alternative options in those scenarios. ""We have a customer service hub which really supports customers in this different and unique situations, to make sure we can identify them because we want to make sure we're keeping people's money secure but once they're identified, to provide them with access to their money."" Accessing welfare, banking and other services was often overwhelming for those on the streets or without strong supports, said Rees Maddren, service manager for Anglicare Southern Queensland's INSYNC Youth Services. He said Centrelink and bank staff were often complying with their organisation's rules and could not help. ""Now, especially, Centrelink has social workers, who once they know someone is homelessness, they start going above and beyond what they usually do,"" Mr Maddren said. ""If they come to an organisation like us, we start negotiating identification, we have to support them to get documents, to get birth certificate reissued, to open a bank account. ""It's hard to navigate if you don't have people in the system helping you. ""If I had a wishlist for banks or others, it would be if you find out people are homeless, make some concessions and have some understanding. ""Put them in touch with someone who can help navigate the system.""

18,How an 'outdated association with criminality' is leaving tattoo studios facing closure,business,"  Insurance premiums for tattoo shops leaving businesses facing the prospect of closure Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For the past eight years, a tattoo studio has occupied 205 Brisbane Street in Ipswich, but that's about to change. Family-owned business Compass Tattoo will shut its doors in six months' time, with nowhere to go. A recent change in their landlord's insurance has forced their eviction, creating a frightening ultimatum: pay $30,000 a year — on top of their normal expenses — to keep their prime spot or get out. ""Our landlord has come to us and said the only way they can renew our lease is if we take on a pretty substantial landlord insurance bill,"" co-owner of the studio Angela Nayler said. ""His insurance every year is around $11,000 for the building. This year, if he keeps Compass Tattoo as a tenant, he's looking at around $41,000."" The mother of three said it's a bill the business simply cannot afford. ""He wants to keep us on. He's tried over 20 insurance companies and they all say the same thing — they won't insure him if there's a tattoo store in the building, because we're classed as high risk,"" she said. ""There are only a few [insurers] in Australia who will cover us, and they're able to push up prices as much as they like."" Ms Nayler said she had contacted over a dozen other insurers in a desperate search for an explanation for why tattoo studios were classed as high risk. She said a broker at Shield Insurance told her many insurers would not cover tattoo parlours ""due to gang affiliation and all of those sorts of things"". In a statement, Shield Insurance said ""insurers generally relay broad feedback such as it being outside of their underwriting scope, due to the high risk of the activity."" ""Gallagher Insurance has a facility for tattoo artists and to my knowledge this is the only option in-market."" Arthur J Gallagher insurance has been contacted for comment. An Insurance Council of Australia spokesman said capital is harder to come by so insurers' risk appetites are lower. ""Each insurer bases the offering of a premium on their claims experience,"" a spokesman said. ""An increase in claims activity in a segment can lead to an increase in premiums for that segment, or the insurer choosing not to offer insurance to that segment at all."" Matthew Sullivan from Eternal Mark Tattoo in Gympie said he had been made to feel like a criminal, despite having never been behind bars or committing a crime. ""I don't feel like I fall under the category of [an artist] or anything like that,"" he said. ""I'm basically put in the category of outlaw motorcycle member even though I'm not."" His rent has doubled this year after his landlord copped an insurance price hike of $16,000 because he had a tattooist as a tenant. ""We've gone from having an insurance premium of $4,000 to like over $20,000,"" he said. ""I have to pass the extra cost to the customer."" He said he feared the extra cost on top of his other expenses could put him out of business. ""Some days I feel like shutting the doors because I'm copping all these extra payments and I'm just like what's the worth?"" Mr Sullivan said. ""Something's got to change otherwise we're going to see a lot more small businesses shut down."" Australian Tattooist Guild president Alex Cairns said it was a ""common"" issue nationwide. ""Almost every tattoo shop owner that I've spoken to in the last two years has the same problem,"" he said. He said the industry had moved beyond its dark past with organised crime. ""I think there's an outdated association with an element of criminality,"" he said. ""That's a couple of decades out of date."" In order for tattooists to be licensed, they have to undergo strict background checks, including fingerprinting in both Queensland and New South Wales. ""You'd be pretty hard pressed to find examples where there was [links to organised crime]."" Red Hill building owner Samantha Morrison made the decision to evict her ""loyal"" tattooist tenant after she received an updated building insurance bill for an additional $10,000. ""We're losing the best tenant that we've ever had,"" she said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Ms Morrison said when she questioned the price hike with her insurance company she was told it was because of the tattoo parlour. ""[They] mentioned Molotov cocktails, bombings,"" she said. ""It's unfair, it's discriminatory. ""Our tenant has no affiliates whatsoever — not even a parking ticket in his criminal history. ""I don't think this is beneficial for anyone except the people who are getting paid big commissions and throwing these bogus charges on poor little mum-and-dad businesses.""

19,A season of Survivor was being filmed when Fiji's second wave hit. The navy came to help,business,"  Survivor, Bachelor in Paradise, Love Island: How Fiji is cashing in on reality TV favourites Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog In the office of the Fiji film commission there is a map of the 330-island archipelago and dotted across it are miniature movie posters and the very recognisable logos of some of the world's most popular reality television shows. It's a record of the productions that have been shot in Fiji and just how far their crews have ventured across the Pacific Island nation. Seasons of Survivor, Love Island, and Bachelor in Paradise as well as the films Castaway, Adrift and Blue Lagoon have all been shot in Fiji. For Fijian crews and film students, the productions are helping to develop a local industry. And for those who look after Fiji's national budget, enticing more of the global film industry to the country's shores presents a very good opportunity to put its natural assets to work. ""Fiji has a unique characteristic when it comes to that tropical location scenario,"" Films Fiji chief executive Ramiro Tenorio said. Fiji is a direct 10-hour flight from Los Angeles, with commercial flights arriving every day. From there, crews can be in locations that appear very remote on screen pretty quickly. On top of the geographical advantage, Fiji's world-famous tourism industry is experienced at housing, feeding and entertaining large groups of visitors. So some of the practical challenges that can come with running a television or film set in a remote location are made a little easier. ""Fiji has incredibly pristine locations and it's very well connected for where it is,"" Mr Tenorio said. ""It's very easy for productions to find the infrastructure that they need."" Accommodation for visitors to Fiji ranges from family resorts to luxury villas on private islands, so if you did need to house a superstar, there are options. From 2016 to 2019, Mr Tenorio estimates about 15 major productions a year were being shot in Fiji — most of them reality television. One of the original reality television shows is, of course, Survivor. The United States version of the show aired the finale of its 41st season in December, proving that even in the cutthroat television industry, it's possible to outwit, outplay and outlast. Both the 41st and 42nd seasons were filmed in Fiji throughout 2021 and were the only international productions to shoot there that year. Fiji's international border shut in March 2020, but its COVID Risk Mitigation Taskforce (CRMT) worked with Survivor to get crews safely into the country. When the Survivor crews and cast arrived, Fiji was COVID-free and had been for a year, but halfway through filming, the country experienced a deadly second wave of infections. Fijian authorities helped to keep the cameras rolling. ""A lot of rethinking had to be done very quickly on how to help them finish the show safely,"" Mr Tenorio said. ""There are a lot of logistics involved in how you move crews and equipment, not just internationally, but nationally when you have restrictions in place for the safety of the country."" The Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Health, the national COVID task force, Fiji's national airline, as well as its navy were all involved. ""They provided continuous support to the production trying to figure out the best procedures … making sure that everything was as safe as it had to be at that very high-risk moment — both when they came in, but [also] at the height of the outbreak,"" Mr Tenorio said. Mr Tenorio said the navy was very involved in helping establish a safe corridor so Survivor crews could move around and filming could continue. ""By the end of the show, they hadn't lost a single day of production,"" Mr Tenorio said. It might seem like a lot of effort for a government to go to for a reality television show, but Fiji is a small country looking for big investment. There are ambitions for the film and television sector to become ""a main pillar of the economy"", according to Mr Tenorio. He says being known as a location that will help keep productions on schedule and on budget, even in the most trying of circumstances, will work in Fiji's favour in the long run. Even in the short term, the 2021 Survivor productions made an impact. In a year when the tourism industry — a business that usually employs 150,000 people and brings in 40 per cent of Fiji's national revenue — was forced to close, the cash injection from Survivor was a welcome one. The two seasons of Survivor shot in Fiji in 2021 brought in a direct local investment of $25 million. It is estimated that for every dollar a production spends in Fiji, another $1.50 is generated simply by the engagement of local staff and businesses, eating at local restaurants and buying locally sourced items and produce. For last year's Survivor productions, 408 local staff were employed. ""That's how important one production can be,"" Mr Tenorio said. ""When you have a location that's not necessarily going through the best economic time, and then that group of villages receives a lot of investment in a very short amount of time, it's tremendously valuable."" Shooting in Fiji is also a very good deal for shows like Survivor. Attorney-General and Minister for Economy Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum said despite the advantages there was still a need to lure productions to Fiji, and part of the government's effort included a significant tax rebate. ""One of the things we probably lack in Fiji is we don't have readily available post-production services, we don't have equipment. A lot of production houses need to bring it all in,"" he said. But once in Fiji, productions like Survivor are entitled to a 75 per cent tax rebate on the costs they incur locally. To get the rebate, there is a list of conditions productions have to meet. Fiji's government also needs to approve the scripts. And the film commission is conscious of keeping some of the country's most pristine beaches and secluded spots as exclusive locations, so they are careful to ensure these aren't used too often. One of the requirements for any production shooting in Fiji is that it engages with film and television students at the national university. ""We are hoping to build local capacity so [productions] don't have to bring in every member of the crew from overseas,"" Mr Sayed-Khaiyum said.

20,Japan claims China is trying to extract Japanese gas in East China Sea,business,"  Japan protests Beijing's extraction of undersea gas reserves in East China Sea Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Japan has lodged an official protest with China after discovering what it claimed were efforts by Beijing to develop gas fields in disputed waters in the East China Sea. Tokyo's foreign ministry said it had confirmed that Beijing was building in the area — where the two countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZ) overlap — and submitted a complaint to the Chinese embassy. Japan ""strongly urged an early resumption of negotiations over the implementation"" of a 2008 bilateral agreement regarding the development of resources in the East China Sea, it added. That agreement saw Japan and China agree to jointly develop undersea gas reserves in the disputed area, with a ban on independent drilling by either country. But negotiations over how to implement the deal were suspended in 2010. ""It's extremely regrettable that the Chinese side is unilaterally proceeding with development in the waters,"" the ministry said. ""The borders of the economic exclusive zones and the continental shelf are yet to be settled in the East China Sea."" Japan has long insisted the median line between the two nations should mark the limits of their respective EEZs. But China insists the border should be drawn closer to Japan, taking into account the continental shelf and other features of the ocean. Tokyo accused China of positioning 17 suspected drilling rigs close to its de facto maritime border with Japan. The rigs are on China's side of the border, but Tokyo fears gas on the Japanese side can also be extracted. The two countries are embroiled in a separate row over disputed islands elsewhere in the East China Sea. China claims the string of islands — which Japan refers to as the Senkakus — as its own, and regularly sends ships and aircraft into the area to test Tokyo's response times. China also has disputes with several other nations in the South China Sea, which it claims in its entirety.

21,Russia confirms it has stopped gas exports to Finland,business,"  Russia confirms it has stopped gas exports to Finland for failing to pay in roubles Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Russia's Gazprom has halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland, confirming what Finnish system operator Gasgrid Finland said earlier. After Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Moscow has asked clients from ""unfriendly countries"" — including EU member states — to pay for gas in roubles, a way to sidestep Western financial sanctions. Gazprom said in a statement it had ""completely stopped gas deliveries"" as it had not received rouble payments from Finland's state-owned energy company, Gasum, ""by the end of the working day on May 20"". ""Starting April 1, payments for gas need to be made in roubles using new bank details, about which the counterparts were informed in a timely manner,"" Gazprom said. Some of Europe's major economic powers still rely heavily on Russian gas to power their economies. Gazprom said it had supplied 1.49 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Finland in 2021, equal to about two-thirds of the country's gas consumption. But natural gas accounts for around eight per cent of Finland's energy. Finland said it would make up for the shortfall from other sources through the Baltic connector pipeline, which connects Finland to Estonia, and assured filling stations would run normally. Saturday's halt to gas shipments follows Moscow cutting off Poland and Bulgaria last month in a move the European Union described as ""blackmail"".

22,Why is Indonesia's President hanging out with 'super genius' Elon Musk?,business,"  Why is Indonesia's President Joko Widodo hanging out with Elon Musk? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Indonesia's President Joko Widodo visited Washington last weekend along with other South-East Asian leaders, as his US counterpart Joe Biden seeks to court the region against growing Chinese influence. But it was a trip to the small town of Boca Chica, Texas, that attracted more attention back home in Indonesia. Mr Widodo had lined up a high-profile meeting with Tesla and Space X founder Elon Musk at the private space agency's headquarters, where he was given a private tour. As Mr Widodo praised the tech baron as a ""super genius"", Mr Musk declared he was ""very interested"" in the future of Indonesia, a country of 270 million people. The world's richest man also said the country exuded ""positive energy"". ""We're going to look, from a Tesla and Space X standpoint, to try and do some partnerships in Indonesia,"" Mr Musk said, flagging ""future collaboration on many fronts"". Indonesia, South-East Asia's largest economy, seeks to cash in on the global transition to electric vehicles (EVs) by luring foreign investment from the likes of Mr Musk. Nickel is a key component of lithium-ion battery cells, which are used in most EVs. So demand for the metal is rapidly increasing. Australia has the critical minerals, now we just need the industry around it. Sumitomo Metal Mining — Japan's largest nickel smelter and a supplier for the Panasonic lithium-ion batteries used in Tesla EVs — said in March it expected global demand for nickel to increase by 20 per cent during 2022 alone. According to research firm Wood Mackenzie, nickel consumption for EV batteries is projected to increase 64 per cent between 2019 and 2025. Along with Australia, Indonesia has the world's largest nickel reserves, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), an American government body. USGS reports that mine production in Indonesia increased by 30 per cent during 2021, which it attributed to the ""ongoing commissioning"" of projects across the resource-rich archipelago. Mr Widodo's visit to Space X followed a recent meeting between Mr Musk and senior minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, and Indonesian officials told Reuters that working-level discussions on investment in the nickel industry had already taken place. Indonesia's Minister for Investment, Bahlil Lahadalia, said Mr Musk would ""lose out"" if he did not invest in the country. ""I think it's great that Indonesia has a big population and the population is growing,"" Mr Musk said during his meeting with Mr Widodo in Texas. ""This is very good. Because, like, we need a lot of people for the future — and also Mars. Mars does not have any people, so we need people for Mars,"" he joked. ""Indonesia seems very optimistic and positive about the future, which is awesome,"" Mr Musk added. ""I'm really fired up by how fired up you all are."" But not everyone is so excited by the prospect of further investment in nickel mining in Indonesia, which is associated with coal-fired power plants. When this diver saw more rubbish than fish in the ocean, she took action. A group of Indonesian environmental activists have written to Mr Musk, pointing to previous statements the billionaire has made around environmental sustainability. ""If Tesla wants to invest in Indonesia, they should make it free from coal-fired power plants,"" said Pius Ginting, coordinator of the Action for Ecology and People's Emancipation Association (known by its Indonesian acronym AEER), in the letter. ""Because doing so conflicts with the aim of electric transportation: reducing total gas emission,"" he added. In mid-2020, Mr Musk called upon mining firms to boost their production of nickel to meet Tesla's needs. ""Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way,"" Mr Musk said at the time. Indonesia has long sought to boost domestic processing of nickel ore and other minerals — not just exporting the raw product — partly as a way to create local jobs. But smelting nickel in Indonesia often relies on energy from coal, and environmentalists say the country's nickel industry does not meet ""environmentally sensitive"" standards. While Indonesia has committed to ending the construction of new coal-fired power plants after 2023, coal power generation remains a key source of energy and accounts for more than a third of the country's total carbon emissions. Moh Taufik hopes Tesla will consider environmental harm caused by mining companies on the island of Sulawesi — the source of much of Indonesia's nickel. ""Nickel mining activity has violated residents' rights to breathe in clean air,"" Mr Taufik, coordinator of Mining Advocacy Network (JATAM) in the province of Central Sulawesi, told the ABC. A 2019 study by AEER found that coal plants used for the production of nickel in the Central Sulawesi town of Morowali had caused respiratory infections among local residents. AEER reports that disposal methods by nickel plants in Sulawesi pose ""a grave threat to the rich marine life in Indonesia's seas"" and affect the livelihoods of fishermen. ""If the company wants to invest in the area, hopefully it's not planning to throw hazardous waste used as raw materials for electric vehicles [into] the sea in Morowali and other regions,"" Mr Taufik said. AEER argues that when small-scale nickel mining operations began in Morowali in the late 2000s, traditional farmers in the area were affected by floods exacerbated by the extractive industry. Environmentalists in Indonesia claim that among the thousands of tonnes of paper bales sent to East Java are household waste items including faeces-contaminated nappies. Morowali is now the site of the largest nickel-based industrial area in Indonesia, funded by domestic and Chinese investors. And in 2020, flash floods hit Morowali, swamping two villages and forcing 175 residents to evacuate. Mr Taufik said the Indonesian government must also weigh the consequences for residents if Tesla ever builds a facility in Sulawesi. ""The government have to determine whether this decision will benefit local residents or will just trigger land conflicts between company and residents,"" he said. ""Tesla's decision to come and build a power plant might remove residents from their living or working areas, like farms."" ""This very likely to happen and local residents will definitely lose."" The Indonesian Environment Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Tesla was also approached for comment.

23,"When Parkinson’s disease started to affect her makeup artistry, Terri knew she had a job to do",business,"  Fashion and beauty innovators see opportunities for disability inclusion to cater for 'trillion-dollar' market Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Parkinson's disease started preventing makeup artist Terri Bryant from being able to draw the simplest of lines, she knew she had to do something about it. Ms Bryant is part of a growing movement in the fashion and beauty industry, which is developing products for and with people with disability — recognising a virtually untapped trillion-dollar customer market. Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes tremors, balance problems and weakness, including in grip strength. Ms Bryant, who has worked for years as a professional makeup artist, started her accessible business Guide Beauty after she began to struggle using her usual cosmetic instruments. ""What I thought were simple techniques that I used to be able to knock out in 15 minutes … I just couldn't get it quite right. I couldn't get the control,"" she said. The problems she was having inspired her to design cosmetic tools that were suitable for everyone regardless of their level of disability. ""I ran home, and I pulled out my makeup kit and I pulled out my husband's tool kit. And I started prototypes,"" Ms Bryant explained. ""I actually ended up developing the brand because I got Parkinson's [and] when I got my diagnosis, there was something kind of empowering in the moment."" She launched Guide Beauty in 2020 and the business has been a huge success for representing people with disabilities. Ms Bryant tried several styles before choosing tools that were built to a universal design standard so they're comfortable for everyone. The tools are designed to have large grips, facets for resting, and bring the handle closer to the face to make the application stable and easy to use. ""We could kind of help shift the narrative so that people could understand the value of inclusive representation on a design level, because that makes sense from a business perspective,"" she said. ""That makes what is the right thing to do, also a smart business decision. ""The fact the industry has responded so well makes me realise that I don't think we're going to be alone in this space for long. I think people are going to be starting to shift their design process."" Ms Bryant is not the only one to have found their calling. James Parr admits his journey to becoming one of Australia's most sought-after models with a disability had a bumpy start. When he was dignaosed with osteosarcoma, a form of bone cancer, and was told his leg needed to be amputated, he thought it would ruin his life. ""I would say to my friends, 'if the leg goes, I go, I'm not doing it',"" Mr Parr said. ""When it actually came to the surgeon telling me the best option is to amputate, I was like 'cool, let's do it'. And it happened five days later."" Mr Parr was back in the gym 10 days after the surgery and said the amputation gave him a reason to start modelling, to change the narrative that having a disability was a sad outcome. ""I was like, 'I don't align with being sad or I don't align with it as a negative thing,'"" he said. ""It does bring more opportunities … I think part of why I love it and why I get myself out there and I'm so passionate about it, is representation."" He hopes to expand his public image from ""disabled model"" to ""model with a disability"". ""I'm trying to really hone my craft … I am a disabled model, but I want to be a model who has a disability … I just want to change that a bit because it's a bit devaluing."" Mr Parr has been represented by international inclusive talent agency Zebedee Talent and had just walked the 2022 Melbourne fashion week runway with his prosthetic leg in clear view. Launched in 2017, Zebedee Talent represents diverse models, with a focus on talent with disabilities, visible differences and those from the LGBTQIA+ community. Zebedee senior model booker for Australia and America, Victoria Johnson, said the disability modelling industry was a financially important but often overlooked side of the business. ""Disabled people make up 20 per cent of society so it is really important that disabled people are included and visible in such a huge industry, Ms Johnson said. ""It is the ethical right thing to do, and it is also the economically right thing to do. The spending power of disabled people worldwide is $1.2 trillion, so it makes sense for a business to be inclusive."" The fashion industry is worth $27.2 billion in Australia, but what do you do when the fashion industry wasn’t built for you? ""The spending power of disabled people worldwide is 1.2 trillion dollars so it makes sense for a business to be inclusive. ""It is really important for people with disabilities to feel represented and to feel self-worth."" Zebedee was started in the UK by two sisters-in-law both with experience in modelling and disability support. The agency represents some famous talents including British Model Ellie Goldstein, who has down syndrome. Zebedee only launched in Australia last year and already represents 60 talent with over 600 worldwide. According to Ms Johnson and Zebedee junior model booker, Maddie Kalman, Australia is leading the way for disability representation in the industry. ""I think it's really important to be diverse in that way in the fashion industry in Australia,"" Ms Kalman said. ""I think Australia is getting there with diverse and inclusive representation, we still have a long way to go, but we won't stop until 20 per cent of people featured in advertising and fashion are inclusive of people with disabilities. ""But I think it's really important … even if there's not room, let's make room."" Ms Johnson said some of the important international fashion events in Europe, America and the UK did not always make room for models with disabilities. ""We're not sure why they're struggling with inclusivity in fashion shows, to be honest,"" Ms Johnson said. ""It feels like you take a step forward and one or two back, but hopefully we can get to that place again, with our models working in the major places. ""We were really successful at Melbourne fashion week. Most of the shows did include a model with a disability or difference, which was awesome."" In Australia, adaptive clothes are considered assistive technology and can be purchased through the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Emma Clegg, occupational therapist and co-founder of adaptive clothing company JAM-the-Label said the NDIS had made it easier for people to purchase high-end accessible clothes. ""The Australian market is quite unique in that we have the NDIS, a lot of other countries don't have a similar funding model,"" Ms Clegg said. ""And so people can actually purchase adaptive clothing through their NDIS plans as low-cost assistive technology because it assists in active dressing and promotes independence and participation in an everyday skill or task."" Ms Clegg and her business partner launched JAM in 2017 to help people like their clients wear comfortable and fashionable clothing that worked better in wheelchairs. Some of the design features include shorter backs on jackets so extra fabric doesn't bunch up between the wearer and the wheelchair, fully zippable sleeves and sides on tops, poncho-style opening on jackets, carry bags and the absence of itchy tags. JAM model Jason Clymo said the NDIS made it easier for him to buy comfortable adaptive clothes instead of mainstream items that caused pressure sores. ""Before I was on the NDIS, I actually didn't even really engage very much with the adaptive fashion industry because I didn't really know much about it,"" Mr Clymo said. ""It was actually through meeting JAM-the-Label that I realised that adaptive fashion was becoming quite a large part of the industry and realising that this was actually a really good option for me."" Ms Kalman said tokenism was still a problem in the industry, with a lot of major brands booking one model with a disability just for publicity. ""They're getting the jobs which is great, but it's like some brands are just ticking a box and they're having like a token disabled person to make themselves look inclusive, but they're not really,"" she said. Mr Clymo, who has represented mainstream modelling agency Wink as well as Zebedee, said he hoped in the future segregation in the fashion industry would vanish. He said having models with and without a disability showcasing the same products would hopefully educate the industry more broadly, and the practice would become mainstream.

24,Canada bans China's Huawei Technologies from 5G networks,business,"  Canada bans China's Huawei Technologies from 5G networks Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Wireless carriers in Canada won't be allowed to install Huawei equipment in their high-speed 5G networks, the Canadian government said on Thursday, joining allies in banning the giant Chinese technology company. Canada had been the only member of the Five Eyes intelligence-pooling alliance not to bar or restrict use of equipment from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in its 5G networks. The US and the other members — the UK, Australia and New Zealand — previously banned Huawei. ""We are announcing our intention to prohibit the inclusion of Huawei and ZTE products and services in Canada's telecommunications systems,"" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said. Canada's ban also includes ZTE Corp, one of China's biggest tech companies and one that is state-owned. Mr Champagne added that ""providers who already have this equipment installed will be required to cease its use and remove it."" He said Canada's wireless companies won't be offered compensation. Chinese state media is awash with the news of the return of ""Huawei princess"" Meng Wanzhou. But for more than a day, it remained silent on a key detail of the story — the release of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Canada's major wireless companies already had started working with other providers. ""There are many hostile actors who are ready to exploit vulnerabilities in our defences,"" Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said. Mr Mendicino said the government did an extensive review and is redoubling efforts to protect Canadians. China condemned the move against one of its national champions as a form of ""political manipulation"" carried out in coordination with the US, which was aimed at ""suppressing"" Chinese companies in violation of free-market principles. ""China will comprehensively and seriously evaluate this incident and take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies,"" the Chinese Embassy in Canada said in a statement posted on its website. China commonly employs such language in commercial disputes, which often does not lead to a firm response from Beijing. The US government has been lobbying allies like Canada for years to exclude Huawei from new ultra-fast 5G mobile networks over worries that China's communist rulers could compel the company to help with cyber espionage. The US has warned it would reconsider intelligence sharing with any countries that use Huawei gear. Political editor Andrew Probyn takes a deep dive into Huawei's history to unpick the anxiety within the Australian intelligence community. The company has repeatedly denied the allegations. ""We're disappointed but not surprised. We're surprised it took the government so long to make a decision,"" Huawei spokesman Alykhan Velshi said. ""We see this as a political decision, one born of political pressure primarily from the United States."" Mr Velshi said there will be Huawei equipment in Canada for years to come. He said the company has more than 1,500 employees in Canada and two-thirds of them work in research and development. The development of 5G, or fifth-generation, networks will give people speedier online connections and provide vast data capacity to meet ravenous demand as more and more things link to the internet and innovations such as virtual reality, immersive gaming and autonomous vehicles emerge. Huawei is the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies. It has been a symbol of China's progress in becoming a technological world power — and a subject of US security and law enforcement concerns. Some analysts say Chinese companies have flouted international rules and norms and stolen technology. China, the US and Canada completed what was effectively a high-stakes prisoner swap last year involving a top executive from Huawei who had been charged with fraud by the US. What exactly is Huawei and why does it seem like it's continually being targeted by foreign governments? China jailed two Canadians shortly after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, Huawei Technologies' chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder, on a US extradition request. They were sent back to Canada in September, the same day Ms Meng returned to China after reaching a deal with US authorities in her case. Many countries labelled China's action ""hostage politics,"" while China has described the charges against Huawei and Ms Meng as a politically motivated attempt to hold back China's economic and technological development. ""The decision should have been taken two or three years ago, but it's a case of better late than never,"" Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said of the move to ban Huawei. ""We are faced with a China that is a lot more aggressive in the conduct of its foreign policy but also in the way it obtains information to achieve its goals."" Mr Saint-Jacques said that under Chinese law no company can refuse a request from the Chinese government to share information, so it would have been impossible to allow Huawei's participation. He expects China to retaliate. ""I expect we will hear from them pretty rapidly,"" he said. ""They use trade as a weapon and I suspect that's what we'll see in this case.""

25,"'No waste' flour mill in Ballarat to create hundreds of jobs in construction, manufacturing",business," ABC Rural 'State-of-the-art' flour mill in Ballarat to create hundreds of jobs in construction, manufacturing Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A major investment by one of the largest food manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand is creating a jobs boost in Ballarat. George Weston Foods will invest $132.9 million to build a new flour mill in the Ballarat West Employment Zone. It will create 174 new jobs in Victoria and transfer 46 jobs from an existing flour mill in North Melbourne to Ballarat, with an additional 320 jobs during the mill's construction. George Weston Foods is known for big brands including Don smallgoods, Abbotts, and Tip Top bread. Minister for Industry Support and Recovery, Martin Pakula, said the state government has financially assisted the project, but refused to reveal the value of that investment. George Weston Foods is also broadening its horizons in other areas of regional Victoria by creating a new national Tip Top boutique bakery in Bendigo and upgrading its Don KRC business in Castlemaine to grow exports. Chief executive of George Weston Foods, Stuart Grainger, said he is striving for the new mill to be the most environmentally sustainable of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. ""The mill itself is going to be absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of very low power usage, ultra efficient processing. Literally, I don't think there is anything like it,"" he said. ""It'll have a footprint that will be significantly better than anything else of its type. ""There won't be any waste. Anything that's not used for human food will go to animal feed."" Mr Grainger said the ingredients sourced to make the company's bread and baked goods were almost exclusively from Victorian farms. ""We are excited to be investing in the future of sustainable agriculture and food production in Victoria,"" he said. ""The state is certainly a centre for the food industry — for availability of ingredients, people, and customers."" Mr Pakula's visit to Ballarat also included a stop to the region's largest tourist attraction, Sovereign Hill. Against the backdrop of the attraction's famous gold panning precinct, $6 million was announced to build new cultural and event spaces under the state government's Regional Tourism Investment Fund. Among the new spaces will be the Waterside and Wadawurrung Cultural Precinct, which will encourage visitors to learn about traditional owners. Up to 69 construction jobs and 11 ongoing employment positions will be created from the two-year project, due for completion by mid-2024.

26,Winegrape growers worried for future as forecast shows 'disastrous' next season outlook,business," ABC Rural Growers may dump more grapes next season as wine glut grim forecast continues Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Winegrape growers are calling for government assistance with an oversupply of grapes that is sinking prices and leaving fruit unsold. The crisis in the global freight sector, along with China's decision to impose massive anti-dumping tariffs just as Australian growers produced a large crop in 2021 are behind the glut. The latest Wine Australia figures show exports were down 26 per cent year-on-year. This has been coupled with rising input costs, which have at least doubled in the past year due to increased disease-pressure and the cost of chemical, fertiliser, fuel and labour. Industry body Australian Grape and Wine said it expected difficult commercial conditions for the next three to five years. ""It’s a tough message to deliver, but we can’t afford to stick our heads in the sand,"" Australian Grape and Wine chief executive Tony Battaglene said. The situation is especially dire in South Australia's Riverland, where 80 per cent of the wine produced is exported. Riverland wine executive officer Lyndall Rowe said while interest from south-east Asian markets had been promising, it could not absorb the supply in the short term. ""It’s still positive because it’s a foundation step … but it will take time to grow.” Ms Rowe said the drop in demand had led many wineries to seek outside storage and build additional tanks. While the region finished harvesting grapes in early May, Riverland's CCW Co-operative chief executive Jim Godden said storage at most wineries was full by March. ""This meant the pace of vintage had to slow down into the swing of when space became available,"" he said. Mr Godden said he did not know how many members were out of contract but had received numerous calls from people trying to find a home for their grapes. The Riverland is home to more than 900 growers but some are choosing to get out of the game. Real estate agent Sam Hayes from Toop Toop Rural said a number of vineyards in the region have been listed recently. ""I think we'll see a generational shift in ownership of vineyards,"" he said. Mr Hayes said while the initial interest was from local buyers, the value for money could attract wider investment. “What is currently a liability could be an asset again very soon.” Recently, Australia's largest family-owned winery, Casella Family Brands, put 35 of their vineyards up for sale across New South Wales and South Australia. Colliers is handling the sale and national director of agribusiness Tim Altschwager said the offering was not related to the current oversupply issues. ""It's contrary to that. Casella is well known for selling into the US market. They've had a record sales year and haven't been affected by that overall,"" Mr Altschwager. In the Riverina, there are growing concerns that wineries could cap grape deliveries for next year, which could see the price of red grape varieties drop even further. Riverina Winegrape Growers president Jeremy Cass said the outlook for next season was ""disastrous"". ""The forecast coming from some of the wineries early, seems to be that they're full,"" Mr Cass said. Fourth-generation Griffith winegrape grower James Cremasco described the current situation as a losing battle, but said they would keep going, as the family always had. ""There is a lot of hardship, and there's generational farmers. I've got mates my own age, they're all talking about 'what are we doing this for?',"" Mr Cremasco said. ""The family's been doing it for so many years and I'd hate to see it go backwards, but at the end of the day dollars do count."" In the Murray Valley it is estimated that 20,000 tonnes of fruit were left unsold this season. Murray Valley Winegrowers executive officer Paul Derrico said anyone who had red grapes that were uncontracted had found it very difficult. ""They're really at the crossroads now as to whether they are going to continue on, and they are looking for any kind of financial assistance they can,"" he said. The grapes that haven't been sold to a winery still need to be harvested, otherwise it can have an impact on the vine and crop for the coming year. ""If we could get some form of assistance … given the heartbreak that growers have gone through over the past few months of not being able to sell their fruit,"" Mr Derrico said. A spokesperson for the Victorian agriculture minister acknowledged winegrape growers were being impacted by global demand and supply chain challenges as a result of the pandemic. ""We are working closely with growers and industry groups to support them to manage these impacts,"" the spokesperson said. Mr Derrico said his organisation had also requested support from the NSW government.

27,"Craig McLachlan drops defamation case against ABC, Nine and Christie Whelan Browne",business,"  Craig McLachlan drops defamation case against ABC, Nine and Christie Whelan Browne Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Actor Craig McLachlan has discontinued his defamation proceedings against the ABC, Nine Newspapers and Christie Whelan Browne on the day the defence case was set to begin. The former Neighbours star will pay the defendants' court costs after abandoning the hearing on its 10th day. McLachlan had sued in the NSW Supreme Court in 2018 over a media investigation detailing allegations of inappropriate behaviour during the 2014 tour of The Rocky Horror Show. The reports, aired on the ABC's 7.30 program and published in the Sydney Morning Herald, alleged the now 56-year-old had indecently assaulted, bullied, harassed and exposed himself to female cast members. McLachlan denied the claims and said they had ended his acting career. On Friday, Acting Justice Carolyn Simpson granted McLachlan's application to seek leave to end the proceedings. Acting Justice Simpson discharged the jury, thanking them for their service over the past two weeks. ""Mr McLachlan has decided not to proceed any further with either of these cases,"" she said. ""That means the case is brought to an end, it's finished."" In a statement, ABC News Director Justin Stevens said it was a ""tremendous result for the women who were brave enough to come forward and tell their stories, particularly Christie Whelan Browne"". ""Eleven women came forward to give evidence against McLachlan,"" Mr Stevens said. ""They would not be silenced. It is crucial that defamation laws also not be used to silence the media in reporting accurately and with integrity on matters of public interest. ""The ABC stands by its journalism. It stands by the women who came forward. It stands by Christie Whelan Browne."" In a statement, McLachlan said: ""I cannot continue to place my family under that strain, and my own mental health will not withstand the continuing pressure."" ""Ending the case now will finally bring to an end the four years we have endured since the publications were first made, as well as avoiding the need for other witnesses to have to endure the cross-examination process."" Marina Olsen, Ms Whelan Browne's lawyer, read a statement on behalf of her client outside court saying she had suffered abuse and threats since coming forward in 2018. Through Ms Olsen, the actor said she and her colleagues felt they had no option but to speak to the media after their complaints about McLachlan fell on deaf ears. ""My name was dragged through the mud and my character and own behaviour was exaggerated and called into question,"" she said. ""I have lost my feeling of safety in the world knowing someone wanted so badly to damage me for simply speaking the truth. ""I am pleased this claim has been withdrawn and I look forward to moving on with my life. ""I hope this is a reminder that women will stand up for themselves and each other, even when threatened by somebody more powerful."" Jurors had heard nine days of evidence, which included testimony by McLachlan, his partner Vanessa Scammell, and friends. In his opening address, McLachlan's barrister Kieran Smark SC said his client was the victim of a ""double-pronged attack ... by two powerful media organisations"". The ABC, Nine and Whelan Browne defended the stories as true and were set to call their first witnesses. The court had been told by the defendants' barrister, Michael Hodge QC, that 11 women who worked with McLachlan during various productions would testify about his inappropriate behaviour. Mr Hodge told the jury three colleagues from The Rocky Horror Show, would testify about alleged indecent touching and kissing during a bedroom scene. It was alleged this behaviour was not part of the show or agreed upon by the other actors. McLachlan gave evidence over several days, saying there was a playful atmosphere on set where theatrical but platonic hugs and kisses were common. The actor said he enjoyed a jovial relationship with many of his colleagues and denied allegations of bullying. McLachlan claimed the media reporting damaged his reputation and caused him to be admitted into a mental health facility in 2018. Mr Hodge repeatedly accused McLachlan of lying in his evidence about behaviour on set, which the actor denied.

28,SA government asks consumer watchdog to investigate price gouging in construction industry,business,"  SA government calls for ACCC investigation into price gouging in construction industry Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Potential price gouging in the construction industry could be investigated after the South Australian government called on the consumer watchdog to intervene. Minister for Housing and Urban Development Nick Champion has written to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), asking it review increased building costs and their impact on housing affordability. Mr Champion said he did so with the support of the state's peak construction body, Master Builders SA, which also expressed concerns that rising costs could hurt the industry. ""We’ve seen reinforcing steel go up 43 per cent, structural timber up 39 per cent,"" he said. ""These are big price pressures on the industry, and we’d like to see the ACCC take a role in making sure there’s not price gouging in this area."" Disruptions to global supply chains through COVID-19, the conflict in Ukraine, and lockdowns in China have caused prices to spike, but Mr Champion said he wanted to limit the impact to Australia. ""When we get big price increases for a number of materials, that creates perfect conditions for people to price gauge, to increase margins, and we want the ACCC to take a role in monitoring that,"" he said. Mr Champion also called upon the federal government and other state premiers to take action. Master Builders Association SA's chief executive officer Will Frogley welcomed a potential ACCC inquiry. He said it was ""certainly the view of many in the industry"" that price gouging was occurring. ""People in the industry accept that while there might be legitimate reasons for some price increases, there’s a widespread view that some suppliers are taking this as an opportunity to increase more than what is a reasonable amount,"" Mr Frogley said. ""If people think the ACCC is looking into the issue, perhaps they won't take those opportunistic price increases."" He added that while ABS data showed the cost of building products rose by 3.8 per cent during the December quarter, the feedback ""from the ground"" was that prices have over-compensated. ""Builders and home buyers are facing unprecedented price increases, and I think it's reasonable to ask the ACCC to make sure they're all legitimate price increases,"" he said. Mr Frogley said while Master Builders hoped prices drop as supply chains stabilise, he was not optimistic of a quick fix. ""Over time, [we] hope these pricing increases abate as supply chains reorganise ... but I can’t really see things improving before the end of this year.""

29,How Scotland could help Australia break free of its crippling housing crisis,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Australia's housing crisis could be tackled by taking inspiration from Scotland, industry leaders say Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The next federal government is being urged to look to the northern hemisphere for possible solutions to Australia's housing and rental crises. The Coalition and Labor have each used the election campaign to outline how they would help give people a leg up onto the property ladder, if elected on Saturday. But University of New South Wales professor of housing research and policy Hal Pawson said longer-term solutions could be found in Scotland's housing policy. ""Scotland's strategy [has] got a huge amount of substance, very much in contrast to its Australian equivalent,"" Professor Pawson said. ""It properly defines the problems that it seeks to address [and] it proposes remedial actions that seem to address those problems. ""The NSW so-called housing strategy doesn't do any of those things."" Scotland's policy aims to deliver more affordable housing, tackle high rents and decarbonise homes while creating jobs. ""Housing to 2040"" promises to build 110,000 affordable homes by 2032, with 70 per cent for social rent. They will be carbon neutral, have digital connectivity and will be built in tandem with local infrastructure so they create so-called ""20-minute neighbourhoods"", where local services are a short drive away. Scotland's 32 local authorities and housing providers will bid for a slice of 18 billion pounds in funding. ""To be blunt, it's about our political choice around [how we use] our capital funding,"" the country's cabinet secretary for housing, Shona Robison, said. While it is an ambitious target, the country has form. Since 2007, Scotland has built 108,000 affordable homes, with the majority for social rent. ""It's about affordable housing to make sure that everyone has a safe, affordable home to live in, whether that's rental or low-cost home ownership,"" Ms Robison said. ""The spin-off benefit is that we can also link in our net-zero ambitions to make those homes more affordable in terms of the running costs of them and helping towards our net-zero climate change targets."" Professor Pawson said in contrast, Australia had not properly invested in social and affordable housing for decades. ""It's about 25 years since Australia stopped having a routine annual public housing construction program,"" he said. ""Since 1996, our population has grown by 40 per cent and the social housing stock has grown by 4 per cent. ""So in other words we've completely failed to grow the capacity of that system to match need and so the shortfall and pressure on that system has increased."" Ms Robison said her country's approach could be emulated elsewhere. ""I would recommend it as a program and a good investment that ticks a number of boxes,"" she said. Professor Pawson and other housing industry leaders say the lack of a national strategy is hurting Australia. ""I think it's partly about federal investment [and] I think it's also about federal leadership. We've had neither in the last few years,"" Professor Pawson said. The head of NSW housing provider Housing Plus, David Fisher, agreed. ""The real barriers are the lack of a coherent plan at a national, state level that sets out clear objectives of how many properties, what type of properties and puts in place the right type of funding agreements that allow that to happen,"" he said. ""That kind of plan gives everyone who operates in the market the platform to source the land, to source builders and actually start to supply that additional housing that's needed."" Mr Fisher and Professor Pawson have criticised the NSW government's housing strategy, describing it as an ""empty document"" that fails to set out firm, costed targets. A spokesperson for NSW Housing Minister Anthony Roberts said the state had increased its social housing by 10 per cent in the past decade. The spokesperson said all tiers of government, as well as the private sector and communities, would need to work together to increase supply. Professor Pawson also blames a lack of investment over the past 25 years for the situation Australia now finds itself in. He said governments had created a system which was ""overly preferential"" of property ownership. ""The value of tax concessions to owner-occupiers and private landlords is around about $100 billion per year, it's a phenomenally large sum,"" he said. ""We're talking huge amounts of money there that are effectively a form of government support for parts of the housing market.""

30,"ASX snaps four-week losing streak, Crown shareholders back $8.9b takeover",business,"  ASX snaps four-week losing streak, Crown shareholders back $8.9b takeover Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian shares rebounded on Friday, driven by gains in export-centric mining stocks after the nation's largest trading partner China cut interest rates to stimulate its slowing economy. The ASX 200 closed 1.2 per cent higher at 7,146 points, a significant improvement over yesterday's heavy losses. The gains came despite another volatile day on Wall Street as investors weighed up the risk of rapid interest rate hikes tipping the US economy into recession. Our latest burst of inflation is weird, and resistant to rate hikes. But if the Reserve Bank isn't careful, too many more rate hikes like this might help bring on a recession. Despite the volatility, the benchmark index managed to jump 0.9 per cent over the five days — and has finally snapped a four-week losing streak. China cut a key lending benchmark (its five-year loan prime rate) by 15 basis points on Friday morning, which boosted sentiment on the local share market. This particular rate influences the pricing of mortgages, and it was a sharper-than-expected cut. By 4:30pm AEST, the Australian dollar fell slightly to 70.4 US cents, though that was after a 1.3 per cent rebound overnight. The local currency was ""underpinned by a weaker US dollar and news that Shanghai ports have resumed 90 per cent of cargo handling capacity,"" said Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Carol Kong. """"We remain confident the Australian dollar can rebound strongly once lockdowns are eased because of China's commitment to ramp up infrastructure spending."" Shareholders of casino operator Crown Resorts have approved a $8.9 billion buyout by US private equity giant Blackstone, with 99.9 per cent of the votes cast at its scheme meeting in favour of the deal. Last month, Crown had postponed its scheme meeting, saying that Blackstone had made good progress in obtaining the gaming regulatory approvals, but have not yet obtained the necessary approvals. The voting results take billionaire James Packer one step closer to an exit route from the embattled casino firm hit by scandals and regulatory setbacks and effectively ending one of Australia's most storied business dynasties. Crown said it had scheduled a court hearing for the scheme on May 24. Mr Packer, Crown's biggest shareholder and founder, will cash in his chips, worth about $3.3 billion, a decade and a half after he created the company. Crown shares closed 0.2 per cent higher at $12.84. Meanwhile, today's best performing local stocks include Life360 (+12.1pc), Altium (+6.2pc), Novonix (+11.7pc), Allkem (+5.2pc) and Chalice Mining (+19.1pc). Chalice shares jumped after the company said it had received final approval for exploration drilling to begin at its Julimar Nickel-Copper-Platinum Group Element project in Western Australia. Blue-chip stocks like REA Group (+3.9pc), APA (+3.6pc), Fortescue Metals (+3.9pc) and Domain (+2.5pc) also helped to drive the market higher. Supermarket giant Woolworths has offered to buy 80 per cent stake in online retailer MyDeal, as it looks to take on major internet retail giants operating in the country, namely Amazon. The $217.4 million deal involves Woolworths paying $1.05 for every share of MyDeal — a near 63 per cent premium to the stock's last close on Thursday. MyDeal's shares surged about 56 per cent and were on track to see their best day ever. Almost 60 per cent of the shares being sold to Woolworths will be from the stake of Sean Senvirtne, MyDeal's chief executive. He will also hold the remaining interest in the company. Analysts at Barrenjoey said in a note that the acquisition looks to be a tacit acknowledgement that Woolworths' marketplace isn't gaining traction. ""Woolworths has struggled to generate returns in non-food businesses, so we question why they would allocate capital like this."" Goldman Sachs strategists predicted a 35 per cent chance of the US falling into recession in the next two years. The Wells Fargo Investment Institute, meanwhile, expects a mild US recession at the end of 2022 and early 2023. On US markets, the S&P 500 closed 0.6 per cent lower, at 3,901 points. The day before, it plunged by more than 4 per cent — its worst one-day loss since June 2020. The Nasdaq slipped by 0.3 per cent to 11,389, while the Dow Jones index dropped 0.8 per cent to 31,253. The S&P 500 has fallen 18 per cent from its January record high, with surging inflation, geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine and the US Federal Reserve's rate hikes clouding the economic outlook. If the S&P closes closes 20 per cent or more below its record high, it would confirm the benchmark index has slid into a bear market. Wall Street was dragged down by shares of tech giant Cisco Systems, which slumped 13.7 per cent after it gave a dismal outlook. The networking gear maker lowered its 2022 revenue growth outlook, taking a hit from its Russia exit and component shortages related to COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Apple and chipmaker Broadcom declined 2.5 and 4.3 per cent, respectively. The argument that wages will grow when unemployment is lower is refuted in a new report by some of Australia's leading industrial relations experts. ""The reality is that inflation is running hot and interest rates are rising,"" Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, said. ""Until you get that inflation rate to start slowing, we're going to have increased volatility, and in our view that continues through throughout most of the summer months."" Twitter climbed 1.2 per cent after Bloomberg reported that company executives told staff that Elon Musk's $US44-billion deal was proceeding as expected and they would not renegotiate the price. Oil prices rallied as China's officials planned to ease restrictions in Shanghai, which could further tighten global energy supply, and as the dollar retreated. Brent crude futures jumped 2.1 per cent, to $US111.37 a barrel. Spot gold lifted 1.4 per cent, to $US1,841.58 an ounce.

31,Legal experts call for more protections for exploited migrant workers,business,"  Legal centres and employer groups call for better protections for migrant workers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Fernanda* was one of around 80 international students underpaid by a cleaning company that went into liquidation and set up under a new name a short time later. It is a practice known as phoenixing, where companies go into liquidation to avoid paying debts, such as entitlements owed to staff. ""I felt exploited and depressed and started going to a psychologist because they make me so feel useless,"" Fernanda said. A recent Senate inquiry found migrant workers like Fernanda were particularly vulnerable to underpayment and exploitation and most did not seek help. As employment groups call for the next federal government to ramp up migration to plug widespread labour shortages, a national coalition of organisations is calling for better protections for those workers to prevent wage theft. Along with the Uniting Church and Ethnic Communities' Council of Victoria, the co-signatories have written to the major parties asking them to act on three key reforms recommended by two recent Senate committees to protect migrant workers from exploitation: At Fernanda's workplace, the majority of her colleagues decided not to take legal action or lodge an underpayment claim against their former employer. ""Almost the whole workforce was international students and many were concerned about taking any action because of the possible risk to their visas,"" Sharmilla Bargon, coordinator at Employment Rights Legal Service, said. Ms Bargon said whistleblower-type protections would encourage more migrant workers to recover underpayments. ""The exploitation of migrant workers is widespread,"" she observed. ""We commonly see people come in and talk to us and they've been paid as little as $12 an hour."" Ms Bargon said the reforms would also act as a deterrent to unscrupulous employers who use deportation as a threat. ""We see employers threatening to report workers to the Department of Immigration with trumped-up visa breaches,"" Ms Bargon said. ""This works: migrant workers are scared to lose their visas and be made to leave Australia."" A survey of 5,000 migrant workers commissioned by the Migrant Justice Initiative in 2019 found three-quarters of participants had been paid less than the minimum wage. Wage theft, exploitation and modern slavery are often reported as isolated scandals — but for many new Australians, they're a fact of life. In a separate study of around 2,200 migrant workers who acknowledged underpayment, only one-in-10 took action to recover money owed. Only 3 per cent had contacted the Fair Work Ombudsman and more than half recovered none of their unpaid wages. Fernanda was repaid $20,000 by the company's administrators after getting help from the Employment Rights Legal Service, but Ms Bargon said other temporary visa holders she has worked with have not been so fortunate because there was often no cash left to pay employees. Ms Bargon said extending the Fair Entitlements Guarantee (FEG) would protect those who could not recover money through a company administrator. The FEG is a federal government scheme that can cover certain unpaid employment entitlements to eligible employees who lose their jobs due to the liquidation or bankruptcy of their employers. ""These migrant workers are paying tax but temporary visa holders are not eligible for the program,"" Ms Bargon said. Economists and business groups expect migration to be critical to addressing labour shortages. Jarrod Bell, chief economist at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), said the next federal government would need to address the issue of stronger protections for migrants. ""This is probably a debate that we need to have, in the wake of COVID,"" he said. ""Obviously, we saw with such a significant proportion of temporary migrants in the economy, over COVID, those people did not have the same access to supports that permanent migrants and residents had. ""We need to look at where these demands are and how we meet them, and how we make sure that we don't see exploitation."" Alexi Boyd, chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (COSBOA), has also backed strengthening protections for migrant workers. ""We are fully in support of anything that protects more businesses' ability to compete with others, and part of that is making sure that everything is fair and equitable,"" she said. “So the small businesses that are working really hard to pay the right wage, figure out the industrial relations, figure out the award wage, and do the right thing by their workers are not disadvantaged by others doing the wrong thing."" When international student Carla asked why she hadn't been paid, she was sacked. A parliamentary committee says wage theft in Australia is widespread. International student Ali*, who was underpaid around $80,000 while working as a casual security guard in Sydney, agrees. “The government should take action on these types of people who are just ripping the international migrants and they are just saying that if you do like this one, we will just cancel your job,” he said. Ali was regularly required to work three consecutive 10-hour shifts with only an hour off between. He was fired when he questioned his employer over pay. When he made a complaint to the Fair Work Ombudsman, his former boss came to his house and told him to stop legal action or they would get him deported back to Pakistan. “Strong laws should be there and there should be proper checks and balances,” he said. The major parties did not respond to the ABC's request for comment. *Names of case studies have been changed for legal reasons We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

32,Millions in JobKeeper went to private schools that grew their surpluses,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Most private schools that took JobKeeper increased their income during the first year of the pandemic, including some of Australia's most exclusive schools. For the first time, the ABC can reveal all 395 non-government schools that reported claiming JobKeeper in 2020 and the amounts they received. The ABC has also analysed the incomes and surpluses of these schools, which reported accessing $769 million in wage support. With taxpayers subsidising pay packets, together these schools more than doubled their surplus in 2020 to almost $1 billion. ""The taxpayer does not need to be subsidising schools that have more money than they know what to do with,"" said investment analyst Dean Paatsch, who has been monitoring the subsidy program. ""JobKeeper topped up their [surpluses] and increased their cash,"" he said. ""They could renovate their boat shed, finish their indoor pools … upgrade their gymnasium and wellness centre — all of those things occurred."" The $89 billion JobKeeper program is estimated to have saved more than 700,000 jobs but has been dogged by questions about the efficiency of that huge spend. Most employers, including private schools, qualified for the subsidy based on a real or projected downturn of 30 per cent in the early months of 2020. The 395 non-government schools that claimed JobKeeper represent a little over 10 per cent of the sector. But 235 of these schools later told the Federal Education Department their incomes had actually increased in 2020 — even without JobKeeper. For schools where incomes were up, they reported receiving at least $315 million in JobKeeper. One hundred and fifty-six schools reported a downturn in recurrent income for 2020, including six that fell by more than 30 per cent, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office. Organisations that qualified during the initial phase of JobKeeper collected $1,500 a fortnight per eligible employee for up to six months — regardless of their later turnover. ""JobKeeper's fatal flaw was that you qualified in an instant, based on a downturn that could have been simply a forecast or temporary,"" Mr Paatsch said. ""[And] it never included a clawback mechanism. ""They could easily have afforded to return it."" Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg previously defended allowing employers to qualify based on projections, and not forcing companies to repay JobKeeper they did not need. ""If we didn't do that … we wouldn't have got the money out the door,"" he told 7.30 last September. ""If they were going to have to pay back that money, then they would haven't necessarily taken it in the first place, and you would have seen jobs being lost."" Mr Frydenberg was unavailable for an interview for this story, but in a statement defended his scheme as ""one of the most successful economic support programs in Australia's history"". Some high-profile institutions that claimed JobKeeper include: The ABC has also analysed the schools' financial filings with the charities regulator, which show JobKeeper schools increasing their surpluses from around $350 million in 2019 to at least $884 million. There is no suggestion that any schools that claimed JobKeeper did anything wrong. Independent Schools Australia, which represents more than 1,000 schools, said its members ""rely heavily on fees paid by parents — many of whom lost jobs or income due to the impacts of COVID-19”. ""JobKeeper has helped save the jobs of teachers and other staff at many independent schools across Australia,"" a spokeswoman said. Revenue among schools that collected JobKeeper in 2020 fell overall by around 1 per cent across the year. ""Teachers weren't stood down [and] school fees continued to be paid by parents,"" Mr Paatsch said. ""JobKeeper in those circumstances makes their labour cheaper, and their [surpluses] increase, and this is what we saw,"" he said. Independent Schools Australia said most boarding schools that qualified for JobKeeper did lose revenue ""when international, regional and interstate students were forced to stay home due to border and health restrictions"". ""Boarding schools do not receive recurrent funding from government to cover the costs of boarding houses,"" a spokeswoman said. Headmaster of The King’s School, Tony George, said support was required at the time, particularly for schools, like his, with boarding students. ""The pandemic presented profound challenges for all schools as they worked to meet the government requirement to remain open, educate Australian children and keep teachers employed,"" he said. ""While government schools continued to be funded directly, the only support available to non-government schools that experienced a loss of income was through the Federal Government’s JobKeeper program. ""Unfortunately, most non-government schools were unable to satisfy the strict eligibility requirements."" Schools provided the income and JobKeeper data to the Education Department, which later provided it to the independent Parliamentary Budget Office, which collated it on behalf of Federal Labor MP Andrew Leigh.

33,'A new standard': How this music festival changed to become more inclusive,business,"  The NT's largest music festival Bass in the Grass improves access for people living with disabilities Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Darwin's largest music festival, Bass in the Grass, normally draws thousands of tourists to the Top End and this year, Jim Simpson and Jeff McCourt are ready to party. The Northern Territory's largest music festival is making it easier for people with a disability to attend Disability organisations say more work is needed to ensure people of all abilities can access major events Access Arts Australia is working on a minimum code of conduct for events Both men live with cerebral palsy and use wheelchairs. ""This one could be really good … to see the music, to see the festival, to see everything,"" Mr McCourt said. The festival is taking place on Saturday and this year, organisers have made a series of adjustments to accommodate people of all abilities. Changes include shaded viewing platforms in front of stages, an accessible entry lane for ticket holders, free entry for carers and pro-floor matting, which makes it easier for people using wheelchairs to move around. Mr McCourt said it was important for people like him to also enjoy music and other events. ""[It was difficult to attend] some events like the super cars, so it's good [to have these adjustments,"" he said. Mr Simpson went to the event last year and took advantage of the viewing platforms, which allowed him to have an unimpeded view of performers. Using non-verbal communication and with the support of an independent living coach he provided a statement. ""I'm excited about going to the festival and dancing on the viewing platform,"" he said. As for the thing he's most excited about for the Saturday event, Mr McCourt had a surprising answer. ""The food!"" The festival's improved access changes have prompted access advocacy groups to demand more from major events. Annie Rily from disability support organisation, Carpentaria, said the festival's adjustments showed it was possible for festivals to be more inclusive. ""Bass in the Grass is setting a new standard this year and we want to see this continue,"" she said. ""We've got 20,000 people in the Territory that have a disability and we want to ensure that they can fully participate in events,"" she said. The issue extends beyond the Territory's borders; Access Arts Australia CEO Matthew Hall said despite good will, many events were falling short. ""Most music festivals [don't do enough] in terms of accessible toilets and viewing platforms and ramps and quiet zones,"" he said. Ability Fest, which was co-founded by Australian of The Year Dylan Alcott, is regularly pointed to as the blueprint for other major events to follow. Consultation is currently underway to create a minimum code of conduct, which Access Arts Australia hopes will be completed next year. Access2Arts Chief Executive Officer, Rebecca Young, hopes the code will provide organisations with a guide on how they can plan events. However, she said it would also act as a means of holding them to account, if they don't sign up. ""There are the best of intentions out there in the marketplace and across a lot of different arts organisations and festivals, but people not knowing where to start is often the first barrier,"" she said.

34,"Lingiari rural voters left feeling 'underrepresented, underwhelmed' by election campaign ",business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Lingiari rural voters left feeling 'underrepresented, underwhelmed' by election campaign Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Determined efforts to win a seat vacated by a long-serving MP have missed the mark with rural voters in the electorate who say they are disengaged from the process as they head to the polls. Rural residents in the seat of Lingiari feel federal candidates aren't fighting for their vote Roads, biosecurity and labour shortages are at the top of their list of issues Many living outside the town centres of Alice Springs and Katherine feel under-represented Both major parties believe they can win the seat of Lingiari, held for more than 30 years by retiring MP Warren Snowden. Federal politicians have flocked to the centres of Alice Springs and Katherine to announce spending promises across the Northern Territory in a bid for votes. However, some people in remote and rural areas of the electorate feel issues important to them, including roads, biosecurity and labour shortages, have received either ""shallow"" promises or little to no attention at all. Stratford Haulage owner Bradley Bloomfield said his trucking service delivered goods and services along some of the Territory's most remote roads. ""I think there's a real failure to consult with people in rural areas, like pastoralists, trucking companies and communities,"" Mr Bloomfield said. ""I'd like to see an improvement in the roads … not just the extension of bitumen highway."" He said single-lane roads with blind corners and harsh shoulders were the most likely sites for crashes. The Coalition has committed $678 million to sealing 1,000km of the Outback Way, a popular tourist route that connects central Queensland to south-east Western Australia. The Labor Party has made a $500 million promise to seal parts of the Tanami and Central Arnhem Road. But Mr Bloomfield said money needed to be spent on regular maintenance of outback roads. ""It would be good to see more graders on the sections that aren't actually paved yet,"" Mr Bloomfield said. Tanami pastoralist Terry Martin the detection potentially industry-crippling foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia had put biosecurity at the top of his list of concerns. ""I'd like to see a bit more power handed to the pastoralist over being able to enforce biosecurity on their properties,"" he said. His Mt Denison property, north-west of Alice Springs, lies between three Indigenous communities and has traffic frequently travelling through without regulation. He said travellers posed a biosecurity risk. ""Everyone has a biosecurity plan in place on their properties, but a lot of people who travel through the properties tend to ignore it,"" Mr Martin said. ""[It would be good to] just ask them, why haven't they reported in and [let them know] that they've breached biosecurity, which is a federal law."" The Coalition announced a $61.6 million boost to biosecurity in northern Australia, with a focus on ""improved diagnostics, industry resilience and implementation of emerging surveillance technologies"". Mr Martin would like to see more attention focused on further developing and streamlining current technologies like the Nation Livestock Identification System. ""A lot of it's just manual entry data entry at the moment or manual uploading, so I suppose if they could make it more automated,"" he said. ""This [the threat of foot and mouth disease] is what it was intended for."" Mr Martin said he was underwhelmed by policy offerings of the Coalition and Labor. ""In the Northern Territory, we feel pretty misrepresented down here in the centre,"" he said. ""A lot of the federal spending … is just spent up north… but it doesn't really make an impact to us."" Further north, towards Tennant Creek, lies Desert Springs Farm, a horticultural operation that produces melons and peanuts. Farm manager Paul McLaughlin said a shortage of labour was pushing some growers to reconsider their future in the industry. ""There're people that might be older, they might be a smaller operation that hasn't built secure labour — they look at [the start of the next season] and say, 'is it really worth the risk of the cost of production'?"" he said. Mr McLaughlin said the Coalition's agricultural visa had merit but it was a long-term solution to an issue that needed solving ""now"". ""The visa will help rural Australia...to bring people in from overseas, but that's a medium to long-term thing,"" he said. ""The government should be looking at how to give people incentives to move into rural areas, right across Australia."" He questioned the influence of rural NT voters in the election. ""We're only a few votes out in the bush really and a lot of votes in the cities,"" he said. ""But at some point, they need to wake up and realise that where their next meal is coming from.""

35,"Mildura desperately needs a rail link to Melbourne, but will it ever happen?  ",business,"  Mildura passenger train critical to reduce 'transport isolation' in Victoria's north-west Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A one-year study has found that reintroducing passenger rail between Mildura and Melbourne is the region's most critical transport need. The North West Victoria Regional Transport Study, prepared by Tonkin Consulting, has set out a list of priority projects for the five regional Victorian council areas along the train line for the next 20 to 30 years. The report noted the north-west's current ""transport isolation"" was particularly damaging for residents' access to healthcare services. This in turn negatively affected the region's general health, while social and economic impacts included limited education choices and working hours lost to long commutes. ""Improved public transport could be an enabler for more socio-economically disadvantaged members of the community to access employment,"" the report read. Report author Paul Simons also noted regional population and transport could be a vicious cycle whereby people were convinced to move to larger, better-serviced regional centres, making it even less cost-effective to provide transport to the fewer remaining people in the smaller regions. ""What the report really touches on is the social inequity of regional transport, and people in regional areas [bear] a considerably higher cost to transport,"" Mr Simons said. ""The cost, proportionately for a flight, is a lot more than it is between capital cities. ""Bus transport is more; the cost of fuel and the distances being travelled is more. ""It all has a non-direct financial impact and burden on costs to the region."" Mr Simons said access to hospitals and general practice was a common concern related to the public transport shortage. ""If your car doesn't start, you're really limited in terms of transport options and connections to health services,"" he said. Mr Simons said there was ""certainly a general groundswell for the return of rail to Mildura"". ""The recommendations [to progress passenger rail] were engagement with other councils lobbying the state government, revisiting previous studies, and garnering that support for the ongoing investigations,"" he said. ""But from just an economic perspective, the return of rail is going to be a costly exercise. ""Any ongoing discussion and conversation with the [Victorian] Department [of Transport], and any further analysis can't just be centred on the economic argument."" The report stated further work was required to document the ""real level of support for the return of passenger rail … quantify the most likely level of demand for a train service, and to extend previous feasibility studies to properly consider the social equity benefits"". The report was compiled for Mildura Rural City Council (MRCC). Within its comments, a spokesperson for Victoria's Department of Transport expressed support for studies into a passenger train's social benefits. Mildura is Victoria's largest population centre without a passenger train. Mildura residents currently face travel times of up to nine hours one way to get to Melbourne via public transport, a journey involving transferring from train to bus and travelling via Swan Hill, Ballarat or Bendigo. There are up to eight plane flights a day between Mildura and Melbourne, which take just over an hour one way but cost three times more than trains and coaches combined. Aside from passenger rail, the study also recommended a review into bus services linking towns in north-west Victoria, and that MRCC review the town bus network alongside the Department of Transport and bus operators to determine possible improvements. Those improvements could be more services, upgraded bus terminals, and the introduction of more on-demand transport services. Residents are encouraged to provide their feedback to the study by Friday, June 10.

Almost six months on Ms Paola, who was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome in 2008, has found a ""second-home"" at the cafe and her social skills ""are up"". Where is My Coffee? is run by the not-for-profit organisation VMCH (Villa Maria Catholic Homes) and is a learning hub and employment pathway for clients under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The trainees are involved in running the cafe, including customer service, handling money, preparing food and drinks, and cleaning. The cafe has recently reached a milestone with some of its trainees now actively looking for paid work. Cafe coordinator Jodie Long said traineeships were usually completed over six to 12 months. ""We assess trainees after six months to see where they are going and then we help them gain employment when they are ready,"" she said. Ms Long said two trainees had prepared their resumes and referees and were in contact with potential employers. Ms Paola said she had learnt the ins and outs of the hospitality industry and was confident she would find paid employment in the near future. She admitted she had come a long way in a short amount of time. ""I had never been in the workforce before, and I have made new friends here which is good for me because I had trouble making friends,"" she said. ""I used to get scared talking to people around my age, but now I've made friends my own age. It's really, really good."" Ms Paola said she now had the confidence to talk to customers and tell them stories. ""The locals know who you are and you chat with them, and it is really lovely,"" she said. Ms Long said watching trainees grow their independence and confidence on the path to being job-ready was inspiring. ""We have clients that are travelling independently to work when six months ago they were chaperoned,"" she said. ""We could not get them to communicate. A couple of participants would hide out the back and some didn't make eye contact. ""Now they are talking to customers without us prompting them, even singing on the job ... they've taken big steps as they move on to seek employment.""

37,Warnings of cost blowouts for 'Australia's longest tunnel' ,business,"  Questions hang over funding for major Great Western Highway tunnel through Blue Mountains Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The New South Wales government is accused of jumping the gun by announcing Australia's longest road tunnel through the Blue Mountains without locking in all the funding. The state opposition and some residents in the Hartley Valley have questioned where the money would come from. The state government projected the entire 34km upgrade, including the 11km underground stretch from Blackheath to Little Hartley, would cost $8 billion. It committed $2.5 billion for the project, and the Commonwealth has locked in $2 billion, but its share is not to be used for the underground section. That means $3.5 billion towards the cost of the works is currently not accounted for and there is no firm price tag on the toll-free tunnel. The ABC has sought clarification on what portion of the bill either level of government would stump up, after the Minister for Regional Roads and Transport Sam Farraway, and Deputy Premier Paul Toole, locked in the multi-billion dollar works on Sunday. Shadow roads minister John Graham said it came at a time when cuts to other projects were taking place, ahead of the 2023-24 budget. ""Due to rising cost pressures on the transport side of the budget some of the projects which have been promised across the state will be slowed down,"" Mr Graham said. He said that included Parramatta Light Rail Stage 2, Sydney Metro Southwest and the Beaches Link. ""At the same time to have another big promise — the longest tunnel we've seen in NSW — without funding clarity, it really leaves a question mark about how serious this promise is and whether it'll be delivered and when it'll be delivered,"" he said. ""A lot of these big projects are announced far earlier than they're ever planned or built and this project risks being in the same category. The test for that will be in the budget."" Mr Graham expected the project to blow out beyond the $8 billion budgeted due to the difficult nature of long tunnelling work through sensitive heritage and wilderness areas. The design would see engineers dig about 100m under Mt Victoria and 30m under Blackheath. ""I can guarantee this will be a very expensive project,"" he said. ""From the people I've spoken to in the construction industry, I don't believe that the government's forecast is very credible."" The community of Medlow Bath has also called for the tunnel to be 19km, starting at Katoomba, an option which the Member for Macquarie Susan Templeman wants considered. The tunnel plan concerns some residents of the Hartley Valley who fear there is a lack of ventilation planning for the infrastructure, which could result in pollution sitting among the historic landscape. Treasurer of the Hartley District Progress Association Ramsay Moody described the project as being a ""disaster"" for the area. ""One of the major issues of course is the flow of exhaust gases into the Hartley Valley, particularly from the westbound tunnel,"" Mr Moody said. ""That's the big concern, that it will impact on people's health."" Work to formalise the design of the tunnel is still underway and the Environment Impact Statement is being prepared. ""It's got a lot of environmental issues associated with it that have still got to come out into the public domain,"" he said. ""It's totally unfunded at this stage so it's got a long way to go yet."" In a statement, Transport for NSW Director West Alistair Lunn said the tunnel ""is going to transform travel between the east and the west, reduce congestion and improve safety for residents, tourists and our freight industry"". It is estimated the tunnel could reduce travel time by up to 30 minutes. Mr Lunn said air quality and human health were priorities when designing tunnels and the team was working with the NSW Chief Scientist and Chief Health Officer. The ABC contacted Deputy Premier Paul Toole and federal Minister for  Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development for comment. Construction on the tunnel is set to commence in 2024 and finish by 2027.

38,NSW Now: Man accused of killing Charlise Mutten hit with more charges,business,"  Sydney news: Man accused of killing Charlise Mutten hit with more charges Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Here's what you need to know this morning. A NSW healthcare union says it hopes the legalisation of voluntary assisted dying will highlight the need for palliative care funding. Voluntary assisted dying was legalised in NSW on Thursday, making it the last state in Australia to allow terminally ill adults to choose to end their lives. The Nurses and Midwives Association commended the move but general-secretary Brett Holmes said it must be backed by funding. ""There is a lack of resources for palliative care across the health system and particularly across regional and remote New South Wales,"" he said. ""We continue to call on the government to increase nurse-to-patient ratios so that nurses can deliver the care to those palliative patients as well."" It will take up to 18 months for the laws to come into effect. A man accused of killing his fiancee's daughter while on holiday in the Blue Mountains has been charged with further offences, including possessing child abuse material. Justin Stein, 31, who was charged with Charlise Mutton's murder, is due to appear at Penrith Court today. On Thursday, officers visited Mr Stein at Silverwater Jail, before charging him with two counts of possessing an unregistered firearm, two counts of possessing an unauthorised firearm, possessing ammunition without a licence and committing an aggravated break and enter in company. He was also charged with possessing child abuse material, unrelated to the murder investigation. Charlise was on a holiday with her mother and Mr Stein at his family's Mt Wilson property, when she was reported missing on January 14. The nine-year-old was found near the Colo River four days later. Mr Stein was arrested at Surry Hills that afternoon and charged with her murder. Police have confirmed they have found guns and ammunition in bushland near the property in February. Australia could learn from Scotland's approach to tackling soaring house prices and rental shortages, housing policy expert Hal Pawson says. The UK country wants to build 110,000 affordable homes by 2032, with the majority for social rent and in neighbourhoods where residents can meet their day-to-day needs within a 20-minute walk. Professor Pawson, from the University of New South Wales, said Scotland's costed targets were in contrast to NSW's strategy. ""It properly defines the problems it seeks to address and it proposes remedial actions that seem to address those problems,"" he said. ""The remedial actions are costed and that's an absolutely crucial thing. Now the NSW so-called housing strategy doesn't do any of those things."" Scotland's Cabinet Secretary for Housing, Shona Robison, said their plan would also create 15,000 jobs. ""To make sure everyone has a warm, affordable home to live in, whether that's rental or low-cost home ownership,"" she said. ""The spin-off benefits from that is that we can also link in our net-zero ambitions to make those homes more affordable in terms of the running costs of them."" The ABC has contacted NSW Housing Minister Anthony Roberts for comment. New South Wales District Court Judge Peter Zahra, who died suddenly in early May, will be honoured at a funeral in Sydney today. The 66-year-old suffered a stroke just days after overseeing the start of the fraud trial of the former manager of Australian musician Guy Sebastian. Throughout his career he presided over a number of high-profile cases, including the trial of Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes and disgraced former Auburn deputy mayor Salim Mehajer. His death was followed by an outpouring of tributes from politicians and members of the legal community. The funeral will be held at St Mary's Cathedral this morning and will delay the start time of several high-profile trials including that of actor Craig McLachlan and former teacher Chris Dawson. A new fleet of intercity trains could finally be rolled out in New South Wales, after a lengthy stand-off between unions and the state government. The Rail, Tram and Bus Union has been lobbying the government for changes to the $2 billion fleet of trains to improve safety. They were meant to be operational in 2019. Last week, Industrial Relations Minister Damien Tudehope demanded the fleet be rolled out without any more delay. But on Thursday, Minister for Transport David Elliott agreed to take a proposal to cabinet on modifications to the fleet. Rail unions had agreed not to take industrial action for the past six weeks while they negotiated with the government over pay and conditions. Showers.

39,"What caused America's baby formula crisis, and how will they feed 'starving' babies who need it?",business,"  Why is there a baby formula shortage in America? The supply chain and contamination calamity that left parents scrambling Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Like so many parents with young children, Raquel Robertson is exhausted. But she also feels a sense of helplessness as she struggles to find the baby formula she needs to feed her three-month-old daughter, Penelope. ""It's very discouraging as a parent, and makes me feel guilty,"" she said. ""Because you can't really do anything for your child."" Ms Robertson lives on a military base in California in the middle of the Mojave desert, where she says supplies can be limited at the best of times. However, a severe baby formula shortage in the United States has made life much more difficult. The new mother is driving up to 4 hours at a time to try to buy the specific type of product required by her daughter. ""Penelope is anaemic so it's extremely difficult to find something that helps the iron stick. And I'm also anaemic,"" she said. ""So breastfeeding, I wish that would be enough for them. But it's not, unfortunately. ""Having to find that specific formula right now is impossible. Finding substitutes is also very, very difficult because if it's not the exact one, it can always hurt the baby."" Supplies of baby formula first started to tighten across the US in the early stages of the pandemic, as a result of panic buying and supply chain challenges. But the problems were exacerbated in February when major manufacturer Abbott recalled several types of product and closed its Michigan plant in response to rare bacterial infections in four babies, two of whom died. It left a huge gap in the market which other producers could not quickly fill. Soon, parents in search of baby formula found empty shelves at supermarkets and pharmacies. ""Usually with baby formula, it is one of those products that is fairly stable in demand, it doesn't change much, there's no seasonality,"" said Rudi Leuschner, an associate professor at Rutgers Business School. ""So the supply chain was made to go with one speed and one speed only."" The Michigan plant was a large producer of specialty formulas, according to Steven Abrams, a professor of paediatrics at University of Texas as Austin's Dell Medical School. He said the shutdown further complicated the situation for parents of children with special dietary needs. ""There are a number of babies that have severe allergies or have special diseases where they can only get one type of formula,"" he said. ""And for those babies, because those formulas were particularly affected, it's been a real crisis."" Abbott says there is ""no conclusive evidence"" to link its formulas to the bacterial illnesses and it has now reached an agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to work towards reopening the plant. However, the company says it will take another six to eight weeks after production resumes for the formula to hit the shelves. About 98 per cent of the baby formula consumed in the US is produced domestically. But the shortage has prompted authorities to start looking elsewhere. Amid increasing political pressure to solve the crisis, President Joe Biden invoked the Defence Production Act to speed up local production. He has also launched what is known as 'Operation Fly Formula', using federal planes to pick up supplies from overseas. The FDA is temporarily relaxing its strict importation rules to make it easier to bring in baby formula, with a senior White House official pointing to Australia as a possible source. ""As we look at the kind of countries that have health and safety inspection systems similar to our own … we can imagine Australia, New Zealand, the UK also being countries that, you know, product could be imported from,"" they told a recent briefing. The government agency promoting Australian trade and investment, Austrade, said it was working with local producers to try to fast track their ability to fill demand. ""With world class baby formula products and a strong trading relationship under Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, Australia is doing what it can to help the US address its baby formula shortage,"" a spokesperson told the ABC. ""Australia is a global leader in quality baby formula products with world class safety and biosecurity standards."" Australian parents have previously complained of baby formula shortages caused by personal shoppers known as ""Daigou"" shipping tins to China, where a safety scandal more than a decade ago drove up demand for Australian-made products. Many families in the US are turning to social media to try to buy, sell and trade formula. While some posts celebrate other parents for going out of their way to help each other, alerts about scams and price gouging are also common. Ms Robertson has noticed tins that would normally sell for around $US30 ($43) being advertised for more than $US100. ""That's kind of greedy, knowing that these babies are starving, there's babies out here that need that,"" she said. Professor Abrams urged desperate parents against trying to make their own formula or diluting their existing supplies, saying it was ""flat out not safe."" And he warned other nations to learn from the US experience. ""I think every country probably needs to take this as a good opportunity to take a look at its supply chain,"" he said. ""And make sure that it's able to take a single formula company going down.""

40,"Welcome to a new kind of house, packed with features seldom seen before COVID-19",business," Science Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog ""The Barnaby"" might be a strange name for a home of the future, but that's what this four-bedroom demonstration house claims to be. Located in a small town in North Carolina, it's the size of an average new house in Australia and looks pretty normal from the outside. Inside, the differences are obvious: a front-door ""vestibule"" for no-contact home delivery, two ""pocket"" home offices (neither of which is a bedroom), a school room, a quarantine room, a ""secret room"" behind a bookcase (for being alone), and a whopping four bathrooms. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is a design shaped by the pandemic. The team of architects, social researchers, and marketing experts that dreamed it up say every detail is informed by insights from a survey into the impact of the pandemic on homes and communities in the US. What about in Australia? Here, the property industry is seeing demand for features like those of The Barnaby (though not four bathrooms). The dedicated home office is king, and there's generally greater appreciation for good design and quality of construction. COVID-19 shone a light on all the pre-existing problems with our housing and asked us to do more with our houses, including working from home (WFH). So, what does an ideal post-COVID Australian home look like? And will any actually get built? The Barnaby's design choices were informed by the America at Home study, which surveyed more than 6,000 US adults in 2020. There's a new commercial rush to automate our homes and appliances. Is this how we'll live in the future? It found that Millennials and Gen Xers wanted relatively uncommon features such as germ-resistant countertops and flooring, greater energy efficiency, more storage for food or water, touch-free taps, appliances and toilets, and space for more than one home office. ""Post-pandemic, people have realised their homes can do more and that better design matters,"" said Nancy Keenan, president and chief executive officer of Dahlin Group Architecture Planning, the California-based firm that helped design The Barnaby demonstration house. Key to making a home do more is something called ""the flex space"", or a room with multiple potential uses. What this boils down to is an open-plan living room and kitchen, and then lots of ""acoustically secure"" (ie. decently soundproofed) medium-sized rooms that could be home offices, bedrooms, media rooms, and the like. Along with this, there's a scattering of tiny ""pocket flex spaces"" that could be used as smaller studies or walk-in wardrobes. The idea is that a whole family (The Barnaby was designed for a Millennial couple with two young children, where one parent works from home) can use the one house for lots of different things, all at the same time. ""Providing spaces in the home that can be used in many ways is key to a successful floor plan, especially when designing to smaller square footages,"" Ms Keenan said. ""Our clients are also exploring the viability of optioning flexible furniture systems and moveable walls to enhance space flexibility."" These trends can be seen in Australia. Every two years, property developer Mirvac surveys customers about what they're looking for in a house or an apartment. The most recent survey showed a clear shift in thinking, said Diana Sarcasmo, head of design at Mirvac, which has $26 billion worth of assets under management in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. ""Half the people we spoke to in the survey said they were looking for a hybrid working arrangement going forward,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. That change is reflected in demand for home offices. ""There's been a 20 per cent increase in people in apartments asking for a study. And in housing, there's double the number."" The surge in pet ownership during lockdowns means people are willing to pay extra for doggy doors and dog-wash facilities. And hours spent WFH has made people aware of ""sustainability upgrades"" like thermal insulation. In the short space of one year, Annabelle and Alex have slashed the money they spend on electricity, gas and petrol to zero. Here's how they did it. ""People have always wanted sustainability upgrades, but weren't willing to pay for them,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. ""Now 64 per cent say they're willing to pay extra. That's a massive shift over the last couple of years."" George Massoud, design director at Frasers Property, another large developer, agreed. He's also seen people placing greater value on ""things like quality of light, ventilation, and acoustics"". And the home office with a door you can close is here to stay. ""The mediocre study nook doesn't cut it anymore."" Of course, it's harder finding space for all this in an apartment. Since the onset of COVID-19, house values have out-performed those of units. And dwelling values (houses and units) in regional areas have increased much more than those in capital cities. Eliza Owen, head of research at CoreLogic Australia, said the need for space was a contributing factor. ""Larger, more spacious homes allowed for a home office, and larger properties in regional Australia even allowed people to create their own oasis for entertainment and recreation amid the pandemic,"" she said. So are Australians ditching the inner-city apartment? No, Ms Sarcasmo says. ""There was a feeling during the middle of the pandemic that people would be driven further out of the city,"" she said. ""But in the last several months, what we've seen is great demand for apartment projects, if they're well located with amenities."" Mr Massoud, agreed: the picture was more complicated than Australians buying large houses in regional areas. Size matters, but so does, increasingly, location. People want to live in urban environments that are within walking distance to parks, cafes, pubs, restaurants, and the like. One reason for this may be the rise of WFH: We're taking greater interest in our local community. ""In homes and the apartment space, people are really assessing what's beyond their four walls,"" Mr Massoud said. He also believes homes won't get much bigger. ""I don't see larger homes being a trend, but I do see major improvements in quality."" Though Australia doesn't yet have its own version of The Barnaby , architects are working at imagining how our houses and apartments might be better designed to suit our needs. In March this year, a Brisbane exhibition featured the work of 10 Australian architects who had been invited to develop new concepts of the home and residential environments. The designs included a much greater focus on community and connection, including shared amenities for apartments, as well as verandahs, walkways, and verge gardens to connect neighbours. The exhibition itself was the idea of the Architecture et Cetera Lab, formed by three Griffith University design academics and practising architects, Cecilia Bischeri, Zuzana Kovar and Jessica Blair. ""COVID put what we consider normality under scrutiny,"" Dr Bischeri said. ""Residential space is becoming a habitat, in the sense we are going to function 24/7 in this space. ""Houses need to accommodate all interests and activities that in a normal situation you would experience outside."" Residential architects have seen a big increase in demand for their services, said Shannon Battisson, national president of the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA). In Canberra, where she works, public servants have been spending money on their homes, rather than on overseas holidays. ""One of the big things COVID has done has made people think, 'Hey, we might spend a lot of time here in the future and it's worth doing it well.' ""We went from having a six-month waiting list for our projects, and then that blew out to two years."" What people want isn't the only factor that decides what gets built. Most new apartments, for instance, are built for investors rather than owner-occupiers, says Tom Alves, head of development at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. ""The shape and form of those apartments is not driven by need, but by global investment,"" he said. Houses are similar: Less than 6 per cent of new houses in Australia have architectural involvement. So far, COVID-19 hasn't had a big impact on the regulation determining the minimum standards for houses and units, Dr Alves said. The 2021 update to the Victorian Government's 2017 Better Apartment Design Standards addressed problems with poor acoustic and visual privacy, a lack of natural light, and an inflexible floor plan. Outlining the changes, the Victorian Government website states: ""More than ever, the coronavirus pandemic has shown us that all homes need to have access to air, nature, sunlight and personal space."" Other states and territories have not updated their apartment design standards since the outbreak of COVID-19. The National Construction Code, which sets minimum performance and quality requirements for new housing in Australia, is in the process of being updated to ensure homes are better insulated and energy efficient (though this was set in train well before the pandemic). COVID-19 will change design in Australia, but it may not be as widespread as we might like, Ms Battisson said. ""I think we'll be quick to revert to our usual ways."" But there is one sign of hope, at least in her opinion: fewer people are asking for home theatres. ""We're really against things like home theatres — it's a room that's pretty big and dark and can't be used for anything else. ""In COVID, not a single person asked for a home theatre. ""I'm kind of hoping they won't come back strongly after the pandemic."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

41,"Q+A panel casts doubt on PM's ability to change 'bulldozer' ways, as both parties' economic policies called into question",business,"  Scott Morrison's promise of change rubbished by several Q+A panellists as Liberal senator says he'd rather see Labor in power than a hung parliament Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised to change and be less of a ""bulldozer"" should he be re-elected on Saturday but on Q+A on Thursday night, multiple panellists rubbished that claim. Mr Morrison has been labelled a ""liar"" by French President Emmanuel Macron and criticised in leaked comments by members of his own party, and his character was brought into question by audience member Brenda McGowan, who felt his interview on ABC's 7.30 with Leigh Sales on Monday night was further evidence he cannot change. Former independent member for Indi Cathy McGowan said she would ""love"" to see Mr Morrison change, especially on his treatment of women's issues and when it came to showing empathy. ""There's a huge amount of room for improvement in our government,"" Ms McGowan said. ""I just want what's best for Australia — and if Scott Morrison can get to this stage of the election and honestly say he hasn't been as good as he could have been, and he could have been better, I really welcome that."" Given the opportunity to defend his leader, Liberal senator James Paterson said issues that have been raised in Mr Morrison's term — including COVID, bushfires and floods — required swift decision-making and decisiveness but that he believed if re-elected, the PM could change his ways. ""Hopefully these are now peaceful and prosperous and conflict-free times and will require a different style of leadership,"" Senator Paterson said. ""I think that's what he was signalling. ""He ran a very tough and small government in times of crisis where decisions had to be made quickly, where you couldn't go through the normal consultation and careful consideration but had to make decisions on the fly."" Asked by Q+A host David Speers if that meant a ""kinder, gentler Scott Morrison"", Senator Paterson said he thought it would. That claim though was not bought into by either Labor Member for Macnamara in Victoria Josh Burns, or Peter Hartcher, the political editor for The Age and Sydney Morning Herald. Hartcher was particularly aggressive when it came to Mr Morrison's character and drew on religious parlance to take on Mr Morrison's promise of change. ""It looked like a deathbed conversion,"" Hartcher said of the PM's promise. ""Looking at electoral oblivion, he decided that he would have to change."" Asked if he thought Mr Morrison could change, Hartcher said no. ""I think you judge someone on their record,"" he said. ""James has said 'kindler and gentler' would be a better mode but the thing is that a leader has to respond to whatever circumstances present. ""In a major crisis, we could have done with more of 'Bulldozer' Morrison, with the bushfires and the floods, the country was calling out for Scott Morrison to take leadership in those crises and he didn't."" Mr Burns had it put to him that Labor had committed to character assassination of the PM but he held firm and said Labor had merely been able to capitalise on what others said. ""It hasn't been the Labor Party that's effectively made character assessments on Scott Morrison but members of the Liberal Party: Gladys Berejiklian, Malcolm Turnbull, even the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, said famously, 'I don't think — I know that he's a liar,'"" Mr Burns said. ""I think that there's been a long line of people wanting to make an assessment on his character. ""Going back to Brenda's question, I'd say this: He's not changing. ""This is as good as he's going to get. ""This guy has been a handbrake on climate action, a handbrake on an Integrity Commission."" The hits kept on coming for Mr Morrison as audience member Leah Sawell criticised the government's plan to allow Australians to access up to 40 per cent, capped at $50,000 of their superannuation to place a deposit on a house. The 35-year-old renter said she was in shock at the announcement as she suggested it showed  the PM to be out of touch with Australians on the cost of living. ""I was actually in shock about this announcement to withdraw $50,000 in order to buy a house,"" Ms Sawell told the panel. ""The hide of Scott Morrison to presume that I even have $50,000 in the first place ... he's so out of touch, especially with women's issues. ""After surviving domestic abuse and violence, and living on the below-poverty-rate of Centrelink in my 20s, I have less than $30,000 in my super."" She then asked Senator Paterson if he knew if any women were involved when the planned scheme was hatched. The senator said he sympathised with Ms Sawell before affirming that Minister for Superannuation Jane Hume was involved in formulating the policy, before defending it. ""I understand that this is not a policy that will work for everyone,"" he said. ""Some people will take it up and some people won't but part of your story was really interesting. ""You said you're paying more on rent than you would on a mortgage, for some people, it would help them if they could take money out of superannuation, that would get them the deposit they need to buy a house and pay lower mortgage repayments rather than higher rent. ""I accept it might not work for you and won't work for everyone, but for some people it's a game-changer."" While the Coalition came under fire for that policy, Labor was also questioned over their plans for spending after they unveiled costings that equated to $7.4 billion added to the budget deficit. Asked, given the rate of inflation, should we not be ""spending less""? Mr Burns responded by defending Labor's plans, especially to increase the minimum wage. ""We should have a wage rise for our minimum wage earners,"" he said. ""We're talking about people earning $20.33 an hour, these are people earning about the same in a week what the prime minister earns in about half a day. ""Our differences in costings are $7 billion over the forward estimates, which is pretty modest. ""It goes to productivity measures... investing in childcare so women and families can get back to work, making medicines cheaper so families can ensure that they get the medicines that they need."" Hartcher suggested that Labor, in announcing that level of spend, was being hypocritical. ""Labor, having been very critical of the government has now replicated it and added another $7 billion. ""Labor is just as irresponsible."" One interesting question going into the federal election is whether minor parties and independents will increase their vote enough to hold a balance of power or lead to a hung parliament. Ms McGowan who was elected as Independent Member for Indi in 2013 said she thought only three independents could win seats. She did not nominate those but said: ""One in Melbourne, I reckon, one in Sydney, and one in Perth,"" before she added that she believed many would place pressure on National Party MPs. ""There's a real movement in the country as well, in the National Party seats,"" she said. ""There's a number of National Party seats that are going to come really close, and I think, on election night, there's going to be a massive recount."" The notion was something that Senator Paterson bristled at as he made a surprising comment in support of Labor over people voting for independents. ""I think it's a vote for a weaker government and a weaker country, leading to uncertainty,"" he said. ""In uncertain times, that's the last thing we need. ""I want a strong majority government. Obviously I would prefer it be a Liberal/National one, but if it weren't, I would rather it be a Labor one than a weak hung parliament."" Pressed on his comments by Speers, Senator Paterson said he would of course prefer for the Coalition to remain in power but there be a majority government either way ""If Labor is successful, if they do provide the prime minister, I would rather that they're able to do so in their own right rather than relying on the crossbenchers.""

42,"Aged care homes don't need 'evidence' on food spending to receive government funding, with a third still spending less than $10 a day",business,"  Aged care homes don't need 'evidence' on food spending to receive government funding, with a third still spending less than $10 a day Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Aged care operators will receive an extra $3 billion in government funding to improve food, but have been told they do not need to provide ""spreadsheets or evidence"" of how much they are spending in order to get the cash. Instead, providers have to answer two questions each quarter regarding how much they spend on food prepared on and off-site. The first public report on the scheme shows that two-thirds of operators said they are spending on average $14 a day per resident on food while a third — or 883 operators – said they spent less than $10 a day. Two per cent of operators said they continued to spend less than $6 a day. But the providers do not require any proof of their spending, with the Department of Health telling providers: ""We are not asking you to provide us with spreadsheets or evidence that supports your answers. You are expected to keep a record of how you calculate the information you provide us."" ""I don't think without a clear audit trail, without the spreadsheets and so on, you can be fooled that they actually did spend the money on this,"" said Stephen Duckett, health economist and former secretary of the Department of Health. A spokesperson for Aged Care Minister Richard Colbeck said the mechanism to report spending on food will be expanded when the new aged care funding system is introduced. Celebrity chef Maggie Beer, whose foundation advocates for better food in aged care, said it was not possible to provide three meals and snacks for $10 a day. ""We have a responsibility to look after those in aged care, those that are no longer able to look after themselves in that way,"" she told the ABC's 7.30. ""To me, it's just totally unacceptable."" The government announced its plan to give an extra $10 per day, per resident in the 2021 Budget, just months after the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety's damning report into the sector. When the federal government increased its funding, it said it was to support ""aged care providers to deliver better care and services to residents, with a focus on food and nutrition"". Let us know if you have a story or issue you'd like us to look into. Email aged.care@abc.net.au to tell us your story. One of the royal commission's many criticisms of the federal government and the aged care sector was the lack of transparency on how taxpayer dollars were spent. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told 7.30's Leigh Sales on Budget night last year that the regulator, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, would make sure the extra money was spent on residents. ""We're putting hundreds of extra audits every year,"" he said. ""There's going to be new powers for the regulators, a more coordinated system to ensure that the money being spent is getting to the residents."" The Department of Health said the 883 aged care homes spending less than $10 a day had been referred to the regulator for monitoring. But 7.30 can reveal the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission audited 41 of the homes, or 5 per cent. It found three had failed food standards. A spokesperson for the regulator said: ""Decisions are still pending for some of the 41 services. ""Therefore, the number of decisions of non-compliance with this requirement may change."" Mr Duckett argues the regulator should have performed unannounced audits on all those facilities. ""We don't want our grannies and so on to be given awful food, and the government cannot guarantee us that that actually is no longer happening,"" Mr Duckett said. The CEO of Leading Age Services Australia, Sean Rooney, said the Basic Daily Fee in residential aged care is designed to cover the costs range of ""hotel services"", including meals and refreshments, laundry, cleaning, social activities, basic toiletries, and help in emergencies. He said figures showed that 60 per cent of aged care facilities were operating at a loss. The Department of Health said it would not be releasing the next two Food and Nutrition reports of providers until after the end of the financial year. Staff, dieticians and families around the country have sent photos to the ABC showing that after the funding increase, food has not improved in their nursing homes. Dietician Anne Shneyder from Nutrition Professionals Australia said she is still seeing the same problems that she saw more than 20 years ago. ""I see things like … the evening meal, where cheaper or low-protein items are served,"" she said. ""Things like little pies and pasties, things like fish patties with not much fish in them … dim sims, tinned spaghetti."" Julia Davis, whose mother Barbara was a resident at Castlemaine Health in Victoria before she died earlier this year, had relocated so she could be close to her mum and cook meals to take to her. Ms Davis felt that the food her mother was receiving was so poor in quality that ""[mother] would have starved"" if she hadn't been there. She said she did not see any improvement in food when the supplement came in and despite her complaints, the regulator found the nursing home passed all food standards. Castlemaine Health said the regulator found that ""most consumers enjoyed the food"" and that it was a suitable quantity and quality, however it declined to say how much it spent per day. To improve food quality in nursing homes, in 2019 the federal government gave a grant from a dementia fund totalling almost $600,000 to the Maggie Beer Foundation to produce a series of online training videos for chefs and cooks in the sector. Last month, the foundation released the online training videos, which many in the industry believed would be available free of charge. Instead, 11 modules cost about $480 – or $44 per half-hour video. Mr Duckett said he thinks most Australians were under the impression that all aged care homes would be able to benefit. ""Not every residential aged care facility is going to participate because some are very small and can't afford these things, even if it's a small price,"" he said. ""So I think, unfortunately, what I think the public thought was going to help everybody is probably not actually what the business model is."" Maggie Beer said the foundation received only a portion of the money, which paid for a moderator for an online forum available to those who completed the training modules. She said the majority of the money would go to Altura Learning, who produced the videos. ""I would love to think that we had the support to make them free to everyone in aged care, but we have to deal with the economic issues of Altura's business,"" she said. Altura Learning is owned by aged care provider Bolton Clarke, and told 7.30 it charges a small fee to stream and host the lessons. Other dieticians and chefs in the sector have also raised concerns that the online videos are too advanced for cooks working in aged care who have no training. They say some of the ingredients are not readily available or too expensive. ""I think the videos are fantastic for somebody who is really trying very hard already to do a good job and would like to further improve their practice,"" Ms Shneyder said. ""But I think there's also that need for some more fundamental training for staff who may have very few skills."" Maggie Beer disagrees. ""Following the online modules will give the cook or the chef the basic skills,"" she said. ""Some of the ingredients are optional. For instance, if you're making a fish soup, and we have saffron in it, saffron is optional. ""There are people and there are homes where food is so important. They don't want it dumbed down. ""And I don't want anything dumbed down, but I want everything accessible."" In 2020, the Maggie Beer Foundation received another grant from the Department of Health of almost $300,000 for a two-day national congress on aged care food, nutrition, and the dining experience. Aged care worker Glen O'Driscoll says staff are overworked and worn out. The Coalition has promised billions since the royal commission, but Labor is making aged care an election issue. Labor has also pledged to invest $5 million through the iconic chef's foundation to develop new food standards and more training programs for chefs. Mr Duckett said enlisting Maggie Beer to the cause made Australians believe food standards in aged care had improved. ""She has a tremendous reputation, and I think the Maggie Beer Foundation saying it's going to do this actually gives the government a lot of credibility, and I think that's what they want,"" he said. ""The public thought it was going to fix everything and I think the government traded on that and was not as clear with what they're actually doing.""

43,Researchers say coal-to-hydrogen project's lower emissions claims 'misleading',business,"  Australia Institute disputes Victorian coal-to-hydrogen emissions claims Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog New research has found a project using Victorian brown coal to make hydrogen is unlikely to meet its claimed emission reductions. The Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project aims to test if it is possible to produce hydrogen from coal for export. The first shipment of liquefied hydrogen created from coal mined at the Loy Yang brown coal mine in the Latrobe Valley was shipped to Japan this year. A consortium of Japanese and Australian companies, including Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Japanese energy giant J-Power and AGL, which owns Loy Yang, are behind the pilot. But to reach commercialisation stage the consortium will rely on carbon capture storage to lower emissions and make it carbon neutral. The consortium plans to use the Victorian government's Carbon Net, which is still in development phase. The federal and Victorian governments have provided more than $50 million toward the supply chain pilot. Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor and the consortium said the project would reduce emissions by 1.8 million tonnes a year if it reached commercialisation. They said that would be equivalent of emissions from 350,000 petrol cars. Independent public policy think tank the Australia Institute says it has obtained freedom of information documents that reveal this emission claim is misleading as it compared the project with other hydrogen gas projects, which didn't use carbon capture storage. Australia Institute emerging climate and energy program director Richie Merzian said the supply chain project would add between 2.9 and 3.8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions if it was compared with renewable hydrogen production, without carbon capture storage. He said that was equivalent to adding 550,000 to 735,000 petrol cars to the road. ""Those numbers make incorrect comparisons (so) it seems like this project will reduce emissions when we know it will actually increase,"" he said. ""You should be comparing it to a zero-emission hydrogen alternative,"" he said. However a spokesperson for the Coalition government said the coal hydrogen emission reduction estimate, including carbon capture storage technology, was reached using figures from the International Energy Agency and the CSIRO. ""Both the International Energy Agency and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have recognised carbon capture and storage technologies as being crucial to meeting global emissions reduction targets,"" the Coalition campaign headquarters spokesman said. Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain consortium spokesman Jeremy Stone said the Australia Institute's analysis was ""factually incorrect"" because they were assuming carbon capture storage would not be part of the project. ""Our calculations on carbon reductions ... is about what will happen when Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain proceeds with carbon capture and storage,"" he said. ""We have now produced pure hydrogen through gasification of a mix of biomass and coal, providing us with the potential of commercially producing carbon neutral and maybe carbon negative hydrogen (when combined with carbon capture storage)."" Mr Merzian said the supply chain trial should not be labelled as ""clean hydrogen"" because carbon capture storage had been a ""colossal failure"". Carbon capture storage involves capturing carbon dioxide at the site of production then pumping it deep underground where it can migrate into porous substrate, such as sandstone, and be trapped. ""The reason why we still talk about carbon capture and storage is because fossil fuel companies wanted it as a marketing tool to pretend they can clean up their act and continue to expand their footprint,"" Mr Merzian said. The Coalition government spokesperson said there were 29 commercial carbon capture storage facilities operating globally and more than 100 projects were in various stages of development. Esso Australia, which has oil and gas operations off Victoria's coast, was recently given about $40 million in federal government grants for its South East Australia Carbon Capture and Storage Hubs project. Esso was contacted for comment. ""The only way we'll get these technologies to maturity is by making sensible investments in their development and deployment,"" the Coalition spokesperson said. The Australia Institute also released polling revealing many people were confused by the term ""clean hydrogen"". Only one fifth the 1007 people polled knew its correct definition, which was set by the federal government and used hydrogen made using fossil fuels and carbon capture storage or with renewable energy. The polling showed 42 per cent in the survey thought ""clean hydrogen"" was limited to hydrogen using renewables, a zero emissions process. ""The polling shows that people don't know what clean hydrogen is, (so we) need to ditch that term and just call things as they are,"" Mr Merzian said.

44,AACo's beef boom sees 'strongest net profit result since listing on the ASX',business," ABC Rural Australia's largest cattle company AACo doubles operating profit, posts significant rise in herd Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australia's largest cattle company has posted an operating profit of $49.9 million for the 2021/22 financial year, more than double the previous year's result. Its statutory net profit after tax has also risen by a hefty $91 million. Speaking to investors this morning, CEO of the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo), Hugh Killen, said the ""excellent set of results"" was down to the company's strategy, improved performance of its beef brands, ""and our drive to make AACo a simpler and more efficient business"". ""Overall our bottom line statutory net profit after tax increased by $91 million to $136.9 million. This is our strongest net profit result since listing on the ASX,"" he said. Asia remains a key customer for AACo, but it was the growth in the North American market which had Mr Killen excited. ""We've had a great year in North America with our branded meat sales increasing by 56 per cent. This has come off the back of price and volume increases driven by the return to food service,"" Mr Killen said. ""We laid the groundwork for this growth during COVID … and the US will remain a key strategic market for AACo in FY23."" AACo's Wagyu meat sales, in terms of price per kilo, has risen 21 per cent over the last 12 months to $18.74/kg. Australia's cattle herd is rebuilding after years of drought and the same story is unfolding for AACo. Its herd size has increased 12.4 per cent over 12 months to around 382,000 head — an increase of around 42,000 head. The value of the herd has increased by an incredible $198.8 million and the value of its vast property portfolio has jumped $254.5 million. ""This has helped to drive (AACo's) net assets to $1.36 billion,"" Mr Killen said. Everything seems on the up for AACo, but shareholders once again will not see a dividend. When asked about potential dividends during an investor briefing, Mr Killen said AACo was focused on investing back into the company. ""We want to continue to invest back into the business, we'll continue to invest back into operations, and it's one of the reasons we've seen very good uplift in the valuation of our properties,"" he said. ""I believe the work we've done at AACo to make the company significantly more efficient and simpler will place us in a very strong position when seasonal conditions change in the future. ""The dividend question is ultimately for the board and I know the chairman is looking forward to updating everyone at the annual general meeting.""

45,'Insane' stress of cost of living sparks concern for young people in regional Victoria,business,"  Cost of living hits young regional Victorians hard ahead of federal election Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Community service organisations in Victoria are worried that the rising cost of living and housing affordability will see a new demographic of residents needing support. Echuca Neighbourhood House coordinator Sarah Peake is concerned by the number of young people and families seeking help amid the housing boom. ""We're providing food relief and we thought we knew what busy was [during lockdowns],"" she said. ""But then we saw the housing prices go up, rental prices go up and the whole housing market has exploded. ""We've had all these younger people go out and purchase their first homes and I think those interest rates are going to wreak a bit of havoc. ""Houses aren't cheap up here and they haven't been cheap for a while."" Youth Affairs Council Victoria chief executive Katherine Ellis says many young people are ""just trying to get by"". ""I think everywhere young people are really concerned about the rising cost of living,"" she said. ""Young people in rural and regional areas have so much more on their plate as well, it's only adding to their distress and the challenges they're facing. ""I think there's a real feeling amongst young people that the world is not equal for them right now. ""Young people are like anyone else in society — they're having to put petrol in their cars, buy groceries and they're part of families that are having to do those things. ""At the same time, nobody's getting any payrises and in fact, a lot of people are surviving on really low incomes. ""There are a lot of things on young people's minds and cost of living is definitely hitting them right where it hurts."" Ms Peake said housing was a major issue for young families. ""We had a young couple turn up — a mum and dad with three kids who were long-time renters and they're now couch surfing with their children out at Boort, which is over an hour away from here,"" she said. ""The dad lost his job because of the pandemic and they were struggling with the fact they were staying at a Boort and trying to drive into town. ""They actually came here for food relief, and then wanted to know if I could give any suggestions on emergency accommodation or where they could go. ""It's just insane — the stories I can tell you of what we've seen and witnessed here is people under massive strain. ""I just don't see it changing anytime soon."" Haven; Home, Safe general manager for support services north Donna Gillard says there is only access to one hotel and one motel in Echuca. During peak tourism times she says there are ""zero options"" for accommodation. ""Understandably, it's a business for these providers, so they choose tourism over some of our clients,"" she said. ""They also can't offer long-term accommodation or even medium-term accommodation."" Ms Gillard said the housing boom was also influencing who needed emergency accommodation and housing assistance. ""People … are having notices to vacate because investment properties have been sold,"" she said. ""We're also starting to see people who are presenting for rental arrears because they've had a rent increase, but the rent increase has gone beyond their affordability. ""They're now in that position where they have a house but it's not affordable, so they're at risk of homelessness.""

46,'No spare capacity': Hiring shudders to a halt as unemployment drops below 4 per cent,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australia's unemployment rate has fallen to 3.9 per cent, even though only 4,000 new jobs were created in April. It is the first time in the history of the monthly unemployment data — which goes back to 1978 — that the jobless rate has fallen below 4 per cent (when rounded to one decimal place). ""The last time the unemployment rate was lower than this was in August 1974, when the survey was quarterly,"" noted Bjorn Jarvis, who heads labour statistics for the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). A revision to the March figures means the drop to 3.9 actually occurred then, when unemployment was originally recorded at 4 per cent. The ABS figures show workforce participation eased slightly to 66.3 per cent, driving most of the decline in unemployment. In better news, the underemployment rate fell again from 6.3 to 6.1 per cent, which is the lowest underemployment rate since September 2008, as the global financial crisis was just starting to buffet Australia. ""There were actually 92,000 full-time jobs created and 88,000 part-time jobs lost,"" NAB economist Ivan Colhoun told ABC News Channel. ""So people switched to working more hours, so you could say that was good."" Tarsh Soxsmith has taken advantage of the strong jobs market to get better pay and more flexible conditions. Here's how you might be able to too. Hours worked also jumped 1.3 per cent last month, reflecting not only a decline in underemployment but also the easing of flood conditions in Queensland and New South Wales last month. ""The number of people working fewer hours than usual due to bad weather dropped from its March peak of over 500,000 to around 70,000 people in April,"" Mr Jarvis observed. However, the number of people working reduced hours due to illness continued to remain unusually high, reflecting ongoing disruptions caused by the Omicron variant of COVID-19. ""Around 740,000 people worked reduced hours in April because of illness, almost double what we usually saw in April before the pandemic,"" Mr Jarvis noted. ""Of these people, around 340,000 worked no hours, which was around triple what we would usually see."" KPMG senior economist Sarah Hunter said the combination of weak jobs growth and rising hours worked indicate that there are simply very few suitably qualified workers left without a job. ""The economy is now effectively operating with no spare capacity,"" Dr Hunter argued. ""Despite job adverts remaining at record highs and a higher-than-average proportion of businesses looking to bring people on, employment increased by just 4,000 over the month. ""Firms are partially compensating for the lack of employees by increasing hours worked. When there's an information vacuum, be wary of people who rush to fill it, writes Gareth Hutchens. ""This has pushed the underemployment rate down to 6.1 per cent, but labour shortages have become a binding constraint in many sectors."" Dr Hunter said this should mean workers soon start seeing bigger pay rises as employers compete for their services. ""Given the continued strength in demand and limited additional domestic supply of workers (including the slow recovery in inward migration), it is likely that wages growth will accelerate from here,"" she added. Brennen Stewart Allison is the head chef and manager at the Beach Hotel in Burnie, which sits within the marginal north-west Tasmanian seat of Braddon. The pub has gone back to paying staff double time to get them to work on Sundays. But, despite the extra incentives on offer, Mr Stewart Allison said it was still tough to find workers. ""It's quite hard to find staff at the moment. That's probably the biggest issue,"" he told The Business. ""Pre-COVID, we'd have 100 people apply for a job, where at the moment we're only getting five."" He wants the next government to invest in local training and get the long-term unemployed back to work. ""Let's push back against people that don't want to work and give them the chance, the training and the opportunity to get into the workforce,"" he said, adding, ""but not make it so easy for them so that they can sit at home."" Larry De'Corso is one of the people who has recently secured a new job. The Master of Social Work graduate was accepted into Headspace's early careers program after a few daunting months of looking for work last year. ""Yeah, to be honest, it was quite a stressful experience,"" they said. ""I feel really fortunate for having landed this role. Preventative mental health is such an important area."" Unemployment is falling quickly, but many people are still locked out of the labour market. As the job market tightens further, Larry De'Corso is feeling optimistic about their future employment prospects. ""In the field that I graduated from, there's such a high demand at the moment, it does look pretty positive,"" they said. ""But I don't think that's the case across the board. I think job security is hugely important and a real concern for a lot of people my age."" Despite rising to 8.8 per cent, seasonally adjusted, the youth unemployment rate (for people aged 15-24) is still sitting around levels last seen just before the global financial crisis.

47,"After flooding and lease cancellations, what comes next for Toombul Shopping Centre?",business,"  Mirvac will eye major redevelopment after leases cancelled at flooded Toombul Shopping Centre, observers say Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A redevelopment of the flood-ravaged Toombul Shopping Centre site will capitalise on its proximity to the Brisbane CBD, airport and transport links, business and marketing leaders say. Owner Mirvac announced on yesterday that it would be terminating retail leases at the north Brisbane retail centre after flooding in late February causing extensive damage. In a statement, the developer said it had ""undertaken extensive assessments to understand the full impact of the flood damage at Toombul shopping centre"". ""After taking into account the current and potential future impacts of flooding on the site, it is impractical and undesirable to reinstate the centre to how it was prior to the flooding damage,"" the statement said. ""We are now assessing the future of the site recognising the importance of the continued provision of retail for this local community."" CM Ink director Catherine Michael said the decision to close the 54-year-old centre was ""always coming"". The marketing consultant said the value of the site and the age of the shopping centre meant Mirvac could benefit greatly from its redevelopment. ""Mirvac paid $228 million for that site in 2016, and the valuations of a lot of shopping centres spaces and those kind of sites have gone through the roof, even with COVID and people not going inside centres as much,"" Ms Michael said. ""It's one of those centres – it's not a Chermside, which has the car parks, has everything that opens and shuts – it was easy to get into and out of, close to a train station and buses. ""That's going to be the key to its next life — transport-oriented development. ""It's well located and has those [transport] feeders into there."" But retailers requiring large geographical footprints like Bunnings would probably not be eyeing the location, Ms Michael said. She said those businesses would have already mapped out their ideal sites. Ms Michael said combining retail and residential could be an option. ""They will be looking at what's the best use for that location for shareholders — but that community now with property prices, it's not an outer suburb,"" she said. ""Nundah isn't that far from the city, it's not far from the airport, it's got good feeder links with rail and buses. ""They'll look to do something quite clever and offer something that [Westfield] Chermside isn't. ""We've become highly dependent on cars, so parking is critical."" Brisbane North Chamber of Commerce president Simon Penrose said he expected a multi-use development. ""There may still be a lot of retail, but a lot of places are going for residential as well,"" he said. ""I haven't heard anything about what's likely, but that's certainly what's been going on in other developments."" Many businesses that were located at Toombul would have to ""start all over again from scratch"", Mr Penrose said. While there were vacant shops in the adjacent suburbs of Nundah, Stafford and Lutwyche, he said many residents would be inconvenienced because the Toombul centre was ""a hub of the local area"". ""It was one of the only shopping centres which had a lot of banks in there,"" he said. ""It was very much a community shopping centre. ""A lot of [the shoppers] will be going across to Chermside — that was evidenced the last couple of weekends when it took an hour to get out of the shopping centre."" Some retailers had already moved to new locations after the centre closed. Toombul Barber is now in Ascot, Ed's PCs in Taigum, Home & Her is in Nundah and the Function Well gym is operating in Newstead. Mr Penrose and Ms Michael also agreed that whatever was planned for the Toombul site would need to be heavily flood-proofed. Mr Penrose said shopping centres in Gympie were now built up high, with the first two levels being car parks. Once you're aware of the risks from disasters, you can plan for them — and it can help mitigate some of the impacts. Ms Michael said using the model of old Queenslander homes, which were also built high off the ground, would be wise. ""Things could go underneath them, you could hose them out — that flipping of things that require rent, trading, customers, safety, really good sanitation [and which] need to be up high in these flood zones,"" she said. ""A lot of these centres, it's not home, it's not work — it's the third space. It's the old town square. ""Retail provides a lot of that community — people do their walking and meet for a coffee there, it's knowing when a JP would be there, it's the newsagent, it's the daily things people would require regularly in their weeks."" On the other side of Brisbane, Bunnings regional operations manager Jason Doyle confirmed the Oxley hardware store would remain closed while ""redevelopment opportunities, including flood-proof design concepts"" were explored. But he said Bunnings would reopen its flood-hit Rocklea store by mid-June. ""For now, our Oxley team will continue to work at and support their nearby stores, as they have been over the past two-and-a-half months,"" Mr Doyle said. ""We'll continue to keep the local community updated as our plans for reopening the Rocklea store progress, and once we have further updates for our Oxley store.""

48,Iconic South Australian wine brand Penfolds to launch 'made in China' vintage in effort to skirt Chinese tariffs,business,"  Iconic South Australian wine brand Penfolds to launch 'made in China' vintage in effort to skirt Chinese tariffs Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Iconic South Australian wine brand Penfolds has announced plans to circumvent steep Chinese tariffs on Australian wine by producing a wine made in China itself. Penfolds parent company Treasury Wine Estates (TWE) will release its first ""made in China"" vintage to the domestic market later this year. The company said it had found ""promising characteristics"" in grapes sourced from Ningxia, in China's central-north, and Shangri-la in the south-western Yunnan province. Chief Executive Officer Tim Ford said the move represented Treasury Wine's ""commitment to China."" ""China is an emerging fine winemaking region and we're confident we can produce a premium Chinese Penfolds that maintains the distinctive Penfolds house style and uncompromising quality,"" he said. ""As a leading global wine producer, we have a responsibility to help build the wine category and industry in our different markets."" TWE added it had entered into a ""strategic co-operation agreement"" with the China Alcoholic Drinks Association, the country's primary wine industry body, which would allow it to build China's ""fast-growing wine industry capability."" China's so-called ""anti-dumping"" tariffs imposed on Australian wine exporters in 2020 have devastated the market. The yearly value of Australia's wine industry has shrunk from $1.26 billion a year to $82 million. Chief Executive of Australian Grape and Wine Tony Battaglene welcomed Treasury Wine's move as ""a way to keep Australia's presence in the market."" ""I'm not really surprised. Most of our companies are going through a really difficult time because of the closure of the Chinese market so everyone is trying to diversify their supply chains,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""Penfolds is an iconic brand that's associated with Australia. Even if they're using Chinese wine, it will help Australia."" However, Mr Battaglene did have reservations about the quality of the wine. ""China is a really difficult place to grow grapes and make good wine,"" he said. ""In general, most of the quality is at lower price points… so it's not of the quality of a Penfolds. Having said that, there's a couple of areas where you get small quantities of very high-quality wine. Treasury Wines said China is tipped to become the world's second-largest wine market by next year, with an estimated 52 million regular wine drinkers. In 2021, Chinese consumers drank more than one billion litres of wine. Mr Battaglene said while Australian wines are held at a premium in China, there is also an appetite for local products. ""Chinese consumers want to know that what they buy is what they get, so I think the strength of the Penfolds brand will drive the integrity home,"" he said. He added other Australian wine producers with the resources would likely follow Penfolds' lead by expanding into the Chinese market. ""What we want the Chinese consumer to know is that one day we'll be back in China, and they can still drink Australian wine. We know they still want to.""

49,"Nick has been evicted twice from rentals, as landlords chase higher returns through short-term leases",business,"  Rental crisis caused by short-stay businesses leaving NSW tenants evicted and homeless Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Nick Crowley and his dog Barney have become good at packing up their worldly belongings and moving. As a renter at Orange in central west New South Wales, he has had to do it twice in just over a year because the owners wanted to lease the homes to companies to charge higher rent. ""If they're getting offered double the amount to rent, then they'd be mad not to take it, but from my perspective it was a bit of a bugger,"" Mr Crowley said. ""It was a bit frustrating having to pack up again about four months after I'd just unpacked everything."" His experience is not unique. The ABC has been told that many tenants across NSW had been given notice at their rental properties, with landlords wanting to either sell to capitalise on the housing market or flip their properties into short-term stays available through companies such as Airbnb and Stayz. Shoalhaven City Council (SCC) Mayor Amanda Findlay said she had seen a surge in the number of people in her south coast NSW community who could not find housing because rental properties were now being used for short-term lets. ""What I've noticed the most is that more and more homes are being bought for business purposes to be renting out on the short-term rental market,"" she said. SCC figures showed that more than one-third of the area's properties were owned by people who lived outside of the region. Ms Findlay said that figure rose to 80 per cent in local villages, which created other social problems. ""Because there are no people living [there] from Monday to Sunday, the services pack up and go because there's not a permanent population,"" she said. The NSW government has given councils the option to cap the number of days properties could be used for short-term accommodation. The Bega Valley Shire Council (BVSC) on the far south coast is one of them but has chosen not to impose any limit. The district has about 900 properties that would have qualified. ""It has very little effect and would only have made 15 per cent of those properties available at best if we'd had a 180-day cap,"" BVSC Mayor Russell Fitzpatrick said. ""It would have been more if it had been a 90-day cap."" Amanda Findlay said the cap on days would not provide secure, year-round housing. ""Some of the holiday homes may come into the market for a short period of time but that also has the downside for those already homeless, sleeping in appalling conditions,"" she said. A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Planning and Environment said its short-term rental accommodation policy balanced the positive economic impacts of holiday homes with the need to support local housing markets. The spokesperson said the policy regulated a previously unregulated industry. An Australian Short Term Rental Association spokesperson said data was needed to analyse the impact of short-term lets on the long-term rental market. He said this information was currently being compiled from regulations established by the NSW government. Both mayors said the NSW and federal governments needed to show greater leadership to limit the impact of short-term accommodation. Ms Findlay said the creation of zones for short-term stays within local government areas, and the introduction of bed taxes, could inject some regulation and balance into the market without significantly impacting tourism. ""What we also see is inaction from the state government and the federal government around, 'How do we get some tax out of that transaction to support these communities that need to make a change?',"" she said. Mr Fitzpatrick said the impact of short-term accommodation on the rental market was another reason governments needed to deliver more social and affordable housing. ""The problem is we need more places on the market,"" he said. ""We need them to be affordable at the rental price that people can afford to pay.""

50,European Union unveils 210 billion euro plan to ditch Russian fossil fuels,business,"  EU unveils 210 billion euro plan to ditch Russian fossil fuels, as the war in Ukraine puts pressure on energy supplies Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The European Commission has unveiled a 210 billion-euro plan for Europe to end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels by 2027, and to use the pivot away from Moscow to quicken its transition to green energy. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Europe's top gas supplier, has prompted the European Union to rethink its energy policies amid sharpened concerns of supply shocks. Russia supplies 40 per cent of the bloc's gas and 27 per cent of its imported oil, and EU countries are struggling to agree to sanctions on the latter. To wean countries off those fuels, Brussels proposed a three-pronged plan: a switch to import more non-Russian gas, a faster rollout of renewable energy, and more effort to save energy. The measures include a mix of EU laws, non-binding schemes, and recommendations to governments in the EU's 27 member countries, who are largely in charge of their national energy policies. Taken together, Brussels expects them to require 210 billion euros ($315 billion) in extra investments by 2027 and 300 billion euros by 2030 on top of those already needed to meet the bloc's 2030 climate target. Ultimately, it said the investments would slash Europe's fossil fuel import bill. ""RePowerEU will help us to save more energy, to accelerate the phasing out of fossil fuels and, most importantly, to kickstart investments on a new scale,"" Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, referring to the package. Those investments include 86 billion euros for renewable energy and 27 billion for hydrogen infrastructure, 29 billion euros for power grids and 56 billion euros for energy savings and heat pumps. The Commission said some investments in fossil fuel infrastructure would be required — 10 billion euros for a dozen gas and liquefied natural gas projects, and up to 2 billion euros for oil, targeting land-locked Central and Eastern European countries that lack access to non-Russian supply. Campaigners said those investments risked locking the EU into long-term reliance on CO2-emitting gas, fuelling climate change and high energy prices. The Commission said new gas infrastructure should be able to switch to carry renewable hydrogen in future. Brussels wants countries to finance the measures using the EU's COVID-19 recovery fund, which contains more than 200 billion euros of unspent loans. The Commission will also sell extra carbon market permits from a reserve over the next few years to raise 20 billion euros. Some analysts warned that could dampen carbon prices, undermining the price signal to shift to low-carbon energy. To spearhead the plans, the Commission proposed a higher legally-binding target to get 45 per cent of EU energy from renewable sources by 2030, replacing its current 40 per cent proposal. That would see the EU more than double its renewable energy capacity to 1,236 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, and be aided by a law allowing simpler one-year permits for wind and solar projects. The EU also proposed phasing in obligations for countries to fit new buildings with solar panels. Another target would cut EU energy consumption 13 per cent by 2030 against expected levels, replacing its current 9 per cent proposal. Europe's efforts to wean itself of Russian gas in the wake of Ukraine invasion likely to unleash of a wave of investment in so-called freedom gas from the US, observers say. The EU is negotiating laws to renovate buildings faster to use less energy, and said voluntary actions such as turning down thermostats could cut gas and oil demand by 5 per cent. The legally-binding targets require approval from EU countries and lawmakers. The EU plan includes a short-term dash for non-Russian gas supplies to replace the 155 billion cubic metres Europe buys from Moscow each year. Europe's gas demand is expected to drop 30 per cent by 2030 to meet climate targets, but for now countries rely on fuel to heat homes, power industry and produce electricity. The EU aims to have a memorandum of understanding with Egypt and Israel by summer on supplying LNG, and aims to boost supply from countries including Canada and Algeria. Brussels will also launch a scheme for countries to jointly buy gas to attempt to negotiate better contract terms.

51,Netflix sacks 150 'great colleagues' while eyeing subscribers sharing accounts,business,"  Netflix sacks 150 staff as streaming giant records drop in profits and subscribers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Netflix on Tuesday said it had sacked about 2 per cent of its staff in a belt-tightening move after growth slowed at the once-booming streaming television service. ""These changes are primarily driven by business needs rather than individual performance, which makes them especially tough, as none of us wants to say goodbye to such great colleagues,"" a spokesperson said. About 150 employees have been laid off, most of them in the United States, the spokesperson said, adding that Netflix also cut spending on contractors. The moves came just weeks after Netflix reported that it lost subscribers for the first time in more than a decade. ""Our slowing revenue growth means we are also having to slow our cost growth as a company,"" the spokesperson said. Netflix ended the first quarter of this year with 221.6 million subscribers, slightly less than the final quarter of last year. The company blamed the quarter-over-quarter erosion to suspension of its service in Russia due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. A drop of just 200,000 users -- less than 0.1 per cent of its total customer base -- was enough to send Wall Street panicking when Netflix reported quarterly earnings in April. Chief financial officer Spence Neumann said on an earnings call that Netflix would be ""pulling back"" on spending for the next two years, while continuing to invest billions of dollars in the platform. The Silicon Valley tech firm reported a net income of $1.6 billion in the recently ended quarter, compared to $1.7 billion in the same period a year earlier. Netflix believes that factors hampering its growth include subscribers sharing accounts with people not living in their homes. Netflix has hinted it will start cracking down on password sharing after posting an unexpected drop in subscribers. The streaming giant estimated that while it has nearly 222 million households paying for its service, accounts are shared with more than 100 million other households not paying subscription fees. Netflix is testing ways to make money from people sharing accounts, such as by introducing a feature that lets subscribers pay slightly more to add other households. ""When we were growing fast it wasn't a high priority and now we're working super hard on it,"" chief executive Reed Hastings said of account sharing during an earnings call. ""These are over a hundred million households that already are choosing to view Netflix; they love the service, we've just got to get paid in some degree for them."" Another factor crimping Netflix's growth is intense competition from titans such as Apple and Disney. Netflix is looking at adding a lower-priced subscription tier subsidised by advertising, a model that Hastings had long snubbed.

52,"ASX tumbles, Dow Jones drops 1,100 points as Wall Street suffers its worst sell-off since 2020",business,"  ASX tumbles, Dow Jones drops 1,100 points as Wall Street suffers its worst sell-off since 2020 Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian shares have fallen sharply on Thursday, after Wall Street suffered its worst daily sell-off in two years as commodity prices slumped and inflation concerns resurfaced. Nearly all sectors ended lower, led down by battered consumer stocks. The ASX 200 index fell 1.7 per cent, to 7,065, while the All Ordinaries index also lost 1.7 per cent, to 7,303. Retail stocks were the worst performers, including JB Hi-Fi (-6.6 per cent), Wesfarmers (-7.8 per cent), Super Retail Group (-6 per cent) , Woolworths (-5.6 per cent) and Harvey Norman (-5.5 per cent). The nation's largest companies also posted heavy losses, including Westpac (-4.1 per cent), Rio Tinto (-2.1 per cent), Graincorp (-4 per cent) and REA Group (-3.7 per cent). Meanwhile, the Australian dollar rose 0.8 per cent to 70.11 US cents amid signs that Shanghai is reopening from its strict COVID-19 lockdown, reversing a more than 1 per cent slump for the currency overnight. By 4:55pm AEST, it had come off its daily high and was buying 69.77 US cents. Brent crude oil rose 1.2 per cent to $US110.36 a  barrel, while spot gold was weaker at $US1814.21 an ounce. Woodside Petroleum shareholders overwhelmingly gave their support to the energy giant's merger with BHP's petroleum business, with more than 97 per cent of votes cast in favour of the deal. The merger will create one of the world's biggest oil and gas producers, worth $US40 billion. However, nearly half of investors voted against the company's annual climate report, which does not set targets for reducing customer emissions, also known as scope 3 emissions. Investor advisory group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said Woodside was not serious about tackling climate change. ""Woodside's paltry climate targets cover just 10 per cent of its emissions footprint and rely almost completely on offsets to meet these targets,"" said ACCR's Harriet Kater. ""Woodside has made it very clear to investors that it has no real intention of shifting its business model away from fossil fuels."" Woodside shares fell 2.8 per cent, while BHP lost 1.7 per cent by the close of trade. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index shed 1,165 points, or 3.6 per cent, to 31,490, its heaviest single-day loss since June 2020. It was the lowest close for the Dow since March 2021. Our latest burst of inflation is weird, and resistant to rate hikes. But if the Reserve Bank isn't careful, too many more rate hikes like this might help bring on a recession. The S&P 500 closed 4 per cent lower, at 3,924, also its worst drop since June 2020. Since the year began, the benchmark index is down about 17 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite plunged 4.7 per cent, to 11,418, the largest drop in the tech-heavy index since May 5. It has also plummeted about 27 per cent in the past five months. US retailer Target lost a quarter of its value in one trading day, after confirming it was the latest victim of surging inflation. Its March quarter profit fell by half and the company warned of a bigger margin hit on rising fuel and freight costs. Its shares fell by 25 per cent, its worst session since the Black Monday crash on October 19, 1987. ""We think the developing impact on retail spending — as inflation outpaces wages for even longer than people might have expected — is a principal factor in causing the market sell-off today,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""Retailers are starting to reveal the impact of eroding consumer purchasing power."" Interest-rate sensitive mega-cap growth stocks added to recent declines. Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft all fell sharply. European markets also fell sharply, including Britain's FTSE (-1.1 per cent), Germany's DAX (-1.3 per cent) and France's CAC (-1.2 per cent). The gloomy mood was underscored by a 9 per cent surge in the United Kingdom's consumer prices and a faster-than-expected acceleration in Canada. British inflation surged to its highest annual rate since 1982 as energy bills soared, according to the Office for National Statistics. Knock-on effects from Russia's invasion of Ukraine mean those bills are likely to jump again in October. Last month, the International Monetary Fund forecast Britain in 2023 would face slower economic growth and more persistent inflation than any other major economy. Meanwhile, Canadian inflation rose to 6.8 per cent last month. That rise was largely driven by food and shelter prices, which have surged to levels not seen since the early 1980s, Statistics Canada data showed. Prices are rapidly rising worldwide, forcing central banks to hike interest rates, despite the likely impact on growth. ""The cons outweigh the pros for growth stocks at this particular moment, and the market is trying to decide how bad it's going to get,"" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""The market is fearful of the next six months. We may find out that it doesn't need to be as fearful as this, and markets do tend to overreact on the downside."" The argument that wages will grow when unemployment is lower is refuted in a new report by some of Australia's leading industrial relations experts. Rising inflation, the conflict in Ukraine, prolonged supply chain snarls, pandemic-related lockdowns in China and monetary policy tightening by central banks have weighed on financial markets recently, stoking concerns about a global economic slowdown. On Wednesday (local time), Wells Fargo Investment Institute said it expects a mild US recession at the end of 2022 and early 2023. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell vowed on Tuesday that the US central bank would raise rates as high as needed to kill a surge in inflation that, he said, threatened the foundation of the economy. Traders are pricing in 50-basis point interest rate hikes by the Fed in June and July.

53,What are the rules around truth in political advertising in a federal election?,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Australian Electoral Commission says signs falsely depicting independent candidates as part of the Greens are in breach of the electoral act. Conservative lobby group Advance Australia authorised signs showing ACT Senate candidate David Pocock and Warringah candidate Zali Steggall as Greens candidates. But neither candidate has been endorsed by the party. Signs featuring independent candidate David Pocock first appeared back in April. Mr Pocock slammed the group behind the signs on social media and then lodged a formal complaint with the AEC. At the time, the AEC said its preliminary view was that the corflutes did not breach political advertising laws. But this week the AEC said the signs, which were also used against Zali Steggall in Warringah, were misleading and should not be displayed. The AEC also said Advance Australia has agreed not to display the signs to avoid legal proceedings. Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues Mr Pocock said he was disappointed by how long the AEC took to act on the misleading advertising. He has also written to the commission requesting Advance Australia be prosecuted for breaching the Electoral Act. ""Clearly, it shows just how much work we need to do in terms of truth in political advertising,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be on voters to have to wade through the nonsense and lies come election time. ""[These signs] were clearly designed to mislead and we should have laws in place that stop these sorts of things happening. ""We've got them here in the ACT and we've got them in South Australia, and they work well."" The Electoral Act doesn't actually require truth in electoral advertising. What it does do is prohibit printing, publishing or distributing, or causing, permitting — or authorising to be printed, published or distributed — any matter or thing that is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote. A valid defence is if the person can prove they didn't know, or couldn't reasonably have been expected to know, that it was likely to mislead an elector in casting their vote. Court cases have clarified the Act only concerns conduct that might affect the process of casting a vote, rather than forming a political judgement about how the vote will be cast. ""An obvious example would be information which told a voter how to go about completing the ballot paper which was wrong and would result in the casting of an informal vote,"" the AEC website states. At the 2019 federal election, purple and white signs were placed near similarly coloured AEC signs at 13 polling stations in Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's seat of Kooyong and 29 polling booths in Liberal MP Gladys Liu's seat of Chisholm. The signs told voters to preference the Liberal Party first. Written in Mandarin, the signs told voters ""the correct way to vote"" was to put a ""1"" by the Liberal candidate's name. The Federal Court found the signs were misleading or deceptive when placed next to AEC signs. The court dismissed a challenge to Ms Liu and Mr Frydenberg's election victories, saying there was ""no real chance"" the corflutes could have affected the results. The court also did not refer the Liberal party’s former Victorian state director Simon Frost to the high court, despite his admission that the signs were intended to look like the AEC's material. South Australia has had truth in political advertising since the 1980s. The state's electoral laws make it an office to authorise or publish electoral advertisements that are materially inaccurate and misleading. Australian political parties are banned from peddling mistruths in a state campaign but have no such handbrake when devising ads in the contest for the highest parliament in the land, writes Matt Wordsworth. The SA Electoral Commissioner can request such ads be withdrawn from further publication and a retraction published. The penalty is a $5,000 fine for a person and $25,000 for a corporation and an election can even be declared void if the misleading advertising is so grave that the result was affected. There have been calls for similar federal laws from across the political spectrum for years. A survey by the Australia Institute found 85 per cent of Coalition voters, 84 per cent of Labor voters, 87 per cent of Greens voters and 88 per cent of One Nation voters supported a proposal. In the 2019 election campaign, Ms Steggall called for a reform of political advertising laws after activist group Advance Australia's ads claimed she supported Labor’s franking credits policy. Liberal MP Jason Falinski has also supported truth in political advertising laws, saying: ""We have truth in advertising across the board: it just doesn’t apply to political campaigns"". Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said he would have ""a very close look"" at such laws following Labor's ""Mediscare"" campaign for the 2016 election. Esther Chan from First Draft, an organisation researching misinformation and disinformation, said some narratives in this election campaign circulating on social media appear to be US-inspired, including misleading claims about the electoral system and voting processes. An animated cartoon posted by One Nation leader Pauline Hanson is removed from multiple social media platforms after it was flagged for spreading false claims about election fraud in Australia. ""There are a lot of individual abuses and we do not know what their aims are but also notably political parties, especially minor parties sharing false claims and conspiracy theories about the electoral system and voting process,"" she said. ""A couple of weeks ago there was a video posted by One Nation on Facebook containing false claims about voter fraud and that video has been taken down by a number of platforms. ""But there are copies going around in other platforms that do not moderate content because of how they position themselves — these are platforms that we are more focused on because users are not really sure about what is false or misleading."" Ms Chan said those claims had been monitored on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, as well as the more private platforms of Telegram and Discord. ""We are not sure how many people actually believe in this but as it becomes more viral it is something to worry about.""

54,Telcos frustrated the Coalition is using private-sector millions to promote infrastructure projects,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Some of Australia's largest telecommunications companies are frustrated the Coalition is dragging them into its re-election bid, with the government trumpeting 100 infrastructure investments which are partly funded by private companies. Industry sources have told the ABC there are serious concerns about the management of the latest round of the Regional Connectivity Program (RCP), which the Commonwealth is funding to the tune of $140 million. Regional Communications Minister Bridget McKenzie's office is being accused of using campaign letterhead to spruik upgrades to things such as mobile phone infrastructure as Coalition government achievements, when telcos are chipping in tens of millions of dollars in support and had been instrumental in backing and advocating for the projects. Applications for round two of the RCP closed in December, yet the majority of the announcements of successful projects have been made after the election was called and campaigning began. Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues The Coalition insisted this was prior to caretaker provisions coming into effect, and said the announcements were about Commonwealth funding commitments, not private-sector costs. The Commonwealth's share of funding was baked into Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's pre-election budget. In addition to the administrative go-slow, sources have told the ABC the Coalition has been announcing successful projects without giving the telcos prior notice, with executives only finding out upgrades they are funding are in the public domain when greeted with press releases. Senator McKenzie's office made announcements of projects across the country — 29 in Western Australia, 14 in New South Wales, 15 in Victoria, 21 in Queensland, 10 in the Northern Territory and 11 in South Australia. Telstra is the biggest private financial backer, funding 63 of the projects at a cost of $30.6 million. The company told the ABC it also helped convince state governments and other stakeholders to chip in $22.6 million. ""We were pleased to get the funding so we can continue to co-invest with the government to improve services in regional Australia,"" a spokesperson said. ""We were alerted by the government to the successful projects, however, you would need to ask the government why they chose the timing and approach."" Sources have told the ABC that Telstra's frustrations had been made clear to the office of Senator McKenzie, but the response was dismissive. The Coalition's announcement of one project, upgrading mobile infrastructure along the Silver City Highway between Mildura and Broken Hill, caught Telstra by surprise. When the ABC's local reporters contacted the telco for further details, the company had no idea the project was slated to be announced by Environment Minister and Member for Farrer, Sussan Ley. Australia has spent billions on the NBN yet its speeds are still bad — at least compared to other countries. How did we end up here? Other companies involved in the upgrades include Optus and Vodafone, although neither company was prepared to go on the record. The ABC has been told the frustrations are shared, although the process was not considered overly surprising. The Coalition's Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) was approached for comment, asked why there was a delay in announcing the projects and why telcos were not given advance warning of announcements. CCHQ was also asked how it was appropriate to use campaign letterhead to spruik the deals, and why the Coalition seemed to be dragging the work of private companies into its election pitch to voters. ""The Coalition's announcements were of government grant contributions, not private sector contributions,"" a spokesperson for CCHQ said in a statement. ""Public announcements of private-sector contributions are a matter for the individual companies to disclose. ""The timing of announcements of successful government grants is a matter for the government.""

55,The pressure is on in Shanghai to remain COVID-zero,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Health authorities in Shanghai are facing ""huge"" pressure to keep China's most populous city free of COVID-19 as residents are counting down the days until June 1 and the end of their lockdown after almost two months of isolation. The commercial hub of 25 million achieved a fourth consecutive day without any new infections in the community, holding on to its prized ""zero-COVID"" status and keeping alive hopes for an imminent end to its lockdown misery. Despite no new cases, authorities are not lifting the lockdown immediately, instead gradually easing restrictions until June 1, with some shops allowed to open this week and public transport expected to partly resume over the weekend. Residents at housing compounds across Shanghai have been given passes that allow one person from each household to go out for a few hours at a time. Some can go out only twice a week and only within a few streets of their home. To get into a supermarket, they also need a pass from the shop. ""The risk of finding positive infections among risk groups still exists and the pressure of … preventing a rebound remains huge,"" Zhao Dandan of the municipal health commission said. The government of Shanghai's Xuhui district posted pictures on its social media account of workers planting flowers alongside largely deserted streets to ensure a ""clean and beautiful"" environment for the ""resumption of work and production in the city"". However, in the central district of Changning, big piles of trash spilled onto the roads in a sign of how the city has struggled to maintain services during the lockdown. As part of the gradual reopening, Shanghai authorities issued a list of 864 financial institutions that can resume work, said three sources with knowledge of the matter. Social media posts have shown long queues of people, most of them migrant workers, outside one of the city's main railway stations, looking to return to their home towns after getting permission to go outside. Some have been photographed hauling suitcases on rented bikes or making long walks from distant corners of the city. The United States, Europe and other regions have lifted restrictions to ""live with the virus"" and get their economies going, even as fresh infections spread. However, China has chosen a radically different path, ruthlessly restricting movement and isolating people to end any outbreak, no matter the economic cost. Defeating the highly transmissible Omicron variant has proven an uphill battle, as the struggle in the capital, Beijing, over the past month has shown. Beijing authorities have been discovering dozens of new cases almost every day since April 22. While most Beijing residents are working from home, they can at least wander about outside, albeit with few places to go, as many shops, gyms and other businesses have closed in several districts. ""I'm happy that we are not confined at home like in Shanghai but still pretty frustrated at what's happening, as most of the countries have already moved on from COVID,"" said Lin Cong, 27, who lives in Chaoyang district, the epicentre of the outbreak. Overall, Shanghai reported fewer than 1,000 new cases for May 17, none from outside a quarantined area. Beijing reported 69 cases, up from 52. China's uncompromising strategy to fight COVID-19 has placed hundreds of millions of people in dozens of cities under restrictions of some kind and disrupted a global rebound in production of everything from mobile phones to electric vehicles. Companies from Apple to Tesla have taken a hit. E-commerce group JD.com said on Tuesday it was cautious about its outlook, because consumers were losing income and confidence and logistics have been disrupted. Still, investor sentiment towards JD.com and its peers has improved after comments Vice-Premier Liu He made at a Tuesday meeting with tech executives. He fanned hopes that a regulatory crackdown on the sector was easing. The unprecedented crackdown, which began in 2020, has hit technology companies and roiled markets, shaving billions of dollars in market value, and weighing heavily on an important growth driver. A more free-wheeling tech sector would not, however, make up for the headwinds China is facing from COVID-19, a property sector downturn, geopolitics and rising borrowing costs in the United States and elsewhere. New home prices in China fell in April for the first time since December, data showed on Wednesday. Chinese shares dipped and the yuan softened as bonds faced continued capital outflows. This week, data showed consumption and factory output falling in April at a pace unseen since early 2020, as COVID-19 — first detected in Wuhan city in late 2019 — was beginning its global spread. According to analysts, China is likely to struggle to stage a quick recovery without compromising on its ""zero-COVID"" policy.

56,Abandoned customers furious as solar panel company stops answering calls,business,"  Four Seasons Solar customers consider legal action after company fails to deliver Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Julie Waters is preparing to take a company to court after an attempt to get more sustainable power descended into a months-long saga which she said left her $900 out of pocket. Her gripe is with West Australian company Four Seasons Solar, which the ABC called, texted, emailed and sent a Facebook message seeking comment on Monday. But by Tuesday, the company's website and Facebook pages could not be accessed and the landline had been disconnected. Ms Waters came across Four Seasons Solar in October last year when she said she paid them a $900 deposit for solar panels on her Esperance home. She said friends had recommended the company and it offered the most affordable solar panel prices she could find. But the small micro grid that powers the south coast town is fragile and solar allocation is managed so as not to reduce stability. After missing out on an allocation in November, Ms Waters said the company told her it would keep the deposit until March, as they thought more capacity may be released then. She said March came and went with no word from the company about refunding her $900 — a payment which the company confirmed via email but for which she said she never received a receipt. For a few weeks she said she called and emailed the company weekly and then, suspecting something was amiss, ramped things up a notch. ""I thought 'I'm getting serious, I'm going to call them every day and email them every day',"" she said. But after two more weeks of daily phone calls, emails and Facebook messages with no reply, she wrote to Consumer Protection. A response from the Geraldton office, seen by the ABC, said they had failed to get in touch with the company and suggested she take the matter to the Magistrates Court. ""…attempts to communicate with Four Seasons Solar has been unsuccessful after numerous attempts to seek a response from them,"" the response said. ""If you intend to pursue this matter further, you may consider the option of lodging a Consumer/Trader claim in the Magistrates Court."" Ms Waters now intends to do so. Esperance resident Shari McDermott has an almost identical story. She and her husband signed a supply and installation contract with Four Seasons Solar in October. The contract, seen by the ABC, shows they paid the company a $780 deposit. ""Their customer service was excellent, they seemed to be genuine and that's why we decided to go with them,"" Ms McDermott said. They too were told they had missed out on the solar release from Horizon Power and were told to wait for another in March. Again, they said countless attempts to get in the touch with the company were unsuccessful and they were still chasing their money. ""We just had a baby, we've got another one on the way, we're on a single income — that $780 is a lot of money to us,"" she said. ""We thought we would do the right thing in helping a small business out rather than getting a big company to do it… and I think [in the future] maybe we will think twice about doing that and go with one of the bigger companies because it will be more reliable."" She said she and her husband were considering joining Ms Water's court proceedings against Four Seasons Solar. A Consumer Protection spokesperson said it could not comment on the case. But he reiterated the obligations of solar traders. ""If the trader makes a commitment to lodge an application on the consumer's behalf relating to incentive schemes, then they must do so,"" the spokesperson said. ""If they do not meet this commitment, and/or are otherwise unable to supply the goods/services, the consumer may be entitled to a remedy under the Australian Consumer Law.""

57,'That's serious money': Outback NSW graziers frustrated by lengthy road closures as costs add up,business,"  Far West NSW graziers call for urgent fix for roads around Menindee after lengthy closures Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Landowners across Far West NSW say they have had enough of poorly maintained roads being closed for several weeks and even months after rain. The closures have affected the road from Menindee to Ivanhoe, and Menindee to Pooncarie, and have previously fallen over school holiday periods, causing major detours for locals. Grazier Terry Smith from Scarsdale Station near Menindee said the road closures had added an extra 250 kilometres to livestock freight trips. ""We had livestock going down to Melbourne and wanted to pick up more stock south of Menindee and go down that way but the truck had to come back to Broken Hill, down to Wentworth and up to Pooncarie to get there,"" he said. ""B-doubles run on about six bucks a kilometre at the moment … so there's an extra 1,800 bucks worth of freight."" The delays mean graziers could risk thousands of dollars in heavy penalties for ageing livestock. ""If you can't get your lambs out on time and they become hoggets or sheep you get penalised for that at the processor and that can cost you up to $20,000 on a truck load of lambs, that's serious money,"" Mr Smith said. There has been more rain in recent years, in places where widespread drought plagued much of the region before La Niña hit in 2020. But even small amounts of rain have closed roads for weeks at a time. ""The rain we had was decent rain, but it wasn't a natural disaster or anything,"" Mr Smith said. ""These are major roads that connect this part of the world. ""There are six roads that lead into Menindee and only one of them has been open for the last three weeks and that's the Broken Hill road … we've had enough."" Want more local news? Sign up to the weekly ABC Broken Hill email newsletter Mr Smith said some parts of the road had not been graded for 18 months. ""I don't think everyone out there expects the roads to be sealed ... that's probably fairyland stuff, but we expect them to be reasonably serviceable and not go out on such regular occasions,"" he said. ""Sometimes it's only a couple of loads of dirt in a low spot or a bit of a quick fix [that] would certainly help it be serviceable more regularly."" Mr Smith wrote a letter to local, state and federal MPs on behalf of NSW farmers in 2011 when some unsealed roads were closed for seven months after rain. ""We're heading down that same sort of scenario now,"" he said. Barwon MP Roy Butler admitted parts of the Menindee Ivanhoe road needed more than just grading work. ""It's beyond needing a grader, it needs more substantial work and they have got seven grading crews in the Central Darling Shire at the moment working on the 2,600 kilometres of unsealed road,"" he said. NSW's regional roads fall under the local council's responsibility, typically with funding provided by the federal government. ""I suspect the answer in the short term the council will need more cash, more resource to be able to bring in more crews, so we're not seeing months of roads closed,"" Mr Butler said. ""I’ve reached out to NSW Regional Transport Minister Sam Faraway as well and I'll probably be speaking to him later this week in regards to what can be done.""

58,Flood-hit retailers at major Brisbane shopping centre have leases terminated,business,"  Brisbane's Toombul Shopping Centre retailers have leases terminated by Mirvac after floods Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Retailers and shoppers have been left devastated by developer Mirvac's cancellation of retail leases after Toombul Shopping Centre was flooded in February. Business owners have been receiving letters informing them ""it is impractical and undesirable to reinstate the centre to how it was prior to the flooding damage"". ""As a result, to provide our retailers with certainty we have taken the difficult decision to close Toombul Shopping Centre and terminate all leases,"" the correspondence said. ""We are now assessing the future of the site, recognising the importance of continued provision of retail services for the local community."" Fruits of Eden and Eleni's Gourmet Deli owner Eleni Pippos said she was saddened by the decision, but was ""one of the lucky ones that were covered by flood insurance"". ""We have now received an official letter from Toombul Shopping Centre in regards to the future of the centre,"" she said. ""We are in talks with a few people in regards to a new premises, but needed the confirmation from Toombul with what was going to happen before we decided on the future of our store. ""Obviously this has impacted us with no income since closure, but yet again we were lucky with the Insurance side of things. ""We thank you all for your support at Toombul and miss seeing your faces. ""We hope to see you soon once we secure another store."" Mister Minit franchisee Trevor Kelley said he also received a letter cancelling his lease. He said the closure was ""disappointing"" and that Mirvac had left ""a lot of people hanging"". ""It's hard to move on,"" Mr Kelley said. ""I've got to start another business from scratch. ""I've put the last 20 years into that — [it] was going to be my retirement. ""We just scraped through COVID — I thought, 'Now I've got a year or two to put some money behind us for retirement.' ""Now, I can't get flood insurance because we weren't flooded and Centrelink refused to give me anything."" Mr Kelley said no-one at Mister Minit expected Mirvac to terminate leases. ""Mirvac owned the centre at Hinkler in Bundaberg and when it flooded they reopened,"" he said. A Mirvac spokesperson said the company had ""undertaken extensive assessments to understand the full impact of the flood damage at Toombul shopping centre"". ""As previously advised, there has been extensive damage to the centre across all major services, base building services and infrastructure,"" the spokesperson said. ""After taking into account the current and potential future impacts of flooding on the site, it is impractical and undesirable to reinstate the centre to how it was prior to the flooding damage. ""We appreciate this a disappointing outcome for our retailers and customers who are very loyal to our centre, with many tenants operating from Toombul for many years."" Documents sent to retailers also mentioned the centre's electricity, fire, air-conditioning systems, lifts and escalators ""all need significant repairs or replacement and mould is a significant issue"". ""Therefore all areas of the centre are not fit for occupation under the relevant building codes and reinstatement of services to allow UPSTAIRS to trade independently of ground level is not possible at this time,"" the letter read.

60,"Bonnie is one of many employers struggling to find staff, so why aren't workers being paid more?",business,"  Wages growth edges up, but still a long way short of the rising cost of living Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian workers saw their base wages rise an average of 0.7 per cent over the March quarter and 2.4 per cent over the past year, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The annual pay rise trails a 5.1 per cent jump in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, over the same period. Jobs website Indeed's Asia-Pacific economist Callam Pickering said this means Australian workers effectively took a big pay cut. ""After accounting for inflation, Australian wages have collapsed over the past year,"" Mr Pickering observed. ""We haven't seen real wage growth this weak since the introduction of the GST. ""The disconnect between wage growth and inflation would be devastating for household budgets across the country."" Scott Bowerman is not surprised that wages are not picking up more quickly. He worked as chef for 20 years but, after the pandemic hit, he started a labour-hire business, Chef 4 Hire, in the Victorian regional town of Wodonga. It was hit hard by staff shortages during pandemic lockdowns. However, unlike many employers in the hospitality industry, Mr Bowerman said he was no longer having trouble finding workers. ""I've put on 20 staff, with another three over this week, so it's really busy,"" he told The Business. While the cost of living has jumped and many employers complain of staff shortages, Mr Bowerman said most workers in the hospitality industry still were not paid well. When the value of money changes, it doesn't change equally for everyone, writes Gareth Hutchens He suspects that is why some businesses are struggling to attract and retain staff. ""You're probably looking at around about $15 to $18 an hour for a school kitchen hand, but I pay well above that,"" he said. ""I pay $28 an hour, and that's just a weekday, so it is quite a big difference."" However, he can see a longer term crisis brewing in the sector, with fewer young people undertaking formal training. Mr Bowerman said TAFE in Wodonga has gone from just over 20 students enrolling as first-year apprentices to just six places this year. ""It's just completely died, our industry,"" he lamented. ""I'm in the middle of trying to raise that up and talk to high schools and try and get more students and more kids into the industry because, at the moment, we're going to go backwards. The lack of trainees is an urgent crisis in some sectors, which rely on students to provide additional labour. Bonnie Kelepouris runs e-Dentist Dental Clinic in Melbourne. She said staff shortages have worsened after many people left the industry during COVID-19 lockdowns and because there were not as many international students studying dentistry in Australia. She said those students used to work as dental assistants, but now they are hard to find. ""The staff shortage issue is quite challenging in our industry, not only the lack of applicants applying for positions that we have available, but also the short supply coming from temp agencies,"" Ms Kelepouris observed. ""If we do have staff off unwell, it is a real challenge to fill those positions. ""We don't have access to international students … especially dentists [in] training, who needed to get up their clinical hours. ""A lot of them did sign up to temp agencies, or were available, you know, as casual staff to clinics. That has really declined since the pandemic."" Ms Kelepouris said even support and administration staff now attract much higher rates. ""At a lot of practices at the moment, the hourly rate they're offering is 20 to 30 per cent above what we would have been looking at a few years ago,"" she added. A slight increase from the previous December numbers (2.3 per cent) takes annual wage growth back to its highest level since June 2019. But wage growth remains well below the average level of 3.1 per cent recorded since the ABS started publishing this figure in 1998. The last time annual wages growth exceeded that average was all the way back in March 2013. The bureau's head of price statistics, Michelle Marquardt, said a small proportion of in-demand workers in ""market sensitive"" occupations were getting larger pay rises, dragging up the average. ""Wage growth is influenced by both the size of changes in hourly wage rates and the proportion of jobs recording a change,"" she explained. ""In March quarter 2022, the average size of private-sector hourly wage rises increased to 3.4 per cent, the highest quarter increase since June 2013."" The Commonwealth Bank of Australia's head of Australian economics, Gareth Aird, said the ABS data was backed up by more-recent data his team had compiled from analysing CBA customer bank accounts. ""The upshot is that, whilst wages growth across the economy is moving higher and some people are receiving large pay rises, there [are] not broad-based wages pressures,"" he noted. Canberra-based data analyst Adam Stephan-Slade is in one of those in-demand occupations. He was hired at the start of this year as the business operations manager for horse racing information and news service, Racing and Sports, having spent the most of his working life delivering technology and managing projects for defence. ""There was an opportunity to move to a new and exciting industry as well as get a little bit of a pay bump [of] about 10 per cent,"" he said. ""They felt that I could deliver some value with my experience and delivering technical capabilities."" Mr Stephan-Slade said networks – knowing the right people – helped him land the job. ""If you know good people, [who] you can tap on the shoulder and start a conversation, I think that really helps,"" he said. Workers such as Tarsh Soxsmith are taking advantage of the strong jobs market to get better pay and more flexible conditions Now he is in a position to hire staff. ""Since I've joined, there has been a number of new hires,"" he added. However, only 15 per cent of private-sector workers got a raise in the March quarter. This is not unusual, as most businesses tend to pass annual pay rises on to workers at the start of each new financial year, so they show up in the September quarter numbers. However, the ABS seasonally adjusted numbers account for this trend, meaning that the March figure is genuinely disappointing. Most economists had tipped a wage rise in the range of 0.8 per cent for the quarter and 2.5 per cent for the year. The Reserve Bank governor has repeatedly said that wage increases well above 3 per cent are needed to sustainably maintain inflation in the bank's 2-3 per cent target range. The argument that wages will grow when unemployment is lower is refuted in a new report by some of Australia's leading industrial relations experts. Mr Pickering said economists are somewhat puzzled as to why wages growth is not responding more strongly to falling unemployment. ""Australian wage growth remains at odds with an unemployment rate that is at a near 50-year low,"" he noted. ""The slow rate of improvement would be a concern for policymakers such as the Reserve Bank of Australia."" After Wednesday's disappointing wages data, most economists now expect the Reserve Bank to lift interest rates by only 25 basis points at its June 7 meeting. ""The RBA is not facing a prices-wages spiral like is being observed in some other jurisdictions,"" Mr Aird noted. ""Put another way: The RBA does not have to run hard against wages growth by aggressively hiking the cash rate."" The CBA is currently expecting the cash rate target to top out at 1.6 per cent by early next year, up from the current 0.35 per cent, but well below market pricing for a peak RBA rate above 3 per cent.

61,'Whole new cost': Disaster victims bemoan election policy silence amid sky-rocketing insurance ,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Ruth Haggar does not know when her new house will be rebuilt, let alone what it will cost to insure when the time comes. When she lost her Quaama home on the NSW Far South Coast during the Black Summer bushfires, she discovered she was under-insured by $100,000. The rising cost of building supplies has seen that figure blow out to $200,000. ""We insured to one standard, not understanding if you lose that house you have to build to a new standard — maybe with double glazing and closed-in decks,"" she said. ""It's a whole new cost."" With disasters becoming increasingly common and severe, there are fears insurance in the event of a flood or bushfire will become out of reach for many Australians. Ms Haggar hopes to insure her new home when it is eventually rebuilt to the required standard, but is prepared for costs to rise. ""It's definitely not fair that some people can afford to insure and others can't,"" she said. ""The government will have to do something because it's going to be more and more challenging to insure places with this climate change."" But the cost of insuring and mitigating against the impacts of climate change has barely featured in the federal election campaign. ""We do need to know that we can rely on our government, that if we experience disaster that they will be there for us, Ms Haggar said. ""I don't know why they're not speaking up on this issue."" The government this year legislated a $10 billion reinsurance pool for cyclone-affected areas in northern Australia, but a coalition campaign spokesperson did not answer the ABC's questions about whether they would consider expanding it to also underwrite insurance in flood and bushfire-prone areas. A federal Labor campaign spokesperson also failed to address questions about a national reinsurance scheme, referring instead to a $200 million commitment for ""disaster readiness and mitigation measures"", including ""better planning"". But Liberal Member for Leichhardt Warren Entsch, who has long been an advocate of the northern scheme as a means of reducing the costs of insurance premiums, said it had the potential to expand. ""We've got a pilot model here if you'd like,"" he said. Whether you have started the clean-up or are preparing for flooding, here is how to make an insurance claim. ""Let's get this one right because we can then look at how we can allocate additional funds into the reinsurance pool. ""I think floods are going to be a classic example of the next one, and bushfires."" Business owner and Ballina Shire councillor Rod Bruem said even if the scheme did extend to flood zones, the rate of climate change means it might be too late. His Lismore farm and small business were among thousands devastated in the flood disaster earlier this year. The Insurance Council of Australia has said at $3.4 billion, the insurance cost of the combined floods in NSW and Queensland was the nation's ""most expensive"" flood on record and the fifth worst disaster. Mr Bruem, who used to be a member of the Nationals but is now an independent, said politicians are ""too late"" and should have come up with a solution long before the election. ""I've been concerned about the availability of insurance in the region since moving my business from Sydney to here nearly a decade ago,"" he said. ""It's becoming increasingly difficult to get it at all. ""The sentiment is, after this disaster, it's going to be that much worse."" Matthew Jones from the insurance council agrees climate change is ""worsening"" the situation, and that insurance companies, government, and the public need to work together. He said measures such as retrofitting homes and installing public infrastructure to protect towns, like flood levees, were ""not a silver bullet"", and government should also focus on land use planning. ""We need to stop building homes in area of high risk,"" Mr Jones said. For now, Ruth Haggar is trying to remain optimistic she will be able to afford to insure her new home. ""It could get to the point where it wouldn't be affordable for me,"" she said. ""You just live in hope that it doesn't happen to you.""

62,'Couldn't believe someone would stoop to that level': CLP-endorsed pro-fracking campaign attacks pastoralists,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A pro-fracking group, which has been reprimanded by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and endorsed by CLP candidates, has attacked a couple that owns a Northern Territory cattle station in the sights of several gas companies. Back Beetaloo's corflutes and Facebook ads have cropped up across the Territory during the federal election, but without an official authorisation it is difficult to determine who is behind the campaign, despite claims it is a ""grassroots"" organisation. One ad, a banner hung on an overpass on one of Darwin’s busiest roads, has taken aim at the Ravazzotti family, which owns several stations in the Beetaloo region. The family opposes fracking in the Beetaloo and the ad accuses it of using “foreign control to block thousands of jobs coming to the NT”. The Beetaloo Basin is a large gas resource 700 kilometres south west of Darwin, which gas companies are hoping to commercialise in the next few years. The banner has since been removed. Darwin City Council told the ABC it had no records of an application to hang the banner, nor records of council workers taking it down. Since 2018, the Ravazzotti family has invested more than $200 million buying six cattle stations in the Top End, four of which are in the Beetaloo Basin. During a visit to Darwin, one of the family’s station managers saw the banner on Bagot Road and sent a photo to Luciana Ravazzotti. “We couldn’t believe that someone would stoop to that level, to personally attack us,” she said. Ms Ravazzotti and her partner, Pierre Langenhoven, moved to Australia from South Africa 22 years ago. “We are Australian citizens, we absolutely love Australia and our lives are here,” she said. All of the Country Liberal Party (CLP) candidates in this year's federal election have appeared on the organisation's Facebook page, wearing branded T-shirts. This worried Ms Ravazzotti. “Politicians are there to look after all of their constituents,” she said. ""If they want to support one group, they need to come look at pastoralists and understand the challenges pastoralists are looking at as well."" On its Facebook page, Back Beetaloo says: ""Our mission is very simple – Tell the Federal and Territory Governments to unlock the Beetaloo Basin to benefit all Australians."" According to data published by Facebook, the organisation has spent $9,000 on Facebook ads since it was created and more than $2,000 during the election. Despite the organisations' numerous ads on Territory streets and social media, its ads lack an official authorisation, which is required of all political advertisers in Australia. The AEC said it had since written to the organisation after the ABC brought it to the governing body's attention. ""The purpose of authorisations laws are for people to know who is communicating with them,"" a spokesperson for the AEC said. The AEC said it was receiving a number of complaints each day, and was adopting a ""graduated approach to enforcement"", with the first step being a warning or reminder to advertisers. The page used to claim that it was a ""grassroots"" organisation but this description has since been removed. A search for the Back Beetaloo's domain name shows it is registered under a company called Campaign Digital. An ASIC search for the company shows it is registered to a sole trader named Nick Palmer in the Sydney suburb of Cherrybrook. Despite being founded in Sydney, Back Beetaloo's website takes aim at interstate activists. ""Unfortunately there are numerous activists from thousands of kilometres away from the Territory who are driven on depriving us from this once-in-a-lifetime economic opportunity,"" the website reads. ""Most of them genuinely could not find the Beetaloo on a map let alone know anything about the communities that would actually benefit."" The banner photo on the group's Facebook page shows a generic image of a highway cutting through red dirt and low bushes — very different country to the savanna woodlands of the Beetaloo region. Daniel Angus, a Queensland University of Technology academic who studies online culture, said the Facebook page had all the characteristics of a ""very sophisticated astroturfing campaign"". Astroturfing, he said, referred to when a brand was set up at arms length from a political organisation or political lobby and made to look grassroots or community-driven. ""When in fact, it's not ... It's been financed directly from the pockets of lobby organisations,"" he said, speaking generally about astroturfing. ""They're very corrosive, because you have these lobby groups that are well-financed, setting up pages that look authentic to sow seeds of misinformation. "" He said Back Beetaloo's ""slick design"", lack of obvious community engagement and ""inherently political"" nature fit the bill of an astroturfing campaign.

63,We fact checked Michael Sukkar on the levels of first home buyers. Here's what we found,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Michael Sukkar says Coalition policies have pushed first home buyers to their highest levels in 15 years. Is that correct? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog With interest rates on the rise, housing affordability has cemented its place as a key election issue. Following Labor's announcement of a shared equity housing scheme for low income earners, Housing Minister Michael Sukkar took to Sydney radio station 2GB to bolster his own party's housing schemes. ""Through the home builder programme, through the home guarantee scheme, through the first home supersaver scheme: we've got first home buyers at their highest levels for nearly 15 years,"" Mr Sukkar said. So, is that correct? And how much influence has government policy had on the figures? RMIT ABC Fact Check takes a look. Mr Sukkar's claim is overstated. While loans to first home buyers have not reached a 15-year high, on a number of measures, the past two years have seen such loans at a higher level than recorded since early 2010. It's worth noting, however, that since a peak in mid-2021, the number of first home buyer loans has been decreasing (though the latest figures remain higher than those recorded in the decade to 2020). As for the impact of government policies, experts told Fact Check that Coalition schemes had indeed resulted in more first home buyers, though they noted the increase was unlikely to be sustained in the long term. One expert spoke of a ""very strong expectation"" there would be a dearth of first home buyer activity in coming years as a result of demand being brought forward by government policies. The Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes monthly data on the number of new loan commitments made to first home buyers, both owner-occupiers and investors. At the time of Mr Sukkar's claim, May 2, the latest available data was for February of this year, though March figures have since been released. While Mr Sukkar did not specify whether he was referring to owner-occupiers or all first home buyers in his claim, the ABS only publishes data predating 2019 on owner-occupier first home buyers. In an email, a spokesman for Mr Sukkar told Fact Check that according to ABS data, the highest number of first home buyers since data became available in 2004 was recorded in the 2020-21 financial year. The spokesman provided a table of figures that can be derived from the ABS monthly data. However, as Fact Check explains below, using figures for the year to June does not tell the full story. Fact Check has used the bureau's seasonally adjusted data and analysed it in three ways: on rolling annual figures; on monthly figures; and on annual figures in proportion to the adult population. On the rolling annual figures, Mr Sukkar is close to the mark. As the chart below shows, after rising to 175,318 in the year to November 2009, the number of loans to first home buyers fell and remained at a consistent level — between approximately 80,000 and 106,000 loans per year — for almost a decade, before beginning to rise again in late 2019. That increase led to a recent peak in the year to July 2021, when there were 173,383 loans made to first home buyers. Indeed, the annual rolling figures of first home buyer loans recorded since the year to August 2020 have all been higher than those recorded at any point since the year to July 2010. However, this rolling annual total measure also shows first home buyer loans have been in decline consistently since their July 2021 peak. This decrease can be seen more clearly in the monthly figures, which show that the number of loans to first home owners has been falling sharply since January 2021, when 16,257 loans were recorded. Just under 10,000 new loans were made to first home owners in February 2022, a similar number to June 2020. The month with the most loans given to first home buyers in the past 15 years occurred in April 2009, when 16,753 new loans were made to first home owners. Adjusting the annual figures for population change, as depicted in the graph below, shows the recent peak compares less favourably to that which was recorded in late 2009. Fact Check has used the bureau's figures for the estimated resident population aged 18 and over, which are available for each year to June. The number has grown from 15.4 million in June 2005 to 20.1 million in June 2021. Similar to the nominal figures, the adjusted figures for the year to June 2021, which is the last full year for which population estimates are available, remain the highest for about 12 years. Contrary to the email from Mr Sukkar's spokesman, when adjusted for population the number of loans made in the year to June 2021 was not the highest made in any financial year since 2004. On the population-adjusted figures, more loans were made to first home buyers in the year to June 2009. In making his claim, Mr Sukkar attributed an increase in first home buyers to a number of government policies. The first, the HomeBuilder program, was a temporary measure announced in 2021 to support the construction industry through the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligible applicants could receive up to $25,000 towards the cost of building a new home. Mr Sukkar also referred to a home guarantee scheme. In the New Home Guarantee Scheme the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation guarantees loans for first home buyers, allowing them to purchase a new home with as little as a 5 per cent deposit. This scheme is limited to newly built properties, house and land packages, off-the-plan dwellings and land with a contract to build a home. A separate scheme, the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, opens the loans to those buying existing dwellings. Finally, Mr Sukkar referred to the First Home Super Savers Scheme, a program through which first home buyers can make concessional contributions to their superannuation which can then be withdrawn in order to purchase a home. It is worth noting that the previous peak in loans to first home buyers occurred after the Rudd government introduced a First Home Owners Boost scheme. According to Brendan Coates, the economic policy program director at the Grattan Institute, it was ""really hard"" to measure how much impact government policies had on the number of people buying their first homes. ""But I think there's no doubt that HomeBuilder and the home loan guarantee schemes have added to home ownership rates in the short term,"" he said. ""It's possible we'll see an increase in home ownership when the 2021 Census comes out in a couple of weeks."" Other factors influencing first home ownership levels, Mr Coates explained, were falling investor activity over recent years as well as low interest rates, though it was ""hard to be precise about the relative size of these effects"". Hal Pawson, a professor of housing research and policy at the University of New South Wales, agreed. ""I think the Minister's claim is not an over-statement of the impact of Coalition policy measures in 2020 and 2021,"" he told Fact Check, noting that low interest rates had also played a role. Kate Raynor, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne with expertise in housing policy, concurred that ""a big part of the increase in first home buyers is a reflection of government policy"". ""Especially as the home guarantee scheme is only targeted at first home buyers and because a high proportion of the 137,000 who accessed HomeBuilder were first home buyers,"" Dr Raynor explained. ""Another big factor driving first home buyers was low interest rates and increased savings for some due to COVID lock downs and FOMO as prices increased so rapidly."" She noted, however, that she believed the HomeBuilder scheme was a ""terrible policy intervention"". ""It fuelled inflation of construction prices and will probably mean that many will pay over $25,000 in increased construction costs or delays anyway."" All three experts told Fact Check that while government policies had driven an increase in the number of first home buyers in recent years, it was unlikely this growth would be sustained. ""One of the things you do when you introduce these kinds of schemes, particularly HomeBuilder which is time-limited, is you bring forward a whole bunch of demand,"" Mr Coates said. ""You bring forward a bunch of people that are getting ready to buy anyway."" This had happened in the past, he explained, when first home owners grants and stamp duty concessions saw a spike in first time buyers followed by a lull when the schemes were no longer available. According to Professor Pawson, there was a ""very strong expectation"" there would be a dearth of first home buyer activity in coming years as a result of demand being brought forward by government policies. ""This prediction is informed by the observation of what took place in the period 2008-12, when the Rudd Government introduced a time-limited first home buyer grant program similar to HomeBuilder,"" he explained, noting that such initiatives ""simply encourage people to advance existing plans to make their first home acquisition"". ""They cannot be credited with any significant impact in terms of enabling first home ownership for people otherwise permanently excluded.""

64,'It's like you're being penalised': Rob's had to pay thousands for a service most take for granted,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Rob Window tried to call for help as a fierce bushfire raged towards his rural Queensland property in 2018. Both the major parties have promised to improve rural telecommunications if elected Rural telecommunication advocates say people in the bush must be taught how to access what is available to them But he found himself on the end of a dead line with no service. ""You ring triple-0 and wonder what's going to happen,"" he said. He sprinted to higher ground where he got a few bars of reception as the flames licked closer. ""If I was down the back and something happened, I would have been in strife because I wouldn't be able to ring,"" he said. Mr Window and his partner Kim Russell moved from Victoria to Baffle Creek, 88 kilometres north of Bundaberg, four years ago only to find they had no phone or internet service. He said they had made countless complaints to Telstra and the NBN and spent thousands of dollars on equipment, including a booster and satellite phone for use in emergencies. ""You take it for granted that you can use your phone, particularly if you're coming from, say the suburbs of a city, and you move out to the country,"" Mr Window said. ""It's like you're being penalised for living in a rural area."" Businesses in the centre of town are struggling with the same problem. Cheryl Charles said she had lived in the Baffle Creek area for 28 years and owned the pub for almost a decade. She said she took paying customers outside to get enough reception for the EFTPOS machine to work. ""It's extremely frustrating…. We run most of our business from our carpark,"" she said. ""Customers wait for at least 10 minutes while it [the machine] just sits there and circles around and around and waits to go through."" She said she had come to accept the struggles. What do you do? Close the doors?"" she said. Real estate agent Pamela Wendt said it was unfair residents paid for a service they weren't getting. ""The hours in the day are taken up by waiting for phone calls to go through, trying to send emails, trying to get the internet pages to download so that we can use our programs,"" she said. Meanwhile, shephard Ian Reynolds said phone and internet reception were just as unreliable on his Cinnabar property, 300km south in the Gympie region. ""You'll talk to people and every third word is heard, and then your telephone discussions gradually fall away,"" he said. ""You have to go 24km to Kilkivan or Goomeri to get things fixed by phone or to contact people."" Mr Reynolds said people in the bush were last on the telecommunication companies' priority list. ""Yes, they have fixed it up, but it has taken since November until now for Telstra and NBN to get their system going again and that does put pressure on you,"" Mr Reynolds said. The Baffle Creek community feels equally let down. ""They're not interested in helping us,"" Ms Charles said. ""No one comes to rural Queensland, it's all about the city people and the bush always comes second."" Both the major parties have promised to improve rural telecommunications if elected. Labor has committed $656 million while the Coalition has announced $1.3 billion. Telstra said in a statement its 4G and 3G coverage was available in Cinnabar and Baffle Creek but the terrain and heavy vegetation in the area impacted service in some parts. It said planning was under way to install a new site at Cinnabar to improve coverage later this year. It said providing regional connectivity must be shared between federal, state and local governments and providers such as the NBN and other mobile carriers. ""Residents can improve their mobile coverage by using their NBN connection to access wi-fi calling,"" a spokesperson said. ""This is a free setting on most popular mobile phones and allows your mobile to use a wi-fi network to make and receive mobile calls."" The spokesperson said mobile coverage could sometimes be increased in homes or vehicles by fitting an external aerial or a phone booster. ""We also encourage business owners talk to their bank about connecting their EFTPOS terminals to their NBN or wi-fi connection to prevent delays in processing transactions."" Both the major parties have made big spending telecommunication promises to try to secure rural and regional votes. Labor has committed $656 million, including: The Coalition has announced $1.3 billion for telecommunications and connectivity in regional, rural, remote and peri-urban communities. It includes a new $811.8 million Connecting Regional Australia Initiative to expand mobile coverage and improve connectivity, resilience and affordability. The initiative would build on existing programs, including the Mobile Black Spot Program and the Regional Connectivity Program, to expand regional mobile coverage. Kylie Stretton said she was a realist when it came to negotiating inconsistencies in telecommunications standards from her cattle station north of Charters Towers in north Queensland. She said she advocated for rural connectivity literacy instead. ""We really need to have some efficient pinpointed initiatives out there that help people understand their connectivity more, we need a lot of people on the ground that understand where people are living,"" she said. ""You can spend all the money in the world on infrastructure, but unless you match that funding with connectivity literacy funding, nothing is going to change.""

65,"ASX jumps after Wall Street rebounds, Andrew Forrest takes back top job at Fortescue",business,"  ASX jumps after Wall Street rebounds, Andrew Forrest takes back top job at Fortescue Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Mining and tech stocks boosted the Australian share market on Wednesday, as it lifted for a fourth straight day, following a strong rebound on Wall Street. The ASX 200 closed 1 per cent higher, at 7,183 points. The Australian dollar initially slipped, after the ABS released its latest wage growth data — which showed that, in the March quarter, Australian workers received a 2.4 per cent pay rise over the year. It fell below economists' expectations of a 2.5 per cent annual wage increase. By 4:15pm (local time), the local currency had recovered to 70.3 US cents. Overnight, the broad rally on US stock markets came after weeks of heavy selling that last week saw the S&P 500 sink to its lowest level since March 2021 and the Nasdaq tumble into a bear market. Recently punished shares of Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and Amazon rose between 2 and 5.1 per cent, driving the S&P and Nasdaq higher. The S&P 500 climbed 2 per cent to finish the session at 4,089 points. The Nasdaq closed 2.8 per cent higher, at 11,985 points, while the Dow Jones lifted 1.3 per cent to 32,655. Fortescue Metals' founder Andrew Forrest will take up a more 'hands on' role at his company, as part of a wide-ranging shake-up of its leadership team. As executive chairman, the mining billionaire will lead the company's iron ore business again, for the first time in more than a decade. Dr Forrest will temporarily replace outgoing chief executive Elizabeth Gaines, who announced her intention to retire from the top leadership role in December, until a permanent replacement is found. Ms Gaines will remain on the Fortescue board, and become the ""global brand ambassador"" of the company's green energy business, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI). Former General Electric executive Mark Hutchinson will become FFI’s new CEO. The former CEO of AGL Energy, Andrew Vesey, has been appointed as FFI's head of energy transition projects. Guy Debelle, the Former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, will take up the role of FFI chief financial officer in June. The local share market was boosted by shares of mining giants BHP (+3.2pc), Rio Tinto (+2.1pc) and Fortescue Metals (+2pc). The argument that wages will grow when unemployment is lower is refuted in a new report by some of Australia's leading industrial relations experts. Small mining companies posted even larger gains, like Champion Iron (+5.3pc), South32 (+5.2pc), Liontown Resources (+2.4pc) and OZ Minerals (+3.9pc). Meanwhile, Boral's share price dropped 3.1 per cent, after the building materials maker flagged that its annual profit may come in nearly a third below expectations. In March, the Sydney-listed company warned that heavy rain across Australia's east coast, where most of the population lives, would hurt sales volumes. At the time, it forecast a pre-tax profit of $145 million to $155 million for the year to June (up from $140 million the previous year). But in a statement to the ASX today, Boral said trading since then had been ""impacted by continuing exceptional rainfall and inflationary cost pressures"" and it now expected ""additional adverse impacts"" to annual profit of about $45 million. The US stock rally was partially a reaction to overselling after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 last week posted their sixth consecutive weekly loss, Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial, said. ""There's this battle in the stock market between what breaks first — inflation or the consumer. ""The stock market is betting that the consumer is going to break and credit markets are betting that inflation is going to break first. ""The stock market is getting close to overcorrecting and pricing in the probability of a recession that I think is just too high."" Debate is raging about what is a fair wage increase that will not send businesses broke and consumer prices soaring. The S&P 500 Banks index jumped 3.8 per cent, with Citigroup climbing almost 8 per cent, after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a nearly $US3 billion investment in the US lender. Walmart tumbled 11.4 per cent, after the retail giant cut its annual profit forecast, signalling a hit to its margins. That marked the biggest one-day percentage drop for Walmart's stock since 1987. A positive March-quarter earnings season has been overshadowed by worries about the conflict in Ukraine, soaring inflation, COVID-19 lockdowns in China and aggressive policy tightening by central banks. Investors were also buoyed by data showing US retail sales increased 0.9 per cent in April as consumers dined out at restaurants more often and bought motor vehicles amid an improvement in supply. After hitting seven-week highs, oil prices tumbled overnight as Reuters reported that the United States could ease some restrictions on Venezuela's government, raising hopes that the market could see some additional supplies. Prices also fell after US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned the economy could be hurt by attempts to reduce inflation. Brent crude dropped 1.3 per cent, to $US112.77 a barrel. Spot gold was steady at $US1,814.53 an ounce.

66,"What's the price of a 'smaller fall in real wages'? About 9 cents per coffee, this report estimates",business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The headlines have been frightening. They warn that consumers may have to pay $7 for a coffee and $3 for a litre of unleaded petrol by year's end. While these predictions are largely due to factors such as high shipping costs and international movements in the price of oil, political debate in recent weeks has shifted to what impact a lift in the pay packets of workers could have on the costs of everyday goods and services. Business groups and some of our political leaders have been suggesting that if the minimum wage rises by about 5 per cent, to keep in line with the soaring cost of living, that will in turn result in far higher prices for everyday goods and services. Labor leader Anthony Albanese backed a pay rise of 5.1 per cent to keep up with inflation, saying without it, it will result in an effective pay cut for those on the minimum wage. ""What we are talking about here is the lowest-paid workers in Australia … workers who are paid $20.33 an hour, to be paid $1 extra. That is what this debate is about,"" Mr Albanese said. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison has argued that would hurt the economy, as an increase of that magnitude could send the economy into an inflationary spiral. On Tuesday, speaking about the party's plan to allow first home buyers to draw superannuation to buy homes, Mr Morrison told reporters ""wage rises are good things and we want to see the wage rises occur"", but added that should be ""on a sustainable basis"" and the best way for that to happen was to get unemployment down and ensure the economy grows. A new report by The Australia Institute being released today aims to put an actual figure on how much those goods and services could rise under a 5 per cent lift in wages. It suggests that boosting workers' wages by 5 per cent — for all workers, not just those on the minimum wage ——would lead to an increase in prices across the economy of about 2 per cent. This would mean a 5 per cent wage increase could mean a $4 cup of coffee should only increase by about 9 cents. ""There is just no way that a 5 per cent increase in all wages, let alone a 5 per cent increase in the minimum wage alone, can lead to price increases of anything like 5 per cent,"" says one of the report's authors, The Australia Institute's chief economist Richard Denniss. He argues that businesses are exaggerating the impact of wage rises on their costs as an excuse to boost profits. ""Inflation in Australia is more at risk from a profit grab than it is from a wage breakout, and it's irresponsible that so many firms would be using small wage increases to justify big increases in their profit margin,"" Dr Dennnis says. The report suggests that wages account for about 25 per cent of business costs in Australia, which means that for an average firm, a 5 per cent increase in their total wages bill would only push up costs by 1.3 per cent. Even in relatively labour-intensive industries like retail, wages only account for 38.8 per cent of total costs, meaning a 5 per cent increase in all retail wages would see costs rise by only 1.9 per cent. And since wages account for only 35 per cent of the food and beverage service industry, a $4 coffee would only need to rise by 9 cents to cover increased wages. ""Our analysis shows that even if all workers got a wage rise of 5 per cent, it would lead to a small increase in inflation that is below the RBA target range and, of course, if the wage rise was restricted to those on the minimum wage, the impact on costs would be much smaller still,"" Dr Denniss says. He said the analysis likely overstates the impact of a wage rise on costs for a number of reasons including that ""we ignore the benefits to employers of labour productivity growth, which lowers labour costs by over 1 per cent per year, and we assume that all of the increased prices in the supply chain happen instantly rather than being spread out over the next few years."" But the report shows the inflationary impact is higher for the most labour-intensive industries like education, healthcare and residential care. ACTU Secretary Sally McManus says they will fight for a 5.5 per cent wage increase at the Annual Wage Review hearing at the Fair Work Commission today. She says this increase is essential for boosting the wages of 1 in 4 workers who rely on the review for wage growth, and would lift the Adult Minimum Wage from $20.33 to $21.45 per hour, $772.60 to $815.09 per week and $40,175.20 to $42,384.84 a year. ""Minimum wage workers spend every dollar they earn, and avoiding ongoing real pay cuts is essential for ensuring workers keep money flowing into small businesses,"" she said. On Wednesday the ABS released its latest wage price index data, and in June the Fair Work Commission will release its minimum wage decision. Most economists had correctly predicted a lift in the quarterly and annual figure, and did not expect it would be so high that it would force the Reserve Bank to hike rates more aggressively than expected. The argument that wages will grow when unemployment is lower is refuted in a new report by some of Australia's leading industrial relations experts. ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch says there are huge economic benefits in ensuring that those on low wages do not see their wages fall by as much as they would without a solid increase in the minimum wage. ""If there was the 5.1 per cent increase in the minimum wage that Mr Albanese has been talking about, there would be some inflationary effects, but the increase in inflation would be smaller than increase in nominal wages [that is the increase without adjusting for inflation],"" she says. ""The key point is that with a minimum wage increase, you would see a smaller fall in real wages than you would otherwise."" ANZ forecast that by the end of the year, wages will have hit 3.5 per cent and by next year, 4 per cent, which will have some inflationary impact. They are factoring in the Reserve Bank will hike rates to 2.25 per cent by May next year. Debate is raging about what is a fair wage increase that will not send businesses broke and consumer prices soaring. Barrenjoey Capital Partners chief economist Jo Masters says they are sticking to their expectations that the Reserve Bank will hike rates by 25 basis points in June, which would lift the cash rate from 0.35 to 0.60 per cent. Ms Masters argues the issue is if real wages rise but productivity does not. ""Wages flow through to inflation in two ways,"" she says. ""The first one is directly. We know that for market services items — things like hairdressing, vets, dry-cleaning and haircuts — those wages form a large portion of the costs. And so, when you get wages growth, if it's not offset from productivity gains then those businesses need to increase prices. ""The second impact is that when you get high wage growth, consumers have greater spending power and it boosts activity in the economy. People are spending more. And you get inflation where demand is outstripping supply."" ""At the moment, supply is disrupted by global events including a supply chain distortion. But weak productivity growth means you're not boosting the supply side of the economy. Basically, for a business, if productivity is running as fast as wage growth, it's not as inflationary."" ""Productivity is notoriously difficult to measure but for the past 5 to 10 years, Australia has had very weak productivity growth."" Ms Masters says during the pandemic, Australian businesses were not able to pass on price increases. ""An ABS survey released last week found that 50 per cent of firms that [saw an] increase in output costs had passed on some or all of that,"" she says. But she said Wednesday's wages data is not likely to show the full impact of pay rises across the economy but that the September quarter data, which will account for the minimum wage increase, will.

67,"'Hereditary housing', mega inheritances and tax tweaks are breaking the 'intergenerational bargain', experts warn",business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Younger people are stuck in a tax system that some economists warn is stacked against them, as election promises that give advantages to wealthy, retired baby boomers over wage earners mount. ""We've had a tax and transfer system that's radically benefited current older Australians throughout their lifetimes,"" Steven Hamilton of George Washington University says. ""We're seeing further giveaways to older Australians, often quite wealthy, older Australians,"" Brendan Coates of the Grattan Institute adds. ""Essentially the intergenerational bargain is starting to fray."" ""We've reduced social mobility,"" Emma Dawson of think-tank Per Capita concludes. ""Australia prided itself on that sense of the 'fair go', of being an egalitarian nation, more so than just about anywhere else in the world … we've destroyed that in the space of a generation."" Things don't feel fair to River Pearson, a 28-year-old living on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. ""It is definitely harder to get ahead with the way things are,"" she says, having just unpacked her car after a long shift of cleaning. ""It is going to be harder than the past generations had it. And I think we get cut a lot. ""We get a lot of bad rap for seeing that and thinking that. But that's just how it is right now."" John Feehan has great sympathy. Aged 68, he is a self-funded retiree living 80 kilometres east in Drouin, in West Gippsland. ""We were just so blessed. We even had the best music, I think,"" he laughs. ""The baby boomers just landed on their feet, and we've been so rapacious, we've been just terrible."" There are inequalities within generations. For example, women aged 55 and over are the fastest-growing group of homeless people. But a diverse group of experts agree that a storm of global factors and policy choices has generally seen older Australians benefit, as young people's futures suffer. Interest rates are rising to take money out of our hands. So why are stage 3 tax cuts still on the table? asks Peter Martin. A long, astonishing rise in house prices in a time of record-low interest rates has led to a massive growth in wealth for people who got in before the boom. The stock market, too, has powered ahead. Wage growth has been stubbornly low. Combined with rising inflation, that means people's purchasing power, what they can buy with their money, is becoming weaker. Workers are shouldering a growing share of the tax burden, and tax cuts set to arrive will give the most back to those at the top of the income tree. Meanwhile, older and wealthier Australians are benefiting from decisions that cost taxpayers billions: Some super concessions and the CGT discount are available to people of any age, but researchers suggest the bulk of the benefits go to older and wealthier Australians. Superannuation concessions reduce the tax paid on funds in what is meant to be a retirement nest egg but is also used for intergenerational wealth transfer. You can earn up to $250,000 a year and contributions into your super are taxed at 15 per cent, as opposed to the top tax rate, which is currently 45 per cent. Once you retire, you can have $1.7 million in a super account — $3.4 million for couples – and not pay any tax on your earnings. The money was taxed once — when it was earned. But this concession means current wage earners are subsidising some of the richest people in the country to not pay tax on their investment income. Treasury produces an intergenerational report about every five years, projecting what Australia will look like. It suggests that by 2040 the cost of the concessions will dwarf what we spend on the age pension. The cost is already far more than double what Australia spends on unemployment benefits. ""That looks like being unsustainable,"" says Steven Hamilton, a tax economist at George Washington University and a visiting fellow at the Tax and Transfer Policy Institute at the ANU. One of the issues with intergenerational inequalities is that most people are lucky enough to get old. ""So if older people are benefiting more than younger people, by the end of their lifetime everything should work out, right?"" With less than a week to go before the nation heads to the polls, the two main parties are locked in a battle over pretty much nothing. Until recently, Mr Hamilton was the chief economist at the Blueprint Institute think tank, which has several prominent Liberals and a former NSW Nationals MP on its strategic council. He sees the issue being that changes in policy settings ""so that one generation wins, and the next generation loses"" are distorting the overall picture. ""Well, I don't have a lot of hair,"" he laughs, ""but I'm a young person. And I would very much like to see a greater level of equality within each generation. ""I think we've got to fix these problems."" For Emma Dawson, executive director of left-leaning think-tank Per Capita, the ""real culprits"" are tax concessions that go to people who already have a lot of wealth, primarily around property. At the 2019 election, the concept of negative gearing — allowing property investors to deduct losses from being a landlord against their tax — was much debated. Less discussed is the impact of a discount to capital gains tax (CGT) on property investment — something that exploded at the turn of the century. ""At that point, we saw the price of property, of land, in Australia take off compared to the rate of wage growth,"" Ms Dawson says. ""People were encouraged to chase a capital gain, knowing the money they were making from the income in that investment was going to be taxed more lightly than the income from their work."" A nation that once prided itself on its egalitarianism and its high levels of home ownership is experiencing rising inequality, due to a growing chasm of wealth between those who own homes, and those who never will, writes Stephen Long. Research conducted for the Australia Institute found the concession cost $9.3 billion (super tax concessions topped $41 billion). The amount of CGT discount claimed by high-income households was 87 per cent of that. Middle-income households used 11 per cent, and low-income households just 1 per cent. ""We don't tax wealth, we are over-reliant on taxing incomes, which stifles innovation and it also stifles people's ability to get ahead,"" says Ms Dawson, who withdrew from a Labor preselection process after the Coalition proposed tax cuts for wealthy people and the opposition did not oppose it. ""So we have a lot of older people that are extremely 'asset rich' — they're not paying a lot of tax on that wealth, on the income from their investments — and younger people, who only have income from work, being taxed relatively highly compared to the rest of the world, and [are] unable to get into the market to accumulate some assets."" Another election promise sees the expansion of eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC). More than 400,000 people aged over 67 who do not qualify for the aged pension get the card, giving them access to cheaper Medicare services and prescription medicines. With Labor matching the promise, it means a person earning up to $90,000 a year ($144,000 for couples) will get what used to be restricted to singles earning up to $58,000 annually ($92,000 for couples). ""What we're doing is we're giving cheaper medicines, cheaper doctor appointments to people who are essentially earning amongst the wealthiest 5 per cent of older Australians,"" says Brendan Coates of the Grattan Institute. ""They have average wealth, outside of their home, of $1.5 million. ""So we are talking about extending these benefits to some of the wealthiest in our society, while at the same time we're struggling to find the money to pay for support for people who are vulnerable, who are on low incomes and who are really struggling."" In Australia, savings are taxed relatively lightly, giving bigger benefits to older people who have accumulated more over the course of their working lives. That is leading to problems, Mr Coates says. ""These are policies that see someone who's older, over the age of 65, paying the same tax if they earn $100,000 as a younger person who earns $50,000. You know, that is not equitable."" As the large baby boomer cohort gets older, there is likely to be a growing wave of wealth transfer through inheritances. But far from ending inequality, some experts are concerned it will cement it. Death and tax are the two certainties in life, so why not combine them? ""It'll turbocharge inequality,"" Ms Dawson warns. ""Because what we'll see is those families that already have some capital passing it down to their own children, and those that don't have any capital will be even less able to get into the market. ""So we'll be creating effectively a two-tier society again."" More than $120 billion was passed on in 2018, before the pandemic (the entire health budget that year was $80 billion). Mr Hamilton says that, while inheritance may address some inequality between young and old, it ""doesn't address inequality within a generation between the haves and the have nots"". River Pearson isn't angry about older generations. She lives with her grandfather, who she describes as ""my best friend"", and appreciates that people who've worked a lifetime deserve a good retirement. But as she considers buying property, she feels the cards are stacked against her. ""It's daunting, it's actually very daunting to think of because it's such a hard thing to achieve these days in my age bracket with the cost of living going up and wages staying the same,"" she says. ""And it's only going to get worse if it continues to rise."" John Feehan worked in the dairy industry and never reset his body clock. Rising about quarter to three in the morning, he hits the gym for several hours before most people are awake. He thinks about the lives of his children, and those of his partner's. ""I think it's harder for them,"" he says. ""I just walked into a factory, looking for a job, and 20 years later I was still there. We were the lucky generation."" ""I just think we're so greedy, we don't like to share. ""Maybe [dealing with] climate change might impinge on our portfolio, or it might cost us a little bit more to address it, but we just avoid those things. We don't … want anything to change that might hurt us."" The big problem, Emma Dawson says, is that when you make structural changes to any system — like the way we tax or give benefits — there are winners and losers. When you're trying to win the most votes in an election, that's tough. ""No-one wants there to be any losers, but there has to be in this in this game,"" she says. ""They may lose a little bit of wealth in order to allow other people to build some security. And I think that's a trade-off most Australians would be willing to make."" Policymakers put Australia on the path to ""landlordism"" years ago, and it destroyed the Australian dream. Mr Coates calls it a ""unity ticket"" from the Coalition and Labor: ""pushing more benefits towards older Australians, often wealthier, older Australians"". He argues that taking the intergenerational challenge seriously would involve increased rent assistance for young people and a winding back of concessions so that older people don't pay so much less tax than younger people on the same incomes. ""We're not seeing those kinds of policies this election campaign, essentially, because both major parties are worried about pissing off older Australians,"" he says. ""They're worried about pissing off older Australians and losing the election.""

68,Push for all workers to get 10 days' paid family and domestic violence leave ,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Unions and advocates are calling on the next federal government to give all workers access to 10 days' paid and family violence leave, after the Fair Work Commission's landmark in-principle decision on the issue. The Fair Work Commission gave its in-principle support to vary the awards for around 2.3 million workers to include annual entitlements of 10 days' paid family and domestic violence (FDV) leave. ""Paid FDV leave provides significant assistance to those experiencing FDV,"" the full bench of the commission concluded in its historic decision handed down on Monday. ""Such leave helps individuals to maintain their economic security; to access relevant services, and to safely exit to a life free from violence."" Currently, workers are only entitled to five days of unpaid leave. In a rejection of concerns put forward by business groups, the commission said take-up of the 10 days' paid FDV leave entitlement would likely be low, ""which suggests that such costs are unlikely to be substantial"". ""Employers are already paying the cost of FDV – through increased absenteeism and lost productivity. Paid FDV leave will assist in reducing that cost,"" the FWC said. The provisional decision applies to full-time and part-time employees. But the FWC rejected the Australian Council of Trade Unions' push for paid FDV leave to apply to casuals. That's despite the FWC outlining in its decision that women who experience family and domestic violence have a more disrupted work history and were more likely to be employed on a casual or part-time basis than women with no experience of violence. Advocates and unions are calling for paid family and domestic violence leave to be extended to all employees,  including casuals and contractors. ""Many women are in low-paid and insecure work,"" Women's Legal Service New South Wales chief executive Helen Campbell said. ""We know that financial security is very important to contributing to a pathway to safety."" Dr Kate Seymour, senior lecturer in Social Work at Flinders University, said it was a critical gap. ""Increasingly, work is insecure and that has implications across the board,"" she said. ""As significant as Fair Work's decision is as a recognition of the scale of family and domestic violence, the hope is it would be extended to more people."" The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has also called on the next federal government to extend paid family and domestic violence leave to all workers covered by the National Employment Standards (NES). The NES covers an additional 8.4 million workers. “Already this year, 18 women have been killed by their current or previous partner. Access to paid family and domestic violence leave saves lives. No worker should ever have to choose between their income and their safety,"" ACTU president Michele O'Neill said. “The difference between this entitlement being in the award system and the NES cannot be overstated. Failing to include it in the NES would deny access to millions of working people."" Labor has previously said it supported 10 days' paid leave but did not meet the ABC's deadline to provide further details on the party's policy. The Coalition has previously voted against Labor's push in the Senate to include 10 days' paid leave because it said the Fair Work Commission was looking at the matter. In a statement, a spokesman for Industrial Relations Minister Michaelia Cash welcomed the FWC's decision. ""We will consult with relevant stakeholders, especially family and domestic violence advocacy groups and small business employers, on its implications,"" the statement said. ""If re-elected, we will make a submission to the Fair Work Commission in accordance with the process set out by the Fair Work Commission."" Domestic and family violence leads to staff absenteeism and lower productivity and the estimated cost to business is about $2 billion annually, a new report shows. Many major employers already offer 10 days of paid leave for people experiencing family and domestic violence. The Australian Industry Group (AiGroup), which has previously called for paid family and domestic leave to be subsidised by the federal government at the minimum wage, said it would consult with its members and make further submissions to the FWC. ""The commission has made a finding that the cost impact on employers is unlikely to be substantial due to the likely low employee rate of access to the entitlement,"" AiGroup chief executive Innes Willox said. The Master Grocers' Association (MGA) said requiring employers to pay 10 days of family and domestic violence leave would act as a ""disincentive for hiring women"". ""Every time there is another regulation or cost burden, it absolutely gives employers another reason not to employ a staff member,"" MGA chief executive Jos de Bruin said. ""There is plenty of existing leave a staff member can access … We can't afford it."" The Fair Work Commission will accept further submissions and hand down its draft directions on July 1.

69,Inflation and supply chain disruption pushes farmers to look into alternative fertilisers,business," ABC Rural Soil health in focus as fertiliser prices soar and farmers look for alternatives Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Farmers across the country are looking for alternatives to synthetic fertiliser as prices continue to soar. Good compost can kickstart microbial growth and aerate poor soil Biosolids increase yields without chemical fertiliser but don't increase soil carbon An overfocus on yield over long-term sustainability has led to depleted soils But some farmers have left chemical fertilisers behind, pursuing more sustainable methods, both economically and ecologically. Rhonda Daly and her husband Bill have built compost company YLad Living Soils near Young in the south-west slopes of New South Wales. The investment in compost has significantly reduced her reliance on chemical inputs over the past 20 years. ""It's really about having a paradigm shift as to how you treat the soil."" A growing number of farmers have moved away from industrialised agriculture, instead treating soil as part of a living system they manage. ""We have burned out the organic matter … through [industrial] farming methods,"" Ms Daly said. ""We've depleted the microbial diversity in our soils, so the soil goes from a fluffy chocolate cake to a terracotta tile and when you're dealing with terracotta tiles, that's when you have to have more inputs, because nature's not really working."" In addition to improving soil fertility, fertiliser alternatives have now become more cost effective as continued supply chain disruption and China's export ban have sent fertiliser prices soaring. The Dalys have been using humus compost, which they make and sell on-farm using local organic waste. ""Humus is the final product of the composting process where the organic matter that has been broken down and then it's microbially built-up into long molecular chains, which is active carbon,"" Ms Daly said. Merino sheep farmer Gordon Nash turned to biosolids about 15 years ago on his property outside Bathurst. A groundbreaking trial which started 20 years ago fertilising Queensland cotton farms with treated human sewage has become so popular more than 100 farmers are now on the waiting list. Biosolids are the by-product of sewage treatment plants and have been supplied to a small number of farms for the past two decades. ""[With] soils out here quite shallow and poor, it's been chalk and cheese [with] what you can do with synthetic versus organic fertiliser,"" Mr Nash said. Mr Nash's neighbour, John Toole started using biosolids after seeing how productive his pastures were. He saw his productivity increase by 50 per cent. ""There is no comparison whatsoever, bang for buck. Certainly the biosolids are more expensive first up, but the results are unbelievable,"" Mr Toole said. Justin Borevitz, an expert in soil sciences at the Australian National University, said there doesn't need to be a ""war on chemicals"" to keep soil healthy. Chemical fertilisers are still needed when crops are not getting enough nitrogen or other nutrients. ""The advantage of biologicals is that it breaks down slowly in the soil. And so it releases that nitrogen over time, especially as the plants get bigger,"" Dr Borevitz said. Organic fertilisers also penetrate deeper into the soil, reaching and strengthening root systems. But not all organic fertilisers are created equal. ""Biosolids are part of the solution when used right, because in the worst case it just burps out methane or nitrous oxide and bad compost can be really bad for the environment too,"" Dr Borevitz said. Piggeries and feedlots are examples of bad compost as they release as much methane as the animals do. Another downside is that biosolids have to be chemically processed at a plant and then carefully spread, while compost is not readily available in large quantities for commercial farming. But Dr Borevitz said farmers could invest in industrial equipment: a biochar machine, a rock-crushing machine, or a compost churner. A composting set-up like that could remineralise soil, increase soil carbon and keep the system healthy enough to sustain more crops long-term. ""But, none of these are a silver bullet by any means,"" Dr Borevitz said.

70,Borrowers narrowly escaped a bigger rate rise in May and may not be so lucky next month,business,"  Reserve Bank minutes show a bigger interest rate rise was considered in May, still possible in June Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Minutes from the Reserve Bank's last meeting show borrowers may only have narrowly escaped a bigger rate rise and should brace for the chance of a super-sized move in June. Most economists had expected the RBA to raise rates by 15 basis points at its May meeting, while a few had tipped a 40-basis-point rate hike and a couple expected it to wait until June for its first move. However, the Reserve Bank caught everyone off-guard by lifting rates by 25 basis points. It seems that either no move or a 15-basis-point rise were barely even on the agenda at the May 3 meeting. ""Members considered three options for the size of the rate increase at the present meeting: raising the cash rate by 15 basis points, 25 basis points or 40 basis points,"" the minutes noted. ""Members agreed that raising the cash rate by 15 basis points was not the preferred option given that policy was very stimulatory and that it was highly probable that further rate rises would be required. ""A 15-basis-point increase would also be inconsistent with the historical practice of changing the cash rate in increments of at least 25 basis points. ""An argument for an increase of 40 basis points could be made given the upside risks to inflation and the current very low level of interest rates. ""However, members agreed that the preferred option was 25 basis points. A move of this size would help signal that the board was now returning to normal operating procedures after the extraordinary period of the pandemic."" Our latest burst of inflation is weird, and resistant to rate hikes. But if the Reserve Bank isn't careful, too many more rate hikes like this might help bring on a recession. The fact that a 40-basis-point rise was seriously considered has many economists speculating that it could happen in June, especially if Wednesday's Wage Price Index numbers are higher than the 2.5 per cent annual growth most economists are currently expecting. ""The mere discussion of a 40-basis-point move means it cannot be ruled out, particularly if, once again, data surprises on the upside,"" argued CBA's Belinda Allen. ""We think an upward surprise of 1 per cent quarter-on-quarter growth in tomorrow's Wage Price Index (WPI) could be enough to get the RBA over the line for 40 basis points, though if it comes in at our forecast of 0.8 per cent quarter-on-quarter, that prospect will recede,"" noted ANZ's head of Australian economics David Plank. While the Reserve Bank generally avoids giving any exact forecasts or guidance on the future path of interest rates, it did reveal the assumptions underpinning its latest economic forecasts. The RBA's economists assumed the cash rate would reach 1.75 per cent by the end of this year and 2.5 per cent by the end of 2023 in arriving at its forecast that inflation would fall back within the bank's target range of 2-3 per cent by mid-2024. Those assumptions were derived from a combination of economist forecasts and market pricing. However, many experts do not expect interest rates to rise that high, including the Commonwealth Bank's economics team. ""Our overall view is that the interest rate will go up to about 1.6 per cent,"" the bank's chief executive, Matt Comyn, told The Business. ""So, less than many other commentators or even the market is predicting at the moment. ""I think that would have a modest impact on the totality of our 2 million customers who have got a home loan."" Mr Comyn said his bank had been testing new mortgage applicants to ensure they could meet repayments if mortgage rates rose to at least 5.25 per cent. Why would the Reserve Bank add increased interest costs to household budgets at a time when Australians are struggling with a surging cost of living? Michael Janda explains the economics behind it. The RBA has copped criticism about its previous guidance around interest rates, which some have argued led a portion of borrowers to take on loans based on those expectations of ultra-low interest rates for at least the next couple of years. But it was keen to point out that it was not the only central bank to publicly forecast that rates would likely not rise before 2024, only to have to raise them this year. ""Members noted that [Sweden's] Sveriges Riksbank had increased its policy rate by 25 basis points, in response to higher-than-expected inflation, having indicated as recently as February that it did not expect to increase its policy rate until at least 2024,"" the minutes noted.

71,"Ferry terminals to reopen across Brisbane, 90 days after floodwaters pulled debris through the city's centre",business,"  Brisbane CityCat, ferry services to resume after 2022 river flooding events Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Most of Brisbane's ferry services will be back in action from Thursday, some 90 days after the city endured its latest major flood event, although a third of its terminals still require repairs. In February, days of heavy rain sent tonnes of debris down the Brisbane River, including some private pontoons that caused damage to the city's ferry terminals. From Thursday, 13 terminals between Northshore Hamilton and Guyatt Park, St Lucia, would begin operating again. ""Just over 90 days ago, Brisbane experienced its biggest-ever rain event and our ferry terminals were impacted by debris and floodwaters,"" Brisbane City Council Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said. ""Last week's rain event caused a brief delay to our plans but from Thursday we will have 13 terminals back up and operating, which is a fantastic result. ""Importantly, this will include terminals like Riverside and South Bank, which means residents will be able to commute on the river again."" Under a temporary timetable, the Bulimba to Teneriffe cross-river service would continue on a 15-minute frequency. The end-to-end CityCat service would operate every 15 minutes, and CityHopper services would run in 30-minute intervals between South Bank, Riverside and Howard Smith Wharves. With the commencement of other CityCat services, the temporary Guyatt Park to West End cross-river and Hawthorne cross-river services would cease. Mr Schrinner said the more regular CityCat and CityHopper operations would return after being suspended last week following advice from Maritime Safety Queensland about debris in the river. He said the council worked with specialist teams and equipment to repair the damage to the ferry network. Councillor and transport committee chairman Ryan Murphy said the University of Queensland, Queensland University of Technology, Milton and Regatta terminals had sustained ""moderate damage"" and would not reopen until at least October. Four other terminals sustained ""more minor damage"" and would open in ""coming weeks and months"". Those terminals were Maritime, Holman Street, Sydney Street and North Quay. Mr Murphy said a repair schedule for the eight remaining terminals was being finalised. ""These terminals are in some of the most challenging locations on the river,"" he said. ""While work has been done to remove or re-attach the gangway at these terminals, some further repair works are required before we can safely reopen them to the public. ""Some terminals did experience more damage than others and the Regatta and North Quay terminals will continue to remain out of action due to damage to both the gangway and land-based infrastructure from significant flood debris. ""We are committed to returning our ferry network in its entirety as soon as possible and thank residents for their patience.""

72,Elon Musk says Twitter deal 'cannot move forward' without proof of fake accounts,business,"  Tesla CEO Elon Musk says Twitter deal cannot move forward, claims 20 per cent of all accounts are fake Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his deal to buy Twitter can not move forward unless the company shows public proof that less than 5 per cent of the accounts on the social media platform are fake or spam. Mr Musk made the comment in a reply to another user on Twitter early on Tuesday local time. He spent much of the previous day in a back-and-forth with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who posted a series of tweets explaining his company's effort to fight bots and how it has consistently estimated that less than 5 per cent of Twitter accounts are fake. In his tweet on Tuesday, Mr Musk said that ""20 per cent fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter's SEC filings being accurate."" He added: ""Yesterday, Twitter's CEO publicly refused to show proof of 5 per cent. This deal cannot move forward until he does."" Twitter declined to comment. ""You can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed,"" he said at a conference in Miami. On Friday, Mr Musk said his $US44 billion ($61.4 billion) deal to buy Twitter was on hold pending information on spam accounts. He said he suspects fake accounts make up at least 20 per cent of all users on the site — compared to Twitter's official estimate of 5 per cent. When asked at the All-In Summit conference whether the Twitter deal is viable at a different price, Mr Musk responded: ""I mean, it's not out of the question."" ""The more questions I ask, the more my concerns grow,"" he said. ""They claim that they've got this complex methodology that only they can understand. ""It can't be some deep mystery that is, like, more complex than the human soul or something like that."" Twitter shares extended losses in late afternoon trading after Mr Musk's comments. The stock dropped more than 8 per cent to close at $US37.39 ($53.44), lower than the day before Mr Musk revealed his Twitter stake in early April, sparking doubts that the billionaire entrepreneur would proceed with his acquisition of the company at the agreed price. Earlier, the Twitter chief executive officer tweeted that internal estimates of spam accounts on the social media platform for the last four quarters were ""well under 5 per cent,"" responding to days of criticism by Mr Musk of the company's handling of phoney accounts. Twitter's estimate, which has stayed the same since 2013, could not be reproduced externally given the need to use both public and private information to determine whether an account is spam, he added. Mr Musk responded to Mr Agrawal's defence of the company's methodology with a poop emoji. ""So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,"" Mr Musk wrote. Mr Musk has pledged changes to Twitter's content moderation practices, railing against decisions like the company's ban of former US president Donald Trump as overly aggressive while pledging to crack down on ""spambots"" on the platform. Mr Musk has called for tests of random samples of Twitter users to identify bots. He also said, ""there is some chance it might be over 90 per cent of daily active users."" Elon Musk says he will allow Donald Trump to return to the social media platform if he follows through with his plan to buy it. Independent researchers have estimated that anywhere from 9 per cent to 15 per cent of the millions of Twitter profiles are bots. Twitter does not currently require users to register using their real identities and expressly permits automated, parody and pseudonymous profiles on the service. It does ban impersonation and spam and penalises accounts when the company determines their purpose is to ""deceive or manipulate others"" by engaging in scams, coordinating abuse campaigns or artificially inflating engagement. Mr Musk's comments to a private audience could add to concerns about his disclosures of market-moving information. The Tesla CEO, known for his candid Twitter posts, has a long history of skirmishes with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Recently, Mr Musk was criticised by a US judge for trying to escape a settlement with the SEC requiring oversight of his Tesla tweets.

73,Alive and kicking: How footy and tourism have helped breathe life back into a border town after almost two years of restrictions,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A business owner in a border community has hailed tourists and sport as the key factors for breathing life back into the town after almost two years of border restrictions. Next week marks six months since travel restrictions between South Australia and Victoria lifted entirely. Casterton lies about 40 kilometres from the border on the Victorian side. Residents were heavily affected by border restrictions, at times being unable to cross for work or school, medical appointments, or to access groceries or fuel. Owner of Element Cafe and Larder in Casterton Troy Robbins said the border restrictions had been ""challenging"". ""It was very hard for us to get over the border with the restrictions that were in place, especially for an essential business to try and get supplies,"" Mr Robbins said. ""One of the biggest costs for us here is getting stuff freighted in, so if we can drive over to Mount Gambier and get it, then we do."" Mr Robbins said positivity in the town was coming back as travellers returned. ""It has been pretty busy,"" he said. ""We get a bit of traffic for coffee. ""It's more consistent now than what it was 12 months ago and what it was six months ago."" Casterton is the only Victorian club to play in the Western Border Football and Netball League. The teams are now able to travel into South Australia for games after two disrupted seasons. People travelling into SA are no longer required to get tested for COVID-19. Mr Robbins said locals missed community sport during the height of the pandemic. ""Footy brings out the best in people,"" he said. ""Every second week, there's a team from over the border [that] comes here. ""We get a lot of support from them. ""They're a great support to our business and small businesses in town,"" Mr Robbins said. Pat Gill from Casterton Farm Supplies said business was booming. ""We're getting good prices … Business is good,"" he said. Glenelg Shire Councillor Karen Stephens said the community had ""always been very resilient"". She said many businesses had learnt to change tact to survive throughout COVID. ""I've seen quite a few of the businesses redesign themselves and focus on how they can improve their services because of COVID,"" Ms Stephens said. ""The retail sector did it extremely tough. ""The first 12 months was tough enough, but the second 12 months was even tougher for them."" ""I think they're so brave to continue on and now get back on their feet."" Ms Stephens said the community was bouncing back but many people have ""changed their patterns"". ""Maybe they don't zip across the border as quickly as they used to,"" she said. ""There are still some things that remain unresolved. ""I think [border restrictions] broke down some family networks because you weren't able to see them. ""Families are now regrouping and able to have a lot more freedom to cross the border and actually spend valuable time together."" Ms Stephens said it was ""fantastic"" to see tourists supporting the town once again. ""As soon as the borders opened…we had an incredible amount of people in caravans and campers just out exploring,"" she said. ""It was fantastic to see so many families here during the three weeks of the holidays – two weeks of the Victorian [holidays] and then the extended week for the South Australians as well. ""Just to see them at the bakeries and eating in the street, and at the skate parks and the pump track and all of those sorts of things around Casterton.""

74,Are we really paying more for food? We ask the experts,business,"  Food prices to keep rising if mooted 'triple-dip' La Niña creates more chaos, say experts Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog If it seems like your grocery bill is more expensive than ever, that's because the price of food hasn't been this high since the last time Australia had back-to-back La Niña weather systems a decade ago. Now there's a chance we could be in for a rare ""triple-dip"" La Niña. That would mean a continuation of the devastating weather that has lashed Australia's east coast farming regions this year, at a time when the pandemic is still sweeping the nation and there's no end in sight to the war in Ukraine. Experts say these events have created an ""unprecedented"" confluence of both domestic and international pressures that are impacting supply chains and driving up food prices. The cost of fresh fruit and vegetables has already jumped as a result of widespread flooding in Queensland and New South Wales, and the prospect of a third La Niña could mean more disruption to the traditionally volatile market. But experts are divided on whether the La Niña weather pattern will continue, and for how long. ""The forecasts out of the US [are] … at 50/50, which I think is kind of about where everybody's sitting,"" University of Southern Queensland climate scientist Chelsea Jarvis said. Dr Jarvis said the current La Niña was likely to persist through winter. ""Usually, if a La Niña is going kind of through July and August, it'll continue through spring and into summer,"" she said. The latest March ABS inflation data showed food inflation was up 4.3 per cent compared to a year ago, with the biggest jump being in the price of fresh vegetables and meat — at  6.7 per cent and 6.2 per cent respectively. But food inflation has been higher than this before, so why is everyone suddenly talking about food prices? John Rolfe, a professor of Regional Economic Development at Central Queensland University, said that food had become relatively cheaper in developed countries over the past 30 to 40 years. As agriculture had become more efficient and Australians had become wealthier, the cost of food had not really been a big issue, he said. Until now. ""Most of the biggest inflation is occurring in things that people can't avoid,"" Professor Rolfe said. ""It's things that are essential items that are biting and because food is one of those, people are really noticing it."" The current general inflation rate of 5.1 per cent seems small compared with a record high of more than 17 per cent in the 1970s, but the difference now is that everything is getting more expensive at the same time. ""Housing and rents are really expensive now, compared to what they were back in the 1970s … so there's not as much room to move in household budgets,"" Professor Rolfe said. Inflation in the 1970s peaked at an extraordinary 17.5 per cent, and there is no easy way to compare now to then because so much has changed – we have removed protections, floated the dollar, and introduced a GST. But according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in the past 50 years, the prices of bread and cereal products have increased about tenfold, and the cost of meat is more than 12 times more expensive, and since 1989, vegetables have increased by 116 per cent. But there are dozens of different food categories, and individual prices are affected by a variety of factors. It is also very hard to quantify the costs relative to all the other factors, such as income or the price of fuel. For example, in 1972 the seasonally adjusted average weekly wage earnings of a man was $91.80, and in 2021 weekly earnings for all employees was $,1305.80, an increase generally in line with the increase in the cost of food. However, the graph below by the Reserve Bank of Australia also captures the drastic jump in house prices since then, which further complicates comparisons of food prices, because it has created financial advantage and disadvantage. And 2019 analysis shows that the cost of essential goods and services has generally risen much faster than discretionary items — putting the squeeze on household budgets. Another reason you might be noticing a jump in your grocery bill is that for the first time in about 10 years, the price of dried and packaged products has jumped significantly. Sean Smith, managing director of Frugl Limited, a digital app-based service that tracks grocery prices, said the biggest price hikes were being seen in pantry items. ""Olive oil, for example, has gone up between 30 and 50 per cent,"" he said. Source: Sean Smith, Frugl ""Instant coffee is another one which has gone up … as much as 47 per cent."" Mr Smith said the price of some basic items seemed to have been permanently raised since pandemic panic-buying saw supermarket shelves stripped bare. ""We saw the price of pasta go up 30 per cent, just purely on the basis that it was difficult and challenging for them to get,"" he said. ""But we've never seen pasta recover, it's never gone back down."" Rabobank senior analyst Michael Harvey said ""a confluence of factors"" — including high energy and oil prices — was driving up the cost of food. ""You've got cost pressures and cost headwinds across all parts of the supply chain,"" he said. ""All these events at once creating unprecedented disruption to the food system."" The CEO of Australian food manufacturer SPC, Robert Giles, told the Australian Financial Review this month that the price of staples including canned baked beans, spaghetti and tomatoes would rise by 10 to 20 per cent to recover growing input costs. Nutrition experts say opting for the cheaper forms of fruit and vegetables doesn't necessarily mean compromising on health. Food and Grocery Council chief executive Tanya Barden said between 2010 and 2020, the costs for food manufacturers went up 50 per cent, and until now output prices had only increased by 25 per cent. ""The industry's profitability had fallen from $8 billion to $5 billion, because they weren't able to pass those costs through,"" she said. ""It just shows that the cost increases coming through now can no longer be absorbed by the industry."" Global shipping costs have also soared through the pandemic, increasing between 500 and 700 per cent. Despite the higher prices, vegetable growers like Carl Walker — from near Bowen in north Queensland, a major winter vegetable production area — aren't exactly reaping the benefits. ""Across Australia we’ve seen a lessening of product coming out of areas because of lack of workers, and that’s causing a supply problem,"" Mr Walker said. Growers are dealing with a 25 per cent drop in the available workforce, and many have relied on Pacific Island workers to carry their businesses through the pandemic. With the Russian war in Ukraine ongoing and trade embargoes in place, the cost of diesel remains close to record highs. Russia is also a big global supplier of fertiliser, which will further push up input prices. Some industry insiders say that we all should be paying more for fresh food — national peak body AusVeg recently called for retailers and buyers to offer prices to farmers that reflected the current economic climate. ""Prices have gone up between 30 and 40 per cent since last year, and somehow we've got to recoup that,"" Mr Walker said. ""Unless prices do stay to a level that's actually economically viable for us going forward, you'll see producers falling on their swords because they cannot survive."" Good question, and there is no clear answer. Senior retail analyst with MST Marquee Craig Woolford said much of the price pressure was the result of the pandemic. Another dairy farmer forced to send his herd to the meatworks is calling the big supermarkets ""dirty rotten mongrel bastards"". With so many uncertain factors like war and the pandemic still playing out, food price fluctuation appears set to continue. ""The rest of this year, it's going to be quite a lot of price inflation. The second wave [is] still to come, given what's played out with Russia and Ukraine,"" Mr Woolford said. But there is some good news. There might be a silver lining for long-suffering dairy farmers, many of whom have been pushed to their limits by drought and dollar-per-litre milk prices. ""Dairy farmers are getting a record high milk price, and there's an even higher price on the horizon for the new season,"" Mr Harvey said. ""You've got a very firm global commodity market for dairy commodities, so that's great news for farmers.""

75,Do you live in one of Australia's most polluted towns?,business,"  Australia's most polluted postcodes for 2022 revealed by Australian Conservation Foundation Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The top 10 most polluted postcodes in Australia have been named by national environmental organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation. The group's analysis looked at National Pollutant Inventory emission data, collected annually from power stations, mines and manufacturing plants across the country. It focused on locations emitting the largest amounts of five pollutants: sulfur dioxide, mercury, coarse and fine particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides. Australian Conservation Foundation economy and democracy program manager Matt Rose said the data it based its conclusions on was ""not perfect"" as it only counted pollution emitted from industrial activities and not vehicle emissions in major cities. ""The database is incomplete because traffic volumes and traffic pollution is not included,"" Mr Rose said. ""Traffic pollution is definitely more of an issue but I don't think you can discount the fact that these industrial facilities are producing certain types of pollutants that you don't have from traffic pollution and people need to be aware of that."" 1. Mount Isa, Qld The most polluted city in Australia for 2022, according to the foundation's analysis, was the north-west Queensland city of Mount Isa. Home to about 20,000 people, the mining city is central to several copper, zinc, lead and silver operations across the region. There were 17 facilities in the postcode that reported pollutants of concern with Mount Isa Mines, operated by Glencore, responsible for 91 per cent of the postcode’s emissions, according to foundation's analysis. Mount Isa Mines is Australia’s biggest polluter of SO2, the foundation found. Mount Isa Mines is facing a $5m lawsuit over allegations lead poisoning caused a teenager's brain damage. A Mount Isa Lead Alliance program is run in the community, recognising the dangers of ""living with lead"". One Mount Isa mum, who did not want to be named, told the ABC she was planning to leave the city because of the pollution. ""I don't like that the sulphur goes over the schools and when you do call the mine they don't shut it off,"" she alleged. ""We are leaving because of it."" Resident Noel Rayner said it was a concerning part of living in the community, but not enough to turn him away. ""It does concern me but Mount Isa is a mining town, it's based on a mining industry, yes there is pollution, but you've just got to hope that the authorities are monitoring it and I know there are monitoring stations around town."" Mount Isa Mines operates 12 compliance air quality monitoring stations across the area, seven of which monitor heavy metals, including lead. ""Every resident of Mount Isa is within 1,200 metres of a sulphur dioxide monitor,"" Glencore said in a statement to the ABC. The Mount Isa mine in north-west Queensland is a source of ""potentially significant"" lead pollution, a report commissioned by global mining giant Glencore finds. ""Mount Isa Mines also engages openly about operations …through bi-annual Community Information Sessions, a 1800 Community Feedback Hotline and an AQMI smartphone app and real-time air quality data on the website to improve transparency of environmental performance."" Katter's Australian Party leader and Mount Isa resident, Robbie Katter, slammed the foundation's findings. ""I immediately question the validity of these statements and my mind turns to massive new housing estates that I go past in Brisbane that are pumping more people into an already concentrated area, all of whom have vehicle emissions,"" Mr Katter said. ""Im a lot more concerned about what I'm breathing in when I go to Brisbane than I am when I'm out here in Mount Isa, amongst the kangaroos and the birds and I only live a few kilometres from the mine."" 2. Newman, WA The Christmas Creek iron ore mine, operated by the Fortescue Metals Group, is the top polluting facility in Newman, Western Australia, the foundation's analysis found. It is responsible for about 23 per cent of the postcode’s emissions, according to the foundation. Fine and coarse particle pollution from the Christmas Creek mine has been steadily increasing over the last four reporting periods, the analysis found. 3. Muswellbrook, NSW Muswellbrook is a hub for Hunter Valley coal mining, known for long coal trains rumbling through the centre of town. It is the base for AGL’s Bayswater coal-fired power station, which emitted 33.2 million kg of NOx, 46.2 million kg of SO2 and 108.4 kg of mercury in the last reporting period, the foundation's analysis found. 4. Tom Price, WA An iron ore mining centre with a population of about 3,000, the town is home to 16 facilities reporting pollutants of concern, the foundation said. The analysis found that coarse particle pollution was the biggest problem which the foundation said could be mitigated by appropriate and progressive rehabilitation of mined land. 5. Traralgon, Vic Traralgon, in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, is central to AGL’s Loy Yang coal-fired power station – the second biggest polluting facility in Australia for SO2 and third highest for NOx. Exposure to NOx can irritate eyes and lead to coughing, shortness of breath, tiredness and nausea, the foundation said. High exposure can cause a build-up of fluid in the lungs and even death. 6. Gladstone, Qld A major industrial centre on the central Queensland coast, Gladstone is home to a coal-fired power station in the suburbs of town, the foundation said. The analysis found fine particle pollution (PM2.5), which was drawn down deep into the lungs and could cause asthma, stroke and heart attacks, had increased every year over past four reporting periods. 7. Stanwell, Qld The small town of Stanwell is host to a power station that accounts for 74 per cent of the postcode’s emissions, the foundation's analysis showed. A comparison with another coal-fired power station, the Bayswater power station in Muswellbrook, found Stanwell had a much higher NOx emission intensity for the power it produced. 8. Collie, WA The Muja Power Station at Collie, WA, is responsible for 34 per cent of the postcode’s emissions, the foundation found. 9. Tarong, Qld Home to the Tarong coal-fired power station and Meandu Mine, the power station is responsible for 80 per cent of the postcode’s emissions, the foundation found. 10. Kalgoorlie, WA Known for silver, mercury, lead and gold mines, there were were 18 facilities in the Kalgoorlie postcode reporting pollutants of concern. Queensland Environment Minister Meaghan Scanlon said the state needed a federal government that supported renewable energy, more jobs in more industries and climate action. ""Right now, the department reports and monitors close to 40 monitoring stations throughout Queensland, including in Mount Isa and in Gladstone, where we have installed eight monitoring stations,"" she said. ""Overall, air quality has improved over the last three decades and remains relatively good as a result of industry regulation, stricter emission standards for motor vehicles and new emission reduction technology.""

76,"ASX rises despite economic worries, Wall Street struggles on recession risk",business,"  ASX rises despite economic worries, Wall Street struggles on recession risk Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Mining and energy companies propped up the Australian share market on Tuesday, though worries about a global economic slowdown and aggressive interest rate hikes kept sentiment in check. The ASX 200 index closed 0.3 per cent higher at 7,112 points. By 4:20pm AEST, the Australian dollar was trading at 70 US cents, after a 0.5 per cent rise. The local currency fell as low as 68.73 US cents this week, its weakest level in two years. Overnight, global market sentiment was affected by China's worse-than-expected economic figures, which showed that widening COVID-19 lockdowns took a heavy toll on consumption, industrial production and employment in April, adding to fears of a global slowdown. ""Chinese economic activity may recover in May because daily new infections have trended down recently and the number of medium‑ to high‑risk areas have fallen,"" said Commonwealth Bank's head of international economics Joseph Capurso. ""But we are cautious about definitively calling a bottom in the Australian dollar because [its] near term direction relies on Chinese COVID policy."" Shares in Brambles dropped 7.6 per cent, after revealing that it is no longer a buyout target. In a statement, it said European private equity firm CVC Capital Partners has pulled out of preliminary talks with Brambles, over a potential $20 billion takeover bid, citing ""current external market volatility"". Debate is raging about what is a fair wage increase that will not send businesses broke and consumer prices soaring. It comes a day after Brambles announced to the market that it was engaging in these discussions with CVC. Meanwhile, James Hardie Industries' share price tumbled 3.5 per cent. It was after the company reported its annual profit jumped over a third buoyed by strong demand for its fibre cement products in the North American market, but still came in at the lower end of its forecast range. Its adjusted net income was $US620.7 million for the year ended March 31, compared with its forecast range of $US620 million to $US630 million, which was hiked four times during fiscal 2022. Demand for new homes in the United States, which accounts for James Hardie's majority of revenue, grew last year as people flocked towards spacious, low-density accommodations helped by low lending rates and favourable market conditions. However, with the US central bank raising interest rates to tackle growing inflation, the borrowing cost is also set to rise, resulting in a possible slowdown in the housing market. Some of today's best performers include Lynas Rare Earths (+6.6pc), lithium producers Allkem (+5.5pc) and Pilbara Minerals (+5pc), along with Whitehaven Coal (+5.9pc) and Beach Energy (+6.1pc). On the flip side, Pointsbet (-4.6pc), Magellan Financial (-4.1pc), Codan (-3.9pc), Goodman Group (-4.1pc) and REA Group (-4.1pc) experienced heavy losses. The Reserve Bank has confirmed that it was considering a sharper rise in interest rates at its May meeting. But it settled on a ""normal"" 25 basis point rise (0.25 percentage points) because it would meet again in a month, a strong hint it will hike again in June. Minutes of this month's meeting showed the RBA board also considered hiking by 40 basis points. However, it decided to move by 25 basis points to 0.35 per cent, since this would mark a return to ""normal operating procedures"". ""Given that the Board meets monthly, it would have the opportunity to review the setting of interest rates again within a relatively short period of time, based on additional information,"" the minutes showed. ""They also agreed that further increases in interest rates would likely be required to ensure that inflation in Australia returns to the target over time."" The market took that as a clear sign it would hike again at its June 7 meeting, and probably by 25 basis points. Futures markets are now betting the cash rate target will lift to 0.60 per cent in June, and already have rates reaching 2.75 per cent by year end. If correct, that would be one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in recent history and a serious burden to households who hold a record $2 trillion in mortgage debt. The RBA's sudden shift on policy followed data showing inflation surged to 20-year peaks in the first quarter as energy, building, health and food costs all ballooned. Core inflation shot to 3.7 per cent, the highest since 2009 and uncomfortably far above the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent target band. Indeed, the central bank now expects core inflation to stay above the band until 2024, underlining the scale of the policy task ahead. ""Members observed that it would be more difficult to return inflation to the target if the inflation psychology in Australia were to shift in an enduring way,"" the minutes showed. In deciding whether the June rate increase will be a normal (25 basis point) or larger move (40 basis points), the RBA will be closely watching this week's March-quarter wage figures (published on Wednesday) and April employment numbers (on Thursday). Commonwealth Bank economist Belinda Allen said the RBA will probably opt for the larger rate hike if wages growth is ""stronger than expected"" (a quarterly jump of 0.9 per cent or above), or if the jobless rate is below 3.8 per cent. ""When you see big 'up' days, I'm not surprised to see some profit-taking on the subsequent day,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder, who was referring to last Friday's rebound on Wall Street. Shanghai authorities may be loosening the city's COVID lockdown, but after weeks of uncertainty, foreign workers are considering leaving. ""We're simply seeing a reaction to recent strength. There are various factors driving the market, but in general, none of them are very positive."" The S&P 500 lost 0.4 per cent, to end at 4,009 points on Monday (local time). Overall, the benchmark index has posted a six-week losing streak, its longest since 2011. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.2 per cent, to 11,664. The tech-driven index is in a bear market, having dropped by about 30 per cent since its November record high. The Dow Jones index rose by 0.1 per cent, to finish at 32,236. But it has slumped for seven weeks in a row, its longest losing streak since 2001. Shares in US mega-cap growth stocks fell, weighing heavily on the S&P and Nasdaq. They include Amazon and Google-owner Alphabet, which dropped 2 and 1.4 per cent respectively. Twitter shares plunged by a further 8 per cent, after Elon Musk said a deal to buy the social media company at a lower price than his previously agreed $US44 billion was ""not out of the question"", according to a Bloomberg report. Tesla, which Musk leads, fell by 5.9 per cent. Investors have been worried that aggressive interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve to combat decades-high inflation could tip the economy into a recession. The desire to make housing more affordable also needs to address the worrying flip side: falling house prices for many Australians. The war in Ukraine, supply chain disruptions and the pandemic-related lockdowns in China were also exacerbating the economic troubles. Traders are now pricing a near 86 per cent chance of a 50-basis-point hike (0.5 percentage points) by the Fed in June. A key concern is that, by allowing US inflation climb to its highest level in around 40 years, the Fed may need to hike interest rates more aggressively, to the extent it may trigger an economic downturn. But markets may be pricing in ""too much recession risk"", according to one of JP Morgan's lead strategists Marko Kolanovic, who has maintained a ""pro-risk"" mindset. In a note to clients, he wrote that US and European stock markets are betting on a 70 per cent chance of a ""near-term recession"". He said this was higher than the estimates from investment-grade debt markets (50 per cent), high-yield debt markets (30 per cent) and rate markets (10 to 20 per cent). ""Equities stand to recover if a recession doesn’t come through, given already substantial multiple de-rating, reduced positioning and downbeat sentiment,"" he added. Gold lifted by 0.7 per cent, to $US1,824 an ounce. Oil prices rose as the European Union stepped closer to an import ban on Russian crude and traders viewed signs that the COVID-19 pandemic was receding in the hardest-hit areas of China, suggesting a significant demand recovery was in the works. Brent crude futures jumped 2.4 per cent, to $US114 a barrel.

77,Caroline lived in her car for months in what is often regarded as Australia's most affluent city,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog According to the ACT Council of Social Service's latest report, nearly one in 10 Canberrans are living below the poverty line, challenging the perception of a ""well-off"" and ""rich"" national capital. Canberrans have faced steeper price rises for electricity, child care and rent than other Australians Caroline, who moved back to Canberra last year to be closer to her daughter, is one example. Since moving to the ACT, Caroline has struggled to find a job and to consistently have a roof over her head. ""Even though I have a degree and I have worked in administration and business for a long time, it is still very difficult for me,"" she said. She has since found emergency accommodation, but before that she was forced to live in her car for months. ""I found it quite difficult because Canberra is very cold and I got a lung infection just before I found this house,"" she said. ""There is such little housing available … a one-bedroom house is about $350 per week. ""That's almost the whole weekly allowance of JobSeeker."" Caroline is one of many Canberrans who has turned to St John's Care – a charity that provides free essentials to those struggling to make ends meet – for assistance. Operations manager Robbie Speldewinde said he had seen a huge rise in demand. ""There are a couple of factors contributing to that,"" he said. ""The increased cost of food is a big one … but also the increased cost of petrol. Going to fill up your car at the moment has put a lot of people out of pocket."" Mr Speldewinde said the charity was also seeing ""a whole new clientele"". ""People with car loans and mortgages who have never accessed the service before are coming here for basic support,"" he said. ""It is hard to see."" There are four key factors affecting most household budgets: petrol, food, housing, and electricity. In Canberra, this is what happened to prices in just one year for these common goods and services: Financial consultant Deb Shroot works for Care, an organisation that provides free financial advice. She said a lot of the consultants had been constantly booked out recently. ""People are presenting with quite extreme levels of financial hardship,"" she said. ""A lot of people are calling because they cannot afford essentials such as petrol, food items and insurance."" Ms Shroot said a lot of her conversations lately had been heart-breaking. ""A lot of people are calling and they do not even have next week's rent payment – they do not have enough food for their family for this week,"" she said. Ms Shroot said more Canberrans were turning to buy now, pay later services as a way of saving money in the short term, but she said it only added to their debt in the longer term. ""Electricity companies have very good interest-free hardship programs and we recommend people call their providers and speak to them in the first instance,"" she said. She also recommended people call free services like Care for advice. The cost of living had been falling for most Australians for more than a decade. But those good times are over, and it has been a tough year across the country. However, if it feels like Canberra is more expensive than elsewhere in some ways, it's because it is. While the cost of electricity, child care and rent increased for many Australians, the price rises in Canberra far exceeded national average increases. And while the cost of international travel fell elsewhere in Australia, it increased in Canberra by 2.4 per cent. Some households have been hit harder than others. Age and veterans pensioners are suffering the most — the Australian Bureau of Statistics suggests that the goods and services that pensioners typically buy have been going up in price faster than the things that other households buy. The price of property – whether to buy or rent – has also skyrocketed in Canberra during the COVID-19 pandemic. Peta Stamell managed to buy her own place, but says she chose to live in share houses for about 15 years so she could afford it. ""I wanted to have a child and I also have a disability, which requires me to have minor house modifications, and renting you cannot get anything done,"" she said. ""Now that I am in my 30s I thought it would be nice to not have to climb on things to get into my own house."" But while Ms Stamell says she feels grateful she got into the housing market before prices rose even further, she says she still had to make compromises. She and her sister pooled their money to buy a two-bedroom home, where they both live along with Ms Stamell's five-month-old son. She knows she will have to upgrade eventually. ""Although the house we bought has increased in value it does not really mean anything unless you have got spare properties on hand and I do not,"" she said. ""So I will be upgrading to a substantially more expensive property and I am not looking forward to doing that."" Ms Stamell believes that affordable housing is a basic human right and wants reform that helps lower prices. ""The problem with the Australian housing market is that its success is determined by how much equity it makes investors, not by how well it houses people, which is ridiculous,"" she said.

78,What are the two major parties promising for first home buyers?,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Cracking into the property market has never been easy for most, but recently it seems harder than ever. Home ownership rates among younger Australians — people under 40 — have been steadily declining for decades. Housing affordability, and particularly how to help people buy their own home, has emerged as one of the key policy contests of the federal election. Labor wants to use the government's cash to help first home buyers into the market, while the Coalition thinks unlocking superannuation could be the key. So what precisely are the two major parties offering? Lets start with the new super scheme. With less than a week left in the campaign, the Coalition unveiled its biggest pitch on housing policy in years. If re-elected, it is promising to allow first home buyers to dip into their superannuation to help supplement a house deposit. There are limits: you must already have a five per cent deposit before you can apply; and you can only access 40 per cent of your super, to a maximum $50,000. If you later sell the property, you must return the money taken from super along with a proportion of capital gains. With the federal election underway it can be hard to keep up with where each party stands on some of the key issues. We've made a little cheat sheet to make it easier. It's a significant shift in how the Coalition wants voters to think about superannuation — from a locked vault to be accessed in retirement, to a pool of cash that can be used solve today's problems. The Coalition argues voters should be able to spend their own money, and say putting it in housing is generally a good investment, so nothing is lost. Labor says it will reduce superannuation balances and artificially inflate house prices — compounding the difficulties facing first home buyers. While this policy is the most contentious, there are others Labor has agreed to match. That includes allowing people aged over 55 to deposit up to $300,000 in super from the sale of their home if they downsize (avoiding potential asset test problems), and letting pensioners keep their full pension for two years after they sell their home. Both policies are aimed at freeing up larger homes for younger buyers. The Coalition also plans to expand its popular home guarantee schemes — letting first home buyers purchase a home with a five per cent deposit, or two per cent for single parents. It includes a scheme dedicated for regional buyers, which looks very similar to a policy first outlined by Anthony Albanese in his budget reply speech. Scott Morrison is also promising to help build thousands of new social housing and affordable homes, by pumping $2 billion into low-cost loans offered by the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. Housing is also one of Labor's key pitches this election. The party used its campaign launch in Perth three weeks ago to unveil its ""Help to Buy"" scheme. And the name is pretty apt. The government would help you buy a house by purchasing up to 40 per cent of it with you. The scheme is capped at 10 thousand places a year, and is limited to individuals earning less than $90,000 or couples earning $120,000. The government would subsequently own a share in your house, which you can choose to buy back over time. Making housing more affordable by making it cheaper seems to be electoral death. But there may be other ways to help first-time buyers into the market, writes Michael Janda. If your income increases above the thresholds, you will have to start buying it back. And if you sell the house, the government will take back its share, along with the relevant proportion of any capital gains (making it a potential revenue earner). Similar ""shared equity"" schemes are already running in some states, like the Keystart program in WA and the Homebuyer Fund in Victoria. Labor says it will make buying a house more realistic for many people by shaving 30 or 40 per cent off the purchase price. The Coalition argues people should be buying their own homes with their own money, not having the government sitting around the dinner table. Labor's other key housing policy is setting up the Housing Australia Future Fund. Basically, it will operate as a $10 billion investment fund that will use the returns it makes to build social and affordable housing across the country. Labor says it will make enough money to build 30,000 homes in five years. Also, as mentioned above, it backs the government's expansion of the various deposit-guarantee schemes. But there is a small difference between what the two parties are offering the regions. Labor's scheme would offer 10,000 five per cent deposit guarantee spots to any first home buyer looking for a home in a regional area, as long as they had lived there for 12 months. The Coalition's scheme is limited to new homes, but is open to anyone (not just first home buyers). The various policies have attracted support and criticism from a range of areas. Some have criticised the policies overall for lacking ambition, arguing while they may help some aspiring buyers, they will not broadly tackle the problem of housing affordability. Both the Coalition and Labor's centrepiece policies help to encourage demand for housing, rather than significantly increasing the supply of homes. Both sides argue they have policies aimed at increasing supply, but industry groups argue much more could be done. And those who watch housing policy closely note neither major party is offering anything that would decrease house prices — and given there are more home owners than aspiring homebuyers, that is unlikely to change.

79,Experts warn that first home buyers may be hit when trying to upgrade if they use super for their deposit,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Many leading economists say allowing first home buyers to draw their superannuation will eventually push house prices higher. But are Australians better off leaving their money in their super fund or using it for a home deposit? No-one can predict if in a decade from now house prices will have risen faster than superannuation savings. Economists also argue policymakers need to consider the implications of measures that drain people's savings for retirement (and in turn could lead to more people in future relying on the age pension) and that fuel demand for housing. It now takes more than a decade for a first home buyer to save a deposit for a first home. And by the time they do, they are almost into their 40s (ABS data shows the average age of a first home buyer is now 36). The latest ABS data shows the average super balance for 35-44-year-olds was $62,400 (all genders). A breakdown in gender shows it is typically higher (at $80,000) for males and lower (at $53,000) for females. But for 25-to-34-year-olds, the average super balance is far lower, at $25,000. (At this early stage the balance between genders is similar — $25,500 average for males, and $22,000 for females). So most young people do not have a huge amount saved for retirement, and taking out $50,000 would, for many of them, entirely deplete their super funds. But let's assume that a first home buyer does have $50,000 to withdraw. And let's assume there's a re-elected Coalition government, and on July 2023 they allow first home buyers to access up to 40 per cent of their superannuation, to a maximum of $50,000. The desire to make housing more affordable also needs to address the worrying flip side: falling house prices for many Australians. Would a first home buyer, then, be better off leaving their money in their super fund and allowing it to compound over time? Or would they be better off pulling it out and putting towards their first home, and then selling it at some stage later? The Australia Institute modelling for ABC News shows they are likely better off leaving their money in superannuation. The average annual rate of house price increases (weighted capital city) over the past 10 years is 8.4 per cent, while the return for those who invested via Australia's largest super fund, Australian Super (average balanced fund), was 9.7 per cent per year. But that modelling comes with some big disclaimers. The first disclaimer, according to The Australia Institute's senior economist Matt Grudnoff, is that comparing something that has a use value (the house you bought) with an investment (super) is tricky. Nevertheless, Mr Grudnoff did the modelling using ABS house price data and using the Australian Super average balanced fund. It shows that if somebody ten years ago had left $50,000 in their superannuation, today it would be worth $126,539. But if ten years ago, they had pumped that $50,000 into housing, it would be worth $91,579 (based on the weighted average for the eight capital cities). The situation gets more complicated if you take account of the fact that super earnings get taxed at 15 per cent, while the family home is tax exempt (when you sell there's no capital gains on it). The Australia Institute modelling shows that even in that scenario, if somebody ten years ago left the $50,000 in super, they would now have $112,346. Mr Grudnoff says there's another disclaimer here. Firstly, as you often hear at the end of super fund TV advertisements: ""past superannuation fund performance does not reflect future superannuation fund performance"". Secondly,  not all super funds performed as well as the Australian Super average balanced fund. Finally, there's the possibility, that house prices keep rising, and that ten years from now, the price of homes is worth far more. But Mr Grudnoff says that house prices going up doesn't help an owner occupier, ""because if they ever sell, they have to buy back into the market"". ""So, they might sell for more than they bought for, but they then have to buy back into the market at the higher price,"" Mr Grudnoff says. Mr Grudnoff also notes that $50,000 will not buy all of a house so it depends on how much the $50,000 saved you in future house costs. ""That might even be zero if giving everyone access to super simply pushed up house prices by $50,000,"" he adds. The flipside of opting to keep money in your super fund, he says, is that you still need a place to live and then must factor in rent. ""But ignoring all these difficulties, investing your money in super would have given you a better return over the past 10 years."" Our federal politicians have recognised there is an appetite among Australians (especially young people keen to get into the property market) to dip into their super to pay for immediate costs like housing. During pandemic lockdowns, Australians flocked to take up the federal governments emergency support measures, which included allowing them to draw out $20,000 of their superannuation. Between April 20, 2020 and December 31, 2020, the federal government received 4.78 million applications from Australians to access their super, of which 4.55 million were approved for 3.05 million people, totalling $37.8 billion of super. That has slightly depleted super balances now, and the super fund industry argues because they lose out on that money growing over time, many will be worse off. A recent parliamentary inquiry headed by Liberal MP Jason Falinski looked at the idea of using super for housing. It suggested that ""allowing first home buyers to access or borrow against part of their super to purchase a home would, in the absence of increased housing supply, likely increase demand and lead to higher property prices"". Ray White chief economist Nerida Conisbee argues that both Liberal housing policy and Labor's shared equity scheme (which would see a Labor government buy 30 or 40 per cent of a property with the buyer) could lead to prices rising faster than they otherwise would. She says using ""superannuation for buying owner-occupier housing is not recommended"". ""The family home is not an asset that can be easily cashed in at retirement,"" she says. The review says wealthy savers should instead tap into the equity of their homes to help fund their retirement. ""Using superannuation from early on in a person's life cycle for a home can also lead to far less at retirement, particularly if the family home can't be easily sold to downsize or does not increase in value as hoped."" She argues that first homes are rarely forever homes and most first home buyers use the equity built up in their first homes to get a home more suitable for the next stage of their lives. ""Having to hand back a big chunk of equity to the government at this stage, or back into superannuation, will make it difficult for first home buyers to get into their next homes,"" she says. Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) chief executive Martin Fahy says while they have not done modelling to compare house price growth with superannuation fund investment growth, returns have been averaging about 7 per cent in super. He notes that the federal government's retirement income review conducted by former Treasury official Mike Callaghan did not recommend using superannuation for housing. Mr Fahey does not support draining peoples retirement savings, saying over time they could be worse off. 'What we're doing is we're removing a large portion of their existing savings from their superannuation — they're losing the compounding effect [of super savings earning interest and building up over time]."" ""And the reality is for many low and medium income earners who are in their 30s, they don't have a large superannuation balance,"" he adds. Independent economist Saul Eslake is not a fan of either the Coalition's housing policy or Labor's shared equity scheme, saying both add to housing demand which in turn pushes up house prices. But as to whether a person would be better or worse off leaving their money in super rather than pulling it out to put towards a home deposit, he says, ""ultimately it comes down to question of which you think will go up faster for the period you own that house"". He adds that a policy that encourages people to have a bigger mortgage also comes with greater risk. ""If you are going to compare returns, you also need to account for the different risks — you may get a great return, but you are also taking on a greater risk [with housing than super],"" he says. As interest rates rise, almost 300,000 people who took large and risky home loans during the pandemic could fall into severe financial hardship or even default. Mr Eslake argues that the real solution to making housing more affordable is to tackle tax breaks such as negative gearing and the capital gains tax concession that primarily benefit wealthy investors. ""Politicians routinely shed crocodile tears for the difficulties faced by first buyers in getting a foot on the property market ladder, but they know any given year there's only 100,000 people that succeed in that. ""Whereas, at any point in time there's 11 million Australians that own one property and 2 million or more that own two or more properties. ""Politicians don't want to slow the rate of property prices."" And while Liberal and Labor housing policies could push house prices up rather than help make it more affordable, economists worry there's also the issue of generational inequities that are being exacerbated by proposed changes to superannuation policy. They say the Coalition's planned changes to super rules that give pensioners, self-funded retirees and working older Australians financial incentives to sell their family home earlier and downsize, may worsen the divide between housing haves (typically older people) and housing have nots (typically younger people). While house prices are expected to fall nationally as interest rates continue to rise, that won't necessarily improve affordability. The Coalition's super policy — first introduced in the 2017-18 budget — is to tweak an existing tax break allowing up to $300,000 from the sale of a family home to be placed into superannuation without a penalty. Under the current rules, anyone aged over 65 can sell their home of 10 years or more and place $300,000 of the proceeds into their superannuation. The age limit was already due to be lowered to 60 from July 1, but the Coalition has promised to instead lower it to 55 if re-elected. CoreLogic's head of Australian research Eliza Owen says while up to 1.3 million households are eligible for the scheme, only 22,000 people utilised the first iteration of the scheme between July 2018 and May 2021. She also adds that historically, first home buyer activity has been elevated when first homebuyer schemes are enacted. ""Temporary, demand-side first homebuyer incentives coincide with a surge in demand,"" she says. CoreLogic data shows the current median dwelling value in Australia is $748,635, meaning the scheme could help increase the size of a standard deposit by about 1 per cent. ""Australia does not just have a housing affordability problem, but a housing equality problem,"" Ms Owen says. She notes that Grattan Institute research shows that poorer Australians have seen the biggest declines in rates of home ownership, which then is the difference between a comfortable retirement, and a retirement of poverty. ""For home ownership to play such a significant role in our financial futures, it should be more equally accessible,"" Ms Owen says. ""Unlike the first home loan deposit scheme, or Labor's proposed shared equity scheme, there are no income caps associated with the Super Home Buyer Scheme, making it far more advantageous for young first homebuyers on higher incomes."" The other major change to super announced by the Liberals that aims to encourage pensioners to sell is to exempt the proceeds of the sale from the assets test for two years instead of one. Currently, pensioners are given a year's grace period after selling to buy a new home or arrange their assets, during which the cash made from the sale is exempt from the assets test. The Coalition's new policy would double that period to two years from January 1, 2023. Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) chief executive Cassandra Goldie does not support that extension. She says if the government really wants to support older people, they should double the value of Commonwealth Rent Assistance for those who are really struggling. ""One year is long enough for people to reorganise their finances after selling their home and in most cases, they have purchased new accommodation by then in any event,"" Dr Goldie argues. ""Extending this concession [for the sale to be exempt from the assets test] would be inequitable since many people on the Age Pension have few or no assets to fall back on.""

80,McDonalds to close all stores in Russia and remove its symbolism from the country,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog McDonald's has started the process of selling its Russian business, which includes 850 restaurants that employ 62,000 people, making it the latest major Western corporation to exit Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February. The fast food giant pointed to the humanitarian crisis caused by the war, saying holding on to its business in Russia ""is no longer tenable, nor is it consistent with McDonald's values"". The Chicago-based company announced in early March that it was temporarily closing its stores in Russia but would continue to pay employees. On Monday, it said it would seek to have a Russian buyer hire those workers and pay them until the sale closes. It did not identify a prospective buyer. CEO Chris Kempczinski said the ""dedication and loyalty to McDonald's"" of employees and hundreds of Russian suppliers made it a difficult decision to leave. ""However, we have a commitment to our global community and must remain steadfast in our values,"" Mr Kempczinski said in a statement, ""and our commitment to our values means that we can no longer keep the arches shining there"". As it tries to sell its restaurants, McDonald's said it plans to start removing golden arches and other symbols and signs with the company's name. It said it will keep its trademarks in Russia. The first McDonald's in Russia opened in the middle of Moscow more than three decades ago, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was a powerful symbol of the easing of Cold War tensions between the United States and Soviet Union. McDonald's first opened its doors in Moscow just after the Berlin Wall came down, but now it's closing those same doors as Russia continues its offensive in Ukraine. McDonald's said it expects to record a charge against earnings of between $US1.2 billion ($1.7 billion) and $US1.4 ($2.0 billion) billion over leaving Russia. Its restaurants in Ukraine are closed, but the company said it is continuing to pay full salaries for its employees there. McDonald's said exiting Russia will not change its forecast of adding a net 1,300 restaurants this year, which will contribute about 1.5 per cent to company wide sales growth. Last month, McDonald's reported that it earned $US1.1 billion ($1.6 billion) in the first quarter, down from more than $1.5 billion ($2.2 billion) a year earlier. Revenue was nearly $US5.7 billion ($8.2 billion).

81,"Morrison 'not contemplating' quitting if he loses election, claims he can defy polls again",business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Prime Minister Scott Morrison claims he can defy national opinion polls and win Saturday's federal election, saying Australians want him to be a ""more inclusive"" Prime Minister if he gets another term in power. Despite the upbeat message, some of his Liberal colleagues are increasingly worried the national polls are suggesting a Labor landslide is the most likely outcome this weekend. The opposition believes it is competitive or in front in a swathe of seats. It needs to win just seven to claim a majority, while the government cannot afford to lose any. But in a wide-ranging interview with 7.30 about his prospects and time in office, the Prime Minister declared he was not thinking about standing down after Saturday's poll, even in the event of a defeat or a hung parliament. ""No, that is not something I'm contemplating because I'm not contemplating that being the scenario,"" Mr Morrison said. Josh Frydenberg, or possibly Peter Dutton, are considered the most likely to be the next Liberal leaders should the Coalition lose, though that would be dependent on both men retaining their seats and the final numbers in the party room. Some independent candidates, like Zali Steggall, have already indicated they would be unlikely to support the Coalition in the event of a hung parliament if Mr Morrison remained leader. The Prime Minister said he would accept the outcome of the election because he trusted the choices Australians made at the ballot box, but he would not ""speculate"" on what could happen on Saturday. ""I'm focused on one thing and that's ensuring our government continues,"" he added. ""The only person who has announced their retirement is you, Leigh, and I wish you very well in your retirement."" In another concession that his personal popularity was a drag on the government's vote in some key seats, the Prime Minister again suggested he would change if given a second chance. ""People really just want to see me be more inclusive in terms of how I go forward,"" he said, rejecting claims voters were angry with him because he had not taken responsibility for some of the government's failures. ""They're Labor's criticisms,"" he added. But he did suggest he may have alienated some voters by ""acting decisively"" during the pandemic. ""During the course of a crisis and a pandemic, you've got to move fast, you've got to be decisive and that means sometimes you can't take everybody with you and you don't always get everything right either,"" Mr Morrison said. ""But in the next phase, then we've got the opportunity to bring people forward on that plan. ""I'll tell you one thing, the only way Australians are going to be able to get access to their superannuation to buy their own home is if they vote Liberal and National, because the Labor Party will never do it."" Liberals concede the Prime Minister and his Deputy, the Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, are unpopular in some inner-city seats in Sydney and Melbourne that are being targeted by independents backed by the Climate 200 group. As a result, Mr Morrison's campaign has mostly targeted seats in suburban and regional areas in a bid to take electorates off Labor. ""Many of these places, [inner-city seats] I suppose, are less vulnerable to the impacts of the economy than, say, many of the places I've been in this campaign,"" he said, when asked why some traditionally Liberal heartland seats were under threat. ""But I do know this, you can't address climate change and invest in the technology you need to deal with climate change unless you have a strong economy."" Senior members of the Labor opposition remain deeply scarred after losing the 2019 election and some refuse to believe the situation is as rosy as the polls make out. That said, a number believe the party has successfully stuck to its strategy over the past three years. ""I know people will pick over this next week when it's all done and dusted, but from my point of view, it's gone to plan,"" Shadow Finance Minister Katy Gallagher said. ""It was about looking at Anthony's leadership, it was about looking at what happened in 2019, what went wrong, laying down the things you want to campaign on, putting the policy work together, and in this fourth quarter … kicking with the wind."" However, in a sign of how nervous the Labor Party remains about this campaign, she immediately added: ""Touch wood.""

82,Gas guzzlers be gone! New Zealand will subsidise low-income earners to drive 'clean' cars,business,"  New Zealand's emissions reduction plan to get low-income earners into hybrid and electric cars Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog New Zealand's government will help pay for lower-income families to scrap their old gas guzzlers and replace them with cleaner hybrid or electric cars as part of a sweeping plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The government says it plans to spend $NZ569 million ($516 million) on the trial program as part of a larger plan that includes subsidies for businesses to reduce emissions, a switch to an entirely green bus fleet by 2035 and curb-side food-waste collection for most homes by the end of the decade. ""This is a landmark day in our transition to a low emissions future,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement. ""We've all seen the recent reports on sea level rise and its impact right here in New Zealand. ""We cannot leave the issue of climate change until it's too late to fix."" The plan represents a step toward the pledges the nation made under the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change and New Zealand's stated goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Ms Ardern, who was scheduled to launch the plan but cancelled after testing positive for COVID-19 late last week, said every community and sector had a role to play and that reducing reliance on fossil fuels would help shield households from volatile price hikes. The plan also sets a target of reducing total car travel by 20 per cent over the next 13 years by offering better transportation options in cities as well as improved options for cyclists and walkers. The programs will be paid for from a $NZ4.5 billion climate emergency response fund. Officials said that over time, money collected from polluters would pay for the programs rather than taxes from households. But the plan remained short on some details, including for the gas guzzler replacement plan, which the government said would be finalised over the coming months. And some critics said it continued to give an easy ride to the nation's huge agriculture industry, which creates about half of the nation's total greenhouse gas emissions but is also vital to the economy as the nation's biggest export earner. ""Some of the policies announced, like the cash-for-clunkers system, are proven to be dogs and have been tried and failed overseas,"" said David Seymour, leader of the libertarian ACT Party. Mr Seymour said consumers should be able to choose how they reduce emissions through the market-based emissions trading scheme.

83,Global consulting firm EY partners with Federation University to set up office in Ballarat,business,"  Global consulting giant EY establishes first office in regional centre creating 200 jobs in Ballarat Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As more workers leave large cities for the regions, global consulting giant Ernst & Young has opted to establish its first regional centre in Ballarat, Victoria. The move has been welcomed by the city's advocacy group, Committee for Ballarat, but its CEO Michael Poulton has also stressed a need for services and housing to keep up with this kind of rapid growth. ""It's a wonderful announcement that we've heard from EY. It really puts confidence into our regional economy and demonstrates that the region has got a lot to offer,"" Mr Poulton said. He said the new office would do a lot for the regional town's overall prospects. ""It just enhances the region's reputation as a place to do business, to live, and to come and visit and/or to invest in,"" he said. Partner and project lead for EY Daniel Wong said the company was very excited about taking advantage of the trend to move away from metro centres. ""We studied this in the feasibility, and we found that a lot of professional-services-type people are looking to relocate out of capital cities into more regional towns and cities,"" he said. The consulting firm, in its first office outside a major capital city, will create 200 jobs for regional workers in Ballarat and surrounding areas. ""Given what we've seen develop over the past couple of years with more people working and mixing remote work with on-site work, we think there's just a great opportunity in regional Australia to do that,"" he said. But this fast-changing growth could put further pressures on housing and rental affordability in regional towns like Ballarat. In 2020, 43,000 Australians moved to regional areas from capital cities according to the Australia Bureau of Statistics. This is more than double what was recorded the year before. Monash University's Bradley Woolley found in a 2021 report — Housing Affordability in the Ballarat Region — that the recent ""exodus"" from metropolitan areas to Ballarat had exacerbated housing affordability and availability. Mr Poulton said, while these challenges were not unique to Ballarat and the regions, it was ""crucial"" that Australia planned for the future. ""Because you've got companies like EY looking to come to regional areas, it's even more important that we press the accelerator on both infill and greenfield development to continue to develop a whole range of diverse housing stocks in this region,"" he said. The company will service clients across Australia and the Pacific and will partner with Federation University to recruit and train new staff. EY is already one of the world's largest professional services firms, boasting more than 300,000 employees in 150 countries. In Oceania alone, it made $2.3 million last financial year and the expansion into the Ballarat region is expected to add to that growth. ""I think it is so important that it opens up a job market of highly skilled, arguably highly paid people who can come to the town,"" Mr Poulton said. ""We'll see over time, but certainly we're committed to Ballarat and this sort of regional centre in Victoria and to make it successful,"" Mr Wong said.

84,"Actor Craig McLachlan admits pretending to fellate a banana as a 'joke' on set, court hears",business,"  Craig McLachlan sent video of himself 'pretending to masturbate' to actor Christie Whelan Browne Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Actor Craig McLachlan has admitted he sent a video of himself ""pretending to masturbate"" while ""fully clothed"" to an actress he is suing for defamation. McLachlan is suing the ABC, Nine Newspapers and actress Christie Whelan Browne over 2018 reports alleging he indecently assaulted, harassed, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan denies all claims of sexual harassment and bullying in the stories and says they ruined his reputation and put an end to his acting career. Under cross-examination in court Monday, the media's barrister, Michael Hodge QC, questioned McLachlan about a series of videos he sent to co-star Whelan Browne. Mr Hodge asked McLachlan if he texted a video of him ""purporting or pretending to masturbate"", to which McLachlan responded, ""fully clothed and not in a toilet, yes."" McLachlan was also accused of behaving crassly on set — something he strongly rejected, saying ""I don't use the word crassness in theatre"". The 56-year-old was subsequently questioned about a 12-minute blooper reel filmed in 2014 while McLachlan was a cast member on the ABC's The Doctor Blake Mysteries. Responding to questions from Mr Hodge, McLachlan admitted that in the video he is seen ""pretending to masturbate the arms of the crew"" and ""running up and kissing members of the crew"". Mr Hodge also asked: ""there's another thing you do on set; you do a performance when you have a banana, you pretend to fellate it?"" ""Yes,"" McLachlan responded. ""And then appear to deep-throat it?"" Mr Hodge questioned. ""The banana is already the appropriate shape but yes,"" McLachlan responded, adding that he didn't do it ""all the time"" but ""it's a joke I would perform."" Under questioning, McLachlan then agreed that this ""kind of sexual innuendo"" was brought by him onto the set of the 2014 Rocky Horror Show. Mr Hodge also suggested McLachlan manipulated co-star Whelan Browne into apologising for not congratulating him on being nominated for a 2014 Helpmann Award. McLachlan told the court he ""was confused"" by her lack of public congratulations because ""we were friends"". The jury heard that during this period, McLachlan emailed the show's director, Christopher Luscombe, referring to Ms Whelan Browne as a ""horror"" while also texting Whelan Browne, ""I've always supported you"". Hodge suggested this was evidence of ""manipulation"" — a suggestion McLachlan denied. McLachlan's team will have further opportunities to put forward their case as the trial continues. Later this afternoon, McLachlan's cross-examination finished and his partner, orchestral conductor Vanessa Scammell, entered the witness box. She described McLachlan as ""a wreck"" in the aftermath of the news reports and she became increasingly upset when testifying that his mental state was ""so damaged … I could barely get a constructive sentence out of him"". ""He was devastated, humiliated and betrayed,"" she told the court. ""He started to surf at night so [no one] would see him on the beach — such was his humiliation."" Ms Scammell will return to the stand tomorrow. The defamation trial is expected to run for another four weeks and will hear from 11 women who have accused McLachlan of inappropriate behaviour, claims he strongly denies.

85,"China's economy slumps from COVID-19 lockdowns, ASX rises as Brambles considers $20b takeover bid",business,"  China's economy slumps from COVID-19 lockdowns, ASX rises as Brambles considers $20b takeover bid Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian shares closed higher after a mixed day of trading, after China revealed its economy had suffered a worse-than-expected slump in April. It was the result of China's widening COVID-19 lockdowns, which are adding to fears its economy could shrink in the June quarter. Given that China is Australia's biggest trading partner, a slowdown could have a significant impact on the local economy. The ASX 200 closed up 0.2 per cent, to 7,094 points, after hitting a high of 7,149 around 11am AEST before the disappointing Chinese economic data was released. The Australian dollar slumped to its weakest level in around two years. It was buying 68.82 US cents, and had dropped 0.8 per cent. On oil markets, Brent crude futures lost 1.7 per cent and was worth $US109.78 a barrel, at 4:15pm AEST. Spot gold fell slightly to $US1,804 an ounce. China's retail sales plunged by 11.1 per cent in April — compared to a year ago — and this was its biggest slowdown since March 2020, according to figures from its National Bureau of Statistics. Shanghai authorities may be loosening the city's COVID lockdown, but after weeks of uncertainty, foreign workers are considering leaving. The reading worsened from the 3.5 per cent fall in March, and was considerably worse than economists' expectations of a 6.1 per cent drop). Dining-out services were suspended in some provinces and China's auto sales in April plunged 47.6 per cent from a year earlier as car makers slashed production amid empty showrooms and parts shortages. As the anti-virus measures snarled supply chains and paralysed distribution, industrial production fell 2.9 per cent from a year earlier. This was the the largest decline since February 2020. The shock also weighed on the job market, which Chinese leaders have prioritised for economic and social stability. China's nationwide survey-based jobless rate rose to 6.1 per cent in April — up from 5.8 per cent in March. It was the highest level of unemployment since February 2020. The nation's economy is headed for ""a sharp contraction in economic activity"", said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist from Capital Economics. ""Provided that the virus situation continues to improve, the economy should begin to rebound this month. But the recovery is likely to be tepid. ""The upshot is that, while the worst is hopefully over, we think China’s economy will struggle to return to its pre-pandemic trend."" Logistics firm Brambles was the best-performing stock on the ASX, after a 10.9 per cent jump. This was after the pallets and container supplier said it was considering an unsolicited takeover offer from European private equity firm CVC Capital Partners, which is believed to be worth $20 billion, including debt. If the deal goes through, it would be the biggest private equity takeover in the country. The other top performers were Pilbara Minerals (+5.4 per cent), Qube Holdings (+5.3 per cent), Life360 (+4.8 per cent) and Xero Limited (+4.5 per cent). On the flip side, Imugene lost 5.7 per cent, Polynovo Limited was down 4.2 per cent, followed by Zip Co Limited (-3.5 per cent), Magellan Financial (-3.2 per cent) and Tyro Payments (-3.1 per cent).

86,Warning farm wage changes may push grey nomads out of industry,business," ABC Rural Farm worker minimum wage changes may push grey nomads out of industry Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Since losing her job during the COVID-19 pandemic, Cathy Downie has been working on farms around Australia. ""I'm over 50, so I guess I'm classed as a grey nomad,"" she said. ""Although I prefer to be classed as an active nomad."" While farmers have valued any extra hands amid a labour shortage, Ms Downie is worried that changes to the horticulture award could mean her picking days are numbered. ""Picking at my own pace and on a piece rate was terrific,"" she said. ""But with this new hourly rate, it is going to make it a little bit more difficult to work. ""I'm a big advocate for nomads like myself getting out there and helping farmers for a few weeks. ""We are very productive and there's a lot of us, especially in this climate when they're crying out for workers."" The new award implemented on April 28 requires all harvest workers to be paid at least $25.41 an hour. Shoppers are being warned that cost-of-living pressures may get worse after changes to pickers' pay. Ms Downie said rising cost pressures could result in a hesitancy to hire slower workers. ""It's fair to think that you do your best when you're out there picking but you're not making enough to get that hourly rate,"" she said. ""So the farmer then has to top that up."" However, Ms Downie said some growers had missed the memo about the wage change. ""The two farmers that I have spoken to honestly didn't know anything about it,"" she said. ""It makes it hard because they're very old school, especially the ones that are in remote areas. ""They don't understand the legislation and how to pay on an hourly rate basis."" To get the message out union officials have been visiting farms across the country. Australian Workers Union (AWU) assistant secretary Daniel Walton acknowledged there had been some confusion. ""What's in place now is that workers can work on piece rates, they can still earn a premium for picking more,"" Mr Walton said. ""But at the end of week, whether they work 30 hours, 40 hours or 50 hours, they have to at the very least earn the equivalent minimum wage for every hour."" The start date for the award coincided with the citrus season in South Australia's Riverland. Citrus SA chairman Mark Doecke said it should not be the responsibility of unions to ensure people were following the rules. ""We are happy to be audited ... and while I'm sure there is some, I don't know of any underpayment in the industry,"" Mr Doecke said. ""So I'm not sure what they are trying to prove."" With growers already battling fruit fly restrictions, rising input costs and container shortages, Mr Doecke said it was frustrating to add more paperwork into the mix. ""Most of it is keeping a record of your picker's activities all day — the start time, the lunchtime, the afternoon smoko — it now has to be documented and worked back into your end of day record,"" he said. ""If the bins [picked] are less than the hours then you have to pay them the hourly rate."" Mr Doecke said with the industry about 100,000 workers short, it would be a shame to see anyone turned away. ""If a picker is slow then you just can't afford to keep them,"" he said. ""So it's actually created unemployment. It might have helped the slow picker get more money but that's not fair anyway."" Flinders University associate professor Marinella Marmo said the revised award had shown promise. ""We really don't see a big change but we are seeing the transition process, which is positive,"" she said. However, Dr Marmo said more detail was needed on how pay was calculated for grey areas like overtime and deductions. ""It needs to be regulated in a clear manner to understand whether they follow within the previous legislation, the payment by piece or the new legislation. ""So an interpretation on this particular point is needed officially by the regulator."" Dr Marmo said criminalising wage theft was the best way forward to reform the industry's reputation. ""Perhaps there is a need of a complete shift in thinking,"" she said. ""This is really about tampering with the system with little adjustments rather than sending a strong message that [underpayment] is not acceptable."" The ABC asked the Fair Work Ombudsman several questions about the details of the new award and compliance. In a statement, a spokesperson said it was ""initially focusing on educating industry participants about the change"" and suggested farmers and workers consult its horticulture showcase website for more information.

87,'The public deserves to know': Calls for federal MP to outline alternative rail route ,business,"  Alternative Gold Coast light rail options would lead to 'hundreds of resumptions', according to Transport Minister Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog State Transport Minister Mark Bailey has called on federal MP Karen Andrews to tell voters where stage 4 of Gold Coast Light Rail should be built after she said the federal government would not commit to fund the $2.7 billion Gold Coast Highway option. Last week the Liberal Party's Member for McPherson wrote in an open letter to Palm Beach residents that she had ""deep concerns"" about the project, which would result in light rail being extended south from Burleigh Heads along the Gold Coast Highway to Coolangatta. Mr Bailey said an independent consultancy group considered three other options before suggesting the Gold Coast Highway. ""It's controversial, some people don't want it down there but a lot of people do want it on the Gold Coast Highway,"" he said. ""That would be the most effective route."" The Transport and Main Roads Minister said Ms Andrews has been inconsistent about the project. ""I think the public deserves to know before the election what Karen Andrews actually supports,"" he said. ""Her position has been changing regularly; she said she was for it earlier on and now she's against it. ""Now she says she wants it to the airport, but she won't reveal what the route should be. Mr Bailey said there were three alternative route options along Cypress Terrace, Townson Avenue or Mallawa Drive in Palm Beach. He said they were ruled out by the state government because they would require up to 150 property resumptions and there was an increased flood risk. ""Karen Andrews needs to tell the public what the route should be of the Light Rail and whose houses would have to be resumed,"" Mr Bailey, said. Karen Andrews issued a statement in response to Mark Bailey's comments. ""I've been consistent in my position,"" she said. ""The people who live and work on the southern Gold Coast will be most impacted by the proposal and need to be listened to. ""Our community is concerned with increased traffic congestion with the highway going down to one lane, the impacts on our natural environment, and the impacts on our small businesses. ""I'm proud to fight for the people of the southern Gold Coast and will continue to do so."" Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate said he wanted the light rail connected to the Coolangatta airport by the 2032 Olympics. Contracts have been finalised for construction of stage 3, which runs from Broadbeach to Burleigh Heads. The 6.7km stage is due for completion in 2025.

88,Country doctor's breast cancer journey takes stressful detour as treatment hub stalls,business,"  Geraldton radiotherapy service funding stalls, leaving patients with long drive to Perth Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Midwest cancer patients and the state medical association are calling for a promised radiotherapy service to be built in Geraldton as state and federal governments stall on fully funding the project. Geraldton general practitioner Mahee Jayakody became a patient when she was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. ""I felt a breast lump — I knew,"" she said. Dr Jayakody said it was ""a very bad diagnosis"" because the cancer had spread into to her lymph nodes. She underwent chemotherapy in Geraldton but in January she had to travel to Perth for six weeks of radiotherapy, leaving her family, work and community more than 440km away. She said anxiety about the diagnosis and navigating a bigger city meant everyday activities like driving and shopping were chaotic. She said her nine-year-old child struggled with staying in Geraldton for school. ""My son was really anxious about it … he wanted to stay with me to make sure that I was coming out of the hospital,"" she said. ""[If I was in Geraldton] he would have seen me every day which would have reassured him."" She said the mental health impacts were difficult, but so were the extra financial burdens from travelling for treatment. She said she wanted to see a local radiation unit. ""[Patients] could be here and receiving therapy and probably going home …. and their quality of life could have been so good as well,"" she said. Geraldton farmers Anne and Ben Forbes also want to see radiotherapy offered in the region after travelling to Perth for Mr Forbes' cancer treatment twice in recent years. Ms Forbes said being away from home caused extra worry. ""The first stress hits you when the diagnosis come in, you go 'oh my God',"" she said. ""There's more stress when you're actually down there because you feel like you're cut off from your family, from everything you normally do."" She said a local unit would solve some of the problems regional residents faced. ""People would be able to go in, have their treatment and go home like people in the city do,"" she said. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt announced a radiation oncology service for Geraldton in 2019 when the Australian government committed $9 million to the project. It was a part of nation-wide funding for 13 radiation centres. However there remained a $10 million shortfall to fully fund the project to which the state and federal governments had not committed. State health minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said the government was putting $122 million into redeveloping the Geraldton Health Campus and while it did not include a radiotherapy service, oncology and radiation would be considered later in the redevelopment. She called on the federal government to cover the remaining cost of the unit. Durack federal MP Melissa Price said the initial $9 million was agreed with the state but the remaining $10 million was not an election promise. She said the government had contributed an estimated $14.1 billion to WA public hospital services from 2020-2025. Australian Medical Association WA president Mark Duncan-Smith said having radiotherapy was ""extremely important"" in regional areas. ""It's very disappointing to hear that this has been promised for three years and for whatever reason the funding has been held up,"" he said. ""I really think that this should be a priority for whoever is meant to be coming up with the extra money to sort this out."" Mr Duncan-Smith said while radiotherapy could be planned around travel, it would be ideal to have a unit in the Geraldton region. ""It's not the sort of thing where it has to be done on a certain day, it can be done … within a window of a week or two,"" he said. ""But that's not an excuse to not really provide the best service possible. ""A radiotherapy unit in Geraldton is going to really service the whole of the Midwest.""

89,Call for 'missiles and infrastructure' to protect $100 billion assets in northern WA,business,"  North West Defence Alliance calls for better resources to deter potential threats Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Defence installations such as missiles and large-scale bases should be built in Western Australia's north to protect the region's export industries, according to local leaders. The state's north generates hundreds of billions of dollars for the national economy, with most of the funds coming from the lucrative resources industry. North West Defence Alliance (NWDA) chair Peter Long, who is also the Mayor of Karratha, said despite the region's significance to the country, it had long lacked investment and attention from defence. ""We're really quite concerned about the exposure that we have in a world that's increasingly dangerous,"" he said. The NWDA is made up of nine local governments in the region, which currently has observational forces such as the Pilbara Regiment. There are also two unmanned RAAF bases – at Curtin in the Kimberley and Learmonth near Exmouth. It was revealed on Friday that a high-tech Chinese surveillance ship had been tracked off the WA coast, close to a secretive naval facility at Exmouth that supports American and other allied submarines. Mr Long said Australia was dealing with an uncertain strategic environment and called for a bigger military presence to deter potential threats from directing aggression at local gas and mining assets. ""We've got hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure being built up here, and it's really not being protected at all,"" he said. ""If something happens, it'll probably happen very quickly and we think we need more of a deterrent. ""We need some missiles and some infrastructure to act as a deterrent."" The Ashburton Shire is a member of the NWDA and will lobby for a new defence base at the coastal town of Onslow. Chief executive Ken Donohoe said advocating for the base was one of the council's key priorities this year. He said the proposed base would reduce Defence's reliance on the Henderson Naval Base more than 1,000 kilometres south in the Perth suburb Kwinana. He said the shire wanted a resupply point built at Onslow and claimed it could save Defence $6.1 million a year in fuel, food and human resources costs. Mr Donohoe said the idea had not been costed and there was no timeline for completion. ""It's an advocacy position, and council is identifying ... the assets that are available,"" he said. Northern Australia strategic policy expert John Coyne said the region was important to national security and forward planning was required. He commended the Shire of Ashburton's plan but said it was unlikely to be successful because the pre-existing facilities at Onslow were not appropriate. ""I'm not 100 per cent sure it makes total sense."" Despite this, Dr Coyne said the region was a ""connection point"" between Australia and the global economy and had strong potential for more defence facilities. ""It's got good strategic geography for both Australia and its allies to be able to operate across the region.""

90,As lithium prices rise this small seaside town is facing an influx of workers,business,"  Albemarle lithium processing plant just weeks from first production already looking to expand Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As lithium prices surge, US chemicals company Albemarle is considering a major expansion of its refinery 200 kilometres south of Perth, with plans for a 1,000-bed capacity workers' village. Albemarle is weeks away from first production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide at its Kemerton plant, just north of Bunbury. It has announced plans for a workers village in the nearby town of Binningup as it awaits a final investment decision on an expansion. The Kemerton-based refinery was originally set to produce 100,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide each year, but the output projection was halved in 2020 following a drop in lithium prices. An expansion is back on the cards as the price index for lithium hydroxide increased more than 400 per cent over the past year. Site director Daniel O'Shea said the company was looking at building a third and fourth processing train ""We're at an exciting time for Kemerton and the lithium industry,"" he said. ""We're actually looking at the next wave of growth investments that Albemarle can undertake, and included in that is trains three and four at site,"" he said. ""We haven't made a final investment decision as such, but we are certainly down the track."" Mr O'Shea said the company had experienced challenges in finding accommodation for the construction workforce while building the first stages of the Kemerton plant. ""Given the lack of accommodation availability in the short to medium term in the region, we're actually looking at our own solution to accommodate that future workforce for construction activities,"" he said. ""This will help lessen the burden on local accommodation and provide our workers with the support and benefits that village accommodation would offer."" The company is looking to lease land from local earthmoving company B and J Catalano, and a social impact assessment is being carried out. ""We're looking to see what end use, after the need for the construction, it could be. Whether it be aged care or other that this could fulfil,"" Mr O'Shea said. Residents are pushing to ensure the small seaside community sees long term benefits from the project, expressing concern that a large influx of workers will put further strain on the town. Binningup Caravan Park owner Jason Rule attended a consultation session yesterday. He said the community was uncertain. ""No-one really knows what we're going to end up with at the end of it all, and the effects it's going to have on the lifestyle on the people that live in the town,"" Mr Rule said. ""There's the potential for more antisocial behaviour. You've got an extra people that don't live in the area, they're really only here to make money and pack up and go home."" Harvey shire president Paul Gillett said discussions had been held with the company over the plan for the workers' village. ""We'd like to see this be a win-win, not only for Albemarle, but for the community and the shire,"" he said.

91,Sapphire F1 takes Southern 80 honours,business,"  Sapphire F1 takes Southern 80 honours as Echuca-Moama makes the most of smaller ski-race crowd Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The winners of this year's Southern 80 say it is the highlight of their careers. Sapphire F1 took line honours with a time of 30 minutes and 9 seconds to beat second-placed Superman by almost 50 seconds. The Superclass team was led by Echuca-based driver Tim Pickford and observer Brian Griffin, with Lachlan Nix and Aiden Cuff behind on the skis. Mr Pickford said there were a lot of tricky sections to navigate over the 80 kilometres of Murray River between the Torrumbarry Weir and the Victoria Park Boat ramp. ""It's a dream come true, we've been trying to win it for a long time. We did most of the hard work yesterday, picking up one of the boats so it made it a little bit easier yesterday,"" he said. ""The first half of the race was pretty calculated, but after that, it was a bit loose."" Mr Nix was one of the skiers behind Sapphire F1 and said the team had been working hard to get a win. ""We're rapt to be back out on the water and back out doing what we love,"" he said. ""We're not just mates on the water, but we're mates off the water and to get a win ... We've been going hard to get a win and we're pumped."" His co-skier Aiden Cuff has been skiing for 21 years and always dreamt of winning the Southern 80. ""But you never think that will happen to you,"" he said. ""To do it on our home track with the crew that we've got, it's everything we've ever wanted."" The team's win in 30:09.24 capped a safe weekend for the three-day event, which has been marred by fatalities and injuries on the waterin previous years. Echuca police commander, Acting Inspector David Bowler, said police were pleased with the behaviour of spectators this year but acknowledged there were fewer people to deal with, as crowd numbers were down. Usually, the Southern 80 is held in February at the end of summer but was postponed to May this year because of a shortage of emergency workers to man the event as they were tied up with the response to the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 pandemic. Victoria Police had a booze bus in Echuca and Rochester testing for drunk drivers on Sunday. New South Wales police said no incidents were recorded and Ambulance Victoria says two skiers were taken to Echuca hospital in a stable condition after crashing on Saturday. An Ambulance Victoria spokesman said a woman in her 30s fell from her skis and suffered upper body soreness, while a man in his 30s fell from his skis and suffered a leg injury. Kathryn McKenzie is the head of Echuca Moama Tourism and said the staging area at Victoria Park had been improved following works on the new Dhungala Bridge across the Murray River. ""The vibe was just amazing at the finish line,"" Ms McKenzie said. ""The new bridge has given us the new asphalt areas, it's given us the hard paths and the bridge is that new structure that really spans Echuca and Moama."" Daniel Kean runs the Wake ski shop in Echuca and said the town was expecting  fewer people this year because the race was run in May and not February. ""We only mainly do handles, and ski rope, and boots and the odd binding and repair for someone. Normal weekend, there's been no difference. We might sell a bit more gear to the camper but not the skiers 'cause they're more organised,"" he said. Rajan Sendhu runs the Pevensey Motor Lodge in Echuca and had all his 20 rooms booked out. ""It takes some extra staff, because normally if it's 60 per cent [full], so we need just three or four cleaners for the 20 rooms. We have to add a bit more,"" he said.

92,"'Once-a-year beer' tempts craft brew fans, fuels regional hop farm revival",business," ABC Rural WA craft brewer Boston Brewery creates wet hop beers to help sustain farms Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog WA craft breweries are experimenting with wet hop beers to tempt drinkers and help sustain farms in a region which lost its local hop industry decades ago. Boston Brewery head brewer Ben Bunker said he had a beer unlike any other, which was an achievement in an experimental industry where it was difficult to create something unique. He has made a wet hop beer using freshly harvested hops right off the bine rather than the dried and pelletised hops used in every other commercial variety. ""It's a bit of an ode to tradition,"" Mr Bunker said. ""Once upon a time all beer was made with fresh hops but they were only really good at that first time of the year when they were picked."" He said brewers would leave the hops hanging over rafters or pipework for the rest of the year. ""They would get this blue cheese or feet kind of smell and that would affect the quality of the beer as the year went on,"" he said. That issue led brewers to develop dried, pelletised hops which were used year-round. WA's commercial hop farms collapsed in the 1980s after Perth's Swan Brewery closed and the brand moved to South Australia. There were almost no hop farmers operating in the state for decades. WA hop farmer Trey Gee said the market completely fell out when Swan Brewery shifted their capacity to demanding pelletised hops in 1978. But a handful of commercial farmers have started selling to local craft breweries, including Aaron Alexander who has a small farm between Denmark and Albany. He picked his third hop harvest by hand in March. Drinkers were enjoying his produce a month later in the wet hop beer aptly labelled Cream of the Hops. ""The reason we started growing hops was basically to offer local breweries fresh local hops because they can't get them from interstate,"" Mr Alexander said. ""The breweries are starting to acknowledge there are local hops now."" He said locally-grown hops offered different flavours and aromas. ""Hopefully with time, it will become normal to see WA hops in our beers,"" he said. Brewers at the hundreds of craft breweries scattered across regional Australia can have a tough time creating beers that stand out. Wet hop beers grown, harvested and brewed in the same region are a way to create something unique without turning to aggressive flavours or additives. ""People often expect a wet hop beer to be super hoppy, like a hop bomb,"" Mr Alexander said. ""It's generally more subtle, more rounded and fresher."" Mr Alexander said he loved that wet hop beer tasted ""like the harvest"". Meanwhile, Mr Bunker said he looked forward to using something hyper-local. ""It's really good to be proud of something from the area that excites people,"" Mr Bunker said. ""The first question we often get is 'oh, we do hops here'?"" Bartender Callum McCamley said the beer attracted a diverse range of customers. ""Everybody wants to try it,"" Mr McCamley said. ""I personally have sold mainly to people in their 30s."" He said customers tended to have ""a really good knowledge of beer"". ""In fact, a lot of young ladies now are really enjoying the craft beers,"" he said. ""It's good to see a lot of young people enjoying something different at the pub."" A tasting event was planned in Perth in April to celebrate wet hop beers grown and brewed in WA's south-west region but it was cancelled after COVID-19 restrictions were introduced in WA. Mr Alexander said growers were eager to promote the harvest again next year with more wet hop varieties. Until then, the remainder of his 2022 harvest has been dried and pelletised for use in local breweries' less time-sensitive offerings.

93,Major $25m hotel proposed for Albany tourist hotspot,business,"  Major $25m hotel proposed for Albany tourist hotspot Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An eight-storey, 66-room hotel is proposed for one of Western Australia's south coast's most popular tourist spots. The $25 million Middleton Beach Seashells hotel has been in the planning pipeline for more than a decade after the former hotel at the site, the Esplanade Hotel, was demolished in 2007. Preliminary plans have been lodged with state planners in a major step. The hotel will rise to eight storeys at its rear, facing Mt Adelaide, while the beachfront end will be two storeys. Proponent Collab Capital's Evan Campbell said the design would be sympathetic to the area and feature 66 suites designed to draw families and professionals south. ""We'll be respecting the beachfront with two levels and then stepping back to eight storeys,"" he said. ""It's not going to be overdeveloped for the site – it's going to be appropriate."" A 12-storey plan was proposed last decade but drew heavy criticism from locals. The proposal will go through WA's fast-track planning pipeline, introduced by the state government to help speed up major projects during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr Campbell said the development was moving ""full steam ahead"", with construction expected to start later this year. ""If we start [construction in] October or November, with supply challenges and labour challenges in WA, it'll take about 18 months to build,"" he said. The design would also include public access to the two-storey section. ""We want to propose something upmarket for Albany, in terms of a bar and brasserie with a rooftop level on the second level for patrons and the public to go and get better views of the water,"" he said. It comes after the city's first major hotel, a Hilton Garden Inn, opened last year at the marina with 108 rooms.

94,"Biden names envoy to SE Asia bloc, stressing US commitment to the region",business,"  President Joe Biden names envoy to ASEAN bloc, stressing US commitment to South-East Asia Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog US President Joe Biden has announced he's nominating one of his top national security aides as ambassador to the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), aiming to underscore his administration's commitment to the Pacific region. Mr Biden announced his decision to nominate Yohannes Abraham, chief of staff to the White House National Security Council, to serve as the US representative to the 10-country bloc as he wrapped up talks with leaders of ASEAN, who gathered in Washington for a two-day ""special summit"". Mr Biden's efforts to put greater emphasis on the Pacific region have been overtaken in recent months by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. With his nomination of an ambassador to ASEAN — the US is currently represented by a chargé d’affaires — the President sought to send the message that he's serious about recalibrating American foreign policy to have greater focus on Asia and to strengthen the US role as a counterweight to China's rapid rise in the region. Mr Biden described Mr Abraham as one of his closest advisers. ""I'm a little concerned to send him because he knows how I think. He knows so much about me,"" Mr Biden joked with the ASEAN leaders about Mr Abraham. ""But all kidding aside, I think you're going to find him completely knowledgeable, and he speaks for me and he speaks for my administration."" Mr Abraham's nomination, which requires Senate confirmation, came after the White House announced on Thursday that the United States would commit more than $150 million for new projects to bolster South-East Asia’s climate, maritime and public health infrastructure. Earlier on Friday, Vice-President Kamala Harris met with the ASEAN leaders and underscored that ""the United States and ASEAN have shared a vision for this region, and together will guard against threats to international rules and norms"". That comment, during a session that focused in part on freedom of the seas, appeared to reference China's increasingly aggressive military actions in the South China Sea and beyond. China has stepped up its military presence in the South China Sea in recent years, as well as the East China Sea, where a dispute about uninhabited islets administered by Japan but claimed by China has been a long-simmering issue. This week, Australian Defence Forces tracked what was dubbed a Chinese spy ship along the West coast of Australia. Defence Minister Peter Dutton described the situation as unprecedented, adding the ship was on a mission ""to collect intelligence right along the coastline"". Ms Harris said: ""We stand with our allies and partners in defending the maritime rules-based order, which includes freedom of navigation and international law."" Mr Biden has increased attention to improving relations with Pacific nations in his presidency, as he and top national security officials have made clear they see a rising China as the most threatening economic and national security adversary to the United States. Mr Biden in his remarks to the leaders at the State Department said that strengthening the US relationship with ASEAN is ""at the very heart"" of his foreign policy strategy. “An Indo-Pacific that is free and open, stable and prosperous, and resilient and secure is what we're all seeking,"" Mr Biden said. The ASEAN nations whose leaders attended the summit are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The top leaders from ASEAN member Myanmar were barred, while outgoing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte dispatched Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr to represent his government. The summit came just before Mr Biden’s trip next week to South Korea and Japan  his first visit to Asia as President. He'll hold talks with those two countries' leaders and also meet during the trip with leaders from the Indo-Pacific strategic alliance known as the Quad, made up of Australia, India and Japan in addition to the US. Ms Harris told the ASEAN leaders the Biden administration ""recognises the vital strategic importance"" of the bloc. She said: ""The United States will be present and continue to be engaged in South-East Asia for generations to come.""

95,Five crashes in two weeks prompt warnings for caravanners heading west,business,"  Outback Queensland traffic authorities record five incidents in two weeks, prompting police warning Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Lindsay Liston knew what was about to happen before it unfolded before his eyes. As he drove his empty delivery truck back to Charleville, he watched a car towing a caravan try to overtake him while he sat at a speed of 90 kilometres per hour. ""It started swaying, I think she might have panicked and hit the brakes a bit,"" Mr Liston said. ""[The caravan] ended up spinning right around, the caravan hit a culvert, and went over into the culvert. ""But the car stayed upright, luckily."" Mr Liston pulled over to check on the travellers, where they stayed for more than an hour on the Matilda Highway, waiting for someone to come and assist. ""I wouldn't have liked to be in it, looked pretty scary,"" Mr Liston said. ""[I] helped them unload, they got a bit of gear out of it, because the caravan, there was nothing left of it, it made a big mess."" It was not the only incident involving caravans in recent weeks in western Queensland. Charleville's Queensland Fire and Emergency Service (QFES) area commander John Fogarty said that, of five recent road crashes in the region, three involved caravans. ""Some of these incidents probably could have been avoided,"" he said. ""Speed, fatigue, caravans that have been incorrectly loaded, and probably some inexperienced new people getting into the industry, going out to buy that new van and the four-wheel-drive to head off to the west [have been involved]."" He said that, while the influx of tourists and visitors to outback Queensland was beneficial for the region's economy, safety had to be the top priority. ""I'd suggest that you get a little bit of training in and around your caravan — how to tow your van, and certainly how to pack your van to make sure it's correctly packed and it's well balanced,"" he said. He also recommended keeping a close eye on road conditions, from checking Facebook groups, Transport and Main Roads (TMR) and RACQ websites, as well as talking to locals in outback towns. In more remote parts of the country, the commander said being aware of who has right of way was highly important. ""Road trains do not get off the side of the road, they're way too big and there's too much risk,"" he said. ""So as car drivers, or caravan drivers, we need to ensure that we slow down, move to the side and give them plenty of room."" Mr Liston agreed training on how to correctly tow and weight a caravan should be a priority before heading out west on a road trip. ""Just take it steady,"" Mr Liston said. ""You're not in a hurry, you're on holidays. You should be just poking along."" ABC Western Qld will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

96,Government minister admits first home buyer policy would push up house prices,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Minister for Superannuation Jane Hume has conceded the Coalition's recently announced first home buyer policy would increase house prices ""temporarily"". Some economists say it would only push up house prices and would not address affordability Superannuation Minister Jane Hume says a number of other factors influence house prices Scott Morrison says other government policies will minimise any potential impact on house prices The campaign promise to allow first home buyers to dip into their super to help pay for a home deposit has been criticised by economists and the opposition as a policy that would only drive up house prices further. Under the plan, people who have saved a 5 per cent deposit will be able to access up to 40 per cent of their superannuation, capped at $50,000, but must return the amount taken out, plus capital gains, if they sell the house. ""We know that people will probably bring forward some of their decisions to buy a house earlier and for that reason it will probably push prices temporarily,"" Senator Hume said. When asked how much prices would rise, Senator Hume said there were always a number of factors that drove price increases. ""What we know that interest rates play a big effect, housing supply plays an enormous effect, that’s why it’s important to play all ends,"" she said. Mr Morrison said any impact on house prices would be cancelled out by the Coalition's other policy pitch to encourage older Australians to downsize. ""The balance of policies we have … means we're freeing up housing stock with our downsizing policy,"" he said. ""We think [this] minimises any potential impact on house prices."" The policy of allowing people to access their super has been tossed around for years without much luck. It was floated back in 2017 when Scott Morrison was treasurer and dismissed by then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who in 2021 called it ""the craziest idea I've heard"". Economist Saul Eslake said the Coalition scheme would do nothing to address the root causes of housing affordability. ""My initial reaction was that I wanted to scream that this reckless inflation of house prices must stop,"" he said. ""Anything which allows Australians to pay more for housing than they otherwise would, which this scheme undoubtedly does, results primarily in more expensive housing, rather than in more people owning that housing."" ""It will be greeted with despair by those would be first home buyers who will see it rightly as pushing their dreams further out of their reach than they already are."" Brendan Coates from the Grattan institute agreed that while the scheme would increase house prices in the short term, the long-term impact would be modest. But he said it would only help people who were already likely to buy a house to spend more. ""Because what you have in super is proportionate to the income that you earn,"" Mr Coates said. ""A lot of low-income earners, people for whom getting into the housing market is a struggle, this scheme may not benefit a lot of them all that much, because they don't actually accumulate that much super."" Fresh from a late-campaign image reboot, Scott Morrison, behind in the pools and with flailing personal popularity, uses his campaign launch to elevate those who will serve alongside him, hoping to pull off another unexpected election win, writes Brett Worthington. Mr Coates said the poorest 20 per cent of 35- to 44-year-olds had a median super balance of zero, and for the next 20 per cent the balance was $15,000. ""The main effect of the policy would probably be to allow people on reasonable incomes that are already good chance to buy a home, to buy a better home, and probably push up prices a little bit in the process."" But Mr Sukkar said the average 30-34-year-old would be able to take out about $20,000. ""We think this will be really popular for those people on those more modest incomes who find it increasingly difficult to save for a deposit as well as paying rent and all the other costs of living that that people have to meet every day,"" he said. ""Of course, you need to have a superannuation balance to access it, that's the point. It's allowing people to access their money."" Mr Coates said neither of the major parties were addressing housing affordability in this election. ""I think another sign of our diminished ambitions on housing affordability [can be seen] in this election campaign,"" he said. ""What we've seen from both parties is policies that tinker around the edges, will help some people into home ownership, but we're not willing to tackle the underlying drivers of why housing is so unaffordable in the first place. ""We're not willing to do things that would unsettle existing home owners by seeing prices and rents fall."" Mr Eslake was also cynical in his analysis of the housing policy offers during this election campaign. ""There are far more votes to be had in policies that keep house prices going up, as this policy will do, than there are in policies which would restrain the rate of growth in house prices,"" he said. The real estate, housing and building industries, including Real Estate Institute of Australia president Hayden Groves, have welcomed the Coalition's policy. ""The tension between superannuation and housing need not be there, as the government's own Retirement Income Review shows that home ownership is a fundamental pillar for a successful retirement,"" Mr Groves said. ""The Super Home Buyer Scheme strikes the right balance of addressing affordability and building retirement savings with a requirement for the super plus capital gains to be returned on the sale of the home."" But Glen McCrea, deputy CEO of the peak body for superannuation, Association of Super Funds Australia, criticised the idea. ""This isn't a policy that is going to solve housing affordability,"" Mr McCrea said. ""The reality here is super is about providing income in retirement. Tackling housing affordability is a different policy issue. ""There have been numerous reviews into super in the last decade. None of them have recommended this policy. In fact, many of them have described it as being a bad idea."" ""The super system is designed to provide income in retirement. It isn't designed as a scheme to break glass and take it out for other purposes.""

97,'It was really viewed as something special': Former Abel Tasman ferry embarks on its final journey,business,"  Former Tasmanian ferry Abel Tasman sets sail to be scrapped in Turkey Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Once celebrated by thousands of Tasmanians when it arrived on our shores in 1985, the time has come for the former Abel Tasman ferry to make its final journey. News outlets in Greece — where the ship has been moored since 2015 — have reported the ferry, now called Theofilos, is on its way to Turkey to be demolished for scrap metal. When the TT-line's new commercial ferry, German-built Abel Tasman, arrived in Devonport, Tasmania, in 1985, it received a hero's welcome. ""It was such a huge leap forward from its predecessor,"" said Mitchell Bruce, creator of the Ferries in Tasmania website. The Abel Tasman replaced the Empress of Australia, which used to provide three crossings per fortnight between Tasmania and the mainland. It also marked the beginning of the corporation TT-Line operating ferry services across the Bass Strait. The Abel Tasman increased the crossings to six weekly overnight crossings between Devonport and Melbourne, with passenger numbers surpassing expectations. This ship maintained the service until 1993, when it was replaced by the much larger Spirit of Tasmania. Once providing a link to the mainland for many Tasmanians and visitors or new residents, news of the ferry's final voyage stirred up nostalgia for readers of the ABC Hobart Facebook page. School trips to Tasmania, moving states, band tours and even a proposal mid-journey — Tasmanians shared their memories with us of the Abel Tasman during its heyday. ""Played aboard with my band Wild Pumpkins at Midnight in exchange for our fares to Melbourne on our first mainland tour in 1986… there was lots of rolling, and we couldn't stand to play double bass!"" Michael Turner said. ""My husband proposed to me on it, in the middle of Bass Strait!"" Tammy Cranfield said. ""We sailed back on it after being caught in Queensland when Ansett collapsed,"" Anne Mitchell said. ""The boat was full with people sleeping everywhere — even on the floor of the main public area — not a square inch of space left!"" In 1990, the Tasmanian government announced the Abel Tasman would be replaced by a larger ferry, Peter Pan, which was renamed The Spirit of Tasmania. The Abel Tasman was later sold to a Greek shipping company called Ventouris Ferries in 1994, leaving Tasmania for the last time. Over the course of the ship's life in Greece, it was plagued by mechanical troubles and changes in service across the Greek island's domestic routes. In 1995, the ship crashed into the Greek port of Chios after a mechanical failure meant it entered the port at full speed, crushing a car and causing significant damage. In 2008, the ship struck a reef while operating between Piraeus to Chios, causing flood damage to parts of the ship. When Mitchell Bruce heard the Abel Tasman was leaving Greece to be scrapped in Turkey, he had mixed feelings. ""It's a little bit sad… but it's been decaying for so long it's probably a better move in the long run,"" he said. Mitchell said he was told by contacts in Greece that there was hope that the ship would be purchased and upgraded, but due to the cost that hope faded quickly. The Abel Tasman hasn't been in Tasmanian waters for more than 30 years, but it's clear the ship's mark on Tasmania was significant. One Tasmanian recalled sailing on the ship while she was in Greece in 2000, only realising when she was aboard. ""I realised it was the old Abel Tasman because it still had photos of Cradle Mountain and Tasmania's wilderness throughout it! Caused me a bit of confusion,"" they said. Mitchell Bruce said while the ship will no longer sail the waters of Europe, it will forever be part of Tasmania's rich shipping history. ""It was really viewed as something special.""

98,'We are not going to be silent': Former students battle dishonest employers who dodge debts,business,"  Former students' fight for unpaid wages highlights loophole in Australia's legal system Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Kajal Limbachiya says she would sometimes sleep on the couch at the Indian restaurant where she worked when she had insufficient breaks between her shifts. At the start of 2020, the then-24-year-old international student from India was unaware she was about to face the toughest time of her life. ""But I survived,"" Ms Limbachiya said. For $10 an hour she worked day and night shifts, doing a range of tasks including cooking, waitressing, and other odd jobs. When she finished at 4am and had to work again at 10:30am, she said she slept at the restaurant in Melbourne because it wasn't worth going home. Ms Limbachiya was also struggling financially because her employer wasn't paying her properly — she was owed nearly $15,000 in wages and superannuation when the pandemic hit in March. The lockdown also meant she couldn't easily switch jobs. Ms Limbachiya said she couldn't afford food, rent or university fees and spiralled into depression. ""If he gave me that money, I would not have suffered this much,"" she said. Two years on, the 26-year-old still has not been paid, despite a court ordering her employer to pay her what she is owed. Ms Limbachiya's experience shows how the legal system makes it hard for vulnerable workers to get back ""small claims"" — unpaid wages and entitlements up to $20,000. ""At the moment there must be so many court orders that have been made in this space, small claims applications relating to unpaid employment entitlements, that have just been Pyrrhic victories,"" her lawyer Gabrielle Marchetti said. A ""Pyrrhic victory"" is an empty victory, where the winner loses more in total than what they gain. Vaishnavi Lella and Vineeth Kuddigana also worked at the Indian restaurant in early 2020 and were underpaid. Like Ms Limbachiya, Ms Lella had verbally agreed to be paid $10 per hour, less than the minimum wage, because it was hard to find work at the time. Ms Lella said after two weeks she had not received the total amount of pay she was owed, so asked her boss for the outstanding amount. She said he replied with: ""How much do you need?"" For further information visit the Fair Work Ombudsman site. Ms Lella left the job after about one month and started looking for help to recover the $3,200 in wages and super she was owed. She contacted the international student representative at Swinburne University, where she was studying a master's degree in construction management. They put her in contact with employment legal rights service JobWatch. ""There are international student mentors in all the universities,"" Ms Lella said. ""They [can act] like a bridge … to introduce you to a lawyer or to a community service legal centre,"" she said, adding it was a free service. In court proceedings, OzeeOze Pty Ltd, a private company owned by Shoukath Ali Mohammed, was recognised as the Indian students' employer rather than Mr Mohammed himself, which is an important distinction. Mr Mohammed, who was the students' boss at the time, told the ABC he did not dispute the court orders. He confirmed staff slept at the restaurant but said he provided accommodation to workers when they needed help. When asked why staff were paid $10 an hour, Mr Mohammed said he had put a lot of his own money into the restaurant and the students were not forced to accept that pay rate. He said his restaurant, which is now closed, had also suffered because of the pandemic. JobWatch's principal lawyer Gabrielle Marchetti is no stranger to tracking down ""unscrupulous employers"", as she calls them. Sometimes her work, like many lawyers at community legal centres, involves ""playing a private detective"". Such was the case when Ms Marchetti had to find an employer who ""suddenly disappeared"" during negotiations in another underpayment case involving three international students. The Colombian students were engaged by a sole trader to work as commercial cleaners and verbally accepted to work for $20 an hour. Despite working a combined 522 hours, they had only been paid a total of $740 and no superannuation. Earlier this year, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia ruled in favour of the three Indian students and three Colombian students, in the two separate cases. The court ordered compensation of a combined $50,000 for unpaid wages, superannuation and other entitlements. ""But, again, at the end of the day, none of them has actually received the money that they're owed,"" Ms Marchetti said. ""If a dishonest or shameless respondent ignores the court order and simply doesn't pay, the enforcement process is really complicated."" The six students, who have since all graduated, now have to decide if they want to take further action, which would likely involve hiring sheriff's officers to seize assets from the employer – assets that may not even exist. ""The sheriff has to physically turn up at whatever address each applicant gives the sheriff and then seize any assets that are in that particular entity's name,"" Ms Marchetti said. The wages recovery process is further complicated by a legal precedent in small claims matters, where the court only has the power to order the employer to pay compensation, not a third party, like the individual who owns the company. Ms Marchetti said JobWatch was attempting to get that precedent overturned in court using ""strategic litigation"". ""If we are successful with these legal proceedings, the court will be able to make orders in small claims matters not only against the employer but also against any third party who was knowingly involved in the underpayment,"" she said. This would help address a loophole in the small claims enforcement process, where the owner of a company can shift assets from the company to another account to avoid paying any debts — like unpaid wages. ""I am concerned that even if our poor clients now fork out the money to send the sheriff around to seize assets from the company that employed them … the sheriff may find it's only a shelf company, with no assets in its name,"" she said. ""The lesson there for other workers, particularly young workers, is to speak up quickly if you don't think you're being paid properly."" Mr Mohammed confirmed to the ABC that the employer of the Indian students — OzeeOze Pty Ltd — does not currently have any assets in its name. In addition to enforcement complexities, Sharmilla Bargon, coordinator of the Employment Rights Legal Service, said the process of lodging a small claim can be difficult for vulnerable workers. Ms Bargon said these workers can be ""locked out"" of the process of recovering unpaid wages because of language barriers and ""the complexities of navigating the system"". ""Or … because they are fearful about speaking out about employers and putting their visa at risk,"" she said. ""The process of completing the relevant court forms, performing complex underpayment calculations and self-representing in court is not only prohibitively complicated, it is also unfortunately not a quick fix."" The federal government removes working-hour caps on international students, allowing more people to help fill worker shortages caused by the Omicron outbreak. A small claims application can take months or longer, but Ms Bargon said the process was meant to be a faster and cheaper way to recover wages. “One of the key attractions is that you do not need a lawyer to represent you, which is important if your claim is under $20,000 because legal fees can quickly outstrip the size of the claim,"" she said. Small claims can be filed in either the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, or in state or territory local, magistrates, or industrial relations courts. Claims for unpaid wages and entitlements over $20,000 are made through the courts but don't use the small claims process. A Fair Work Ombudsman guide on small claims suggests getting legal advice for larger unpaid wages claims. Ms Marchetti said those claims require more legal expertise, but individuals can be named in those court actions and employers can face penalties, like fines. Not every employer underpaying staff will go to great lengths to avoid paying debts. Teresa Alvarez's employer did pay her after a court order. Ms Alvarez came to Australia on a student visa with her husband and daughter in 2019, and the couple worked for a cleaning company in Mulgrave in Melbourne's south-east. They quit their jobs after they were underpaid and contacted JobWatch who took the employer to court. The Federal Circuit Court found in their favour and the cleaning company was ordered to pay the couple about $5,500 in unpaid wages and entitlements. Ms Alvarez said she was initially reluctant to take legal action because she was on a student visa at the time and was worried that it could impact her visa. ""If you go to Australia as a student, with your visa in order, the main right you have is to be respected like any Australian worker,"" she said. Katrina was excited to return to campus once Australia's international border reopened — but fellow international students have grown tired of the government's delays. A Fair Work Ombudsman spokesperson said the ombudsman has an agreement with the Department of Home Affairs, called the Assurance Protocol, where visa holders can ask for help without fear of their visa being cancelled for breaches of their work-related visa conditions. Despite the complications, Vaishnavi Lella said students should still take action against dishonest employers. ""Those employers should be punished,"" she said. She said if enough students spoke out about being exploited at work, the system would eventually change. ""I would urge other students to speak out. We are not going to be silent."" Youth Law Australia senior lawyer Anastasia Coroneo said while young workers were particularly vulnerable to exploitation, there was support available. ""Our service assists all young people under 25 across Australia to give free legal advice,"" she said. Ms Marchetti said there were many ways to improve the law for vulnerable workers. In addition to changing who can be sued in a small claim, she said the enforcement process for court orders needed to be simplified. ""There isn't one uniform, simple process to follow across Australia,"" she said. ""Enforcement of court orders is complicated, it's expensive and it's little wonder so many of our clients think it's all too hard and give up. ""This is a real access to justice issue."" Ms Bargon pointed out that a Senate Committee in March recommended that the Federal Government establish a small claims tribunal, ideally co-located with the Fair Work Commission, to create a simple, affordable, accessible, and efficient process for employees to pursue wage theft, including unpaid superannuation.

99,Businesses aren't going broke. Experts are worried it will create a bigger problem,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As the pandemic roared in during early 2020, rapid and astonishing shifts were made to prop up an economy sledgehammered by lockdowns, restrictions and fear. 'Safe harbour' insolvency laws were written to protect companies unable to predict future turnover. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) stopped pursuing debts as the pandemic unfolded. Tens of billions of dollars in stimulus were pumped into the economy. And, as a result, businesses stopped going broke. However, even as the economy recovers to a new kind of normal, the number of businesses going into administration each year is thousands below pre-pandemic levels. ""There are definitely businesses that, in ordinary times, would have gone under that were able to continue trading,"" Scott Mason of credit reporting agency Equifax says. However, the drought of insolvencies doesn't mean that companies are necessarily doing better. Instead, there are distressed companies still operating that should have been killed off long ago — taking people's money even as they circle the drain. And Scott Mason says that's a big problem for their customers and suppliers. ""The real issue is you don't, as a normal consumer, always know who those companies are … so I think there is some danger to people who enter into business with them."" Since 2020, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) hasn't been chasing outstanding debts. That knock on the door is often the trigger for a company to enter administration, so there's been a drought of insolvencies, a slump so stark many insolvency practitioners had to access the JobKeeper wage subsidy themselves to keep their doors open. Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) data reveals that in the two-and-a-quarter years since the pandemic began in Australia, just 10,530 businesses have entered administration. That's fewer than went under in the separate financial years of 2008, 2011 or 2012. The 10-year average of companies going into administration is 9,300 a year. ""I think, over the coming months, we will start to see some movement in insolvency,"" says Robyn Esrkine, partner of insolvency firm Brooke Bird, ""and I think that's going to be upwards."" She says law changes, programs like JobKeeper and the ATO giving companies a reprieve from paying tax debts changed the usual cycle of business that sees almost 10,000 go under in a normal year. ""But we're back, we're operating in a COVID economy and businesses need to be viable to be able to contribute to the economy."" That means a likely increase in companies going into insolvency, Ms Erskine says. ""I think that those businesses that haven't been able to pay their debt — and we know that there is a lot of unpaid taxes, there was a lot going into COVID — those businesses now are going to be asked to pay."" In the ATO's 2020-21 annual report, total debt was $58.8 billion, and just 65 per cent of that — $38.5 billion — was ""collectable"", meaning likely to be paid. Most of that owed, achievable debt is owed by small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). Previously, secret documents revealed public and media pressure stopped the tax office going harder in pursing debts owed by small businesses struggling through the COVID-19 pandemic. Freedom of information documents reveal tax leniency was shown to small businesses with debts during the pandemic, but now the ATO is changing its tune. The reports — obtained using the Freedom of Information (FOI) process — reveal the ATO set up a softer approach during COVID, sending text messages, sending blue rather than ""firmer"" orange letters, and a move away from ""stronger action"" in ""favour (of) help and assistance"" for small business. However, the amnesty is now over. The tax office wants its money. Also revealed in the documents, a successful threat to dob in companies with tax debts to credit-reporting agencies, which could cause those companies' clients to stop doing business with them. ""The outcome we are seeking is behavioural change and engagement rather than actual disclosure,"" the document reads, outlining the gambit. It worked. Notices of the threat were sent to 70 companies in August last year. All but one paid up, a total of $6.5 million came in, and no companies were dobbed in. As of August 31, 2021, the tax office had issued 842,845 reminder letters, with around 55 per cent of them going to small business. At the time of contacting the ATO for this article, it had sent out letters warning about outstanding debts to 29,552 businesses. A further 52,319 letters warning about the potential for Director Penalty Notices (DPNs) were sent to people in charge of these companies. Tax commissioner Chris Jordan told senators in February that the ATO was taking a measured approach. ""We are concerned that the longer businesses stay out of engagement with us, the more problematic the collection of those debts is,"" he told the Senate. ""It is something we cannot just ignore, because the debt stock has gone up about 14 per cent from the same time last year and is now around $40 billion. ""We have to focus in as empathetic way as we can, but it is something we just have to get on with."" Scott Mason is general manager of commercial and property services at Equifax, one of the companies that would have been ""dobbed to"" had the ATO's gambit been unsuccessful. He sees danger ahead as companies that should have gone under a long time ago are forced to wind up. ""A lot of those companies continue to survive where, ordinarily, they may well have gone under,"" he says. In the past two years there's been a lot of discussion of so-called ""zombie businesses"", artificially propped-up by the JobKeeper wage subsidy, low interest rates and the tax debt moratorium. Now rates are rising and those supports are gone, so the pressure is on. Mr Mason says small operators are dipping into their personal finances, a sign of growing stress. ""Looking at sole traders, small proprietors, sort of those 'smaller-end-of-town' operators, [they] are twice as likely to have their personal mortgages in arrears as the general population. ""So, clearly, there's some pressure down at that end of the market."" The problem is acute in the construction industry. Iconic firm Grocon collapsed in 2020 and this year mega-builder ProBuild — with its $5 billion pipeline of work — fell over. Since then, ABD Group, Privium Home, Condev and, most recently, Next, went under. Building costs have risen so much that one construction professional says he goes to work every day knowing he'll ""disappoint at least one person"". Equifax data suggests that, while the overall rate of insolvencies in March 2022 was up 5 per cent on last year, construction insolvencies were 28 per cent higher. In the first quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2021, 270 construction companies filled for insolvency, a 21 per cent jump. Stretched global supply chains have fed into soaring costs for materials. Ongoing border closers boosted a hot labour market, meaning tradespeople have been charging more. ""It's created a 'profitless boom', with many construction companies committed to projects that are no longer financially viable, thanks to major price increases for building materials,"" Mr Mason says. Anneke Thompson, the chief economist for credit reporting firm CreditorWatch, agrees. ""Over the last few years margins have really compressed,"" she says. ""The risk profile of the whole construction sector is worsening."" The issue with construction is that intense competition meant some companies won contracts that left them with only thin profit margins. With skyrocketing costs — and being unable to recoup them — they're losing money on the deals. ""Fixed pricing is a real problem for the sector,"" she says. ""In other industries, when their costs rise or fall, they can change their pricing. ""You see the evidence of that at the supermarket. When you buy fruit and vegetables, the prices are changing, based on their costs. ""The construction industry can't do that."" The danger for consumers — and people working in construction — is that it's often hard to tell if a company is in trouble, until it's too late. ""It's difficult to see from the outside,"" Ms Thompson says. ""A lot of these businesses will look like they're operating normally: They'll be paying their wages, they'll be keeping the lights on. But their balance sheets and their financial position might be very stressed."" Research from CreditorWatch suggests the hospitality and entertainment industries are currently the sectors with companies at the greatest risk of default, ahead of even construction. For OptiPay chief executive Angus Sedgwick, a surge in new customers is a sign companies are stretched. ""Particularly, the construction industry is under pressure because of, obviously, the supply chain issues and the inflationary pressure that [have] caused increases in the cost of materials,"" Mr Sedgwick says. ""And many of these builders and developers have entered into fixed-price contracts, so that they've got to absorb all these increases in costs."" However, Mr Sedgwick is confident the tax office will take slow steps. ""They won't have just come through these last two-and-a-half years of the pandemic to then suddenly wind everyone up. But if you don't be proactive, that's what will end up happening over the next six, eight months."" OptiPay is in the business of invoice financing. Here's how that works: Dave's Concreting has done a job for a big client and is owed $10,000 in two months. An invoice financing company buys the debt, pays Dave 90 per cent of it in cash immediately and eventually receives the invoice's value, profiting from the 10 per cent leftover. It's very common in the US and UK, and is a long-standing way for companies to improve their cash flow that helps to get money coming in more quickly to balance payments going out. ""If you are selling your goods or services on credit, you're effectively giving your goods or services away for free for that credit period,"" Mr Sedgwick explains. But it's not without controversy, most recently the focus was on the collapse of globe-trotting firm Greensill Capital. The increasing popularity of this type of business goes some way to explaining why the victims of corporate collapses in the field of construction are often small-to-medium-sized subcontracting companies — ""subbies"" — that are not household names. ""Most subcontractors — whether they be plumbers, chippies, whatever they might be — generally have two to three months of their own expenses into a job before they put in their progress claim,"" Mr Sedgwick explains. ""So they're always running about two to three months of expenses and bills and subcontractors' wages, etc., that they've got to fund before the debtor — whoever that may be, that they're doing the work for — actually pays them."" The model means the subbies are outlaying money — services, staff and supplies — and relying on companies to pay them months after the costs have been sunk. ""If, in the month of May, they put their progress claim in, that will get paid in mid-July. So, typically, there's two to three months of a subbies work in a job before they received the payment for it."" This means a host of small companies can spend a lot of money before the music stops and things fall apart. Equifax's Scott Mason is confident about what will unfold as the tax office restarts its normal business collecting revenue owed to it. ""What you have seen is — on the good side — you've got still a lot of availability of funds [and] people are still trying to lend. We've got a lot of good consumer confidence still, and business confidence in the market,"" he says. Ms Erskine — who sits on the board of INSOL, a world-wide federation of insolvency experts — is not bracing for a rush of troubled companies. ""I think it might be a slow burn,"" she says, seeing the turnover of unviable firms as a healthy part of the economic cycle. ""These zombie businesses suck resources,"" she argues. ""So, it is in everyone's interest that viable businesses are supported, that they have an even playing ground — that they're not competing against businesses who are not paying their taxes and not paying their employees — for our country to move forward and prosper, which is what we all want.""

100,Australia's longest road tunnel to cut travel times along Great Western Highway,business,"  Blue Mountains to get Australia's longest road tunnel, promises of reduced travel times Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The NSW government has committed to building Australia's longest road tunnel in the Blue Mountains. An 11-kilometre tunnel from Blackheath to Little Hartley has been confirmed as the preferred option in the Great Western Highway upgrades to improve travel across the mountains. The highway is one of only two roads across the Blue Mountains connecting the central west with the state's capital, and communities in western areas have long called for an upgrade. The state government had previously committed to building two smaller tunnels across well-known choke points at Blackheath and Mount Victoria but started investigating the possibility of one longer tunnel last year. The tunnel will be part of the now $8 billion Great Western Highway upgrade which is set to duplicate the 34km of road from Lithgow to Katoomba with dual carriageways. Deputy Premier Paul Toole said the tunnel and upgrades would take 30 minutes off travel times ""on a good day"". ""This is going to make a huge difference for people travelling to and from the central west and also through the mountains,"" he said. The tunnel is set to travel 100 metres underneath Mount Victoria and 30 metres below Blackheath. ""It's exciting to know that this project is going to become a reality … for a long time this project has been put in the too-hard basket,"" Mr Toole said. Construction on the road is set to start in early 2023 with work on the tunnel section to start at the end of 2024 and be operational by 2027/28. The project has raised serious concerns about Aboriginal heritage and platypus populations in the Lithgow region.

101,"Musicians and crowds rock out in rain, mud at Lismore flood relief concert",business,"  Grinspoon and Paul Kelly play to thousands at Lismore's flood relief concert Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog They are as sick and tired of mud and rain as they could possibly be, but that has not stopped thousands of Northern NSW residents from pulling on their gumboots and ponchos for a charity flood relief concert in Lismore. More than 10,000 people from flood-affected parts of the region signed up for free tickets to the Sunday concert at the still-slushy Lismore showgrounds. Artists included Paul and Dan Kelly, Daryl Braithwaite, Jon Stevens, Lime Cordiale and home-grown band Grinspoon. Lismore Mayor Steve Krieg said the day was to give people a small reprieve from the problems they faced recovering from the floods. ""Everyone's got major, major issues at the moment — be it financial, rebuilding, jobs, businesses,"" he said. ""It's just a good day to chill out, relax, listen to some amazing music and just be together."" The One From the Heart tickets were allocated within hours of being released and many residents hoping to score passes missed out. Mr Krieg said he anticipated some people would not use their allocated passes, and people staffing the gates would use their discretion to let other residents in. ""If people who are [flood] affected want to come in that don't actually have a ticket, obviously we're human, we're not heartless, we'll use our discretion to make sure that everyone who wants to be here is here as much as possible,"" he said. Grinspoon guitarist Pat Davern said it felt amazing to be able to give something back to Lismore during such a tough time. ""Hopefully it can go some way to repairing some of that mental and physical damage that's been done during this time,"" Davern said. ""We went and had a look at the house Phil and I used to live in when we wrote all those Grinspoon songs and that went under. It was supposed to be flood-proof."" Davern said he knew people were taking a close look at how Lismore could be protected from floods in the future, but he hoped it would remain a ""hotbed of creativity"". ""Sure it's a low socio-economic area, but a lot of artists and musicians and people like that are drawn to this part of Lismore and unfortunately this is the part of Lismore that gets so heavily affected by the floods,"" he said of the flood-prone areas. ""It's cheaper to live here but there's more going on and it would be devastating to lose that."" All of the artists playing the concert were gifted banners that had the details of the concert embroidered on them. Flags and banners showing a red heart on a white background have become a symbol of Lismore's flood recovery, with many hung from flood-affected homes and businesses around the city. ""We're just doing that as a thank you for all the artists for coming to support our community,"" banner coordinator, Rebecca Ryan, said. Daryl Braithwaite said he signed on to play as a way to show his support to those who had lost so much. ""When the call went out, with all my peers and stuff, you sort of put your hand up and go, 'OK, yeah, can I play?'"" he said. ""And it's just because you like to help any way you can.""

102,Morrison uses campaign launch to announce policy to allow first home buyers to use super to purchase property,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Prime Minister has used the Liberal Party's campaign launch to announce a plan to allow first home buyers to use their superannuation to purchase a property. The Liberal Party chose Brisbane to officially launch their campaign, only six days out from election day. Resource-rich Queensland was key to the Coalition's ""miracle"" win at the 2019 election, with Scott Morrison echoing his election-night line at Sunday's event, opening with: ""How good is it to be in Queensland."" Mr Morrison went on to announce the Super Home Buyer scheme, which — if the Coalition is re-elected on Saturday — would enable first home buyers to use up to 40 per cent of their super, up to $50,000, to put towards buying a home. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. The Coalition says this would slash the time needed to save a house deposit by three years on average. ""A re-elected Coalition government will allow first home buyers to invest a responsible portion of their own superannuation savings into their first home,"" Mr Morrison said. ""This would apply to both new and existing homes and whatever amount is invested will be returned to your super when you sell the home, including the share of the capital gain from the sale of that home. ""Superannuation is there to help Australians in their retirement — the evidence shows that ""The best thing we can do to help Australians achieve financial security in their retirement is to help them own their own home."" If the Coalition is re-elected, the scheme would begin on July 1, 2023, for first home buyers who must have saved another five per cent of their deposit separately. The buyer must also live in the home for at least 12 months, but there are no age, property or income thresholds. Shadow Housing Minister Jason Clare described the policy as the ""last desperate act of a dying government"" and that people struggling the most to enter the housing market would not be helped because they typically had the lowest superannuation savings. He also said it would ""add fuel to the fire"" of house prices, and drive them up. Mr Clare pointed to other senior Liberal Party figures including former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, former finance minister Mathias Cormann and Peter Costello who have been vocally against the idea. ""I think the Australian people can see through this… and know that if this was a good idea the [government] would've done it years ago, not six days before the election,"" he said. Mr Morrison also used his speech to run through the last three years of his prime ministership, selling his record of economic management through the pandemic. ""On almost every measure, growth, jobs, debt levels, fatality rates, vaccine rates, Australia's recovery is leading the advanced world,"" he said. ""When [Treasurer] Josh [Frydenberg] and I stood together, before the Australian people in the early stages of the pandemic back in March 2020… [the] nation was gripped by fear and uncertainty. ""And so JobKeeper was born, and the many other measures that followed, constantly supporting Australians to find their way forward. ""This was a time for strength, it was a time for pushing through. I had one focus, as your Prime Minister — save the country."" Mr Morrison then pitched for a next term where government intervention would pull back. ""Australians, they are tired of politics. It's been an exhausting time, and they've certainly had enough of governments telling them how to live their lives, and I agree,"" he said. ""We've been building a bridge to the other side economically in a time of global uncertainty and here we are. ""We now stand on a different edge to the one that I spoke of before. One where fear doesn't dominate, but aspiration."" Mr Morrison also announced an election promise to invest $454 million to fast track the Loyal Wingman project for the Air Force. ""This is a next generation stealth, unmanned, aerial vehicle leveraging artificial intelligence to support manned aircraft to conduct air combat, reconnaissance and surveillance missions,"" he said. ""The first military combat aircraft to be designed, engineered and manufactured in Australia in 50 years."" Guests at the launch included former prime ministers Tony Abbott and John Howard, alongside his wife Janette. Mr Howard has been campaigning for the Coalition throughout the campaign, while Mr Abbott has been a less prominent presence, although not completely absent. Mr Morrison's immediate predecessor Malcolm Turnbull was not present at the launch. Labor Leader Anthony Albanese was also in Brisbane on Sunday, attending a rally alongside Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.

103,Ukraine takes out Eurovision top spot in landslide win ,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Ukraine has won the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest by a landslide, with Kalush Orchestra finishing 193 points ahead of its competition for its folk-hip-hop performance of Stefania. The group claimed a total of 631 points after it was awarded a whopping 439 points from audience televotes, adding to the 192 points from the jury of 40 countries around Europe and Australia. Kalush Orchestra's performance of Stefania, which was written about frontman Oleh Psiuk's mother, struck a chord with viewers, with the song becoming an anthem for war-torn Ukraine with lyrics like, ""I'll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed"". ""Thank you so much, thank you for supporting Ukraine. This  [is a] victory for every Ukrainian. Slava Ukraini,"" lead singer Oleh Psiuk said. In second place was the United Kingdom's Sam Ryder who earned 466 points for his performance of Space Man followed by Spain's Chanel who stunned the audience with her vocals and dancing skills during her performance of SloMo.

104,Latest hit to country shows has them fearing for the future of ride operators,business,"  Country shows fear what the future may hold if insurance hikes force out ride operators Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The loudspeaker squawked that the dodgem cars ride was over, and the music stopped. Show ride operators have held a show-stopping strike to protest rising insurance costs Insurance premiums have increased by 300 per cent over 12 months, with just one international supplier available The Showmen's Guild of Australasia said the federal government promised a $5 million loan that never came Justin Gill, a fifth-generation show ride operator, or showman, stepped out of the booth and away from the ride. The day was not done, but Mr Gill and all the other show ride operators at the Charleville show in south-west Queensland were standing in protest and solidarity over a rapid increase in insurance costs. ""It's just hard, a kick in the guts,"" Mr Gill said. ""As insurance goes up, the showmen are going to go down. ""We're trying to get a bit of help from the government, a bit of support."" For ride operator Michael Brown, even managing to pay the costs of insurance was not enough to get his Ferris wheel set up this year in western Queensland. ""My Ferris wheel normally works over there but I can't get the men to set it up,"" Mr Brown said. The insurance hikes are just the latest hit in a line of blows for the people who work the country show circuit. Shows being cancelled due to COVID-19, then fuel hikes, vaccine mandates and staff shortages have all taken their toll on show ride operators, some of whom had already decided against travelling the circuit this year. Those who have made it are concerned they will have to start passing on the additional costs to their customers. But Mr Brown hoped with government support, sideshow rides would not die out completely. ""If we [don't come] what are the local kids going to do in these little country towns?"" he said. ""They'll have no entertainment [at ag shows]."" Showmen's Guild of Australasia [SGA] president Aaron Pink said insurance costs had risen by more than 300 per cent over the past 12 months. ""At the moment, there's only one supplier of public liability insurance who is willing to insure rides and the amusement industry, which is an overseas company,"" he said. ""The premiums have spiked as there is now only one supplier in the market, and they have a monopoly."" Together with the Australian Amusement, Leisure and Recreation Association (AALARA), the SGO have been hoping to build a mutual discretionary fund that would provide self-insurance to operators. The AALARA spoke to the federal government about a $5 million loan to start the fund, but the money was nowhere to be found in the last budget. ""If there's a new pool getting built in town, it gets help,"" Mr Gill said. ""To fix showgrounds, they get government grants, [so] why can't the Showmen's Guild?"" The SGA said it was now back to square one after what it  thought was a successful negotiation with the government. ""It's a huge industry employing more than 7,000 people and contributing $1.4 billion to the economy annually, which will be killed off if these insurance rises aren't addressed and some support offered,"" Mr Pink said. ""We have ticked every box and jumped through every hoop the Liberal government have asked of us to gain support. ""We were advised the support would come if we followed the process, and yet it wasn't included in the recent budget. ""And last week, we received an official rejection."" A spokesperson for Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar said the government was ""considering the recommendations of the Small Business Ombudsman on the most appropriate mechanism to support the industry"". Cairns Show Association president Ian Allen said if rides stopped coming, it would be detrimental to the city as well as smaller, surrounding communities. Nearly 70,000 people made it through the gates at the Cairns show last year, which boasts having the same number of rides as Brisbane's Ekka. ""The Cairns community love coming to the show because of the rides,"" Mr Allen said. ""The showmen wouldn't come up this far if Cairns wasn't so successful [and if showmen couldn't come] it would have a knock-on effect onto the Mossman, Malanda, Tully, Atherton and the Charters Towers shows."" For Mr Gill, who has been travelling to Charleville in outback Queensland for shows for 48 years, said the love people had for the shows was made all the more evident after COVID-19 cancellations. ""We come back, and people are lining up at the gates,"" he said. ""They can't wait to get a dagwood dog, or go on the dodgem cars, they can't wait. ""But the government won't help to keep [shows] going."" ABC Western Qld will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

105,Short-stay properties and sea changers have left Adriana's hometown with a 'non-existent' rental market ,business,"  After 10 years of Airbnb and short-stay rentals, is Australia ready for regulation? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For six months after breaking up with her partner, aged care worker Adriana Breen searched for a rental home on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. ""The rental market was just non-existent,"" she said. ""The rents were unaffordable as well. You're looking at $400-plus where they used to be $280."" Ms Breen still works on the peninsula, but she no longer lives there. Instead, she has to drive the 80-kilometre round trip from Frankston, in Melbourne's south-east, every day. ""Mentally it affects me because this was my happy place — I love the peninsula,"" she said. ""I know it's only half an hour down the road, but it could be on the other side of the Earth as far as I'm concerned because I'm not near my family."" Ten years ago the Mornington Peninsula had a ""healthy"" rental vacancy rate of 3 per cent, but it's now at 0.7 per cent. Experts — using figures from independent advocacy and data group InsideAirbnb — say for every vacant rental, there are about 30 short-stay rentals available on Airbnb. ""Non-metropolitan Australia has … always had tight rental markets,"" urban planner and policy analyst Nicole Gurran said. ""Even a small increase — and we've seen a significant increase — in demand for housing associated with the short-term tourism market is going to exacerbate those tight rental vacancy rates."" But coastal communities are facing more than an increase in short-term accommodation. During the pandemic, people have fled the cities and moved to regional areas. ""With the increase in demand from people moving to coastal locations … combined with the increase in tourism demand, that's created a perfect storm in which rental vacancy rates are pitifully low,"" Professor Gurran said. There are about 100,000 Airbnbs properties across Australia, according to figures from data group AirDNA. About 85 per cent of those are entire homes. And while short-term stays have always been popular in coastal areas and tourism hotspots, when it launched in Australia 10 years ago, Airbnb brought holiday homes to capital cities. ""In Australia we haven't had a tradition of having holiday homes in our major cities,"" Professor Gurran said. ""So when we see the cluster of short-term rentals around [our big cities] it's safe to assume that those are residential homes and apartments that have been withdrawn from the permanent rental market."" The sharing platform says it has boosted local economies by attracting tourists and creating jobs. An Oxford Economics report found Airbnb contributed more than $10 billion to Australia's economy in 2019. But a 2019 report by America's Economic Policy Institute found that Airbnb's economic benefits were outweighed by the cost to renters. Then in 2020, global tourism ground to a halt. ""COVID really showed there's a connection between the short-term rental market and rents all across Australia, and indeed across the world,"" housing researcher Peter Phibbs said. In the Tasmanian capital of Hobart, residents have been in the midst of a housing crisis that predates COVID-19. Professor Phibbs said the number of Airbnbs in the city equated to about 9 per cent of the total rental market. That is much higher than in any other capital city in Australia. And Hobart's rental vacancy rate is just 0.3 per cent — the lowest for any capital city. During the pandemic, the balance has shifted. ""When housing stock went from short-term rental back to the long-term rental market, in places like Hobart we saw a sharp reduction in rents,"" he said. Professor Phibbs estimated that during COVID, rents in Hobart dropped by about 9 per cent. Another study in Sydney by William Thackway and Christopher Pettit found rent prices in the most active Airbnb neighbourhoods dropped by up to 7 per cent. While not all of this can be attributed to Airbnb, Professor Phibbs said the evidence was clear: You cannot have an unregulated short-term accommodation industry and a healthy long-term rental market. ""Those two things just can't co-exist,"" he said. ""We need some sort of regulation to limit the spread of short-term rentals so we can enable the long-term rental market to provide homes for so many households that are looking for them at the moment."" Across the world, major tourist destinations are moving to regulate short-stay rentals. In Amsterdam, an entire home can only be rented out for a maximum of 30 nights per year. While in New York, it is generally illegal to rent out an entire unit for less than 30 days. Although there are exceptions. Meanwhile, Berlin allows you to lease out your primary residence, but it can be a bit harder to put a second home on the short-term market and you can only let a secondary residence out for a maximum of 90 days. ""Making the regulation is probably the easy part,"" Professor Phibbs said. ""Enforcing the regulation can be quite difficult. It's certainly resource-intensive. It sometimes involves quite long legal processes. ""It's important to have some kind of taxing regime where short-term rentals pay for the cost of that regulation through some sort of bed tax."" In Australia, New South Wales has 180-day caps in some areas, while Western Australia has been investigating a 60-day cap. Meanwhile, Hobart is hoping to become the first capital city to place a cap on the number of short stays. If successful, it will stop any more entire homes from becoming short-stay accommodation. But it could take a while to change the planning scheme, and in the meantime it could prompt a rush on converting homes to short stays. Professor Phibbs said it was a blunt option, but the only one available to the council. Sushannah's young family had a rental with a big backyard and a dog. Now, they're homeless and living in a tent. ""A partnership between local councils and the state government, where local councils could make decisions based on their particular housing markets but there was an overall state government framework that allowed them to do that, would be ideal,"" he said. In a statement, Airbnb country manager for Australia and New Zealand Susan Wheeldon described the proposed changes in Hobart as ill-considered and said they would place the city and Tasmania on unequal footing with the rest of the nation. ""Housing affordability and availability is a complex issue with a range of contributing factors,"" she said. ""In markets that are traditionally popular with holiday-makers and have always comprised holiday homes, vacancy rates have faced significant pressure due to the relocation of many Australians from cities to regional areas throughout the pandemic. ""In many cases, hosts make properties available on our platform that would otherwise be used only as holiday homes."" Louise Elliot owns a short-stay property in Hobart, and is the president of the Tasmanian Residential Rental Property Owners Association. Ms Elliot, who is running for a seat on the Hobart City Council in 2022, said blaming short-stay properties for the rental crisis was ""very short-sighted"". ""It's a really complex issue. Short stay is a small component of that issue … but it's not the biggest factor,"" she said. ""We need far more social and public housing and we need the processes for building new homes to be more straightforward."" Ms Elliot also rejected the idea that all of the entire homes [listed as short stay] would have otherwise been rentals. ""All you have to be to be a whole home is to have your own kitchenette, toilet or entrance,"" she said. ""A lot of those homes, they’re either under people’s houses, on people's properties or they're places that they'd otherwise leave unoccupied."" She said it made sense for some kind of regulation to be considered, but she said it needed to take into account the benefits of the industry. ""Density limits or prohibiting businesses from owning short-stay properties makes sense, but I think it needs to be a much more rounded discussion,"" she said. ""I don't think blanket bans make sense because there can be unintended consequences. ""We need to recognise the benefits of tourism and how important that is to our communities.""

106,Coalition offers incentives for older Australians to downsize,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Pensioners, self-funded retirees and working older Australians are being offered new financial incentives to sell their family home earlier and downsize to something smaller. The Prime Minister will use today's Liberal campaign launch in Brisbane to unveil the new policy, aimed at freeing up larger homes in the property market for younger families. The policy has two key planks — the first is an extension of an existing tax break allowing up to $300,000 from the sale of a family home to be placed into superannuation without a penalty. The second is another tweak encouraging pensioners to sell by exempting the proceeds of the sale from the assets test for two years instead of one. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was aimed at clearing hurdles for older Australians to sell their home and put more larger properties on the market for those looking to get in. ""We are now giving Australians more choice to decide how they want to live the next stage of their life by removing financial barriers for people wanting to downsize their home,"" Mr Morrison said. ""By removing barriers for Australians downsizing to residences that better suit their needs and lifestyle, we are helping to free up larger homes for younger families"". Federal Labor has promised to match the policy, with Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese describing it as a ""modest"" policy. ""This suggestion by the government is a practical one,"" Mr Albanese said. ""We will support it, but we will have much more in our offer to the Australian people next Saturday."" Labor used its campaign launch two weeks ago to launch a housing policy, outlining a shared-equity scheme aimed at helping people to buy into the market. Under the current rules, anyone aged over 65 can sell their home of 10 years or more and place $300,000 of the proceeds into their superannuation. The $300,000 is outside of contribution caps, and so attracts significant tax breaks. Couples can double the benefit, and contribute $300,000 each to their superannuation. The age limit was already due to be lowered to 60 from July 1, but the Coalition has promised to instead lower it to 55 if re-elected. The policy was first introduced in the 2017-18 budget, but has had a relatively low take-up rate since then. Some housing policy experts have pointed to evidence suggesting many older Australians are emotionally attached to their properties and are unlikely to be motivated by financial incentives. Minister for Housing Michael Sukkar said lowering the age threshold would lead to more homes being put on the market. ""We know it's freeing up more housing stock, those larger family homes for others to be able to purchase,"" he said. ""Bringing the age down to 55, a million extra Australians will be eligible."" Pensioners looking to sell their home face significant penalties for doing so, as while the family home is exempt from the assets test, proceeds from a sale are included. It means pensioners are effectively discouraged from selling their home and buying or renting a smaller, cheaper property. Currently, pensioners are given a year's grace period after selling to buy a new home or arrange their assets, during which the cash made from the sale is exempt from the assets test. The new policy would double that period to two years from January 1, 2023. The government expects the policy will have a relatively low cost to the budget, estimating a cost of $62 million over four years. Nearly 2 million pensioners currently own their own home. Federal Labor has also detailed a new policy, announcing it will establish a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing projects if it is elected. The money would come from Labor's already-announced National Reconstruction Fund. The fund would offer loans, guarantees or equity to businesses looking to expand their advanced manufacturing operations, operating in a manner similar to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. An independent board would make investment decisions, but Labor said it would prioritise supporting innovation and creating new jobs. Labor has previously indicated it would honour contracts already signed under the government's similar $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative.

107,What Labor and Liberal Facebook ad spend tells us about where the election campaign is heading,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog We're rounding the final bend, but the election campaign marathon is now becoming a sprint to the finish, with political parties of all stripes upping their campaign pace and ad spend. Analysis of social media spending data and the movements of major party leaders suggests neither party vying for government wants to leave anything on the table in their bid to form government in less than a week. And the data suggests that if you're sick of the campaign already, you might want to switch off social media for the next week, because the advertising is only ramping up. Data from Facebook's ad library report shows that in the week ending Tuesday, more than $3 million was spent by advertisers in Australia on election, political and social issues. That's up from about $2 million the week prior. The figures include not-for-profit groups and other campaigners running ads on issues not explicitly linked to the federal election. Spending is up everywhere, but when you account for the populations of each state and territory, we see that Tasmanians are getting far more attention than any other Australians. That reflects the fact that a sizeable chunk of the island state's population lives in a crucial marginal seat, and the narrowing attention on key seats as targets for ads advertising. The spend may well exceed the levels seen during the Tasmanian state election campaign last year, before the campaign winds up. While everyone is upping the ante, one party has escalated quicker than the others. The ABC has categorised each Facebook advertiser that has spent more than $100 in a single day on the platform at any point this year, according to whether they are political in nature, and which party or group they belong to. Doing this gives a more comprehensive look at spending patterns across the parties than by looking at any individual candidate or party account. The analysis shows that while the major parties had been in relative lock step through to mid-way through the campaign, Labor has since rapidly increased its spend on the platform. Most of Labor's spend has been on the national party account, which has also dialed up its negative messaging since the first day of the campaign. The ABC has looked at the messaging in all ads with at least $200 spent on them on the major party's main account, and classified them as primarily positive, or primarily negative. Precise dollar figures for each ad are not disclosed by Facebook, but the ads represent, counting very conservatively, at least $1.3 million worth of spending. The analysis does not consider any ad on any candidate or state party page. Labor's account started the campaign purely positive, but that quickly shifted. It swung the dial entirely negative in late April with a barrage of attack ads about Scott Morrison, but has since moderated to the point where roughly half of its ads are negative. Meanwhile, every single ad the Liberal Party has spent more than $200 on since April 26 has been negative, attacking either Labor, Anthony Albanese, Labor candidates, or independents. Those are the big ads at least, but both major parties are also running scores of ads with smaller spends, and the messages in those vary. The Liberals launched a series of ads targeted at individual electorates this week. The ads promoting ""Our Plan"" have been running in at least 23 key seats, featuring the party's candidates and MPs. But the plan changes from seat to seat. While everyone's being told the Liberals will deliver ""More Jobs"", ""Lower Taxes"", ""Better Health"" and ""Better Roads"", the fifth plank of the plan varies. In 16 seats, including Corangamite, Pearce, and Braddon, ""Stronger Defence"" is being promised. But in other seats, including those like Kooyong and Goldstein being challenged by teal independents, voters are being told about the plan for a ""Cleaner Environment"". The other seats that the Liberals clearly feel like the environment is a key issue are Flinders, Curtin, Sturt, Chisholm and Boothby. The party is also tailoring its message in other parts of the country, like in Canberra, where the local branch of the Liberal Party is chasing the vote of consultants. ""Do you work as a contractor or consultant to the APS,"" the ad asks. ""Under a Labor-Greens Alliance your job is at serious risk."" It's possibly the only part of the country where they make up a significant enough voting bloc to warrant direct targeting. This week, Labor has again been running ads to older Australians, stoking fears about the cashless debit card. One ad bought by Queensland Labor features a pensioner from Bribie Island, who says ""I won't risk my pension on Scott Morrison"". Bribie Island is located in the key marginal seat of Longman, currently held by the LNP on a 3.3 per cent margin. Victorian Labor is also running ads on the topic, promising to ""scrap the cashless debit card"". While proving the effectiveness of any individual ad is an impossible task, Google Trends data does reveal a modest increase in search traffic for the term ""cashless debit"" in those two states in the most recent week. The same lift has not occurred in other states for which data is available.

108,"Rose doesn’t remember struggling when she raised children. For her daughter-in-law Robyn, it’s a different story",business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Childcare was simple, cheap and a little dangerous when Rose Cantali arrived in Australia in 1961 as a three-year-old Italian immigrant. Instead of before- or after-school care, Rose walked the streets of Sydney, relying on a string with a house key around her neck. They were known as ""latchkey kids"". Instantly identifiable, the key was a signal to the world they were solo with parental permission. Neighbours would help with childcare, freeing up Rose's parents to work hard and make a start in a new country. But by the time she was raising her own four children from the late 1970s to the 1990s, childcare was very different, albeit at a fraction of what it costs parents today. ""You were looking at about I think it was $30 a day at the time, which was very, very manageable,"" she said. ""I don't remember ever struggling."" The ABC joined Rose and three generations of her family as they shared a meal and some precious moments together. And just like at many dinner tables around Australia, discussion about rising costs is never far away. Unlike Rose's stress-free childcare arrangements, her daughter-in-law Robyn Cantali estimates childcare for her one-year-old son Mathew and three-year-old daughter Emilia costs her $40,000 a year. ""It is a great deal of money for us. But [childcare] is something that we really value, that we really see as an investment,"" she said. All the same, the impact on the family budget was so big that it was a line ball call on whether Robyn would return to work after her pregnancies. ""With the increased price of living and other expenses, we really had to think whether it was feasible for me,"" she said. The 38-year-old is now expecting her third child, adding to the bill. Then, in the next few years, there's school to think about. According to Rose, who sent her four children to private schools, the bills families face today are ""mind boggling"". She estimates the cost of education these days is about four times what she paid for her children. While Rose remembers that it was tough at the time to pay for her children's school fees, she knows many families today are starting on the backfoot, after years of high early-learning expenses. Even when accounting for inflation, it is clear childcare is a much bigger drain on the budget for the next generation of the Cantali family. Data from The Futurity Investment Group, a company that issues education bonds and loans, estimates the national average cost to parents for a child's school education over 13 years in the public system is $83,869. For Catholic schools that figure is $143,944 and for independent schools, $349,404. In addition to school fees, the estimates include other expenses such as extracurricular activities and excursions. However, private schools dispute the figures, claiming it is not academic research and pointing to a much lower median fee. ""I would advise parents to do their own research and be wary of companies framing education costs to suit their commercial objectives,"" said Geoff Newcombe from the Association of Independent Schools of NSW. Families have told the ABC that Victorian public schools are charging as much as $11,000 a year in ""extracurricular"" fees. Dr Newcombe said the yearly median fee for independent schools in New South Wales was $5,500. The exact amount parents spend varies across public and independent schools, but data released earlier this year found back to school costs for parents with children in primary and high school will total $20.3 billion this year. Increasingly, parents are moving to the independent sector — according to the ABS it is now at 35 per cent — in human terms that is 1.4 million students. Parents at independent schools are more satisfied with the education their child is receiving than those at public schools, Australia Talks data shows. Comparisons to previous generations based on data are difficult to find but few parents would dispute that it is getting more expensive. In education, the biggest policy differences are found in early learning. The Coalition announced $3.3 billion in pre-school funding and extra rebates for parents with kids in childcare that kicked in earlier this year. Labor is offering bigger rebates to most families earning up to $530,000, kicking in from July 2023 at a cost the party estimates at $5.4 billion. Neither major party has any significant university reforms planned, but the Greens are promising to waive all student debt. It is unlikely to happen. Robyn is not sure where she will send Emilia and Mathew, but she is already saving to pay for it. ""It is not so much about private or public or independent, [it] is really about what is the best thing we can possibly do for our children,"" she said. For Rose and Robyn Cantali, helping young families with the cost is something they would like both sides of politics to focus on. ""We are not seeing any outcomes of all of this. I think the community is not seeing any movement,"" Ms Cantali said.

109,"India bans wheat exports as heatwave curbs output, prices soar",business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog India has banned wheat exports with immediate effect, just days after saying it was targeting record shipments this year, as a scorching heatwave curtailed output and local prices hit an all-time high amid strong export demand. A notice in the government gazette by the Directorate of Foreign Trade said a spike in global prices for wheat, partly due to the war in Ukraine, was threatening the food security of India and neighbouring and vulnerable countries. The government said it would still allow exports for letters of credit that have already been issued and on the request from countries that are trying ""to meet their food security needs"". Prior to the ban, India was targeting to ship out a record 10 million tonnes this year. Global buyers were banking on the world's second-biggest wheat producer for supplies after exports from the Black Sea region plunged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Before the war, Ukraine and Russia accounted for a third of global wheat and barley exports. Ukraine is one of the world's biggest suppliers of wheat, the main ingredient for instant noodles. However, a prolonged war in the country could leave manufacturers short of supply, driving up the price of the pantry staple. Since Russia's February 24 invasion, Ukraine's ports have been blocked and civilian infrastructure and grain silos have been destroyed. The Indian ban could drive up global prices to new peaks and hit poor consumers in Asia and Africa. ""The ban is shocking,"" a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm said. ""We were expecting curbs on exports after two to three months, but [it] seems inflation numbers changed government's mind."" Rising food and energy prices pushed India's annual retail inflation up towards an eight-year high in April, strengthening economists' view that the central bank would have to raise interest rates more aggressively to curb prices. Wheat prices in India have risen to record highs, in some spot markets to as high as 25,000 rupees ($465) per tonne, versus the government fixed minimum support price of 20,150 rupees. Even though it is the world's second-largest producer of wheat, India consumes most of the wheat it produces. It had set a goal of exporting 10 million tons of the grain in 2022-23, looking to capitalise on the global disruptions to wheat supplies from the war and find new markets for its wheat in Europe, Africa and Asia. Much of that would have gone to other developing countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. Apart from problems with weather hurting harvests, India's own vast stocks of wheat — a buffer against famine — have been strained by distribution of free grain during the pandemic to some 800 million people. More than 1 billion people in India and Pakistan are sweltering through a record-breaking heatwave. Is this a taste of things to come? But a sharp and sudden rise in temperatures in mid-March means the crop size could be smaller than expected at around 100 million tonnes or even lower, a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm said, versus a government estimate for an all-time high of 111.32 million tonnes. ""The government's procurement has fallen more than 50 per cent. Spot markets are getting far lower supplies than last year. All these things are indicating lower crop,"" the dealer said. In April, India exported a record 1.4 million tonnes of wheat and deals were already signed to export around 1.5 million tonnes in May. ""Indian ban will lift global wheat prices. Right now there is no big supplier in the market,"" the second dealer said.

110,"Show stopper: Amusement ride operators protest against 'kick in the guts', 300pc insurance-fee hike",business,"  Amusement ride operators stage show-stopping strike as insurance-crisis talks break down Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Amusement rides are one of the biggest drawcards at regional shows, but ride owners say their future is in doubt due to escalating insurance costs. Operators have held a 15-minute ride strike at shows across regional New South Wales and Queensland to highlight the issue. Following a ride stop last weekend at the Hawkesbury Show, Australia's largest regional show, organisers said they hoped to raise awareness of the ""public liability crisis"" the industry is facing. Amusement Services Australia director Amanda McPherson said the rising cost of insurance had brought the industry to a ""standstill"". ""The premiums have soared through the roof, our own business was halted for 18 months because we couldn't obtain cover,"" Ms McPherson said. ""Coincidentally around the same time as the pandemic, all the suppliers of public liability just withdrew from the market, we were hit with a double whammy."" To operate on Crown land, public liability cover is a legal requirement for amusement ride owners to ensure the safety of participants. On the eve of an election, talks with the federal government and peak industry bodies broke down last week. A solution recommended by the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman was dismissed. Australian Amusement, Leisure and Recreation Association (AALARA) president Shane McGrath said it felt like a ""kick in the guts"" for the industry. ""We were advised the support would come if we followed the process, and yet it wasn't included in the recent budget and last week we received an official rejection of our solution,"" he said. A proposed Discretionary Mutual Fund to offer insurance-like protection to operators was dismissed by the federal government. In a statement to Radio National Breakfast earlier this week, a spokesperson for Assistant Treasury Michael Sukkar said the government was ""considering the recommendations of the Small Business Ombudsman on the most appropriate mechanism to support the industry"". ""Our insurance costs have gone up by an astronomical 300 per cent in just 12 months which is totally unmanageable for our members,"" Mr McGrath said. ""The government will effectively kill the fun for everyone if they don't step up."" Showmen's Guild of Australasia delegate David Allan said the 300 per cent increase was not viable for a lot of ride operators. ""We don't want to annoy people, they've paid good money to come in here, it's just 15 minutes to make people aware of our plight,"" he said at the Coffs Harbour Show on Saturday morning, ahead of the ride stop. ""We should be applauded … the ones that are here are paying through the teeth for the insurance."" Coffs Harbour is one of nine regional shows across NSW and Queensland that took part in the walk-off. Show society president Christopher Pearson said many operators had been significantly impacted by the insurance hikes over the past two years. ""The protest isn't going to impact showgoers as much as the fee increases,"" he said. ""There are two rides on the Coffs Harbour showground alone that are just sitting there unable to operate because they can't find the appropriate $20 million insurance."" With a rich 200-year history and more than 500 regional shows across the nation, the rides have become part of Australian culture. ""According to our calculations we inject about $1.3 million into the local economy, but on the back of the pandemic, natural disasters and now insurance woes, country shows may not be around for much longer,"" Mr Pearson said. Other shows that participated in the walk-off were Bingara, Bourke, Orange, Yeoval, Gympie, Ipswich, Charleville and Brookfield shows.

111,Contrasting solutions presented for how to build Australia's new and more flexible electricity system,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog To reduce emissions, incorporate new technology and energy sources, Australia needs a new electricity system. The grid of the future needs to be more stable, less centralised and handle large amounts of renewables. The question this election is how to build it. Brisbane company eleXsys wants to help transform the grid. It is making equipment to handle large amounts of electricity being fed back in by rooftop solar. ""The grid is a one-way grid,"" executive director Richard Romanowski told the ABC. ""It sends energy from the coal power or the solar farm into the city, but when you want to send energy backwards, it has a limit. ""It only lets 15–20 per cent of the energy go backwards. ""We fix that — we allow for 100 per cent energy going backwards — and that then allows us to decarbonise the whole world very fast and cheaply."" The company is assembling products by hand in an old petrol station in Brisbane, but a government grant will help them move to a purpose-built factory soon. ""The federal government grant is a huge leg-up to help us get going – it's phenomenal to get it,"" Mr Romanowski said. The Coalition said the grant was an example of its ""technology, not taxes"" approach to decarbonisation. It has made its own investments in grid infrastructure and is funding new gas and hydro power stations. Labor is promising to transform the grid faster by creating a new body called Rewiring the Nation. It would provide $20 billion of low-cost finance for power companies to build new transmission infrastructure, allowing them to connect more cheap renewables sooner. ""Rewiring the Nation will cover its real costs, not deliver a commercial return to government,"" Labor's Powering Australia policy stated. ""This will lower the cost of the upgrade, helping to ensure consumers get the lowest possible price, by shielding them from the risk of gold-plating in the necessary upgrade of transmission projects."" Labor said its plan aligned with the blueprint of the Australian Energy Market Regulator, but the Coalition said it would increase power prices. Green Energy Markets analyst Tristan Edis said some of Labor's promised spending may be unnecessary. ""Their main policy for building new transmission… some of that money could be better spent,"" he said. ""Labor have a far better framework than the Liberal Party, but there's a lot that's left unsaid in their policy that requires a lot more work."" The Coalition has also committed to new generation projects, including carbon-emitting gas power and the pumped hydro power scheme, Snowy 2.0. ""[The Coalition is] delivering reliable generation to support continued growth in renewables, empowering businesses and communities to make choices on their energy needs, making targeted investments in critical transmission projects where that stacks up for consumers, and implementing key reforms to protect consumers and deliver a fit-for-purpose post-2025 market design,"" a spokesperson for Energy Minister Angus Taylor told the ABC. The government has committed to reaching net zero by 2050, and says it is on track to beat its 2030 emissions targets. But what will it take to turn Australia green? But Mr Edis said the Coalition's policy did not do enough to lower emissions. ""They say they're committed to net zero but they've not put in any policies to require industry to achieve that,"" he said. ""Industry is saying… we need a clearer legal framework."" In contrast, Labor wants to change the rules for Australia's biggest polluters — tightening something introduced by the Coalition called the ""safeguard mechanism"". This key policy element would make polluters pay more for failing to reduce emissions, by gradually reducing the level of penalty-free emissions, or ""baselines"", allowed over time. ""[This is] a really good idea. It's actually supported by even a number of the big polluters and it's just sensible,"" Mr Edis said. Labor is also proposing to fund around 400 new community batteries for households that cannot afford their own. It is also proposing building 85 shared solar arrays — at a total cost of $100 million — to help people access renewable energy. Energy consultant Rachel Brdanovic, who works on community energy projects, told the ABC they were sensible ideas. ""They're kind of crunch points for the community in terms of people who want to put solar on will, people who can afford batteries will, but to get those things happening at a community level definitely needs government input,"" she said. But they did not go as far as Labor's 2019 policy of funding household batteries, to reach a target of 1 million across Australia. ""It's sort of a token distraction. The scale involved is too small to make a meaningful difference,"" Mr Edis said of the new policy. Where it all matters to voters is in terms of power prices. The Coalition says it has already brought them down. But the wholesale price of energy is going up because the price of gas is increasing and coal power plants have cut their output. The Australian Energy Market Regulator says renewables will lower energy prices in the next few years, as long as the upgrade of the grid is managed well.

112,World famous Australian contemporary composer collaborates with Alice chamber orchestra,business,"  Elena Kats-Chernin, Australia's world famous contemporary composer, working with Alice Springs orchestra Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Central Australia boasts spectacular sunrises and sunsets, dark enough skies to see the edge of the milky way and the harsh searing heat of the midday sun. All these elements are the inspiration for a brand new piece of work by one of Australia's most prolific and well-known composers and pianists, Elena Kats-Chernin, who boasts a catalogue of 300 pieces. The Red Centre Suite is in four movements and has been written specifically for the Alice Springs World Chamber Orchestra, thanks to a chance meeting three years ago. The meeting was with Markus Kuchenbuch, the Alice Springs World Chamber Orchestra's artistic director, at a music festival in NSW. It is thanks to his tenacity that Kats-Chernin has not only composed a piece about the region, but has also come to Alice Springs to work directly with the orchestra. ""You never really think it's going to happen because not everyone follows through,"" Kats-Chernin said. ""However, Markus is the kind of person who follows through."" The four movements are Night Stars, Dawn, Noon, and Sunset, and was written without ever seeing the landscape. ""I have very rarely written about a place,"" she said. ""It's always extremely special to actually be in the place I have written about, especially if I wrote [the piece] before I actually came here, which is kind of unusual."" Kats-Chernin said that after many decades of composing it was hard to pinpoint the moment the material crystallises. ""It's always a mystery how a piece gets born,"" she said. ""I have perfected a skill, which is to move myself into a zone, mentally, into a particular place. ""I can place myself internally anywhere — be it emotion, flavour, a state of being, or a place I can imagine myself there."" Kats-Chernin said she was impressed with the calibre of Alice Springs' musicians ""and the quality of their preparation"". ""In the first rehearsal of the piece [it] actually sounded really good already. II was just overjoyed how much the base of the piece was already there,"" she said. ""Once the piece is written it's in the hands of musicians who perform it."" Kats-Chernin said it was a joy to work directly with the musicians. ""To have this direct communication with musicians in the room [so that] we can shape it and mould it, so that it sounds better, so that it makes more sense,"" she said. ""I can [then] tell what's more important in the texture of things. So I can say 'this instrument a bit louder, maybe softer, maybe bring out a certain warmth of the instrument, maybe play it colder'. So it just depends."" ABC Classic invites you to get to know a little bit more about Australian composer Elena Kats-Chernin. Kuchenbuch said that the feedback from the orchestra was very positive, given they had been playing Kats-Chernin's pieces for several years. ""They feel like they have touched fame to have someone of Kats-Chernin's calibre not only write them a piece but to work with them, given that she is booked out until 2024,"" he said. ""For her to have so much time to rehearse with us is very special.""

114,The first challenge facing Albanese is to restore Australia's economy,business,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For all the Coalition's boasts about superior economic management, Anthony Albanese's primary task will be to navigate his new government through the minefield bequeathed to him by his predecessors. Mounting deficits, a mountain of debt, an overstimulated economy and ill-disciplined spending are all operating in a macro-economic environment that no longer reacts or behaves the way the textbooks say it should. That will be no easy task. After almost a decade in government without ever once producing a budget surplus — despite promises to the contrary — the Coalition managed to double the nation's debt even before the pandemic hit. Its legacy? At least another decade of deficits and a trillion-dollar national debt. Ideology often trumped economics as the Coalition repeatedly shut off sources of revenue and added billions of dollars of unnecessary expenditure. It canned the mining tax after politicising it as an evil. In the process, it denied generations of Australians their rightful inheritance and — instead of investing in health, education and aged care — transferred the proceeds to foreign investors. Then there was the carbon tax. It dumped the Gillard government's revenue-neutral carbon price and replaced it with a massive and inefficient subsidy, handing out billions of dollars to polluters in a scheme that now has been transformed into… a carbon price. And while it could rightly claim credit for shielding much of the country from the ravages of the worst recession in a century, it did so via a $90 billion scheme, Jobkeeper, that hosed extraordinary amounts of cash onto a large number of recipients who simply didn't need it. Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues That cash — along with an additional $240 billion COVID spending — has helped ignite an inflationary tinderbox. And, as a parting gift, the stage-three tax cuts — now endorsed by the incoming Albanese government — will strip $37 billion a year from revenue by early next decade, line the pockets of middle and high-income earners and turbo-charge inflation. More on that later. It is difficult enough to try to fix the mistakes of others. In some cases, such as the mining tax, it just isn't worth the political mileage to revisit old battlegrounds. But what do you do when all the old rules no longer apply? Two cornerstones of economic theory appear to have come adrift in recent times that will make life ever tougher for the new government. Both revolve around inflation: one the relationship between wages and inflation and the other, economic growth and inflation. For 30 years, consumer prices for everyday goods have been in check. Suddenly, they're surging out of control and most of the current crop of politicians and monetary chiefs are in unfamiliar territory. For years, the Reserve Bank was being castigated for not generating enough inflation. Suddenly, now, there's way too much. Wages, however, have remained stubbornly subdued, squeezing spending power in what essentially is a real pay-cut. Boosting workers' wages by 5 per cent – for all workers, not just those on the minimum wage — would lead to an increase in prices across the economy of about 2 per cent, according to a new report. It became one of the defining issues of the election: pressures around the cost of living. The burning question was whether the minimum wage should be raised to the same extent as the cost of consumer items. As the election entered its final week, two days of data drops from the Bureau of Statistics were supposed to resolve the battle. Everyone expected to see a lift-off in wages. The RBA had even taken the unusual step of raising interest rates during the election campaign in anticipation. Except, it didn't happen. When the data emerged, we saw the lowest unemployment in 48 years at just 3.9 per cent. With inflation powering ahead at 5.1 per cent, wages should have shown at least some early signs of momentum. Instead, the gulf between consumer prices and earnings widened as wages grew by just 2.4 per cent. It was a devastating blow for Scott Morrison, but now becomes an enormous challenge for Anthony Albanese. It was also an unnerving week for economists. According to what's known as the Phillips Curve, wages are supposed to rise when unemployment drops. Part of the accepted economic wisdom, it was a theory formulated by a Kiwi, A. William Phillips — who worked as a crocodile hunter in Australia before a groundbreaking stint at the London School of Economics in the 1950s. His theory makes perfect sense. When there's a shortage of workers due to low unemployment, business owners are forced to offer more money to attract employees. In tough times, when a lot of people are out of work, wages stagnate. But for much of the past decade, wages have been decoupling from employment. Somewhere around 2011, just after the Global Financial Crisis, the relationship began to break down in Australia. As the economy recovered, the Reserve Bank predicted wages growth would return. The graph below charts the RBA predictions each year against what actually happened. Instead of growing in 2011, wages growth slumped. So, the next year, the RBA figured it merely had been delayed and made a similar prediction for 2012. It didn't happen again. Increasingly desperate and exasperated, the RBA boffins repeated the projections each and every year for the next six years. Full marks for perseverance. There's no clear answer to why wages are stuck in neutral. The RBA postulated that employers were offering other incentives, such as one-off bonuses, extra days off and other benefits. Anything except permanent pay rises. Perhaps the reason it can do this is that the jobs market is not an entirely free market. It is governed by tight laws, particularly around industrial action. Our industrial relations system has been designed specifically to keep wages under control. Australian workers saw their base wages rise 2.4 per cent over the past year, but high inflation meant they took a large real pay cut. From industrial chaos in the 1970s, strike action and industrial disputes have fallen to negligible levels. Private sector wages have been restrained by Enterprise Bargaining Agreements while state governments have kept pay rises in check. Unwinding those arrangements would be nigh on impossible, meaning sustained wage rises in Australia are highly unlikely any time soon. After a year of making himself and the opposition a small target, however, the incoming prime minister took the unusual step of attaching a number to the upcoming tribunal deliberations on the minimum wage. Less than a fortnight out from the election, Mr Albanese nailed his colours to the mast, saying he ""absolutely"" supported a 5.1 per cent pay rise for the 2 per cent of workers on the minimum wage. Mr Morrison was quick to respond, backed up by many in the business community. Such an increase, he said, was ""like throwing fuel on the fire of rising interest rates and rising costs of living"". There's no doubt wage rises fuel inflation. But, if limited to those earning the bare minimum, they would be negligible. Wage rises deliver more spending power, adding to inflation. But so too, do tax cuts. And when it comes to inflationary pressure, the mammoth restructuring of our income tax system in 2024 will deliver it in spades. The Parliamentary Budget Office delivered its verdict a fortnight ago on the stage-three cuts, pushing up the overall cost by a further $22 billion. All up, the tax cuts will inject $206 billion into middle and upper-income earners' pockets in just its first eight years of operation. If consumer prices are still rising at this pace, that's going to force interest rates much higher. Fuel on the inflationary fire? Or scorched earth?

115,"Now is not the time to 'fly too close to the Sun', professional investor warns",business,"  Most Australians have money in the financial markets but now might be a particularly risky time to invest Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The vast majority of Australians have money invested in the financial markets, whether we regularly think about it or not. Working-age Australians with super, younger investors new to the market and trading on apps, or those who won't ever own property — millions of Australians are actively engaged in investing. Indeed, of those who began investing in the past 12 months, 45 per cent were women, according to the Australian Shareholders Association (ASA). It's also been one heck of a ride for investors over the past 24 months as the stock market has crashed, recovered and then bumped along. ""Now is not the time to fly too close to the sun,"" says professional investor Danielle Ecuyer. In other words, she says, it's a particularly risky time to invest. What's different about saving and investing today is that there's literally nowhere to ""hide"" without seriously compromising your return on investment. Let me explain. Policy makers and financial institutions responded to the global financial crisis by pumping trillions of dollars into markets in part to encourage the flow of credit. Interest rates dived to record lows and stayed there for years. Share markets became dependent on cheap money and a once-in-a-generation bull market took hold. For a brief while, interest rates were at record lows, with the potential of staying low for years, and governments pumped tens and hundreds of billions of dollars into their economies to keep them afloat. Globally, markets are considering rate hikes, inflation, war and supply chain woes. Younger investors with extra cash, and those able to draw down on their superannuation accounts, invested in the share market. After months of rolling COVID lockdowns, by the end of 2020 46 per cent of Australians (9 million) held investments outside their home and superannuation accounts, according to the ASA. But fast forward to early 2022 and a war in Ukraine (and its effect on petrol prices), ongoing rising business costs, and shoppers with cabin fever spending hand over fist at the stores... and you have rising inflation. Crucially, this elevated inflation has, technically speaking, no end point. Of course it will reach a climax eventually, but we don't know when that will be, and it may require much higher interest rates to tame it. This uncertainty is created enormous volatility in financial markets. Can you see what I'm getting at? They call it the ""macro"" economy. It's the inter-relationship between household spending, the government, businesses and how inflation and interest rates respond. The ""macro"" environment has become particularly odd. We have rising inflation, diving consumer confidence, rising interest rates and wobbly financial markets — an ugly combination of forces. AMP's chief economist Shane Oliver has a handle on a cross section of assets and their outlook right now, and it's not pretty. ""Shares are likely to see continued short term volatility as central banks continue to tighten to combat high inflation, the war in Ukraine continues and Chinese COVID lockdowns impact,"" Dr Oliver says. ""Still low yields and a capital loss from a further rise in yields are likely to result in ongoing negative returns from bonds. ""Unlisted commercial property may see some weakness in retail and office returns as online retail activity remains well above pre-COVID levels and office occupancy remains well below pre-COVID levels."" And, Dr Oliver adds: ""Australian home price gains are likely to slow further with average prices falling from mid-year as poor affordability, rising mortgage rates and rising listings impact. ""Cash and bank deposits are likely to provide poor returns, given the ultra-low cash rate of just 0.1 per cent at present but it should rise as the RBA raises interest rates,"" he says. In decades past, when the share market became too risky or scary, savers could always retreat to the good ol' trusted bank account and earn a few percentage points return on their investment. Are you better off leaving your money in your super fund or pulling it out for a home deposit? Now, most standard deposit accounts from the big four banks will return less than a percentage point. Some of the major banks have been marketing their term deposits as an alternative but many Australians don't want to lock up large amounts of cash for an extended period right now. It's a highly unusual time. Interest rates are rising fast enough to seriously spook markets offering relatively high returns, but they're not high enough to lift bank deposit returns to anything like normal levels. The sting in the tail here is that we just don't know how elevated inflation will become. So, for now, financial markets volatility is likely to continue. Both major parties are offering to make home ownership easier for various groups of Australians, however many economists are concerned the policies will only add to demand for housing, and push up prices. And even if the Reserve Bank increases the cash rate target aggressively in coming months, deposit account rates are unlikely to rise above one percentage point. It's not just geopolitical unrest and the pandemic that are creating unease for households across the country. There's also nowhere to hide for millions of Australians connected, in some way, to financial markets: people who want their savings to grow... and to sleep comfortably at night.
