0,Some of us are more vulnerable to mould allergies than others. Here's what symptoms to look out for,science," Health What are the health effects of mould, and how do you get rid of it? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog After months of heavy rainfall and increased humidity along Australia's east coast, many people are now dealing with an unwelcome and often stubborn house guest: mould. A type of fungus, mould is present almost everywhere. It lives on plant and animal matter and plays an important role in our ecosystem. But mould growth inside the home, often brought on by flood damage, plumbing leaks or damp and humid conditions, can be damaging to our health, especially when left unchecked. ""There's always mould in every house, but it needs dampness to grow, and there's a lot [of dampness] at the moment because of the floods and rain,"" said Holly Jones, a researcher in the healthy housing unit at Melbourne University's school of population and global health. ""What causes illness is certain species of mould being more concentrated … so by keeping your house dry, you're keeping that in check."" Mould can affect everything from clothing to furniture, and is often noticeable as a stain, smudge or discoloured patch. But it can also be harder to find — behind furniture, at the back of wardrobes, and even inside wall cavities, says architectural scientist Tim Law of Victoria University. ""The problem is mould is not always visible: it tends to grow in the dark, interstitial spaces of a building, so you may not be able to see it,"" said Dr Law, who researches how the microbiology of buildings can affect human health. ""You might be able to smell it, but otherwise, it's usually quite hard to detect."" In order to reproduce, mould spawns tiny particles called spores which are carried in the air. Sometimes, these can trigger allergy and respiratory symptoms such as nasal congestion, wheezing, watery or itchy eyes, coughing, and respiratory infections. Mould can also worsen asthma and allergic conditions. ""All of our organs and surfaces have barriers, and mould is something that can irritate those barriers and open up that junction,"" immunologist and allergy specialist Sheryl Van Nunen said. ""Mould can give you asthma, it can exacerbate your asthma, and it can keep your asthma going or have it become chronic."" For most people, exposure to a very small amount of mould does not have serious health consequences. But how you respond depends on your genetic makeup, underlying health, and how sensitive you are to mould. After months of wet weather, many people are struggling to contain mould. Here's how to get rid of it. Professor Van Nunen, who is also a spokesperson for the National Asthma Council, says approximately 40 per cent of Australians are atopic, meaning they have ""an inherent ability to be allergic"". People with allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions are more vulnerable to the health effects of mould, as are infants, children and older people. ""The thing that concerns me particularly is children … asthma has been clearly established as being associated with visible mould and mould odour,"" Professor Van Nunen said. ""One of the other really important findings is that if a pregnant woman is living in a mouldy home, [her] child has an increased risk of asthma."" People with weakened immune systems — such as cancer patients undergoing treatment or organ transplant recipients — are also at risk of more serious complications, including rare but severe mould infections in the lungs. Dr Law stressed that in large quantities, mould spores can cause ill health in almost anyone. ""At some point, you can have enough mould in the building so that nobody is going to remain healthy under those conditions,"" he said. In addition to established respiratory symptoms, mould exposure has also been linked to a biotoxin-related illness known as Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, or CIRS. CIRS is a progressive multi-system illness characterised by exposure to biotoxins, Dr Law said. Symptoms are reported to include headaches, chronic fatigue, mood swings, allergies and night sweats. ""For a lot of people who have suffered this condition, it took them a long time to make the connection between their condition and the building [they inhabited],"" Dr Law said. ""One of the clearest indicators is if people go on holiday and live in a different environment and then suddenly feel very refreshed, and when they come back to their house or office, they feel it all over again."" But CIRS is not a widely recognised medical condition, and many doctors treat it with ""a certain amount of suspicion"", Dr Law says. What rights do renters have when it comes to mould growth and who should remove it? A 2018 parliamentary inquiry into CIRS called for more research into the potential health effects of mould, after medical experts noted a lack of evidence showing a causal relationship between ""exposure to biotoxins and unexplained complex symptoms"". Ms Jones said one of the key barriers to understanding CIRS was the difficulty researchers faced when trying to measure mould exposure. ""It's not like doing a blood test — [the amount of mould is] going to be different based on the season, who lives in the house, whether there is a cat or dog, whether someone's been for a walk in nature in the last week,"" she said. ""So that's what I'm focusing on, because once you can measure how much people are exposed … you can see whether there is causal evidence."" Dr Law is also part of a research team funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) investigating whether there are clear biomarkers associated with CIRS. ""We hope to really gain some traction with the NHMRC funding and work out a way to screen for it."" While some of the health impacts of mould exposure are still to be determined, Ms Jones says it's widely recognised that poor housing quality, including mouldy and damp living conditions, increases the risk of poor health outcomes. The World Health Organization has previously estimated that mould affects between 10 and 50 per cent of homes in Australia. Research suggests these are more likely to be in low-income communities. ""The WHO says there is no safe level of exposure to the toxins from mould,"" she said. Well-designed and well-maintained homes are critical to the prevention of mould, but Dr Law says a lack of agreed exposure standards means measures to ensure adequate ventilation and to limit condensation aren't always enforced. ""Very often, these things are not dealt with, and the occupant is the one that bears the consequences of mould and so forth,"" he said. ""Given how prevalent mould already is … we really need to look at this more carefully."" Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice. Where possible, it's important people remove any mould growth in their home, and take steps to prevent it from growing back, Ms Jones says. ""The number one thing is to keep your house dry: prevent moisture in any way you can … that could be with dehumidifiers, or with ventilation. ""And check the tenancy regulations in your state if you're a renter. ""They vary state by state, but a few states do say if it's a structural problem that causes mould, it's the landlord's responsibility to fix it."" In addition to reducing the amount of moisture, Professor Van Nunen recommended people use a vinegar solution to remove mould instead of bleach. ""In most cases, if you use bleach, a background level of mould spores will remain and you're not really getting rid of it. Whereas vinegar will do it."" It's also important to remember that in some cases, when the mould is widespread or your health is being compromised, it may be necessary to bring in professional help.

1,"Small in size, big in impact, scientists fear end for microscopic species",science,"  Impacts of farming put microorganisms, rare ecosystems at risk at Mount Canobolas Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An increase in the number of threatened tiny plant species in country New South Wales is putting rare ecosystems at risk, according to scientists. Mount Canobolas, near Orange in the state's central-west, is home to more than 1,000 species, making it one of the most densely populated habitats in the country. But there have been 18 species deemed threatened and four endangered in the area in the past decade. Many of them are tiny organisms that can only be seen with a microscope. Macquarie University honorary postdoctoral associate Alison Downing said microorganisms such as lichens and mosses played a vital role in the ecosystem. ""They act to trap moisture and soil and by doing this they actually stabilise the whole environment,"" she said. ""They make it easier for other flowering plants to grow in that area, in turn, assisting wildlife."" Dr Downing said the microorganisms were previously found across the state but mismanagement of livestock had resulted in only small, isolated communities remaining. ""One of the problems is with stock cattle in particular, they are really hard-hoofed animals so as they go through, they effectively cut up these soil crusts and convert them to dust,"" Dr Downing said. ""If you have a bad sandstorm or a windy day, they [microorganisms] will just be blown away along with the topsoil."" Mount Canobolas is part of a 1,672-hectare state conservation area. A volcanic eruption 11 million years ago gave the region its rich, fertile soil and altitude. According to the NSW Farmers Association, this has made the region one of the state's prime agricultural regions, contributing almost $2 billion to the economy each year. Orange Field Naturalist Society member Richard Medd said losing the microorganisms, such as mosses and lichens, created a chain reaction. ""All of those species interact with each other,"" he said. He said taking one or two out would affect several others. ""They won't survive,"" he said. ""As soon as you break them up it plays havoc."" Dr Medd said Mount Canobolas was a rare oasis for tiny species. ""If the communities are fragmented then they lose their integrity and those ecosystems start to break down,"" Dr Medd said. ""We are seeing that in major habitats throughout Australia in the deserts, in the Great Barrier Reef, in the alpine areas."" He said if was not all doom and gloom for the Mount Canobolas ecosystem though after researchers found at least 15 new species for the region. Polyrichum commune is a species of moss that is typically found in the alpine regions of Tasmania and the Snowy Mountains. Dr Downing and Dr Medd stumbled across the bryophyte organism while conducting a survey on Mount Canobolas. ""It is really quite exciting, it is not particularly a rare species, but we haven't ever recorded it here,"" Dr Downing said. About 70 per cent of Mount Canobolas was destroyed by a bushfire that required more than 100 firefighters to put out in 2018. Dr Medd said the fire most likely allowed microorganisms that had previously been lying dormant in the soil, such as the polyrichum commune, to sprout.

2,"The first humans emerged long before our own species. So, who were they?",science," Science Who was the first human? Identifying them is tricky, but it was not our species, Homo sapiens Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Where did we come from? There's something about human evolution that's inherently intriguing; it stirs an innate curiosity about what came before (and lived and died and bred with) our species, Homo sapiens. But where in our ancestry does the ""human"" part of ""human evolution"" begin? In other words, how far back in time must we go for our ancestors to not be human and be, instead, an ape walking on two legs? What's needed to qualify as ""human""? Getting to the bottom of this is more complicated than it appears, says Tanya Smith, a human evolutionary biologist at Griffith University. Half a jawbone and stone tools are dated around 180,000 years old, pushing modern human migration out of Africa back 60,000 years. More than a century ago, scientists began classifying fossils depending on whether they appeared to have looked and acted more in line with humans living today — that's us — than ancient hominins, such as the ape-like Australopithecus afarensis, nicknamed Lucy, which lived a few million years ago. ""Originally it was things like brain size, tool use — what we thought of as hallmark specialisations of humanity that would be different from earlier Australopithecines,"" Professor Smith says. In the years since, though, fossil discoveries overturned some of those assumptions. So where are we at? Let's start with the here and now. We, Homo sapiens, are in the human bucket — we define what is human. We're backed up by the Macquarie Dictionary, which states a ""human"" is ""a human being"", which, in turn, is ""a member of the human race, Homo sapiens"". Contrary to the Macquarie Dictionary, though, we're not alone in the historical human bucket. So, let's take a whistlestop tour of our evolutionary history and see where we end up. Travel back in time a few tens of thousands of years, and there were other two-legged primates that looked a lot like us getting around the planet. They included our closest cousins Homo neanderthalis, better known as Neanderthals, and a group some consider a sister lineage of Neanderthals called the Denisovans. Skeletons show Neanderthals were muscular and a bit shorter than us, but had a bigger brain for their size. The Denisovan portrait is fuzzier — the entire reported suite of Denisovan fossils could be counted on two hands — but they likely resembled Neanderthals. We don't know a huge amount about Neanderthal behaviour, but what's increasingly clear is they weren't the knuckle-dragging, club-wielding oafs depicted in popular culture. They made tools and art and engaged in symbolic behaviours, creating objects that had uses beyond consuming food. ""You can find … teeth that had been pierced potentially for wearing or adorning things, and these are from sites that were really strongly associated with Neanderthals,"" Professor Smith says. ""So it does seem like some basic abstraction and symbolism was practised, at least by the later Neanderthals."" Whether those behaviours originated within Neanderthal groups or were copied when they came in contact with Homo sapiens, we don't know, Professor Smith says. ""But we do know that this definition that only Homo sapiens made art and only Homo sapiens engaged in what seems like abstraction … is falling away."" Alongside fossils and other archaeological remains, traces of Neanderthals and Denisovans are found today as stretches of DNA in our genome, remnants of interbreeding through the ages — not just with us, but with each other too. Our species, Homo sapiens, evolved in a single region in southern Africa around 300,000 years ago, a new study suggests. But not everyone agrees. So, Professor Smith says, instead of thinking of our species' evolution as a ""family tree"" — with branches splitting into two species, then going on to split again or become a dead end — think of it more like a braided river, where multiple water channels diverge, flow for a bit, then come back together. ""It's the idea of genetic information potentially mixing in some populations, then splitting, then later in time mixing again and splitting again."" These ancient encounters prompted some researchers to suggest the three types of human should be considered the same species, Australian National University evolutionary biologist João Teixiera says. ""But the truth is, genetic evidence suggests Neanderthals and Denisovans at least are part of the human family."" Could the answer to our question be as simple as nomenclature? The Homo part of our and Neanderthals' Latin name means ""human"" or ""man"". Over the decades, more members have been added to the Homo genus, such as Homo floresiensis, perhaps better known as ""The Hobbit"", and Homo naledi. So would the first human be the first Homo? Well … maybe, La Trobe University archaeologist Andy Herries says. ""If we define something in the genus Homo, then we're defining that it is fundamentally more like us. ""The earliest Homo is the beginning of what it means to be human, in a sense."" And yet, this is not without controversy. ""Strictly speaking, the oldest fossil that has been included in the genus Homo is 2.8 million years old from Ledi-Geraru in Ethiopia,"" Professor Herries says. ""But lots of people disagree entirely with that assessment. It's half a mandible."" What about cultural practices, like burying their dead, or symbolic representations? ""The behavioural evidence is spotty,"" Professor Smith says. Bones have been unearthed by an international team of archaeologists who say they're part of the oldest known human modern burial site in Africa. ""From that period, they were using tools, but we don't know that they were using fire, and certainly we don't think we're burying their dead or creating symbolic representations of things. ""It's not 'til much later in the record that we would get some of the things that we think of as contemporary behaviours."" The likely ""first human"", she says, was Homo erectus. These short, stocky humans were a real stayer in human evolutionary history. Estimates vary, but they're thought to have lived from around 2 million to 100,000 years ago, and were the first humans to walk out of Africa and push into Europe and Asia. They're credited with abstraction, as evidenced by an engraved shell some half a million years old. Neanderthals, H. sapiens and Denisovans are considered by some to have evolved from H. erectus populations in different parts of the world: Neanderthals in Europe, H. sapiens in Africa, and perhaps Denisovans in Asia. Well … even this is tricky, because there's an older Homo than H. erectus. Meet Homo habilis, or ""handy man"", named because fossil remains were found near a plethora of stone tools. It appeared on the scene around 300,000 years before the earliest known H. erectus, and its placement in the Homo genus has been contentious, to say the least. Some researchers suggest it's ape-like enough that it should be shifted to the more ancient Australopithecines, which would strip it of its human or Homo name. By this point, we've travelled a couple of million years back in human history. Fossilised remains from around the time and earlier are incredibly rare, and what is unearthed tends to be in bits. ""Rarely do you get a full suite of evidence in a single individual. So you'll get a bit of a skull, and then you'll get a bit of a hand and you'll get a bit of a pelvis and you get a couple teeth, but we don't know how they knit together,"" Professor Smith says. ""It's only later in the fossil record that we have good, full remains from a single Homo erectus. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. ""Then you have sites where we know we had multiple individuals living at the same time, but [the fossils and artefacts] don't come with labels when you get them out of the ground."" Plus there's the gradual nature of evolution itself, Professor Herries says. ""There are so many different aspects of what makes us human, but they don't all arrive at the same time — that never happens. ""[Walking upright] usually comes first, then potentially stone tools, and then we get big brains, which should be no real great surprise because stone tools allow you to access a much wider range of resources, and that helps your brain get bigger."" So, while there's no absolute line in history with humans on one side and apes on the other, Professor Herries agrees the first human by contemporary measure was likely a Homo erectus. ""There was a big evolutionary step that happened at about 2 million years to 1.8 million years, at that switch to Homo erectus, that moves towards more complicated stone tools and behaviour. They were the first global travellers. ""They did a lot of things for the first time."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

3,"Welcome to a new kind of house, packed with features seldom seen before COVID-19",science," Science Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog ""The Barnaby"" might be a strange name for a home of the future, but that's what this four-bedroom demonstration house claims to be. Located in a small town in North Carolina, it's the size of an average new house in Australia and looks pretty normal from the outside. Inside, the differences are obvious: a front-door ""vestibule"" for no-contact home delivery, two ""pocket"" home offices (neither of which is a bedroom), a school room, a quarantine room, a ""secret room"" behind a bookcase (for being alone), and a whopping four bathrooms. In case you haven't guessed it yet, this is a design shaped by the pandemic. The team of architects, social researchers, and marketing experts that dreamed it up say every detail is informed by insights from a survey into the impact of the pandemic on homes and communities in the US. What about in Australia? Here, the property industry is seeing demand for features like those of The Barnaby (though not four bathrooms). The dedicated home office is king, and there's generally greater appreciation for good design and quality of construction. COVID-19 shone a light on all the pre-existing problems with our housing and asked us to do more with our houses, including working from home (WFH). So, what does an ideal post-COVID Australian home look like? And will any actually get built? The Barnaby's design choices were informed by the America at Home study, which surveyed more than 6,000 US adults in 2020. There's a new commercial rush to automate our homes and appliances. Is this how we'll live in the future? It found that Millennials and Gen Xers wanted relatively uncommon features such as germ-resistant countertops and flooring, greater energy efficiency, more storage for food or water, touch-free taps, appliances and toilets, and space for more than one home office. ""Post-pandemic, people have realised their homes can do more and that better design matters,"" said Nancy Keenan, president and chief executive officer of Dahlin Group Architecture Planning, the California-based firm that helped design The Barnaby demonstration house. Key to making a home do more is something called ""the flex space"", or a room with multiple potential uses. What this boils down to is an open-plan living room and kitchen, and then lots of ""acoustically secure"" (ie. decently soundproofed) medium-sized rooms that could be home offices, bedrooms, media rooms, and the like. Along with this, there's a scattering of tiny ""pocket flex spaces"" that could be used as smaller studies or walk-in wardrobes. The idea is that a whole family (The Barnaby was designed for a Millennial couple with two young children, where one parent works from home) can use the one house for lots of different things, all at the same time. ""Providing spaces in the home that can be used in many ways is key to a successful floor plan, especially when designing to smaller square footages,"" Ms Keenan said. ""Our clients are also exploring the viability of optioning flexible furniture systems and moveable walls to enhance space flexibility."" These trends can be seen in Australia. Every two years, property developer Mirvac surveys customers about what they're looking for in a house or an apartment. The most recent survey showed a clear shift in thinking, said Diana Sarcasmo, head of design at Mirvac, which has $26 billion worth of assets under management in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. ""Half the people we spoke to in the survey said they were looking for a hybrid working arrangement going forward,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. That change is reflected in demand for home offices. ""There's been a 20 per cent increase in people in apartments asking for a study. And in housing, there's double the number."" The surge in pet ownership during lockdowns means people are willing to pay extra for doggy doors and dog-wash facilities. And hours spent WFH has made people aware of ""sustainability upgrades"" like thermal insulation. In the short space of one year, Annabelle and Alex have slashed the money they spend on electricity, gas and petrol to zero. Here's how they did it. ""People have always wanted sustainability upgrades, but weren't willing to pay for them,"" Ms Sarcasmo said. ""Now 64 per cent say they're willing to pay extra. That's a massive shift over the last couple of years."" George Massoud, design director at Frasers Property, another large developer, agreed. He's also seen people placing greater value on ""things like quality of light, ventilation, and acoustics"". And the home office with a door you can close is here to stay. ""The mediocre study nook doesn't cut it anymore."" Of course, it's harder finding space for all this in an apartment. Since the onset of COVID-19, house values have out-performed those of units. And dwelling values (houses and units) in regional areas have increased much more than those in capital cities. Eliza Owen, head of research at CoreLogic Australia, said the need for space was a contributing factor. ""Larger, more spacious homes allowed for a home office, and larger properties in regional Australia even allowed people to create their own oasis for entertainment and recreation amid the pandemic,"" she said. So are Australians ditching the inner-city apartment? No, Ms Sarcasmo says. ""There was a feeling during the middle of the pandemic that people would be driven further out of the city,"" she said. ""But in the last several months, what we've seen is great demand for apartment projects, if they're well located with amenities."" Mr Massoud, agreed: the picture was more complicated than Australians buying large houses in regional areas. Size matters, but so does, increasingly, location. People want to live in urban environments that are within walking distance to parks, cafes, pubs, restaurants, and the like. One reason for this may be the rise of WFH: We're taking greater interest in our local community. ""In homes and the apartment space, people are really assessing what's beyond their four walls,"" Mr Massoud said. He also believes homes won't get much bigger. ""I don't see larger homes being a trend, but I do see major improvements in quality."" Though Australia doesn't yet have its own version of The Barnaby , architects are working at imagining how our houses and apartments might be better designed to suit our needs. In March this year, a Brisbane exhibition featured the work of 10 Australian architects who had been invited to develop new concepts of the home and residential environments. The designs included a much greater focus on community and connection, including shared amenities for apartments, as well as verandahs, walkways, and verge gardens to connect neighbours. The exhibition itself was the idea of the Architecture et Cetera Lab, formed by three Griffith University design academics and practising architects, Cecilia Bischeri, Zuzana Kovar and Jessica Blair. ""COVID put what we consider normality under scrutiny,"" Dr Bischeri said. ""Residential space is becoming a habitat, in the sense we are going to function 24/7 in this space. ""Houses need to accommodate all interests and activities that in a normal situation you would experience outside."" Residential architects have seen a big increase in demand for their services, said Shannon Battisson, national president of the Australian Institute of Architects (AIA). In Canberra, where she works, public servants have been spending money on their homes, rather than on overseas holidays. ""One of the big things COVID has done has made people think, 'Hey, we might spend a lot of time here in the future and it's worth doing it well.' ""We went from having a six-month waiting list for our projects, and then that blew out to two years."" What people want isn't the only factor that decides what gets built. Most new apartments, for instance, are built for investors rather than owner-occupiers, says Tom Alves, head of development at the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. ""The shape and form of those apartments is not driven by need, but by global investment,"" he said. Houses are similar: Less than 6 per cent of new houses in Australia have architectural involvement. So far, COVID-19 hasn't had a big impact on the regulation determining the minimum standards for houses and units, Dr Alves said. The 2021 update to the Victorian Government's 2017 Better Apartment Design Standards addressed problems with poor acoustic and visual privacy, a lack of natural light, and an inflexible floor plan. Outlining the changes, the Victorian Government website states: ""More than ever, the coronavirus pandemic has shown us that all homes need to have access to air, nature, sunlight and personal space."" Other states and territories have not updated their apartment design standards since the outbreak of COVID-19. The National Construction Code, which sets minimum performance and quality requirements for new housing in Australia, is in the process of being updated to ensure homes are better insulated and energy efficient (though this was set in train well before the pandemic). COVID-19 will change design in Australia, but it may not be as widespread as we might like, Ms Battisson said. ""I think we'll be quick to revert to our usual ways."" But there is one sign of hope, at least in her opinion: fewer people are asking for home theatres. ""We're really against things like home theatres — it's a room that's pretty big and dark and can't be used for anything else. ""In COVID, not a single person asked for a home theatre. ""I'm kind of hoping they won't come back strongly after the pandemic."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

4,School kids recruited to help bring endangered sea lions 'back from the brink',science,"  School students enlisted to help bring endangered sea lions 'back from the brink' Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog South Australian researchers are hoping school students will help play a vital role in the conservation of Australian sea lions. The species is endemic to Australia, with more than 80 per cent of the population found in South Australian waters. But the marine mammal was recently declared endangered, with numbers declining, according to one study, by around 60 per cent in the last 40 years. Scientists are now endeavouring to collate as much data as possible on sea lions' breeding habits and population trends to inform the next steps in conservation efforts — and they are calling on the public, including school students, for help. The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPSW) of South Australia recently launched a website called Sea Lion Spotter, which enables citizen scientists to help identify and classify sea lions from thousands of drone images captured during surveys of sea lion colonies. The website provides an introduction to identifying the sea lions, before users are asked to click on the mammals they can spot amongst rocky coastal outcrops and tag them as either males, females, or pups. Marine coordinator for NPSW SA, Dirk Holman, said the Sea Lion Spotter site would give the animals greater public visibility. ""Because of the nature of where they live and where they breed, they're out of sight and out of mind,"" he said. ""By bringing Sea Lion Spotter and sea lions to people who can sit and classify them at home, they get an interest and hopefully become advocates for a species that's in decline."" A group of school students this week attended a presentation on sea lions at Adelaide Zoo to learn about how to get involved in the conservation of the species, using a familiar concept. ""It's like Where's Wally where you have to find a sea lion and then classify it,"" year 7 student Joshua said. ""I'll definitely use Sea Lion Spotter because it seems like it'll be really fun to do and I'll feel like I'm helping … I just like the thought that the sea lions will be fine. ""Just looking at this I can see that sea lions are really intelligent animals and they deserve to be in this world."" Mr Holman said the website has so far been a big hit. ""We've had people from 22 different countries — people as far away as Russia — giving it a go,"" he said. ""The data will go into population surveys. ""We're monitoring pup production so all that data they collect and put into the system will go into our long term database."" Scientists have a big task ahead in addressing the multitude of threats the colonies face, Mr Holman said. ""There are a lot of threats which are impacting on the species,"" he said. ""They're mainly human-induced unfortunately, from commercial fisheries bycatch to marine debris, to habitat destruction, climate change, prey depletion, diseases and parasites, pollutants in the water."" But Mr Holman is clear on one thing: there remains hope for Australian sea lions — especially with the interest of a new generation of conservationists. ""The more we can invest in monitoring and research, and understand what these stressors are and how we can prevent them from entering the ecosystem, hopefully we can bring the species back from the brink,"" he said. ""It's been a real highlight to see [students] not only take an interest in the sea lions but a lot of them picked up some of the messaging we were talking about. ""To hear that they want to go home and use the Sea Lion Spotter app is just so rewarding.""

5,Forgotten what day it is again? You're not alone,science,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog What day is it again? Did I already go grocery shopping this week? Who sent me that text I need to reply to? With most of Australia well out of lockdown — and even returning to some pre-COVID routines — why is it that many of us are still experiencing memory problems? Lockdowns were stressful for many people and for a long period of time. People were adapting to working from home, learning how to home school, experiencing job loss, caring for sick family members, not to mention actually getting COVID-19 or the fear of getting it. Over weeks and months of lockdowns — and then more weeks and months of changing restrictions — we've had little to no relief. ""That chronic stress response accumulates and takes a toll on brain function,"" says neuroscientist Dr Lila Landowski from the University of Tasmania. ""Stress is a hard-wired physical response that affects our entire body,"" Dr Landowski explains. ""While brief moments of stress can help us reach our peak performance, when that stress persists over months to years, it can have damaging effects on the body — including altering brain structure and function."" For example, the hippocampus — where short-term memory is stored — can shrink due to prolonged exposure to stress hormones such as cortisol. ""The connections between neurons in the hippocampus become weaker, making it difficult to retain information,"" she says. ""Therefore, a chronically stressed person might have trouble keeping track of what they are doing or have a hard time remembering things."" In our so-called COVID-normal lives, we're also grappling with new stressors. Everything from remembering to bring a mask with you when you leave home to keeping across the changing restrictions, means there's an extra load on our brain that we're not used to. We have to weigh-up new risks for everyday activities, such as ducking down to the local shops or visiting grandparents in aged care. All of this causes stresses which, in turn, impacts on memory and increases forgetfulness. ""Everything has become a bit harder in the pandemic,"" says Dr Celia Harris, vice-chancellor's senior research fellow in cognitive neuroscience at the University of Western Sydney. ""This means that we are doing extra cognitive work all the time, and this acts like an extra load on our cognitive functioning that makes routine tasks more difficult and more likely to fail."" Even returning to pre-COVID activities — such as going to work and taking the kids to school — may result in the memory-impairing effects of chronic stress. ""Returning to work means returning to the stress of bumper-to-bumper traffic for the long work commute home,"" Dr Landowski says. ""It might mean risking the health of the family by potentially bringing COVID home from work [to] them."" As we forge new routines and return to old ones, memory will likely improve — and ""lost"" memories may return. ""Current theories of memory argue that memory is a function of the similarity between the conditions of remembering and the conditions in which memory was formed,"" says Dr Adam Osth, senior lecturer in psychology at The University of Melbourne. ""In other words, when you're sad, it's easier to remember memories of when you're sad,"" he explains, ""but harder to remember memories [of] when you're happy."" So, if you're experiencing continued stress, this may affect your ability to remember events from more peaceful times in your life. ""If someone is, instead, experiencing 'ups and downs' right now, their memories will fluctuate right along with that emotional rollercoaster,"" Dr Osth says. So you may remember something one day, but forget it the next — or vice versa. ""This may lead to some feelings like their memory is acting up. We expect that things that are forgotten should stay forgotten,"" Dr Osth says. ""But this is exactly consistent with how our memories work. ""The important thing is that being unable to remember something doesn't necessarily mean the memory is lost."" To improve your memory, Dr Landowski recommends three things: exercise, sleep, and socialising. ""By increasing blood flow to the body, exercise delivers more oxygen and nutrients to the brain, it releases feel-good endorphins and growth factors that support the growth of new neurons,"" Dr Landowski says. She says to aim for 150 minutes of heart-pumping, sweat-inducing exercise per week. ""Socialising with people you like — especially when you engage in physical contact — releases a cocktail of neurotransmitters in your brain, which has an array of effects, including reducing the levels of the stress hormone cortisol,"" she adds. Dr Osth recommends steering clear of things that permanently damage memories, ""like drinking too much alcohol or sleeping poorly"". ""Most of the memory-related disturbances should become normal-ish when life circumstances return to normal."" On the flip side, he adds, ""when the pandemic ends, people may have an easier time remembering pre-pandemic memories, but have a harder time remembering pandemic memories"". Dr Harris advocates using memory tools. ""If your memory is failing, outsource it to your lists, calendars, and smart phone,"" she says. ""Part of the solution is recognising where you are having trouble remembering and consciously engaging strategies to address it — and recognising that we've all been through an ongoing major upheaval, and it is to be expected that we might be functioning in different ways [than] before.""

7,Sage whispers: Shallow waters help whale mums and calves evade predators,science,"  Whale mums and calves whisper, hide from predators off Great Australian Bight, researchers say Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog New research shows southern right whales in the Great Australia Bight might be using the shallow waters to whisper to their calves so that predators, like killer whales, can't hear them. Acoustic crypsis, a way of adapting sound production behaviour akin to whispering, could be leading whales to choose certain breeding grounds to whisper to their calves. The study by Syracuse University in New York looked at whale talk, comparing data from Brazil, South Africa and southern Australia to come to their theoretical findings. Researcher Julia Zeh said the team studied how sound travelled in the habitat where southern right whales and calves spent a lot of their time. ""What we found is that they are potentially using these shallow waters, near shore habitats in part because that way they can't be heard by other animals outside those habitats,"" Ms Zeh said. ""They can make sounds and communicate with each other but their sounds won't travel far enough to be heard by anyone else."" She said the habitats were surprising for such large creatures. ""These mum-calf pairs spend time in these ridiculously shallow areas across the southern hemisphere,"" she said. ""We started out doing work in Brazil with these mum-calf pairs and they're found in waters that are just a few metres deep ,which is crazy considering that a whale is pretty wide on its own. ""They're in just a tiny bit of water and because of the ground there and the water, the sound waves will get absorbed very quickly."" Ms Zeh is one of three researchers who produced the paper, which was published in Royal Society Open Science. Other work has been done on the whispering between mothers and calves but this research explored the benefits of shallow habitats. ""Some of the recent publications about these mum-calf pairs has shown that they do whisper and that they make some quieter calls to each other to communicate with each other,"" Ms Zeh said. ""So people started noticing they are doing these acoustically hiding things and then we found not only do they modify the sounds that they are producing, they may also be choosing locations to spend time in to hide as well."" Ms Zeh said while it was not known why the whales were hiding and whispering, there were theories. ""The primary predator of these large baleen whales, pretty much their only predator, is killer whales and especially for the vulnerable calves,"" Ms Zeh said. ''That's a risk, being herded by those whales but it may also be adult males of the same species. ""There have been incidents of harassment by the adult males, especially around the mating season if they're trying to mate with females. ""The harassment could cause injury to the young calves so it may also be that they're hiding from them as well."" Ms Zeh said the paper opened the door for more study including how changes in the physical environment, noise or human activity could impact or relate to changes in whale behaviour. She said technology was enabling eavesdropping and one day researchers might know what whales were saying. ""I think we're getting closer to [understanding whale calls] but it's a lot more complicated than a simple translation,"" Ms Zeh said. ""We really have to understand the sensory perspective of those animals that are very different from the way we experience the world. ""But I think we're getting a better understanding of that.""

8,"At 21, Nilsson killed someone. He hopes his story will stop others going down the same dark road",science,"  Nilsson Smyth's reckless driving killed someone and he went to jail. He wants to stop others taking that road Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Nilsson Smyth was six years old his older brother Jammie died in a road accident. Years later, Mr Smyth's decision to get behind the wheel of a car drunk and lead police on a high-speed chase caused the death of his passenger. As a then 21-year-old, he had plenty of insight into the grief his actions had caused. ""I did the number one thing that I hated the most,"" Mr Smyth said, recalling the 2011 accident near Bonegilla in north-east Victoria. ""I lost my brother, and I ended up taking the life of someone. ""Life's about choice and consequence and for that choice I'll be living with that consequence for the rest of my life."" In 2013, Mr Smyth received a nine-year prison sentence for his role in the fatal accident and served a non-parole period of six years before being released on probation. While he was incarcerated, he accepted the counselling and education offered to him. Mr Smyth said he was supported to heal and learn from his mistakes. ""I knew things weren't right. I was a serious felon offender too, so I looked into why I used to commit these crimes and why I turned to alcohol abuse,"" he said. ""I had a massive identity crisis."" Mr Smyth said his life in Yarrawonga after prison was unrecognisable compared to how he lived before. Today he is an apprentice carpenter, a father, and he is engaged to be married. ""After 15 years I finally have my full licence,"" he said. ""I've got a six-page criminal history of mostly car-related offences and for me to grow up and mature and be accountable behind the wheel and be a safe driver, that was quite a massive step for me."" Mental harm can last long after physical injuries have healed, said Road Trauma Support Services Victoria (RTSSV) regional coordinator Carmel Maher. Ms Maher works closely with people affected by road trauma: injured people, carers, witnesses, people who offer assistance at the scene, first responders and families, friends and colleagues of those who lose their lives on the road. ""Road trauma is different for everyone,"" Ms Maher said. ""A parent losing their child or caring for their child is very different to someone who has been involved in a crash. ""But I do think there are some commonalities in that losing someone, treating someone, caring for someone, witnessing a crash, sustaining serious injuries, or even living with being at fault can have impacts ranging from being really shocking to devastating and life changing. ""Sometimes the body can heal much quicker than the mind can."" Mr Smyth knows the pain of losing a loved one on the road and the horror of causing a fatal accident. ""There's no hierarchy of trauma,"" he said. ""Trauma is trauma, whether it's a small incident, a big incident — we all suffer the same side effects."" Mr Smyth acquired a traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic amnesia from his accident and was in a coma for two weeks after the crash. He said the mental impact was worse than his physical injuries. ""Still to this day the hardest thing I've ever done [is hear from] my mum and a counsellor while I'm doing rehab in hospital that I've killed someone,"" he said. ""Still to this day I can't believe that happened."" RTSSV offers free counselling to anyone who has been affected by road trauma, and connects people from across the state with others who are going through similar experiences. Now an RTSSV volunteer, Mr Smyth hoped sharing his story would help prevent future tragedies. ""It wasn't just a six-year, nine-year jail term — it's about every day grieving and trying to not let those ...mistakes be forgotten about,"" he said. ""Nothing changes the fact that I've taken the life of someone who meant something to people, a family member. ""They suffer it every year on birthdays, on Christmas, on family vacations, every time they set the table. ""And I don't know how they live life without their family member because I hate living my life without my older brother.""

9,Remote WA art gallery welcomes visitors back after two years of COVID isolation,science,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A world-renowned art gallery in a small Kimberley community has reopened to the public after a prolonged closure due to the pandemic. Warmun Arts Centre was closed for two years and two months after Aboriginal communities in Western Australia were placed into mandated closure to non-residents. While access was still restricted to Indigenous communities, Warmun's acclaimed art centre was on the outskirts of the community, on a riverbank opposite residents, and would operate under strict COVID protocols. ""It's exciting,"" art centre manager Melissa Callanan said of the May 16 reopening. ""I want to pay a play tribute to the elder group in the community because we had an extraordinarily high vaccination rate, which has ultimately made this possible."" The gallery used the two years of closure to reinvigorate its interior, repainting walls, improving curation skills of locals and showing works through new virtual software. Artists painted from home, with supplies of canvas, brushes and paints dropped off in bundles. Like many remote art centres, it also boosted online sales during the pandemic. ""We've done well in the closure time, we've actually done incredibly well. We've maintained our sales,"" Ms Callanan said. Surprisingly the strong demand from galleries for the centre's more expensive works by Elders and senior artists, which are not usually sold through online methods, also held up. ""In the first year of lockdown we held 28 exhibitions — two in London, one in Berlin plus Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide."" ""Our Elders are extremely well recognised nationally and internationally,"" Ms Callanan said. ""People like Shirley Purdie, she had a major acquisition through the Museum of Contemporary Art and was showing there last year and she had a sell-out exhibition in Sydney. ""And of course, we have Mabel Juli, who we call our rock star and we have constant requests for commissions of her very famous Moon and Star which is at the Museum of Contemporary Art and also held by the National Gallery of Australia."" Ms Callanan said the gallery, owned by the Gija people, had worked hard to maintain profits returning to the community, because external galleries would deduct commissions. ""Last year we thought we have to start to work harder to make more direct sales, because that's better for the community members and better for artists,"" she said. ""A lot of the major art fairs went online last year. That means those sales come to us directly."" Warmun's artists have strong connections to their heritage and country, and have overcome adversity, including when the gallery was rebuilt after floods ripped through in March 2011. The board was keen to welcome visitors back but visitors must follow COVID-19 prevention guidelines, including taking a rapid test, which will be provided free of charge.

10,Worried you're boring? This study might make you feel better — or worse,science,"  Study to find the most boring jobs and hobbies comes up with surprising results Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Do other people think you're boring? At some stage, we've all wondered how other people see us and the idea that they would find our lives yawn-worthy is, well, worrying. RN Drive brings you a fresh perspective on the day's top national and international stories. In fact, a recent study entitled Boring people: Stereotype characteristics, interpersonal attributions and social reactions, published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, addressed this very topic, surveying hundreds of people online in the US and the UK. ""Whether we admit it or not, we want people to find us interesting and to like us,"" Olivia Henry, from the Australian Science Media Centre, tells ABC RN Drive. But the study's findings were not good news for some. The researchers rated the most boring hobbies, jobs, characteristics and places to live. Careers considered to be more boring included data analysts, accountants and people who worked in taxation, Ms Henry says. By contrast, some of the least boring jobs were those of scientists, researchers and journalists. ""The most boring hobbies were sleeping, religious activities, watching TV, observing animals and doing maths,"" she adds. And the least boring hobbies named in the recent study included being ""weird"", ""nerdy"", having specific disinterests and having an interest in science and music. One of the study's authors, social psychologist Wijnand Van Tilburg says he was surprised by some of these findings. ""People see mathematics and data analysis as stereotypically boring but see scientists as not stereotypically boring. ""Guess what scientists do? A lot of data analysis and maths,"" he says. ""I think that these kinds of findings really show the subjectiveness of these stereotypes. The terms one uses to describe oneself — scientist vs analysing data; mathematics vs being nerdy — has a major impact on how people see us."" Someone who has experienced this sort of stereotyping is Brisbane-based data scientist Daniel Kennedy. He's previously worked in genetics and did his PhD on trying to determine the different genetic factors in diseases. Now he works in charity fundraising, using data to discover an optimised audience. (Source: van Tilburg, Igou, Panjwani: Boring People: Stereotype Characteristics, Interpersonal Attributions, and Social Reactions) Yet, despite his job title rating badly in the findings, some of his hobbies fall under the least boring of those identified in the study — he's interested in music, playing piano and he recently took up the harmonica. However, he says he's had mixed experiences when asked about his job at parties or functions. Sometimes people are interested and will dig a bit deeper. ""Because I think data scientist is a little bit more interesting … or buzzworthy than statistician, which is the other term that I would call myself,"" he says. ""But quite often, there's just a sort of slight moment of silence. And then they'll [ask my fiance] 'Anna, what do you do?'"" He understands how those people feel though. ""I have to admit, when somebody says that they're an accountant, I struggle to think of the next question to be interested myself. So I definitely understand … the mental wall that appears … when you say that you're a data scientist."" The researchers involved in the recent study were astounded by some of the report's other findings. For instance, Dr Van Tilburg says that it wasn't surprising that stereotypically boring people were seen as unpleasant to socialise with, but the researcher had not expected them to be seen as incompetent at what they do. ""It is quite unusual for groups of people to be stereotyped as both low on personal warmth and competence,"" he says. ""So, instead of finding that, say, accountants are stereotyped as 'boring to be around but excellent at their jobs', we surprisingly found that such groups are also stereotyped and seen as less talented. Of course, these are just stereotypes and are unlikely to be correct."" Yet sometimes stereotypes are based on past experiences. Dr Nikki-Anne Wilson, post-doctoral research fellow at Neuroscience Research Australia, says the brain has a remarkable ability to make inferences about other people and their thoughts, feelings and behaviour. ""The best way of predicting the future — at least as far as our brains are concerned — is to use the information we already have,"" Dr Wilson says. ""[So] if we've always had a good time with Bob but lunches with Sarah always tend to drag, this will understandably influence our future expectations in these relationships."" Past experiences become more powerful when combined with social and cultural norms, she adds. ""Our brains like to make connections between pieces of information and will filter incoming information through this existing knowledge,"" she explains. ""If Sarah happens to be an accountant and we've previously been exposed to social and cultural norms suggesting accountants are boring, we may be more likely to perceive poor Sarah as boring."" Dr Van Tilburg says the study also revealed how much perceptions can change over time. ""For example, we found that smoking was seen as stereotypically boring,"" he says. ""When I grew up, smoking was still considered something 'cool'. Over time that image has changed, but I had not expected that smoking would be seen as something that stereotypically boring people do."" There's a caveat to the findings — the study only included participants from the USA and the UK. Dr Van Tilburg says it would be good to extend the study to include a more diverse set of participants. It's likely that the stereotype of boring people differs across countries and cultures, he adds. ""Having participants from elsewhere would help us get a better picture of the stereotype of boring people."" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

11,"Broome's 'staircase to the moon' a unique combination of tides, location and cosmic angles",science,"  Broome's 'staircase to the moon' effect a unique combination of tides, location and cosmic angles Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Broome's staircase to the moon phenomenon draws thousands of people from around the world to Roebuck Bay annually, but the science behind the spectacle is just as fascinating. The effect creates what appears to be a glowing staircase over the mudflats leading to a full moon, a combination of location and conditions unique to Western Australia's north. ""During dry season, three times a month, there's an alignment between the Earth, the sun and the moon which creates big tides, or spring tides,"" Broome astronomer Greg Quicke said. ""That means we've got high tide at lunch time and low tide in the evening [so] all the mudflats are wet. ""The ripples in the mud have water in them, and they create a direct reflection of the moon as it appears over the horizon."" This is what gives the reflection its ""staircase"" appearance. Mr Quicke said the location of Roebuck Bay made the occurrence possible. ""Broome is blessed to sit on a peninsula that's 10 kilometres long and 4km wide,"" he said. ""Roebuck Bay faces the east, and that's where the Earth turns to the part of the sky that the moon is in, at a particular time. ""Tonight, it's 6:27pm, or something."" ""Every one of them is different; you never know what you're going to get."" Long-time Broome tourism operator Robyn Maher said people came to Broome to coincide with the natural phenomenon, from March through to October. ""If you're in Broome for the three dates, make sure you see the staircase each evening,"" he said. ""There might be a bit of cloud this evening, but the next two nights the colours might be different. ""If there's a bushfire, the moon might be bright red."" But there is more to Broome's sky show than its staircase to the moon. Yawuru singer-songwriter Steve Pigram said the constellations of Orion and Scorpio signified the changing of the seasons. ""The constellations signify the coming of winter, of Barrgana season, and that's also when the south-east starts to blow,"" he said. ""It signifies the coming of the blue nose salmon. ""They start to run and all the locals go out and catch them in the bay."" Mr Pigram said the staircase to the moon did not hold much significance when he was a child. ""It wasn't made a tourist attraction 'til the 70's or maybe 80's,"" he said. ""Sometimes, when you're in your hometown, you don't really know what you've got 'til someone else says, 'Hey, that's pretty good mate'.""

12,Winegrape growers worried for future as forecast shows 'disastrous' next season outlook,science," ABC Rural Growers may dump more grapes next season as wine glut grim forecast continues Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Winegrape growers are calling for government assistance with an oversupply of grapes that is sinking prices and leaving fruit unsold. The crisis in the global freight sector, along with China's decision to impose massive anti-dumping tariffs just as Australian growers produced a large crop in 2021 are behind the glut. The latest Wine Australia figures show exports were down 26 per cent year-on-year. This has been coupled with rising input costs, which have at least doubled in the past year due to increased disease-pressure and the cost of chemical, fertiliser, fuel and labour. Industry body Australian Grape and Wine said it expected difficult commercial conditions for the next three to five years. ""It’s a tough message to deliver, but we can’t afford to stick our heads in the sand,"" Australian Grape and Wine chief executive Tony Battaglene said. The situation is especially dire in South Australia's Riverland, where 80 per cent of the wine produced is exported. Riverland wine executive officer Lyndall Rowe said while interest from south-east Asian markets had been promising, it could not absorb the supply in the short term. ""It’s still positive because it’s a foundation step … but it will take time to grow.” Ms Rowe said the drop in demand had led many wineries to seek outside storage and build additional tanks. While the region finished harvesting grapes in early May, Riverland's CCW Co-operative chief executive Jim Godden said storage at most wineries was full by March. ""This meant the pace of vintage had to slow down into the swing of when space became available,"" he said. Mr Godden said he did not know how many members were out of contract but had received numerous calls from people trying to find a home for their grapes. The Riverland is home to more than 900 growers but some are choosing to get out of the game. Real estate agent Sam Hayes from Toop Toop Rural said a number of vineyards in the region have been listed recently. ""I think we'll see a generational shift in ownership of vineyards,"" he said. Mr Hayes said while the initial interest was from local buyers, the value for money could attract wider investment. “What is currently a liability could be an asset again very soon.” Recently, Australia's largest family-owned winery, Casella Family Brands, put 35 of their vineyards up for sale across New South Wales and South Australia. Colliers is handling the sale and national director of agribusiness Tim Altschwager said the offering was not related to the current oversupply issues. ""It's contrary to that. Casella is well known for selling into the US market. They've had a record sales year and haven't been affected by that overall,"" Mr Altschwager. In the Riverina, there are growing concerns that wineries could cap grape deliveries for next year, which could see the price of red grape varieties drop even further. Riverina Winegrape Growers president Jeremy Cass said the outlook for next season was ""disastrous"". ""The forecast coming from some of the wineries early, seems to be that they're full,"" Mr Cass said. Fourth-generation Griffith winegrape grower James Cremasco described the current situation as a losing battle, but said they would keep going, as the family always had. ""There is a lot of hardship, and there's generational farmers. I've got mates my own age, they're all talking about 'what are we doing this for?',"" Mr Cremasco said. ""The family's been doing it for so many years and I'd hate to see it go backwards, but at the end of the day dollars do count."" In the Murray Valley it is estimated that 20,000 tonnes of fruit were left unsold this season. Murray Valley Winegrowers executive officer Paul Derrico said anyone who had red grapes that were uncontracted had found it very difficult. ""They're really at the crossroads now as to whether they are going to continue on, and they are looking for any kind of financial assistance they can,"" he said. The grapes that haven't been sold to a winery still need to be harvested, otherwise it can have an impact on the vine and crop for the coming year. ""If we could get some form of assistance … given the heartbreak that growers have gone through over the past few months of not being able to sell their fruit,"" Mr Derrico said. A spokesperson for the Victorian agriculture minister acknowledged winegrape growers were being impacted by global demand and supply chain challenges as a result of the pandemic. ""We are working closely with growers and industry groups to support them to manage these impacts,"" the spokesperson said. Mr Derrico said his organisation had also requested support from the NSW government. ""At this stage it seems that the NSW government would probably not provide a direct financial assistance to help growers harvest their fruit, instead referring growers to the rural small business grants and rural assistance loans.” We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

13,Third time lucky for Starliner capsule trying to take mannequin to space station,science,"  Boeing's Starliner crew capsule set to dock with space station after successful launch Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Boeing's new Starliner crew capsule has rocketed into orbit on a test flight bound for the International Space Station. This latest mission comes after years of being grounded by flaws that could have doomed the spacecraft. Only a test dummy was aboard as the rocket launched. If the capsule reaches the International Space Station on Friday and everything else goes well, two or three NASA test pilots could strap in by the end of this year or early next for the company's first crewed flight. It is Boeing's third shot at the high-stakes flight. Starliner's first test flight in 2019 was stricken by software errors so severe that the capsule ended up in the wrong orbit and had to skip the space station. The spacecraft came close to being destroyed as ground controllers hastily cut short the mission. After dozens of safety fixes, Boeing returned a different capsule to the launch pad last summer. Corroded valves halted the countdown, resulting in another round of repairs. The drawn-out test flight program has cost Boeing approximately US$600 million (more than $851 million). ""We're not going to fly [crews] unless we feel like we've bought down the risk,"" NASA space operations chief Kathy Lueders stressed on the eve of lift-off. Boeing is seeking redemption as it attempts to catch up with SpaceX, NASA's other contracted taxi service. Elon Musk's company has been flying astronauts to and from the space station for two years and delivering cargo for a full decade. Eager to reduce its high-priced dependency on Russia for crew transport, NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to launch astronauts to the space station after the shuttle program ended in 2011. NASA administrator Bill Nelson said that was why it was so important for Boeing's Starliner to succeed. ""We always, in this case, want to have a backup,"" Mr Nelson said hours before lift-off. Starliner will spend close to a week at the space station before aiming for a touchdown in the New Mexico desert. US aerospace giant Boeing continues to face setbacks in its effort to launch that Starliner capsule, with the latest system glitch coming a week after an incident in which the International Space Station was briefly thrust out of control. Different in looks but similar in function to SpaceX's Dragon capsule, Boeing's fully automated capsule will attempt to dock at the space station on its own. However, station astronauts will be ready to steer the capsule by remote control if necessary. NASA has yet to finalise which astronauts will be in the first Starliner crew. The program is so far behind that the original three have stepped aside. The leading candidates gathered at Cape Canaveral for the evening launch of Starliner atop United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket. ""We're thrilled for this because the next one is us,"" astronaut Butch Wilmore said. Besides Rosie the Rocketeer — a space-age version of World War II's Rosie the Riveter — the capsule is carrying groceries and spacewalking gear for the seven station residents. US spacewalks have been on hold since an astronaut's helmet took on water in March. NASA is sending up extra absorbent pads for use in helmets, in case an emergency spacewalk is required as the investigation continues. Boeing also is flying mementos from historically black colleges and universities and tree seeds similar to those Apollo astronauts took to the Moon that became so-called Moon trees here on Earth.

14,Bystanders on Queensland beach help dwarf minke whale return to the ocean,science,"  Hervey Bay residents, local authorities hopeful they have saved the life of beached dwarf whale Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Hervey Bay residents and local authorities hope they have saved a whale that beached itself on the Fraser Coast this morning. The dwarf minke whale was spotted at sunrise and prompted a rapid response and rescue. ""He's safe for now, he's back out in the water,"" Fraser Coast mayor George Seymour said. ""We spent a few hours here. ""A large team from the Department of Parks and Wildlife, police, Hervey Bay surf lifesaving club, people from the whale watching industry rushed in to save the whale, which returned a couple of times after we got him out to sea."" As at 10am Friday morning, the whale was back in the ocean. ""He had superficial wounds and he didn't seem very alert, but he's got the best chance now he's back out in the water,"" the Mayor said. ""I'm really proud of the community, how it came together to rescue this whale."" Rangers and vet specialists say the whale appeared to be in good condition after being kept cool and calm with wet sheets, but could not say why it was stranded at Shelly Beach. Whale researcher Wally Franklin, from the Oceania Project, has studied whales in Hervey Bay for 30 years and said it was an unusual stranding. ""But it does occur. Over the years we've been involved in two minke strandings,"" Dr Franklin said. ""You're never sure exactly why they come ashore. ""They can come ashore if they are ill, they could be chased, or it may be a simple mistake."" Dr Franklin said it was inevitable more strandings would occur this season, especially for humpbacks. ""We can expect to see more with the east coast population somewhere in the order of 40,000 individual whales,"" he said. Dr Franklin said the first humpback sighting of the year had been early in May and the main flow of whales off the Fraser Coast would be from July to early November. ""That's what makes Hervey Bay the whale watch capital of the world and why it was accredited as the world's first whale heritage site,"" he said. Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service senior ranger Daniel Clifton said the 4.6 metre whale was doing well in deeper water. ""I've just come back after being on the boat following the animal for a couple of hours and in the end we lost sight of it, which is a good sign,"" he said. ""It seemed to be swimming reasonably normally and it wasn't very stressed."" The department has encouraged anyone who spots a stranded whale, alive or dead, to call 1300 130 372.

15,Researchers say coal-to-hydrogen project's lower emissions claims 'misleading',science,"  Australia Institute disputes Victorian coal-to-hydrogen emissions claims Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog New research has found a project using Victorian brown coal to make hydrogen is unlikely to meet its claimed emission reductions. The Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project aims to test if it is possible to produce hydrogen from coal for export. The first shipment of liquefied hydrogen created from coal mined at the Loy Yang brown coal mine in the Latrobe Valley was shipped to Japan this year. A consortium of Japanese and Australian companies, including Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Japanese energy giant J-Power and AGL, which owns Loy Yang, are behind the pilot. But to reach commercialisation stage the consortium will rely on carbon capture storage to lower emissions and make it carbon neutral. The consortium plans to use the Victorian government's Carbon Net, which is still in development phase. The federal and Victorian governments have provided more than $50 million toward the supply chain pilot. Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor and the consortium said the project would reduce emissions by 1.8 million tonnes a year if it reached commercialisation. They said that would be equivalent of emissions from 350,000 petrol cars. Independent public policy think tank the Australia Institute says it has obtained freedom of information documents that reveal this emission claim is misleading as it compared the project with other hydrogen gas projects, which didn't use carbon capture storage. Australia Institute emerging climate and energy program director Richie Merzian said the supply chain project would add between 2.9 and 3.8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions if it was compared with renewable hydrogen production, without carbon capture storage. He said that was equivalent to adding 550,000 to 735,000 petrol cars to the road. ""Those numbers make incorrect comparisons (so) it seems like this project will reduce emissions when we know it will actually increase,"" he said. ""You should be comparing it to a zero-emission hydrogen alternative,"" he said. However a spokesperson for the Coalition government said the coal hydrogen emission reduction estimate, including carbon capture storage technology, was reached using figures from the International Energy Agency and the CSIRO. ""Both the International Energy Agency and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have recognised carbon capture and storage technologies as being crucial to meeting global emissions reduction targets,"" the Coalition campaign headquarters spokesman said. Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain consortium spokesman Jeremy Stone said the Australia Institute's analysis was ""factually incorrect"" because they were assuming carbon capture storage would not be part of the project. ""Our calculations on carbon reductions ... is about what will happen when Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain proceeds with carbon capture and storage,"" he said. ""We have now produced pure hydrogen through gasification of a mix of biomass and coal, providing us with the potential of commercially producing carbon neutral and maybe carbon negative hydrogen (when combined with carbon capture storage)."" Mr Merzian said the supply chain trial should not be labelled as ""clean hydrogen"" because carbon capture storage had been a ""colossal failure"". Carbon capture storage involves capturing carbon dioxide at the site of production then pumping it deep underground where it can migrate into porous substrate, such as sandstone, and be trapped. ""The reason why we still talk about carbon capture and storage is because fossil fuel companies wanted it as a marketing tool to pretend they can clean up their act and continue to expand their footprint,"" Mr Merzian said. The Coalition government spokesperson said there were 29 commercial carbon capture storage facilities operating globally and more than 100 projects were in various stages of development. Esso Australia, which has oil and gas operations off Victoria's coast, was recently given about $40 million in federal government grants for its South East Australia Carbon Capture and Storage Hubs project. Esso was contacted for comment. ""The only way we'll get these technologies to maturity is by making sensible investments in their development and deployment,"" the Coalition spokesperson said. The Australia Institute also released polling revealing many people were confused by the term ""clean hydrogen"". Only one fifth the 1007 people polled knew its correct definition, which was set by the federal government and used hydrogen made using fossil fuels and carbon capture storage or with renewable energy. The polling showed 42 per cent in the survey thought ""clean hydrogen"" was limited to hydrogen using renewables, a zero emissions process. ""The polling shows that people don't know what clean hydrogen is, (so we) need to ditch that term and just call things as they are,"" Mr Merzian said.

16,New 3D mapping reveals the hidden 47-year-old tragedy commuters pass every day,science,"  SS Lake Illawarra mapped in 3D as government prepares to upgrade Tasman Bridge Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog While many Tasmanians have heard the story, some people may not realise an important piece of history is lying next to the Tasman Bridge as they travel between Hobart's eastern and western shores. The SS Lake Illawarra sits at the bottom of the River Derwent after it crashed into several pylons of the bridge on Sunday 5 January, 1975, killing 12 people. While the 140 metre-long bulk carrier is popular among divers, it is hard for most of us to imagine what the wreck of the Lake Illawarra looks like. That is, until now. Almost 50 years on, CSIRO and Jacobs Engineering group have produced the first complete 3D model of the wreck, bridge, riverbed and shoreline. ""It provides a much more detailed and accurate depiction of what's on the seabed, and obviously the wreck and the piers themselves,"" Jacobs survey technical director Paul Digney said. It took four days to complete the project, using a multi beam echo sounder and a terrestrial laser scanner to map features above and below the waterline. ""We [CSIRO and Jacobs] have been able to improve on the resolution of the data so you can see more detail of the wreck,"" CSIRO hydrographic surveyor Craig Davey said. ""Now we have a full sea bed, and bridge data set, which is interesting"". The new mapping also gives a clearer idea of the wreck's exact position, revealing the ship's bow sits next to the third pylon on the eastern shore side of the bridge, and the ship points at a 45-degree angle towards the middle of the river. The wreck lies 125 metres offshore in about 35 metres of water, and at its highest point is about 15 metres below the waterline. The new data has been offered up to the state government as it prepares to undergo its first major upgrade of the Tasman Bridge since it was repaired in 1975. ""We've notified the Department of State Growth that this data is available and we are optimistic that it will be of some value. it certainly provides a much clearer picture of anything they've had in the past"", Mr Digney said. The new high-resolution map of the Lake Illawarra wreck also opens up the possibility of comparing the data to a 2014 survey, to monitor any deterioration of the wreck and to assess whether it has moved during that period. ""The wreck doesn't pose a risk to the bridge, but without the ability to measure that, there's always a concern that there might be something going on that isn't considered,"" Mr Digney said. A maritime archaeologist said the state had a fascinating history, with more than 1,000 shipwrecks in Tasmanian waters. ""It's not uncommon for a shipwreck to be so close to a city, because they were a major point of contact between maritime and land-based transport,"" said Emily Jateff, from the Australian National Maritime Museum. ""Most shipwrecks are a result of an accident, and they capture the world at that exact moment in time."" While all shipwrecks are an important piece of our history, many have a connection to the Lake Illawarra story. ""There's a lot of interest in not only the tragedy of the wreck but the social impact,"" said John Wadsley from the Maritime Museum of Tasmania. ""Hobart was literally cut in two and it caused such a great degree of change in the way the city operated."" Maritime experts hope the stunning images give people a new appreciation of what happened to the Lake Illawarra and how the Tasman Bridge disaster shaped the city of Hobart. ""The eastern shore became a lot more developed ... it completely transformed transport patterns in Hobart,"" Mr Wadsley said. Now work is underway to find more of these sunken vessels, which capture important moments in history. ""One of the things we're doing now is working with CSIRO and they are using their advanced surveying equipment on board to look for shipwrecks while they're doing other scientific research so that's a real help,"" Ms Jateff said. ""But some wrecks are gravesites … so maybe you don't want to find them at all.""

17,Jo raised her home 4m off the ground — it still flooded. Insiders say she's a victim of Australia's 'worthless' climate predictions,science,"  Climate change has made old measures predicting weather events in Australia 'essentially worthless' Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Jo Groves bought her property in Lismore, she worked hard to make it her own and thought she would grow old in it. Now, she's unsure when she'll be able to return and, even then, she's apprehensive about it. ""I have to come back in the short term,"" she said. ""But in the longer term, I'll get out as soon as I can."" Ms Groves is one of many Australians on the east coast — and in Lismore in particular — who have been displaced after two years of record rainfall and widespread flooding. When she bought her home in late 2016 she knew flooding was a risk. ""But I'm a low income earner and my choices were limited in terms of affordable housing in Lismore,"" she said. In 2017, just months after she finished renovating and moved in, Lismore was hit with its worst floods in 40 years. A foot of water gushed through her newly renovated home. After the flooding event, Jo did everything she could to make her home flood safe. With the help of a government grant, she even elevated her home four metres off the ground. She said it was as high as was legally allowed, and it put her floor 80cm above what was known as Lismore's crucial ""one in 100 year flood"" level. It is a marker used by state governments and local councils around the country to determine ""flood planning levels"" — the level above which new houses must be built. ""I believed that raising the house would make it flood safe,"" Ms Groves said. But in February this year, another unprecedented flood swept through the town. Ms Groves ended up with 1.25m of water through her home — a flood more than two metres above the one-in-100-year-flood level. Around Australia, statistical measures like the ""one-in-100-year flood"" level are used by authorities to determine safe building standards, allocate rescue resources and determine emergency response plans. Homes in bushfire prone areas are built to withstand certain fires, based on the ""accumulated fire danger index"" for the area. Likewise, homes in cyclone-prone areas are built to withstand the category of cyclone expected for the area. The thing most of these measures have in common is that they're based on the historical record. David Karoly, one of Australia's leading climate scientists, said the impact of climate change meant these measures were now ""essentially worthless"". ""Information about climate extremes has in the past been based on datasets and available observations up to about the 1980s and 1990s,"" he said. ""But information about the past is not a good guide to what's going to happen now, in the 2030s, the 2050s, and later."" Greg Mullins is a former commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW and has been a firefighter for about 50 years. He said climate change meant these days he was ""flying blind"". ""Throughout my firefighting career, we pretty well knew what the risks were; what to expect in a bushfire season,"" he said. ""That started to change from the late '90s. Now, we really have no idea."" This summer's flooding was not the first time concerns have been raised about Australia's preparedness for climate change impacts. Or, as Greg Mullins puts it: ""taking the blindfold off our emergency responders"". Figuring out how frequent extreme weather events were likely to be in a hotter climate was a recommendation of the royal commission that followed the black summer bushfires of 2019-2020. It recommended the Commonwealth work with the state and territory governments to develop what are called ""downscaled climate projections"". The projections take the global climate models and run them at much higher resolution, producing projections about how frequent and likely devastating fire weather, extreme rainfall and other extreme weather phenomena will be. Greg Mullins, who is also a former head of the group Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, said this sort of work was essential for emergency managers, planning authorities and the general public. In the case of Australia's action — or inaction — on climate change, the science has something to say. ""The royal commission overtly said that [in the future] we need to work on the basis of data that is currently outside the realms of expectation and reduce that lack of knowledge,"" he says. ""These days we fly blind on the worst days because we've never had conditions like 2019 or early 2020."" David Karoly agreed. ""What we need — [and ] it's what we needed five years ago — is new climate change projections for Australia based on the most recent global and regional climate change information,"" he said. To produce those regional and local projections — the downscaled climate projections — the Australian government would need to invest in the order of $100 million to run climate models at very high resolution on supercomputers, according to Professor Karoly. Robert Glasser is the head of the Climate and Science Policy Centre, within the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Previously, he was the UN's Secretary General's Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction. Dr Glasser said getting up to date information about natural disasters and climate change would save lives. ""It's important to understand these things,"" he said. ""Because if we want to prepare for them — if we want to be sure that when these events happen, that we're able to survive, and ideally thrive as opposed to suffer destruction, loss of life, economic losses — then we have to understand how often they happen."" Last year, the federal government set aside $210 million to create the Australian Climate Service (ACS), set up, in part, to satisfy the need for regional and local climate projections in Australia. According to the government's website, the service is designed to bring together expertise and information to help local communities build resilience to climate change. The ACS came about following the Bushfire Royal Commission's recommendation for downscaled projections, which the commission said should be done in collaboration with the federal, state and territory governments. Instead, the ACS is answerable to two federal agencies, both of which report to the Commonwealth's Department of Home Affairs -- a move Mr Mullins said was ""quite bizarre"", since it is the states and territories that are responsible for almost all emergency response and preparation. ""During the bushfires. Scott Morrison justified his trip to Hawaii at the height of the fires by saying it's a state territory responsibility, 'not my job',""  Mr Mullins said. ""Well, my job's to try and work out what's happening with these fires, and if I don't have the data — if that's held in a government department that's not responsible for doing that — what good is it?"" Climate change is being buried this election. So we asked some of Australia's leading climate scientists for their verdict on how the major parties' policies stack up. David Karoly's work at the CSIRO was used by the bushfire royal commission to help formulate its recommendation. In his former roles, he worked closely with those involved in the ACS, until he retired this year. He believed the big investment needed to produce valuable projections was being siphoned away to other projects. ""Unfortunately, the funding for regional climate projections appears to have been very substantially cut and what had been planned as an $80 million new generation climate projections for Australia appears to have been significantly reallocated to other activities within the Australian Climate Service,"" he says. ""It appears now that there's only going to be $40 million, which is still a significant funding, but will not be adequate."" The IPCC says climate change is now a threat to human wellbeing, warning the window we have to act is ""rapidly closing"". The ABC asked the Australian Climate Service  (ACS) how much money was being spent on implementing the Bushfire Royal Commission's recommendation for downscaled climate projections, but didn't receive a specific answer. A spokeswoman for the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the ACS was playing a ""key role"" in producing the downscaled climate projections called for by the Royal Commission. ""The projections will enable assessments of future natural disaster risks and will inform a national risk assessment,"" the spokeswoman said. The ABC also asked the Morrison government about the alleged cut to spending on local and regional climate projections but didn't receive an answer. In a written statement, a Morrison government spokesperson said the investment in the ACS strengthens Australia's leadership in anticipating the impacts of climate change. They also said the investment was part of a wider set of investments helping Australia respond to extreme weather events. The spokesperson said: ""Data collection and sharing cannot be done by the Commonwealth alone. As the royal commission found, it is critical that states and territories also participate in the collection and sharing of data to inform better decision making in times of natural disaster."" The spokesperson said National Cabinet had already agreed that all Australian and all state and territory governments would work together to share data and disaster risk information. But the government couldn't clarify when and how that data would be shared. A spokesperson for the environment department said it was preparing a Climate Projections Roadmap for Australia, which would ""ensure the projections community meet the needs of a growing number of users of climate information and services"". In 2014, the Productivity Commission — which gives independent research and advice to the government — estimated that about 97 per cent of disaster funding went into cleaning up after events,and only three per cent goes into mitigating the impacts before they occur. ""I think that distribution is a recipe for disaster,"" Dr Glasser said. ""With climate change increasing the pace of these extreme hazard events, if all we do is spend [the] lion's share of our money responding after they strike, we're never going to get ahead of this."" He said improved climate projections were an important investment, which would lower the cost of disasters when they occurred. ""Disasters are happening frequently now,"" he said. ""The resilience of communities is eroding because how many times can you rebuild your business and the costs? The price tag is just skyrocketing for the government as well.""

18,Dusty demise for NASA Mars lander as power dwindles,science,"  NASA's Mars lander set for dusty demise as power dwindles Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A NASA spacecraft on Mars is headed for a dusty demise. The InSight lander is losing power because of all the dust on its solar panels, NASA said on Tuesday. NASA said it will keep using the spacecraft's seismometer to register marsquakes until the power peters out, likely in July. Then flight controllers will monitor InSight until the end of this year, before calling everything off. ""There really hasn't been too much doom and gloom on the team. We're really still focused on operating the spacecraft,"" said Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Bruce Banerdt, the principal scientist. Since landing on Mars in 2018, InSight has detected more than 1,300 marsquakes: the biggest one, a magnitude 5, occurred two weeks ago. NASA's InSight lander has revealed what Mars looks like inside, and it's very different to Earth. It will be NASA's second Mars lander lost to dust: A global dust storm took out Opportunity in 2018. In InSight's case, it's been a gradual gathering of dust, especially over the past year. NASA's two other functioning spacecraft on the Martian surface — rovers Curiosity and Perseverance — are still going strong thanks to nuclear power. The space agency may rethink solar power in the future for Mars, said planetary science director Lori Glaze, or at least experiment with new panel-clearing tech or aim for the less-stormy seasons. InSight currently is generating one-tenth of the power from the sun that it did upon arrival. Deputy project manager Kathya Zamora Garcia said the lander initially had enough power to run an electric oven for 1 hour and 40 minutes: it is now down to 10 minutes max. The InSight team anticipated this much dust build-up, but hoped a gust of wind or dust devil might clean off the solar panels. That has yet to happen, despite several thousand whirlwinds coming close. ""None of them have quite hit us dead-on yet enough to blow the dust off the panels,"" Dr Banerdt told reporters. Another science instrument, dubbed the mole, was supposed to burrow five metres underground to measure the internal temperature of Mars. But the German digger never got deeper than half a metre because of the unexpected composition of the red dirt, and it finally was declared dead at the beginning of last year.

19,'Great big metallic bang' accompanies spectacular 'fireball' caught on camera over WA,science,"  'Fireball' lights up sky over southern WA as meteor makes spectacular entry into Earth's atmosphere Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A ""fireball"" startled residents across southern Western Australia when it lit up the sky on Wednesday morning. People from as far apart as Corrigin, Nannup, Albany, Newdegate and Esperance reported a bright flash and loud explosive sounds just after 5am. The meteor was caught on video by Perth Observatory and by private surveillance cameras. Simon told ABC Radio he was driving between Nannup and Bridgetown at about 5:15 this morning when he noticed a ""green ball"" that he thought was lightning. He said the display lasted about five seconds. ""As it came closer it just disintegrated,"" Simon said. ""I was freaking out a bit."" Steve was driving in the lower Great Southern when he saw something similar. ""I saw a greeny-blue light up the whole sky."" ""Definitely not lightning."" Elizabeth in Albany said the sound was like two trucks colliding. ""It was a great big metallic bang,"" she said. Curtin University researcher and member of the Desert Fireball network Hadrien Devillepoix, said similar sightings happened across Australia ""hundreds"" of times a year. He said the network's cameras in the lower Great Southern did not detect an explosion, but a report was made to the International Meteor Organisation's crowd-sourced website. One contributor, Sharon, reported a sighting at 5.25am this morning at Redmond West, just outside Albany. Mr Devillepoix said meteors burned up quickly when they hit the atmosphere. He said they travelled at 10 to 20 kilometres per second. ""Rocks tend to get destroyed,"" Mr Devillepoix said.

20,How your local garbage truck is helping fix south-east Queensland's pothole problems with AI,science,"  How your local garbage truck is helping fix south-east Queensland's pothole problems Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Garbage trucks and artificial intelligence are being used to tackle south-east Queensland's mammoth pothole problem, following weeks of floods and heavy rain. Moreton Bay Regional Council, north of Brisbane, has been using cameras on garbage trucks to track potholes and report them back for repair. Mayor Peter Flannery said the system was working well, with the region's roads being repaired faster after the recent floods. ""There's potholes all across our region at the moment … it's not due to lack of maintenance, it's just the weather we've had, the amount of rain we've had,"" he said. ""Water doesn't work good with roads once it gets in there and flushes out the asphalt and a pothole appears pretty quick."" Footage from the garbage truck cameras, which are fitted to monitor road conditions, is scoured by artificial intelligence to identify potholes, road cracks or damage. The data is sent on to the council's asset management team to create a job order, and workers sent out to fix the problem quickly. The system was expected to be in use by nearly 30 Moreton Bay garbage trucks by the end of last year. ""It's a great way of using a truck that's going up and down streets every day of the week rather than rely on our residents to put in a complaint or for someone to have a nasty accident,"" Mr Flannery said. ""It's amazing, in the February [flood] event many people contacted me saying they were surprised how quick council was getting out there and fixing the potholes after the rain had stopped, and I'm sure that will happen again this time."" The council also relies on residents reporting potholes to track down any issues. Further south, Brisbane City Council repaired more than 17,000 potholes across March, which Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said was more than double the usual monthly pothole problem. ""Whether it's through our call centre or via our text message service, Brisbane residents have been a massive help in fixing potholes,"" he said. ""I urge everyone to stay vigilant when driving and to keep reporting them as soon as they appear so we can get a crew to the site as soon as possible."" Residents can call Brisbane City Council's contact centre on 07 3403 8888 to report potholes.

21,US Congress holds first hearing on UFOs in decades,science,"  US Congress holds first hearing on UFOs in decades, Pentagon official shows video from F-18 'UAP' encounter Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The US Congress has held its first hearing in half a century on unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and no, there is still no government confirmation of extraterrestrial life. Testifying before a House Intelligence subcommittee on Tuesday, Pentagon officials did not disclose additional information from their ongoing investigation of hundreds of unexplained sightings in the sky. But they said they had picked a director for a new task force to coordinate data collection efforts on UFOs, or as the government prefers to label them, ""unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs)"". Ronald Moultrie, the undersecretary of defence for intelligence, said the Pentagon was also trying to destigmatise the issue and encourage pilots and other military personnel to report anything unusual they see. ""We want to know what's out there as much as you want to know what's out there,"" Mr Moultrie told politicians, adding that he was a fan of science fiction himself. ""We get the questions not just from you. We get it from family and we get them night and day."" Politicians from both parties say UFOs are a national security concern. Sightings of what appear to be aircraft flying without discernible means of propulsion have been reported near military bases and coastlines, raising the prospect that witnesses have spotted undiscovered or secret Chinese or Russian technology. But the sightings are usually fleeting. Some appear for no more than an instant on camera — and then sometimes end up distorted by the camera lens. The US government is believed to hold additional technical information on the sightings that it has not disclosed publicly. An interim report released by intelligence officials last year counted 144 sightings of aircraft or other devices apparently flying at mysterious speeds or trajectories. In all but one of the sightings investigated, there was too little information for investigators to even broadly characterise the nature of the incident. A major US government report on UFOs says defence and intelligence analysts lack sufficient data to determine the nature of mysterious flying objects observed by military pilots. A top Pentagon official on Tuesday briefly demonstrated the challenge. Scott Bray, deputy director of naval intelligence, stood next to a television to show a short video taken from an F-18 military plane. The video shows a blue sky with passing clouds. In a single frame — which it took several minutes for staff in the room to queue up — there is an image of one balloon-like shape. ""As you can see, finding UAP is harder than you may think,"" Mr Bray said. Congressman André Carson, an Indiana Democrat who chaired the hearing, called on investigators to show they ""are willing to follow the facts where they lead"". Congressman Rick Crawford, an Arkansas Republican, noted that the investigations were not ""about finding alien spacecraft but about delivering dominant intelligence"". ""The inability to understand objects in our sensitive operating areas is tantamount to intelligence failure that we certainly want to avoid,"" he said.

22,Invention that signals 'we shouldn't be playing this late' saves community's basketball ring,science,"  Coburg basketball ring gets innovative upgrade after night noise complaints Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A public basketball hoop in Melbourne's north has been saved by the innovative thinking of a council worker and two industrial design students. The hoop in Coburg's Bush Reserve was removed after police and council received several complaints about the noise of late-night basketballers disrupting residents between 10pm and 2am. ""We want young people to have a good time, but to do it in a way that is a bit more respectful of those living nearby,"" Moreland City Council Mayor Mark Riley said. ""There are other sites where they can go that aren't so close to residents."" After verbal warnings were not enough to keep the late-night noise at bay the hoop was removed in July 2021. Determined to find a way to reinstall the ring, a council worker investigated what existing technology was available to automatically remove the hoop at night and return it during daylight hours. When he couldn't find any workable solutions on the market, he approached a number of Melbourne universities seeking a solution. Monash University industrial design students Marcell Aryananda and Jules Kabore were told about the brief and took up the design challenge. After researching various possible solutions and the cost, the pair came up with a relatively simple and inexpensive design. ""It's essentially a pole that extends out at certain times in the middle of the hoop to stop the ball going through,"" Mr Kabore said. ""But it is also a social cue that we shouldn't be playing this late."" The pole is connected to a circuit board which is programmed to extend the pole at 10pm and retract it at 8am. Mr Aryananda said it was powered by a battery and a solar panel. ""We have an internal clock to support that circuit board, so it knows what time it is,"" he said. The device was installed in early April and has performed well so far. All up the materials cost $1,200. ""I am relieved that it is working,"" Mr Aryananda said. ""The project has been really fulfilling honestly."" Mr Riley says it is a ""win-win"" for everybody. ""The local residents are really pleased with it, but the young ones kind of get it as well,"" he said. Moreland City Council is keen to try out refined versions of the invention at two other sites within the municipality. ""I was really impressed by the students' thinking,"" Mr Riley said. For Mr Aryananda and Mr Kabore, it was also a great opportunity to kickstart their careers. ""As young designers it's quite difficult to enter into the field,"" Mr Kabore said. ""The fact they were willing to help us in every regard and sponsor us through this has been great. ""We are not offered these opportunities very often.""

23,"Being told to reduce your stress can feel 'disempowering', says this expert. She has some better suggestions",science,"  Stress is difficult to escape in modern life. Experts say we should change our approach Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Adam lost control of the muscles in the left-hand side of his face thanks to Bell's palsy, he was told that stress may have made him more susceptible to the condition. ""That was a big signal to me to pay a little bit more attention to my stress levels,"" he tells ABC RN's This Working Life. But as an employee in the professional services industry with a never-ending to-do list and several long-term projects on the go, Adam wasn't sure where to start. He's not alone. This Working Life looks at how (and why) we work, exploring workplace practices to culture and leadership. In 2015, the Australian Psychological Society's Stress and Wellbeing in Australia survey revealed 35 per cent of Australians reported a significant level of distress. More recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the COVID-19 pandemic has made the world an inherently more stressful place to exist, with social isolation, loneliness, fear of infection and death, and financial worries leading to unprecedented stress levels globally. Unfortunately, it seems stress is difficult to escape. So is trying to reduce it the best option? Or should we be learning to address stress in a different way? Alison Earl is an author and trainer in mindset and resilience. She says, rather than trying to stress less, it's time we changed the way we think about it. ""Trying to eliminate stress and reduce it is actually really unrealistic when you break down how we live our lives."" Ms Earl has experienced what she calls ""the dark side"" of stress. Six years ago, she was living in New York, working around the clock and running on adrenaline. Then she was diagnosed with proctitis, an inflammatory condition of the lower digestive system. ""I was told it would never go away,"" she says. ""The doctor said I needed to learn how to manage it, and the biggest thing I should do is reduce my stress."" Ms Earl says this advice wasn't very helpful. ""The message that the only way to manage stress is to reduce it is one of the most disempowering messages out there,"" she says. She had a more positive relationship with stress in the past. As a young athlete, she'd used it to her advantage. ""Stress or pressure to perform was always something I really relished,"" she says. So, in the face of her chronic health diagnosis, Ms Earl decided to harness a different way of thinking about her stress. ""I re-engaged with the athlete mentality of how stress is useful and helpful,"" she says. She says this mindset shift — of seeing stress as a positive — had a dramatic effect on her health and her life. ""My symptoms cleared up completely and I haven't experienced any in six years."" Dr Kari Leibowitz, a health psychologist from Stanford University who has conducted research into how changing your approach can improve your health and wellbeing, says mindset can be incredibly powerful. ""It creates this self-fulfilling prophecy,"" she says. In essence, if you start thinking stress is good for you, it starts being good for you. ""People have fewer sick days, they perform better at work and have greater life satisfaction,"" Dr Leibowitz says. She highlights the work of mindset expert Dr Alia Crum, who is the principal investigator at the Stanford Mind and Body Lab. Dr Crum's research suggests there are both psychological and physiological benefits to changing your mindset. In a 2007 study, the researcher asked a group of hotel room attendants how much exercise they got in a week. ""Two thirds of them said that they didn't exercise regularly and one third said they got no exercise at all,"" Dr Leibowitz says. ""But if you think about it, hotel room attendants get a lot of exercise. ""They're on their feet all day, they're changing bed linens, they're scrubbing bathtubs, they're moving all day long."" So Dr Crum told half the attendants their work meant they were exercising and the amount they were doing exceeded the general recommendations for adults. ""Four weeks later, those room attendants not only liked their jobs more, but they also reported significant weight loss and had reduced blood pressure,"" Dr Leibowitz says. Get a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by subscribing to our monthly newsletter Ms Earl says although many people accept that stress can help performance, they find it difficult to believe it's good for you. But changing the way we think about stress has a knock-on effect in the rest of the body, she says. ""It's not just about feeling better about it, research shows we also release different hormones in our body,"" Ms Earl says. ""So our body has a different physiological response to make it less harmful and more helpful."" Dr Leibowitz says one of the ways to help understand how stress can be good for you is to realise it can be a marker for the things we really care about. ""The most rewarding, fulfilling, meaningful parts of our lives are also the parts where we've experienced stress,"" she says, such as family and work. But she acknowledges this can sometimes be hard to realise in the moment, particularly because of the physiological sensations we experience. ""[When we're feeling stressed], our body is trying to prepare us for what it thinks is an emergency,"" she says. In these instances, Dr Leibowitz says it can be helpful to reframe your stress. ""There's a study showing that if you can get kids who are taking [exams] to reframe their stress as excitement, it helps them perform better."" She says it's worth observing your physical experience of stress, such as a faster heart rate and sweaty palms, and telling yourself you're excited – even if you're not. ""This can be a 'fake it 'til you make it' moment."" But Dr Leibowitz says sometimes pretending isn't possible. ""Sometimes you're not thriving, you're not living your best life."" She believes many of us have understandably felt that way due to the pandemic. There's no doubt stress can be debilitating. Burn-out was listed in the WHO's 2019 revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as an occupational phenomenon. It was defined as the result of chronic workplace stress that hasn't been successfully managed. Dr Leibowitz says the focus of stress management needs to shift. ""So much of it is on reducing stress only, and not on building up other things that bring us joy and feed into our positive emotions,"" she says. Ms Earl agrees, suggesting a two-minute energy-boosting activity five times a day — such as a breathing exercise, listening to a song or watching a funny video — can transform how you feel. This can be particularly hard to do when we're feeling stressed. ""When we're in scarcity mode and feel like there aren't enough hours in the day, our brain is telling us that any time we spend away will result in a loss of productivity or the bottom line,"" says Dr Leibowitz. But she says your brain's got it all wrong. ""So much of the research shows that taking breaks makes us more creative and efficient and that fuelling our bodies helps us perform."" ""So, for a week, do an experiment where every hour you force yourself to go and move around a little bit, and drink a glass of water and step outside for two minutes and breathe in the fresh air."" ""At the end of the week, ask yourself a) how do you feel and b) how much less have you gotten done?"" Get more stories that go beyond the news cycle with our weekly newsletter.

24,"This tooth lay in a Laos cave for 150,000 years. It belonged to a young girl, but she wasn't Homo sapiens",science," Science Ancient human tooth discovered in Laos cave may be first Denisovan fossil from South-East Asia Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A single ancient tooth found in a Laos cave may be the first physical evidence of an extinct, enigmatic group of humans called Denisovans in South-East Asia. The molar is unveiled in a study published in Nature Communications today by an international team, which concluded it once belonged to a young girl who lived as far back as 164,000 years ago. And if added to the Denisovan catalogue, this would be just the third site in the world for such fossils — and one that's thousands of kilometres south of the others. ""When it was found, I wasn't surprised, but I was definitely excited,"" said study co-author Kira Westaway, a geochronologist at Macquarie University. Traces of dalliances with Denisovans have been found in the genome of present-day populations, particularly in people indigenous to Australia, Papua New Guinea and some Pacific Islands, and, to a lesser extent, mainland South-East Asia. ""So we knew that there was some intermixing, some integration, in this area,"" Dr Westaway said. Yet despite this, scarcely any Denisovan fossils have been identified — not just in South-East Asia, but anywhere full stop. So far, there's a pinky finger bone and a few teeth from Denisova Cave in Russia, plus a jaw bone and a few teeth from Baishiya Cave on the Tibetan Plateau. A bone from a child with a Neanderthal mother and Denisovan father was recently reported too. The Laos tooth — found in the tropics — showed how adaptable these ancient humans were, Dr Westaway said. ""If you look at the time range [of the Laos tooth], Denisovans were freezing their arses off in Russia, they were adapting to high altitudes in Tibet, and they were living in balmy tropical caves of Laos all at the same time, but doing it 100,000 years earlier than modern humans were doing it."" So who did the molar — the first or second tooth from the back of a lower left jaw — belong to? Archaeologists were clued in on the age of the tooth's owner by its pristineness. It was an adult or permanent tooth, but had no signs of wear and tear, suggesting it hadn't yet grown through the gum and into the mouth when its owner died. In the absence of usable DNA — the heat and humidity of the tropics degrades genetic material quickly — they analysed more robust proteins in the tooth enamel to ascertain if it belonged to a boy or girl. Males produce a particular form of a protein that's involved in enamel production. The molar did not contain that protein type. This all pointed to a girl, who was between 3.5 and 8.5 years old when she died. Now — what type of human was she? Our species Homo sapiens might be the only type of human knocking around the planet today, but we know quite a few branches of our family tree have, at some point (or points), called South-East Asia home. Carved teeth, tools, bones, DNA and sediments show Neanderthals may have shared a shelter with the enigmatic Denisovans for thousands of years. The team compared lumps and bumps on the tooth's surface and under the enamel with other teeth of a range of different humans — including Neanderthals, Homo erectus, Denisovans and Homo sapiens — to rule them out (or in). For instance, the chewing surface of the tooth was exceptionally crinkled, so much so it couldn't be H. sapiens, which has a smoother surface. Teeth previously discovered in Denisova Cave helped in the identification process, said study co-author Renaud Joannes-Boyau, a geochemist at Southern Cross University. But overall, the tooth looked remarkably similar to its counterpart attached to what many believe is a Denisovan jawbone found in a cave in Tibet. There were also some similarities to Neanderthal teeth, Dr Joannes-Boyau said, but that was expected. ""We know Denisovans were very, very close to Neanderthals, and we actually believe that Denisovans were once probably a geographically [isolated population] of Neanderthals, but it's not really clear yet."" The researchers also needed to get a handle on the tooth's age. Directly dating the tooth could be possible, but that technique would involve cutting into it, so the team decided to leave it whole and date everything around the precious fossil instead. The tooth was found buried in hard sediments in Tam Ngu Hao 2, or Cobra Cave, up in the Annamite mountains of Laos. The area is a warren of limestone caves, some of which are famous for ancient human fossilised remains. For instance, the nearby Tam Pa Ling, or Cave of the Monkeys, yielded evidence of modern human habitation some 60,000 years ago. Flinders University geoarchaeologist and study co-author Mike Morley was working at Cave of the Monkeys when the entrance to Cobra Cave, some 30 metres up a rocky hillside, was found. He climbed up to have a look. Tam Ngu Hao 2 was not a spacious cavern, and probably not a place humans would have lived, he said. ""It has a rounded part of the top, but then it's narrower at the bottom ... like a keyhole. ""I didn't have to wriggle into it, but it was small enough that only one person could get in at any one time."" But Tam Ngu Hao 2 was part of a larger network of chambers and tunnels. Bones, teeth and other bits and bobs were washed from the surface into the cave and covered in silt and sand. It was in this jumbled mix that the tooth was later found. Dr Morley analysed sections of the sediment to make sure it hadn't been ""reworked"", which can mix newer fossils and sediments with older stuff. Dr Joannes-Boyau directly dated a few herbivore teeth from the same thick sediment layer the tooth was found in, while Dr Westaway calculated how long ago the sediment itself was buried. Yet more team members dated the cave's flowstone — a hard, mineralised sheet atop the fossil layer that built up as mineral-rich water dribbled into the cave and deposited crystals as it evaporated. Together, they suggest the girl lived and died towards the end of the Middle Pleistocene, some 164–131,000 years ago. Andy Herries, an archaeologist at La Trobe University who was not involved with the study, said the researchers had ""done everything they possibly could to get the best information out of [the tooth] in terms of its age and its morphology"". One sticking point, he added, may be attributing the tooth to a Denisovan based heavily on its similarity to the Tibetan plateau jawbone. There's still some controversy over whether it is Denisovan or not. But, Professor Herries said, it makes sense that the Laos tooth is indeed Denisovan, based on present-day genetic studies of people living in the region. What will help cement the tooth's Denisovan status is finding more fossils like it. ""We've got massive amounts of data for Homo erectus, and massive amounts of data for Neanderthals, and massive amounts of data for Homo sapiens. ""The sample size for Denisovan teeth is the ones from the Tibetan mandible and the ones from Denisova Cave. That's it. ""The amount of data that we have for Denisovans is tiny."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Griffith University archaeologist Adam Brumm, who was not involved in the study either, agreed that the tooth was likely Denisovan. ""Denisovans were clearly established in parts of eastern Asia and genetic analysis also suggests they might have lived in South-East Asia too; in fact, some evidence places them as far east of Laos as New Guinea."" He cautioned that it's ""always dangerous to draw big conclusions from a solitary find"" like a tooth, but ""hominin fossils are so rare that every new specimen is important"", especially in South-East Asia. And the discovery of Homo floresiensis, also known as The Hobbit, also started with a single tooth. It was only years later that more of its skeleton came to light. ""This [study] is more of a 'watch this space' find than a Eureka moment,"" Professor Brumm said. ""One thing is for sure: the South-East Asian fossil record has yielded all sorts of amazing surprises in recent decades, so who knows what else this team might unearth at the site?""

25,Elon Musk says Twitter deal 'cannot move forward' without proof of fake accounts,science,"  Tesla CEO Elon Musk says Twitter deal cannot move forward, claims 20 per cent of all accounts are fake Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his deal to buy Twitter can not move forward unless the company shows public proof that less than 5 per cent of the accounts on the social media platform are fake or spam. Mr Musk made the comment in a reply to another user on Twitter early on Tuesday local time. He spent much of the previous day in a back-and-forth with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who posted a series of tweets explaining his company's effort to fight bots and how it has consistently estimated that less than 5 per cent of Twitter accounts are fake. In his tweet on Tuesday, Mr Musk said that ""20 per cent fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter's SEC filings being accurate."" He added: ""Yesterday, Twitter's CEO publicly refused to show proof of 5 per cent. This deal cannot move forward until he does."" Twitter declined to comment. ""You can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed,"" he said at a conference in Miami. On Friday, Mr Musk said his $US44 billion ($61.4 billion) deal to buy Twitter was on hold pending information on spam accounts. He said he suspects fake accounts make up at least 20 per cent of all users on the site — compared to Twitter's official estimate of 5 per cent. When asked at the All-In Summit conference whether the Twitter deal is viable at a different price, Mr Musk responded: ""I mean, it's not out of the question."" ""The more questions I ask, the more my concerns grow,"" he said. ""They claim that they've got this complex methodology that only they can understand. ""It can't be some deep mystery that is, like, more complex than the human soul or something like that."" Twitter shares extended losses in late afternoon trading after Mr Musk's comments. The stock dropped more than 8 per cent to close at $US37.39 ($53.44), lower than the day before Mr Musk revealed his Twitter stake in early April, sparking doubts that the billionaire entrepreneur would proceed with his acquisition of the company at the agreed price. Earlier, the Twitter chief executive officer tweeted that internal estimates of spam accounts on the social media platform for the last four quarters were ""well under 5 per cent,"" responding to days of criticism by Mr Musk of the company's handling of phoney accounts. Twitter's estimate, which has stayed the same since 2013, could not be reproduced externally given the need to use both public and private information to determine whether an account is spam, he added. Mr Musk responded to Mr Agrawal's defence of the company's methodology with a poop emoji. ""So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,"" Mr Musk wrote. Mr Musk has pledged changes to Twitter's content moderation practices, railing against decisions like the company's ban of former US president Donald Trump as overly aggressive while pledging to crack down on ""spambots"" on the platform. Mr Musk has called for tests of random samples of Twitter users to identify bots. He also said, ""there is some chance it might be over 90 per cent of daily active users."" Elon Musk says he will allow Donald Trump to return to the social media platform if he follows through with his plan to buy it. Independent researchers have estimated that anywhere from 9 per cent to 15 per cent of the millions of Twitter profiles are bots. Twitter does not currently require users to register using their real identities and expressly permits automated, parody and pseudonymous profiles on the service. It does ban impersonation and spam and penalises accounts when the company determines their purpose is to ""deceive or manipulate others"" by engaging in scams, coordinating abuse campaigns or artificially inflating engagement. Mr Musk's comments to a private audience could add to concerns about his disclosures of market-moving information. The Tesla CEO, known for his candid Twitter posts, has a long history of skirmishes with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Recently, Mr Musk was criticised by a US judge for trying to escape a settlement with the SEC requiring oversight of his Tesla tweets.

26,More than 100 dresses donated for high school ball in 'overwhelming' response to call for help,science,"  Kambalda West District High School receives 100s of dresses following social media post Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A modern-day version of Cinderella has played out at a regional Western Australian high school after it was inundated with clothing donations for students wishing to attend their school ball. The fairy godmother in this story is Kambalda West District High School principal Candice Brown, who put the word out on social media to ensure every student could attend the ""rite of passage"". Her Facebook post asking for help on May 9, just 12 days before this Friday's ball, resulted in donations of more than 100 dresses and other formal wear, including shirts, vests and shoes. Ms Brown described the response as ""overwhelming"". ""It just started on a whim because we were worried about some students not being able to go to the ball,"" she said. She said the donations had reduced the pressure for students and families as the cost of glamming up for the ball could be cost prohibitive for some . ""It's hard to buy a ball dress in town in Kambalda, or even in Kalgoorlie,"" Ms Brown said. ""If you go [buy] online, it may not arrive in time, but we also became aware that some students said they weren't coming to the ball and we wanted to make sure there were no road blocks."" Ms Brown asked on Facebook if anybody had any spare dresses, ""so we could make a wardrobe, where the students could borrow dresses from us"". ""It started there, and we've just been inundated … we've got dresses coming from everywhere,"" she said. A church from nearby Kalgoorlie donated 20 dresses, while an anonymous donor also contributed $500 to a Kalgoorlie fashion outlet for the students. Ms Brown said she had been contacted by schools in Perth, and the Hilton and Springfield primary schools were being used as drop-off points for donations. ""I remember when my own children went to the ball,"" she said. ""It's an exciting time and a time to let your hair down and have a great time with your friends. ""My own children are 21 and 22 and have dresses in the cupboard and I thought, 'Surely other people have dresses they don't wear?' ""The dresses are special, but they don't belong in the cupboard and I am sure people would like to see them put to good use."" She said the ""closet"" they were making would allow girls to borrow the dresses and bring them back so they could be cleaned. ""We will have a range of dresses for next year and so they won't have to wear the same dresses again,"" Ms Brown said. ""We've also got some clothes that children can wear to job interviews and hopefully this can set them up for the future.""

27,This 10-minute virtual reality experience is designed to counter suicidal thoughts with awe,science,"  UNSW’s Felt Experience and Empathy Lab combines art and technology to design psychosocial supports for wellbeing Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Picture entering a room that is like a blank canvas: colourless and bare apart from a door, two windows, and a virtual reality headset. Curiosity compels you to pick up the headset. At first, you see a simulation of the same bare room; the colours, scale, and layout remain unchanged. As you move about the room, you discover you can interact with elements of both your physical and virtual environments — what is known as a 'mixed reality' experience — and these small interactions transform the space. You open a window and the scene beyond morphs into a lofty mountain landscape; a luscious meadow; a sun-soaked beach. Edge of the Present is a 10-minute immersive and sensory installation developed by a team of mental health specialists, artists and technologists from Sydney's Felt Experience and Empathy Lab (fEEL). ""We spent a lot of time thinking about 'What would be awesome and how could you feel it?'"" says Professor Jill Bennett, director of the Big Anxiety Research Centre (BARC) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), which incorporates fEEL. fEEL uses cutting-edge immersive technology to create trauma-informed sensory experiences and tools — ranging from virtual reality installations to live art and performance. ""Art always gives greater freedom [and] that's a significant add-on to what psychotherapy allows. Especially in trauma therapy, because trauma is [an experience that is] hard to express,"" Professor Bennett says. The project was developed in consultation with people with lived experiences of suicide survival, and draws on neuropsychological research on the importance of cultivating imagination and future-thinking in preventing suicide. ""This is a new kind of practice, where we're knitting together distinct expertise to create something new that is built on a long tradition of psychotherapy,"" Professor Bennett says. In creating Edge of the Present, the fEEL team set out to design a sensory experience that would evoke positive mental imagery and a sense of awe. ""Because people with severe depression don't tend to experience awesomeness. In fact, they often have what's referred to as 'overgeneral memory': when they think about themselves in the past or when they think about their future, which uses the same kind of neural pathways, they don't have a lot of emotion attached to that,"" Professor Bennett says. In addition to the eight dynamic landscapes that evolve within the installation, Edge of the Present incorporates sensory stimulants — including a simulated breeze and snow. ""It's hard not to be uplifted by that, and when we test it on people, their mood improves and feelings of hopefulness improve."" Professor Bennett's team at fEEL draws on what is known as psychosocial design to study embodied experiences of mental illness, trauma and aging. ""At the moment, there is great interest in moving beyond just the narrow clinical or medical realm and saying, you know, we need to think of trauma support more broadly,"" she says. Get a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by subscribing to our monthly newsletter In the context of mental health care, psychosocial interventions are broadly understood as therapeutic strategies that are non-pharmacological (i.e.don't rely on medication) and instead focus on improving social and psychological factors that may be contributing to mental ill health. Psychosocial interventions encompass a wide range of strategies, including cognitive and behavioural therapies, group therapy, exercise, skills training, community engagement and creative activities. Through their community consultation and collaborative research, Professor Bennett's team applies a psychosocial lens to designing creative projects that explore trauma and enhance wellbeing. ""[We create] tools and programs that are beneficial to people's mental health — but not just mental health conceived as a chemical imbalance in the brain and an individual thing, but that understands people's interactions, the social determinants of trauma and mental health, and how environments and social relationships can contribute to better mental health,"" says Professor Bennett. In developing Edge of the Present, one of the key psychosocial design considerations was embedding agency in the way participants interact with the space. ""We didn't just want to create this 'blissed out' experience, because with suicidality, the really key thing is that you have a sense of your own agency and that you can make things happen. ""It's this sense of, you do a small action, and there's a reward. You can open doors and windows and that triggers something amazing,"" she says. The title of the project stems from a conversation with one of fEEL's lived experience collaborators, who described the state of suicidality as ""being on the edge of the present"" and unable to see into the future. ""What we're saying is, 'Let's just see what can happen, just try this one tiny thing, and see if you can create some change'."" Professor Bennett says people who haven't experienced suicidality may underestimate the significance of being able to take a small forward action. ""As [someone] in our focus group pointed out, you might be able to experience awe in actual nature and, at a certain point, virtual nature doesn't replace real nature. But the point is that you have to plan a trip, you have to drive there … [with this tool], you open a door and it's not one but eight massive experiences in succession. ""And that's the key thing if you are in major depression or if you're suicidal; to get that instant hit is really important,"" she says. In testing Edge of the Present, Professor Bennett's team conducted a pilot study to assess how participants felt after interacting with the installation, and found that positive mood and wellbeing increased by 16 and 13 per cent respectively, while feelings of hopelessness decreased by 35 per cent. ""There is a significant improvement in mood, and so what we want to do is to try to scale this and see if it can be sustained,"" says Professor Bennett. In Australia, suicide is the leading cause of death among young people. In 2020, deaths by suicide represented just under one in three deaths among people aged 15–17 (31 per cent) and around two in five deaths for people aged 18–24 (39 per cent). ABS data shows that over 90 per cent of people who died by suicide in 2020 reported at least one risk factor, and two-thirds of people experienced both mental and behavioural disorders and psychosocial risk factors. Katherine Boydell is a Professor of Mental Health at the Black Dog Institute and collaborated with fEEL on Edge of the Present, and says there is significant need for these kinds of projects to be scaled up and made more readily available. ""We've just applied for a grant to see if we can make this immersive experience more accessible, so that you don't have to have the actual physical structure of the room — you can just put on a headset,"" she says. Creative and non-pharmacological approaches to addressing mental ill health are becoming increasingly important in Australia, Professor Boydell says — particularly in overcoming some of the barriers to help-seeking associated with more traditional or clinical approaches. Research shows that around one in two Australians experiencing mental ill health do not seek help (although hearteningly, the treatment rate is improving). ""One of the barriers to help-seeking in the formal system has been stigma. And when you think about community resources, [arts-based interventions] are almost like a stealth intervention because it's not focused on mental health — it's focused on doing something else to have an impact on mental health,"" Professor Boydell says. In 2020, the Productivity Commission's mental health inquiry identified ""significant gaps"" in psychosocial support services because of inefficient and short-term funding arrangements, and identified a need to scale up services to make them more accessible. The report found that of the estimated 290,000 Australians who experience severe mental illness, only a quarter currently access psychosocial support measures through government-funded programs. Professor Boydell says this emphasises the need for a ""whole-of-community approach"". ""We have good evidence that engaging in the arts has all of these wonderful positive impacts on overall mental health and wellbeing. ""Especially, when it comes to this 'epidemic of loneliness' … [arts-based] social prescribing programs can really address some of those broader social determinants of health in a more holistic way,"" she says. According to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), mental health is the number one reason Australians visit the GP, and has been for the past five years in a row. The need for expanded support services has only been accelerated by the pandemic, with ABS data from 2020-21 showing that 15 per cent of Australians aged between 16-85 experienced high or very high levels of psychological distress, up from 13 per cent in 2017-18. Young Australians were more than twice as likely as older Australians to experience high or very high levels of psychological distress, with a rate of 20 per cent for people aged 16-34 years compared with 9 per cent for those aged 65-85 years. Professor Bennett echoes the need to develop arts-based psychosocial support measures at scale. ""We're very much concerned with delivering psychosocial benefits. And this is common to approaches that focus on trauma — because trauma, for the most part, is not an illness of the brain; it's something that results from an event or a set of conditions that are traumatising,"" says Professor Bennett. ""Treatment can't just be pharmacological, it has to be looking at how we can change a situation, how we can bolster someone's sense of agency and control, and how we can enable them to develop what's sometimes called resilience."" She says arts interventions and programs are particularly well-placed as psychosocial support strategies. The benefits of creative practice on mental health and wellbeing are widely documented. From treating anxiety and depression to Alzheimer's Disease and post-traumatic stress disorder, there is an overwhelming body of evidence in favour of integrating arts and creativity into mental health care. Last October, RACGP called upon the federal government to invest in a national social prescribing scheme to address the worsening mental health crisis fanned by COVID-19. Professor Boydell says: ""[Social prescribing] is about thinking about informal and community resources that can address health and mental health issues that are more aligned with a 'social determinants of health' approach."" ""So if you've got somebody who's going to a clinic for depression, but they're depressed because they're marginally housed, or they're in debt over their heads, or they're lonely, then you can begin to imagine that no amount of psychosocial interventions or medication is going to address that issue,"" she says. That's where social prescribing can help. Through her work at the Black Dog Institute, Professor Boydell has spent many years researching and evaluating the benefits of arts-on-prescription programs, which are a subset of social prescribing. In Space 22, a six-part documentary series premiering on ABC TV on Tuesday night (May 17), seven Australians with lived experiences of mental ill health take part in an arts-on-prescription experiment. With the support of mental health specialists, including Professor Boydell, participants explore past traumas through a series of creative workshops led by multidisciplinary artist Abdul Abdullah, Archibald-winning visual artist Wendy Sharpe and singer-songwriter Eddie Perfect. Vivienne, a 55-year-old retired medical researcher, is one of the show's participants. She heard about the program through a community centre she is involved with in Sydney's inner west, and says that as a scientist she was excited at the prospect of exploring how art impacts the brain. ""There are feelings inside of me that, even when they come up, are really hard to express in words,"" she says. ""And I thought if I can express them in other ways because, you know, art is a form of expression … maybe that would be really good."" Vivienne has had a long journey with mental health. As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), she describes herself as a fighter. ""I started being abused when I was five. My life has been about recovering from that experience."" In her twenties, Vivienne turned to drugs and alcohol as a way to cope. ""I just needed something to soothe me and to take the pain away really,"" she says. ""My whole adult life has been about getting therapy and maintaining my sobriety, but there've been times where I've gone back into that and lost faith in the process. And then I've had to come back out of it again. ""I'm lucky because a lot of people don't make it."" She says she reached a turning point about five years ago, when she turned 50, and is now in a place where she feels ""less attached to the past"". Embarking on the Space 22 project was a transformational experience for Vivienne. She says working with Wendy Sharpe was particularly affecting. ""Wendy really got to the heart of us, you know. She wanted us to paint our feelings. For me, that was the process where my brain actually felt like it switched. Like, almost my thought pattern changed. ""It's just a different way of seeing things and it's really brought out the colours in everything,"" she says. Professor Boydell was recruited to help assess the efficacy of the Space 22 program, and its impact on participants' wellbeing. ""In Space 22, [the participants] are expressing their experiences by using visual and performative and literary means, so it's another way of sharing things that are difficult to put into words and to talk about,"" she says. ""I also think it creates this sense of not being alone, a sense of community, and [a] decrease in isolation or feelings of loneliness… not to mention the capacity to be creative."" Professor Boydell says these connections can be ""transformative"". Having never participated in artistic practice prior to Space 22, Vivienne says that painting is now a part of her life. ""There's such a strong connection between me and the canvas. Like, it's the only thing I can see. It's amazing."" She says putting on music and painting has become a way for her to self-soothe. ""That's why I used to take drugs because I couldn't soothe myself. Post-traumatic stress lives in your central nervous system and it becomes unbearable if left untreated. ""I'm telling you, doing the painting, just watching the colour go on, it's so soothing, which is what we all need. ""And that's the stuff that gets me through the difficult days.""

28,What happens after sunset? These researchers have found a way to generate solar power at night,science,"  Australian researchers show solar power can be generated at night Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Australian researchers have made a major breakthrough in ""night-time solar"" technology. In what they claim is a world first, a team of researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) has demonstrated that solar power can be generated at night. ""In a sense, we've only been dealing with half of the opportunity, when we use photovoltaic solar cells to collect sunlight [during the day],"" project leader Associate Professor Ned Ekins-Daukes tells ABC RN's Drive. So, what's behind this unlikely breakthrough? After the sun sets and the day darkens, Professor Ekins-Daukes says the potential for solar energy well and truly remains. ""We get energy from the sun — it arrives, it warms up the Earth but then the Earth actually radiates the exact same amount of energy back out into space,"" he says. ""As the energy flows from the Earth's surface … [there is a] thermal emission out into the universe that we can tap."" Professor Ekins-Daukes and his team contend that if the flow of this radiant heat could be tapped by a power cell device and converted into electricity, there's ""a large and unused spectrum of potential power to be exploited."" So, in a new study published in ACS Photonics, the team used a thermoradiative diode (a semiconductor sensor found in existing technologies like night-vision goggles) to capture photons leaving Earth along the infrared spectrum and converted them into electricity. ""What you're doing is interrupting that flow of radiant heat, which is released every night out into the universe anyway, and tapping off a little bit of electricity from that,"" Professor Ekins-Daukes says. He says what's ""really exciting"" is the technology ""allows us to generate electricity at night, just from the cold night sky."" Australia is one of the world's biggest adopters of rooftop solar. Since 2001, the number of customers with solar panels has ballooned to more than 3 million. And in 2021, there was a record uptake of more than 3,000MW of rooftop solar installed by Australian householders. Professor Ekins-Daukes stresses this new ""night-time solar"" technology is still very much in its early days. ""We've just demonstrated that this is possible … Right now, the device we've made is relatively low power. [But] this is to be expected when you're at the very early stages,"" he says. The amount of energy produced was only extremely small — roughly equivalent to 1/100,000th of a solar powered cell. But the team argues that it is the ""proof of concept that is big."" ""The question here for the thermoradiative diode is how can we get from this scientific demonstration, through to scaling the manufacturing to a level where we could get the cost down. And that really depends on how engaged industry can be,"" Professor Ekins-Daukes says. ""It will take some time … And I have to be honest, we need to find some new materials to achieve [widespread use]."" But he says, in the future it may be possible to combine photovoltaic devices, or the solar panels widely in use today, and the thermoradiative diode for ""night-time solar"" power. ""You could have a panel that generates power during the day, but then could also power the other items that are still running in your house at night.""

29,Australia ranks 65th in the world for broadband speeds — but there's good news on the way,science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog There was a time, not long ago, when internet infrastructure policy was a big part of any federal election campaign. Politicians in hard hats would spar over acronyms like FTTN and FTTP, and talk glowingly about the knowledge economy. That time appears to have passed, and yet Australia's broadband is still bad — at least compared to other countries. For more than a decade, our global rank has been slipping. On the authoritative Ookla Speedtest Global Index, we're now 65th, or about 30 spots lower than in 2013. And yet we've spent so much money on the network: more than $50 billion on fibre optic cables and those little green network boxes that have popped up on suburban verges everywhere. How did we end up here? When can we expect speeds like in Singapore, New Zealand, or the United States? And why aren't we hearing more about internet infrastructure this election? Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues Remember something called the NBN? Experts have called the prolonged and costly rollout of the National Broadband Network ""Australia's greatest infrastructure disaster"". It's both the reason the national median speed for fixed-line broadband is low — and the only way to make it any better. In 2009, the Rudd government announced it would build a modern fibre optic telecommunications network. Those outside the network footprint would be provided broadband access through fixed wireless and satellite technologies. All up, it was estimated the NBN would cost $41 billion. The ABC has developed an internet connection widget which shows how your connection compares to other options in terms of speed, reliability and cost. But even as the first cables were being laid, there were calls to change the model. In the lead-up to the 2013 election, the Coalition proposed what it said would be a cheaper version: Instead of running fibre to every premise (fibre to the premise, or FTTP), it would run fibre part of the way, and use the existing copper-and-cable network for the rest. In practice, this mostly consisted of running the fibre to small neighbourhood network boxes, or nodes, which connected to the copper network servicing each house (fibre to the node, or FTTN). The Coalition won the election and estimated the cut-down version would cost $29.5 billion and be completed by 2019. A few months later, that estimate was revised to $41 billion. By 2019, the cost had blown out to $51 billion, and the network was not complete. Along the way, new technologies were introduced like fibre to the curb (FTTC) and fibre to the distribution point (FTTdp). But none of these clocked speeds as fast as FTTP. In late 2020, the Coalition and NBN Co (the government-owned corporation that operates the network) declared the network was complete, with a small fraction of homes waiting to be connected. By then, NBN Co had told Senate Estimates that the network, including planned upgrades, would cost $57 billion. But that wasn't the end of the story: the NBN wasn't fast enough. The mostly FTTN network is now in the process of being upgraded to FTTP (yes, that was the original idea), which could push the total cost past $70 billion once it's completed later this decade. Yep, $70 billion. Mark Gregory, an RMIT telecommunications and network engineering expert and long-time critic of the NBN rollout, estimates the NBN will have cost at least that much once all the FTTN connections have been upgraded to FTTP. ""If we had stuck with the original plan of FTTP, it would have been built for $50 billion,"" he said. ""This is Australia's greatest infrastructure disaster."" What the original FTTP NBN would have cost is hotly debated. In 2013, NBN Co was estimating that the peak funding cost for Labor's FTTP network would be $44 billion. A subsequent review found it could have been about $60 billion. But that estimate was based on an assumption of higher interest rates, and therefore debt repayments, than eventuated. With low interest rates, the FTTP NBN may have cost less than $55 billion. Whatever the exact final figure, it would have been less than the cost of installing FTTN and then ripping it out a few years later to build FTTP, said Paul Budde, an independent telecommunications analyst. ""Because now you have to retrofit FTTP to FTTN,"" he said. ""You have an enormous amount of node boxes on the scrap heap, as we now have the fibre going to the home directly."" The current NBN is a mix of technologies and acronyms. Of the 11.8 million premises able to be connected to the network, about half have either FTTN or FTTC (which is slightly faster than FTTN). About 20 per cent have something called Hybrid Fibre Coaxial, which is where older cables installed for broadband and television services have been adapted for use in the NBN. Another 20 per cent or so have FTTP. And the remainder (about 1.1 million homes) are in regional areas that cannot access the fixed-line network, and rely on fixed wireless or satellite internet. FTTN and the continued use of the old and decaying copper network was the reason Australia had slower median fixed-line internet speeds than almost every country in the 38-member Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Mr Budde said. ""Other countries that are way ahead of us have fibre [ie. FTTP] already."" ""We will be slowly catching up over the rest of this decade as these other countries have basically rolled out what they need to roll out. ""It will take the rest of this decade to complete the NBN to a full high-speed high-quality broadband network."" In contrast with previous election campaigns, internet infrastructure and the NBN has barely rated a mention over the past few weeks. Both the Coalition and Labor have plans to upgrade the NBN to FTTP. In late 2020, the Coalition announced $4.5 billion in upgrades to 8 million premises to get speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) by 2023. That's about 20 times faster than the 50 megabits per second (Mbps) home plan. Once completed, 75 per cent of fixed-line premises will have access to these ultra-fast speeds. For premises outside of the fixed-line network, the Coalition promises to provide $480 million to partly fund NBN Co's upcoming $750 million upgrade of the fixed wireless network. It says this will ease demand on the Skymuster satellite internet network, which will mean faster connection speeds for the remaining users. Labor says it will upgrade even more connections to FTTP. In November last year, it pledged a further $2.4 billion of NBN upgrades by 2025, if it wins government in Saturday's election. This, combined with the FTTP upgrades already announced by NBN Co, would extend access to gigabit connection speeds to 10 million premises, or 90 per cent of the fixed-line footprint. Labor has also committed to supporting the planned NBN fixed wireless upgrade. And while the Coalition wants to privatise the NBN, Labor has promised that if it wins government, the network would be kept as a public asset, arguing this would keep prices low. Mr Budde described the two parties' NBN policies as fairly similar. ""There's no major difference between the two at this stage. ""What Labor is promising, the Coalition will do — and the other way around."" RMIT's Dr Gregory observed neither party appeared to want to draw attention to the amount of money spent on the NBN. ""The government itself doesn't have anything to crow about,"" he said. ""And Labor this election is going for a small target approach."" NBN Co maintains a list of towns and suburbs earmarked for FTTP upgrades, with new locations being announced every few months. But homes in these areas will not automatically be upgraded to FTTP. John Howard spawned the idea, Kevin Rudd forced it into existence, Tony Abbott wanted to throttle it, Malcolm Turnbull saved it from almost certain death and now Scott Morrison will have to carry the can for it. Users must first order a higher-speed plan than they already have — of at least 100Mbps — and keep it for at least a year. NBN Co will then install the FTTP connection at no extra cost. Prices vary between providers, but if you're already on a 50Mbps plan, you can expect to pay about $20 more per month for a 100Mbps plan, and $70 more for the fastest 1000Mbps plan. This on-demand approach has drawn criticism, with some saying it risks entrenching a digital divide between affluent suburbs with access to FTTP internet and poorer ones stuck with FTTN. Avoiding this situation was the whole point of spending public money on a national network, Dr Gregory said. ""A lot of people simply won't be able to afford FTTP."" How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' Others might argue that 50Mbps is fast enough and FTTP for everyone is a needless extravagance. The metaverse and virtual real estate is booming — and so is the need for fast internet connections. In 2013, then-communications minister Malcolm Turnbull argued that 25Mbps would be ""more than enough"" for most households. Almost 10 years later, in February this year, the ACCC found almost three quarters of homes are paying for speeds of 50Mbps or higher. The irony of the lack of attention given to NBN policy this election is that the past few years have highlighted the importance of a fast and robust national broadband network. The pandemic and the switch to working from home saw the fixed-line network struggle in some areas. Gaming, virtual reality, and the ongoing trend of working from home will see greater demand for faster internet speeds, says University of Melbourne laureate professor Rod Tucker. ""What are the future applications that require higher and higher bandwidth? No-one really knows."" Portioning out bandwidth to households according to an idea of what should be ""enough"" is also a mistake, says Professor Tucker, who's also the director of the Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society. ""Some households will want less and some will want more,"" he said. ""We don't provide electricity to houses based on what the average house wants — we provide as much as we need or want."" No. At least not for a few decades. ""There's no replacement technology on the horizon,"" Mr Budde said. Mobile technology like 5G offers very fast speeds, but doesn't have the capacity to handle the required large amounts of traffic. Similarly, satellite internet like Starlink can be very fast, but is more suited to regional areas with a low density of users. ""For the foreseeable future, the NBN will be the network that will do the job for Australia,"" Mr Budde said.

30,"Tonga's volcanic eruption the largest explosion recorded since 1883, scientists say",science,"  Tonga volcanic eruption confirmed as the largest explosion recorded since 1883 Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Scientists say the eruption of Tonga's Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano was the largest explosion documented by researchers since 1883. Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai's eruption, which has been blamed for just six deaths, was similar in size to the Krakatoa explosion in Indonesia in 1883, according to the findings published in Science. The Tonga explosion generated pressure waves, called Lamb waves, which travelled horizontally along Earth's surface for more than six days, according to the article. Those Lamb waves are usually associated with large, atmospheric explosions, such as other volcanic eruptions and nuclear tests. The Tonga volcanic eruption produced similar Lamb waves as the Krakatoa eruption that killed more than 30,000 people. Scientists said nuclear explosions that have also created Lamb waves — such as the largest nuclear test in the USSR in 1961 — were of similar amplitude but lasted for a shorter period of time compared to large volcanic explosions such as the one in Tonga. That's because volcanic explosions are much more complicated and not as pointed as nuclear explosions. January's eruption also produced audible sounds that could be heard up to 10,000 kilometres away in Alaska and generated infrasound — sound that can't be heard by humans — that echoed around the world. Professor Corentin Caudron — who co-authored the article — told the ABC that researchers had used more than 3,000 sensors and instruments around the globe, commonly used to detect earthquakes and tsunamis, to arrive at their findings. ""What we did, essentially, was to compare what we extracted, in terms of information, about all these waves that propagated around the globe, [and] compare that eruption with others that occurred in the past,"" Professor Caudron said. Satellite imagery and social media posts capture the moments the underwater volcano off the coast of Tonga erupted, causing shock waves felt worldwide. He said that, while instruments used in 1883 were of a lower resolution than those used now, they detected the same thing. ""It's probably one of the first times we can see a Lamb wave associated with a volcanic explosion, and Krakatoa also did the same thing … it's the first time we can see those Lamb waves in a very detailed way."" Monash University volcanologist and adjunct associate professor Heather Handley said the article confirmed what was observed after the eruption. Dr Handley said the Tonga explosion highlighted how the international community needed to work together to be prepared for a potentially worse volcanic eruption. ""[Another eruption] will happen. The world will have to be prepared to work globally, together, to make sure that when that … size of an eruption occurs that we're ready and best prepared because it could affect global food supply, network chains, communication systems,"" Dr Handley said. January 15's explosion triggered a tsunami that destroyed large parts of Tonga and blanketed volcanic ash over the kingdom. The Pacific Island nation was isolated from the rest of the world for more than a month when the eruption and tsunami cut the country's only undersea internet cable, leaving people overseas unable to contact family and friends in Tonga. Scientists are scrambling to piece together an unprecedented cascade of events that led to and followed a volcanic eruption in Tonga. Tsunami waves were observed across the Pacific and reportedly damaged docked boats in New Zealand and caused an oil spill in Peru which was declared an environmental emergency. The World Bank estimated the damage bill from the disaster will cost Tonga more than $125 million — equivalent to approximately 20 per cent of its GDP. About 600 buildings across Tonga were damaged or destroyed by the tsunami — half of those homes — and an estimated 1,525 people were displaced. The tsunami brought the most devastation to the country's tourism sector because it damaged resorts and natural attractions, while the agricultural sector was heavily impacted by volcanic ash.

31,"Scott Morrison and the Labor Party are hot Google topics, but how much of that online activity will play out at the polls?",science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian voters spend a lot of their lives online, but how much of that activity will be reflected by their choices on polling day? A political expert has warned that online search trends and social media activity were not reliable indicators of how the federal election would play out. Latest Google Trends data for the Australian federal election showed the Labor Party made up 35 per cent of search interest in political parties over the past week, followed by the United Australia Party at 22 per cent and the Liberal Party at 14 per cent. When it came to search interest in political leaders over the past week in Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison claimed 57 per cent of searches, compared to just 23 per cent for federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese. But Charles Sturt University professor in political science Dominic O'Sullivan said those figures were not a useful indication of how people would vote. ""Google Trends is just one narrow measure of what's happening online and Google Trends certainly isn't a predictor of people's voting intentions,"" he said. ""For example, while the ALP has attracted more searches than any other political party in the last little while, many of those searches relate to the recent resignation of the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Michael Gunner. ""It's unlikely that that would have any impact on the federal election positively or negatively, except perhaps in the two NT seats."" The most searched political issue in Australia over the past week, according to Google data, was COVID-19, which Professor O'Sullivan suggested was an online trend that political candidates should instead be taking note of. ""They are things that parties should take notice of because they do give a sense of what people are interested in and they do tend to match up with what polling tells us about the issues of importance and COVID, not surprisingly, is one of them. ""However, the fact that people are searching for COVID-19 and health policy more broadly doesn't tell us what they're thinking."" Professor O'Sullivan said social media could also be an unreliable indicator of political sentiment. He said it was an important place for local candidates to engage with their communities and to advertise but it also allowed for the creation of an ""echo chamber"". ""When we read our Twitter feeds, we are just getting fed back to us our own thinking because of the kinds of people we are inclined to follow,"" Professor O'Sullivan said. ""You might get a sense of public mood but it's a narrow sense of the public whose views you are receiving.""

32,Dame Edna's favourite flower the face of gardening industry's new challenge,science," ABC Rural Gladioli gardeners make the most of pandemic gardening boom Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Nestled between dry paddocks in South Australia's south-east, an oasis of colourful gladioli flowers, photographed from the air, blooms under the scorching summer sun. Gladioli are perennial flowers that blossom during the summer. They grow from a corm, which is similar to a bulb, and are known for their sword-like leaves and funnel-shaped flowers. If they look familiar, it might be because 'gladdies' are also a favourite of Aussie icon Dame Edna Everage. These rows of striking blooms near Bordertown are no accident. They've been grown by a local family for more than 50 years. The Ridgway family started growing gladioli in 1969. Ted Ridgway planted the flowers looking for a way to diversify the family business after wheat quotas, to limit production, were introduced. He was 18 years old and had left school the year before. ""Being an entrepreneurial sort of person I thought maybe I could get into some horticultural thing,"" he said. ""I put my whole life savings of $600 into the business and bought some cardboard boxes of bulbs that fit into the back of my old man's station wagon and brought them home."" Mr Ridgway initially grew them for the cut flower market, but now the family only sells corms. A lot has changed in the production process, including adding mechanisation. ""When I first harvested corms years ago I used to get four old ladies to come out from Wolseley and it was all backbreaking work,"" he said. ""It was all pretty archaic, but we did it."" Mr Ridgway's son Andrew has taken over the reins of the operation. ""We import the little [corms] and grow them into bigger ones,"" he said. ""We harvest them, process them, clean them, size them, and then sell them to the home gardener trade throughout Australia."" Pandemic gardening became popular during COVID-19 lockdowns with people wanting an excuse to get outside. Plants, bulbs, seeds, and fruit trees flew off the shelves at garden centres around Australia. Andrew Ridgway said business boomed. ""Not being able to spend your money on going to Bali, Australians wanted to spend their money on themselves,"" he said. ""Home gardening has been wonderful."" The Ridgways' products completely sold out over the past two years. The president of Nursery and Garden Industry South Australia, David Eaton, said the gardening trend started with edible plants. ""As soon as COVID hit, people planted them up in the gardens to secure their vegetable crops moving forward,"" Mr Eaton said. The craze then moved to indoor plants before consumers started to invest more in flowers. ""They wanted some brightness,"" he said. The Ridgway family had increased plantings by 25 per cent hoping home gardeners will keep up their newly-found hobby. ""This year will be a real test to see whether the inspiration to keep gardening will keep on going,"" Andrew Ridgway said. ""So there are 2 million bulbs this year. If we can sell 1.5 million of them that'll probably be the market. ""I wouldn't think there'd be much more room for that, could be a surprise. If we sell out that would be wonderful."" This is the garden industry's next challenge — keeping a new breed of gardeners interested. ""I think there's still a big future for the garden,"" Mr Eaton said. ""[People] have spent a lot of time over the past two years in their garden improving it. ""People don't want to see that go backwards. They don't want to see the weeds come in. ""Of the new people we brought into the industry, that started gardening, we'll probably be able to hopefully maintain 20 to 25 per cent.""

Australia will miss out on the eclipse this time, but it will be seen in the Americas, Antarctica, Europe, Africa and the eastern Pacific.

New Zealand, Eastern Europe and the Middle East will experience a penumbral lunar eclipse, where the edge of Earth's shadow will fall over the Moon. The Old Farmer's Almanac — which publishes Native American names for full Moons — calls it a ""flower Moon"" because May is known as a month when flowers bloom in abundance.

34,"'Once-a-year beer' tempts craft brew fans, fuels regional hop farm revival",science," ABC Rural WA craft brewer Boston Brewery creates wet hop beers to help sustain farms Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog WA craft breweries are experimenting with wet hop beers to tempt drinkers and help sustain farms in a region which lost its local hop industry decades ago. Boston Brewery head brewer Ben Bunker said he had a beer unlike any other, which was an achievement in an experimental industry where it was difficult to create something unique. He has made a wet hop beer using freshly harvested hops right off the bine rather than the dried and pelletised hops used in every other commercial variety. ""It's a bit of an ode to tradition,"" Mr Bunker said. ""Once upon a time all beer was made with fresh hops but they were only really good at that first time of the year when they were picked."" He said brewers would leave the hops hanging over rafters or pipework for the rest of the year. ""They would get this blue cheese or feet kind of smell and that would affect the quality of the beer as the year went on,"" he said. That issue led brewers to develop dried, pelletised hops which were used year-round. WA's commercial hop farms collapsed in the 1980s after Perth's Swan Brewery closed and the brand moved to South Australia. There were almost no hop farmers operating in the state for decades. WA hop farmer Trey Gee said the market completely fell out when Swan Brewery shifted their capacity to demanding pelletised hops in 1978. But a handful of commercial farmers have started selling to local craft breweries, including Aaron Alexander who has a small farm between Denmark and Albany. He picked his third hop harvest by hand in March. Drinkers were enjoying his produce a month later in the wet hop beer aptly labelled Cream of the Hops. ""The reason we started growing hops was basically to offer local breweries fresh local hops because they can't get them from interstate,"" Mr Alexander said. ""The breweries are starting to acknowledge there are local hops now."" He said locally-grown hops offered different flavours and aromas. ""Hopefully with time, it will become normal to see WA hops in our beers,"" he said. Brewers at the hundreds of craft breweries scattered across regional Australia can have a tough time creating beers that stand out. Wet hop beers grown, harvested and brewed in the same region are a way to create something unique without turning to aggressive flavours or additives. ""People often expect a wet hop beer to be super hoppy, like a hop bomb,"" Mr Alexander said. ""It's generally more subtle, more rounded and fresher."" Mr Alexander said he loved that wet hop beer tasted ""like the harvest"". Meanwhile, Mr Bunker said he looked forward to using something hyper-local. ""It's really good to be proud of something from the area that excites people,"" Mr Bunker said. ""The first question we often get is 'oh, we do hops here'?"" Bartender Callum McCamley said the beer attracted a diverse range of customers. ""Everybody wants to try it,"" Mr McCamley said. ""I personally have sold mainly to people in their 30s."" He said customers tended to have ""a really good knowledge of beer"". ""In fact, a lot of young ladies now are really enjoying the craft beers,"" he said. ""It's good to see a lot of young people enjoying something different at the pub."" A tasting event was planned in Perth in April to celebrate wet hop beers grown and brewed in WA's south-west region but it was cancelled after COVID-19 restrictions were introduced in WA. Mr Alexander said growers were eager to promote the harvest again next year with more wet hop varieties. Until then, the remainder of his 2022 harvest has been dried and pelletised for use in local breweries' less time-sensitive offerings.

35,'Giving the sad demise of majestic creatures another purpose': When it's your job to wade through dead whale blubber and guts ,science,"  Whale bone collector uncovering secrets of world's largest marine mammals Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog David Stemmer's job as head of the SA Museum's cetacean collection sometimes has him knee-deep in tonnes of blood and offal to recover rotting carcasses of the largest mammals on earth, but he's happily turning the ugly into something beautiful for the world to see. The SA Museum has the largest and most comprehensive collection of cetacea in Australia attracting researchers from around the world. About 38 different species of whales, dolphins and porpoises are stored for research with the bulk of the 1,400 piece collection made up of 900 dolphin specimens. Mr Stemmer said the collection allowed research on population dynamics to help preserve the marine mammals by identifying and minimising human impact. But there are logistical considerations and limits on their ability to learn more about the largest cetaceans — some whales are very rarely sighted while others are too remote or bulky to be recovered. ""In general, the large whales are much, much harder to study because of their size,"" Mr Stemmer said. ""You can't have 20 blue whales in your collection because there's not a lot of room and that makes it a little bit harder to study. ""For some studies, you need lots of individuals to be able to get a good answer — the classic morphological study that is done on smaller animals can't be done."" Scientists used the smallest molecules to learn about the largest animals. ""A lot of the studies involve the molecular, looking at genetics,"" Mr Stemmer said. ""With the baleen whales, you can sample the baleen plates for isotopes. ""They grow a bit like hair, they're keratin, and they grow over time so you can sample them along the outer edge and extract the different isotope signatures from where they've been through their lives because different areas have different isotope signatures."" COVID travel restrictions have impacted research. ""Pre-COVID, we had visitors every now and again studying the collection because one of the other problems with cetaceans is they're too big to post around the world and the country,"" Mr Stemmer said. What happens when a whale dies at sea and is washed ashore? The team waited for a baleen whale researcher from the US to be able to travel and assist in dissecting a rare pygmy right whale that came from Port Lincoln. Mr Stemmer said the fishing industry helped collect and freeze the whale. ""They managed to collect that whole whale for use and put it in one of their bait freezers,"" he said. ""We kept it in the freezer until the US researcher could fly over to us to dissect that whale with us — it was quite exciting."" The pygmy right whale is in its own family and is one of the smallest whales at about 6 metres in length. ""There aren't many places in the world where they occur and Port Lincoln is a hot spot — most of our pygmy right whale specimens have come from  Port Lincoln,"" Mr Stemmer said. He said it was exciting when a stranding was discovered. ""We find out about whale strandings pretty quickly and with smartphones we get photos and we can decide whether to collect it if it's accessible,"" Mr Stemmer said. ""You will literally be knee deep in blood and guts when you collect large whales. ""And you have to be able to keep breathing until you don't notice the smell anymore. ""We actually had to hire a front end loader to move a whale further up the beach so we could collect it and sharks were feeding off it as well."" At other times, just a sample of the whale would be taken. ""There was a large male sperm whale and we couldn't collect the whole animal, that was just too much but the local park ranger used a chainsaw to cut the lower jaws off for us."" Smaller specimens are placed in a 2,500-litre maceration vat with heated water that rots the flesh from the bones — a process that takes several months. ""We also have a large concrete tank, swimming pool size, 35,000 litres, where we put large whales but that tank is not heated so we're relying on a nice warm summer for the animal to rot away,"" he said. Mr Stemmer enjoyed giving a second life to the whales. ""To go out on a beach and have this dead, stinking blob there, collect it and turn it into a beautiful skeleton for the collection — it gives the sad demise of one of these majestic creatures another purpose.""

36,The family who found this orphaned animal thought they were helping it — but what they did resulted in the opposite,science,"  Found an orphaned animal? What you should do next, according to expert wildlife carers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Buddy the baby pademelon was emaciated, starving and his organs were shutting down when wildlife carer Jill* was contacted for help. But rather than surrender the joey into proper care that night, the person who found him on a Tasmanian roadside in his mother's pouch and took him home for a week, refused because the children wanted to keep the joey for another night. The next morning when the carer came calling, it was too late. ""He was extremely dehydrated, he'd been fed incorrectly, the incorrect formula, and nowhere near enough so he was absolutely emaciated,"" the Animal Rescue Cooperative's Tasmanian coordinator Trish Bone said. By the time the family decided to hand him on, he was past saving, she said. ""It's incredibly selfish behaviour by people to keep a joey, a wildlife creature that needs specialist feeding, specialist care, for someone to keep it, the wildlife always pays the price. ""Having a trained carer is the difference between life and death, between them suffering and not suffering, and for having their best chance of being raised to successful release."" The Animal Rescue Cooperative said Buddy's story was sadly not uncommon. The organisation has taken to social media to share the stories of wildlife ""misguided members of the public selfishly choose to keep as household pets, always causing suffering and usually a tragic outcome for those animals"". At the age of six months, George weighed less than a can of coke when he was seized from a member of the public. After three months in care, he's nearly doubled in weight but will never live in the wild again. ""He's less than a quarter of the size he should be so for him to be released now would ultimately be a death sentence,"" his carer Michelle said. Pademelon Tessa had never been outside until she was surrendered to Michelle. The blood red lines on the map of Tasmania, along every road, tell the story. The lines are actually dots, close together. The dots are roadkill reports — almost 60,000 of them. By that stage she was at least six months old and was still having bottles, using a kitty litter tray and her muscles hadn't developed properly from not being let out to hop. ""To take her outside, that was huge and very scary for her... she'd never smelt the bush, never been around other wallabies, never really had sunshine in her eyes so it's extremely sad in that respect,"" Michelle said. Suzy Nethercott-Watson is Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary's chief operations officer and has been a wildlife carer for the past 20 years. She said the sanctuary often received animals that had been kept as pets, and suffered serious health problems. ""A lot of our wildlife are animals that have a very complex gut system. ""Pademelons or Bennett's wallabies for example are part of a macropod family that have a form of digestion that's really complex, and if they're not getting the right food, their guts won't develop in the right way, and they'll be compromised for a long period of time. ""They're also really stressed by being in a human situation, and unfortunately, they won't show us that stress, because in the wild it's important for them not to show that they're weak in any way, so they often don't show the stress they are actually experiencing."" Ms Nethercott-Watson said there wasn't enough awareness about laws surrounding keeping wildlife as pets. ""Through the legislation you actually need to be licensed to be a wildlife carer and look after these animals,"" she said. ""If you are interested in helping these animals, the best thing to do is hand them over to trained carers."" In a statement a spokesperson from the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania said while it ""may be tempting for some people to care for an animal themselves, it is best looked after by an approved wildlife rehabilitator with the experience, skills, capacity and appropriate facilities to rehabilitate the animal for release back into the wild"". ""Members of the public who find sick, injured or orphaned wildlife should contact Bonorong Wildlife Rescue on 0447 264 625 (all hours, statewide)."" The spokesperson said the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania has developed Best Practice Guidelines for Wildlife Rehabilitation and is ""currently assisting in the development of a sector-led Wildlife Rehabilitation Sector Strategy that will improve community capacity and the longer-term sustainability of the sector"".

37,"If this is a hand grenade, it backs up a long-debated theory about the Crusades",science,"  Was this ancient vessel a hand grenade? If so, it backs up a long-debated theory about weapons in the Crusades Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Much is known about life in the Middle East at the time of the Crusades, but one type of vessel still presents something of a mystery. These ceramic artefacts are called sphero-conical vessels – a term describing their shape – and hundreds have been unearthed across the region. By studying the residue inside, archaeologists have established they were used to hold beer, medicine, oils and fragrances. Some believe they were also used as ancient hand grenades. Now, a team from Griffith University say their latest research provides proof of this theory. Carney Matheson and his colleagues have been analysing fragments from four sphero-conical vessels found in the 1960s. They date back to the 11th century, and were unearthed at a site called Armenian Gardens in Jerusalem. Residue from three of the vessels contain the presence of benign substances such as medicine and fragrances. Professor Matheson says chemical analysis has revealed that the fourth contains explosive material. ""There's a range of sphero-conicals, from thin-walled ceramics that could be used for drinking vessels, mercury containers, and all different sorts of stuff,"" says Professor Matheson. ""But these ones are thick-walled ceramics that we call stoneware. Small containers, small content, withstanding high pressures. ""This particular ceramic was found in the destruction layer of the Crusader fortress that the Arabs smashed."" Professor Matheson believes this fourth fragment, or sherd, is from a hand grenade used during the Christian Crusades — the religious wars initiated by Christians intent on reclaiming the Holy Land from Islamic rule. The earliest weapons resembling incendiary devices date back to the 7th century Byzantine Empire. In naval warfare the Byzantines famously used flame throwers to project a fluid known as ""Greek fire"", the precise ingredients of which were kept a military secret and remain a mystery to this day. This secret technology helped the Byzantines defend Constantinople from the Arab sieges of 674 and 717. The Griffith University research suggests the Arabs may have adapted Byzantine incendiary knowledge to develop explosive devices for warfare during the Crusades. Professor Matheson says the findings support both Arab and Crusader texts from the time which refer to Arab defenders using explosive devices. ""These vessels have been reported during the time of the Crusades as grenades thrown against Crusader strongholds producing loud noises and bright flashes of light. ""It is complicated, but one thing I think is certain is that the compositions that have been reported in the Arabic texts are consistent with a subset of the composite that we found in our vessel."" It's not the first time researchers have speculated about the use of grenades in the Middle East during the Crusades. A 1937 study examined sherds found in 1168 in Cairo, then known as Fustat. Those researchers also found evidence of explosive ingredients but were unable to prove it conclusively. ""That's when you had the Crusaders defending their fortress in Fustat, and the Arabs were throwing thousands of these weapons against them in the fortress,"" says Professor Matheson. The ABC's Religion & Ethics portal is home to reporting on religion, ethical discussion and inspiring stories of faith and belief. ""Their research only identified potassium nitrate and sulphur. They were missing the fuel, because the techniques they used couldn't identify the fuel. ""Our research has identified the potassium nitrate, plus other nitrates, the sulphur, plus the fuel. ""We've got the explosive ingredients of what we think to be the first locally developed explosive weapons in the Middle East and Europe."" The findings are also significant because they appear to rule out the use of Chinese black powder in the region at that time. Previous hypotheses suggested that black powder, the precursor to gunpowder, may have arrived in the Middle East before the 13th century but was kept a military secret. Professor Matheson says there is no evidence of black powder in the sherd residue. ""We have definitively shown it's not like powder. It's a local invention. And that's really, really important to say that we've got this local invented explosive ingredient."" Professor Matheson's findings are yet to convince some others working in the field, including Stéphane Pradines, an archaeologist at the Aga Khan University in London. Professor Pradines was the director of the excavations of the Walls of Cairo in Egypt, and is a specialist in Islamic archaeology and military architecture and weapons. ""Unfortunately, it is a sphero-conical vessel, but it is not a grenade,"" he says. ""The real grenades have thinner clay bodies. The sphero-conicals are stonewares with thick sections. ""Mercury was at the origin of the incendiary grenade's myth. We know what the real incendiary grenades look like; they are not sphero-conicals."" Professor Matheson agrees that previous studies couldn't prove the hand grenade hypothesis but says the Griffith research has applied a more comprehensive analysis of the ingredients. ""In our weapon, we had a very high quantity of magnesium. And if you remember back at school, when you lit the magnesium powder, it gave a bright flash,"" he says. ""The magnesium constituents that we have in our device may suggest that it is a specific type of grenade, a flash grenade."" Professor Carney says Crusader texts of the time back the findings up. A weekly digest of the best opinion, analysis and reporting on religion and ethics from ABC Radio National. ""The Crusaders' accounts include bright flashes, big bangs, and sticking to things and burning. ""In modern parlance, that would be a flash grenade, a percussion grenade."" He says further research into more sphero-conical vessels and other artefacts will ""put this question to rest"". ""My next research is to test more of the vessels of the same typology to see if we can confirm maybe that that typology was the grenade typology as opposed to others,"" he says.

38,This app allows you to find threatened species in your area — and petition your local member,science," Science Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Researchers have launched a web-based app that they hope will put Australia's ""threatened species crisis"" at the top of the election agenda. Threatened Australians, which was launched last week, allows users to access a profile of all the threatened species reported to be found — or which were until recently found — in their electorate. For each species that is recorded, there are details on what threats are causing the decline of the animals or plants in the selected electorate, and a ""how to help"" option. That option takes the user to a pre-written email addressed to their local sitting federal member, outlining the steps that member needs to take to strengthen protections for the species at risk. Other ""how to help"" options include connecting with NGOs working on local conservation projects. It's a politically non-partisan approach, which the developers said was born out of a recognition that ""Australian species are in a disastrous state"". App co-developer, conservation scientist James Watson from the University of Queensland, said he also hoped the tool would be used as a source of information for journalists, so that they might interrogate party leaders and environment portfolio holders on their policies. ""An app like this is set up for citizens to ask their member about species in their electorate and what they're going to do to stop them [going extinct],"" Professor Watson said. ""It's also set up for journalists and other stakeholders to ask questions around wildlife — instead of gotcha questions around the inflation rate, I would much rather questions about wildlife in their electorates.""' A number of researchers have been sounding the alarm over the continuing decline of Australia's native wildlife, which Professor Watson said had become much worse over the past decade. ""It's quite remarkable that the only real party talking about these wildlife issues is the Greens — the Opposition isn't bringing this up,"" he said. ""A fair-minded assessment would be that it hasn't been a good decade for wildlife — we've had declines in biodiversity around the country. ""All the science points to the fact that we haven't got a lot of time left — 10 to 20 years and a lot of these species will disappear, [but] there's still a chance it can be on the radar as we head to the polls."" As images of flooding fill our bulletins, it's important to remember that this isn't happening in a vacuum. Extreme weather is going to get more common under climate change. Labor has since announced $224.5 million over forward estimates for a national threatened species program. The Coalition has a Threatened Species Strategy, and committed $100 million to ""protecting Australia's biodiversity"" in the budget. The Threatened Species Index (TSX) is a database set up to measure the relative abundance of Australia's threatened and near-threatened species in order to track the success or failure of conservation efforts. According to the TSX data, on average there has been a steady decline in the relative abundance of birds, mammals and plants listed as threatened, vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered, going back to 1985, which is the earliest year for which they have data. The rate of decline for birds, mammals and plants began to accelerate around the late 1990s to early 2000s. Project manager for the TSX, Geoff Heard from UQ's Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation, said the Millennium Drought was likely the initial cause of that sharp decline in animal abundance. But habitat clearing, climate change, and bushfires combined to continue the downward trajectory long after the drought broke. The TSX is currently compiling its latest datasets, which will bring its measurements up to 2019, and Dr Heard says he thinks the trend of loss will continue. ""Habitat loss and degradation continues to be the main threat in Australia, with climate change coming over the top and [presenting] a more dominant threat over the last 20 years,"" Dr Heard said. ""So I would expect that trend to continue and potentially worsen — it wouldn't surprise me if it's worsened."" The Threatened Australians app developers note that the wildlife records for every electorate may not be perfect, but that they've sourced their data from ""the only current federal data available"", according to a statement on the website. Some of Australia's iconic and unique natural ecosystems are headed for irreversible damage if we keep emitting carbon at current rates, climate experts warn. But they're not necessarily the ones you might expect. One of those data sources — the Atlas of Living Australia — relies on information from citizen scientists reporting their own wildlife sightings. ""We wanted to utilise what is available to the public via the Australian government,"" the developers said. Euan Ritchie, a professor of wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University, said that lack of funding for science and the environment was one of the reasons it was difficult to get accurate wildlife distribution data. ""I think there's great potential for a tool like this, so a member of the public can see what species are in their area,"" Professor Ritchie said. ""For so many species, unfortunately, because of lack of funding, we don't have good biodiversity monitoring."" The release of the app comes amid criticism of the government's failure to release the State of the Environment Report before the election. The report, which is a comprehensive five-yearly independent assessment of the state of Australia's environment, was slated to be released early this year. After a review process by scientists last year, it was reportedly given to Environment Minister Sussan Ley last December. Under the Act, the Minister has 15 parliamentary sitting days to release it. The House has sat for 12 days since December. Ms Ley's office did not respond to a number of questions put forward by the ABC. However, an emailed response said that the report would be released ""within the statutory time frame set out under the Act"". Professor Ritchie said Australians had a right to see the report before the election. ""It's the most comprehensive environmental assessment we have,"" Professor Ritchie said. ""We know we're in the middle of this extinction and environmental crisis and Australian voters see climate change and the environment as the most important election issues. ""[They] have a right to see that assessment before they vote."" He says the report will probably tell us what we already know, but insists biodiversity loss should be part of the agenda this election. ""We know species are in trouble and we know the threatened species list is expanding,"" he said. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Professor Watson said releasing the report was crucial to accountability, and that more questions needed to be asked about biodiversity loss during the election campaign. ""It's no wonder that iconic species like the koala and platypus — that people around the world would expect us to be propping up and saving — have been going backward in the last 10 years,"" he said. ""Surely the government should be held to account and asked, 'What are you going to do to change the course for threatened species?'"" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

39,Skeleton of dinosaur that inspired Jurassic Park's velociraptor sold at auction for $17.9 million,science,"  Skeleton of Deinonychus antirrhopus, the dinosaur that inspired Jurassic Park's velociraptor, sold at auction for $17.9 million Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A rare skeleton of the dinosaur that inspired Jurassic Park's deadly velociraptor has sold at auction for $US12.41 million ($17.9 million). The sale, to an undisclosed bidder, far exceeded the estimated price of $US4 million to $US6 million, reflecting the rarity of dinosaur fossils going on sale privately. According to Christie's, the skeleton is the most complete Deinonychus antirrhopus specimen ever found, with approximately 126 fossil bones. The skeleton, nicknamed Hector, was excavated in Wolf Creek, Montana, in 1964 and has been in private hands since. According to the New York Times, it was excavated on private land by self-taught palaeontologists Jack and Roberta Owen and was acquired by unnamed private owners. The dinosaur was named Deinonychus antirrhopus by palaeontologist John Ostrom, who first discovered the species in 1964. Deinonychus means “terrible claw,” for the sharp hind claw found on each of the species feet. It roamed the earth between 115 and 108 million years ago, moving on two legs and likely hunting other dinosaurs individually, according to the Smithsonian. Dr Ostrom's study of the dinosaur established the evolutionary link between birds and dinosaurs. But it is its depiction in film and popular fiction that led to its celebrity status in popular culture. The author Michael Crichton featured the dinosaur prominently in his novels Jurassic Park and The Lost World. But for dramatic effect he instead used the name of a smaller, related dinosaur Velociraptor. Director Steven Spielberg continued to use the name velociraptor for the on-screen depiction of the dinosaur in his film adaptions. In reality, velociraptors were much smaller than Deinonychus antirrhopus, being about the size of a turkey. Crichton had consulted Dr Ostrom for the novels, and was apologetic about the name change, according to Christie's. According to the Smithsonian Magazine, the private sale of dinosaur skeletons is controversial, with palaeontologists concerned private collectors will hide specimens away from the public. Others suggest the high demand for specimens may open up private land for researchers and encourage more people to enter the field. The skeleton has only been publicly exhibited once, at the Natural History Museum of Denmark from 2020 to 2021.

40,Newborn giraffe given human medical-grade leg braces to save its life,science,"  Baby giraffe in US zoo fitted with custom leg braces to help it walk properly Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A baby giraffe born in a US zoo with a life-threatening leg condition has been fitted with customised, human medical-grade leg braces to help her walk. Msituni was born on February 1 at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, north of San Diego, with her front limb bending the wrong way. Safari park staff feared she could die if they didn't immediately correct the condition, which could prevent her from nursing and walking around the habitat. But they had no experience with fitting a baby giraffe in a brace. That proved especially challenging given she was a 178-centimetre newborn and growing taller every day. So, they reached out to experts in orthotics at the Hanger Clinic, where Ara Mirzaian landed his very first animal patient. Over the past three decades, Ara Mirzaian has fitted braces for everyone from Paralympians to children with scoliosis, but never animals, let alone a newborn giraffe. ""It was pretty surreal when I first heard about it,"" Mr Mirzaian told The Associated Press this week during a tour to meet Msituni, who was strutting alongside the other giraffes with no troubles. ""Of course, all I did was go online and study giraffes for like 24/7 until we got out here."" Zoos increasingly are turning to medical professionals who treat people to find solutions for ailing animals. The collaboration has been especially helpful in the field of prosthetics and orthotics. Earlier this year, ZooTampa in Florida teamed up with similar experts to successfully replace the beak of a cancer-stricken great hornbill bird with a 3D-printed prosthetic. The Hanger Clinic team in 2006 created a prosthetic for a Florida bottlenose dolphin that had lost its tail after becoming tangled in ropes from a crab trap. Their story inspired the 2011 movie ""Dolphin Tale."" But this was a definite learning curve for all, including Matt Kinney, a senior veterinarian for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in charge of Msituni's case. ""We commonly put on casts and bandages and stuff. But something that extensive, like this brace that she was provided, that's something we really had to turn to our human [medical] colleagues for,"" Mr Kinney said. Msituni suffered from hyperextended carpi — wrist joint bones in giraffes' front limbs, which are more like arms. As she overcompensated, the second front limb started to hyperextend as well. Her back leg joints also were weak but were able to be corrected with specialised hoof extenders. And given that she weighed more than 55 kilograms at birth, the abnormality was already taking its toll on her joints and bones. While the custom braces were being built, Mr Kinney first bought post-surgery knee braces at Target that he cut up and re-sewed, but they kept slipping off. Then Msituni wore medical-grade braces for humans that were modified for her long legs. But eventually Msituni broke one. For the custom braces to work, they would need to have a range of motion but be durable, so Hanger Clinic worked with a company that makes horse braces. Using cast mouldings of the giraffe's legs, it took eight days to make the carbon graphite braces that featured the animal's distinct pattern of crooked spots to match her fur. ""We put on the giraffe pattern just to make it fun,"" Mr Mirzaian said. ""We do this with kids all the time. They get to pick super-heroes, or their favourite team and we imprint it on their bracing. So why not do it with a giraffe?"" In the end, Msituni only needed one brace. The other leg corrected itself with the medical-grade brace. When they put her under to fit the custom brace, Mr Mirzaian was so moved by the animal's beauty, he gave her a hug. ""It was just amazing seeing such a big, beautiful creature just laying there in front of me,"" he said. After 10 days in the custom brace, the problem was corrected. All told, she was in braces for 39 days from the day she was born and stayed in the animal hospital the entire time. After that, she was slowly introduced to her mum and others in the herd. Her mum never took her back, but another female giraffe has adopted her, so to speak, and she now runs along like the other giraffes. Mr Mirzaian hopes to hang up a picture of the baby giraffe in her patterned brace so the kids he treats will be inspired to wear theirs. ""It was the coolest thing to see an animal like that walk in a brace,"" he said. ""It feels good to know we saved a giraffe's life.""

41,Contrasting solutions presented for how to build Australia's new and more flexible electricity system,science,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog To reduce emissions, incorporate new technology and energy sources, Australia needs a new electricity system. The grid of the future needs to be more stable, less centralised and handle large amounts of renewables. The question this election is how to build it. Brisbane company eleXsys wants to help transform the grid. It is making equipment to handle large amounts of electricity being fed back in by rooftop solar. ""The grid is a one-way grid,"" executive director Richard Romanowski told the ABC. ""It sends energy from the coal power or the solar farm into the city, but when you want to send energy backwards, it has a limit. ""It only lets 15–20 per cent of the energy go backwards. ""We fix that — we allow for 100 per cent energy going backwards — and that then allows us to decarbonise the whole world very fast and cheaply."" The company is assembling products by hand in an old petrol station in Brisbane, but a government grant will help them move to a purpose-built factory soon. ""The federal government grant is a huge leg-up to help us get going – it's phenomenal to get it,"" Mr Romanowski said. The Coalition said the grant was an example of its ""technology, not taxes"" approach to decarbonisation. It has made its own investments in grid infrastructure and is funding new gas and hydro power stations. Labor is promising to transform the grid faster by creating a new body called Rewiring the Nation. It would provide $20 billion of low-cost finance for power companies to build new transmission infrastructure, allowing them to connect more cheap renewables sooner. ""Rewiring the Nation will cover its real costs, not deliver a commercial return to government,"" Labor's Powering Australia policy stated. ""This will lower the cost of the upgrade, helping to ensure consumers get the lowest possible price, by shielding them from the risk of gold-plating in the necessary upgrade of transmission projects."" Labor said its plan aligned with the blueprint of the Australian Energy Market Regulator, but the Coalition said it would increase power prices. Green Energy Markets analyst Tristan Edis said some of Labor's promised spending may be unnecessary. ""Their main policy for building new transmission… some of that money could be better spent,"" he said. ""Labor have a far better framework than the Liberal Party, but there's a lot that's left unsaid in their policy that requires a lot more work."" The Coalition has also committed to new generation projects, including carbon-emitting gas power and the pumped hydro power scheme, Snowy 2.0. ""[The Coalition is] delivering reliable generation to support continued growth in renewables, empowering businesses and communities to make choices on their energy needs, making targeted investments in critical transmission projects where that stacks up for consumers, and implementing key reforms to protect consumers and deliver a fit-for-purpose post-2025 market design,"" a spokesperson for Energy Minister Angus Taylor told the ABC. The government has committed to reaching net zero by 2050, and says it is on track to beat its 2030 emissions targets. But what will it take to turn Australia green? But Mr Edis said the Coalition's policy did not do enough to lower emissions. ""They say they're committed to net zero but they've not put in any policies to require industry to achieve that,"" he said. ""Industry is saying… we need a clearer legal framework."" In contrast, Labor wants to change the rules for Australia's biggest polluters — tightening something introduced by the Coalition called the ""safeguard mechanism"". This key policy element would make polluters pay more for failing to reduce emissions, by gradually reducing the level of penalty-free emissions, or ""baselines"", allowed over time. ""[This is] a really good idea. It's actually supported by even a number of the big polluters and it's just sensible,"" Mr Edis said. Labor is also proposing to fund around 400 new community batteries for households that cannot afford their own. It is also proposing building 85 shared solar arrays — at a total cost of $100 million — to help people access renewable energy. Energy consultant Rachel Brdanovic, who works on community energy projects, told the ABC they were sensible ideas. ""They're kind of crunch points for the community in terms of people who want to put solar on will, people who can afford batteries will, but to get those things happening at a community level definitely needs government input,"" she said. But they did not go as far as Labor's 2019 policy of funding household batteries, to reach a target of 1 million across Australia. ""It's sort of a token distraction. The scale involved is too small to make a meaningful difference,"" Mr Edis said of the new policy. Where it all matters to voters is in terms of power prices. The Coalition says it has already brought them down. But the wholesale price of energy is going up because the price of gas is increasing and coal power plants have cut their output. The Australian Energy Market Regulator says renewables will lower energy prices in the next few years, as long as the upgrade of the grid is managed well.

42,Vote Compass analysis has examined the ‘teal’ vote — here’s what it tells us,science,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Concerns over climate change are breaking the traditional left-right political divide and helping drive the ""teal"" vote as conservative voters rebel without having to choose Labor or the Greens, according to Vote Compass analysis. Independent candidates are mounting challenges against sitting MPs in traditionally Liberal-held, wealthy electorates on a platform of climate action. Vote Compass has already told us that more Australians mentioned climate change as their number one issue than any other topic. We have taken Vote Compass data and examined all 151 electorates on the same issue. A higher proportion of voters in Liberal seats like Wentworth, Kooyong, Goldstein and Mackellar listed climate change as their most important issue – above the national mean. ABC election analyst Antony Green said Vote Compass data showed climate change cut across the usual left-right debate. ""If you look at the economy... at one end of the scale, you've got most of the Labor electorates, and at the other end, the Liberal electorates,"" he said. ""When you look at climate change and whether it's important, the electorates are all jumbled up on the same scale. ""You get lots of really strong Liberal urban electorates very high on the issue of climate change, and at the other end of the spectrum you get lots of rural electorates — but you also get lots of urban Labor electorates, which just shows climate change as an issue doesn't run in parallel to normal politics."" Green said this meant candidates like ""teal"" independents — mostly women taking on Coalition MPs in wealthy electorates throughout Australia — had appeal with people who traditionally voted Liberal. ""What's going on in these Liberal electorates where teal independents are doing well is that if Labor or the Greens ran on the climate change agenda in the same way, the voters would still vote Liberal because Liberal voters view Labor and the Greens as having other left-wing views they don't find attractive,"" Green said. ""But for an independent to run on the issue entirely who's got other conservative credentials, then they are more attractive to voters who are traditionally Liberal voters who are attracted to getting a candidate who will do something with climate change."" In Tasmania, the Hobart seat of Clark has been held by independent Andrew Wilkie since 2010. Nyrelle Suhr, casting her vote ahead of May 21, said environment and climate change were among her top issues. ""Economy has a lot to do with it, people are losing their jobs, and COVID-19 has had a lot to do with things,"" she said. Another Clark voter said he was casting his vote based on ""stability in the economy"". ""Somebody who's got an idea of how to actually run this country, not pulling ideas out of a hat that appears to me to be coming forward from one party,"" he said. Teal independents have also been campaigning for a federal anti-corruption commission. The second most salient issue among independent voters was government accountability, with 16 per cent of people saying it was their most important issue this election. In third was the environment, nominated by almost 10 per cent of independent voters.

43,The first snapshot of the cosmic monster in our galaxy opens up more questions than it answers,science," Science We've seen the black hole called Sagittarius A* at the middle of the Milky Way. Now what? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog There's a monster twirling around in the centre of our galaxy, and its portrait has finally been unveiled. Overnight, the international Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) crew revealed an image of superheated gas coursing around and falling into Sagittarius A* or Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the Milky Way's core. It's the culmination of five years of simulations and data crunching. And while it might look a bit like a glazed donut, there's more to the new image than meets the eye. For one, it tells us the black hole is 4 million times the mass of the Sun — a figure physicists suspected, but is now confirmed. The black hole's spinning too, but it’s skew-whiff — slightly tilted face-on to us. But despite this veritable goldmine of information about our galaxy's black hole, there's still plenty we're yet to discover. Well, for one, it's our supermassive black hole. ""It's home,"" said Jessica Dempsey, an Australian astrophysicist and member of the EHT team. We've now had a look at the supermassive black hole in the middle of the Milky Way. But how did we know it was there at all? ""That's why this one is special to a lot of people. The hunt to understand what is going on at the centre of our galaxy is hundreds of years old."" And while it may not be the biggest black hole, Sgr A*'s proximity means it's our best bet for understanding how it and its counterparts behave. ""As our instruments on the ground and in space improve our understanding, the Milky Way black hole is going to go a long way to unpacking general relativity, and how that works with quantum mechanics,"" said Dr Dempsey, former deputy director of the East-Asia Observatory in Hawaii. Understanding more about the Milky Way’s hefty heart can give clues as to how our galaxy formed. ""And maybe what we can learn from Sgr A* we can start to look for … in other galaxies,"" she said. One of the biggest ongoing questions in black hole physics is exactly how they collect, ingest and expel material orbiting them at near light speed in a process known as ""accretion"". After much hype and fanfare, we now know what the mega black hole in the centre of our galaxy looks like. This process is fundamental to the formation and growth of planets, stars and black holes of all sizes, throughout the universe. Despite the brightly spiralling gas and dust in the image, Sgr A* was not ""eating"" as much matter as the team had expected. ""If Sgr A* was a person, it would consume the equivalent of eating a grain of rice once every million years,"" said Michael Johnson, an astrophysicist at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. While some black holes can be remarkably efficient in converting gravitational energy into light, Sgr A* traps and hangs onto nearly all of this energy. ""It converts only one part in 1,000 into light,"" Dr Johnson said. And unlike the gargantuan black hole in the galaxy M87, an image of which was released in 2019, Sgr A* is not blasting enormous jets of X-ray energy into space. But it might have a weak jet, Dr Dempsey said, based on as-yet unexplained peculiarities in how it rotates and accretes matter. If a jet is indeed there, the EHT can't yet see it, but research published late last year suggests a weak jet might be present. While the EHT was gazing at the black hole, three X-ray telescopes kept an eye on it too. They spotted X-ray flares — or outbursts — from Sgr A*. Signs of a jet? Perhaps. James Miller-Jones, an astrophysicist at Curtin University and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, said measuring the polarised light thrown off by the black hole's surroundings would tell us about its magnetic field. It's something the EHT team reported, last year, about M87. ""Sgr A* seems to have a strong, dynamically significant magnetic field, which means it's a magnetic field strong enough to affect the motion of the plasma around the black hole,"" Professor Miller-Jones said. ""It's going to be very interesting to look at that magnetic field structure and how that's influenced by the black hole, particularly given that it's spinning."" Alister Graham, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University of Technology, hoped to find out just how fast Sgr A*'s spin was. ""Black holes can spin at significant fractions of the speed of light, but I sensed [the EHT team] was unable to get an accurate read on this."" Another mystery that's yet to be solved is pinpointing the launch site of plasma jets that blew up the colossal twin bubbles in the Milky Way, he added. So how will we answer these questions? First, let's look at how astrophysicists managed to peek through a cosmic curtain of stars and gas to the black hole within our galaxy. Over a handful of nights in April 2017, when skies were clear, eight observatories from Antarctica to Europe simultaneously focused their gaze onto the centre of our galaxy, each tuned to record light with a wavelength of 1.3 millimetres. These are radio waves — invisible to our eyes, but spat out in abundance by the incredibly hot, turbulent gas swirling around and falling into the black hole, which produces the donut-like image. Because the EHT observatories were separated by vast distances, each telescope received the same radio signals from the Milky Way's centre at slightly different times. Each radio signal data point was ""stamped"" at its telescope by an atomic clock so precise that over the course of 100 million years, it would lose only a second. When it was time to combine the data, these time stamps let physicists synchronise the slew of signals and generate a sharper image. This linked-telescope technique, called Very Long Baseline Interferometry, essentially produces a telescope the size of the planet — and one with a resolution so high, it could, in theory, spot a ping pong ball on the surface of the Moon. So how can it be improved? Funny you should ask … The EHT has been training its radio-ready eyes on Sgr A* again — and on yet more objects — in the years since its first observations in 2017. More observatories have joined the EHT network since, which is already making a ""really huge"" difference, Dr Dempsey said. More ""eyes"" means the EHT can collect more light, increasing its sensitivity and its ability to spot fainter features. ""The more elements we bring in, the more sensitive we become, and the more certain we can be of fitting what we see … to the model,"" Dr Dempsey said. ""And the most critical part for Sgr A* is we can do those snapshots faster."" This means the team will eventually be able to take images on timescales they need to produce a movie that captures dynamic features such as the rotation of the black hole, and the gases tumbling around it. ""We really need to make a movie of our black hole to start to understand a lot of the questions [we still have],"" Dr Dempsey said. Already, the EHT has a spatial resolution some 5,000 times better than the Hubble Space Telescope, giving the EHT a ""whopping improvement"" in the ability to spy objects at vast distances, Professor Graham said. But to make out finer details, we'll need more telescopes. Not on Earth, though. ""Having a radio telescope in space will offer further gains in resolution, as will having one on the Moon,"" Professor Graham said. That's because the further apart the network's telescopes are, the better their spatial resolution is. Plans are afoot to send a 10-metre-wide radio telescope dish some 1.5 million kilometres into space, where the gravitational tug of Earth and the Sun will hold it in place. When incorporated into the Earth-based network, the telescope — called the Millimetron Space Observatory — should give the EHT a 150-fold improvement in resolution. The mission is led by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and is, so far, slated for launch in 2030. Tuning the EHT's radio dishes to pick up light of different wavelengths will give astrophysicists different representations of the black hole too. Detecting shorter wavelengths — less than a millimetre — should provide a sharper view through our galaxy's disc, Professor Miller-Jones said. Comparing the brightness of the black hole's gassy ring at different wavelengths — say, if it appears brighter in one wavelength than the other — could reveal some of its physical processes. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. ""With the next generation [EHT] facility, it will be very exciting to test our models of the environment around the black hole, and what we understand about the processes of how gas flows around it,"" Professor Miller-Jones said. ""All of that will be very, very interesting in the years to come."" So there will be, no doubt, plenty more never-before-seen insights into some of the most mysterious phenomena in the universe — including our galaxy's black hole. ""I personally love results that open up more questions than answers — and this [new image] is definitely one of those,"" Dr Dempsey said. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

44,"'Holy cow, plants can grow in lunar soil': Scientists reveal hope for life on the Moon",science,"  Plants grow in lunar soil for the first time, as NASA plans for life on the Moon Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Scientists have used lunar soil collected during Apollo missions to grow plants for the first time. The results have been deemed promising enough that NASA is envisioning hothouses on the Moon for the next generation of lunar explorers. Researchers from the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences last year planted thale cress in soil collected by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and other astronauts. All the seeds sprouted but the plants ended up stunted, scientists revealed in results published on Thursday. The team of experts said they were initially dubious but are now planning to repeat the experiment with greater success. ""For their first week or so of life, there was really no difference between the controls and the lunar plant, so there wasn't something inherently toxic to the plants in lunar regolith [soil] that would prevent plants from growing,"" said University of Florida biologist and geneticist Anna-Lisa Paul. ""So everything else downstream is how can we mitigate any negative responses. That was the start and the positive spin on all of this."" The research could have implications for NASA astronauts heading to the Moon in coming years. ""That was the first step in what's going to hopefully be a very long, multi-decade process of figuring this stuff out and when we get back to the Moon, doing it on the lunar surface,"" University of Florida geologist Stephen Elardo said. His University of Florida colleague Robert Ferl said the team's first thought was: ""Holy cow, plants can grow in lunar soil.""

45,"University of Queensland confirms plans to leave Dayboro vet clinic, seeks new operator",science,"  University of Queensland to leave Dayboro vet clinic, seeks new operator Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The University of Queensland has confirmed plans to shift all veterinary teaching to Gatton, closing its long-running specialist veterinary training clinic at Dayboro. The university announced plans to close the 34-year-old Dayboro vet clinic, north of Brisbane, late last year. The move sparked concerns from regional cattle farmers that they would be left without accredited cattle vets close by, with the only other clinic about an hour and a half drive from Dayboro. UQ agreed to postpone the original closure slated for March and enter into a longer consultation period with local farmers, students and the industry. On Thursday, UQ School of Veterinary Science head Professor Nigel Perkins said in a statement that the university had made the ""difficult decision to seek a new operator for the Dayboro Veterinary Clinic to ensure it can continue to serve the local community"". ""We will be identifying a new operator through an expression of interest process, which is expected to take until the end of September,"" Professor Perkins said. National Tertiary Education Union UQ branch president Andrew Bonnell said the closure would see nine continuing staff made redundant and six casual positions discontinued. In 2012, UQ closed its small animal clinic at St Lucia and in 2013, invested $2.4 million in upgrading its Dayboro facilities. A petition was launched protesting the proposed closure late last year, garnering thousands of signatures, triggering a town hall meeting with UQ representatives and the Dayboro community. Professor Perkins said veterinary science and veterinary technology teaching will move from Dayboro to Gatton, west of Brisbane. ""The decision has not been made lightly and the University is genuinely committed to supporting staff, students and our valued customers through this process,"" Professor Perkins said. The university will cease operations at Dayboro on June 30, but with the expression of interest process continuing into September for a new clinic operator, UQ said it would ""continue to support the clinic operating"".

46,"How turning off lights helps shearwater fledglings embark on 15,000km migration north",science,"  Lights go out on Phillip Island to aid shearwater fledglings on their migration to Alaska Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Businesses on Phillip Island have been turning out their lights at night to help prevent shearwater fledglings from becoming disorientated as they embark on their annual migration to Alaska — a 15,000-kilometre journey. As part of the 'Dark skies so shearwaters fly' campaign, 23 businesses turned off their lights in the evening so shearwaters taking off from breeding colonies on the island, 140 kilometres south of Melbourne, did not become distracted. Phillip Island Nature Parks deputy research manager, Duncan Sutherland, said the campaign was aimed at saving the birds, which tended to fly towards lights and land, often on roads. ""Artificial lights pose a real threat to the fledglings,"" he said. ""When they do land on roads, they run the very real risk of being struck by motorists, which obviously is not very good for their chances of successfully migrating, but also causes a danger to motorists as well."" The last of the shearwaters, which Mr Sutherland said were vital to the island's ecology, took off at the weekend, when the winds were up. Westernport Water communications and engagement manager Geoff Russell said the initiative was important to the island's businesses and residents. ""It’s about community. I’ve personally had to pick a few chicks off the road. You know each year to sort of do our bit,"" Mr Russell said. ""As a resident and local business, we're all in this together, we live alongside the wildlife on this beautiful island."" The staff and volunteers at Phillip Island Nature Parks have also participated in rescue missions as part of this project to save as many shearwater chicks as possible. ""There are staff and volunteers from the nature parks that remove those fledglings before they get hit by motorists,"" Mr Sutherland said. ""We've had lots of support from VicRoads, who have helped by turning lights off on the bridge that connects Phillip Island to the mainland."" Mr Sutherland stressed how important it was for park rangers and communities to protect the shearwater species into the future. ""As the environment changes, they're also going to change so all the incredible influence that they have on islands and marine systems are likely to change too,"" he said. Every year the shearwaters — also known as mutton birds — make a 15,000km journey from the northern hemisphere to breeding sites in Victoria and Bass Strait. Then, once the fledglings are strong enough, the great migration north begins. This year shearwater fledglings had to wait for strong westerly winds to help them on their journey to Alaska. Due to the length of their migratory route, the birds have developed a very efficient flying technique that relies on very strong winds. ""What they're doing is using the winds that push across the oceans, it's the waves that push the winds up … and the fledglings use that uplift to keep them up,"" Mr Sutherland said. He said the shearwaters were an essential part of Phillip Island's ecology as well as providing great opportunities for monitoring and research for the nature parks' researchers. ""They actually bring lots of nutrients from the oceans, and when they come to land, they deposit a lot of those nutrients and that forms really important things like some of the vegetation communities,"" he said. ""They have the fifth largest impact amongst the sea birds in terms of their role in as a predator in the marine environment,"" he said.

47,Our black hole might be a monster — but it's dwarfed by M87,science," Science Black hole images: First look at Sagittarius A* at heart of Milky Way revealed by Event Horizon Telescope Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Scientists have captured the first image of the monster black hole lurking at the heart of our galaxy. The black hole, known as Sagittarius A* or Sgr A*, lies 27,000 light-years from the Sun. All our previous knowledge about the supermassive black hole were based on indirect measurements of stars looping around the galactic centre, snared in its gravitational grip. ""Until now we didn't have the direct picture confirming Sgr A* was indeed a black hole,"" said Professor Feryal Özel of the University of Arizona. ""This is the first picture of the gentle giant at the centre of our galaxy."" The historic results were presented overnight in six papers published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Getting an image of our cosmic monster was ""not an easy journey"", Professor Özel said. ""It was extra challenging because … Sgr A* burbled and gurgled as we looked at it."" But the image confirms predictions that have been made by decades of work and proves yet again that Einstein's theory of general relativity was right. ""Because the size of a black hole shadow is proportional to its mass, our image tells us that the mass of Sgr A* is 4 million times greater than that of our Sun,"" said Sara Issaoun, an astrophysicist at Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Radboud University in the Netherlands. ""It is really incredible that this prediction from Einstein's theory of general relativity matches the mass measured by the Nobel Prize-winning studies of stellar orbits in our galactic centre."" But that's not to say there weren't some surprises. The first snapshots of Sgr A* were captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a planetary wide network of telescopes stretching from Antarctica to Europe. Capturing images of black holes is extremely challenging because the gravitational pull at the centre of a black hole is so strong that not even light can escape. But the EHT can see the light beamed out by super-hot gas swirling around the edge of the black hole's disc. In 2019, the EHT released the first-ever images of the swirling mass of superheated dust and gas surrounding a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy 53 million light-years away called M87. But the two black holes are very different. At around 4 million times the mass of our Sun, Sgr A* is much smaller than M87, which weighs in at around 6.5 billion times the mass of our Sun. And it is much more dynamic than M87, changing on the scale of hours, rather than months. That makes it very challenging to take an image of, said Katie Bouman of Caltech. ""Its appearance can change from minute to minute."" But the power of the telescope and the team's careful analysis meant the image was incredibly precise — even though it looks like a bit of a fuzzy smudge. ""It looks blurry on the screen because you're only seeing a few pixels — but it's actually one of the sharpest images you've ever seen."" The image shows a face-on view of a cosmic monster, said Michael Johnson, an astrophysicist at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. ""Even though we are peering through the galaxy, it's actually tilted towards us,"" Dr Johnson said. We've now had a look at the supermassive black hole in the middle of the Milky Way. But how did we know it was there at all? To figure this out, scientists ran copious computer simulations of what Sgr A* should look like depending on different spin inclinations, then compared them to the real deal. ""I'm impressed by the multitude of simulations to find the correct description of our galaxy's black hole,"" said Alister Graham, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University of Technology. It might seem strange that a supermassive black hole would rotate in a different plane to its galaxy, but it makes sense when you think about how black holes feed, said James Miller-Jones, an astrophysicist at Curtin University and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research. The middle of the Milky Way is dominated by a huge bulge of stars surrounding the black hole. And if a star strays too close to Sgr A* and gets ripped apart and dragged in, or some of the gas blown off by those stars falls in, that matter transfers some angular momentum to the black hole. ""If you have an ice skater, and they're twirling around slowly, and someone throws them a metal object and they catch it, that will give them some extra momentum in that direction,"" Professor Miller-Jones said. ""It's the same with gas — as it falls into the black hole, it gets it to spin a little bit faster in that direction. ""And because this [gas] is coming in from all directions, the black hole's spin is gradually changed by small amounts."" Black holes also grow by merging with other black holes, which can happen when galaxies collide. Such mergers would result in a black hole with a spin that combined the spins of the two initial black holes, Professor Miller-Jones added. While the images confirm many predictions, there were also some surprises. Despite the brightly spiralling gas and dust in the image, Sgr A* was not actually ""eating"" as much matter as the team had expected, Professor Özel said. ""It turned out to be a gentler, more cooperative black hole than we'd hoped for during our decade of simulating its environment,"" she said. Sgr A* traps only a few times the energy of our Sun, Dr Johnson said. ""Sgr A* is the view of a standard black hole. It's quiet. Sgr A* is exciting because it is common."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. The images don't match the simulations previously done by the team, said Jess Dempsey, an Australian astrophysicist who is part of the EHT team. ""The simulations that our amazing teams have done predict more variability than what we see in the data,"" said Dr Dempsey, former director of the East Asia Observatory in Hawaii, one of the telescopes in the EHT. ""We had a very good match with M87, we don't see that here. So something else is going on. ""We are starting to see suggestions in the rotation and how it eats and accretes its mass into itself that we don't understand yet,"" added Dr Dempsey, who is now the director of ASTRON in the Netherlands. She said the work was just the beginning of our understanding of what is going on with the black hole lurking in the middle of our galaxy ""This is our first, really quick snapshot of something deep and complex,"" she said.

48,We fact checked Morrison and Albanese at the third leaders' debate. Here's what we found,science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Fact checking Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese in the third leaders' debate Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The third leaders' debate on the Seven Network on Wednesday night was a much more subdued affair than the fiery, more shouty clash between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese on Sunday. But in politics, less shouting doesn't necessarily mean fewer furphies. It only means they are uttered at a lower volume. And so it was in the third meeting of the two leaders before the election. RMIT ABC Fact Check has rounded up some of the key claims where the leaders got their facts straight, and where they missed the mark. Hoping to score points on economic equality for women, both men took swings at their opponent's records. ""The gender pay gap has fallen from 17.4 per cent under Labor to 13.8 per cent where it is now,"" Mr Morrison claimed. ""It even went down to 13.4 per cent."" Mr Albanese, meanwhile, opted for an international comparison. ""Australia has fallen to 70th in the world for women's economic participation and opportunity,"" he noted. Both claims, however, lack some important context. Figures from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency do indeed show that the pay gap in Australia (the difference in average full time earnings for men and women) is currently 13.8 per cent, was as low as 13.4 per cent in early 2021, and was recorded at 17.4 per cent when Labor left office in 2013. But those figures hide an increase in the gender pay gap when the Coalition first came to power: Fact Check found in 2018 that the gap had grown to 18.5 per cent by November 2014. In 2018, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, as well as a number of other Coalition MPs, said that the gender pay gap had fallen under the Coalition. Moreover, experts have previously told Fact Check that the gender pay gap is driven primarily by economic trends, rather than government policy, with a booming economy leading to a larger gap and a stagnating economy causing the gap to narrow. This is because men are more highly concentrated in industries more susceptible to the highs and lows of the economic cycle, such as mining, and would see their wages grow at a slower rate compared to women's during economic downturns (or faster during booms). Mr Albanese's claim, meanwhile, appears to refer to a World Economic Forum report which ranks countries based on the women's economic participation and opportunity. Australia's 2021 ranking, the latest available, aligns with the Opposition Leader's claim. In 2018, former Australian Human Rights commission president Emeritus Professor Gillian Triggs said that Australia's gender gap has regressed in the world rankings over the past six or eight years. Placing 70th of 156 countries, this rank represents an ongoing slip for Australia, which ranked 49th in 2020, 46th in 2018 and 42nd in 2017. It's important to note, however, the WEF report focuses on measuring gaps in access to resources and opportunities rather than actual levels of available resources and opportunities in countries. As one expert told Fact Check in 2018, the WEF report was ""useful for rhetorical purposes"" but may not be ""telling us much about the absolute or objective reality of lives in each country"". Another noted that countries with low levels of absolute achievement could do well in the rankings if the gap between men and women was small. That said, the experts also acknowledged that gender equality in Australia had regressed. Issues of integrity in politics entered the debate when the two leaders found themselves in an argument over the government's proposed model for a federal anti-corruption commission. Mr Morrison argued the government's proposed model for its Commonwealth Integrity Commission released last year had the ""powers of a royal commission"" including ""powers of search, powers compelling witnesses"". In a previous investigation Fact Check found a claim by Social Services Minister Anne Ruston that the Coalition's model boasted powers ""well in excess of a royal commission"" to be overblown. While the new body would have some powers comparable to those of a royal commission — including powers to enter and search premises and compel witnesses to testify, as suggested by Mr Morrison — there are other significant differences between the two. Fact Check found the Royal Commissions Act was relatively brief, leaving scope for commissioners to use their powers broadly. In contrast, the much longer draft bill to establish the CIC imposed many constraints, including how investigations could be initiated and carried out. In particular, there were significant limitations on the powers in the proposed ""public sector division"", covering most of the public service, parliamentarians, higher education providers and research bodies. In this division, the CIC would lack the power to hold public hearings — a function that legal experts told Fact Check increased the effectiveness of royal commissions and contributed to their investigative ability. There are also limitations in the public sector division on what types of conduct can be investigated, who can be investigated and how much of its work can be reported publicly, in contrast to royal commissions. Experts told Fact Check that these restrictions undercut the new body's powers in a way that did not apply to royal commissions. They also pointed out that the CIC would have less ability than a royal commission to exercise the powers it did have, because its proposed annual budget fell well below the cost of many single-issue royal commissions. In response to Mr Morrison's claims about the powers of the proposed CIC, Mr Albanese argued it needed to be ""independent of politics"" saying that under the government's model ""ministers would decide"" whether something was referred to the new body. As explained in Fact Check's assessment of Senator Ruston's claim, the Coalition's proposal would see the CIC split into two divisions. Social Services Minister Anne Ruston says the government's model for a federal integrity commission has powers ""well in excess"" of a royal commission. Is that correct? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. As mentioned above, the ""public sector integrity division"" would investigate parliamentarians, the public service, higher education providers and other Commonwealth entities The ""law enforcement integrity division"" on the other hand would have jurisdiction over certain federal law enforcement agencies, such as the federal police, as well as public sector agencies with investigative functions, like the Department of Home Affairs. Under sections 33 to 36 of the exposure draft, referrals in the public sector division can only be made by certain individuals including the Attorney-General, the responsible minister for the agency investigated, Commonwealth Integrity Office Holders and certain parliamentarians. Meanwhile, under section 44, investigations in the law enforcement division can be referred by anyone — including members of the public. Associate professor and deputy director of the Australian Centre for Justice Innovation at Monash University Yee-Fui Ng previously told Fact Check there were significant constraints on the referral process in the public sector division that prevented it from acting on tip-offs from the public or whistleblowers. ""The [public sector division of the] CIC has less powers than equivalent oversight bodies (such as the Ombudsman and Auditor-General) as it cannot conduct own-motion investigations or receive referrals directly from the public,"" she said. This issue was also raised by the Grattan Institute, The Law Council of Australia and the Australian Human Rights Commission in their responses to the exposure draft of the government's legislation. In an attack on Mr Albanese, Mr Morrison suggested his opponent ""doesn't think through"" his policies. ""He has got a housing policy where if you get a wage rise you've got to sell your house,"" Mr Morrison said. But that's not quite correct. Labor's Help to Buy scheme would see the government own as much as a 40 per cent stake in homes bought by qualifying low-to-moderate-income earners, who would need to contribute only 60 per cent of the purchase price. If elected, Labor would make the scheme available to up to 10,000 home buyers per year whose annual income is less than $90,000 (for singles) and $120,000 (for couples). According to the policy on Labor's website: ""If the homebuyer's income exceeds the Help to Buy gross annual income threshold for two consecutive years, they will be required to repay the Government's financial contribution in part or whole as their circumstances permit."" Labor's policy does not detail how long buyers would have to repay the government, nor does it stipulate that a house would need to be sold in order to make the repayments. Additionally, Shadow Finance Minister Richard Marles has explained that the policy is directed at long-term low-to-moderate income earners who otherwise ""face a lifetime of renting"", rather than those expected to see large increases in income. Mr Albanese sought to connect action on climate change with lower electricity prices, claiming: ""Renewables are the cheapest form of new energy."" In 2019, Fact Check tested a similar claim from former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who tweeted that ""renewables + storage are cheaper than new coal let alone … nuclear power."" In 2018, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said new generation from renewables plus storage is cheaper than new coal or nuclear generation. That claim was found to be a fair call. The verdict was based on a 2018 report released by the national science agency CSIRO and the energy market operator AEMO. The report was part of the GenCost project, ""the result of a collaboration between CSIRO and AEMO, together with stakeholder input, to deliver an annual process of updating electricity generation costs"". The lead author Paul Graham, who is the CSIRO's chief energy economist, said when the report was released: ""Our data confirms that while existing fossil fuel power plants are competitive due to their sunk capital costs, solar and wind generation technologies are currently the lowest-cost ways to generate electricity for Australia, compared to any other new-build technology. ""At a global level, the investment costs of a wide range of low emission generation technologies are projected to continue to fall, and we found new-build renewable generation to be least cost, including when we add the cost of two or six hours of energy storage to wind and solar."" The latest update of the report was released at the end of 2021. Upon its release, the CSIRO said: ""The latest 2021-22 report confirmed past years' findings that solar and wind are cheapest, even when considering their additional integration costs such as storage and transmission."" The project calculates the ""levelised cost of energy"" (LCOE) for generating new power, for example, building a new coal-fired power plant or a wind farm. ""LCOE converts all costs into annual operating costs (i.e. capital costs are amortised into equivalent annual payments), adds them together and divides them by annual output in energy terms, typically MWhs,"" the 2018 report said. It added that LCOE ""needs to be extended in light of the greater emphasis on variable renewables in the electricity system and their additional balancing costs which are not captured by LCOE calculations"". Leading experts consulted by Fact Check at the time pointed out that new coal-fired power plants would most likely be required to accept a ""risk premium"" when obtaining finance, reflecting uncertainty over international and domestic climate and energy policy, future clean-up costs, and higher construction risks. According to some estimates, interest rates faced by new coal projects as a consequence would be twice those applying to wind or solar projects. Factoring this in makes new coal a less attractive proposition. Data supplied to Fact Check by the CSIRO in 2019 confirmed that even when incorporating the cost of storage, renewables were cheaper for new power generation than coal when incorporating this risk premium, as well as small scale nuclear. A graph taken from the most recent report similarly shows solar and wind well underneath all other non-renewables for LCOE in 2021. Mr Morrison boasted of his government's response to COVID-19, arguing Australia had done well despite ""a pandemic where the economic impacts have been 30 times worse than what occurred in the global financial crisis just over a decade ago"" . Fact Check looked at this claim in 2021, finding Mr Morrison was comparing apples and oranges, with experts arguing that his approach was not the normal way of assessing two economic periods. Justifying a big-spending budget, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Parliament that coronavirus had ""raged through the developed world and is now raging through the developing world"" in a far more devastating way than the global financial crisis. In fact, they said his claim was confusing, misleading and most likely wrong, while noting that the two recessions were fundamentally different in nature. Experts also told Fact Check that, although the final numbers were not yet in, they expected that an orthodox comparison would reveal the pandemic downturn of 2020 to be twice the magnitude of the GFC, or possibly similar. When it came to jobs and skills, Mr Morrison repeated a furphy that his government was ""providing record numbers of apprenticeships"". That claim is in the ballpark in nominal terms, but as Fact Check has pointed out previously it says little about the current situation relative to previous years, given population changes. When Mr Morrison says ""record numbers"", Fact Check takes him to be repeating his recent, clearer claim that there were ""more apprentices in trade training today, 220,000 of them, than we have had since records began in 1963"". Things look very different when the numbers are viewed as rates that take population into account, for example, as a share of the employed population or of the working age population (aged 15-64). In 2021, apprentices made up 1.6 per cent of the employed population compared with a peak of 2.3 per cent in 1982. And they made up 1.3 per cent of the working age population compared with 1.5 per cent in 1974. It's also worth noting that apprentice numbers have been significantly boosted by temporary pandemic-era wage subsidies since 2020, having previously fallen by 27,000 over the Coalition's first seven years. Mr Morrison included Medicare bulk-billing rates in a list of reasons to vote for the Coalition. ""Bulk billing at 88.8 per cent. It's up from 82.2 when we first came to government."" While Mr Morrison did not specify whether he was referring to all services covered by Medicare or just GP visits, his comment aligns with the rate of GP services bulk billed — 88.8 per cent — in the 2020-21 financial year. The bulk billing rate for all Medicare services in 2020-21 was 81 per cent. At the end of Labor's last full financial year in office, 2012-13, the rate of GP services bulk billed was 82.2 per cent and for all Medicare services was 76.5 per cent. However, as Fact Check has pointed out previously, these statistics refer to the proportion of services bulk billed, not the number of patients. In its 2020 Health of the Nation report, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners explained that patients could receive a number of services during a single visit to a GP, with some of these services bulk-billed and others billed privately. Additionally, experts have previously explained to Fact Check that some groups of people are more likely to be bulk billed, such as concession card holders, visit the GP more often than those who aren't bulk billed. This means that the rate of bulk-billed services does not directly translate to the bulk-billing rate for individuals. The Health of the Nation Report noted that in 2018-19, 86 per cent of GP services were bulk billed, but only 66 per cent of patients had all their GP services bulk billed. Asked a question about how productivity could be increased, Mr Albanese attacked the government's record on economic management. ""There's nothing productive about doubling the debt before the pandemic that occurred,"" Mr Albanese said. As Fact Check has previously found, the dollar value of government debt had indeed doubled, in nominal terms, under the Coalition over the years to January 2020. Official monthly data shows that gross debt had grown $280.3 billion to $568.1 billion (103 per cent) since the 2013 election, while net debt — which better reflects the government's capacity to pay its debt — had risen from $174.6 billion to $430.2 billion (146 per cent). A fairer comparison would, however, also take into account the size of the economy, which accounts for the passage of time and inflation. Data from the 2022-23 budget, which is produced on a financial year basis, doesn't align neatly with electoral dates or the start of the pandemic. It shows that between June 2013, three months before the Coalition was elected, and June 2019, seven months before the pandemic, gross debt as a share of GDP grew by 65 per cent, and net debt by 85 per cent.

49,"Creator of the world famous Pink Lady apple, West Australian John Cripps, dies aged 95 ",science," ABC Rural Pink Lady and Sundowner-Joya apple creator, West Australian John Cripps, dies aged 95 Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A Western Australian man known across the globe as the breeder of the Pink Lady apple, John Cripps, has died at the age 95. He has been described by those that knew him as a quiet gentleman who was passionate and dedicated to the art of plant breeding. The British-Australian horticulturalist carried out his research in WA's Department of Agriculture. Mr Cripps' name also adorns another of his cultivars, the Cripps Red — a late-season variety of the Pink Lady marketed as the Sundowner and Joya. He was formally recognised in 2010 when inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Royal Agricultural Society of Western Australia for his influence on Australia's apple industry. Mr Cripps was also named an Officer in the Order of Australia in 2015 for his ""distinguished service to primary industry through internationally renowned, innovative contributions to the agriculture and food sectors, and to the community"". Mr Cripp's daughter, Helen Cripps, said the family was proud of his contribution to horticulture in Australia. ""We are so proud that he's left a legacy,"" Dr Cripps said. ""It took 25 years of research to develop the apple genetics of the Pink Lady to the point it's at today."" Since its release in 1991, the Pink Lady variety has become internationally recognised as a success story, listed in the top 100 greatest inventions from Australia. In 2015, the Cripps Pink — the cultivar of the apple sold under the trademark name Pink Lady — accounted for more than 30 per cent of Australian apple production. Prominent Manjimup producer and Newton Orchards owner Harvey Giblett said he had the pleasure of working with John Cripps over the years. ""I always found him very calm and quiet, but beneath that he was quite determined and dedicated in what he was doing,"" he said. ""As a Pink Lady grower I'm proud that the variety was bred right here in WA. ""It's pretty amazing, really, because he's created a world-class apple. ""Even to this day it's still growing in popularity around the world."" Australian Pear and Apples Ltd CEO Phil Turnbull said Mr Cripps made an enormous contribution to the apple industry, both in Australia and internationally. ""John’s painstaking work produced an apple that has become one of the most successful and best loved apples worldwide,"" he said. Internationally, Pink Lady apples are grown and consumed from South Africa, Chile, and New Zealand to North America and Europe. Mr Turnbull said the decision to market Cripps Pink under the Pink Lady brand had also changed the face of apple marketing. ""John leaves behind an incredible legacy, and we thank him for it,"" Mr Turnbull said.

50," A 'fig leaf' for fossil fuels:  Coalition's 'clean' hydrogen plans nothing but greenwashing, critics say ",science,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Plans by the federal government to develop a ""clean"" hydrogen industry in Australia have been branded greenwashing by critics who say taxpayer money is being used to subsidise fossil fuel activities. The government has announced plans for a series of hydrogen hubs around the country as part of efforts to kickstart production of the fuel and decarbonise the economy. About $500 million has been earmarked for hydrogen hubs for industrial centres in places including Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and Tasmania. But the spending has drawn fire amid claims much of the money would be invested in so-called blue hydrogen, which is made using natural gas rather than renewable energy. The Australia Institute, a left-leaning think-tank, argued the funding defeated the purpose of building a hydrogen industry. The institute's climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said clean hydrogen could ""be one of two things"". ""You can make it using renewable energy, which is a zero-emissions process,"" Mr Merzian said. ""Or you can make it using fossil fuels, which is a really dirty process."" Climate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley backed the concept behind hydrogen hubs, which were aimed at putting producers of the fuel alongside big users such as industrial customers. But Mr Buckley described as greenwashing the government's support for blue hydrogen, which he said was a ""fig leaf"" to hide the continuation of the natural gas industry. The former investment banker said producing hydrogen from gas instead of renewable energy made no sense. It's been identified as the clean energy source that could help bring the world to net-zero emissions, but green hydrogen's future is not yet assured. ""At the end of the day, if you are going to make hydrogen from fossil fuels, you might as well just use the fossil fuels,"" Mr Buckley said. ""Why go through the extra processing steps, the extra cost, to use hydrogen? ""You might as well just use the gas, the coal, the electricity in the first place."" As well as providing financial support for blue hydrogen, the Coalition has also thrown its weight behind carbon capture and storage projects around the country. Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the technology would be vital if Australia — and the world more broadly — were to become carbon neutral in the coming decades. Mr Taylor said carban capture and storage had the backing of the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, noting there were ""just under 30 projects in production"" worldwide. He also defended the government's support of blue hydrogen prospects, insisting the process could help reduce Australia’s emissions. ""You've got to remember the objective of the exercise here is to reduce emissions, not destroy industries,"" Mr Taylor said. ""Now it is true there are activists out there that would like to destroy our traditional industries, whether it's agriculture, resources. ""They want to see the end of those industries. We don't."" Mr Buckley said the fact that blue hydrogen relied on burying carbon emissions underground should be a red flag for government. He claimed the technology had failed despite decades of trying by industry, and pointed to the problems that had plagued the carbon capture storage project at the $US54 billion Gorgon gas project off WA's north-west coast. Mr Buckley said it made no sense to be talking about blue hydrogen given commercial-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage had not actually worked. ""The government and the fossil fuel industry has been so effective at undermining the key enabler of carbon capture and storage, which is a carbon price,"" Mr Buckley said. ""In the absence of a carbon price, the whole idea of blue hydrogen is to put a fig leaf on the whole idea that methane gas has somehow got a path to decarbonisation."" Part of Australia's net zero by 2050 plan is to use carbon capture and storage to help get emissions down. But is it a realistic option? Mr Merzian agreed and also took aim at government assistance for a number of carbon capture and utilisation — otherwise known as enhanced oil recovery — projects in which carbon is pumped into reservoirs to extract more oil and gas. He said such support, along with money for blue hydrogen and carbon capture storage, amounted to the subsidisation of the oil and gas industry by taxpayers. At the same time, he said, oil and gas producers around the world were posting multi-billion-dollar profits as energy prices soared to all-time highs. ""Going down the pathway of fossil-fuel-based hydrogen is really dangerous because it's unlikely you're going to bury those emissions and you might just end up with more,"" Mr Merzian said. ""Carbon capture and storage has been a colossal failure."" He said its only benefit was in ""pretending we can continue to use fossil fuels in the hope that somehow we will be able to bury the problem"". ""It makes it all the more ridiculous when you have an actual opportunity to invest in a zero-emissions production process for hydrogen and it's available right now,"" he said. Mr Taylor dismissed the criticisms and said the government wanted to keep its options open as the country moved towards net zero by 2050. He said ""every technology that's available should be in the mix"" and highlighted how the government was spending $22 billion on different solutions to cut Australia's carbon output. Climate change is being buried this election. So we asked some of Australia's leading climate scientists for their verdict on how the major parties' policies stack up. ""There are some who would like the portfolio to be a minimal set of technologies and in the process destroy traditional industries,"" Mr Taylor said. He said the government was focused on having the broadest range of technologies available. ""This is a difficult job. It's made more difficult if you exclude technologies that have real potential,"" Mr Taylor said. ""Our focus is on the projects, not the companies."" Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association deputy chief executive Damian Dwyer said the industry was committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 and noted it had already spent $5 billion on decarbonisation initiatives. Mr Dwyer said technologies such as carbon capture and storage would be ""critically important"" in helping Australia meet its goals. He said Australia was particularly well-placed to use carbon capture storage, suggesting the country had ""known high-quality, stable geological storage basins, existing infrastructure, world-class technical expertise and regulatory regimes"". ""In a similar way, natural gas is a pathway to a large-scale and innovative commercial hydrogen industry,"" Mr Dwyer said. ""An Australian hydrogen industry and a local market could generate significant opportunities for the country."" He said Australia's upstream oil and gas industry was well placed to assist in the development of a large-scale and innovative commercial hydrogen industry.

51,One in three people are infected with this parasite – and the clue could be in your eyes,science,"  One in three people are infected with Toxoplasma parasite – and the clue could be in our eyes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Toxoplasma gondii is probably the most successful parasite in the world today. This microscopic creature is capable of infecting any mammal or bird, and people across all continents are infected. Once infected, a person carries Toxoplasma for life. So far, we don't have a drug that can eradicate the parasite from the body. And there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. Across the world, it's estimated 30–50 per cent of people are infected with Toxoplasma — and infections may be increasing in Australia. A survey of studies conducted at blood banks and pregnancy clinics across the country in the 1970s put the infection rate at 30 per cent. However, a recent Western Australian community-based study found 66 per cent of people were infected. The disease caused by this parasite can scar the back of the eye. Our new research looked for signs of disease in otherwise healthy people and found a significant number bore the mark of Toxoplasma. The cat is the primary host for Toxoplasma. Cats catch the parasite when they eat infected prey. Then, for a couple of weeks, they pass large numbers of parasites in their faeces in a form that can survive for long periods in the environment, even during extreme weather. When the faeces are ingested by livestock while grazing, parasites lodge in the muscle and survive there after the animals are slaughtered for meat. Humans can become infected by eating this meat, or by eating fresh produce or drinking water soiled by cats. It is also possible for a woman infected for the first time during pregnancy to pass the infection to her unborn child. While infection with Toxoplasma is extremely common, the most important health statistic is the rate of the disease caused by the infection, which is called toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma really likes the retina, the multi-layered nerve tissue that lines the eye and generates vision. Infection can cause recurring attacks of retinal inflammation and permanent retinal scarring. This is known as ocular toxoplasmosis. Contrary to much that is written about ocular toxoplasmosis, medical research shows this condition usually affects healthy adults. However, in aged persons or people with a weakened immune system, or when contracted during pregnancy, it can be more severe. An attack of active inflammation causes ""floaters"" and blurred vision. When the inflammation progresses to scarring, there may be permanent loss of vision. In a study of patients with ocular toxoplasmosis seen at a large ophthalmology clinic, we measured reduced vision to below driving level in more than 50 per cent of eyes, and 25 per cent of eyes were irreversibly blind. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are quite familiar with managing ocular toxoplasmosis. But the extent of the problem is not widely recognised, even by the medical community. The number of Australians with ocular toxoplasmosis had never been measured, until now. We wanted to investigate the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in Australia, but we knew it would be challenging to get funding for a major survey of this neglected disease. So, we used information collected for a different purpose: as part of the Busselton Healthy Ageing Study, retinal photographs were taken from more than 5,000 baby boomers (born 1946–64) living in Busselton, Western Australia. The photographs were gathered to look for other eye diseases, macular degeneration and glaucoma. By screening these retinal photographs, we estimated the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis at one in 150 Australians. This might seem surprisingly common, but it fits with the way people catch Toxoplasma. In addition to pet cats, Australia has huge populations of feral cats. And Australia is home to a lot of farmland, including over 50 per cent of the global organic farming area. Most importantly, many Australians like to eat their red meat rare, putting them at real risk. To diagnose ocular toxoplasmosis, a retina examination is necessary, ideally with the pupils dilated. The retinal lesion is easy to spot, because of the way Toxoplasma activates retinal cells to produce certain proteins, and an ophthalmologist or optometrist can immediately recognise the appearance. Often a blood test is also performed to make the diagnosis. If the condition is mild, the doctor may let the body's own immune system control the problem, which takes a few months. However, usually a combination of anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic drugs is prescribed. Toxoplasma infection is not curable, but it can be prevented. Meat sold in Australian supermarkets may harbour Toxoplasma. Cooking meat to an internal temperature of 66C or freezing it ahead of cooking are ways to kill the parasite. Fresh fruit and vegetables should be washed before eating, and drinking untreated water (such as straight from rivers or creeks) should be avoided. Gloves should be worn when changing cat litter, and hands washed afterwards. The World Health Organisation and other international and national health bodies are promoting an approach called One Health for diseases that cross humans, animals and their environments. This involves different sectors working together to promote good health. Now we know just how common ocular toxoplasmosis is in Australia, there is real justification to harness One Health to combat Toxoplasma infections in this country. Justine R.

52,'A lot of biblical events tend to happen': Sperm donor secrecy sees records unnecessarily withheld,science,"  Sperm-donor-conceived Queenslanders turn to DNA databases to track down biological fathers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog After years of desperately searching for their sperm-donor fathers, Queenslanders Kate Drysdale and Kerri Favarato used an ancestry DNA database and turned detective to find them. But as a Queensland Parliamentary committee prepares to investigate law reform around donor conception, both women hope the journey for others in their position — those conceived when sperm donation was cloaked in secrecy — is not as fraught. The women were conceived in different decades but with help from the same Brisbane fertility clinic. During multiple contacts with the clinic to request information about their biological fathers, they were separately told by different people at different times medical records may have been damaged by smoke and floods, or lost, or destroyed. ""A lot of Biblical events tend to happen within the record departments of fertility clinics,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""I don't mean to be facetious but so many donor-conceived people have been told that."" Having children of their own has intensified their desire to learn more about their biological heritage. Both women turned to science — and an American direct-to-consumer DNA testing company and database — to continue the search. So-called ancestry databases allow people to compare their own DNA against other publicly available genetic profiles to help them find blood relatives and to build a family tree. In the cases of Ms Drysdale, 30, and Ms Favarato, 39, it allowed them to identify their biological fathers even though neither man had registered a DNA sample on a consumer database at that time. Soon after giving birth to her daughter, Brisbane-based Ms Favarato spent five months of painstaking work piecing together her family tree after finding on a database a fourth cousin — a woman she shared great, great, great grandparents with. ""It was exhausting and really hard work but I needed it to be done,"" she said. ""I was so sick of going through the process of trying to find information and getting the door slammed in my face. ""I just went: 'This is my chance, I have to do this'."" By this stage, Ms Favarato had already spent about two decades looking. As a teenager, after learning her biological father had probably been a medical student, Ms Favarato accessed University of Queensland medical graduate records for the relevant years of the 1980s, making a list of potential candidates. ""I crossed out anyone that had an Asian or Indian sounding name and I crossed out all of the females,"" she said. ""Then I started writing letters to doctors, going: 'Are you my donor?'."" It came to nought. Years later, in February 2017, through DNA searches for blood relatives and hundreds of hours of detective work to develop her family tree, she finally had a match to a Brisbane doctor — Donald 'Digger' Whittaker. Impatient to speak to him, rather than write an email, she picked up the phone and dialled his clinic, leaving a message for him to return her call about ""a private family matter"". Within minutes, he called back. ""How do I know you?"" Dr Whittaker asked. ""Did you donate sperm in the 80s? I think you're my biological father,"" Ms Favarato replied. ""Oh my goodness. Hello darling. How are you? Tell me about yourself,"" Dr Whittaker answered. Five years on, they have what Ms Favarato describes as an ""undefinable"" relationship with ""reasonably regular"" contact. They visit each other's homes and she introduces him to people as ""my biological father"". ""He doesn't call me his daughter or anything like that,"" Ms Favarato said. ""We don't have the same relationship that I have with the dad who raised me. It's not like that, but it's an undeniable connection. ""We just don't bother labelling anything. It is what it is."" Kate Drysdale, who lives in Atherton, in Queensland's far north, with partner Andrew and their young son, has known she was donor-conceived since the age of seven. By then, her mother Carol and her non-biological father had divorced and he was no longer in their lives. ""My legal father and my mother disagreed as to whether or not I should be told. She'd always wanted me to know,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""She has a social work background. She understood the importance of knowing one's identity."" Before having her own child, Ms Drysdale had ""essentially given up"" on the idea of ever finding her biological father, given he had donated his sperm anonymously in the 1990s. She grew up knowing only that he had brown hair and green eyes and was a university student, based on information her mother had been provided by the clinic. But Ms Drysdale's desire to learn more about her genetic background grew after she gave birth to a son five years ago. Her son was still a baby when a television news story on donor conception triggered a renewed interest in her origins. With the support of her mother and after repeated phone calls and emails to the fertility clinic, she was able to obtain scant details about her biological father. Ms Drysdale's biological father had been a humanities student, his blood type was O-positive, he had three brothers and he was 21 years old at the time of his donation. After continuing to ""harass"" the clinic, she also learned of at least one donor-conceived half sibling, but the clinic could not tell her a gender or a birth date. ""Parents were not required to inform clinics whether the procedures had been successful and resulted in a child,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""Even if they had been recording information correctly, they weren't being provided it."" Finding contact with the fertility clinic tortuous, Ms Drysdale had her DNA tested and her genetic profile uploaded onto an online database. A couple of matches with distant cousins, including a 100-year-old woman living in Brisbane, who had already built an ""extensive family tree"", and another living in the United Kingdom, allowed her to trace her biological father's identity, using the small amount of information she was able to glean from the fertility clinic. It took her just three weeks. ""To be honest … If you get the matches through the DNA testing, it's not that hard to work out who the donor is,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""I knew nothing when I started."" As she contemplated her next step, the fertility clinic contacted her unexpectedly, telling her they had managed to track down her biological father and would organise mandatory counselling sessions before a potential meeting. Although she already knew his name, and how to contact him, Ms Drysdale chose to go down the clinic path fearing he may view being approached directly as ""disrespectful or invasive"". It would take a year before she finally had email contact with him and about two years before they finally met in Atherton in late 2020 along with his wife and their two children. ""The first question his wife asked me was: 'Do you have an overlapping tooth, too?',"" Ms Drysdale recalled. ""And I do. ""I always thought I looked like my mother until I met that man. He is the male version of me, just 21 years older."" Ms Drysdale and her biological father are both employed in the social science field, but more important to her is his personality. ""I had a negative view of what a father was growing up,"" she said. ""It's just really nice to find out that he is a positive, empathetic, kind human being that thinks about the world and wants to have a positive influence on it. ""So it's nice that that's the personality that I come from."" Meeting her biological father took years of trauma and heartache. The distress was only compounded when he told her he had given his details to the fertility clinic years earlier, making it clear he was open to contact, before she began her search for him. ""They either had no record of that, or … they just didn't bother to say anything,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""The clinic should have been able to simply consult their records, advise that he was open to contact and connect us. ""Instead, I experienced many months living in a state of near panic that I would not get any information or would ultimately be rejected by the person I had been searching for for so long."" Ms Drysdale is one of about 70 people who have made submissions to the Queensland parliament's Legal Affairs and Safety Committee's inquiry into matters relating to donor conception information, which will hear evidence on Friday. Her detailed 11-page submission calls for the establishment of a donor conception register, mandating clinics to provide ""full and accurate"" information in a timely manner, with penalties for non-compliance. She wants all donor-conceived people to also be able to access identifying information relating to donors and donor-conceived siblings, regardless of when they were conceived. Ms Drysdale would also like to see the birth certificates of donor-conceived people include a notation indicating they are donor conceived, with contact details for how to access further information. Given that some people source donor sperm, eggs or embryos from overseas, she is also calling for a ban on the importation of reproductive tissue if the international clinics involved cannot be held to Queensland standards. Her calls echo those of Donor Conceived Australia (DCA), an advocacy and support group for people conceived via assisted reproductive treatments, which has more than 500 members. DCA's 27-page submission to the parliamentary inquiry requests opt-in counselling for donor-conceived individuals, donors and their families as ""an essential aspect of managing information relating to donor conception"". ""Currently, there are no Queensland-based counselling services providing specialised support in the donor-conception sphere,"" the submission stated. It called for counselling to be provided by professionals not involved or affiliated with the fertility industry to ensure confidence they are ""independent, objective and focused on the interests of that client"". We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. DCA director Aimee Shackleton said her Queensland members often reported seeking help from local psychologists with ""absolutely no idea"" how to support them through the complex issues involved with donor conception. ""Donor Conceived Australia is hoping to be involved in creating competency-based accreditation courses for mental health professionals and calls for government-funded counselling to support donor-conceived people when they need it most,"" she said. Ms Shackleton said donor-conceived adults often turned to her organisation after years of searching for donors and after frequently being turned away by fertility clinics. ""They find there are no government agencies to help them,"" she said. ""They often realise they need to spend hundreds of dollars to send their genetic material to an American-based DNA company. ""Many also turn to paying professional genealogists or private investigators to do the work for them."" Since Kerri Favarato found her biological father, with her encouragement, Dr Whittaker has also supplied his own DNA profile to the same database that helped her find him. That resulted in Ms Favarato discovering six donor-conceived half siblings, all of them previously unaware they were conceived using donor sperm. ""Two of them I speak with very regularly. We've become almost like very close friends. We speak quite often,"" Ms Favarato said. As a young medical student, Dr Whittaker donated sperm two or three times a week for five years. It's impossible to know how many children he may have fathered, leaving Ms Favarato concerned about the unknown number of cousins her own children may have and the future potential for them to end up in a relationship with one of them. ""I have a nine-year-old and a five-year-old. They've got lots of cousins floating around,"" she said. ""When you talk about the numbers, it could be anywhere from 30 to 300, maybe more than that. Who knows? We don't know for sure. We'll never know. ""That's [lots of] first cousins running around that they have the potential to have relationships with."" Queensland fertility clinics are subject to National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines, which have required since September 2004 that donations of sperm, eggs and embryos can only take place if donors first consent to their information being made available, on request, once any conceived children turn 18. Under the guidelines, clinics must also take all reasonable steps to reduce the numbers of genetic relatives created through their donor programs. The Fertility Society of Australia's reproductive technology accreditation committee advises that ""a maximum of 10 donor families"" per sperm donor is acceptable, regardless of where those families are. University of Western Sydney law professor Sonia Allan, who has been studying legal issues surrounding donor conception for 20 years, described the accreditation committee system as ""self regulatory"". ""It is important to recognise that while advice or guidelines play an important role in setting standards, they do not have the force of the law,"" Professor Allan said. ""You should have the law behind it. What happens is that if it doesn't have legal force, the risk is, and this is certainly a risk in Queensland, that you have individuals or clinics who don't follow the guidance, as there is no enforceable obligation to do so. ""That can result in people having many more donor-conceived siblings than perhaps they should. ""Combined with a lack of information about their donor-conceived status and/or their biological relatives, this leads to an increased chance of them forming relationships with each other, meaning sexual relationships, because they don't know who their first-degree relatives are. ""You also create a situation where donor-conceived people live in fear or constant uncertainty. The impact on some people's lives is really unacceptable."" The Queensland parliamentary committee is due to hand down its report on donor conception law reform in August. As she awaits the outcome, Kate Drysdale will continue to build a relationship with her biological father. ""We will never have a father-daughter relationship because you can't get back 30 years of history,"" she said. ""I talk to him probably every couple of weeks on the phone, we update each other about what's happening in our lives. I see him as a friend."" Ms Drysdale's hopeful things will be different for her son — her biological father's first grandchild.

53,We're about to see the first glimpses of the monster lurking in the heart of our galaxy,science," Science Event Horizon Telescope set to reveal 'exciting results' about the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog There's a monster lurking in the heart of our galaxy, and we may get our first glimpses of it tonight. At 11pm AEST, an international team of scientists will reveal what they're calling a ""groundbreaking"" discovery from our galactic centre — and you'll be able to watch it live. There are rumbles the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) will unveil images of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the middle of the Milky Way. In 2019, the EHT captured the first-ever images of the swirling mass of superheated dust and gas surrounding a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy 55 million light-years away called M87. The image of M87's black hole silhouetted by a bright ""ring"" of emissions bent by gravity was a ""huge day in astrophysics"", according to France Córdova, director of the US National Science Foundation at the time. ""We're seeing the unseeable."" But top of the bucket list for the EHT — a planet-wide network of 11 observatories — is the black hole lurking at the centre of our own galaxy. Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A* for short, lies 27,000 light-years away, and is a lightweight in the supermassive stakes, at only about 4 million times the mass of our Sun. Will we see its event horizon? If so, will it look like the image snapped of M87? Getting a glimpse of our cosmic monster will help us understand the evolution of our galaxy, says Joss Bland-Hawthorn, an astrophysicist at the University of Sydney who studies Sgr A* but is not involved with the EHT. ""No-one knows for sure [what the image] will be, but everyone imagines it's going to be different from just seeing a shadow,"" Professor Bland-Hawthorn said. Here's what we know so far about the behemoth parked in the middle of our galaxy. Most galaxies have a supermassive black hole more than a million times the mass of our Sun at their heart. While astronomers suspected for decades our galaxy might harbour one, it was not pinned down until two separate teams in the US and Germany started studying the precise movements of stars around our galactic centre in the 1990s. ""They tracked these stars over the course of 20 or so years, and realised that the stars were moving under the influence of a very, very massive, dense, dark blob,"" Professor Bland-Hawthorn said. Their measurements indicated the blob was about 4 million times the mass of our Sun. ""They got that region down to such a tiny region, it could only be a black hole or something that behaves like a black hole."" Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel, who led the teams, shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work. We cannot see black holes directly. At their centre, gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. To snap a portrait of a black hole, the EHT detects light beamed out by hot gas swirling around the edge of the black hole's disc. But until now, our view of the black hole at the centre of our galaxy has been limited to the effects of its immense gravitational tug on material whizzing around it. In 2010, we got the best look at the centre of our galaxy when the Chandra X-ray Observatory took a snapshot that showed the remains of a massive explosion near Sgr A* and large bubbles of hot gas extending for a dozen light-years on either side of the black hole, as well as mysterious X-ray filaments. While our galaxy's central black hole flings nearby stars back out into space, and there may be a weak jet of X-rays coming from its centre, it is relatively quiet compared to other black holes. But the large bubbles first identified in X-rays by Professor Bland-Hawthorn's research, then in gamma rays by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, show it wasn't always like this. Professor Bland-Hawthorn said these billowing clouds, known as Fermi bubbles, showed something happened at the centre of the galaxy 2 to 3 million years ago. ""The evidence is overwhelming that [the bubbles were] powered by a past explosion from the black hole,"" he said. At 6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun, the black hole in the centre of M87 is one of the largest supermassive black holes in our neck of the universe. So how does it compare to Sgr A*? ""Our black hole is nothing like the black hole in M87,"" Professor Bland-Hawthorn said. For one, M87's black hole is more massive — way more. Generally, the bigger the galaxy, the heftier its central black hole. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is about half the size of M87 and contains about a 10th of the stars, so it follows that our supermassive black hole would be smaller too. Sgr A* is also nowhere near as active as M87, which is feeding on gas and stars and blasting out radiation. ""So we don't have a lot of radiation that helps us generate some kind of a shadow,"" Professor Bland Hawthorn said. And because SgrA* is changing much faster than the lumbering M87*, it has been much more challenging to get images that aren't blurred. The EHT team previously modelled what it suspected the black hole might look like in short radio wavelengths of 1.3 millimetres. Like the image of M87's black hole, the simulation of Sgr A* is fuzzy due to the distortion of gas and dust around the black hole and its crushing gravity. Given the hype, images of Sgr A* will likely be more than the gold-and-orange donut of M87's emission ring, Professor Bland-Hawthorn said. ""I'm going to predict some kind of a jet phenomenon or some kind of focused collimated something, like a jet or a bubble blasting off right from the black hole region."" Professor Bland-Hawthorn and colleagues have published evidence of a weak jet coming from the centre of the Milky Way. Jets are a phenomenon seen in other galaxies, including M87 and Centaurus A's central black hole, as captured by the EHT and reported last year. James Miller-Jones, an astrophysicist at Curtin University and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, expects to see images of a supermassive black hole with a more dynamic environment than what the EHT captured in 2019. That's because the timescales during which a black hole's surrounds change — such as variations in the hot, turbulent gas swirling around it — get longer the more massive the black hole is. For hefty M87*, changes in its environment are predicted to happen on the scale of days to weeks. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. The more diminutive Sgr A*, on the other hand, should experience changes in the order of minutes, Professor Miller-Jones said — certainly fast enough to be detected during a handful of hours of observation. ""It is unclear whether the observed emission will come from the hot gas swirling around it, or from a low-level jet, either of which could vary with time."" Yet another possibility is that the supermassive black hole is not one, but two black holes, circling each other in a colossal waltz. Pairs of black holes dwelling in galactic centres are not unusual, says Alister Graham, a Swinburne University astrophysicist who studies supermassive black holes. For instance, last year he and colleagues reported that the galaxy NGC 4424 houses a pair of supermassive black holes, brought together during a galactic merger. ""Typically, astronomers do not have the spatial resolution to see if there are two or more black holes in close orbit [in the centre of the Milky Way], so for simplicity's sake we just refer to the total central mass as a single mass,"" Professor Graham said. So if more than one supermassive black hole was found in the centre of our galaxy, ""it would be a remarkable measurement and one that has long been expected"", he added. ""Our Milky Way has many debris trails from smaller galaxies … which have been captured and torn apart. ""Some of these captives may well have delivered massive black holes that are now on their way to, or already at, the centre of our galaxy."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

54,Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love?,science,"  Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The ""36 questions of love"" have taken the dating world by storm. First published in 1997 as part of scientific research into relationships, the 36 questions of love gained global popularity through Mandy Len Catron's viral 2015 New York Times essay ""To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This"". In that essay, she outlines how she used the 36 questions with a university acquaintance on a casual night out. The result was the two fell in love, not dissimilar to two research participants who took part in the study back in 1997. In the publishing of that essay, a phenomenon was born. Social media, dating websites, dating coaches and bloggers were posting, writing or discussing the 36 questions of love — often framing these questions as a surefire method to find love — backed by science. As people attempted the 36 questions of love during dates, it became clear the 36 questions typically did not result in people falling in love. The 36 questions are three sets of 12 questions. Each set is designed to increase the amount of information a person discloses about themselves to a stranger. Not only does each set of questions increase the amount each person must disclose, but within each set, the questions increase the level of disclosure as they progress. For example, one question in the first set includes ""For what in your life do you feel most grateful?"" The second set includes questions such as ""What is your most treasured memory?"" The final set, which requires the greatest disclosure, includes questions such as ""When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?"". To answer this, one needs to go back to the original paper published by well-known relationships researcher Arthur Aron and colleagues. The research aim was to determine if progressively increasing disclosure increases closeness between two strangers. The research was not designed to test whether the questions lead to love. Instead of upskilling women to cope with the harm they risk in dating men, the self-help industry should focus on male behaviour. Across three studies, Aron and colleagues found support for the idea that a gradual increase in disclosure between strangers is related to an increase in closeness immediately after the experiment. The original research never measured whether people developed feelings of love directly after the experiment or in the future. However, the final study did a brief follow-up with most matched pairs of participants. Seven weeks after participating in the study, it was found 57 per cent of the matched pairs had a follow-up conversation, 35 per cent did something together (no more details were provided), and 37 per cent went on to sit together in class. But again, none of these findings have anything to do with people finding love and going on to have a long-term relationship. If indeed the 36 questions helped Mandy Len Canton find love, that is a positive thing. However, for the dating world to generalise about the love-generating properties of the 36 questions on the basis of one popularised case speaks to how pop culture can heavily misconstrue science. Those of us who study how people fall in love and what makes for a lasting relationship know there are many ingredients that go into making a relationship work. Some of these include: the importance people place on what they want in the ideal partner people's similarities and differences people's history of past relationships styles of dealing with conflict ability to support and respond to a partner in stressful times the alignment of partners' beliefs, values and goals each person's level of commitment and the ability to regulate emotions (and these are just some of the factors). The point of the research conducted by Aron and his colleagues is self-disclosure and enhancing closeness are two factors that matter within the larger scheme of factors. The other important point is the 36 questions provide a structured way to engage in self-disclosure. Research has shown relationships can falter when people disclose too much about themselves early on in the dating process. When people do not know each other well, it can be overwhelming for a person to hear very intimate and personal details about another. They may not know how to respond to the disclosure, or feel uncomfortable themselves. This can result in the person who disclosed coming away from the interaction feeling invalidated and vulnerable. On the other hand, when a person feels their partner responds to their disclosures and vulnerabilities, relationship intimacy is enhanced. But it is a high bar to set early in a relationship to expect a partner to respond appropriately to another who discloses highly personal information about oneself. Generally speaking, over-disclosure in the early stages of relationships can be problematic, especially for those who are anxious about their relationships. So taking a gradual and measured approach to self-disclosure and ensuring each partner has the opportunity to disclose at a comfortable pace is very important. The 36 questions are unlikely to be a ""surefire"" way to find love, but they can help people understand the importance of taking a gradual approach to self-disclosure.

55,"'Devastating': Over 90pc of reefs on Great Barrier Reef suffered bleaching over summer, report reveals",science,"  Great Barrier Reef bleaching occurred on over 90 per cent of reefs this summer, report reveals Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog More than 90 per cent of coral reefs surveyed on the Great Barrier Reef suffered some form of bleaching this summer, according to a new report. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority annual snapshot details how the 2021-22 summer led to a mass bleaching event of coral. It is the fourth mass bleaching event in seven years on the reef and the first to occur under La Niña conditions. The report says a total of 719 reefs between the Torres Strait and the Capricorn Bunker Group, east of Gladstone, in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, were surveyed from the air. Ninety-one per cent of the reefs exhibited some bleaching. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority chief scientist David Wachenfeld said the good news is that early signs suggest a low mortality rate. ""Bleaching is a stress response but bleached coral is still alive and under the right conditions it can recover and continue to live,"" he said. Dr Wachenfeld said the 2016/17 bleaching event had a high mortality rate, while the bleaching that occurred in 2020 did not kill as much coral. ""The early indications are the mortality won't be very high so we are hoping that we will see most of the coral that is bleached recover, and we will end up with an event rather more like 2020 where yes there was mass bleaching but there was low mortality."" The report said bleaching was mostly seen in the northern and central regions of the reef and was more variable in the southern region reflecting the boundary of lower heat stress exposure. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. The Australian Marine Conservation Society's Lissa Schindler said the annual snapshot report was ""devastating"" news. ""This was a La Niña year, normally characterised by more cloud cover and rain. It should have been a welcome reprieve for our reef to help it recover,"" she said. She called for both major parties to increase their 2030 emissions reductions targets in response to this latest mass bleaching event.

Australia has some 16 Pacific Island neighbours — some with a landmass a millionth our size — who unanimously declare climate change the ""single greatest threat"" to the region. To quickly get a sense why: many of these nations are isolated and vulnerable, spread across hundreds of atolls, often less than a metre above sea level, and home to some of the most culturally rich, biodiverse ecosystems. For context, the NSW city of Lismore is up to 50 times the size of some of them. For decades they've been pleading for action — as across the Pacific, climate change is not a hypothetical future event, it's already happening, with relocations and legal measures to protect sovereignty already underway. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns the window for action is rapidly closing — here's a record of what that looks like on the frontlines, and what those that live there have been trying to tell us.* Note: This story is not displaying as intended — click here to experience it in its optimised interactive format.

Unlike neighbouring continental giants, Pacific Island countries are isolated and surrounded by vast ocean, without the geographical, environmental, or financial security a large, wealthy landmass provides. Many fear they are one volcanic eruption, one cyclone, or a minor sea level rise away from total uninhabitability. The consequences of which are not only the loss of sovereignty and refugee crises, but the loss of one of the most culturally diverse, vibrant and important regions of the world — home to hundreds of unique languages, indigenous cultures, and endemic flora and fauna. For Pacific Island nations, climate change is not a debatable future concern open to interpretation, but a present reality that boils down to one fundamental question: can we afford to entertain the possibility that climate change is not an urgent existential threat, and be wrong?

57,"This medication is running out and when it's gone, 10 million more people a year could die by 2050",science,"  Antibiotic resistance is threatening our health. Will bacterial infection send us back to the medical dark age? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Tony Velkov and Jian Li share the kind of geeky science story that would work perfectly as a Hollywood script. On quiet weekends at the Monash University science labs 20 years ago, the pair discovered they were the only ones crazy — or obsessed — enough to be working on their projects while everyone else was at home enjoying a few days off. Then, when Velkov and Li realised they shared not only a work ethic but a passion for researching bacteria, their personal and professional friendship was sealed. ""We were the only guys working Saturday and Sunday and we kept running into each other,"" Velkov remembers. ""From then on it's just been fun, you know, we sit around for hours talking and brainstorming. We have been a really good team."" Over the past 12 years, the two scientists have been developing a new antibiotic that recently began phase 1 clinical trials in the US. Their intravenous drug targets deadly ""superbugs"" that are difficult to treat but can run rampant in hospital settings, causing pneumonia, blood infections, urinary tract infections, peritonitis and meningitis. This promising new drug, with the uninspiring name QPX9003, has placed the pair on the cusp of achieving something that hasn't been done for decades. No new antibiotics in this class — polymyxins, which target hard-to-kill ""gram-negative"" bacteria — have been approved since the 1950s. In March, their research was published in the journal Nature. For anyone researching bacteria and antibiotics, getting a new drug to a clinical trial is the holy grail. But it's been a lonely, gruelling process for Velkov and Li, who have at times stumped up their own cash to keep the research going. ""It can be a thankless job,"" Velkov says matter-of-factly. But why? Without new antibiotics, the world is on track to re-enter the medical dark ages by 2050, when a simple cut could kill 10 million people a year. So why are they so hard to find? For most of us, antibiotics don't feel like a big deal. At the slightest sign of a cough or a rash many GPs will dash off a prescription for antibiotics and we're all ""popping them like Tic Tacs"", Velkov says. While our medical and pharmaceutical resources have been (importantly) absorbed in solving the COVID-19 pandemic, the problem of antibiotic resistance is continuing to gain pace. Each year in Australia more than 55,000 people are diagnosed with sepsis — when an uncontrollable bacterial infection triggers inflammation throughout the body. If it can't be managed, sepsis can lead to organ failure. And effective antibiotics are a key component of treatment. About 8,500 Australians die from sepsis every year. It's a huge figure, far above the annual road toll and higher than deaths from specific cancers, and it has a huge economic impact too: antibiotic resistance costs the economy about $700 million a year. Many scientists, Velkov included, argue the threat ahead from bacteria is equally as serious as that posed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. So why is money to invest in antibiotic research so hard to come by? Just 100 years ago, as many as one in three deaths was caused by bacterial infections developing from injuries that would barely raise an eyebrow these days. Back then, if bacteria entered a cut or infection took hold after surgery, the wounds were doused in bromide — hugely painful and deadly to healthy cells too — or treated with bloodletting and leeches. Then, in September 1928, British scientist Alexander Fleming returned from his summer holiday to find one of the petri dishes of Staphylococcus bacteria in his lab had a big blob of mould growing in the middle of it. Yet the area around the mould was free of bacteria and Fleming wanted to know why. The answer led to the development of the first antibiotic – penicillin – and by the mid-1940s it had become widely available. Medical care was transformed. It used to take a particular bacterial strain a few decades to evolve to overcome the antibiotic designed to kill it. But these days, says Dr Maytham Hussein, a researcher in alternatives to antibiotics from the University of Melbourne, it takes some bacteria only two or three years to learn to resist a particular antibiotic. Some bacteria become resistant before clinical trials have even been completed. The problem is that bacteria reproduce faster than just about anything on the planet, some strains doubling their numbers in under five minutes. As the human population increases (giving bacteria more places to multiply) and more and more of these people use antibiotics to get over their infections or keep them safe after surgery — or agriculture uses antibiotics to keep infection in animals at bay — bacteria have many more opportunities to become resistant. And as this process speeds up, the probability that bacteria will find a way to overcome antibiotics increases. The result is that our stash of usable antibiotics is dwindling. Those golden staph outbreaks we hear of invading hospitals provide a glimpse of what a post-antibiotic world could look like. Or worse still, a return to the bubonic plague pandemic that devastated Europe, Asia and North Africa in the 1300s. There are plenty of medical experts who believe the post-antibiotic era is already here and COVID has supercharged the need to address the problem. Ventilators that are relied on to treat many of COVID's sickest patients in ICU also place those patients at increased risk of bacterial infection. Before COVID, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VaP) was already a widely noted medical phenomenon, affecting between 5 and 40 per cent of intubated patients. Of those diagnosed with VAP, up to 10 per cent die from a bacterial infection, not the illness that brought them to ICU in the first place. But it's not just desperately ill COVID patients who are vulnerable. Without effective antibiotics, the healthcare we take for granted – from giving birth and knee replacements to heart bypass operations and surgery for cancer – would carry the risk, once again, of exposing the patient to a life-threatening infection. ""This is the slow pandemic,"" says Professor Matt Cooper from the Institute of Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland. ""Politicians and funding bodies [respond to] acute crises, and don't get me wrong COVID is a serious disease, but with antibiotic resistance we are like a frog, slowly boiling on a stove."" With so much at stake, you might think that pharmaceutical companies would be tripping over themselves to invest in the next great antibiotic and back the next Alexander Fleming or Tony Velkov. But there's a problem. The speed with which bacteria challenge and overcome new antibiotics isn't just a scientific problem. It is also an economic one: pharmaceutical companies don't have time to make a profit. Of the antibiotics that do make it to market, most are lucky to have a 10-year life span before bacteria become resistant, Velkov says. And when it costs up to $1 billion to develop a marketable drug, a decade isn't enough time for pharmaceutical companies to get their money back and deliver a profit. Tweaking the drugs to give them longevity isn't much help because when global patent laws run out, typically after about 25 years, the generic manufacturers move in. ""There's not much money in antibiotics,"" Velkov says. ""For pharmaceutical companies, it's literally like a charity, a pro-bono activity for them, and they are not investing."" Cooper agrees: ""It is really simple, [the problem is] money, and everyone is leaving the field because it's so depressing. It's really, really hard to stay motivated."" Instead, big pharma is investing in drugs for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, melanoma and blood clots — which made up three of the top five biggest-selling drugs of 2021. Pfizer's COVID vaccine came in at number one. Moderna at number three. Velkov's close relationship with Li has sustained them both through the long years of research with little but their own scientific curiosity to keep them going. But Velkov says he also found motivation from something deeper: the idea that his work could make a difference. ""He's a very good friend of mine and we work really well together,"" Valkov says of Li. ""Many professions become about reputation, ego and achievement, whereas we don't really care what other people think of us. If our work can actually change the way people live, or help them live better, then our work means something. That's what science and medicine is about. When you lose touch with that central philosophy, you're in trouble."" Nevertheless, he admits matter-of-factly that a career devoted to bacteria and developing antibiotics can be ""a thankless job"". The two scientists years ago gave up expecting R&D funding from Australia. Of course, they had support from the university sector and then tipped in more of their own cash at critical moments, but the big investment required to make their new drug a reality came from overseas. ""It's just all about investment and development, that's all it is,"" says Velkov of the difficulty finding new antibiotics. ""We can fix this problem [of antimicrobial resistance] but governments need to prioritise it. They can't rely on drug companies and they can't rely on Jian Li and myself mucking around in the lab on our days off. We are just two blokes trying to scrounge together materials to build something."" With pharmaceutical companies wary of the financial risk of significant investment, a number of government-backed funding bodies have been set up in other countries to support drug development. Velkov and Li received two $US4.5 million donations from a US-government investment fund known as BARDA, the Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority, that enabled them to finish the research for their intravenous antibiotic. He wishes the Australian government had similar investment capacity: ""That's not even possible in Australia. We don't even have grants that size. Down Under, we just do things too small,"" he believes. Even better, Velkov says, would be establishing a global alliance — in particular, partnering with China where significant research is underway — that can pool medical developments for the greater good. It's an idea Cooper has tried several times, currently as a not-for-profit project that screens compounds for antimicrobial activity with a goal to help researchers discover new compounds that are effective against drug-resistant infections. Funding difficulties are only one part of the problem. ""I want to stress that this is tough,"" says Cooper, pointing out that the technical difficulties of finding and developing new antibiotics are real. Researchers have scoured nature to find new antibiotics from coral reefs, soil and even bat dung but ""there hasn't been much success"", says Cooper, who is preparing to publish his findings outlining the key problems facing the development of antibiotics and flags key areas of promising research. Notwithstanding disappointing results from searching the environment for new sources of antibiotics, the importance of protecting nature remains the key, says Velkov. ""Most of our medicines are natural products and we haven't come close to tapping into all of these natural resources,"" he says. Four avenues are being explored to combat the rise of the superbug. One is to continue to push the message that existing antibiotics must be used sparingly and carefully to minimise the potential for bacteria to become immune. Another is reviving antibiotics that were previously passed over because something better came along. Returning to these discoveries saves research and development money, making them a more attractive investment. Scientists are also searching for ways to support or boost the effectiveness of existing antibiotics by using other drugs and therapies, known as ""potentiators"". Maytham Hussein's work looks at the effect of cannabinoids, which if taken in tablet form can boost the performance of antibiotics. Cooper is undertaking associated research that uses peptides as potentiators. Then there is the phage therapies, a branch of medical science that harnesses viruses to attack and kill bacteria. Finally, there is immune modulation known as ""inflabiotics"", which uses similar strategies to the immune therapies being used successfully in cancer treatment. ""These get the ancient part of our immune system, our innate immunity, to stop making 'bad' inflammation and instead clear the infection with 'good' inflammation,"" Cooper says. He anticipates this therapy would face fewer issues with drug resistance because it targets the immune system, not the bug itself. ""If it is viable, it could be broadly applied,"" he says. Cooper is confident more antibiotics can be found or alternative therapies discovered. But he fears the struggle for funding has made bacterial research a disappearing field. He calculates that fewer than 1,400 researchers — experts in bacteria and antibiotics — remain working around the world. Of those, he estimates most are in their 50s and 60s and due to retire in the next decade. ""At some stage, not only will there be no money for research but all those experts will leave the field,"" he says. ""Ninety years of knowledge about how to discover and develop antibiotics, these miracle drugs that have saved more lives than any other drug, will be gone.""

58,"'A complete and utter disgrace': Regional SA to get new phone towers, but north of state misses out",science,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Living in a mobile black spot can have a devastating impact on locals trying to navigate an emergency situation, but new mobile towers in regional South Australia may fix that. The federal government announced a number of mobile infrastructure projects across the state to be co-funded with ""a range of partners"" as part of the Regional Connectivity Program. A sum of $9.8 million will see Telstra build eight new mobile towers and upgrade two base stations to improve coverage to an expected 3,564 properties, while $2.5 million will upgrade the NBN technology in Lameroo and Pinnaroo. The mobile towers will target parts of the state well-known to locals for their poor mobile coverage, including Ceduna on the state's west coast, Bowhill and Parilla in the Murray Mallee, and Wattle Range in the Limestone Coast region. However, no new towers or upgrades have been listed for northern parts of the state. Tourism operator Phil van Wegen lives in Marree — more than 350 kilometres from the nearest new tower at Pekina — and said the current mobile coverage was inadequate and dangerous. ""There's no other way of wording it, it's a complete and utter disgrace what's been delivered out here,"" he said. Mr van Wegen said the poor mobile coverage in the state's north was problematic in emergency situations. ""A lot of travellers get to the towns, expecting to get some sort of service to touch base with family members, to let them know where they are,"" he said. ""They can't even get messages out. ""Someone's going to get caught out really badly with an accident or an incident around this area."" Telstra said it was working to improve coverage in Marree and Leigh Creek after receiving funding in the first round of the Regional Connectivity Program. The upgrades will deliver new mobile coverage to seven remote Indigenous communities in the APY Lands that currently has none, and support fixed internet services for the Leigh Creek Area School and Marree Aboriginal School. Out in Oodnadatta, co-owner of the Pink Roadhouse Peter Moore lives around 530 kilometres from the nearest new mobile tower at Ceduna South. Mr Moore said there was no phone coverage in the town until only recently, and what they did have was ""not adequate"" when tourists got stuck in emergency situations. ""We've got 130 people here at Oodnadatta and when you throw in tourists trying to download everything, it does overload,"" he said. ""Our coverage only has a radius of 10 kilometres out of town and then you're back in the never-never."" Pinnaroo-based shearer Tiffany Atze lives about 37 kilometres from the nearest tower at Parilla, and was concerned the upgrades would not stretch far enough to boost the service on her remote property. ""We don't have a lot of phone coverage as soon as we go out into the paddock,"" she said. ""You have to find a hill so if you have a breakdown or something like that, or it's an emergency, you've gotta try and find coverage wherever you can."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Riverland's weekly email newsletter. The town of Bowhill will be covered by an upgraded phone tower at nearby Lowan, only 10 kilometres away. Resident Jodie Hawkes was happy to see the investment but was also waiting to see how the new tower performed. ""It's great that COVID has opened up the ability to have Zoom, and MS Teams are more acceptable, so we can have these meetings online,"" she said. ""But it's really hard and a big disadvantage for us regional people who don't have consistent and reliable service."" Ms Hawkes said regional towns like hers ""seemed to get forgotten"" in funding programs, and she was pleased to see her hometown represented this time. ""I see these announcements and the big billions of dollars that's been allocated and I always hold my breath, but I never know if it's going to reach the small areas,"" she said. Federal Regional Communications Minister Bridget McKenzie confirmed the project would be completed regardless of the federal election result, and would ensure more people had reliable internet access. Senator McKenzie said it was a good start, but more needed to be done. ""We have put forward an additional $1.3 billion to upgrade NBN wireless towers to actually extend the coverage along more than 8,000 kilometres of transport routes across the country over the next five years,"" she said. ""I hope that no matter who forms government post May 21, that they continue to invest record amounts in this vital infrastructure for the regions."" Opposition telecommunications spokesperson Michelle Rowland said a Labor federal government would invest $400 million to improve internet and mobile coverage, including an independent audit of current services. Ms Rowland said Labor had also committed $30 million to help expand on-farm connectivity and enable better wireless extension solutions in the field. ""This is really important for farmers to better utilise sensor and connected machinery technology,"" she said.

59,Avos smashed: Why are truckloads of avocados being dumped in Queensland? ,science,"  Truckloads of avocados left to rot after being dumped in far north Queensland Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Shocking images have emerged of avocados being dumped by the truckload and left to rot in far north Queensland, but growers say it is just the tip of the iceberg. The fruit became a symbol of luxury in 2016 when demographer Bernard Salt suggested young people could have saved for a house deposit sooner if they had refrained from expensive smashed avocado on toast at cafes. But now, avocados are cheap at the supermarket and going to waste on the farm as supply outstrips demand. Chair of FNQ Growers and Mareeba farmer Joe Moro said leaving ripe produce to rot was often the most economical decision for farmers for a range of reasons, including market price, substandard quality, and oversupply. ""Farmers really do not like to plough in a crop because they don't grow it just to put it back into the ground,"" Mr Moro said. ""They grow it to send to market and want to put the best product they can onto the plate and even though the farmer has made a commercial decision to dump the fruit it would still be a very emotional decision for them. While some social media users were quick to suggest farmers should donate the fruit, Mr Moro said even dumping it was expensive. ""You've got to employ people to pick the fruit, drive the trucks there, dump the product there, so it's another cost that will go through to the farmer,"" he said. Mr Moro said the oversupply issue came on the top of increased input costs, including fertilisers, chemicals, and fuel. ""Farmers are price takers and unfortunately we take the prices that come out of the markets, and we can't pass on our costs … this is a very, very tough time for the avocado industry."" Another Tablelands-based avocado grower, who did not want to be named, told the ABC he dumped produce on occasion because it wasn't up to standard and he did not want poor quality fruit in the market with his name on it. Production nationwide has doubled over the past decade, as growers have cashed in on the nation's appetite for the fruit, with between 10 and 20 per cent of all avocados grown in Australia  purchased by the food services sector. Far north Queensland has traditionally supplied about two-thirds of Australia's avocados at this time of the year but this season's harvest has been savaged by the carryover of fruit from Western Australia creating a glut in the market for the second year in a row. The big jump in production in 2021 was largely due to good seasonal conditions in Western Australia and a delayed harvest, forcing competition in markets that would typically be left for Queensland growers to service. Avocados Australia chairman Jim Kochi said the quantity of produce going into market from north Queensland was high because trees that had been planted over the past five years were now bearing fruit. ""But there has been a lot of market disruption by floods in Sydney, floods in Queensland but other than that I really don't understand why more avocados aren't being taken up and eaten because the price is as low as it was 20 years ago. ""It's painfully low for the growers and it's causing a lot of concern for growers in north and central Queensland."" Mr Kochi said dumping fruit was a last resort for growers, who were barely meeting production costs. ""There is a high supply, you could even say oversupply, of even the premium fruit and that puts the price down and value of second-grade fruit doesn't have any now so it's not worth the cost of putting it a box, paying for packaging and then freight on top of that,"" he said. Consumers might be happy to pay $1 for an avocado, but that's heartbreaking for smaller growers who are being forced to let their crops rot. New orchards being established means production will continue to rise for years to come, which is expected to increase the pressure on the domestic market, making exporting fruit essential to building a sustainable model that offer confidence growers confidence. As a result, the peak body has been placing increased urgency on forging new export markets, particularly Japan. Australia also imports avocados from New Zealand as part of a free trade agreement, sharing the market from about August to February. Avocados Australia chief executive John Tyas said the peak body had been actively trying to open and develop new export markets well ahead of this curve. But with national avocado production reaching 90,000 tonnes in 2021, it had been unable to stay ahead of the industry oversupply. The major hurdle facing Queensland avocado growers accessing the Japanese market was its strict biosecurity protocols, particularly concerning the Queensland fruit fly. ""That is a government-to-government negotiation between the Australian government and the Japanese government. ""That is progressing, and our Australian government has put proposals to Japan and we're waiting for feedback.""

60,How do the climate policies of the three major parties stack up? We asked some experts to rank them,science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog You'd think the government and opposition would be keen to focus on the number-one issue for voters this election campaign. Yet if 2019 was the climate change election, 2022 is shaping up to be the don't-talk-about-climate-change election. Despite climate change topping voters' (29 per cent) list of concerns, both the Labor Party and LNP have been avoiding it like the plague. While that might suit them — given the perceived divisiveness of the issue among some of their prospective supporter bases — it leaves many climate-concerned voters with very little to go on. So, we've asked some Australian climate scientists, all of them IPCC-contributing authors, to take a look at the climate policies of the Coalition, Labor and the Greens, and give you a breakdown of how each major party's climate policies stack up. Responses have been trimmed for brevity, and omitted where they have doubled up. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese gear up for the third and final leaders' debate. The Liberal Party policy includes net-zero by 2050 and a 2030 emissions reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels, though they say we're on track for higher than that. Their Long-term Emissions Reduction Plan includes such focuses as clean energy technology, carbon capture and storage, and investment in emerging technologies like low-emissions cement and agriculture. It's a ""clear plan"" for achieving net-zero by 2050, according to a statement on Scott Morrison's website, that will ""deliver results through technology not taxes"". The Labor Party policy includes a net-zero target by 2050 and a 2030 emissions reduction target of 43 per cent on 2005 levels. Their Powering Australia plan includes a national electric vehicle strategy, electricity grid upgrades, and investment in green manufacturing. Their plan will ""prioritise growth and investment for the regions"" according to the ALP website, while delivering Australian business ""certainty"". The Greens policy is to reach net-zero by 2035. Their focus includes clean energy generation and a transition away from coal and gas by 2030. Their Powering Past Coal and Gas plan outlines EV and green industry strategies, and includes ending fossil fuel subsidies and closing tax loopholes. Their plan will ""create hundreds of thousands of jobs, bring electricity costs down, and drive our economy into the future"", according to their website. The ABC put a set of four questions to each of the scientists. They were first sent on April 27, so some answers may pertain to policies current as of that date, regardless of subsequent updates. Peter Newman — no ""This policy is not seriously ensuring the transition begins immediately and leads to interim targets that are achievable, and hence could lead to net-zero by 2050. [That is what is needed to] keep us within reach of the 1.5C target. The work on hydrogen hubs may be the best thing the Liberals have done, but does not appear in the policy, so it doesn't seem a serious exercise. The assessment here is based on what is provided as the Liberal Policy for Environment. However, it does not set out many of the activities already underway and/or committed and in budgets. This means it seems to be lacking substance … [and] the public have only this very simplistic list of ideas."" Lesley Hughes — far from it ""If every country was to follow Australia's lead on climate, the world would be headed for warming in excess of 3C and even up to 4C. At 3C or 4C … Black Summer will be considered a cool year. Really, if we are to have any chance of limiting warming to 1.5C, Australia needs to be aiming high, and setting a target to cut emissions by 74 per cent by 2030 and getting to net-zero emissions by 2035. This is the target recommended last year by an independent Climate Targets Panel…"" Nerilie Abram — wildly inconsistent ""To limit warming to 1.5 degrees requires Australia's emissions to be cut by 74 per cent by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2035. The current Liberal Party policy would have used up our entire remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees before we even get to 2030."" Peter Newman — the best thing yet ""This policy is the best thing yet we have seen in Australian politics to get us to being a good global citizen that abides by its Paris commitments. An ALP government could take these commitments to the next UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] conference in Egypt in December and show they have ratcheted up their level of commitment with a clear set of strategies behind them."" Nerilie Abram — no ""It increases the ambition of Australia's 2030 emission reduction target to 43 per cent, which is a substantial improvement on the Liberal Party target, but isn't the 50-74 per cent reduction that Australia needs to make by 2030 to play our part in meeting the Paris Agreement."" Andy Pitman — 1.5C virtually impossible Professor Pitman gave the same response to this question for all parties. He said that he believes limiting warming to 1.5C is now ""virtually impossible"". ""Any party that commits to limiting warming to 1.5C needs to explain how [they will do it]. It would require overshoot and active removal of carbon from the atmosphere which is subject to multiple technical and feasibility constraints."" Peter Newman — yes, but ... ""Yes in theory, but not in practice. Paris requires commitments to go beyond targets by having detailed strategies of how to achieve them. These strategies are good ideas, but [need to be] linked into detailed modeling that relates to delivery."" Lesley Hughes — yes ""Yes, this policy does meet that goal. It is the only policy from a major party that matches the scale and pace of action the climate science demands. Any shot at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires drawing down significant amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The Greens' plan recognises this, and proposes achieving 100 million tonnes of 'negative emissions' by 2040, although it does not elaborate on how this will be achieved."" Nerilie Abram — yes ""The policy of the Greens is consistent with the scientific evidence for the scale and speed of emission reductions needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees."" Lesley Hughes — no confidence ""To be frank, we have no confidence whatsoever in the LNP's Net Zero by 2050 plan. It may as well have been written in crayon. Remarkably, the Liberal-National Government's own modeling for this does not get Australia to net-zero by 2050. It is, in fact, only a little more than half by 2050."" Nerilie Abram — no confidence ""Their plan for net-zero relies on untenable assumptions of greenhouse gas removal and doesn't actually even get to zero by 2050."" Andy Pitman — not enough information to assess ""That is very hard to assess because there are no intermediate targets. Given it is not ""the Liberal Party"" that is central here, rather it is the Coalition, and given statements from some in the Coalition, I would prefer to see a legislated 2035 target from which to build."" Peter Newman — confident ""The modeling by Reputex [energy research company] in the ALP policy seems very credible and traces each policy into a quantitative delivery of 43 per cent greenhouse gas reduction by 2030, based on conservative and well-researched assumptions. These early interventions are the most important part of the transition to 2050, as once they are underway they take off."" Lesley Hughes — confident ""First of all, the modeling Labor has used is robust and it checks out. So I can say with confidence that the 2030 target in the ALP plan has set Australia on a path to achieve net-zero in 2050."" Andy Pitman — low confidence ""I think net-zero is hugely challenging to achieve and some of the strategies are less likely to deliver emission reductions than I think the ALP hope. However, they have set a target for 2030 which I think is important as it … allows an evaluation of how they are tracking."" NB. The Greens consider net-zero by 2050 a ""death sentence"" and aim to reach net-zero by 2035 or sooner. Some of the responses below relate to the Greens' aim of net-zero by 2035. Peter Newman — low confidence in net-zero by 2035 ""[I'm] not sure they can get to 100 per cent by 2035. This is a serious plan which is quantified and costed with jobs and greenhouse gas savings clearly assigned in each state. The need to make such policies become real and deliverable begins with good modeling and then has to bring all the states. This is hard to see in the document."" Nerilie Abram — low confidence in net-zero by 2035 ""I don't doubt the ambition of the Greens, and their aim for net-zero by 2035 is science based. But net-zero is a hugely challenging target that we don't yet have the technical capability to achieve, and this plan doesn't lay out the detail for how Australia will reach [it]."" Andy Pitman — moderately confident in net-zero by 2050 ""The Greens' climate policies are consistent with what scientists have been saying for a long time. If implemented, I think this would get Australia close to net-zero by 2050."" Peter Newman — not serious ""Not serious and lacking detail even on their best projects being announced. Obviously, they are divided and unable to make a serious contribution."" Lesley Hughes — not an effective climate policy ""The Morrison government's climate policy can be summarised pretty quickly and simply really, in that the Morrison government has no effective federal climate policy. [They] are actively supporting the expansion of fossil fuel production while at the same time banking on … technology that may or may not materialise sometime in the next three decades to solve the greatest threat of our time: climate change. That's a hell of a gamble."" Nerilie Abram — lacks ambition ""It has lots of catchphrases designed to make it seem like they are doing enough, but it lacks any real ambition and is not based on the scientific evidence."" Andy Pitman — difficult to assess without targets ""A 2035 target should be part of the equation in my view, and without that target, the viability of the Liberal strategies is difficult to assess."" Peter Newman — a solid start ""A very solid start with the potential to make a real difference. There is confidence in this climate policy as it's been taken seriously with a very good quantitative basis to the next steps, which can put us clearly into being Paris-compliant. There could be much more of a target, but it's still up there with most progressive nations."" Lesley Hughes — a good start ""It's a good start, but it could certainly be more ambitious. Under the ALP plan, renewable energy (like solar and wind) is expected to power 82 per cent of our electricity needs by 2030. So there's a focus on transitioning the grid to renewables. Notably, the modeling will lead to significant jobs growth and private investment."" Nerilie Abram — promising elements ""This policy has some very promising elements, including a strong focus on emission reductions this decade … that is certainly what is needed if we are going to tackle the climate change problem."" Andy Pitman — not particularly ambitious but … ""It balances what is electorally palatable with meeting the 2C limit under Paris. It is not particularly ambitious but, given where we are, it is probably about as ambitious as can be achieved without a very great deal of courage."" Peter Newman — strong, though lacking sophistication ""This has a series of policies for adaptation and mitigation that are quantified, though not with the sophistication of the Reputex [ALP] modelling. It shows how they will reach 100 per cent by 2035 and then by 2050, it goes into negative emissions by regenerating the landscape with carbon farming. However, it is not modelled showing delivery. It is simply straight lines from now to a precipitous drop to 100 per cent in the next 12 years. They have some transport policies including public transport, but in the end, they are focused on decarbonising power. The repair of the landscape is a strong part of the policy, but lacks detail."" Lesley Hughes — a lot to like, with some gaps ""There is a lot to like about this policy. It's ambitious and it takes tangible and urgent steps to reduce emissions quickly and to rewire and electrify Australia. It would also see big polluters having to pay for the damage caused by their emissions contributions. However, it does have some gaps: it does not cover Australia's responsibility to support vulnerable communities abroad with adapting to the impacts of climate change. The plan could also be strengthened with clearer steps and targets for phasing out gas production and exports from Australia."" Nerilie Abram — science based, but lacks detail ""The aims of this policy are science based, but the plan lacks the level of detail and modeling of the major parties. The Greens, together with independent candidates, could have an important role to play in forcing the future government to raise ambitions, so that Australia's emission reductions efforts this decade happen with the speed and scale that is needed."" Andy Pitman — broadly consistent with science, but ... ""I think the Green's climate policies are broadly consistent with the science — the challenge is their implementation and that needs to be done urgently, and politically feasibly.""

Phillip Island Nature Parks research officer Paula Wasiak said the record had been broken several times in recent weeks. ""We had the highest number of penguins cross last week with 5,219 penguins crossing our Penguin Parade beach within the 50 minutes of the count, which is amazing,"" she said. ""The previous record only happened a few days before and that was just over 4,500 penguins. ""But what's really unique about these record-breaking nights is that they're happening now. ""Usually, we have record-breaking nights when the penguins are at the peak of their breeding season, so around November and December."" Each night last week, between 3,000 and 5,000 penguins came in. Peak numbers in spring and summer are usually 2,500 birds. ""That being said, last November we also had a record-breaking night so that was also over 4,000 birds,"" Ms Wasiak said. Ms Wasiak said conservation efforts that focused on fox eradication and habitat work were likely playing a role in the high numbers. But she suspected the prolonged La Nina event also may be having an impact on food stocks. ""What we can speculate, to the best of our abilities – it must be really excellent feeding conditions right now for the penguins close to shore,"" Ms Wasiak said. ""We're having a lot of penguins just doing single day trips. Usually when they're not breeding in the winter, penguins can actually spend up to a month out at sea."" The population is also in the midst of what is known as the autumn breeding attempt, where older penguins in particular try to breed ahead of winter. ""Older penguins are really tuned in to subtle environmental cues,"" Ms Wasiak said. ""In autumn, we do start seeing a slight increase of marine productivity, and these penguins are likely to pick up on these cues."" Ms Wasiak said this year's autumn breeding attempt was looking like being the biggest the parks had ever seen.

62,Some of Australia's brightest minds head to regional Australia for biotech conference,science,"  Biotechnology brains flock to regional Australia, but trials still based in metro areas Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog James Campbell is pretty proud of the groundbreaking work he is involved in to help patients better battle cancer. The CEO and managing director of the publicly listed company, Patrys Limited, is helping drive the development of a potential cancer drug that can cross the delicate blood-brain barrier, and help reduce tumour sizes and increase patient survival. It's just one of the many potentially life-saving ideas and developments that some of Australia's brightest minds will be bringing to Albury for this week's Bioshares Biotech Summit. While regional Australia is not often the first place people think of when it comes to biotechnology, Dr Campbell, who also sits on the board of Australia's biotechnology industry organisation AusBiotech, said it was where a lot of the action was happening. ""I think regional Australia is really important,"" he said. ""Biotech is not an industry many people think is amenable for being in the regions, but I think we have seen in the past few years that with the right approach, the right attitude, the right infrastructure and technology, folks can work from pretty much anywhere. ""Why wouldn't you work from regional Australia when we have so many advantages? ""You don't need to be in a capital city to really push some of these technologies along."" While the biotech ideas may fly thick and fast, the sector is one that also requires a lot of patience. It takes on average between 10 and 14 years, and a funding injection of about $2.5 billion, for an idea to be delivered to patients. Much of this development relies on the backing of private investors. It can take even longer for these treatments to reach patients in regional areas, despite some of the minds behind the groundbreaking developments working from there. ""What I'd say is it's always important for patients to be having that discussion with their doctors: 'Can we please try to get me enrolled in clinical trials?', even if that means trials in the capital cities,"" Dr Campbell said. The CEO of Australian pharmaceutical company Amplia, John Lambert, is another leader who will be visiting Albury for the conference. Dr Lambert's team is working on an experimental treatment that attacks tumours that have built up a strong resistance to the immune system and chemotherapy and are difficult to treat, including those in the pancreas and ovaries. The company's experimental drug aims to disrupt the protective barrier around those tumours and enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatment. It's another exciting project happening in the biotech sphere and an example of one that could potentially be developed in regional areas if the right infrastructure was in place. ""A large regional hospital that has access to adequate facilities and a number of patients go there for treatment would be a real magnet,"" Dr Lambert said. But for now, the majority of the trials that need to be conducted in controlled clinical environments remain in major cities. ""Being from the city, we recognise the inconvenience and disruption that people participating in clinical trials, and for that matter even getting routine treatment for people with serious illness, can encounter,"" Dr Lambert said. ""The trial our company is about to commence will initiate recruiting people who do live in larger state capitals but, as we expand the trial if we see early signs of success, we would hope to push the trial into regional centres, and if the drug is approved it would be available for everyone. ""People in the regions need treatment just as much as everyone else, and they have the additional burden of having to travel often to get that treatment.""

63,An island popular with tourists for its cheese and rugged beauty will soon be home to a giant mine,science,"  The rush to renewable energy means a new mining boom. But first, Australia needs to make some tough choices Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Electric cars, solar panels, large batteries and wind turbines — the technology needed to go green relies on what can be a dirty industry. ""It's absolutely ironic, but to save the planet we are going to need more mines,"" says Allison Britt, director of mineral resources at government agency Geoscience Australia. The need for one of the biggest increases in mining the world has ever seen is forcing some tough choices and redrawing old battlelines between environmentalists and miners. In Tasmania, a mine that's been leaking contaminated water for the past five years wants permission to expand into a wilderness area because the lead, zinc and copper it produces are vital for solar panels, electric cars and wind turbines. King Island, famed for its high-end produce and rugged beauty, will soon be home to one of the world's largest tungsten mines. Outside Darwin, an open-cut mine that will produce lithium vital for electric car batteries looks to be already impacting local waterways. Australian National University professor of economic geology John Mavrogenes says tough decisions need to be made. ""We have to decide as a country, how valuable is a place and is it worth risking for mining,"" he says. These decisions are made even more difficult by China's control of the 35 so-called ""critical minerals"", which are not only vital for the transition to renewable energy but for economic and national security. The US and its allies fear Beijing could restrict or cut off supply in times of conflict. And then there's the need to quickly act on climate change. ""Everything is now an emergency,"" says entrepreneur and inventor Saul Griffith, whose advocacy organisation Re-wiring America has advised US politicians and businesses. ""We need to be making wind turbines 10 times as fast as we do. We need to be making solar cells 10 times as fast as we do. We need to be making batteries and electric vehicles 10 times as fast as we do today."" An electric vehicle needs about 200kg of minerals like copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium. That's six times more than a petrol-powered car. A wind turbine needs four times more minerals than a coal-fired power station to generate the same amount of electricity. These tough choices are increasingly becoming a trade-off between preserving local habitats and the global effort to avert the worst effects of climate change. Kirsty Howey from the Northern Territory Environment Centre says it's ""a confounding issue for the environmental movement"". ""There's absolutely no doubt that we have to move to mining of critical minerals if we are going to address the climate crisis,"" she says. But she argues governments need to ensure miners adopt far higher environmental standards as Australia gears up for its latest boom. A mine in Tasmania's sensitive Tarkine wilderness highlights the difficult choices facing Australia and the world in the rush towards renewables. The historic Rosebery mine, now owned by Chinese giant MMG, wants to clear 280 hectares of wilderness for a new tailings dam. Its general manager, Steven Scott, says if permission is not granted, the mine will shut within two years and with it will go the zinc, copper and lead vital for wind turbines and electric cars. He insists the company has a ""really good environmental performance record"". Documents obtained by Four Corners suggest otherwise. In a memo to the Tasmanian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), MMG admitted an existing tailings dam had been leaking contaminated water for almost five years. It said ""several complaints"" had been made and conceded there was a ""pressing need to rectify"" the problem. That was more than two years ago and the dam continues to leak. The EPA told Four Corners contaminated water had flowed into the river on 18 occasions since late 2018. Despite this, MMG has never been fined. In a statement, the EPA conceded MMG had some ""issues"" with the tailings dam and said the leaked water contained ""elevated levels of metals"". MMG says the leaking at the dam is a ""legacy issue"" and it has significantly improved management of the facility in recent years. The company insists it should be allowed to build the new tailings dam, pointing out the mine's products support a ""lower-emission future"". The father of Australia's green movement, Bob Brown, who is leading protests against MMG, dismisses this as ""green spin"" and says the mining industry is using renewable energy as a cover. His supporters have blocked MMG's access to the proposed site, chaining themselves to trees and parking a mini-van over the road. Mr Brown insists he's not against the Rosebery mine, saying MMG has other options for the tailings dam and it should not be built at the expense of a sensitive wilderness area like the Tarkine. Not everywhere is the battle to develop critical minerals so fraught. King Island, off the Northern coast of Tasmania, is famous for its beef and cheese, oysters, kelp and crayfish. Soon it will be famous for something quite different — one of the world's largest tungsten mines. Demand for renewable energy and anxiety over China's dominance of the tungsten market will see the King Island mine reopen after 30 years. It's a test of whether tourism and agriculture can happily exist alongside mining. Jobs and a larger permanent population have been a major selling point and the local community is firmly behind the project. The Australian company which owns the mine has promised 65 full-time jobs when it reopens next year. The supply chains for critical minerals will determine who controls the next industrial revolution, which will be dominated by the switch to renewables. The International Energy Agency's most conservative forecasts expect demand for lithium to grow 13-fold in the 20 years to 2040, rare earth demand to triple, copper to double and cobalt is expected to increase at least six times. Mr Griffith says Australia is well positioned to supply all these critical minerals to the world and doing so is one of the biggest contributions the country can make to combat climate change globally. ""Australia is still the luckiest country,"" he says. ""Australia is first, second, third or fourth in the world in terms of reserves and production of all of the critical things for this century."" One of the most sought-after minerals this century will be lithium, a commodity for which Australia has rapidly become the world's biggest exporter. Among the newest players in this sector is Australia's Core Lithium, a company worth more than $2 billion before it has even started mining. The rapid increase in its share market value follows Core signing a supply deal with Tesla in March. While shareholders are happy, some living near the mine, 80km outside Darwin worry that too little attention has been paid to its environmental impact. Scientist and local environment activist Pauline Cass says the impact on a creek flowing through the mine can already be seen. ""The water's very, very milky and murky. It's meant to be clear flowing,"" Ms Cass says. ""The mine is only in the very, very early stages and we are already seeing this consequence."" Kirsty Howey from the Northern Territory Environment Centre believes topsoil and gravel from the mine's construction are running into the creek, which then flows into Darwin Harbour. She believes Core Lithium is potentially breaking the law and has lodged a complaint with the NT Environmental Protection Authority. Core Lithium declined requests for an interview. It plans to mine here for seven years and has promised to only partly rehabilitate the area. Locals are sceptical the NT government will enforce a tough rehabilitation regime and they want global tech companies and automakers to take responsibility for how the minerals they use are mined. ""In my view, Tesla should know what's happening on the ground,"" Dr Howey says. That would be good corporate practice. ""It raises a lot of questions for me about the nature of the kinds of deals that are being done in the rush to feed the boom for electric vehicles and the renewables industry more broadly.""

64,"Wild summer sparks 'extraordinary' pelican breeding season as 30,000 birds look for mates",science,"  Thousands of pelicans flock to NSW's central west as an 'extraordinary' event unfolds Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog More than 30,000 pelicans have descended on a river system in New South Wales, in one of the largest breeding events recorded in Australia. A wet and wild summer across the state created the ideal conditions for the native species to breed at Lake Brewster, in the state's Central West. ""The health of not only Lake Brewster but the whole of the river system — the wetlands that are all part of the habitat — are all in very good condition,"" Mal Carnegie, from the Lake Cowal Foundation, said. ""Each day those chicks are requiring between half a kilogram and a kilogram of food, so you are looking at between 15 and 30 tonnes of biomass per day to feed the chicks and adults. It's an incredible amount of fish."" Mr Carnegie said it had been ""extraordinary"" to see the pelican colony develop over the past six months. ""We have been very fortunate, all of us involved in the monitoring and management of the colony to see a spectacle like that first-hand."" The Department of Planning and Environment's senior environmental water manager, Joanne Lenehan, said the scale of the breeding event was very rare. ""Most nesting events are between a few hundred to 6,000 to 8,000, particularly along the coast, so this event is at least twice what we consider a large or average event,"" she said. Over the past six months, more than 15,000 nests have been recorded at the lake, surpassing the previous record of 8,000 in 2010-11. The pelican is not regarded as vulnerable or under threat, but population numbers have steadily declined since the 1970s. ""There does seem to be evidence of a decline both locally and regionally in the populations,"" Ms Lenehan said. ""We have seen a loss of nesting sites including Lake Cowal here in the Central West, so these events are important to keep the population healthy. ""Like most water birds, they face challenges from a reduction and change in water flow regimes and loss of habitat due to competition with development of urban environments."" Mr Carnegie said breeding seasons like the one seen at Lake Brewster are vital to preserving the pelican. ""If you think about the life span of a pelican, realistically they only have three, maybe four ,opportunities to contribute in terms of reproduction. ""These events are critical to maintaining and improving the population across Australia."" A collaboration between university researchers, conservationists and state officials has led to the use of drones and artificial intelligence to more effectively count the population of the colony. Mr Carnegie regularly flies a drone over the colony, taking a series of images and videos that are sent to the University of New South Wales where they are analysed by an AI program. ""It is an emerging technology or use of technology, and it is very much at the cutting edge in terms of monitoring colonial water bird breeding,"" he said. ""The information gathered from the drone then helps Water NSW and Environment NSW in terms of supporting the colony with its development."" To further understand the movements of pelicans, over 400 juvenile birds have had bands attached to their legs over the past six months to allow for easy identification. Ms Lenehan said they hope the tracking of the banded pelicans will uncover vital information about the species. ""It is the one bird that no-one ever sends me pictures of to say, 'What bird is this?' ""Despite this we know very, very little about them, so we hope to answer those age-old questions of how do they know to come inland to breed on these flood events, how far do they move, how far do they forage?""

65,Meet the young Aussie with four wheels and a dream to show your kids they can create 'the next big thing',science,"  From the 'deserts of Western Australia to everywhere in between', Red Dirt Robotics is shaping the next generation of engineers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Trial and error: it's a simple but frustrating strategy. If you ask Jameson Harvey, however, it's all part of the process. ""There's always lots of lots of problem-solving that you have to do when you're working on robots,"" he laughs. ""And, as soon as you think you've figured something out, and you've finally got it working, I guarantee something else will happen."" After tagging along with a couple of mates to his school's robotics club in 2017, Jameson felt ""the rush"". His love for all things STEM quickly catapulted him from the suburbs of the Sunshine Coast onto the world stage. ""In 2019, my team and I took out second place at the FIRST Lego League World Festival, which is the world's biggest robotics competition in Houston, Texas,"" the 18-year-old says. ""When we came back from America, we thought that we should start to pass that knowledge on."" It ignited a passion to make robotics accessible to everyone, irrespective of where they lived. And, from his humble ""old Troopy"", Jameson is now mixing dirt and determination to shape the next generation of young engineers. Employment in STEM occupations is projected to grow by 12.9 per cent in the next five years, well above the average of all occupations (7.8 per cent). However, students in remote, rural and regional Australia are being left behind. The average 15-year-old from remote Australia is around 1.5 years behind metropolitan students in science, while students from regional and remote areas are under-represented in the STEM workforce. Despite managing huge projects and more than 100 employees in China, Yaning can't find work as an engineer in Australia. He's not alone — but this is happening while demand for engineers is soaring. ""STEM and robotics, robotics especially, it's going to have some sort of footing in just about every industry that there is: agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, which it's already pretty centred in,"" Jameson says. ""Robotics is just growing and growing and growing."" Sectors such as engineering will be more important than ever in the future, echoes Chris Stoltz, a professor in engineering practice at La Trobe University. However, the industry is currently hamstrung by a lack of engineers. ""The demand pre-COVID was about 16,000 engineers here, and universities are only producing about 9,000,"" says Professor Stoltz, who teaches on La Trobe's Bendigo campus, in central Victoria. ""The shortage of engineers is such that some of the companies in regional areas have had to resort to sponsoring [employees from overseas]."" For those within the sector, the state of play is simple: Australia’s capacity to produce its own engineers begins at school. However, while participation in STEM subjects is languishing across the board, particularly among girls, research has found students from regional and remote areas are more likely to have negative perceptions of STEM disciplines and are less likely to pursue a career in those areas. This divide between regional and metropolitan outcomes is influenced by a myriad factors, not limited to a lack of resources, difficulties in finding and retaining qualified STEM teachers, and fewer career and further education opportunities. But moves are afoot to bridge the gap. Dubbed Red Dirt Robotics, Jameson is heading off on a 12-month road trip, visiting regional schools in outback Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia to teach students essential skills for STEM-based subjects and future jobs. ""What I found is that close to none of these students have ever seen or touched or even really heard of robotics and what it can do, and what it means to them at a primary school or high school level,"" Jameson says. ""A lot of the teachers who I'm getting in contact with, they want to have these robotics programs in their schools and their courses. ""But they don't have the knowledge themselves to be teaching a class of students or they don't have the funding through that school to be able to justify buying a whole robotics kit."" From the ""deserts of Western Australia to everywhere in between"", Jameson teaches students the foundation skills of programming and coding a robot, and what it takes to build something that is not only going to work, but ""be strong and functional"". He wants to give children a sense of what it is like to compete in robotics competitions, ""so that, hopefully, they can get that same sort of rush that I did, and then develop their own passion"". ""For a lot of the places that I'm visiting, they'll be mining towns, or they'll be agricultural towns,"" Jameson says. ""I want to show the kids in these classrooms that there's more to just working on the farm or going into the mines for your 12-hour shift. ""You can develop the next big thing to be able to combat some of the issues that you've seen working on a farm or working in the mines."" The ABC's Trailblazers program provides a platform for people aged 18 to 28 who are doing inspiring things in their regional town. Across Australia, the robotics industry is responding at a classroom level. Engineers Australia's National STEM strategy 2019-23 notes that the country's capacity to develop ""more of its own future engineers is limited by falling participation in year 12 science and mathematics"". In the case of girls, it adds, ""this is impeded by alarmingly low participation"". ""We need to do better, to teach maths and science in more of an applied way,"" says Jane MacMaster, chief engineer at Engineers Australia. ""We want to help kids understand how science and maths can lead to a really exciting and inspiring and interesting career."" Research shows that fostering engagement in STEM education in primary school positively influences later participation. If Australia wants a strong pipeline of experienced engineers, Ms MacMaster adds, ""we need to nurture the whole pipeline, starting from education early in childhood right through to our students and graduates"". And, amid a nationwide skills shortage and a reluctance by some to consider employment outside capital cities, those networks are needed more than ever within regional communities. The situation has prompted Victoria's La Trobe University to look at an ""alternative model"" of learning, says Professor Scholtz, where students secure employment within the engineering sector, and complete their degrees on the job. ""When I was in Echuca for a careers night, a young man asked me, 'Can I study without going to Bendigo? I've got a part-time job with a company in Echuca and I love it, I play footy, I play cricket, I've got a lot of family'. ""So, we started thinking, 'Well, how do we deliver engineering training without the kids having to leave home?' ""It's not like the days gone by when kids from the country can't get out quick enough. I think that's changed a bit."" These days, ""kids want to do something that contributes to the world"", Ms MacMaster says. ""They also want to do something that interests them and is exciting, and engineering ticks all those boxes. ""We need to do a better job at linking mathematical and scientific concepts and skills to these amazing things in the real world, like sending things into space and designing equipment that helps people live longer, healthier lives."" As Jameson clocks up the kilometres, his conviction is as strong as ever. ""I want to make robotics as accessible to as many people as possible,"" he says. ""My hope is that, through that, the schools will see that the students who are participating in these courses really enjoyed what they're learning and, hopefully, they'll be able to divert some funding or even fund-raise for a robotics program to be put into that school."" As word of Red Dirt Robotics has spread, Jameson has found himself fielding calls from across the country, ""even as far away as Broome"". And, if all goes to plan this year, he plans to take the show on the road once more. ""I'd love to head back out again next year, because there'll be plenty of places I missed,"" he says. ""I just want to keep doing what I love, which is sharing robotics."" The ABC's Trailblazers program provides a platform for people aged 18 to 28 who are doing inspiring things in their regional town.

66,Will we be saying goodbye to petrol? What the major parties are planning for electric vehicles,science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Soaring petrol prices across Australia have sparked fuel security concerns. But that's not the only thing. It has also sparked hope in Australians — hope that their future government will invest in a transport system that isn't reliant on oil, but electricity. Here, we break down what the major parties are offering around electric vehicles. Reducing emissions in the transport sector is at the forefront of the Coalition's Future Fuels and Vehicles Strategy plan. Under this strategy, the government will work with the private sector to increase the uptake of hybrid, hydrogen, electric and bio-fuelled vehicles. What exactly does this mean? The government will focus on four streams of key infrastructure and technology investment: The Coalition plans to fund 50,000 charging stations in Australian homes, in a bid to encourage more people to buy electric vehicles. The strategy does not include subsidies or tax incentives that would make electric vehicles more affordable. The government says it will spend $250 million — including $178m of new funding — to build charging stations. The Coalition's increased funding for charging infrastructure is expected to create more than 2,600 jobs over three years. It does not say exactly how or where those jobs will be created but does point to employment opportunities through supply chains and manufacturing needed to sustain an electric vehicle market. Upgrading the electricity grid to boost renewable energy and cut down power prices are at the centre of Labor's Powering Australia plan. This includes the introduction of an Electric Car Discount to make electric vehicles cheaper. As part of the discount, Labor will exempt electric cars below the luxury car tax threshold ($79,659 in 2021-22) from: The federal opposition's aim with this cut-off is to encourage car manufacturers to import and supply more affordable electric models in Australia. Labor will also consider how the Commonwealth's existing investment in infrastructure can be leveraged to increase charging stations across the country. This includes installing 400 ""community batteries"" in suburbs and towns. The batteries, which are about the size of a large car, are aimed at cutting power prices for up to 100,000 homes and taking better advantage of household solar. They would charge during the day and be drawn down during the night, saving households the costs of battery installation and maintenance. Labor says these incentives will cost around $250 million over three years. The Electric Vehicle Council estimates a $50,000 electric vehicle will be more than $2,000 cheaper as a result of removing the import tariff. If a $50,000 model is provided through work arrangements, Labor's fringe benefits tax exemption could save employers up to $9,000 a year. If elected, the party's Electric Car Discount will begin in July 2022. After three years, it will be reviewed in light of electric car take-up at that time. In a push for an 'electric vehicle revolution', the Greens plan for all new vehicle sales by 2030 to be electric. Its policy mirrors international efforts to ban petrol and diesel cars, and aims to align Australia's emissions standards with those of the United States and Europe. The Greens' policy has five main elements: The Greens say they will provide $2 billion over the next two years to FutureGrid, the party's proposed publicly owned electricity transmission and distribution company, to build new electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Let's break down the climate change policies of the major parties: Coalition, Labor and Greens. They will also invest $1.2 billion in manufacturing electric vehicles and their components in Australia. In terms of its fast-charging infrastructure proposal, the Greens claim it will allow drivers to get to 80 per cent charge in approximately 15-30 minutes, with a focus on installing more than 30,000 fast chargers at critical points across the country. The party has also said that supporting an electric vehicle manufacturing industry would create thousands of jobs for Australians. As the world of car-making gradually becomes electric, many manufacturers are planning to sell only zero-emissions cars by 2030. However, leading car brands say the lack of regulation on their emissions in Australia is hindering their ability to bring electric vehicles here. The peak motoring body, the Australian Automobile Association, said electric vehicles would not come here in great numbers until an emissions regulation was in place — something the major parties have not proposed, despite the industry considering it a key measure needed to improve electric vehicle uptake.

67,"It's no longer a core business, so does Tasmania still deserve to be called the Apple Isle?",science,"  Is Tasmania still the Apple Isle? Growers crunch the numbers as domestic and export markets shrivel Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When the Duke and Duchess of York visited Tasmania in 1927 they were greeted in Hobart by a huge street arch made from apples that proudly read: ""Welcome to Apple Land"". For about 100 years, Tasmania heavily marketed itself to the world as the ""Apple Isle""  — an idyllic English farming Utopia —  to grow its apple exports and attract new residents. But the export industry collapsed almost overnight in the 1970s when Tasmania was squeezed out of the European market. The Apple Isle title sticks 50 years on, despite the state exporting only 8 per cent of Australia's apples last season and making up only 16 per cent of the domestic market. So, can it keep its Apple Isle title? When University of Tasmania history and classics PhD candidate Carla Baker visited Tasmania in the 1990s, her first question was: ""Where are all the apples?"" And since moving to the state a decade ago, it is a question that has turned into a thesis focusing on apples in the north of the state. Ms Baker is looking into when the Apple Isle title came about, and how the industry collapsed. ""Tasmanian apples were a very big part of the empire marketing board campaign in the 1920s and 1930s,"" Ms Baker says. Apples were part of the ecological colonisation of Tasmania, by making it look like Britain. ""Apples were a very English kind of landscape."" She will look into areas like Lilydale, in the state's north east, that once had hundreds of hectares of apples, but today has none Captain William Bligh planted Tasmania's first apple trees in 1788 on Bruny Island at Adventure Bay. Up north, the first site was at York Town in the Tamar Valley. The climate was agreeable and the apples stored well. When steamships got refrigeration in the 1890s the industry took off. ""That's when the real overseas market came to the fore, with frozen meat and then dairy and fruit being able to go,"" Ms Baker said. ""It changed the apple industry."" The Launceston apple exhibition of 1914 also sold Tasmanian apples to the world, with the advantage of being able to export into opposite seasons in Europe and South Africa. It was not without challenges, with codling moth introduced in the 1870s threatening the industry. Third-generation orchardist Andrew Griggs says the heyday for apples was from the 1940s to the 1960s, before England joined the European Union in the 1970s. ""Nobody had worked out how to store apples so we could come in with fresh, new-season apples when they didn't have any,"" he says. ""There was picking of a daytime and packing of an evening and stacking onto trucks early the next morning, and we had boats coming into Port Huon and Hobart as well as up north."" The government implemented a tree-pull scheme in the 1970s to get families out of the industry, and apple production in the state halved in just three years after peaking in the previous decade at seven million cases of export apples. Mr Griggs said his family's orchard at Lucaston in the Huon Valley shifted its focus from Europe to South-East Asia and the domestic market. ""Other countries were starting to produce more and more apples and our costs started to increase,"" he says. ""It became harder to get a price that was needed."" The introduction of controlled-atmosphere storage meant other countries could store apples longer and it was no longer a benefit to be counter-seasonal. Labour costs went up and packing requirements priced some growers out. Mr Griggs' father went overseas in the 1990s and saw that other apple growers were also producing cherries and he started to try it out in 1996. ""All of a sudden we had something we could export again,"" he says. It's estimated that in the 1960s there were 4,000 apple-growing families in Tasmania. Now there are about 20. More restructures of the industry are expected this year and almost no Tasmanian growers export overseas. ""Last year was an absolute disaster; we had a big crop and low sales and a huge amount of apples left over at the end of the season,"" Mr Griggs said. ""In Tasmania we've always got this disadvantage of freight costs across Bass Strait and we're always going to be $90 a bin worse off than somebody growing them in Victoria."" Mr Griggs says some smaller growers have told him it is becoming too hard and too marginal to grow apples. ""We're in the same category,"" he says. ""We're going to be taking out some less productive blocks and replanting cherries. ""Over time we will have more cherries than apples."" A good season two years ago was due to 30 per cent less crop being available, and Tasmania filled the gaps. ""That tells you if we were growing 30 per cent less, growers could make a living,"" Mr Griggs said. Tasmania is still growing apples, just on a small scale compared to local and interstate markets and has pivoted to ciders, juices and special varieties. ""The Apple Isle is much more a term we don't refer to ourselves as,"" Ms Baker says. ""I think it's more an imagined title. ""I like it. I think it's a nod to our heritage and the importance of the agricultural economy down here still. ""The connotations it brings aren't about apples ... it's about culinary tourism, it's shorthand for a foodie's paradise."" Ms Baker says the title can stay, but people perhaps should not take it literally. ""It's indicating a food and purity notion rather than specifically apples, as it was back in the day,"" she said.

68,Kangaroo trade in the balance as international buyers receive mixed messages,science,"  Kangaroo trade in the balance as international buyers receive mixed messages Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As animal activists pressure overseas markets to ban kangaroo imports over what they say are inhumane and unsustainable practices, the roo industry is launching its own campaign to try to sell its sustainability and welfare credentials. This month the industry will release social media videos about the benefits of roo meat and leather, targeting the European Union and United States markets. ""It's sustainable, it's renewable, it's environmentally friendly, so we're out there pushing it now,"" said processor Ray Borda who is also the president of Australia's Kangaroo Industry Association. The campaign, which is funded under a federal government program to help small exporters, comes as animal activists lobby the EU to stop the roo trade. Among them is filmmaker Mick McIntyre, who produced the controversial documentary Kangaroo: A Love-Hate Story. ""It's our role now, not just as filmmakers but as Australians, to stand up for the kangaroo and say is this really how we want to be treating a national icon,"" he said. Federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said he was deeply concerned about moves to shut down the EU market. ""It's predicated on misinformation around the industry here in Australia and that there are animal welfare issues and that there's also a sustainability issue,"" he said. Someone who has heard it all is Peter Absalom. He's been a commercial roo shooter for more than four decades and says it's more humane than other meat industries. ""They're out there enjoying themselves, doing what kangaroos do and then all of a sudden — whack,"" he said. Animal Justice Party MP Mark Pearson, who helped launch the NSW parliamentary inquiry into the health and wellbeing of macropods, says shooting devastates mobs. ""You know your father boom gone, mother boom gone, brother. You know this has an impact on these families,"" said Mr Pearson, who also recently introduced a kangaroo protection bill that, if passed, would prohibit shooting licences being issued in NSW. Under the industry code of conduct, commercial shooters must kill kangaroos with a headshot. While Mick McIntyre says he has evidence up to 40 per cent of kangaroos are miss-shot, the industry says its hit rate is better than 95 per cent. ""I can't remember the last one I missed,"" said Peter Absalom. ""Do you think I want to waste money missing roos? I just want kilos on the back and kilos in the chiller."" Spot checks of chillers are carried out in the field, and all carcases are inspected when they arrive at processors. But animal welfare groups say that is not enough. ""The most high-risk time of the whole operation is when the animal is being shot, and yet there is zero compliance monitoring of that activity,"" said RSPCA animal welfare advocate Rebekah Eyers. But Mr Borda said the processing industry would welcome more transparency. ""We know what we're doing is at a high standard,"" he said. One thing that really ignites the welfare debate is what happens to joeys after an animal is shot. While Peter Absalom doesn't shoot roos with big joeys, he says there are inevitable casualties because the mother often does carry young. ""It's either decapitation if they're small or a sharp blow to the back of the head if they're furred up,"" he said. The industry is funding research into alternative ways to kill the young, including using stun guns, but says the current practice is quick and humane. The RSPCA says there's too much room for error. ""If you can't guarantee a certain level of humaneness with a particular control method then maybe you shouldn't be using that method at all,"" said Rebekah Eyers. The federal Agriculture Minister says that's impossible. ""You are never going to get perfection,"" David Littleproud said. ""But so long as the protocols are in place and those protocols are adhered to, then that is the most sustainable and ethical way in which you can undertake this."" Kangaroos are protected under law in Australia. But the commercial industry and landowners affected by roos can apply for shooting permits for several species. Quotas are set at 15 to 20 per cent of populations, but state government regulators say normally only a fraction of the quota is reached. But just what those populations are and how much grazing pressure they pose are fiercely debated. ""We do not believe they're a problem,"" Mick McIntyre said. ""It's like fisheries, it's like ivory, it's like whaling. ""You extract wildlife, the wildlife run out and that is what we're seeing happening with the kangaroos."" Ecologist John Read says that's not true. ""Everywhere pretty much where dingoes are managed, there are overabundant kangaroos and they're causing big problems."" He's among a group of wildlife scientists who have released a statement endorsed by a range of conservation, Indigenous and farming groups on how to improve kangaroo management. ""The most sustainable, the most effective and the most humane tool to use is commercial harvesting."" And he says now is the time to develop a better management plan, with numbers that had dropped off after the last drought now starting to rise. ""In 18 months' time or two years' time we're going to have another one of these catastrophic emergencies where we've got millions of kangaroos dying of starvation unless we take really proactive measures now,"" he said.

69,"'No man's land': After 18 months of seeking help, Laura Jane's stuck in the bottleneck of the mental health system",science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Eighteen months after she entered ""a very dark space"", Laura Jane Picone says she still hasn't received any help. Ms Picone, 28, said she fell into a deep depression at the height of Melbourne's lockdowns in 2020. The social isolation caused by losing her job, living alone and being unable to see friends took its toll. ""I didn't see any light at the end of the tunnel, to be quite frank,"" she said. Ms Picone said she called Lifeline, hoping to be referred to a psychologist, psychiatrist or even a counsellor. She was added to long waiting lists, and the process was further delayed when she moved from the city to the country for a few months, and experienced domestic violence. ""I felt like I had spread myself pretty thin trying to contact numerous places for help, and I wasn't getting any results,"" she said. Ms Picone now is back at work in Melbourne and optimistic about her future, but still had ""some things I need to work through"". Ms Picone's case typifies the bottleneck many experience when trying to enter the mental health system. Possibly worse, however, is what leading youth psychiatrist Patrick McGorry calls ""the missing middle"". These are patients who haven't reached a crisis point yet, but have complex, prolonged needs that require a level of expert care. ""It's the no man's land between primary care and specialist or hospital care,"" Professor McGorry said. ""About half to two-thirds of young people are in that category, but they just simply cannot get through to that next level, because it has not been built around this country."" Professor McGorry, the director of research institute Orygen, said he was disappointed mental health had not featured more prominently in the election campaigns of the two major parties. ""It's pretty much radio silence so far,"" he said. In 2019-20, more than 4 million Australians received mental health prescriptions, and state and federal governments spent $11 billion on services — with about a third coming from the Commonwealth. In the 2020-21 budget, the federal government promised an extra $2.3 billion over four years for suicide prevention and early intervention programs, mental health treatment and bolstering the workforce. A further $650 million was promised in the budget released in March. Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues A Labor spokesman said the party would honour those budget commitments if it was elected. On the campaign trail, Labor has also promised to reverse a federal government funding cut for bulk-billed telehealth psychiatry sessions for people in regional and rural areas. Anthony Albanese said the program would support 450,000 consultations over four years and cost $31 million over the forward estimates. Meanwhile, the Coalition has been providing details on how it plans to spend money it had allocated towards mental health in previous federal budgets. This week, youth mental health organisation Batyr was announced as one of the beneficiaries, receiving $3.8 million in funding. Professor McGorry said the budget promises were ""a good starting point"" but the need for overall care was ""clearly not being met"". He said without adequate mental health funding there would be ""a lot of unnecessary deaths from suicide, futures lost and a weakening of the economy."" Melbourne psychologist Irene Robertson said her clinic had closed its waitlist for months, as staff worked through a growing volume of family break-ups and children experiencing anxiety and depression. ""There aren't enough clinicians to see the number of clients that are in need,"" Ms Robertson said. ""I feel like the effects of this pandemic will be seen for many, many years, especially for those that have lost businesses or completely disengaged from school."" For some already in the system, receiving ongoing treatment can also be a challenge. Brisbane woman Gabrielle Webster, 61, has battled bipolar disorder for three decades, a condition that she said cost her two marriages and relationships with her son and friends. It had also limited her ability to hold down a job in line with her university qualifications. Ms Webster, a disability pensioner, works part-time as a cleaner to afford monthly health insurance payments of $250, private psychiatry sessions and the 13 tablets she takes each day. ""I'm a rapid cycler which means I never have normal periods. I only have high or low. It's only now that I am able to function with the medication,"" she said. Ms Webster said she wanted to see more subsidies for psychiatry sessions and improvements to mental health wards in public hospitals. ""I think they're throwing money at it, but it's just not working,"" she said. ""Mental illness is on the increase and I still think there's a stigma attached to it.""

70,Is climate change a bigger concern for voters this election? This is what Google says,science," Science Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Discussion of climate policy may be conspicuously absent this federal election campaign, but Google search data suggests the warming of the planet is weighing on voters' minds — at least more so than in 2019. Catastrophic, climate-fuelled bushfires and floods have seen Australians asking Google what it's all about, experts say. Around the country, searches of climate-related questions including ""what is climate change meaning?"", ""how does climate change affect bushfires?"" and ""is climate change getting better?"" have increased more than 5,000 per cent since the last federal election. This data is normalised, meaning interest has increased relative to that of other topics. More people using Google doesn't explain why it's gone up. So, does the data on what millions of Australians are asking Google give us special insight into voters' collective concerns? Is climate change a bigger concern for voters this election? For the past year and a half, social researcher Rebecca Huntley has been conducting focus groups to understand the varying levels of concern with climate change among Australians. The Google search data broadly aligns with the focus group results. ""What we are seeing is people registering the unprecedented impacts of climate on the world today,"" she said. Various polls, from YouGov to readers' surveys, make a similar point: climate change is a hot-button issue. Vote Compass data shows an overwhelming number of Australians want more action to reduce carbon emissions. The basic theory as to why this is happening now rather than, say, three years ago, is ""stuff builds up"". As images of flooding fill our bulletins, it's important to remember that this isn't happening in a vacuum. Extreme weather is going to get more common under climate change. First, there were the 2019/20 Black Summer fires. These were not enough on their own to ""shift the dial"" on climate concern, but they were followed by two other major events, Dr Huntley said. One was the November 2021 COP26 climate conference in Glasgow that saw Australia criticised for inaction on climate change, including a net zero plan that was vague with details. The other was the 2022 floods in Queensland and New South Wales. While it's not yet possible to pin that individual weather event on climate change, it was consistent with predictions of the type of natural disaster we can expect to see more of under global warming scenarios. Basically, it was what climate change looked like. ""And suddenly it became a theme,"" Dr Huntley said. ""I genuinely think that the reason why you're starting to get people googling this stuff more is the fires, the floods, and the seemingly inadequate response of the federal government to that."" But the search data is more than just another poll, Dr Huntley says. It shows that climate change and the threat it poses is registering on a broad, grassroots scale with ""middle Australia"". ""These are people who may have never had a conversation about climate change with a friend or family member,"" she said. ""But they are suddenly asking questions and are curious enough perhaps not to raise it with friends and family, but at least to google it."" The idea that digital big data can give a window into cultural and social trends is known as ""culturomics"". The basic idea is that we lie to surveys, even when they're anonymous, because we want to look good (this is called social desirability bias). But certain online sources get people to admit things they would not admit anywhere else. And one of these is Google searches. Culturomics has been used for climate change before. A 2018 Australian study estimated awareness about climate change around the world using each country's Google search volume data. Carla Archibald, a co-author of the study, said Google search data can help researchers understand and track the broad level of public interest in a topic such as climate change. ""Google searches can be used as a barometer … to measure communities' awareness of climate change,"" said Dr Archibald, who is now at Deakin University. ""We can learn about society's collective questions or concerns by summarising the frequency or sentiment of Google search terms."" Australia, by the way, already ranked high for awareness of climate change in that study. In the intervening years, the latest search data would seem to suggest that awareness has gone right up. So who's quietly googling about climate change? The list of the top places searching the topic may give us some insight. The results are dominated by towns and townships with tiny populations, which suggests the rankings may not be totally reliable (it could be skewed by one family, for instance). But, at the very least, the search data shows that some people in these areas are curious enough about climate change to ask Google. At the top of the list is Koetong, a one-pub township in north-east Victoria with a population of 20. The co-owner of the pub, Shelley, was surprised to learn Koetong had come top, given climate change was not something people talked about much when they were out in public. ""We're a farming area,"" she said. ""Maybe it has something to do with the bushfires."" The locality was evacuated in January 2020 and narrowly avoided the firefront that destroyed dozens of nearby homes. Australia is going to face an ""insurability crisis"" in under a decade as climate change forces insurance premiums to ""skyrocket"", a report from the Climate Council warns. Sixth on the list of top places googling climate change is Toobeah (pronounced ""two beer""), a one-pub inland rural town of 191 people in Queensland, near the border of New South Wales. Locals there were also mystified by the ranking. ""I wouldn't say it was a topic that comes up at the bar,"" one man said. Lawrence Springborg, mayor of the local Goodiwindi Shire and president of the Queensland Liberal National Party, proposed people were searching ""because they don't believe"" climate change and wanted ammunition to disprove the science when the topic came up in conversation. ""I have absolutely no idea why they're searching,"" he added. Another reason may be the recent floods, and expert predictions that a warming atmosphere will make this type of natural disaster worse and more frequent for parts of Queensland like Toobeah. Climate change may not be a topic at the bar, but it's having an impact. The Toobeah Hotel recently held an information evening for flood recovery grants. Across Queensland, a state that's known for electing politicians that question the scientific basis of climate change or campaign against action to reduce emissions, search interest in climate change has increased 43 per cent since the last federal election. So Australians are googling climate change, even if they're not talking about it. And in areas where they're talking about it least, they may be googling it even more than elsewhere. ""Maybe they can ask Google when they can't ask their neighbour,"" Dr Huntley said. ""It's not a surprise to me that people in small farming communities, where they don't necessarily feel like they can have this conversation at the pub, are places where people are googling it."" See how a town can adapt to severe storms and bushfires in this award-winning ABC augmented reality experience. Rebecca Colvin, a social scientist at ANU, agrees. In late 2021, she conducted dozens of interviews with farmers around NSW affiliated with Farmers for Climate Action, a movement of rural Australians who want more progress on climate change. Dr Colvin found that the 2019/20 Black Summer bushfires (this was before the recent floods) had been a catalyst for people in rural areas of NSW to talk about ""this thing called climate change"". But the topic still had to be treated with caution. ""This was described as a legacy of the way climate change has been politically and socially divisive in the past,"" she said. ""Some of the farmers I spoke with talk to their neighbours about changing weather patterns, but steer clear of the c-word."" The surprised reaction of people in areas like Koetong and Toobeah was ""quite in line"" with the results of her own research, she said. ""It shows how important it is we find a way to talk productively about these contentious issues. ""There's this gap between what are we thinking about versus what we think is socially acceptable to talk about.""

71,COVID-19 vaccination no longer mandated at Adelaide Zoo but masks required for up-close animal experiences,science,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog From tomorrow Zoos SA will no longer require patrons to be vaccinated, but it will require people taking part in up-close animal experiences to wear masks to prevent the creatures from catching COVID-19. Some ""animal experiences"" — as Zoos SA calls chances to feed animals and get near them — will still not be brought back, such as those with great apes because the risk of transmission is still too high. People will have to wear masks when getting close to lions at the Monarto Safari Park and meerkats, pandas and red pandas at Adelaide Zoo when the ""animal experiences"" return. Children under five years old will be included in the mandate. Adelaide Zoo director Phil Ainsley said there was ""definitely a genuine risk to animals in zoos"", with some animals overseas contracting COVID-19 from visitors and then dying. ""What we do know is that, very similar to the presentation in humans, the impacts of COVID may vary depending on the COVID variant. So, for example, [with] the Delta variant there is definitely some recordings of deaths in animals in zoos in the northern hemisphere,"" he said. ""At the moment there is information which we're still waiting to see emerge, [like] how the Omicron variant is impacting zoo animal collections, but to date there has been no proven case of COVID-19 in a zoo animal collection in Australia that we're aware of."" Zoos SA brought in a COVID-19 vaccine mandate at the Adelaide Zoo and the Monarto Safari Park in December 2021, angering some people who had paid for annual memberships but had not been vaccinated. Dr Ainsley said the zoo would be glad to welcome them back. ""Obviously, all of our members are very valuable to us as an organisation, and we really have been grateful for their support previously and ongoing through the pandemic,"" he said. ""Definitely, we've had conversations and it's a great opportunity for them to come back on site."" Zoo animals have caught COVID-19 overseas and, more rarely, wild animals have caught the virus. Pets have also caught it but there is no evidence they can pass it on to humans. There is no registered COVID-19 vaccination for animals in Australia. Masks will still be required on the Zu-loop bus around Monarto, as they are on all passenger transport in South Australia. South Australia recorded 2,874 new COVID-19 infections today.

72,'They were right': Manager of child protection reform told nothing would change and she was wasting her time,science,"  Child protection reform manager tells Tasmania's commission of inquiry that out-of-home care system is broken Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Sonya Enkelmann started work as a project manager for out-of-home reform in Tasmania's Communities Department she soon had something of a reality check. ""I was told by a senior policy person that nothing would change and that I was wasting my time,"" Ms Enkelmann said. ""I remember looking at them and going, 'Well if we take that approach we might as well give up now. But they were right.'"" Ms Enkelmann worked in the role for three years from 2017–2020. On Friday she gave evidence to the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings. She said it was the first time she had worked in child safety and what she encountered was a system under strain. ""There's a hesitancy for genuine, open consultation when I was there, there's much more interest in trying to maintain control of the message, which I think is a sign of an organisation that's under stress,"" Ms Enkelmann said. ""It became very apparent to me very quickly that the department had a reputation of being very closed and very defensive, its approach was often considered to be crisis driven and reactive."" The current inquiry into sexual abuse in Tasmania has opened wounds, with one expert saying the ""unexamined dark past"" of the prison island has a lot to answer for — made worse by lingering shame and a compulsion for secrecy. The department is responsible for children who are removed from their homes and placed into foster care. ""It's understandable that there can be fear and reluctance to hold yourself open but, to be honest, I suspect that we actually perform better than we think we do in some ways, that it isn't always doom and gloom,"" Ms Enkelmann said. ""We have a lot of great outcomes for children and young people in out-of-home care because of those children and young people, their own resilience and their own capacities, and the people around them: the carers, individual workers — we have some stirling individuals in the system and we achieve some wonderful outcomes because of that. ""But I would say it's because of those individuals and their relationships that they've developed, rather than as a deliberate result of the system."" Ms Enkelmann told the commission that case workers, whose job includes supporting carers and children in out-of-home care, had ""ridiculous"" workloads, which meant they were not able to support the children or carers adequately in many cases. She said there was a high turnover of case workers and that while the nature of the work was difficult, dealing with out-of-home children was not what was driving them away. ""My sense in terms of talking to people was … that it wasn't the children and young people that were the issue or that the whole process of working in that environment. It's actually the organisation, the system around it that's the frustrating thing,"" she said. A lack of support for carers and children can cause further problems for already vulnerable children, Ms Enkelmann said. ""If it is the case that we're not supporting our carers effectively, and the child ends up having a breakdown in the home, or multiple breakdowns in the home, then we are, as a system, magnifying those vulnerabilities to child sexual abuse, to grooming behaviours. ""Because there are perpetrators out there that can pick a person a mile away who is going to be more amenable to grooming, who has unmet needs, who is isolated, who doesn't have a sense of being loved, who doesn't have a sense of self-worth. ""That's is the worry that I have, that we don't meet children's needs early enough and, when we don't do it well, we can actually magnify those unmet needs and those vulnerabilities in the future. ""There is always going to be homes that unfortunately will break down for some reason, but I think at a system level where we're having this consistently, I would see it as a sign of system failure. ""We're failing those children and we are failing those carers, and for the workers [in the department] it's equally frustrating because they know that they could have done better, that they could have provided support and they could have prevented it happening in the first place."" When asked about what could be done to improve the system, Ms Enkelmann said: ""If we actually implemented so many of the recommendations that have been made before — we have had many, many reviews into out-of-home care and government will say, 'Yes we accept them in full', and then nothing happens, or very little happens."" She said the frustration for people working on the frontline was not about change, but that they do not see change happening where it matters. ""There's all this talk of change and change fatigue, but nothing actually changed on the frontline where it actually really counted in terms of resources for kids, or resources for carers, or capacity for the workers to actually be able to do their job,"" she said.

73,'You'd never expect it out here': The outback startup bridging a tech divide,science,"  Outback agtech startup brings innovation to the bush, helps graziers monitor water levels Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For decades, central-west Queensland grazier Neil Rogers has spent the first two hours each day the same way. Wake up, jump in the ute, and drive to each water tank on the 17,400-hectare Toobrack Station, south of Longreach, to check vital water levels. It's an expensive and time-consuming chore that's been a fact of life for the longest time. But not anymore. These days, his routine looks a lot different, courtesy of some little boxes sitting on top of his tanks. ""We get up in the morning and look at our iPad and go, 'Here are our water levels'. We know where to turn taps on, we know if we've got to go and check something,"" Mr Rogers said. ""It's saved us unbelievably on running costs. It's a big help."" Agricultural technology, or agtech, is nothing new, but far away from the resources and industry of the major cities, the innovations of a small outback startup are popping up on remote stations. OPS Australia is a Longreach-based startup that collaborates with local graziers to develop technology that monitors water, fences, and gates. The company was recently awarded $99,560 under the state government's Advance Queensland Ignite Ideas Fund, which supports regionally based innovators and entrepreneurs. CEO Andrew Barton said, based on two major rural events, outback agtech companies were few and far between. ""Last year in May, there was Beef Week [Beef Australia], and apparently there were something like 70 agtech vendors, both in cattle solutions and water-monitoring solutions,"" Mr Barton said. ""But then when you come to Westech [field days], OPS was the only agtech vendor there providing smart monitoring and control solutions, and the drive between Rocky and Barcy [Barcaldine] is only a few hours, but there seems to be a terrific divide. ""It appears that we're the only vendor providing smart agtech services for western Queensland."" Mr Barton said that was because the outback could be a difficult place to cater for. ""It's not an easy environment. The sun is tough, the roads are tough, and the people are tough,"" he said. ""A coastal company that puts a solution together that works perfectly well on the coast typically has an issue when it moves out west. ""So often, western Queensland needs to put solutions together to meet our own needs."" Being able to rely on locally developed technology for solutions to locally specific issues is something that Mr Rogers welcomes. ""When they first came up and talked about it, we all sort of went, 'Oh technology,'"" Mr Rogers said. ""Then we started talking about what they were going to do, and how the world is going ahead now, and it's big positives all the way. ""I think it's one of the greatest things for the area, and to get agtech out in the country, in the central west, is the best thing that's ever happened."" Longreach State High School student Lachie Horne, 16, said he had been interested in IT and computers for a while now but faced a lack of opportunities to gain experience in the outback. That changed when his schoolmate Harrison Moore told him there was somewhere in town where he could sink his teeth into software and web development. ""It's very surprising. That's the problem when you're living out in a rural place,"" Lachie said. ""You don't have all the opportunities, and I think this has been a really good opportunity to get that experience because you'd never expect it out here in a remote community."" Lachie spends his time working on a web portal that gives property owners access to their water levels from the comfort of their home and notifies them if those levels are dropping. ""I thought it'd be very good to get some of that experience, so I ended up joining OPS, and that's been helpful for giving me that experience and letting me learn about web development and get into that job field,"" he said. ""For locals, by locals"" is something that's core to Mr Barton's vision for his startup. ""We're just continuing to find good people within the central west, be they electrical engineers, high school students. There's a whole range, but we're actually building up the team with terrific local people,"" Mr Barton said. Want more local news? Sign up for the weekly ABC Western Qld email newsletter Chad Renando, a University of Southern Queensland research fellow in Innovation Ecosystems at the Rural Economies Centre of Excellence, said graziers often encountered technology without understanding the nuances of the challenge.

""The actual execution requires you to maintain it and be able to support it, as well as handling the challenges that are inherent too — remote location, connectivity, and internet infrastructure.

74,Employers using software monitoring is now the new norm. Here's how some workers get around it,science," Science Employee monitoring software became the new normal during COVID-19. It seems workers are stuck with it Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog In early 2020, as offices emptied and employees set up laptops on kitchen tables to work from home, the way managers kept tabs on white-collar workers underwent an abrupt change as well. Bosses used to counting the number of empty desks, or gauging the volume of keyboard clatter, now had to rely on video calls and tiny green ""active"" icons in workplace chat programs. In response, many employers splashed out on sophisticated kinds of spyware to claw back some oversight. ""Employee monitoring software"" became the new normal, logging keystrokes and mouse movement, capturing screenshots, tracking location, and even activating webcams and microphones. At the same time, workers were dreaming up creative new ways to evade the software's all-seeing eye. Now, as workers return to the office, demand for employee tracking ""bossware"" remains high, its makers say. Surveys of employers in white-collar industries show that even returned office workers will be subject to these new tools. What was introduced in the crisis of the pandemic, as a short-term remedy for lockdowns and working from home (WFH), has quietly become the ""new normal"" for many Australian workplaces. For many workers, the surveillance software came out of nowhere. The abrupt appearance of spyware in many workplaces can be seen in the sudden popularity of covert devices designed to evade this surveillance. Before the pandemic, ""mouse jigglers"" were niche gadgets used by police and security agencies to keep seized computers from logging out and requiring a password to access. Plugged into a laptop's USB port, the jiggler randomly moves the mouse cursor, faking activity when there's no-one there. When the pandemic hit, sales boomed among WFH employees. In the last two years, James Franklin, a young Melbourne software engineer, has mailed 5,000 jigglers to customers all over the country — mostly to employees of ""large enterprises"", he says. Often, he's had to upgrade the devices to evade an employers' latest methods of detecting and blocking them. It's been a game of cat-and-mouse jiggler. ""Unbelievable demand is the best way to describe it,"" he said. ""When Zoom became a thing [along with] activity status and employee tracking, it became almost an expectation for people to have them."" And mouse jigglers aren't the only trick for evading the software. In July last year, a Californian mum's video about a WFH hack went viral on TikTok. Leah told how her computer set her status to ""away"" whenever she stopped moving her cursor for more than a few seconds, so she had placed a small vibrating device under the mouse. ""It's called a mouse mover … so you can go to the bathroom, free from paranoia."" Others picked up the story and shared their tips, from free downloads of mouse-mimicking software to YouTube videos that are intended to play on a phone screen, with an optical mouse resting on top. The movement of the lines in the video makes the cursor move. ""A lot of people have reached out on TikTok,"" Leah told the ABC. ""There were a lot of people going, 'Oh, my gosh, I can't believe I haven't heard of this before, send me the link.'"" On the other side of the world, in New York, EfficientLab makes and sells an employee surveillance software called Controlio that's widely used in Australia. It has ""hundreds"" of Australian clients, said sales manager Moath Galeb. ""At the beginning of the pandemic, there was already a lot of companies looking into monitoring software, but it wasn't such an important feature,"" he said. ""But the pandemic forced many people to work remotely and the companies started to look into employee monitoring software more seriously."" In Australia, as in other countries, the number of Controlio clients has increased ""two or three times"" with the pandemic. This increase was to be expected — but what surprised even Mr Galeb was that demand has remained strong in recent months. ""They're getting these insights into how people get their work done,"" he said. ""Even when some companies have returned back to office work, they still rely on employee monitoring software."" The most popular features for employers, he said, track employee ""active time"" to generate a ""productivity score"". Managers view these statistics through an online dashboard. Advocates say this is a way of looking after employees, rather than spying on them. Bosses can see who is ""working too many hours"", Mr Galeb said. ""Depending on the data, or the insights that you receive, you get to build this picture of who is doing more and doing less."" But those being monitored are likely to see things a little differently. Ultimately, how the software is used depends on what power bosses have over their workers. For the increasing number of people in insecure, casualised work, these tools appear less than benign. In an August 2020 submission to a NSW senate committee investigating the impact of technological change on the future of work, the United Workers Union featured the story of a call centre worker who had been working remotely during the pandemic. One day, the employer informed the man that monitoring software had detected his apparent absence for a 45-minute period two weeks earlier. The submission reads: Unable to remember exactly what he was doing that particular day, the matter was escalated to senior management who demanded to know exactly where he physically was during this time. This 45-minute break in surveillance caused considerable grief and anxiety for the company. A perceived productivity loss of $27 (the worker's hourly rate) resulted in several meetings involving members of upper management, formal letters of correspondence, and a written warning delivered to the worker. There were many stories like this one, said Lauren Kelly, who wrote the submission. ""The software is sold as a tool of productivity and efficiency, but really it's about surveillance and control,"" she said. ""I find it very unlikely it would result in management asking somebody to slow down and do less work."" Workers say Amazon's Melbourne warehouse is a dehumanising, insecure and sometimes unsafe workplace. Ms Kelly, who is now a PhD candidate at RMIT with a focus on workplace technologies including surveillance, says tools for tracking an employee's location and activity are nothing new — what has changed in the past two years is the types of workplaces where they are used. Before the pandemic, it was more for blue-collar workers. Now, it's for white-collar workers too. ""Once it's in, it's in. It doesn't often get uninstalled,"" she said. ""The tracking software becomes a ubiquitous part of the infrastructure of management."" More than half of Australian small-to-medium-sized businesses used software to monitor the activity and productivity of employees working remotely, according to a Capterra survey in November 2020. That's about on par with the United States. ""There's a tendency in Australia to view these workplace trends as really bad in other places like the United States and China,"" Ms Kelly said. ""But actually, those trends are already here."" In fact, a 2021 survey suggested Australian employers had embraced location-tracking software more warmly than those of any other country. Every two years, the international law firm Herbert Smith Freehills surveys thousands of its large corporate clients around the world for an ongoing series of reports on the future of work. In 2021, it found 90 per cent of employers in Australia monitor the location of employees when they work remotely, significantly more than the global average of less than 80 per cent. Companies are turning to technology to keep track of their employees' productivity. But some experts are concerned, and say a simple weekly catch-up could do more good. Many introduced these tools having found that during lockdown, some employees had relocated interstate or even overseas without asking permission or informing their manager, said Natalie Gaspar, an employment lawyer and partner at Herbert Smith Freehills. ""I had clients of mine saying that they didn't realise that their employees were working in India or Pakistan,"" she said. ""And that's relevant because there [are] different laws that apply in those different jurisdictions about workers compensation laws, safety laws, all those sorts of things."" She said that, anecdotally, many of her ""large corporate"" clients planned to keep the employee monitoring software tools — even for office workers. ""I think that's here to stay in large parts."" And she said employees, in general, accepted this elevated level of surveillance as ""the cost of flexibility"". ""It's the quid pro quo for working from home,"" she said. The short answer is yes, but there are complications. There's no consistent set of laws operating across jurisdictions in Australia that regulate surveillance of the workplace. In New South Wales and the ACT, an employer can only install monitoring software on a computer they supply for the purposes of work. With some exceptions, they must also advise employees they're installing the software and explain what is being monitored 14 days prior to the software being installed or activated. In NSW, the ACT and Victoria, it's an offence to install an optical or listening device in workplace toilets, bathroom or change rooms. South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland do not currently have specific workplace surveillance laws in place. Location tracking software may be the cost of WFH, but what about tools that check whether you're smiling into the phone, or monitor the pace and tone of your voice for depression and fatigue? These are some of the features being rolled out in the latest generation of monitoring software. Zoom, for instance, recently introduced a tool that provides sales meeting hosts with a post-meeting transcription and ""sentiment analysis"". Software already on the market trawls email and Slack messages to detect levels of emotion like happiness, anger, disgust, fear or sadness. The Herbert Smith Freehills 2021 survey found 82 per cent of respondents planned to introduce digital tools to measure employee wellbeing. A bit under half said they already had processes in place to detect and address wellbeing issues, and these were assisted by technology such as sentiment analysis software. Often, these technologies are tested in call centres before they're rolled out to other industries, Ms Kelly said. ""Affect monitoring is very controversial and the technology is flawed. ""Some researchers would argue it's simply not possible for AI or any software to truly 'know' what a person is feeling. ""Regardless, there's a market for it and some employers are buying into it."" Back in Melbourne, Mr Franklin remains hopeful that plucky inventors can thwart the spread of bossware. When companies switched to logging keyboard inputs, someone invented a random keyboard input device. When managers went a step further and monitored what was happening on employees' screens, a tool appeared that cycled through a prepared list of webpages at regular intervals. ""The sky's the limit when it comes to defeating these systems,"" he said. And sometimes the best solutions are low tech. Recently, an employer found a way to block a worker's mouse jiggler, so he simply taped his mouse to the office fan. ""And it dragged the mouse back and forth. ""Then he went out to lunch.""

75,Farmers accuse supermarkets of 'ripping off' consumers amid fresh produce price-hike,science,"  Farmers accuse supermarkets of 'ripping off' consumers amid fresh produce price-hike Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Farmers say they are not benefiting from any price-rise of fresh produce at supermarkets, amid accusations that retailers are price gouging. NSW Farmers Horticulture Committee chairperson Guy Gaeta said supermarkets were pocketing extra profits made through price rises. ""People are paying more for their fruit and veggies at the supermarket, but the farmers aren’t selling them for more, so who's really raising the prices here?"" he said. ""Sure you’ll get a little lift in prices because of the cost of fuel, but not like we’ve seen at the checkouts recently. ""They're ripping off the farmer and they're ripping off the consumer."" Dave Parsonage is a fruit and vegetable farmer near Condobolin in central-west New South Wales. He and his wife Diane were often shocked by how much the supermarkets marked up prices. ""It's atrocious, a lot of it,"" Mr Parsonage said. ""Iceberg lettuces were $3.80 [at the] Flemington markets [but they were] $7.50 in IGA, $6.90 at Coles."" NSW Farmers president James Jackson said the issue stemmed back to the ""ongoing failure of Australian competition laws"". ""Any of those highly perishable goods are at the mercy of the supermarket duopoly,"" Mr Jackson said. “We’ve suffered for years due to poor competition policy in this country and it's got to be fixed. ""My challenge to all the parties in this election is, 'Let's do something about it'."" But Australian Retailers Association (ARA) chief industry affairs officer Fleur Brown blamed the price rises on inflation and supply chain issues. ""For at least the next 12 months, we are expecting inflation to have an impact unfortunately, so we do need to brace ourselves for some price rises,"" she said. She said accusations of price-gouging were not true and supermarkets were seeing a drop in profits as well. ""Woolworths reported a reduction in its profit margin in Australian food most recently from 5.7 per cent to 5.1 per cent,"" Ms Brown said. The company recorded a $1.79 billion net profit result in the 2021 financial year. Many apple growers have said it has become increasingly hard to receive a profit on their produce. John Evans is selling part of his Geeveston farm, south of Hobart, off the back of shrinking margins and flat demand, especially for older apple varieties. He said his returns were unlikely to be good enough to continue. ""We took a 40 per cent pay cut last year,"" the sixth-generation orchardist said. ""How many times can we do that?"" Fruit Producers South Australia chief executive Jose Gil said the state's apple growers had been struggling to break even amid the rising cost of production. Mr Gil said he would like to see more transparency and supported a review into produce pricing. ""There certainly needs to be a review [to] make sure that the growers are actually … getting the money that they need to be able to continue to provide produce,"" he said. ""Otherwise we'll be looking overseas for produce and that's the last thing we need in this country.” We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

76,Gympie family's close call as mysterious metal object crashes through ceiling,science,"  Unidentified metal object falls through Gympie family's roof, narrowly missing baby bouncer Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A young family in Gympie has survived a bizarre ordeal after a heavy piece of metal crashed through the ceiling of their home overnight, narrowly missing their baby's bouncer. Tenika Lawther said she was still in shock after the unidentified object rocketed through the roof and into their tiled floor just after seven o'clock last night. She said her five-month-old daughter, Oceana Gardner, was sitting in the bouncer moments earlier and would have certainly been killed if she was struck by the metal that was around 3 centimetres in length. ""It was very scary,"" she said. ""If my daughter was sitting in her bouncer she would be dead."" Ms Lawther said her partner, Matthew Gardner, was holding Oceana in the kitchen of their home on Old Maryborough Road eating ice cream when they heard the loud bang. ""There was smoke and debris everywhere,"" Ms Lawther said. ""We both just looked at each other and right above his head and my daughter's head was this hole in our roof. ""It flew straight past my head onto the couch so, yeah, any of us could have died last night and not known it was coming. It was horrible."" Ms Lawther said she was trying to work out what the object was and where it came from. The couple initially contacted police who told them it was not a police matter. ""They said just get up and put a tarp over your roof and then you need to fix it and probably get compensated for it,"" she said. The pair have posted pictures of the mystery metal fragment on social media and have been inundated with suggestions on its origins, with everything from bullets to space junk and aviation debris. ""We definitely don't think a bullet; we've ruled that out,"" she said. ""We don't think it's possible, so we think it may have come from an aeroplane or a helicopter, if it came through the roof smashing at that speed it needed to come from a height. ""We're not sure if it was space junk, because it's sharp, and it looks like it's come off something."" Ms Lawther said she wanted to get to the bottom of it so other people were not injured or hurt. ""We just need to find someone who can confirm if there was something going over at that time and to have a look at the plane or helicopter to see if it's damaged because people could be in danger as well,"" she said. The couple would reach out to their home insurer to get the damage repaired. ""We're very confused as to what it is,"" she said. ""So it went through the tin on the roof, there's a complete hole, and then a hole straight through our gyprock and then tiles, so two holes and the tiles are smashed. ""We'd love to know if someone's responsible and who's gonna pay for it because now, obviously, we need to go through our home insurance and fix all of this.""

77,'It's the same as chicken or beef': Dog food with surprise ingredient makes sustainable meal,science," ABC Rural Dog food made from maggots a sustainable meal deal cooked up by former RSPCA vet Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Dogs love to eat some pretty dodgy things, so it is no surprise they are enjoying food made from maggots. Formerly a veterinarian for the RSPCA, Stephanie Stubbe grew up on a beef farm at Splitter's Creek outside of Albury. She has created a dog food product made from dried fly larvae that she hoped would lead to more environmentally friendly pet food. ""Essentially the black soldier flies are farmed, like you would any meat product, except they require 98 per cent less energy, 96 per cent less water, and also a lot less waste [than red meat],"" Ms Stubbe said. ""They make a complete protein that's much more sustainable and is also hypo-allergenic. ""Many dietary allergies in dogs are caused by red meat so this idea is about creating a healthy protein that is more sustainable."" The larvae are harvested in laboratories in Victoria and Western Australia and have a 26-day life cycle. ""At the 13-day point, they are harvested, dried, and turned into a meal. ""It's the same as chicken or beef meal, and looks and feels the same as the product that goes into kibble."" The black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens, could help solve our food shortages by feeding livestock. The product is more expensive, however, Ms Stubbe believed as the industry evolved costs would come down. ""Black soldier fly larvae protein is more expensive than red meat, but we're not out there to compete against the big players,"" she said. ""We're happy to take a hit on that margin to ensure we're providing a good product. ""More and more players are coming online and with more production, the cost will come down."" Ms Stubbe started her business, Anipal, to drive sustainable change in the vet industry. ""I've always been interested in what ingredients go into pet food,"" she said. ""Most of the vet industry is an altruistic community; we're concerned about the environment."" Most pet food is created from off-cuts from abattoirs, and Ms Stubbe was not against red meat dog food. However, she said there needed to be room for more options. ""The fact of the matter is that we don't have enough red meat for humans, and for off-cuts to be going to the growing pet consumer space … we need to provide more sustainable resources,"" Ms Stubbe said. ""A lot of pet food is being sold as human-grade, quality product. That's pushing your prime meat ingredients into the pet space when it should it be going into the human space. ""We can use a whole variety of ingredients for pets. ""It's not about one or the other, but about providing more alternatives."" Ms Stubbe said the pet food space was exciting at the moment as more options opened up. ""The most essential thing is that we are providing the healthiest dietary options possible for our pets,"" she said. ""Studies backed by literature, backed by experience from the medical and veterinary field, show we can provide anything. ""A new study out recently from the UK is suggesting that you can look after a dog just as well on a vegetarian or vegan diet."" Ms Stubbe said she saw many options in the future for pet food including the use of seaweed and fungi. ""I'm a big believer in fungi. It can be an incredible protein as well, and you can grow it in a range of environments,"" she said. ""We have a very unique, native seaweed that I'm working with a former CSIRO scientist on for our product line."" Ms Stubbe also believed carp could be used as a future source of protein for pets. ""The protein in carp is ideal for pets, so we could be helping reducing pests in rivers,"" Ms Stubbe said. ""There's a whole bunch of things we could be doing and it's exciting to be in this space, really.""

78,"Bum-breathing Irwin's turtle resurfaces in Queensland river after 20 years, delighting scientists",science,"  Bum-breathing Irwin's turtle resurfaces in Queensland river after 20 years, JCU researchers say Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A bum-breathing freshwater turtle has conquered water turbidity and crocodiles to re-surface in the Lower Burdekin River for the first time in more than 20 years. The Elseya irwini or Irwin's turtle first came to the attention of scientists in the 1990s when it was caught in the Lower Burdekin River. The species was named after naturalist Bob Irwin — Steve Irwin's father — who made the discovery. James Cook University researchers thought the species would not survive environmental conditions in the area. The university's Tropical Water and Aquatic Ecosystem Research (TropWATER) study, led by researcher Cecilia Villacorta Rath, has formally confirmed the presence of Irwin's turtle in the Lower Burdekin for the first time since the 1990s. Dr Villacorta Rath said the current thought was that the species had disappeared from the area. ""Since the Burdekin Falls Dam was built, the ecosystem changed dramatically, and the water now has high levels of turbidity all year round,"" she said. ""There was this hypothesis that the species wouldn't survive under these environmental conditions. ""However, we have found trace DNA of this species in many areas downstream from the dam, and this indicates the species is currently there."" The researchers collected water samples from 12 sites in the Lower Burdekin via helicopter. Using an Environmental DNA method, or eDNA, they found the Irwin's turtle genetic material in multiple samples. ""If we think about these turtles that spend their whole time underwater or a fish, or a frog that also spends time underwater, there is shedding of cells,"" Dr Villacorta Rath said. ""If we simply collect a sample of the water, then we are also collecting all those cells that contain the DNA of all the species that have been there."" The eDNA method has been a breakthrough for researchers who have struggled to conduct visual surveys of the turtles. The Irwin's turtle will rarely surface to breathe. ""They can breathe through their noses like other freshwater turtles, but they [mainly] breathe through their cloacas — their bums,"" Dr Villacorta Rath said. Snorkelling surveys are also not possible in the Lower Burdekin due to the presence of crocodiles. Dr Villacorta Rath said the new data on the Irwin's turtle would inform conservation efforts. ""Environmental DNA is a sensitive tool for the detection of cryptic species such as the Irwin's turtle,"" she said. ""The species especially not listed under the EPBC Act, Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act because there is lack of data. ""This can aid sound conservation measures for the species."" The Irwin's turtle is commonly found in Broken River and Bowen Creek but has been considered rare in the Burdekin region.

79,'Sky candy' will be visible all over Australia this weekend. Check out our handy guide,science," Science Eta Aquariid meteor shower 2022: what you can expect to see around Australia Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australian sky watchers will be treated to a meteor and planet show this weekend as long as the skies are clear. The annual Eta Aquariid meteor shower can be seen on Saturday and Sunday morning from anywhere in Australia a couple of hours before sunrise. While the shower peaks on the weekend, you might also catch some on Friday morning and early next week. The Moon will have set before the point in the sky where the meteors come from — known as the radiant — rises above the eastern horizon. And this year they will be easy to spot with a stunning line-up of four bright planets pointing where to look,   amateur astronomer Ian Musgrave says. ""There'll be lots of interesting sky candy just below where you're looking for the Eta Aquariids."" You'll see Venus and Jupiter just above the eastern horizon. ""If you follow the line between Venus and Jupiter up you'll see red Mars, and the shower radiant should be just about where Mars is."" Above that is the golden orb of Saturn. The Eta Aquariids is one of the best meteor showers in the southern hemisphere, second only to the Geminids in December, says Jonti Horner, an astronomer at the University of Southern Queensland. Each year Earth passes through a stream of debris laid down by Halley's Comet, with the meteors appearing from a point in the constellation of Aquarius in May and Orion in October (aka the Orionids). ""The Eta Aquariids are a better shower than the Orionids because we're passing more towards the middle of the debris stream, so we get much better numbers,"" Professor Horner says. Meteor rates will be consistently good wherever you are in Australia, but the further north you are, the better. ""From most of Australia, on the morning of the 7th and 8th, we'll see around about 20 meteors per hour,"" Dr Musgrave says. ""For those of us who are up near Darwin and Cairns and places like that, it will be closer to 24 meteors per hour."" Predicted meteor rates across Australia Location May 6 May 7 May 8 May 9 May 10 Adelaide 14/hr 17/hr 20/hr 17/hr 14/hr Brisbane 15/hr 18/hr 22/hr 18/hr 15/hr Canberra 14/hr 17/hr 20/hr 17/hr 14/hr Darwin 16/hr 19/hr 22/hr 19/hr 16/hr Hobart 13/hr 16/hr 18/hr 15/hr 13/hr Melbourne 14/hr 17/hr 20/hr 16/hr 14/hr Perth 15/hr 18/hr 20/hr 17/hr 14/hr Sydney 14/hr 17/hr 20/hr 17/hr 14/hr And good news if the weather is iffy: the Eta Aquariids have a broad peak, so they are also visible for a few days before and after the weekend. ""You're not missing out if it's cloudy because [meteor] rates tend to stay high for a couple of days either side of maximum before falling off,"" Professor Horner says. The show starts once the radiant rises above the horizon around 3am, and gets increasingly better towards dawn, until the meteors are washed out in the twilight. You'll see more if you are somewhere away from the city lights, but you can still see some from the suburbs, Dr Musgrave says. ""You see plenty that are bright enough that are easily visible to the unaided eye."" Firstly, you need to get comfortable. You'll be outside for a while because meteors don't come in a regular pattern, so rug up and take a camping chair. You don't need anything special to see the meteor shower, but you might like to take a telescope or binoculars to get a good view of the planets while you are waiting. But if you do take binoculars or a telescope, you need to be careful, Dr Musgrave says. ""If you're spending all your time looking through the telescope you'll miss the meteors; it's a bit hard to do both."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. To catch meteors, you need to scan the sky rather than stare at one spot. ""Let your eyes move around because even though the radiant is at the point where the meteors appear to originate from, most of them start burning or glowing away from that point,"" Dr Musgrave says. Pay attention (because these meteors are fast) and look for faint vapour trails. ""They're quite swift and they can produce persistent trails when the meteor goes past … sometimes high-altitude winds will twist these trails into interesting shapes,"" Dr Musgrave says.

80,Study prompts concerns about antibiotic resistance in the food chain,science,"  Antibiotic resistance detected in the food chain could have implications for human health, new study finds Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A new study has found surprisingly high rates of antibiotic resistance in samples of salmon and beef purchased from Australian supermarkets. The study, shared exclusively with 7.30, was commissioned by animal rights not-for-profit World Animal Protection and carried out by researchers at Melbourne's Monash University. The researchers looked at how well antibiotics worked against bacteria in salmon and beef and also searched for what antibiotic-resistant genes the micro-organisms might be harbouring. These genes can jump between bacteria, and from bacteria to humans through consumption. ""Alternatively, you would also have these genes potentially passing into wastewater, for instance, and then also causing environmental contamination,"" said Associate Professor Chris Greening from Monash University. Fifty-five per cent of the beef samples and 39 per cent of the salmon samples were found to be harbouring resistance to a range of commonly used antibiotics. ""It's a concern. The levels of antimicrobial resistance in these meats was much, much more than we were expecting,"" Mr Greening said. ""We can't really conclude exactly how the antimicrobial resistance in these meats was acquired. ""What's clear is, because of the very high levels of antimicrobial resistance, they're probably exposed to antibiotics at some point, but we can't determine in what context and for what purpose."" It's possible that cooking the meat reduces the risk of transmission. But Mr Greening said not enough was being done to monitor antibiotic resistance in the food chain. ""What Australia desperately needs is basically an integrated surveillance system for both antimicrobial usage as well as antimicrobial resistance levels,"" he said. ""We also need to be looking at animal health, we need to be looking at food, we need to be looking at [the] environment."" Food Standards Australia New Zealand said it would be monitoring antibiotic resistance from June 2022 as part of a new study looking at antibiotic resistance in Australian food. It said it was analysing the research from Monash University. Coles, Woolworths, and Aldi all declined to be interviewed. In a statement, a spokesperson for Woolworths said the company takes food safety seriously and relies on ""the expert guidance of national authorities who set science-based regulations for the livestock industry and animal medicine"". The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment also told 7.30 in a statement that the study's findings ""are not reflective of current antimicrobial usage practices"" in Australia's beef or salmon industry. Antibiotic resistance is becoming a global problem that could make infections much harder to treat. ""Antibiotic resistance is where antibiotics no longer work because bacteria produce chemicals that inactivate the antibiotic, and that's a real problem,"" said Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at the Canberra Hospital. ""There's people already dying around the world because they're getting infections that we can no longer treat. ""And as the projections go for the future, they're talking about millions of extra people dying per year because antibiotics don't work. ""It just shows why we have to be very careful with the volumes of antibiotics we allow to be used, the types that are used, and how we let it spread. ""If we don't have transparency of what's happening with real-time or near real-time data, then it's very hard to police this."" The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) said it is responsible for approving antibiotics, but that it is up to state and territory regulators to monitor how much is used. A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture also told 7.30 that the department is in the initial planning stage for ""a nationally coordinated One Health Surveillance System that will collect and report on antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial use"" across sectors including agriculture, food and animal health. Bryce Camm runs his family's cattle company in Queensland's Darling Downs. He's well aware that antibiotic resistance is a serious issue, and says he tries to limit his use of antibiotics. The only part of Mr Camm's business where antibiotics are used is to treat disease among cattle in the feedlot. ""We'll use antibiotics when we have a beast with an ailment, that might have had a cut or an abrasion,"" Mr Camm said. ""Or it might have a respiratory [illness] or something like what we would call the flu in humans. ""Before we can use an antibiotic on any animal, it has to be authorised or signed off by a veterinarian. ""So Australia has some of the lowest usage of antibiotics in the world."" Mr Camm says he is working hard to avoid making the problem of antibiotic resistance worse. ""Antimicrobial resistance in the management of antibiotics, both in human health and animal health, is an emerging issue globally,"" he said. ""[It is] something that the beef industry ... takes very seriously. ""We understand how crucial it is to maintain the efficacy of those important medicines that we have today. ""We're always very conscious of emerging issues for consumers and ensuring that we're delivering a safe and nutritious product onto the plate. ""And hence, we have been world-leading in implementing stewardship guidelines around the use of antibiotics."" A Department of Agriculture spokesperson told 7.30 that Australia had adopted ""one of the most conservative approaches to the use of antimicrobials in agriculture in the world"", and that the registration process for antibiotics for use on food-producing animals takes a ""science and risk-based approach"". ""Australia has a national antimicrobial resistance strategy that reflects the shared responsibility of human health, agriculture and environment and the best available scientific knowledge of this topic,"" the statement said.

81,"Global study shows period stigma 'all encompassing', with conversations key to change",science,"  Global study highlights menstrual stigma, with conversations key to change, UWA researcher says Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog New research shows periods ""produce a range of adverse personal impacts"" for people around the world, with shame and stigma exacerbating the burden of menstruation. The study was completed across various institutes, including the University of Western Australia. It compiled data from more than 10,000 people from high and low-income countries. UWA lead researcher Dani Barrington said social stigma was a huge barrier to menstrual health across the board. ""This stigma, it's all-encompassing around the world, and it's having really negative impacts on people, even in countries where they can afford to buy menstrual products,"" Dr Barrington said. ""If we are going to sustainably achieve good menstrual health for everyone, we must do more than throw free pads at the problem."" Dr Barrington said talking honestly about menstruation was the key to change. She said open conversations could foster more menstruation-friendly environments, especially in workplaces. ""We need to try not to be embarrassed to talk about it,"" Dr Barrington said. ""It's about having an environment where people who have periods feel they can take leave when they need to … making sure they have facilities, that they can leave meetings if they need to because they've had an event where they desperately need to get to the bathroom."" While menstruation is traditionally considered a ""women's issue"", Dr Barrington said everyone should work to destigmatise periods. ""There is more formal education of boys [these days], but there is still a lot more we need to be communicating to men,"" Dr Barrington said. She said part of the problem was crass stereotypes and outdated jokes about periods. ""That's what a lot of people who don't have periods are exposed to — so having more education around the reality [of menstruation] is really useful,"" Dr Barrington said. Dr Barrington's research also highlights the role women have to play in supporting people who struggle with their periods. ""We saw in a lot of cases, women would go to work really sick, or would say they couldn't go to work because they weren't feeling well enough, and other women would chastise them for it, saying, 'My periods aren't that bad, so yours can't be either,'"" she said.

82,Divers call for a pause on recreational fishing after retrieving 10km of fishing line from Gold Coast Seaway,science,"  Sea Shepherd and Environmental Divers retrieve 10km of discarded fishing line from The Spit Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An estimated 10 kilometres of discarded fishing line has been removed from the Gold Coast Seaway, with a diving group calling for a pause on recreational fishing in the area so it can rejuvenate. More than 40 divers pulled the debris from a popular recreational spot at The Spit during a clean-up event over the weekend. ""It's pretty horrifying to be removing that from the environment,"" Sea Shepherd marine debris campaigner Grahame Lloyd said. ""That is by no means clean down there. ""We removed as much as we could in a time frame."" Mr Lloyd said it had been an ongoing problem in the area, with about 4.5 kilometres of fishing line pulled out of the seaway during a smaller clean-up during November. ""There's risk to marine animals,"" he said. ""We're seeing marine birds caught in this fishing gear and there's the human impact for people swimming that may end up getting one of these hooks in their feet or get tangled up. ""I'm sure that the majority of fishermen are not responsible but they just need to self-regulate and pull up people who are leaving this fishing line sitting around."" A spokesperson for the Gold Coast Waterways Authority (GCWA) said specially designed tackle and fishing line bins were installed in the area in 2017. ""[GCWA] doesn't limit the number of people, including fishermen, in Doug Jennings Park and on the Seaway Promenade as these are community spaces,"" the spokesperson said. ""We encourage people to use these areas responsibly and make sure they leave them clean."" Volunteer group Environmental Divers retrieved about 8 kilograms of discarded fishing line, hooks, rods, and other debris from the seaway during the clean-up. President Peter White said the rocky environment meant it was easy for fishers to get snagged and ""every time they snap their line off, they're losing between 30 and 50 metres of fishing line"". He said recreational fishing in the area should be paused to give the environment time to recover and ""rejuvenate"". ""We're going to let the divers get on with it, clean it up, and get rid of all the fishing line,"" Mr White said. ""Fishing techniques are never really going to change enough. ""There's always going to be fishing line down there."" While GCWA ruled out any restrictions to recreational fishing, the spokesperson said it was open to partnering with community clean up efforts. ""GCWA is open for discussions and partnerships with community and volunteer groups that help keep the waterways clean and protect the marine life."" Mr White said the problem had been ""getting worse"" since he started scuba diving in 1990. ""I can't remember that amount of fishing line [being] there, and it's only really been in the past five years that we've started doing clean-ups there because I noticed how much fishing line there was,"" he said. ""Every time we go there we still remove the same amount — if not more. ""The biggest problem is that it forms like these massive spider webs and it's very easy to get entangled."" He said even if visibility was good, people would not see the fishing line and could become entangled in it. ""And then you just continue to wind yourself up and get more and more entangled,"" Mr White said.

83,Mystery condition eating away turtle shells and 'exposing bones' after flooding,science,"  Green sea turtle shells eaten away by mysterious condition following flooding near K'gari (Fraser Island) Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A mystery disease eating away at green sea turtle shells has been discovered by researchers on Queensland's Fraser Coast. The number of cases has been rising since the region's flood events earlier this year. Researchers said they were continuing to find turtles with sections of skin and scales shedding from the upper part of their shell. University of Sunshine Coast associate professor in animal ecology Kathy Townsend said it was the first time the disease had been documented in sea turtles. ""We've seen a large number of turtles coming in with this disease where the shell of the turtle is really soft and spongy and, at the top of it, the scales are starting to slip off,"" she said. ""In extreme cases it is leaving bones exposed."" Dr Townsend said they had recorded 30 cases so far, with most of them occurring after the flooding. ""There was one or two with anecdotal evidence showing that they might have had it prior to the floods,"" she said. ""[But] post floods we've definitely had a large surge in cases."" Dr Townsend said the cause of the disease could be due to a number of factors but it remained ""a bit of a mystery"". ""Along with Turtles in Trouble, we have been working alongside Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service as well as the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital and Central Queensland University,"" she said. ""There is pathology that is currently being done to find out whether this is bacterial or viral, and [if] it is caused by pollutants or is it a parasite. ""We are also looking to see if this disease is localised and if it is just being found in the Fraser Coast region."" Dr Townsend said if it was viral, or bacterial, there was a possibility that animals could spread it to one another. ""If it is caused by a pollutant, then no, it would just depend on whether that pollutant is present or absent,"" she said. Turtles in Trouble coordinator Ali Hammond said the disease had led to the deaths of some turtles. ""We've certainly seen some turtles that we've picked up in the earlier stages that have gone to rehab,"" she said. ""They've gone downhill to the point that they have had to be euthanised because they've gotten so sick from it. ""In rehab now they've actually had some success with treating a few of the turtles and some of them are actually quite stable and appear to be recovering, which is really exciting."" Dr Townsend has called on other rescue groups to be aware of the disease. ""Superficially it looks like a boat has skimmed it and knocked the scales off the top of the shell,"" she said. ""Unless you're actually looking for the way this disease presents, you may miss it.""

84,"Oyster harvesting is in Lorraine Woolley's blood, and she has a message for the industry",science," Science Indigenous people sustainably harvested oysters for thousands of years before European colonisation, study finds Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Oyster harvesting is in Lorraine Woolley's blood. The Butchulla woman's great grandfather and grandfather harvested oysters in the waters around Urungan and Burrum Heads in south-east Queensland. ""My grandfather would go down and eat the oysters off the rocks while us kids played,"" she remembers. ""There were a lot of oysters, they weren't even in beds, they would be attached to the mangroves in clusters."" Warning: Indigenous people are advised there are images of middens in this story. Lorraine's people harvested oysters well before her great grandfather arrived from Ireland in the 1870s. There are many mounds of shells dotted all over her country, says Ms Woolley, who is the chairperson for the Butchulla Native Title Aboriginal Corporation in Hervey Bay. But there are no longer any original oyster beds in the area. Ms Woolley says the oysters disappeared because of disease and over-exploitation by European settlers, who took the oysters further south to Moreton Bay in the late 1800s. ""My great grandfather wrote a letter and asked them to stop doing it because he said they were robbing the banks,"" she said. ""[Oyster beds] are like vegetable gardens. You've got to replant a vegetable garden, and they just kept taking them out."" The collapse of oyster beds is a story familiar to Indigenous people in many coastal regions of Australia, as well as the US. A new study, published today in the journal Nature Communications, looks at the scale of oyster harvesting before the arrival of Europeans in both countries to see what the modern industry could learn from Indigenous practices. ""There's a lot of talk about the collapse of oyster fisheries due to overfishing and all sorts of other problems during the 19th and 20th centuries, but [previous studies] don't go further than that,"" said the study's lead author Lesley Reeder-Myers, an anthropologist at Temple University. From the Snowy River to Central Australia, respect and connectedness to the land are key Indigenous values. But the new study of oyster mounds in south-east Queensland and several sites in the US indicates that Indigenous oyster fisheries were sustainably managed on a massive scale for up to thousands of years without widespread crashes. ""These fisheries … were sustainable for a really long time and it's not an isolated event,"" she said. The study indicates that Indigenous knowledge of oyster harvesting practices could help restore the health of oyster beds today. But that's not the most important finding, Dr Reeder-Myers said. ""It's about the fact that these people have been divided from their ecological heritage for hundreds of years in some cases, and that restoring them is a justice issue."" Ian McNiven, a professor of Indigenous Archaeology at Monash University, was one of the study's co-authors and is well known for his work with Indigenous communities in south-east Queensland. ""We should be involving First Nations communities in the management of marine resources where they have their own ancestral fisheries that go back thousands of years,"" Professor McNiven said. ""In the past, a lot of people have thought that, 'it is nice to include Indigenous people but given that their levels of resource extraction [were] so low, of course it was sustainable, and it's not really helpful for the modern age'. ""But what we are saying is when you look at the archaeology, some of the levels of First Nations oyster exploitation [were] unbelievably extensive."" One of the oyster sites that Professor McNiven studied in Australia includes the Booral shell mound on Butchulla country. The 1.5-metre-high mound has been dated up to 3,300 years and contains more than 5 million shells. In parts of the US, such as Florida, some shell mounds are higher than 9 metres, Dr Reeder-Myers said. ""I've seen one of these towers and my jaw just dropped, I was blown away,"" she said. ""This isn't that different from fisheries after European arrival. These are on a huge scale."" Dr Reeder-Myers said that it was unclear from the study whether or not oysters were intentionally farmed in the way we know it today. ""They were very aware of how their ecosystem worked … but to what extent they were building intentional structures or doing something we would call aquaculture, we don't know with this dataset,"" she said. Finding out whether Indigenous people harnessed the intertidal area in the same way they used fire to shape the land and fish traps on inland streams was the next step in research, Professor McNiven said. He said there was evidence some groups may have farmed oysters. ""The Quandamooka people of Moreton Bay have very strong oral histories where they would get the oysters that were collected and instead of putting the shells into the middens, they would take a lot of the shells back out onto sandbanks and create, in a sense, artificial reefs for the oyster larvae or spat to grow,"" Professor McNiven said. ""There is a possibility that the extraordinary level of extraction of commercial oyster fisheries in the late 19th century may have been living off thousands of years of Indigenous farming of oysters. ""I think we've got a lot to learn, and a lot of that is going to involve talking to contemporary First Nation communities."" Further south, Mitch Gibbs, a marine biologist and Dunghutti man, is working with three Indigenous land councils and the NSW government to restore cultural connections to the oyster beds in the Sydney region. ""In Australia, we've lost about more than 99 per cent of our Sydney rock oyster reefs and we've lost more than 92 per cent of our flat oyster or mud oyster reefs,"" said Dr Gibbs of the University of Sydney. ""Unfortunately there's been a huge decimation of our reefs since colonisation."" Many reefs were crushed to make concrete and lime. Dr Gibbs welcomed the findings of the new paper. While it's still early days for his work, he said people were becoming more open about working with Indigenous people to improve the management of oyster reefs. ""[Consultation] needs to be done properly and make sure that community members are engaged in that process,"" he said. ""In places where I've worked, there are Aboriginal elders within those environments and countries, and the information they have is astronomical."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Dr Gibbs said knowledge of different ecological systems varied from country to country. But beyond ecological value, he said it was also important to understand that many shell sites have spiritual and cultural significance. ""Shells were really important and used for a huge variety of things,"" he said. ""Specific middens can be more spiritual than others based on people buried there, or based on the uses over time."" Back on Butchulla Country, Lorraine Woolley hopes the modern oyster industry can learn something from Indigenous people. But she is unsure about how much Indigenous knowledge is left in her area. ""I don't know if there's enough people left around; maybe in other places, but not in Hervey Bay."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

85,Highest turtle nesting season on record near Pilbara mining operations,science,"  Highest number of nesting turtles on record at Bells Beach in WA's Pilbara region Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog This year's nesting season at a small, sandy beach in Western Australia's Pilbara region has seen the most mother turtles on record, according to a local monitoring program. West Pilbara Turtle Program coordinator Sarah McDonald said the record result coincided with growing interest in volunteering for track monitoring. The monitoring occurs on sandy beaches near Wickham and Cleaverville, including Bells Beach near Rio Tinto's Cape Lambert Port Operations in the state's north-west. This summer, it seemed Bells Beach was the place to be for nesting flatback turtles. Ms McDonald said can take individuals up to 20 years to reach breeding maturity. She said while the team was still sorting out its preliminary data, it was a ""great"" nesting season. ""We had some great nesting this year with lots of turtles coming to nest at Bells Beach,"" she said. ""[It's] the highest we've had on record and so naturally you get more hatchlings when there's more nesting."" The program is a partnership between Rio Tinto and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions. Ms McDonald said while it was difficult to determine what exactly caused this year's influx of turtles, there were several possibilities. ""Turtles are interesting creatures and there's so much we don't know … it could be to do with their food sources,"" she said. Flatback turtles, the most common turtle species found at Bells Beach, do not nest every season, which Ms McDonald said could also have contributed to the record number of nests. ""They only come back every two, maybe five seasons, so it might just be that last season they had quite a low nesting season and this year, they were already to nest again,"" she said. ""It could be to do with just natural fluctuations in nesting, but it is an area that needs a lot more study."" Ms McDonald said this season also saw some success for hatchlings, which could be attributed to the absence of major weather events this summer. ""[Cyclones] can really impact the hatchlings at the end of the season where they might get trapped in the sand from a hard layer been formed by the rain or they might get inundated by the tide from those big tides that come with cyclones,"" she said. ""We know we have about just over 80 per cent this year who made it out of the nest, which is pretty good."" Ms McDonald said interest in volunteering for the turtle monitoring was growing around Karratha, Wickham, Roebourne and Dampier. ""The program wouldn't exist without our volunteers, so we're always so grateful for everyone that gets involved and this year, we had an excellent team,"" she said. She said not only were people signing up to volunteer but also passing on the message about the importance of protecting turtles. ""[They're] telling their friends and family not to drive on beaches, at nesting time telling people to keep their dogs away from hatchlings and turtle nests, and just generally doing really good support for turtle conservation and spreading the message to look after these amazing creatures.""

86,Is Google a publisher? That is the question the High Court is being asked to consider,science,"  High Court asked to decide if search engine giant Google is a publisher of content Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Google and Melbourne lawyer George Defteros are set for a showdown in the High Court of Australia over whether the search engine giant is classified as a publisher or not. Mr Defteros successfully sued Google in 2020 for $40,000, after it failed to take down a story he said had defamed him. The story was originally published in The Age newspaper, and detailed how, in 2004, Mr Defteros had been charged with conspiracy and incitement to murder underworld figures, including Carl Williams. But in 2005 the charges were withdrawn. The initial ruling found that the article had conveyed the defamatory imputation that the respondent had crossed the line from professional lawyer for, to confidant and friend, of criminal elements. Mr Defteros had reached a settlement by way of mediation, with the author and publisher of a book that had included a chapter based on the Age's article, in 2010. In 2016, a removal request was made to Google, which was still directing searches to the article. Google refused after it emerged the lawyer who made the application had misrepresented the situation, when he said Mr Defteros had sued the Age and it had agreed to remove the article as part of a settlement. Mr Defteros had not sued the Age and the newspaper had not agreed to remove the article, although it did take it down in December 2016. Submissions by Google to the High Court rejected the assertion the link to the story amounted to publishing. ""A hyperlink is not, in and of itself, the communication of that to which it links,"" lawyers for Google said in their submissions. ""Just as in the case of a modern-day telephone call, where the caller communicates directly with the listener … with no publication by the company itself."" But lawyers for Mr Defteros said Google was an active participant. ""The Google search engine is not a passive tool, such as the facility provided by a telephone company,"" submissions from Mr Defteros argue. Google also argued it had a common-law qualified privilege defence. But in their submissions, lawyers for Mr Defteros suggested they would tell the court that qualified privilege only applied if the person searching had a legitimate interest in the information beyond gossip or curiosity. His lawyers said that the common law rules about publication were clear, and there should be no special rule for providers of hyperlinks. ""Publication including to users without a legitimate interest is not privileged,"" the submissions said. Both sides have referred to last year's landmark High Court ruling, which found major media companies were liable for comments posted on their Facebook pages about Northern Territory man Dylan Voller. Mr Voller's treatment as a detainee sparked a royal commission into the Northern Territory's youth detention system, after images of him shackled to a chair wearing a spit hood were revealed by the ABC's Four Corners program. Lawyers for Google said the ruling affirmed that the process in which a defamatory matter was communicated must be active and voluntary, which it argued it was not. But lawyers for Mr Defteros said Google was the publisher under principles developed by the Voller ruling, by facilitating and providing a platform, even if it did not intend to communicate the defamatory matter in question. ""The search result enticed the searcher to click on the hyperlink,"" submissions from Mr Defteros said. The hearing is expected to last a day.

""A lot of people look at me when I'm paddling and wonder what's going on,"" she said. ""The belly is definitely protruding over my legs now and it's a little bit harder to rotate and paddle properly, so it does look a bit odd. ""I am not ready to finish paddling just yet."" The 29-year-old represented Australia in sprint kayaking at the 2016 Rio and 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Wood said her decision to continue paddling while pregnant surprised many who had assumed she would retire from the sport. ""That really kind of hurt me … so I've been quite vocal about what I'm doing and what my intentions are,"" she said. ""There's not a lot of research in the area, so we're kind of going in a little bit blind. ""We're taking things as they come, which is a little bit scary, but pretty exciting to try to set a precedent and pave the way for girls in the future."" The Australian Institute of Sport is conducting research into pregnant athletes and women's health. Wood's training data is being monitored by CQUniversity (CQU) senior lecturer Melanie Haymen, who is based in Rockhampton. ""What we know in the field is quite limited because pregnancy was seen as time for rest,"" she said. ""Twenty years ago we wouldn't have been able to fathom that we would have women exercising during pregnancy, let alone elite athletes. ""With Alyce, we are able to get a better understanding of what these women are actually capable of and what we might be able to do moving forward with elite athletes and recreational athletes during pregnancy."" Wood said it was not unusual for women in other countries to continue canoeing after becoming a mother. ""At the Tokyo Olympics, every podium had a least one mum on it,"" she said. ""In Australia, it's more unusual. The last person to fall pregnant, have a baby, and come back was my mother-in-law. ""My husband is now 28 so it's been a long time since it's happened in Australia."" Anna Wood won a bronze medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, two years after giving birth to her son Jordan Wood, who also represented Australia in kayaking. Paddle Australia women's sprint kayak coach Rene Olsen said it was only the second time he had coached a heavily pregnant athlete. ""There has been a lot of females, top athletes, who have gone through pregnancies and come back,"" he said. ""We have a very good plan of what we're trying to achieve and the things that Alyce is trying to achieve this year are different from the rest of the group. ""Alyce has been heavily involved in deciding her program and how it fits around her pregnancy."" Olsen said Wood's training regime would make her return to the sport easier once she delivers her baby. ""Alyce is listening to her body and making adjustments when she's feeling things differently,"" he said. ""It's about good planning, but being able to flex when you need to."" Wood said she was not sure when she would stop paddling. ""I'll paddle until I'm uncomfortable, but at the moment I'm 32 weeks pregnant and still comfortable in the boat,"" she said. ""Once the belly gets bigger you physically can't fit in the boat and once that happens I'll transition out into different cross training."" That will include gym work, swimming, and riding a stationary bike. Wood is due to give birth in June and her goal is to represent Australia at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

88,Your home could be 'uninsurable' by 2030. Here are the top 10 electorates most at risk,science," Science Climate change means 1 in 25 homes could become uninsurable by 2030, report warns Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog About one in 25 Australian homes are at high risk of becoming effectively uninsurable by 2030, according to a new Climate Council report based on analysis by a climate risk assessment group. That number rises to more than one in 10 homes for some of the most affected regions, including parts of Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Greater Shepparton, Ballina and Port Adelaide. The report authors warn that Australia is heading for an ""insurability crisis"" as climate change increases the risk of worse weather extremes, resulting in ""skyrocketing"" insurance premiums. ""We're talking about half a million properties — it's not insignificant,"" said Nicki Hutley, report co-author and economist with the Climate Council. ""This has implications for every single taxpayer in Australia."" Of the top 10 electorates to be impacted, most (80 per cent) are due to the increasing insurance risk posed by riverine flooding, according to the ""Uninsurable Nation"" report, which was released on Tuesday. Bushfire and surface-water flooding, or overland flooding not associated with river swelling, also feature prominently in pushing insurance premiums higher in the coming years. When a property becomes ""effectively uninsurable"", it means the insurance premiums are so high as to be unaffordable to the average home owner, according to Karl Mallon from Climate Valuation, who provided the Climate Council with the data. Once there is more than a 1 per cent chance in any given year of a property incurring major damage from an extreme weather event, that's when premiums start to escalate, Dr Mallon said. ""Once you exceed that threshold, typically the costs start to increase; so instead of paying $1,000 a year, you get $3,000 a year and it climbs — we've seen premiums of $30,000 a year,"" he said. ""Essentially, we stand by the view that once you get above these levels, there will be many people who cannot afford this insurance."" Had trouble getting insurance for your home? We'd love to hear from you. You can contact us at science@abc.net.au. Had trouble getting insurance for your home? We'd love to hear from you. You can contact us at science@abc.net.au. Queensland is projected to be the hardest-hit state, with up to 193,000 properties (6.5 per cent of the total number) deemed to be at high risk of uninsurability by 2030, followed by New South Wales with more than 148,000 properties. The findings were based on a business-as-usual, high emissions outlook for climate change. Dr Mallon said what banks and insurance companies choose to base their premiums on varies, but they're required to factor in business-as-usual forecasts. Let's break down the climate change policies of the major parties: Coalition, Labor and Greens. ""The kind of guidance coming out from the governing regulatory bodies in Australia and around the world, they almost all insist that every company have a view on the high emissions scenarios,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, that's where we're tracking, is along those pathways."" At this stage, the high emissions scenario is looking likely through to 2030, Ms Hutley said. ""What we call the high emissions, worst-case scenario is the path we're currently on with no pathway adjustments,"" she said. ""This is actually what we're facing down if nothing happens [and] with the 2030 scenario, most of that [warming] is already baked in."" The report also includes an interactive map with moderate and best-case emissions scenarios, where users can explore outcomes through to 2100. ""Even under the moderate scenario, things still don't look that great,"" Ms Hutley said. In the federal electorate of Nicholls in Victoria, which includes Shepparton, Moira, Campaspe, Mitchell and parts of Strathbogie Shire, as many as one in four houses are predicted to move into the insurance ""high risk"" category by 2030. Strathbogie mayor Laura Binks said her community was ""already living the reality of climate change right now"", but she was still surprised to see how at-risk the Strathbogie Shire could become. ""Seeing this report, yes, it's the high emissions, worst-case scenario outlook for our community, but it's really alarming and arresting,"" Councillor Binks said. In 2021, Strathbogie became the 100th council in Australia to declare a climate emergency. Councillor Binks said this report had reinforced the need to get emissions down. As images of flooding fill our bulletins, it's important to remember that this isn't happening in a vacuum. Extreme weather is going to get more common under climate change. ""We'd absolutely welcome meaningful [climate] action at the state and federal level that the scientists are telling us we have to take,"" she said. Councillor Binks said there were already a number of climate-positive projects in the Strathbogie Shire, including a microgrid at Euroa and carbon-neutral wineries, but that building resilience against future extreme weather events posed a bigger challenge. ""It's certainly a part of the work that our operations and engineering teams are doing, is looking at ways we can build resilience,"" she said. ""[But] the challenge we have at Strathbogie is we have a large area but a fairly small rate base."" That means the council can't generate the revenue locally to invest in expensive infrastructure projects. ""What we'd love to see is more meaningful support and partnering from state and federal governments,"" Councillor Binks said. ""We don't want to see rural and regional places get left behind."" Our changing climate could soon make it harder to get a mortgage on the Queensland coast. We had three properties assessed, with mixed results. Climate Valuation calculated the data used in the report with a program that input variables including flood mapping, elevation, and forest cover, combined with global climate models, to assess the ""upper range"" of risks posed to every address in Australia. Assuming an average house cost of $314,000 (it was $320,000 last year according to the ABS), they then calculated what is called the MVAR, or maximum value at risk, for each property. Houses that scored an MVAR of 1 per cent, which means that extreme weather was likely to cost them on average 1 per cent of the value of their property each year — $3,140 based on the assumed average house cost — were deemed to be at ""high risk"" of becoming effectively uninsurable. Because extreme weather events happen with a degree of random probability, jumps in insurance premiums can be difficult to predict. However, Dr Mallon says that, in general, insurance companies and banks have been underestimating the growing risk of climate change. ""Unfortunately, we think it's not going to be a smooth curve from here over the next five years,"" he said. ""We think there's going to be some bumpy corrections."" What people need to understand, he said, is that while a 1 or 2 per cent chance of an extreme weather event might sound low to the property owner, to an insurer, that could be an unacceptable risk and cause for boosting premiums. ""Everyone is saying, 'What's the statistical probability of an extreme weather event?'"" Dr Mallon said. ""If I was a home owner, I'm more worried about what the insurers and banks are going to do, than what is the possibility of an event coming through.""

A spokesperson for the Insurance Council of Australia says climate change is ""worsening extreme weather events, which has implications for affordability and availability of insurance"". ""At present there is no area of Australia that is uninsurable, although there are some locations where there are clearly affordability and availability concerns,"" the spokesperson said. ""Insurance [assesses] risk, and that means that for those in flood-prone or cyclone-prone locations, cover can be costly.

89,Shearwater shock: Dozens of dead birds found in coastal town for fourth straight year,science,"  Dozens of dead shearwaters found in Port Fairy for fourth year in a row Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Dozens of dead juvenile short-tailed shearwaters have been found strewn across a lawn outside a popular tourist attraction in south-west Victoria for a fourth straight year. The short-tailed shearwater, or mutton bird, is one of Australia's most common and hardy birds. Each year the birds clock up more than 32,000 kilometres, following the warm weather between the northern and southern hemispheres as they chase an ""eternal summer"". About 50 juvenile short-tailed shearwaters were this week found strewn across a lawn near a popular breeding ground at Griffiths Island in Port Fairy, three-and-a-half hours west from Melbourne. The cause of death remains unknown, and Victoria's Department of Environment and Moyne Shire Council have been notified. Port Fairy's short-tailed shearwater population has endured a horror run over the past four years. Alarm bells were raised in 2019 when the 40,000-strong colony was uncharacteristically late to arrive to its south-west home. A significant number of shearwater deaths were recorded that summer and again in 2020. Things were looking brighter last year, with colony numbers bouncing back before this weekend's latest kill. It is understood the juvenile birds were expected to leave the island this week to follow their parents north to Alaska for the summer. The Moyne Shire Council sent staff to collect the birds on Sunday. ""It’s understood artificial light may have an impact on the fledglings,"" a council spokesperson said. ""As such, council has taken steps to reduce artificial light in the area around Griffiths Island. ""The light in the rotunda at the entrance to the island causeway will be switched off until after the fledglings have migrated."" The council is also investigating if other lighting in the area can be lowered or switched off during fledging, while still ensuring safety of the public. The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said its investigations remained ongoing. ""The cause of the deaths isn’t known. DELWP officers have collected a sample of the birds for assessment,” a spokesperson said.

90,Secret koala colony on Sydney's doorstep raises hopes there could be more,science,"  Citizen scientists uncover hidden koala population at Heathcote National Park near Sydney Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Koalas are now an endangered species in New South Wales, with the Koala Foundation estimating their numbers have declined by 41 per cent in the three years until 2021. But what if there were pockets of bushland where they exist in significantly larger numbers than expected? Two citizen scientists have photographed and named nearly 80 previously undocumented koalas on the southern outskirts of Sydney at Heathcote National Park, across the road from the more famous Royal National Park. The discovery has raised the possibility there could be more koala colonies out there. ""One day, we went for a bit of a poke around the western part of Heathcote National Park, and we thought maybe there are some koalas around here,"" nature lover and koala spotter Steve Anyon-Smith said. ""We had a look at the very first tree, and there was a koala, and then we thought, wow, maybe there are some more."" Four or five koalas located during initial searches with fellow spotter Tom Kristensen quickly grew to 32 over three months. They are now close to sighting 80 individual koalas, with the possibility of many more in the immediate area. ""We've always known there are koalas in this landscape because their favourite food trees are here,"" Mr Anyon-Smith said. ""But you don't just stumble across them. You really have to search for them. ""For something that is bigger than a bread box and sits up in a tree in the middle of the day, it's amazing how easily they can blend into the foliage, and you can just walk straight past them."" The pair said they catalogued each individual with a photo of their unique face and gave them a name. Mr Kristensen was convinced a search beyond the boundaries of Heathcote National Park would locate more. ""It's a relatively small area, but it adjoins a lot of other wild areas,"" he said. ""We've got Holsworthy military base, we've got the water catchments down there [in the Illawarra and Southern Highlands], across the highway, we have got the Royal [National Park]. ""The koalas seem to be doing well here, possibly because there's a good supply of water coming from the Woronora Dam. ""There is a permanent environmental flow, so they can always find somewhere to have a drink."" The NSW National Parks Association (NPA) is one of several organisations committed to the protection of koalas, so the new population is a welcome find. NPA executive officer Gary Dunnett said Mr Anyon-Smith and Mr Kristensen put in the time to make the find. ""I think that what we have seen over recent decades is a string of koala records from Heathcote, "" he said. ""But it was only when Steve and Tom actually put the days and weeks in that people realised it was more than just the occasional vagrant from further out west, the big population out near Campbelltown. ""And what we actually have is a vibrant population right here sitting in the shadows of Sydney at Heathcote."" Saul Deane from Sydney's Total Environment Centre has kept a close watching brief on the Campbelltown population in south-west Sydney. He believed koalas were now returning to lands where they used to live before being driven out by bounty hunters in the 1920s. ""They were almost hunted to extinction — like the Tasmanian tiger,"" Mr Deane said. ""And it has taken 80 years for their numbers to slowly build-out and move back into the areas they used to occupy."" Mr Deane would like to see research into koala numbers in the Water NSW Special Areas, which are closed to the public to protect water storage and infrastructure for Sydney and the Illawarra. He would also like to see research into how underground mining in these areas could impact koala health. ""It's completely likely there might be a consequence, and that is an area where research would be encouraged,"" he said. A spokesperson for the NSW Department of Planning and Environment said it was working on listing 20 new asset-of-intergenerational-significance declarations within the national park estate for koalas by 2026. The declarations are intended to protect the most important habitat for threatened species, but there is no detail yet on where that will occur. ""The koala populations of south-west Sydney and the Southern Highlands have been identified for investment and action in the koala strategy, and details will be released once finalised,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

91,"Ksenia Borodin needs to survive the 'next two years' until she gets a heart-lung transplant, doctors say",science,"  Young cardiac patient Ksenia Borodin embraces her life while she hopes for a heart-lung transplant Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog On bad days, Ksenia Borodin gets exhausted just getting out of bed and walking the few metres to her kitchen. She avoids stairs as much as she can and sometimes even talking leaves her breathless. At just 22, doctors have told her a heart and double-lung transplant is her only option for long-term survival. But the part-time Brisbane law student, who was born with complex heart problems, says she has never felt like giving up amid a lifetime of ""near-death experiences"". ""I just kind of go along with my day,"" she said. ""I just think, if it's meant to be, it'll be, and, if I'm going to go, I'll go — none of us makes it out of here alive. ""We all have to deal with our own mortality at some point and I've just had to deal with it at a young age — in a way, I'm lucky to be able to accept that because I think a lot of people are terrified [by] it."" Mater cardiologist Mugur Nicolae said Ms Borodin was born with a large hole in the centre of her heart and problems with the valves that control blood flow — a condition known medically as a complete atrioventricular canal defect. ""Instead of having a four-chamber heart, she essentially has a two-chamber heart,"" Dr Nicolae said. The condition results in extra blood flow to the lungs, forcing the heart and lungs to work harder than usual. As a 19-month-old baby, Ms Borodin had surgery to place a band around her pulmonary artery, diminishing the blood flow to her lungs. ""The band is still there and, unfortunately, she's outgrown the band,"" Dr Nicolae said. ""That band has become so tight now that it's causing severe narrowing of the pulmonary artery."" At the same time, her heart has enlarged and she experiences frequent abnormal heart rhythms. ""She's breathless all the time. Her lung function is very poor,"" Dr Nicolae said. ""We are left with only the hope that she can have a heart and lung transplant."" Not all patients are deemed suitable for a transplant, but after rigorous assessments at the Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane — home of Queensland's only heart-lung transplant centre — Dr Nicolae is hopeful Ms Borodin will be placed on the waiting list for donor organs some time this year. Because of her petite size and her O-negative blood type — only found in about 9 per cent of the population — she may have to wait up to two years for a suitable match. ""Hopefully, we'll be able to get her through this next two years until she gets her transplant,"" Dr Nicolae said. But there are no guarantees. Earlier this year, Ms Borodin was admitted to the Mater Private Hospital's intensive care unit, with her heart specialist admitting he feared for her life. ""A couple of times were dicey times — she was very, very sick,"" Dr Nicolae said. Until she receives the call that matching donor organs have been found, Ms Borodin has a lot to live for. Her older sister, Rebecca, is due to give birth in August and she is excited to meet her niece or nephew. She has tickets to a Yungblud concert in July and is hopeful of catching up with the British singer again after meeting him when he was last in Brisbane in 2019. ""I've been to a lot of concerts and any time one of my favourite artists is coming, I'm always like: 'I'm going to buy tickets. I could be dead tomorrow',"" she said. ""I just live my life as if there's no tomorrow. Just make the most of every single moment. I think in some ways, it's the best way to live and go about things."" Long-term, the part-time worker at a Brisbane law firm hopes to finish her law degree. She is also passionate about fighting for the rights of people with invisible disabilities after being verbally abused herself when parking in disabled car spaces. ""I have a disability pass and I genuinely have disabilities,"" she said. ""I will park in a disabled spot … and just get verbally assaulted. ""People will be like, 'You're not even disabled, you can't park there.' I'll try to explain things to them and I just get scoffed at. ""That's really difficult and I feel like there's a lot of ignorance around it. ""I'm kind of, I guess, wanting to talk about it a bit more because I feel like I have nothing to lose now."" Her message to people when they see someone who is not in a wheelchair using a disabled car space or a disabled toilet is: ""Don't assume."" ""Only 4.4 per cent of people with a disability are actually in a wheelchair,"" she said. ""It really frustrates me when I hear the type of discrimination thrown around to people who don't look sick or disabled."" As a teenager who was bullied at school, Ms Borodin tried to conceal her illness behind makeup, using lipstick and nail polish to mask the deep blue of her lips and blue finger nails caused by much-lower-than-normal oxygen levels in her blood. These days, she only occasionally wears lipstick, no longer wishing to cover up evidence of her heart disease. But people will often compliment her on the colour of her lips, without realising it's a sign of ill health. ""People are like, 'I love your lipstick, which one are you wearing?'"" she said. ""I'm like, 'It's natural. I'm sorry I can't give you an exact colour.'"" Ms Borodin is one of about 650 people cared for by the Mater's Congenital Cardiology Service. The number is growing as more children with heart defects survive into adulthood. Dr Nicolae described young adults with cardiac defects as a ""forgotten"" group, with the focus usually on much older heart-attack patients. ""There are at least 60-70,000 adult congenital heart disease patients in Australia and they require long-term care and follow-up with specialist cardiologists, nurses, psychologists and surgeons,"" he said. Mater cardiology clinical nurse consultant Wendy Senior said young people with congenital heart problems faced issues most others their age would never have to confront, such as whether they would ever have children. ""That's a very tricky thing to navigate sometimes for them,"" Ms Senior said. ""They expect that we will be able to assist them and keep them safe and keep their babies safe. ""I'm sure that question comes up for Ksenia as well. It's probably not feasible at the moment, but looking into the future, we would love to be able to support her if that's what she wants."" For now, Dr Nicolae has ruled that out. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""She's been asking me repeatedly if she can have kids,"" he said. ""I've said, 'No, it's going to be exceedingly high risk for you.' ""Obviously, that's distressing to tell that to a young girl but, with a heart and lung transplant, potentially, that's a possibility."" Whatever happens moving forward, even the chance of having a heart-lung transplant has given Ms Borodin a priceless gift. ""At least now there's a little bit of hope,"" Ms Borodin said.

92,What's happening in our brains when we meditate? It's not just a question for neuroscience,science,"  What's happening in our brains when we meditate? It's not just a question for neuroscience Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Whether it's prayer, meditation, tai chi, or just chanting, every major religion weaves some form of contemplative practice into its rituals. You don't even have be religious to enjoy the widely acknowledged benefits of contemplation. Meditation is commonplace in the secular world too, as a way to develop insight and transformation by stilling the mind. But what's really going on in our mind when we meditate? And what about when our mind ""wanders"" or when we're suffering from delusion? Could these conscious states have benefits too? The ABC's Religion & Ethics portal is home to reporting on religion, ethical discussion and inspiring stories of faith and belief. These are the kinds of inquiry that Jakob Hohwy is keen to explore at Melbourne's new Centre for Consciousness and Contemplation. He's a professor in the department of philosophy at Monash University, where the centre is based, and the author of The Predictive Mind. Funded by philanthropy, the centre brings together a team of neuroscientists, philosophers, educators, and practitioners to address questions about the nature of consciousness, and how our conscious states change when we engage in contemplative practices like meditation. ""It's a huge investment in this area,"" Dr Hohwy says. ""I think it's bigger than anything else that we've seen so far, at Monash certainly, but also in Australia, as an investment into humanities-oriented research and education."" Philosophers and scientists have grappled for decades trying to decipher exactly what consciousness is. And while many other things have been discovered along the way, we still have no concrete answers about the nature of consciousness — which is why it's become known as the Hard Problem. ""It's the most important thing and it's the most familiar intimate thing. It's so intimate, in fact that it's hard to explain to others sometimes what our conscious state is. ""You have a neuroscientific theory of consciousness, there are a few of those around, and they're quite impressive theories. But they always have this explanatory gap built into them. ""That's why philosophy still has a role to play in trying to figure out what is going on in this domain of inquiry."" But as Dr Hohwy told David Rutledge in a recent episode of The Philosopher's Zone on ABC RN, the centre is not trying to solve the mystery of consciousness. Rather, he says, moving beyond this ""Hard Problem"" opens up some even more interesting questions to ask. ""How are we consciously aware of ourselves? How can we consciously engage in an active way with ourselves and change ourselves? How does consciousness connect to action?"" he asks. ""I think we can answer some of these questions without knowing the ultimate nature of consciousness."" Dr Hohwy says there's value in studying the underlying cognitive processes at play, so we can work with our consciousness to shift our thinking. ""Whenever we have a change in our conscious states, or some kind of transformative experience, whether grief, or through meditation, or taking psychedelics … something must be happening in the brain. ""You can't have a change in your consciousness without at the same time something changing in the brain, in the cognitive processing of information and beliefs that you have."" It's those changes that Dr Hohwy is hopeful can be described by scientific methods and revealed through analysis of experience. While the centre aims to broaden our knowledge of different contemplative practices and mental states, Dr Hohwy is keen to avoid categorising them in a hierarchical way. In psychology and psychiatry, for instance, some conscious states are viewed as normal while others (such as schizophrenia or psychosis) are considered abnormal, and Dr Hohwy wonders if that's counterproductive. ""There's research on psychosis and in particular delusion, where they're looking at whether delusions might have a positive effect on your defence mechanism,"" he says. ""This is not to underplay the hardship of people living with schizophrenia or other kinds of mental illnesses. But the way we stratify conscious states into good and bad … maybe it's time to reconsider some of these things."" Even the way meditation is pitched to us indicates the value we place on some mental states above others. Meditation, we're told, will train our minds to stop wandering so that we focus on what's important. But who's to say that mind wandering is bad in the first place? ""At the moment, people are beginning to say, well, mind wandering might actually not be such a bad thing,"" Dr Hohwy says. ""Maybe there's a reason we mind wander. ""Maybe it's good for us that we mind wander. What are the underlying cognitive processes? What are the health benefits of mind wandering?"" Wisdom is another area of research which Dr Hohwy is keen for the centre to explore. One school of thought might say only the wise — typically men — have wisdom, and it's not something the rest of us can aspire to. ""But once we think of wisdom as a cognitive, psychological construct with deep philosophical roots, we can open it up and make it a bit more accessible,"" Dr Hohwy says. A weekly digest of the best opinion, analysis and reporting on religion and ethics from ABC Radio National. To do that the centre has brought together a diverse team of secular and multi-faith experts from a range of disciplines. ""Cultures across the world and across history have found that there's something special happening when we do some kind of contemplative practice like meditation."" ""But it can't stand alone. It has to be plugged into a theoretical ethical framework that allows you to make sense of what happens when you meditate."" Understanding the changes taking place in the brain will hopefully allow us to integrate them into our daily lives, making us better people, creating a better world. ""I hope the centre will be able to open up some of these discussions without going down some ideological route.""

93,Uranus was nearly called George. And you've been saying it wrong,science," Science Uranus is a very weird planet. Here's why astronomers want to send a probe to it Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Of all our planets, Uranus has had a tough time in the reputation stakes over the years. Its name alone is the butt of jokes, and NASA's announcement last week that it wanted to target Uranus with a probe was a comedian's field day. But planetary scientists are over the moon our seventh planet is finally going to get its day in the sun. The fact that it's so far away from the Sun – 2.9 billion kilometres – is one of the reasons it has been so lonely and misunderstood. Unlike its flashy siblings Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus has only had one visitor — a brief flyby by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986, said Amy Simon, one of the NASA scientists who has been advocating for a mission to the planet. ""It's one of the strangest planets in the Solar System and yet we haven't been back there,"" Dr Simon says. ""So the time is right for us now to really go explore the whole system. ""This really is huge, unexplored territory."" Helen Maynard-Casely, an Australian planetary scientist at ANSTO who studies ice giant planets, agrees. ""It's just a shame that Uranus and Neptune have been ignored so much,"" Dr Maynard-Casely says. ""As soon as we start studying one of the two, it will reveal so much about the other one."" So let's see what makes this planet so cool (apart from the fact that at a very chilly minus-224 degrees Celsius, it holds the record for the coldest place in the Solar System). All the inner planets have been known since ancient times because they are easy to spot in the night sky, but Uranus was the first planet to be ""discovered"", and even then astronomers thought it was a comet or a star. If William Herschel had his way in 1781, our seventh planet would have been called Georgian Sidus, or George's Star, after his patron King George III. Seventy years later astronomers settled on Uranus. While many people pronounce the planet as Ur-Anus, astronomers prefer to say Uran-us. ""I think there are many ways of pronouncing it but if you go for Ur-Anus, people snigger,"" says Jonti Horner, a planetary scientist at the University of Southern Queensland. ""It would have been a lot easier if Herschel had his way and it was called George."" But Uranus is much more regal. It was named after the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos, father of Saturn and grandfather of Jupiter. Unlike all the other planets, Uranus is tipped on its side at an angle of 97.77 degrees. ""What that means is that it rolls along its orbit rather than spinning,"" Professor Horner says. ""It's a really very weird, very different place."" Its extreme tilt means that each pole continuously faces towards the Sun for 42 Earth years. ""Averaged through the course of the year, the poles get more sunlight and more energy than the equator, which is very different to other planets,"" Professor Horner says. We don't know why the planet — and its bevy of moons and rings that circle the equator — are on an angle. One hypothesis, says Dr Simon, is that it was smashed into by something roughly the same size in the early Solar System. But that doesn't explain how Uranus got its moons. ""It has all these small moons that are clearly in that same orbit and they had to have formed around the same time [as the planet],"" Dr Simon says. This sets it apart from its ice giant neighbour, Neptune. ""If you go to Neptune, its moons are not actually its original moons, they were captured."" Thanks to the planet's extreme tilt, it has extreme weather. Not that you'd realise that by looking at the images captured by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. ""It was just bland, blue, pretty, but nothing spectacular,"" Dr Simon says. Part of that was actually a consequence of Voyager's cameras. ""They were not that advanced and they could not see red wavelengths,"" she says. We also only got to see the planet's southern hemisphere during its summer. ""When Voyager flew by, one side was illuminated, we couldn't see the other side at all,"" she says. If other planets such as Jupiter or Neptune are any indication, weather patterns are more pronounced at the equator, Professor Horner says. ""So when Voyager flew past Uranus, it was maybe when the weather was least interesting,"" he says. In the 36 years since Voyager, we have glimpsed some of this weather through the lenses of the Keck Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. These telescopes have revealed massive storms caused when regions that haven't been heated for 42 years warm up as the seasons change. Supplied: NASA, ESA, A. Simon (Goddard Space Flight Center), and M.H. Wong (University of California, Berkeley) and the OPAL team But all our existing telescopes, including the new James Webb Space telescope, are still limited in what they can tell us, Dr Simon says. ""These planets are still very far away, so we can see details [with a space telescope] clearly better than we could with a small telescope on Earth, but it's still not as good as getting there."" Around four times the size of Earth, we think Uranus is a giant ball of dense fluid of ""icy"" materials – water, methane and ammonia — around a small rocky core. Its atmosphere is hydrogen and helium mixed with significant amounts of ammonia and methane, which gives it its blue colour, as well as water and other gasses. But we don't know exactly what these layers look like, Dr Maynard-Casely says. Understanding more about this could help us work out why the planet is so cold. ""It is colder than Neptune, we know that it's putting out less heat than we expect,"" Dr Maynard-Casely says. ""Is there a layer within the interior that's stopping the heat from escaping it?"" What's going on in the layers could also help explain why the planet has a very strange magnetic field. ""Its magnetic field doesn't seem to originate right in the centre like the Earth and magnetic fields of most other planets,"" Dr Maynard-Casely says. ""It looks like the magnetic field is coming from this from the mantle, the bit around the core."" One hypothesis, she says, is that the water and ammonia in the layers is under high pressure, which is changing the subatomic particles within them. ""Putting a spacecraft into orbit would enable us to find a lot more about how the density changes through the planet,"" she says. ""It gives you a lot better idea if there are three layers … and then those transitions between them. ""Or are there lots and lots of layers? Or is it sort of just a gradual change all the way down to the middle?"" Unlike other planets, whose moons are named after characters from Greek mythology, Uranus's 27 moons are named after the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. And like Uranus, Voyager only gave us fleeting glances of parts of these small worlds, which have names like Ophelia, Cordelia, Bianca and Belinda. ""Because Uranus is tilted on its side, it automatically comes in on an almost polar orbit, which is not great for getting to all those satellites that are in orbit at the equator,"" Dr Simon says. Yet we suspect some of them may be — or may have been — water worlds. ""It's incredible to think that something so far from the Sun can potentially have a habitable environment,"" Dr Simon says. ""It just kind of blows your mind."" Miranda — the fifth-largest moon named after the character in The Tempest — is covered with cracks and fissures. ""For a long time, Miranda was thought to be an object that was shattered and reconstructed from big lumps, but more recently people are thinking it's evidence of cryovolcanism,"" Professor Horner says. ""But to learn more about it, we need to get up there and spend time."" Miranda is odd, Dr Maynard-Casely agrees. ""It's the smaller of the round satellites, but it's got some really quite dramatic features. ""Are they something that's bumped into it, or are they actually about tectonic activity? ""It could also be that there's actually radiation damage on the surface."" Radiation damage from the Sun, Uranus itself, or from somewhere outside our Solar System, has the potential to change the structure of water into a glassy state known as amorphous ice. ""Because none of these moons have atmospheres, we do anticipate that there will be quite a lot of this amorphous ice on the surface,"" she says. It will take a while before Uranus is restored to its position as the ""God of the Sky"" (until then expect a couple more decades of jokes). Because Uranus is so far away and takes 84 years to orbit our Sun, it is very tricky to get to. ""It's really the mission for the next generation of scientists because it is on such a long timescale,"" Dr Simon says. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. If NASA can meet its 2031 or 2032 deadline, it will take 12 years for the mission to reach its destination using the gravitational pull of Jupiter to fling it out into the outer Solar System, Dr Simon says. ""It starts to get harder after that [deadline]. Then you can't use Jupiter and have to do Earth and Venus flybys,"" she says. Not only will NASA send an orbiter to spend time flying around the planet and its moon, it will plunge a probe through the planet's atmosphere. Equipped with modern technology, the mission will open our eyes, just like the Galileo mission did for Jupiter and Cassini did for Saturn. ""If we think about what we knew about Jupiter and Saturn from the Voyager spacecraft, and then compare that with what we know from Galileo and Cassini, we've learnt a huge amount more,""  Professor Horner says. ""It's the difference between having a single short flyby, and having months or years of continual observations."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

94,"Processionary caterpillars can make you itch, but are a 'sacred' link to the winter mullet season",science,"  Processionary caterpillar a welcome sign ahead of annual mullet season Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog While out on a bike ride with her family, Sunshine Coast mum Lisa Sowerby started spotting ""furry looking things"" shimmying across the concrete. ""I've never seen anything like it,"" Ms Sowerby says. ""I didn't realise caterpillars could be so big … I'm from the UK and our caterpillars are tiny compared to those."" Armies of processionary caterpillars are out in force, causing a flurry of excitement on social media. ""I've never seen them in Buderim before this season, but soooo many processions spotted in the last month or so. Quite prehistoric looking."" — Sarah Roberts ""Have been lots of them at Currimundi Lake"" — Annie Boyd The caterpillars have even featured in a season two episode of the children's show Bluey when writer and creator Joe Brumm needed an obstacle over a walkway and opted for ""something Australians are familiar with"". Processionary caterpillars, or itchy grubs, are dangerous to touch and can be harmful to other animals, but to First Nations people they are ""sacred"" and are a sign of the annual winter mullet season ahead. Josh Walker, a Nunagal man of the Quandamooka people, says after a few years of declining numbers, the caterpillars have ""bounced back"". ""I think it would be attributed to all of the good rains that we've had."" Mr Walker, from Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island), says the first indication of the fishing season came in March when parrots flocked to the islands to feed on pollinating flowers. The more parrots, the more mullet are expected. Then from April, caterpillars were seen marching in their signature nose-to-tail procession from underneath the wattle tree. ""When they start to move in their long lines, that's an indication to all of our people here in Moreton Bay that all of the mullet fish are making their way out of the streams and rivers south of here in New South Wales,"" Mr Walker says. He says the mullet move north to Queensland for the purpose of spawning and usually arrive throughout May and June, but hunting does not commence until First Nations people observe a third sign — the white-bellied sea eagle. ""On the day when the mullet fish arrive the eagle spots them, flies down low to the ocean water and head directly east to where the mullet fish are,"" Mr Walker says. ""That very sign of the flight of the eagle clearly tells our elders that on that day the mullet fish have arrived. ""We never hunt the mullet fish until after the eagle begins hunting because the eagle has learned that if you hunt the leading shoals of mullet fish, you scare them out to deep water and you miss out on the mullet fish season."" He says processionary caterpillars are crucial to the interconnectedness of the mullet fish season, which is ""our major economy of the bay"" and not seeing the hairy insects would cause ""great concern and extreme anxiety"". The processionary caterpillars marching across south-east Queensland at the moment are the larvae from female moths laid about five months ago, according to Queensland Museum's Chris Burwell. ""The female moth lays a big batch of eggs, the caterpillars hatch out and they all live together in a bag at the base of the tree,"" Dr Burwell, a senior curator of insects, says. ""We call them gregarious, and they all leave the plant together. ""At this time of year, they've finished growing and they are ready to leave the plant that they've been feeding on and find a suitable place to burrow into the ground to spend the cold winter months underground."" Dr Burwell says they can travel up to 200 metres in a nose-to-tail line from the host tree in search of a suitable place to burrow. Winning the war against hairy caterpillars threatening the horse industry comes down to two weapons: management and vigilance. Once underground, the caterpillars remain dormant during winter. ""As it starts to warm up probably around October, November, they'll pupate, so they'll turn into a chrysalis under the ground and then sometime later, the adult moths will come out and start flying around November,"" he says. The processionary caterpillar is one type of hairy caterpillar that are dangerous to humans and livestock, causing painful and itchy dermatitis and even premature foals being born. Dr Burwell says even the moth should be avoided. ""The females have an enormous kind of tuft of white scales on the end of their abdomen … and she lays a whole batch of eggs and then those scales are deciduous, they slough off the end of her abdomen and she uses it to coat the eggs to give it a bit of physical protection from parasites and the weather.

95,Tiny snail thought to be extinct found accidentally using tip shop roof tiles,science,"  Tiny snail thought to be extict found accidentally in Tasmania's yingina/Great Lake Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A tiny snail thought to be extinct has been found by accident in Tasmania's yingina/Great Lake, after not being seen since the 1900s. The Beddomeia tumida, a freshwater snail measuring around 4mm, was found as part of conservation monitoring of the lake by Entura, an arm of Hydro Tasmania. The chance discovery in the Central Plateau lake was the first time the snail had been seen or recorded for more than 120 years. Andy Taylor, an environmental scientist with Hydro Tasmania, said the snail was found by accident while the team was searching for another thought-to-be extinct species — the Great Lake giant freshwater limpet. ""It's been in the dark for quite some time now,"" he told Helen Shield on ABC Radio Hobart. ""There's very little known about the ecosystem [at Great Lake]. It's a fascinating and under-studied one. ""We'd really like to learn more about the snail and try and get a feel for its abundance."" The snail was listed as ""critically endangered but possibly extinct"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List and is only found at yingina/Great Lake. The limpet the team was searching for was discovered during a survey when the lake was at a historic low in 2015 and 2016, and researchers returned and found it again last year while the lake was full. Late last year, they sourced old roof tiles from the tip shop along with ropes and buoys to drop into the lake between 2 and 10 metres to see if any limpets or other bottom-dwelling creatures would latch on and call the tiles home. Within 10 days they not only found the limpet, but the elusive snail as well. Entura water quality consultant Kevin Macfarlane led the survey and said so far 15 snails had been found. ""Once we get an idea of the population size it could potentially be listed as not critically endangered, and hopefully we find that it's abundant,"" he said. ""As Beddomeia species are not present at locations of reduced water quality. This tells us that the water quality is very good, and the habitat is very good. ""It's not common for people in the sciences to discover new or extinct species, so it’s a great position to be in."" At first, Mr Macfarlane did not know what species the snail was when he pulled it up and had it formally identified by zoologist Dr Karen Richards from the environment department. When he got the text to say it was the missing species, he said it was ""really exciting"". ""I was extremely happy,"" he said. Mr Macfarlane said he had been trying to find the snail for nine years. ""We had hoped it was there and put effort into searching for it but couldn't find it,"" he said. He said in the 1990s mollusc experts spent a lot of time trying to find the snail but were unsuccessful. ""For us to incidentally find it is a fantastic find,"" he said. Great Lake is the second-largest natural lake in Australia and has been altered to a size of 176 square kilometres. Mr Macfarlane put down 100 tiles on ropes throughout the lake, but finding anything was a needle in a haystack mission. ""The chances of one of these crawling onto it is minuscule,"" he said. Given the record low levels in 2015–16, Mr Macfarlane said the lake's inhabitants must be very resilient. Surveys have also discovered other undescribed snail species, sponges, an aquatic plant, and a herb that resembles clover that had not been seen for 20 years. ""Great Lake has got so many endemic species,"" he said. The lake was the first source of water for Hydro Tasmania and was dammed in 1901, which made its levels rise. It initially fed Waddamana Power Station, which was run by the state-owned Hydroelectric Department from 1916 until 1964, and was replaced by Poatina Power Station in 1966.

96,Bite from deadly brown snake triggers seven-hour rescue from Karijini's Knox Gorge,science,"  Port Hedland mother rescued from Karijini's Knox Gorge after bite from deadly brown snake Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Megan Brouwer went hiking with her husband and five-year-old son in Karijini National Park she was concerned about spraining her ankle — instead she was bitten by a deadly snake. The family had begun their return hike in Karijini's picturesque Knox Gorge when Ms Brouwer's husband yelled ""snake"". ""I just knew in the way that he yelled it that it was either on me or very close to me,"" she said. ""So I jumped around frantically for a moment then saw it in the corner of my eye, slithering away. ""It was about a metre long brown snake, which I've since learned was a gwardar brown snake."" The gwardar, or western brown snake, is among the most venomous snakes in Australia. Ms Brouwer said she, her husband, and an off-duty doctor who was walking in the gorge at the time last Sunday, checked her legs and found fresh blood and a puncture wound. ""[The off-duty doctor] had a pressure bandage and applied that for me. She also had a satellite phone in hand … but unfortunately it wasn't connecting, we were so far in the gorge. ""So she then ran to the top of the gorge — which took her about an hour or so."" It took Karijini rangers, local police, State Emergency Service, and St John Ambulance volunteers, as well as passers-by helping the rescue effort seven hours to bring Ms Brouwer and her family to safety at the nearest hospital in Tom Price. She was then flown by Royal Flying Doctor Service to Port Hedland. ""It was like something I'd never experienced before,"" she said. ""It was quite surreal being floated through the water holes, being carried and hearing the commands they say to one another in their procedures."" Knox Gorge is a two-kilometre class-5 hike, and Ms Brouwer said it was ""pretty hairy"" in parts. ""The path itself got quite narrow at the edge of the cliff, and manoeuvring a stretcher around trees and up the cliff face was pretty scary for me,"" she said. ""There were also some unexpected things like wasps nests and lots of loose rock so footing was really, really important."" Fortunately for Megan Brouwer and her family, she had received a ""dry bite"" so was not envenomated by the attack. ""I was also thankful to the snake for giving me a dry bite,"" she said. ""I've since learned that if he had've got me a second time maybe that would've been a poisonous bite. ""But I'm all good. I know a lot more about snakes and I know how best to be prepared when you're hiking in very remote parts."" Ms Brouwer recommends hikers always have a first-aid kit on hand in their hiking pack, including a pressure bandage for snake bites, and said they should keep their first-aid training up to date. She said was incredibly grateful to emergency service volunteers, as well as to members of the public who helped by supplying bandages and trying to keep Ms Brouwer calm. The Brouwer family are hoping to return to Karijini in the future, but Megan Brouwer said she was not sure if she would be able to return to the scene of the snake bite. ""It might bring back a bit too many emotions of the day. But it was a very, very beautiful gorge,"" she said.

97,Australia joins dozens of countries committing to a 'democratic' internet,science,"  Australia joins dozens of countries committing to a 'democratic' internet Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Australia is among 56 nations signing a political commitment to push for the future of the internet to be underpinned by democratic values, in the face of hostile internet policies from countries such as China and Russia. The commitment — the first such effort of its kind, and known as the Declaration for the Future of the Internet — aims to protect human rights, promote the free flow of information, protect the privacy of users and set rules for a growing global digital economy. Other countries taking part include Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States and Ukraine. Australia's ambassador for cyber affairs and critical technology, Tobias Feakin, told the official launch of the declaration that Australia was ""genuinely proud"" to be part of the declaration. ""We really must ensure that cyberspace reflects and is strengthened by human rights and liberal democratic values,"" Dr Feakin said. ""It really needs to be resilient to those who would use digital technologies to undermine those rights and subvert those values. ""Over the last two decades, however, we have witnessed significant challenges to these values, and that is ongoing. ""Some are using, quite clearly, the internet to deny others human rights, conduct or condone malicious cyber activity, spread disinformation and harmful content, and abuse the openness of internet governance to advance a closed and authoritarian vision."" Dr Feakin said Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its ""blatant abuse"" of cyberspace was a reminder that other nations must work together. ""We must come together through initiatives like this, united by a shared belief and the potential future of an internet that enables digital technologies to promote connectivity, sustainable development and the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms,"" he said. ""We can achieve this by creating deeper trust in the global digital ecosystem — something states cannot do alone."" Since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has launched cyber attacks, including hacking into a satellite internet provider's network at the beginning of the war. Senior US officials said the United States was witnessing a global trend of rising digital authoritarianism, with countries such as Russia repressing freedom of expression, censoring independent news sites, interfering with elections, promoting disinformation and denying their citizens other human rights. From the plethora of claims made by politicians about the other side's record on the economy, climate and public services, to an influx of imported narratives about the electoral process, there's a lot of incorrect and misleading information circulating less than a week into the election campaign. So, what should you be on the lookout for? ""Look at what … Russia is doing, some of the steps China is taking, and I think we see this as a response to these kind of 'splinternet' tendencies by a number of authoritarian countries around the world,"" one official said, referring to a characterisation of the internet as splintering and dividing due to various factors, including politics. Ukraine's Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, said his country had witnessed misuse of the internet firsthand. ""We can see how Russian propaganda on a new technological level, including using the internet, is transforming people into zombies that are ready to kill, ready to rape children, ready to destroy whole cities,"" he said. ""We are living in a strange time; one part of the world is on the way of outstanding technological progress, democracy and sustainable development, while another part of the world is trying to use modern technologies for this genocide."" US officials said the Declaration for the Future of the Internet was not an attempt to address cyberwarfare. The declaration is a modified version of the White House's efforts from last year to rally a coalition of democracies around a vision for an open and free web. ""We face every day a rising tide of disinformation that sows division and conflict and hate around the world,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.

98,Study predicts mass marine-life extinction if warming continues,science,"  Ecophysiological modelling predicts mass marine-life extinction by the year 2300 if global warming continues Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog By the year 2300, life in the oceans faces a mass die-off rivalling the great extinctions of Earth's deep past if humanity fails to curb greenhouse gas emissions, according to a study in the journal Science. But limiting planetary warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will stave off such a catastrophe, said the paper's authors, Justin Penn and Curtis Deutsch, both affiliated with the University of Washington and Princeton University. The authors used ecophysiological modelling to weigh species' physical limits with projected marine temperatures and depletion of oxygen levels — a task that was particularly challenging given a lack of previous work in the area. The results were alarming: under ""business as usual"" warming, marine ecosystems planet-wide could experience a mass extinction comparable to that of the end-Permian extinction, known as the ""Great Dying."" This occurred 250 million years ago and led to the demise of more than two-thirds of marine animals, because of warming and oxygen depletion, similar conditions that are occurring today. While the tropical oceans would lose the most species, many from these areas would migrate to higher latitudes in order to survive. On the other hand, polar species would disappear en masse, since their types of habitat would disappear from the planet entirely. Limiting warming to 2C, the upper limit of goal set by the Paris agreement, ""would cut the severity of extinctions by  less than 70 per cent, avoiding a marine mass extinction,"" the paper said. Some of Australia's iconic and unique natural ecosystems are headed for irreversible damage if we keep emitting carbon at current rates, climate experts warn. But they're not necessarily the ones you might expect. The preferred goal, of limiting warming to 1.5C, is impossible to achieve with current international commitments, according to United Nations climate experts. ""Because marine extinctions have not progressed as far as those on land, society has time to turn the tide in favour of ocean life,"" wrote scientists Malin Pinsky and Alexa Fredston in an accompanying commentary. ""Exactly where the future falls between the best-case and worst-case scenarios will be determined by the choices that society makes not only about climate change, but also about habitat destruction, overfishing, and coastal pollution.""

99,NASA scientists spot Perseverance landing gear with Mars helicopter cameras,science,"  Mars helicopter beams back pictures of Perseverance landing gear en route to Jezero Crater Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A helicopter surveying Mars for NASA has beamed home an eerie image of the wreckage of the landing gear that protected the drone through its fiery descent towards the surface of the red planet. NASA's Ingenuity helicopter landed on Mars in February 2021 with the Perseverance rover for a combined land-and-sky surveillance mission. The unprecedented images show the parachute and cone-shaped backshell that protected the equipment as it made its high-speed impact on the surface of Mars. Looking at the upright backshell and debris that resulted from it impacting the surface at over 120kph, NASA scientists say the backshell's protective coating appears to have remained intact during the 20,000kph entry into Mars's atmosphere. Many of the suspension lines connecting the backshell to the parachute are visible and also appear intact. The parachute canopy shows no signs of damage from the supersonic airflow during inflation. Earlier, Perseverance had captured the parachute from a distance, but these close-up images are far more valuable to researchers, says Dr Ian Clark, a lead on the mission to preserve Perseverance's Martian sediment and rock samples for future return from Mars. ""Perseverance had the best-documented Mars landing in history, with cameras showing everything from parachute inflation to touchdown,"" he said. ""But Ingenuity's images offer a different vantage point. If they either reinforce that our systems worked as we think they worked or provide even one dataset of engineering information we can use for Mars Sample Return planning, it will be amazing. And if not, the pictures are still phenomenal and inspiring."" The Mars Sample Return is a multi-mission campaign that would bring Perseverance's samples of rocks, atmosphere and sediment back to Earth for detailed analysis. The Ingenuity is the first free-flying helicopter to operate on another planet and has been following dry river marks in the Jezero Crater of Mars. Several kilometres wide, the fan-shaped delta formed where an ancient river spilled into the lake that once filled Jezero Crater. Rising more than 40 metres above the crater floor and filled with jagged cliffs, angled surfaces, projecting boulders and sand-filled pockets, the delta promises to hold numerous geologic revelations — perhaps even proof that microscopic life existed on Mars billions of years ago, scientists hope. Upon reaching the delta, Ingenuity's first orders may be to help determine which of two dry river channels Perseverance should climb to reach the top of the delta. Along with route-planning assistance, data provided by the helicopter will help the Perseverance team pick out potentially rich sample beds for the rover to extract and return to Earth.

100,Wombat bald spots reduce as mange treatment shows promise,science,"  Wombats living with sarcoptic mange in Kangaroo Valley respond well to treatment Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As darkness descends, Scott Carver grabs his spotlight and goes in search of bald spots. Loss of hair caused by sarcoptic mange — introduced to Australia by animals belonging to European settlers — is a tell-tale sign of disease in wombats. ""We have records of it on wombats dating back 100 years, so it's been widespread in wombat populations for a long time,"" Dr Carver said. ""We're not at a stage where we can eradicate it from their populations, but we can manage it in some cases."" Mange is a skin infection caused by parasitic mites and has impacted several native species. It can result in aggressive scratching, weight loss and, in severe cases, death. Wombats are plentiful at Bendeela Recreation Area, north-west of Nowra, and have been under evaluation for two years. A treatment project there utilises a hands-off approach to animal welfare — it means finding and observing nocturnal creatures that start coming out of their burrows around 4pm each day. ""I basically walk the length of the campground, counting wombats and accessing how healthy they look,"" Dr Carver, a senior lecturer in wildlife ecology at the University of Tasmania, said. ""The good news is that at Bendeela most wombats are looking great, very healthy, with a small number showing signs of mange disease and I was able to treat them for that."" Using a scoring system to record the severity of each diseased animal, researchers like Dr Carver then deliver on-the-spot treatment similar to applying a tick serum on a pet. The treatments last between 30 and 90 days and their effectiveness depends on the severity of the disease in the wombat. Tony Webber from WaterNSW, which is working on the project with the universities of Sydney and Tasmania, said he hoped the treatment would be an effective cure for what was a distressing problem for the wombat population. Mangy wombats were now harder to spot, confirming field and study results, he said. ""It was actually less than our working estimate, probably less than 5 per cent of the population, which is less than a dozen animals of the 200 to 250 wombats that are actually at Bendeela,"" Mr Webber said. ""We're administering the treatment substance to individual animals without the need to capture them."" By minimising human interaction, the researchers reduce the stress on everybody, especially the wombat, plus they only target animals showing symptoms of mange. ""The community sees these animals, even if they are relatively small in number, suffering from this condition and it's quite distressing for them, so to have reached this stage is certainly very good news,"" Mr Webber said. ""If it's successful, there is less need to interact or interfere with the animals and the benefits will be much longer-lived.""

101,Choosing a dog breed for its temperament? This study says you're barking up the wrong tree,science," Science Breed stereotypes not good predictors of dog behaviour, gene study and owner survey suggest Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Every night, suburban parks fill with a mix of pooches of all shapes and sizes letting off some steam as their doting owners watch on. Parks have recently swelled with young dogs and first-time owners as pet ownership boomed through the pandemic. Some dogs are very social, others bark at strangers, some will fetch, others make their humans do all the work. While it might be tempting to attribute the behaviour of these canine companions to their breed, a new study published in the journal Science suggests breed is not a good predictor of an individual dog's behaviour. ""I feel like sometimes people think of the breeds as sort of like catalogue shopping,"" said study co-author Elinor Karlsson of the University of Massachusetts. ""You can go to those websites and they'll tell you, 'If you want a dog that's going to be friendly with your kids, you should get these breeds,'"" Professor Karlsson said. ""But you could get a dog from one of those breeds and it just happens to be a dog that doesn't like children. ""In any breed, you've got a pretty good chance of getting a dog that's not fitting to what the breed stereotype is."" According to the study, age or gender, rather than breed, were the best predictors of behaviour for some traits like activity level and playing with toys. But there were still some subtle differences, with some breeds more likely to display traits that harked to their ancestral roots. Dogs evolved from ancestral wolves thousands of years ago and were gradually selected for skills such as hunting, guarding or herding. The notion of breeds — selecting for physical and aesthetic traits such as colour, size and type of fur — only goes back around 160 years to the Victorian era. Modern breeds are ascribed qualities by organisations such as the American Kennel Club based on their ancestral functions as herders or hunters. Border collies, for example, are described as ""affectionate, smart and energetic"", whereas beagles are ""friendly, curious and merry"". To find out if these stereotypes had any genetic basis, the team surveyed the owners of more than 18,000 dogs who participated in a citizen science project called Darwin's Ark. The owners were asked a series of questions designed by dog trainers to tease out how their dogs stacked up in eight categories, such as their ability to follow directions, control their impulses, play with toys, socialise with humans or dogs, or how easily they were provoked by uncomfortable stimuli (""agonistic threshold""). ""People are very good at telling us about their dog's behaviour. They spend a lot of time watching their dog and if you ask them, they will tell you really accurately,"" Professor Karlsson said. The team cross-referenced this with DNA samples from 2,155 dogs. While around 600 of the dogs were purebreeds, most involved in the sample were mutts, said lead author Kathleen Morrill of the University of Massachusetts. ""Mutts are kind of like this magical natural experiment of just what happens when you throw different breeds and ancestries together,"" Ms Morrill said. The mutts also helped rule out biases about breed stereotypes from the owners, who were often unable to correctly identify the mix of breeds in their dog. But genetic testing can reveal what percentage of a breed a mutt carries. For instance, Jack (above) is one-quarter American pit bull terrier. The study found breed only explains 9 per cent of the behavioural variation in individual dogs. ""We basically showed that every behaviour was seen in every single breed,"" Professor Karlsson said. In saying that, though, there were some traits that were more likely to be passed down through the generations of some breeds of dogs. Border collies and mutts with a greater percentage of border collie were good at following directions, while beagles, bloodhounds and Siberian huskies were more likely to howl than other dogs. The team identified 11 points on the genome that were associated with behaviours such as howling and human sociability. Many of these so-called motor characteristics, such as howling, pointing, retrieving and playing with toys, are throwbacks to when dogs evolved from wolves. Although a number of breeds, such as American pit bull terriers, are banned or restricted in Australia, no breed in the study stood out as being aggressive. ""[Agonistic threshold] was actually the behavioural factor that we found almost no evidence of any breed differences for,"" Professor Karlsson said. Instead, these behaviours appeared to be influenced by environmental, not genetic, factors. ""You could be born with the best genetics in the world, but if you don't have the right experiences, for example, in early puppyhood, that could totally change your personality,"" she said. ""Genetics is not destiny in a way, in people or dogs."" The study included information about 78 companion dog breeds, but it did not go into the behavioural traits of working dogs. ""These dogs are currently being selected to do a job, people don't care what they look like,"" Professor Karlsson said. ""We would expect to see a lot more behavioural distinctiveness in those populations,"" she said. But there were very few iconic Australian working dogs like kelpies in the owner database, she added. When you're looking for a dog, Australian kelpie puppies can prove irresistible. Just make sure you know what's involved before you bring one home. It is very hard to study the genetics of behaviour, said Claire Wade, an animal genetics expert at the University of Sydney who studies purebred kelpies. ""We know that these complex traits are likely to be influenced by hundreds, if not thousands, of different genes,"" Professor Wade said. ""There's no question you get a lot of variation across breeds, but I think it comes from so many places affecting each trait that it's going to be hard to pin down something that's biologically meaningful."" There's a lot of nurture in there, as well as nature. ""How many of those behaviours are innate — just the way the dog is — versus trained behaviour?"" Professor Wade said. And perception of a dog's behaviour can depend upon circumstance, or where the dog is when it's being watched. Professor Wade said trying to tease out the answers to these questions would be even harder with mixed breeds. ""If you do have major genes that affect something, are they dominant or recessive, are they affected by environment, are they masked by genes contributed by the other breed? ""But if you throw large numbers at it [as they've done in the study], then you can find biological meaning at the end of it, but I don't think they are there yet [in our understanding of the genetics of behaviour]."" However, while the genetics of behaviour was ""still a mystery"", Professor Wade said the data collected in the study on how aging affected a dog's behaviour was very interesting. ""When they are young, they want to play with everybody, but that really drops off by the time they are four or five. Then they end up not wanting to play with anyone. ""We kind of know that, but yet we all drag our dog off to the dog park hoping it's going to get along with most dogs. ""And what that shows is in the case of most dogs, that's probably not the right thing to do."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

102,"From today, fruit pickers can't earn less than $25.41 an hour and you might see that price in your basket",science," ABC Rural Minimum pay requirements for farm workers take effect today and you might see that price in your basket Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Shoppers are being warned that cost-of-living pressures may get worse from today as pay changes on farms across the country have the potential to make fruit and vegetables more expensive. It is the first day of a new wage structure for workers in the horticulture industry, marking one of the most significant changes ever for Australian agriculture. Under the new rules, workers picking or packing produce by piece rate — that is, getting paid by how much they harvest — now have a guaranteed minimum rate of pay. It follows the ruling by the Fair Work Commission late last year, which many farm groups rallied against, saying it would dis-incentivise productive workers. Chief executive of Fruit Growers Tasmania, Peter Cornish, said while a minimum pay guarantee was ""a good thing"" and much work had been done in the lead up to the new system to ensure farms complied, it was ""likely"" to increase produce prices at the supermarket. ""There will be higher cost pressures. Whether that transfers into [sale] prices or not is another matter, but there will be a pressure on that for sure,"" he said. ""If they have to top up people that are below the minimum, that means higher costs and it may well transfer into higher fruit prices as well."" Growers will have to ensure all harvest workers under the Horticulture Award are paid at least $25.41 an hour, though they can earn more than that for increased productivity. The case was brought to the Commission by the Australian Workers Union (AWU) after years of successive headlines about farm workers being severely underpaid. The Commission's full bench ""expressed the view that the existing pieceworker provisions in the Horticulture Award are not fit for purpose"". AWU national secretary Daniel Walton said some growers were using piece rates to pay workers as little as $3 an hour. ""Underpayment was widespread. That's the evidence we put forward, and that's what the independent umpire found sufficient to rule to put in this pay floor,"" he said. ""The old piece rate structure was never meant to be a mechanism to rip workers off, it was meant to ensure workers could earn more. But that wasn't always happening."" Mr Walton said farmers could still incentivise workers to be more productive in a way that benefited everyone. ""What this also does is stop those unscrupulous, dodgy employers from the countless examples right across the country from paying workers well below the award,"" he said. Producers have had mixed responses to the change, but most agree it will fundamentally overhaul the way fruit and vegetables are produced and harvested, for better or worse. Laurie Adams is the general manager of Burlington Berries, a producer south of Launceston. He watched similar measures be implemented in the United Kingdom in 2012 and expects similar consequences. ""It'll be a more structured workplace, more suitable for the professional workers and unfortunately less viable for backpackers, students, semi-retired people who liked to come in a few days a week and were happy to earn some cash in hand,"" he said. ""That traditional backpacker picking fruit for the summer will become a thing of the past."" Mr Cornish agreed, saying 10-20 per cent of the Tasmanian workforce would not be able to stay employed ""because they won't be able to meet that minimum daily amount, so they'll be subsidised by the employers and the employers won't be able to afford that"". Traditional piecework rates pay workers according to the amount of produce they harvest or pack. Soon, farm workers picking fruit on a piece rate must be guaranteed a minimum hourly rate. In the same way the UK farms became more reliant on repeat seasonal workforces from Eastern Europe, Mr Adams expected Australian farms would need more workers from the federal government's Seasonal Worker Program, which mostly come from Pacific island nations. At his farm, opinions differed between two pickers. Hendra, who did not give his last name, moved to northern Tasmania from Indonesia two years ago and disagreed with the changes. ""If you've got a picker working hard and one not working hard and they get paid the same price, I think that's not fair,"" he said. Rio, who also did not give his last name, also moved to Tasmania to pick fruit. He arrived from Timor Leste three years ago and he said he was ""pleased to hear about the changes"" because it would attract more people to do seasonal work.

""I think if we keep doing a good job here then the company will get more people from Timor Leste and they'll do a good job too."" Mr Cornish hoped the new structure would be enforced better than the last set of rules. ""One of the issues we've had with this is the Fair Work Ombudsman needs to get out and ensure they're policing these new changes,"" he said. ""[Underpayment] is one of our bigger issues, and the public, workers, and growers can approach this now with confidence that that's addressed — as long as it's enforced."" Mr Adams said he had always seen the debate as less about wages and more about compliance. ""We'll operate under a new wage structure, we operated under the old wage structure. The real challenge is if the wider industry is going to be held compliant,"" the farm manager said. ""The problems in the past came not from a lack of a system, but from a lack of compliance. ""It's the businesses that weren't following the previous set of rules that really need to be challenged and forced to comply.""

103,Can your mobile phone get a virus? Yes – but you'll have to look carefully to see the signs,science,"  Can your mobile phone get a virus? Yes – but you'll have to look carefully to see the signs Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog With nearly 84 per cent of the world's population now owning a smartphone, and our dependence on them growing all the time, these devices have become an attractive avenue for scammers. Last year, cyber security company Kaspersky detected nearly 3.5 million malicious attacks on mobile phone users. The spam messages we get on our phones via text message or email will often contain links to viruses, which are a type of malicious software (malware). There's a decent chance that at some point you've installed malware that infected your phone and worked (without you noticing) in the background. According to a global report commissioned by private company Zimperium, more than one-fifth of mobile devices have encountered malware. And four in ten mobiles worldwide are vulnerable to cyber attacks. But how do you know if your phone has been targeted? And what can you do? Like personal computers, phones can be compromised by malware. For example, the Hummingbad virus infected 10 million Android devices within a few months of its creation in 2016, and put as many as 85 million devices at risk. Every day we're sent links by brands, politicians, friends and strangers. You download apps on your devices. Maybe you use QR codes. And any of these could be hiding something more sinister. Typically, a phone virus works the same way as a computer virus: a malicious code infects your device, replicates itself and spreads to other devices by auto-messaging others in your contact list or auto-forwarding itself as an email. A virus can limit your phone's functionality, send your personal information to hackers, send your contacts spam messages linking to malware, and even allow the virus's operator to ""spy"" on you by capturing your screen and keyboard inputs, and tracking your geographical location. In Australia, Scamwatch received 16,000 reports of the Flubot virus over just eight weeks in 2021. This virus sends text messages to Android and iPhone users with links to malware. Clicking on the links can lead to a malicious app being downloaded on your phone, giving scammers access to your personal information. Flubot scammers regularly change their target countries. According to cyber security firm Bitdefender, FluBot operators targeted Australia, Germany, Poland, Spain, Austria and other European countries between December 1 2021 and January 2 of this year. While Apple devices are generally considered more secure than Android, and less prone to virus attacks, iPhone users who ""jailbreak"" or modify their phone open themselves up to security vulnerabilities. Scammers would be ""bonkers"" not to take advantage of the pandemic, according to a cybersecurity expert, and that's exactly what they're trying to do. Here's what to look out for. Similarly, Android users who install apps from outside the Google Play store increase their risk of installing malware. It's recommended all phone users stay on guard, as both Apple and Android are vulnerable to security risks. That said, phones are generally better protected against viruses than personal computers. This is because software is usually installed through authorised app stores that vet each app (although some malicious apps can occasionally slip through the cracks). Also, in comparison to computers, phones are more secure as the apps are usually ""sandboxed"" in their own isolated environment – unable to access or interfere with other apps. This reduces the risk of infection or cross contamination from malware. However, no device is entirely immune. While it's not always easy to tell whether your phone is infected, it will exhibit some abnormal behaviours if it is. Some signs to watch out for include: If you do suspect a virus has infected your device, there are some steps you can take. First, to prevent further damage you'll need to remove the malware. Here are some simple troubleshooting steps: Now you've fixed your phone, it's important to safeguard it against future viruses and other security risks. The mobile security apps mentioned above will help with this. But you can also: Continually monitor your phone for suspicious activity and trust your gut instincts. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

104,"As saltwater crocodile numbers rise, so too could be their appetite for feral pig",science,"  NT saltwater crocodiles are more carnivorous than their ancestors, research suggests Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Scientists have uncovered evidence that suggests the diet of saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory has shifted away from marine prey towards land-based animals, including feral pigs. Researchers at Charles Darwin University compared bone samples from saltwater crocodiles killed around the 1960s, held at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, to those of contemporary saltwater crocodiles. ""We saw that crocodiles back then were primarily feeding on the estuaries, taking up fish, turtles, crabs,"" Dr Mariana Campbell, who co-authored the research, said. ""Now they are primarily feeding upon the terrestrial environment, taking up feral pigs, buffalo wallabies. ""We could see that the signature found on contemporary crocodiles, or crocodiles that we see around today, you can see that it's more that they have been eating upon what we call the terrestrial food web."" Dr Campbell said an increased number of feral pigs in freshwater floodplains, a reduction in estuarine prey, and more freedom to roam since the end of the crocodile-hunting era all could have contributed to why crocodile diets had changed. Fifty years ago, crocodiles had been shot almost to extinction in the Northern Territory. Now the apex predators again dominate the waterways. The diet shift coincides with the exponential increase in the Northern Territory's crocodile population in the past 50 years. A ban on hunting crocodiles in the Northern Territory was introduced in 1971, when it was estimated only 3,000 crocs were left in the wild. Thanks in large part to the protection of the species, it is estimated that the NT's saltwater crocodile population is now about 100,000. ""When they were protected, no-one was really quite sure whether they could really recover,"" Dr Grahame Webb, one of Australia's most prominent crocodile scientists, said. ""But they did recover, and the whole sort of system changed, and the rest is history."" Dr Campbell said the shift to a more land-based diet is not a behavioural change. ""It is simply to do with food availability, they are eating what they encounter,"" she said. The rapid change in the saltwater crocodile population, she said, was a success story. ""This is an incredible recovery, it's something extremely difficult to do, and it's something the Northern Territory can be proud of,"" she said. ""We helped recover a top predator population and live alongside it."" Dr Webb also welcomed the study. ""What I'm excited about is it just demonstrates the values of museums holding these big reference collections,"" he said. The research, he said, could lead to further studies into crocodile populations, including the prevalence of crocodile cannibalism as the population grew. ""As the crocs were recovering, crocs were eating other crocs,"" he said. ""Cannibalism has become a really big issue, and that could be implicated in these results.""

105,SpaceX Crew 4 launches for International Space Station,science,"  NASA's SpaceX Crew-4 mission launches to International Space Station Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog NASA's SpaceX Crew-4 mission has launched from the United States, bound for the International Space Station (ISS). If all goes according to plan, the three US astronauts and their European Space Agency (ESA) crewmate from Italy will reach the space station after a 17-hour flight. They will then begin a six-month science mission orbiting some 420 kilometres above Earth. The latest mission, designated Crew 4, marks the fourth time a fully fledged ISS crew NASA has been sent to orbit on board a SpaceX vehicle since the private rocket venture founded by Elon Musk began flying US space agency astronauts in 2020. SpaceX has launched six previous human spaceflights over the past two years. Crew 4's commander is Kjell Lindgren, 49, a board-certified emergency medicine physician and one-time flight surgeon who is making his second trip to the ISS, where he logged 141 days in orbit in 2015. During that expedition, he performed two spacewalks and participated in more than 100 science projects, including the ""veggie"" lettuce experiment that marked the first time a US crew member ate a crop grown in orbit. Another crew member making her debut spaceflight is mission specialist Jessica Watkins, 33. The geologist earned her doctorate studying the processes behind large landslides on Mars and Earth and went on to join the science team for the Mars rover Curiosity at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Dr Watkins will become the first African American woman to join a long-duration mission aboard the International Space Station. She follows in the footsteps of only seven other black astronauts to have boarded the ISS since its inception more than two decades ago. Rounding out Crew 4 is Samantha Cristoforetti, 45, an ESA astronaut and Italian air force jet pilot making her second flight to the space station. She is slated to assume command of ISS operations during the team's six-month stint, becoming Europe's first woman in that role. She and Dr Watkins previously served together as aquanauts in the Aquarius underwater habitat of the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) mission in 2019. The Crew 4 team will be welcomed aboard by seven existing ISS occupants, the four Crew 3 members they will be replacing — three American astronauts and a German ESA crewmate due to end their mission in early May — and three Russian cosmonauts. The launch came less than two days after a separate four-man team organised by Houston-based company Axiom Space returned from a two-week mission as the ISS's first all-private astronaut crew, splashing down on Monday in a different SpaceX capsule. It also follows a flurry of recent astro-tourism flights. Last July, two commercial space operators, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic, launched back-to-back suborbital flights with their respective billionaire founders, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, riding along.

106,Australian meteorite one of three with key building blocks for life's 'prebiotic soup',science,"  Australian meteorite one of three with key building blocks for life's 'prebiotic soup' Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A fresh examination of meteorites that landed in Australia, Canada and the United States is bolstering the notion that such objects may have delivered to Earth early in its history chemical ingredients vital for the advent of life. Scientists previously had detected on these meteorites three of the five chemical components needed to form DNA, the molecule that carries genetic instructions in living organisms, and RNA, the molecule crucial for controlling the actions of genes. Researchers said on Tuesday they had now identified the final two after fine-tuning the way they analysed the meteorites. Unlike in previous work, the methods used this time were more sensitive and did not use strong acids or hot liquid to extract the five components, known as nucleobases, according to astrochemist Yasuhiro Oba of Hokkaido University's Institute of Low Temperature Science in Japan, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications. Nucleobases are nitrogen-containing compounds crucial in forming DNA's characteristic double-helix structure. Confirmation of an extraterrestrial origin of a complete set of nucleobases found in DNA and RNA buttresses the theory that meteorites could have been an important source of organic compounds necessary for the emergence of Earth's first living organisms, according to astrobiologist and study co-author Danny Glavin of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Scientists have been seeking to better understand the events that unfolded on Earth that enabled various chemical compounds to come together in a warm watery setting to form a living microbe able to reproduce itself. The formation of DNA and RNA would be an important milestone as these molecules essentially contain the instructions to build and operate living organisms. ""There is still much to learn about the chemical steps that led to the origin of life on Earth — the first self-replicating system,"" Dr Glavin said. ""This research certainly adds to the list of chemical compounds that would have been present in the early Earth's prebiotic (existing before the emergence of life) soup."" The researchers examined material from three meteorites — one that fell in 1950 near the town of Murray in the US state of Kentucky, one that fell in 1969 near the town of Murchison in Victoria, Australia, and one that fell in 2000 near Tagish Lake in Canada's British Columbia province. All three are classified as carbonaceous chondrites, made of rocky material thought to have formed early in the solar system's history. They are carbon-rich, with the Murchison and Murray meteorites containing about 2 per cent organic carbon by weight and the Tagish Lake meteorite containing about 4 per cent organic carbon. Carbon is a primary constituent of organisms on Earth. ""All three meteorites contain a very complex mixture of organic molecules, most of which have not yet been identified,"" Dr Glavin said. Earth formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago. In its infancy, it was pelted by meteorites, comets and other material from space. The planet's first organisms were primitive microbes in the primordial seas, and the earliest-known fossils are marine microbial specimens dating to roughly 3.5 billion years ago, though there are hints of life in older fossils. The two nucleobases, called cytosine and thymine, newly identified in the meteorites might have eluded detection in previous examinations because they possessed a more delicate structure than the other three, the researchers said. The five nucleobases would not have been the only chemical compounds necessary for life. Among other things needed were amino acids, which are components of proteins and enzymes, sugars, which are part of the DNA and RNA backbone, and fatty acids, which are structural components of cell membranes. ""The present results may not directly elucidate the origin of life on the Earth,"" Dr Oba said, ""but I believe that they can improve our understanding of the inventory of organic molecules on the early Earth before the onset of life.""

107,Why Harvard's famous 'crocodile with flippers' fossil was dynamited from Queensland ground,science,"  Prehistoric crocodile fossil, Kronosaurus queenslandicus, lingers far from home at Harvard Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A world-famous specimen of a prehistoric marine reptile named after Queensland has sat at Harvard University in the United States for about 90 years. Outback Kronosaurus tourism founder Rob Ievers says the rare find should remain at Harvard because moving it could damage the fossil Central Queensland fossil education guide and enthusiast Phil Hore would like to see the world's only mounted Kronosaurus queenslandicus returned to the state. The species lived between 120 to 200 million years ago and belongs to an extinct group of reptiles known as plesiosaurs, with the last dying in a mass extinction event with dinosaurs. Mr Hore said he believed the Harvard fossil was ""one of the biggest ones ever found"". ""The closest thing would be maybe if you think of a crocodile with flippers, that is as big as a sperm whale and with the head the size of basically a small truck,"" he said. ""I've never understood why Queensland hasn't … tried to actually get it back from Harvard."" But Queensland Museum palaeontologist Espen Knutsen said the specimen was ""scientifically useless"" and it would be better for researchers to hunt for new specimens in western parts of the state. ""Harvard dug out a couple Kronosaurus specimens and took them back to Harvard in America and they sat there for a few decades before some amateur came along who was interested in seeing it restored,"" he said. ""They reconstructed a lot of things and added some bits here and there and pretty much coated most of the skeleton in plaster. ""Most palaeontologists call this specimen the 'plasterosaurus' because its such a reconstructed skeleton. ""I think it'd be more worthwhile to spend some more time and money and go out and find better specimens here."" In fact, Dr Knutsen said the Harvard reptile at almost 13 metres long is exaggerated in size thanks to its reconstruction. He said while it was difficult to estimate the size of the creature with only partial skeletons, some natural samples were about 10 metres long. The specimen now lies in Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The museum was contacted for comment but did not answer whether the university would consider returning the fossil. Director Gonzalo Giribet said the fossil was purchased from the McNamara family in Queensland. ""The MCZ has maintained a longstanding relationship with the descendants of the owner of the ranch who sold the specimen, several of whom have visited the MCZ even as recently as September 2017,"" Professor Giribet said. ""The MCZ made one cast of the fossil snout and donated it to the Queensland Museum in 1974."" Founder of Richmond's Kronosaurus Korner, Rob Ievers, has devoted the last 27 years of his life to the ancient marine reptile. Surprisingly, he does not believe Harvard's fossil should be returned to its homeland. ""To have that fossil returned to Richmond that would be very, very difficult. It's possible some damage could be done to it,"" Mr Ievers said. ""It was given in good faith at the time, nobody else wanted it, and they've done years and years of prep work [on the fossil] that comes at a great cost."" The fossil was found on a property called Army Downs, 40 kilometres north of Richmond in western Queensland, sometime just after World War I. The property owner was reportedly happy to donate the fossil to visiting American archaeologists. Mr Ievers said that the method it was extracted from the earth was very different to how fossils are handled today. ""It was actually dynamited out of the ground, believe it or not, and packed into big crates,"" he said. ""Then they packed wool in around the fossil, and then it was shipped overseas to the United States."" Despite its harsh treatment, Mr Ievers said the fossil was still extraordinarily rare. ""It's not everyday that you stumble across a fossil of Kronosaurus. You have to be extremely lucky,"" he said. The state government is asking Queenslanders to vote for their favourite fossil to add to the state's nine official emblems to recognise the importance of fossils to the tourism industry. The list of 12 dinosaurs, including the Kronosaurus and Muttaburrasaurus, was made after feedback from museums, tourism organisations, and councils. Mr Hore said he thought the Kronosaurus queenslandicus should win. ""It's in the name,"" he said. ABC Capricornia will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday.

108,Wedge-tailed eagles gather for vulture act in stunning photo,science,"  Bird watcher's Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle photo shows group's vulture-like behaviour Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An amateur photographer says he was in the right place at the right time when he captured nine wedge-tailed eagles in one shot. James Hanslow was birdwatching in Tasmania's Southern Midlands when he spotted a large group of the endangered raptors in a paddock. ""I've seen a family group of five before, but this was just a fluke,"" he said. ""I just thought, 'Wow, that's pretty awesome.' ""I was in the right place at the right time and the sun was setting to give it that orangey glow. I was stoked."" Mr Hanslow is a former sculptor and first started taking photos of eagles to get more realistic details of the birds for his art. His son bought him a digital SLR camera last year so he could upgrade from a camera phone and said spotting eagles was a hobby. ""They are pretty impressive,"" he said. ""I think they are a magnificent-looking bird and we are lucky to have them around."" According to the latest statistics from the Tasmanian government, the total adult population of wedge-tailed eagles in the state is estimated at less than 1,000. Wildlife biologist Nick Mooney said it was uncommon to see a large group of eagles gathering, but had spotted up to 16 birds at once while conducting surveys. He said eagle numbers were restoring in Tasmania and group sightings were becoming less rare. ""This is usually after breeding when the birds aren't strongly territorial,"" he said. Mr Mooney said the group was a mixture of immature eagles and adults. ""All the birds from a particular catchment will gather in the one place where there's a lot of food,"" he said. ""Australia doesn't have vultures, but the eagles will do partly the same job. ""It tells you they've got together for a reason, and it's always food."" Mr Mooney said the eagles would be gathering because there was dead and dying native wildlife in the area, as well as stock. He said wildlife could get toxoplasmosis and become weak, while stock could get perennial rye grass staggers during this time of year — a condition caused by eating a type of fungus. ""There's a lot of dead animals and sick animals, and that's very interesting to eagles,"" Mr Mooney said. Mr Mooney said when one eagle spotted a carcass or sick animal other tended to follow. ""If they are hunting they'll be more dispersed because they don't want competition,"" he said. ""When they gather they puff themselves up and strut around on the ground to intimidate their neighbour."" Mr Hanslow said there were sheep in the area where he took the photo and he had noticed wool on the ground. ""It does look like they were feeding on something,"" he said. Mr Mooney said the juvenile eagles liked to get in on the action and learn from the older birds. He said the gatherings occurred on a more grand scale on mainland Australia in groups of up to 40. ""I reckon it's fantastic,"" he said. The Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle is a different subspecies but looks very similar to its mainland cousins. Mr Mooney said white-bellied sea eagles also gathered in large groups when they were picking off fish and juvenile shearwaters, with sightings occurring in the north-west and at Port Davey. ""It's an impressive sight and something we're not used to,"" he said. Mr Mooney said the best spot to see multiple wedge-tailed eagles in Tasmania was at Lemont, east of Oatlands.

109,Has Elon Musk lost the plot in buying Twitter?,science,"  Now that he is buying Twitter, has Elon Musk finally lost the plot? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Elon Musk has never played by the rules. He became the world's richest man by making electric cars through a venture that, despite being unprofitable until 18 months ago, is somehow valued at more than $US1 trillion ($1.38t) — more than every other automobile manufacturer combined. His other great business ventures involve exploring space (with SpaceX) and digging tunnels beneath the earth (with The Boring Company). Neither of those turn a profit, just yet. But that hasn't deterred his legion of true believers. Part of the allure is that Musk is considered a visionary. He's combined that with an extraordinary talent for putting together a management, manufacturing and marketing structure to efficiently source material and produce high-end product with a sharp focus on the future. It's a combination that has allowed even the most blue-blood establishment figures to overlook some of his more outlandish and erratic behaviour. And there have been some doozies. Remember the time he sparked up a joint during a Joe Rogan podcast? Then there was his plunge into cryptocurrency, telling the world via Twitter that he would accept bitcoin for cars, and the sudden about face not long after. What about the time he suggested one of the Thai cave rescuers was a ""pedo""? He won the resulting defamation case but left many aghast. And who could forget his pledge to launch a takeover of Tesla three years ago, only to reverse course 17 days later? Mostly, Musk's sins have been considered an aberration or a sideshow, even when they've attracted the attention of America's corporate regulator. After all, he has a brilliant track record of success, given he was one of the brains behind PayPal. But this time, even his most ardent supporters have their doubts. His $61.1 billion takeover of Twitter has left many analysts stumped. While, like many of the billionaire's other ventures, it has never turned a profit, many fear that it never will; that its best days are behind it and that its business model is seriously flawed. No matter how you look at it, that is a lot of cash to fork out on a loss-making operation. Twitter has agreed to accept a $61 billion takeover bid from billionaire Elon Musk in a deal that's set to shake up the social media platform as we know it. Here's what it means for Twitter users and how it will change. True, Twitter only lost $307 million last year, a much-improved performance from the previous year's $1.58 billion dip into the red. But compared with its main social media rival Facebook, Twitter has been a dismal failure when it comes to harnessing advertising dollars and, worryingly, it appears Musk has little idea how to turn that around. If those difficulties already weren't enough of a hurdle, his Twitter plunge has coincided with a dramatic shift in the global economic landscape. After more than three decades of declining inflation and interest rates, global finance suddenly has been thrust into reverse with the prospect of a sharp rate hikes. It is a situation likely to imperil debt-laden corporations and especially those that do not earn a profit, or at least enough of a profit to cover their debts. Given it no longer will be listed on the stock exchange, Twitter's finances will be far more opaque and share price pressures will no longer exist. But Musk's bankers, who are forking out about $32 billion to cover his purchase, will be keeping a keen eye on proceedings. Musk has long had a love/hate relationship with Twitter. He is one of its most prolific and high-profile users, with about 83 million followers. He's used it, much to the annoyance of America's Securities and Exchange Commission, to announce many of his more controversial business moves. More recently, he has berated the company for attempting to muzzle free speech and particularly his own. And that's what is troubling both corporate America and the broader community. While moguls always have been attracted to media and the power it confers upon them, they've traditionally graduated to mainstream outlets. Think Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, whose company Nash Holdings owns The Washington Post. As the world's richest man with a penchant for the outrageous, Musk will become commander in chief of an outlet that has faced intense criticism for allowing misinformation on everything from politics to the pandemic to be freely distributed on its platform. Recently, Musk has been leading the charge to wind back some of Twitter's self-imposed restrictions, a shift many fear could see the platform once again thrust into the limelight as a tool for social division and political upheaval. He's a space rocket mogul, an electric car salesman, a madcap inventor, and a celebrity entrepreneur. Who is Elon Musk, and how did he become the richest person in the world? From a business perspective, such a possibility raises even more concerns. Advertisers, particularly those that fear controversy, could disembark, which would further undermine Twitter's financial performance. And then there is the time involved. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey only recently had to choose between the company and his new venture Block, as it was believed he couldn't devote the necessary energy to the social media site. For a man as obsessive as Musk, brilliant though he may be, there are concerns his personal involvement could well cloud his judgement and draw attention away from what should be his primary focuses — Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Company. Tesla made $7.6 billion last year after making $1 billion the previous year. It was enough to wipe out all the losses it had racked up since it was formed. ""Which I think makes us a real company at this point,"" Musk told investors on a conference call in late January this year. Musk has pledged to stump up $29 billion in cash for the Twitter purchase. The rest will come in debt from the likes of investment bank Morgan Stanley. To fund that, the Tesla boss will be forced to sell down some of the stock in his electric vehicle operation. He may be worth more than $367 billion, but his net worth is based almost entirely upon the sky-high valuation of Tesla. As we've seen in recent weeks, overvalued technology outfits such as Netflix — which plunged 38 per cent overnight last week — can suddenly unravel when things don't go exactly to plan.

110,Singapore and The Netherlands have turned to nature to minimise flood damage. Could it work here?,science," Science Nature-based solutions, and how countries like Singapore and The Netherlands are using them to fight floods Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Caroline Sullivan has both a personal and professional connection to the recent devastating floods in eastern Australia. She recently headed up a flood research centre based at Southern Cross University in Lismore, and has a house up the hill from the city's centre. The floods didn't reach Dr Sullivan's place, but she still sees the pain they caused all around her. ""An awful lot of my friends lost every single thing they have in the world,"" she says. ""It's just heartbreaking."" There is now much soul-searching about the best long-term responses to disasters like this, and many face the agonising question of whether to stay or move. After two major floods in little more than a month, Lismore is facing an existential crisis. Should residents stay or go — and where? The community as a whole needs to be involved in ""redesigning"" the town so it has long-term resilience against such disasters, says Dr Sullivan, whose main affiliation is now as an adjunct professor at the UNSW Water Research Centre. Part of that redesign could involve relocating those most at risk. To some extent, she says, it's about letting nature run its course, an approach pioneered by countries like The Netherlands. As part of a program that literally made ""room for the river"", the low-lying country bought back many farms for the flood plain. ""Instead of trying to control the river into channels and make it do what we say, the Dutch said, 'We know rivers are dynamic and therefore we must leave room for them to move'."" But there's so much more that could be done to work with nature to reduce the risk of flooding, Dr Sullivan adds. Restoring river and wetland ecosystems, covering more of our towns in vegetation, and keeping our catchments forested could all help reduce the impact of floods. They're interventions inspired by the processes and functioning of nature. The tropical island state of Singapore — which gets a lot of rain — has already embraced such nature-based solutions. ""Singapore used to have very large concrete drains to reduce flooding, but this is ugly and doesn't have any ecological or social benefits,"" says urban sustainability expert, Perrine Hamel of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. But over a decade ago it launched a water management program that included ""naturalising"" the city's river by greening its banks and surrounding it with beautiful, biodiverse parklands. Urban areas are particularly prone to flash flooding because impermeable surfaces like concrete and asphalt cause water to run off and accumulate in low-lying areas. The park around the river is not only a great place for people to gather when it's dry, but provides an area where excess water can soak into the ground and cause less havoc. Other nature-based flood mitigation initiatives in Singapore include using swales — vegetated drains on slopes, which slow down water run-off, reducing its destructive potential; and wetlands on the lowest-lying areas, which help protect the city from coastal flooding. Dr Hamel says traditional engineering solutions (sometimes called ""grey infrastructure"") like dams and levees are still important, but have their limitations. ""They have a huge carbon footprint, and they can fail."" And, she adds, they also displace the problem downstream. ""If you are getting rid of the water as fast as possible, this water still goes somewhere, and it can lead to flooding downstream."" And dams can be controversial. Jason Byrne from the University of Tasmania studies climate change adaptation and says Australia has a long way to catch up to places like Singapore. ""They are deploying nature-based solutions right across the city state … they're light years ahead of us."" Professor Byrne says some ""green infrastructure"" techniques to reduce run-off, like green roofs, have been trialed in cities like Melbourne. Other options include permeable pavements that soak up water, and street trees that do the same, and can have the added benefit of cooling cities. But evidence suggests the specific benefits of urban greening will depend on local conditions. A recent modelling study, for example, found that in most cities of the world, greening was unlikely to both cool the city and reduce flooding at the same time. ""Urban greening is not a panacea or silver bullet solution,"" Professor Byrne says. Experts say it will also be important to manage other issues that can occur with more nature in urban areas — things like bushfire risk or mosquitoes — and to avoid varieties of trees that suck up too much water, leaving little for the rest of the environment. ""It really will be about making a complex set of trade-offs,"" Professor Byrne says. ""Planting the right tree in the right place will be critically important."" Having a bushfire-smart garden is not just about what you plant and where, but how well you look after it too. If greenspace helps soak up water into the landscape, this could not only help guard against flooding, but save more groundwater to feed rivers in the dry times — something that's important for water security. The deep roots of trees are particularly good at helping water infiltrate into the soil, which has led to studies of how deforestation can make flooding worse in downstream towns. ""If we deforest those catchments for agricultural purposes, it means there's less vegetation around to catch that rainfall and evaporate it back out into the atmosphere,"" Professor Byrne says. But nature will always have the capacity to surprise us with large floods, especially in a changing climate, and there are limits to how much forests can absorb. If there is too much rain, a catchment gets soaked and can't absorb any more, which is why we need to have land downstream set aside that can be flooded without causing too many problems. Despite these limits, Dr Hamel and colleagues argued in a recent paper that models often underestimated the impacts of nature-based solutions like forests. Even small reductions in flood peak and flow could make a big difference to how badly communities are affected, they say. And since smaller floods are more frequent, their impacts add up. Putting exact figures on the benefits of nature-based solutions can be tricky and models have to be specific for individual catchments, Dr Hamel says. See how a town can adapt to severe storms and bushfires in this award-winning ABC augmented reality experience. Still, momentum is growing in support of nature-based solutions, likely in part because they can have a multitude of benefits. The World Bank's Global Program on Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Resilience is funding projects all over the world. And there's even talk about getting the insurance industry to invest in nature-based solutions to save money in the long run. Back in Australia, Dr Sullivan, who knows the Lismore community well, is among a group of researchers who wants to look more at the potential of this approach. Unfortunately, the interdisciplinary national flood research centre she headed closed not long after it was opened, due to lack of funding But this hasn't stopped her applying for federal grants to study how nature-based solutions might contribute to mitigating floods in the Richmond catchment, which includes Lismore. This is something the local community itself has said it wants to explore. Dr Sullivan is aware of the challenges. ""Nature-based solutions feel a bit intangible because it's lots of little things, not one single big thing like a dam wall that everyone can focus on."" More farmers are choosing to combine conservation with agriculture and the benefits are paying off. And research will need to look at the best way of getting the community to work together to benefit the whole catchment. This might require removing economic and regulatory disincentives, she says, citing the example of a farmer who had to pay extra rates after establishing a wetland on their property — because it was classed as a farm dam. ""Why would a farmer want to do that if they have to pay more money,"" Dr Sullivan says. ""It's much broader than just hydrological modeling. It's a whole system issue, so we have to take a wholistic approach."" Dr Sullivan says she's aware of skepticism about nature-based solutions, but thinks it's imperative we add them to our toolkit of flood responses. ""Rather than trying to hold nature back, we need to work with nature, and let nature work for us."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

111,He lives in a 'technology monastery' and has a child named X Æ A-12. Here's what else we know about Elon Musk,science," Science Elon Musk will soon own Twitter. Who is he, and how did he get to be the world's richest person? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog He's a space rocket mogul, an electric car salesman, a purveyor of satellite internet, and a madcap inventor. He's also a celebrity entrepreneur, Twitter troll, and the guy who once dated Canadian musician Grimes. Oh, and he's the world's richest person. Elon Musk has done, or become, all these things in the space of a decade. If Google Trends is any guide, he came to the attention of many Australians in February 2018, when he launched a Tesla sports car into space, using a rocket from another of his companies, Space X. Attention spiked again in May 2020, when he and his then partner Grimes confirmed they had named their baby X Æ A-12. Twitter has agreed to accept a $61 billion takeover bid from billionaire Elon Musk. Here's what it means for Twitter users. Now it's trending once more, with news that the longtime critic of Twitter has clinched a deal to buy the social media platform for $US44 billion ($61.4 billion). The price tag was just a sixth of his net worth. Often courting the profile of an irreverent trickster or troll, (he recently sold $US5 billion in Tesla stock after polling Twitter for advice), Mr Musk is now one of the most powerful people in the world. With the purchase of Twitter, he has direct control over a platform populated by millions of users and global leaders. And the move comes as the world is keenly aware of the potential for data mining, election hacking, and other campaigns of disinformation and influence. So, who IS Elon Musk, what are his political beliefs, and how does he have so much money? Elon Reeve Musk was born in 1971 in South Africa to a wealthy family. His Canadian mother was a professional dietician and model (her image graced cereal boxes) and his South African father was an engineer who once co-owned a Zambian emerald mine. Mr Musk's grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was the Canadian leader of the original technocratic movement, which believed in replacing politicians with whoever had the most expertise. (As an adult, Mr Musk would show a similar belief that scientists and engineers can solve political problems that others cannot). His parents separated when he was nine, and around this time he developed a keen interest in computer programming, even coding a video game that he sold to a magazine for $500 — you can still play it online. An awkward and introverted child who was severely bullied at high school in South Africa, he moved to Canada in 1989 with his mother, sister, and brother. Here's a brief timeline of his subsequent career: On January 1, 2020, Elon Musk's net worth was $US28 billion. Just a year later it was $US170 billion. The reason for this increase is the Telsa share price, which has tripled in value to more than $US1 trillion over the past 18 months (his shares are worth about $US170 billion). Mr Musk's 48 per cent stake in the $US100 billion firm SpaceX makes up most of the rest of his fortune. Mr Musk has donated to both Democrats and Republicans while declaring himself a ""moderate"" and a ""socialist"". According to data gathered by the non-profit lobbying watchdog Open Secrets, Elon Musk has given a total of $US1.2m to politicians, parties, political action committees (PACs), and referendum campaigns since 2002. That money went almost equally to Democrats, with $542,000, and Republicans, with $574,500. Some have described him as ""socially liberal and fiscally conservative"". Mr Musk, for instance, has advocated for releasing people imprisoned in the US for cannabis offences before the drug was legalised. Others say he's best described as a libertarian, meaning he advocates for only minimal government intervention in the free market and the private lives of citizens. He's proposed that future Martian colonies should allow any law to be overturned by a vote of 40 per cent of the citizens. On economic matters, he's campaigned against government subsidies to boost electric vehicle sales and opposed trade unions, especially in his own companies, as barriers to efficient operations. Tesla has tried to sabotage union efforts at its factory, and, in 2018, Mr Musk tweeted that Tesla employees who attempted to unionise would lose their stock options, which the courts have ruled was illegal. Mr Musk also sometimes seems to flirt with social conservatism, recently telling followers to ""take the red pill"" (a phrase used by white supremacist, anti-feminists, and conspiracy theorists in general) while engaged in a crusade against California's COVID lockdown policies. On climate issues, Mr Musk has argued for a carbon tax to better reflect the cost of fossil fuels to the environment, and publicly criticised then president Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. In 2021, he rethought his support for bitcoin, due to the currency's carbon emissions. Though sometimes critical of President Joe Biden, Mr Musk has also shown support: ""I'm super fired up that the new administration is focused on climate,"" he said after the president's inauguration. ""I feel very optimistic about the future of sustainable energy with the new administration."" There's also another side to Elon Musk — one that is less predictable and doesn't easily fit the usual categories of political and economic theory. This is the side that courts controversy and enjoys the adulation of his numerous followers, who appear to like his edgy, irreverent persona and are inspired by his bold visions for the future. It's the side that, for instance, tweeted an April fool's joke that saw billions knocked off the market value of Tesla. Some see Mr Musk's purchase of Twitter as the ultimate trolling of the social media platform. In a statement, Mr Musk said it was about ""freedom of speech"": ""Freedom of speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated."" Ironically, given how cutting edge Mr Musk is, that vision of the internet is old fashioned. It harks back to the days before misinformation and election hacking, when the internet could be freer and unmoderated. Either way, from EVs to Twitter, we're all living in Elon Musk's future now.

112,First all-private astronaut team returns safely from landmark space station visit,science,"  SpaceX crew return to earth after two-week mission on International Space Station Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The first all-private astronaut team to board the International Space Station (ISS) has safely splashed down in the Atlantic off Florida's coast, concluding a two-week science mission hailed as a landmark in commercialised human spaceflight. The SpaceX crew capsule carrying the four-man team, led by a retired NASA astronaut who is now vice-president of the Texas company behind the mission, Axiom Space, parachuted into the sea after a 16-hour descent from orbit. The splashdown capped the latest, and most ambitious, in a recent series of rocket-powered expeditions bankrolled by private investment capital and wealthy passengers. The mission's crew was assembled, equipped and trained entirely at private expense by Axiom, a five-year-old venture based in Houston and headed by NASA's former ISS program manager. Axiom also has contracted with NASA to build the first commercial addition to and ultimate replacement for the space station. SpaceX, the launch service founded by Tesla Inc electric car-maker CEO Elon Musk, supplied the Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule that carried Axiom's team to and from orbit, controlled the flight and handled the splashdown recovery. NASA, which has encouraged the further commercialisation of space travel, furnished the launch site at its Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and assumed responsibility for the Axiom crew while they were aboard the space station. The U.S. space agency's ISS crew members also pitched in to assist the private astronauts when needed. The multinational Axiom team was led by Spanish-born retired NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria, 63, the company's vice president for business development. His second-in-command was Larry Connor, 72, a technology entrepreneur and aerobatics aviator from Ohio designated the mission pilot. Joining them as ""mission specialists"" were investor-philanthropist and former Israeli fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe, 64, and Canadian businessman and philanthropist Mark Pathy, 52. Connor, Stibbe and Pathy flew as customers of Axiom, which charges $50 million to $60 million per seat for such flights, according to Mo Islam, head of research for the investment firm Republic Capital, which holds stakes in both Axiom and SpaceX. The splashdown, carried live by an Axiom-SpaceX webcast, was originally planned for last Wednesday, but the return flight was delayed and the mission extended about a week due to windy weather. The potential costs of such an extension were factored into Axiom's contracts with NASA and its customers, so none of the parties bore any additional charges, the company said. The return from orbit followed a re-entry plunge through Earth's atmosphere generating frictional heat that sent temperatures surrounding the outside of the capsule soaring to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit 1,927 degrees Celsius). Applause was heard from the SpaceX flight control center in suburban Los Angeles as parachutes billowed open above the capsule in the final stage of its descent — slowing its fall to about 15 miles per hour (24 kph) — and again as the craft hit the water off the coast of Jacksonville. In less than an hour, the heat-scorched Crew Dragon was hoisted onto a recovery ship before the capsule's side hatch was opened and the four astronauts, garbed in helmeted white-and-black spacesuits, were helped out one by one onto the deck. All were visibly unsteady on their feet from over two weeks spent in a weightless environment. Each received a quick onboard check-up before they were flown back to Florida for more thorough medical evaluations. ""Everybody looks great and is doing reasonably well,"" Axiom operations director Derek Hassmann told a post-splashdown news briefing, describing the astronauts as being ""in great spirits."" Axiom, SpaceX and NASA have touted the occasion as a milestone in the expansion of privately funded space-based commerce, constituting what industry insiders call the ""low-Earth orbit economy,"" or ""LEO economy"" for short. ""We proved that we can prepare the crew in a way that makes them effective and productive on orbit,"" Hassmann said. ""What it demonstrates to the world is that there is a new avenue to get to low-Earth orbit."" Launched on April 8, the Axiom team spent 17 days in orbit, 15 of those aboard the space station with the seven regular, government-paid ISS crew members: three American astronauts, a German astronaut and three Russian cosmonauts. The ISS has hosted several wealthy space tourists from time to time over the years. But the Axiom quartet was the first all-commercial team ever welcomed to the space station as working astronauts, bringing with them 25 science and biomedical experiments to conduct in orbit. The package included research on brain health, cardiac stem cells, cancer and ageing, as well as a technology demonstration to produce optics using the surface tension of fluids in microgravity. It was the sixth human spaceflight for SpaceX in nearly two years, following four NASA astronaut missions to the ISS and the ""Inspiration 4"" flight in September that sent an all-private crew into Earth orbit for the first time, though not to the space station. SpaceX has been hired to fly three more Axiom astronaut missions to ISS over the next two years.

113,"If waste coal seam gas salt needs 'active management forever', who's going to pay for it?",science," ABC Rural Queensland's coal seam gas industry still has a big salt problem Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A leading environmental engineer says the issue of waste salt from the coal seam gas industry has been underestimated and the ""preferred"" industry plan ""needs active management forever"". The Queensland government has just released the latest draft of its Coal Seam Gas Brine Management Action Plan. It was estimated that over the next 20 to 30 years up to six million tonnes of waste salt would be produced by the Queensland coal seam gas industry (CSG), a significant reduction from the previously estimated 15 million tonnes. But environmental engineer Professor Stuart Khan from the University Of New South Wales said it was still ""really very significant"". ""I think when people first start thinking about this problem they think about a truckload of salt, perhaps, that might be shipped out and disposed of somewhere safely,"" he said. ""But actually, we're talking about thousands of truckloads of salt."" The Queensland government's plan for managing waste salt is based on analysis by the University of Queensland's Centre for Natural Gas which is partly funded by three of the largest gas companies operating in the state — Arrow Energy, Santos, and APLNG. The information UQ has analysed was provided by the peak body for the petroleum and gas industry, The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA). To release coal seam gas, groundwater is pumped to the surface and separated. A lot of this water is very salty and cannot be used without being processed. The salt is removed from the groundwater by either reverse osmosis plants or through plastic-lined evaporation ponds, and both processes create waste brine or salt. Currently the ""preferred"" method of long term storage of the waste salt is to bury it in sealed landfill sites, which is called salt encapsulation. ""The problem is that sort of salt encapsulation requires ongoing management,"" Professor Khan said. ""There will be leachate when it rains, that leachate needs to be managed, treated, salt probably replaced back into the landfill. It needs active management forever."" A spokesperson for the Queensland Department of Environment and Science (DES) said it continued to work with the industry, landholders, and environmental groups on a plan for the long-term storage of waste CSG salt. Ian Hayllor's neighbours oppose coal seam gas and he himself was once a sceptic — so why is he now supporting the industry? The DES did not specifically address questions about the long-term cost of managing waste CSG salt and who would pay. ""While encapsulation of salt has been identified as the most viable long-term solution, salt encapsulation facilities are not currently used by the industry,"" the DES spokesperson said. ""Any proposed encapsulation facility would be subject to a rigorous assessment process … including consideration for land rehabilitation and long-term management measures."" Third-generation cattle farmer Glen Beasley lives close to the We Kando waste facility near Chinchilla in southern Queensland, which has approvals to hold CSG salt. He said he was worried because it was on the Condamine River catchment. ""The possibility of contamination from either overfill of the ponds or leakage into the water table, the potential there is serious,"" Mr Beasley said. ""This is a legacy that future generations are going to have to deal with."" The ABC has contacted We Kando and understands it currently has no CSG waste salt on-site, and it has no short to medium-term plans to take any CSG waste salt. Shay Dougall, a Chinchilla local who advocates for landholders dealing with coal seam gas development, said the biggest ongoing problem for many was the lack of transparency. ""I don't believe this has been publicly dealt with properly, I don't think enough information is been made available,"" she said. ""And if it was, the information that's been made available today shows that this is going to be a long-term problem that has no real solution to it.""

114,Trump's return? New features? Here's what we know about the future of Twitter,science,"  Elon Musk is set to buy Twitter. How will the platform change and will Trump be allowed back? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Twitter has agreed to accept a $US44 billion ($61.3 billion) takeover bid from billionaire Elon Musk in a deal that's set to shake up the social media platform as we know it. Efforts to moderate free speech on Twitter will likely be the big change, which could allow controversial voices back onto the platform, such as former US president Donald Trump. Mr Musk has publicly criticised the platform's moderation of speech on several occasions. ""Freedom of speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Mr Musk said in a statement. But what does this mean for Twitter users and how will the platform change? Wedbush analyst Dan Ives says Twitter users can expect ""a shake-up"". But even Mr Ives admits there's more questions than answers at this point. ""I think, ultimately, this is really going to be a 12- to 18-month project to try to transform Twitter,"" he said. Twitter's board of directors chair, Bret Taylor, says the company will operate as it has been until the deal is closed. ""I think we feel very comfortable that [the deal] gives this team the ability to continue to make the company successful in between signing and closing the transaction,"" Mr Taylor says. Mr Musk said last week that he had lined up $US46.5 billion ($64.7 billion) in financing for the purchase. Documents filed with US securities regulators showed that Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and other banks had promised to lend him $US25.5 billion, underwritten by Musk's Tesla shares. Mr Musk is understood to have covered the remaining billions himself. Not a whole lot will change right away because the deal has not closed yet. However, Mr Musk has mentioned what he would like to change in a series of tweets over the past two weeks, these include: He also posted a poll on Twitter on April 4, asking his followers if they'd like an edit button. There has been some speculation that controversial celebrities and political figures such as Mr Trump will be allowed back on the platform, but the former US president says he won't be rejoining Twitter. He told Fox News that he would, instead, focus on his own social media platform, Truth Social. “I am not going on Twitter. I am going to stay on Truth,” Mr Trump said. “I hope Elon buys Twitter because he’ll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth.” Mr Trump was barred from Twitter after the deadly January 6, 2021 insurrection, when protesters stormed the US Capitol building. Shareholders are yet to weigh in but the deal is expected to close some time this year. A shareholder vote could be held as soon as May 25, at the company’s annual meeting. Regulators also need to review the deal, however, Wedbush analyst Mr Ives says no major hurdles are expected. The process is off to a good start for Mr Musk, given that Twitter’s board has unanimously approved his offer and is recommending shareholders do the same.

115,"After drought and fires, there's something not quite right about Eleanor's mountain home",science,"  Young people are on front line of climate change, but they're not accepting it as an inevitability Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog In Bellawongarah, sundown is replaced by a moment of silence. Then the ""symphony of the evening"" begins. The gentle rustling of trees gives way to a cacophony of croaks and hoots as nature comes alive. ""I never even realised how amazing and extraordinary it all was,"" 16-year-old Eleanor reflects on her childhood. ""A lot of kids wouldn't get to experience that."" Nestled between Berry and the Kangaroo Valley in the NSW Shoalhaven region, about 130 people call the quaint mountain community home. Surrounded by temperate rainforest and rolling valleys, it's easy to understand Bellawongarah's hold. However, in recent years, something has changed. First, the frogs and snakes disappeared, and with it the amphibians' nightly melody — the side-effect of a drought that relegated dams to a ""murky puddle"" and dried out the once-damp rainforest. Then the bushfires came. While Eleanor's parents' property was spared, as she watched wildlife seek shelter in her back yard from the inferno around them, the magnitude of the situation became clear. ""It was quite scary because, for months on end, we just could smell smoke in the air just travelling up the coast,"" she says. ""But it did also make me want to act and to speak out after seeing the effects of climate change in my own life and my own community."" Young Australians are front and centre of the climate crisis and, in the face of extreme weather events across the country, it's a story shaped by personal experience. Our World, Our Say — the nation's largest consultation of children and young people on climate change and disaster risk, led by the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience and World Vision — surveyed 1,447 young Australians between the ages of 10 and 24 years. The 2020 report found that than 80 per cent of participants aged over 16 years were concerned or extremely concerned about climate change. Greater than 90 per cent of those surveyed reported experiencing at least one natural hazard event in the three years prior, while 63 per cent felt that disasters were occurring more often. ""We had to evacuate with the bushfires, which obviously was a major experience that I'll always remember,"" Eleanor says. ""And so people just think, 'Oh, it's just climate change, it's just the world warming'. But it's got such major consequences."" As swathes of Australia's east coast grapple with the fallout from sustained rainfall and flash flooding, the conversation has again turned to the nation's climate response. However, this time, it's young people who are making their voice heard. As tens of thousands of students descended on School Strike For Climate rallies across the country last month, teenagers affected by the floods spoke of becoming ""climate refugees"". ""Have you ever had to flee from your house, in the middle of the night, in the middle of a storm, scared out of your mind because you don't know what's going to happen, or if you will survive, or if your house will still be OK, or if your friends are OK?"" Ella O'Dwyer-Oshlack, 13 — who lost her house during Lismore's flood catastrophe — told crowds outside Kirribilli House. ""It's not something I would wish on anyone."" Emerging Australian and international evidence suggests that children and young people who are directly exposed to extreme weather events are at risk of a range of psychological effects. Jen Spears was pregnant during the Black Summer bushfires and when her baby was born her doctor said she had the ""placenta of a heavy smoker"". One study investigating the impact of 2020's Black Summer bushfires on young people — led by researchers at the University of New England — found that those directly exposed to the crisis reported significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress, adjustment disorder symptoms, as well as drug and alcohol use than those who were not. The study — which involved a survey of 740 young people in New South Wales between the ages of 16 and 25 years — also found that those who were directly exposed were more likely to believe that climate change was going to affect them, or people they knew. Associate Professor Amy Lykins says there needs to be a greater focus on bolstering support services in regional and rural communities to build psychological resilience to challenges that climate change will bring. ""Building that up and building up that community capacity is really important to help provide better opportunities for resilience going into the future,"" she says. ""Because it's not like these are one-off events. They are going to keep happening."" With the Black Summer fires preceded by severe droughts in some areas, and followed by floods in others, experts also point to the cascading and compounding impacts of successive major weather events, which can affect people's ability to recover. As young people find themselves on the front line of climate change, the classroom has become somewhat of a battleground. In Western Australia, an inquiry into the response of schools to climate change is currently underway, while Victoria's draft climate change adaptation plan is exploring what can be done to ensure schools and early childhood education services are able to ""withstand more extreme weather"". While the complexity of climate change may leave some feeling there is little that can be done at an individual level, in a classroom in Canberra, one teenager is trying to change the climate around climate change, one student at a time. ""I think it's important to know that, no matter how small you think things are, they actually add up to make a big impact,"" says Joji, 16. For the high school student, it's a topic as exciting as it is challenging. When he first joined his school's environment group, he was faced with a quandary: How do you get a bunch of teenagers to think recycling is interesting? ""I thought, 'Why don't we do something that's really different?' If it's funny, it's memorable and people are more likely to remember the messages,"" Joji says. During their monthly assembly, the group stages wheelie bin races and ""Binja Warrior"" style obstacle courses, where contestants must dodge obstacles to put rubbish in the bin. It's an unconventional strategy designed to ""bridge the gap between our actions and impacts"", and create a connection between the smell of sorting bins and the camaraderie of competition. ""Our work in the environment group has showed that people do care, that they are able to change their habits for the good of the environment,"" Joji says. ""We can be doing small things to tackle some of these climate issues."" Reflecting on the future, Joji is candid: ""I think there's still time to change."" ""There's definitely still time and that, if we change our habits now, we'll be able to stop climate change from becoming a big problem in the future,"" he says. Summer hibernation, sweltering days, more natural disasters. As the world watches Glasgow, is this the future for Australia’s children? For Eleanor, who has seen the changes on her property first-hand, it's a sentiment that prompts mixed emotions. The onus has been put on younger generations to come up with a solution to climate change, she says. ""But, I think, we've got to the point where there isn't a solution. We just can slow it down."" After fires tore through the landscape around Bellawongarah, the rains followed — and, with it, the once-lost frogs and snakes returned. These days, life almost resembles what it once did. However, the wood ducks don't breed there anymore, Eleanor says, while animals once deterred by the temperature and altitude now feel at home further up the mountain.

116,Why are so many minor parties talking about digital ID laws?,science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog United Australia Party and One Nation candidates are stirring up fear about a proposed digital identity bill in a last-ditch effort to mobilise their voter base, experts say. Millions of Australians are already using a digital identity through myGovID, which links data across several government services including Medicare and Centrelink. In October last year, the federal government released draft legislation to expand the system to more state and territory services and the private sector. But while there are legitimate privacy concerns about the voluntary scheme, several political candidates have been spreading fear about the scheme in a bid for votes, linking it to a globalist plot or a ploy to introduce a Chinese-style social credit system. The United Australia Party ran a YouTube ad titled Don't Let The Government Do This To Us, claiming, ""there will be a social credit system, like what there is in China"". Google's ad transparency tool provides only a broad estimate of ad spend, but the party may have spent more than $500,000 promoting the clip, reaching more than 2 million views. Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues One Nation in particular have made opposition to the digital identity system a significant part of their platform. In a Facebook post last week that attracted more than 5,000 interactions, One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts claimed the digital identity bill would ""form the basis of banning cash, controlling data, selling data to globalists & returning people to feudalism & globalist control"". Newly minted One Nation candidate George Christensen regularly shares posts about it with his more than 27,000 Telegram channel subscribers. Claims that the digital identity bill is being pushed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) so global elites will have control over individual data have also been shared on social media by candidates from the United Australia Party and The Great Australian Party in recent weeks. This sentiment echoes posts shared on Australian anti-vaccine, anti-lockdown and far-right Telegram groups throughout the pandemic which focus on comments made by WEF founder Klaus Schwab as ""evidence"" of a scheme for governments to introduce ubiquitous tracking and control. The rhetoric being used to discuss Australia's digital ID scheme could be seen as a last-ditch effort to attract votes from Australia's anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine movements. Elise Thomas, an analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, suggested the fear campaign was currently being pushed by some minor party candidates because many of these groups have ""run out of steam"" on other issues with which to mobilise their base. ""They've realised they're not making much headway with the anti-vaccine mandates stuff anymore,"" she said. ""In some ways, we'll see them casting around for some other kind of narratives to mobilise against."" Away from the cameras, candidates are fighting for your vote: in your social media feed, on your phone and in your letterbox. Help us uncover these hidden tactics. While many of the social media posts frame Australia's digital identity scheme as something entirely new and sinister, the draft legislation expands an existing scheme. The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) says the bill ""provides assurance to consumers that their privacy and security is protected"", however, there are still questions about how the system will function and how individual data will be protected. RMIT researcher Kelsie Nabben is concerned about the security of the data. ""Collecting large amounts of personal information creates a potentially valuable target,"" she said. ""By putting the population's data into a centralised database, it does create what we call a honey pot, which is just a target for hackers."" Executive Director at Digital Rights Watch James Clark agreed there were privacy concerns with the proposed legislation. ""We know that identity information is really valuable,"" he said. ""If it's misused, or if there's a security breach, people can't simply change their face or their fingerprint, like they could with a password."" Clark said there needed to be ""rigorous public debate"" about the scheme and suggested that a lack of transparency and media coverage about the proposed legislation had led to a surge in conspiracy theories. ""It does come in the context of a digital climate where digital technology is increasingly being used to track and surveil people,"" he said, ""so I can see how that has caused a kind of concern and leads to conspiratorial thinking. ""But certainly these conspiracy theories are often a distraction from real privacy and security concerns."" There have been longstanding concerns in Australia about attempts to create a unified identity. In the mid-1980s, a proposal for a national identification card to be called the ""Australia Card"" was abandoned over privacy fears. During the pandemic, however, these worries found new life: Conspiracy theories about digital identity schemes as a pretext for government control have been shared since the early months of the pandemic in 2020. Stevie Zhang, an associate editor with disinformation-tracking project FirstDraft, said many of these ideas evolved from concerns about the implementation of ""vaccine passports"". They pointed to speeches in parliament from the United Australia Party's Craig Kelly, who claimed vaccine passports were a way for the government to ""coerce people into participating in a medical experiment"", and then-Coalition MP George Christensen, who likened them to ""scenarios from some dystopian novel about a totalitarian government"". ""The [digital ID] scheme has been seen as the local enactment of these globalist conspiracy theories,"" Zhang said. Fearmongering over digital ID, particularly by comparing it to a social credit system, has continued in recent months. The UAP in particular have released a number of videos on this theme, which Zhang said could be an attempt to capitalise on Sinophobia. ""My instinct is that it comes from … 'we don't want to become like them',"" they said. ""Rather than legitimate fears about how it can happen."" Great Australian Party leader Rod Culleton told the ABC there was ""no evidence [that candidates are spreading unfounded claims or conspiracies] … I support good, measured, democratic opinion"". In a statement, issued after publication, a spokesperson for Senator Malcom Roberts said his ""messaging around the Digital Identity bill come from the information that is contained on the government's website and therefore would not represent a conspiracy theory"".

117,"This COVID test promises results in a few minutes, and you don't have to stick a swab up your nose",science," Coronavirus Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Whether it is a PCR test or the at-home variety, sending a swab up the nose to swirl around and test for COVID-19 has become a familiar but uncomfortable part of living through the pandemic. However, what if there was an alternative? For the first time, health authorities in the United States have given the green light to a COVID-19 breathalyser, a device promised to deliver results in less than three minutes. As new sub-variants once again push up case numbers, some experts hope it will be the first of many new tools to diagnose and, therefore, improve the way we live with the virus. There is even hope breath testing could eventually be used to detect and monitor other conditions, such as cancer. So just how advanced is the technology? And could it actually replace the nasal swabs we have come to know and loathe? The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorisation for a breathalyser produced by small Texas-based company, InspectIR. The test involves exhaling through a disposable straw into a device the size of a carry-on suitcase which then analyses so-called ""volatile organic compounds"" associated with the SARS-COV-2 infection. ""Essentially, when your body is fighting the illness, at a cellular level it creates off gas,"" co-founder and president John Redmond told the ABC. ""That gas is carried through your bloodstream to your lungs, and then is exhaled as waste. And, based on the sensitivity of our instrument, we can actually see that chemistry. ""And, based on analysis, we can determine if a person is sick or not."" The test has limitations. The FDA requires that it is conducted by a trained operator under the supervision of a healthcare provider and positive results are supposed to be confirmed by a PCR test. The cost of leasing the machines has not yet been made public, although the company insists it will be comparable to rapid antigen tests. Either way, it is a major step forward according to Cristina Davis, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at University of California Davis who is developing her own COVID-19 breath test. ""The way that there are dozens of at-home, over-the-counter COVID rapid antigen tests, I believe that there will be many [breath] devices that will come onto the scene at some point in the next year or year and a half,"" she says. Professor Davis wants to see them used as screening tools at crowded venues such as stadiums or airports, with guests asked to wait several minutes for their result before entering. It is hoped they could also help to prevent so-called ""superspreader"" events, such as the exclusive dinner in Washington DC earlier this month where more than 70 people — including members of Joe Biden's cabinet — are thought to have been infected. As it has done for other innovations — such as mRNA vaccines and telehealth — the pandemic has helped to focus attention and funding on breath research. Perena Gouma, a professor of materials science and engineering, was working on a breath test to detect the flu when COVID-19 began. ""I received a phone call from the White House. They had read my flu breathalyser paper and they said, 'Can you make a test for COVID-19?'"" Professor Gouma says. She and her team at Ohio State University have since developed a test that, she says, can be self-administered and return a result in less than 30 seconds. Her test measures the make-up of various compounds in a person's breath to determine whether or not they have COVID-19 and how severe it is. Professor Gouma argues the test has a high accuracy rate and could ""revolutionise"" COVID-19 screening if it was rolled out widely. Rapid antigen tests provide results within minutes, but they also have their limitations. Here are a few things to keep in mind. However, her efforts to obtain emergency use authorisation from the FDA have so far been unsuccessful. ""I'm a little bit furious because — after having spent two years really working on this technology day and night, and making everything so available to everybody, so transparent — then we got this result,"" she says. The FDA says it does not discuss the status of pending applications. Professor Davis says the scientific community is only just scratching the surface of the field's potential. Eventually, she hopes breath testing could be used to diagnose or monitor conditions such as cancer. ""Breath research doesn't have to just be about the lung, interestingly, because what we're measuring from the exhaled breath is really representative of the entire body,"" Professor Davis says. ""It's not just about diagnostics, I think going forward we're going to see monitoring as a key thing. ""If you're taking a treatment for something, you could be monitoring, 'OK, how's that working?' ""It just gives more information to doctors so that they can help patients individually manage their own health conditions."" COVID-19 testing has come a long way since the start of the pandemic, with RATs now relatively widely available alongside the ""gold standard"" PCRs. However, while access has improved, some experts fear an increasing reliance on at-home testing has also made it more difficult for authorities to track case numbers. And that could mean they are less prepared for further waves. ""We are vastly under-counting what is going on in this country,"" says Maureen Miller, an epidemiologist at Columbia University's Mailman school of public health. ""I mean, it is great to have the technology so you can test at home, so you can protect yourself and those around you. ""But several recent studies have shown that people who test at home, [only] between 7 and 10 per cent report their results. Perversely, positive people tend not to report their results."" Case numbers are not the only measure used to track COVID-19, with hospital admission rates and wastewater surveillance also used to monitor its spread. More than two years into the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have set up a new forecasting headquarters, aimed at becoming ""the equivalent of the National Weather Service for infectious diseases"". However, as new Omicron sub-variants drive another increase in cases, Dr Miller is concerned that the US is not as prepared as it could be. ""Will it be this enormous bump? No,"" she says, comparing it to Omicron's peak at the beginning of this year. ""But will it prolong the pandemic longer than it has to? Yeah, it's definitely going to do that.""

118,First all-private astronaut team undocks from International Space Station for 16-hour return flight,science,"  First all-private astronaut team undocks from International Space Station for 16-hour return flight Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The first all-private astronaut team ever to fly aboard the International Space Station (ISS) departed the orbiting outpost on Monday to begin a descent back to Earth, capping a two-week science mission hailed as a milestone in commercial spaceflight. A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying the four-man team from the Houston-based startup company Axiom Space undocked from the ISS at about 11:10am AEST on Monday to embark on a 16-hour return flight, a live NASA webcast showed. The Axiom astronauts, garbed in their helmeted white-and-black spacesuits, were seen strapped into the crew cabin shortly before the spacecraft separated from the station, orbiting some 420 km above Earth. A couple of brief rocket thrusts then pushed the capsule safely clear of the ISS. If all goes smoothly, the Dragon capsule, dubbed Endeavour, will parachute into the Atlantic off the coast of Florida on Tuesday at 3:00am AEST. The flight home was postponed for several days due to unfavourable weather at the splashdown zone, extending the Axiom crew's stay in orbit well beyond its original departure date early last week. The multinational team was led by Spanish-born retired NASA astronaut Michael López-Alegría, 63, Axiom's vice-president for business development. Larry Connor, 72, a real estate-technology entrepreneur and aerobatics aviator from Ohio, was the second in command. Rounding out the Ax-1 crew were investor-philanthropist and former Israeli fighter pilot Eytan Stibbe, 64, and Canadian businessman and philanthropist Mark Pathy, 52, both serving as mission specialists. Launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on April 8, they spent two weeks aboard ISS with the seven regular, government-paid crew of the space station: three American astronauts, a German astronaut and three Russian cosmonauts. The Axiom quartet became the first all-commercial astronaut team ever launched to the space station, taking with them equipment for two dozen science experiments, biomedical research and technology demonstrations to conduct in orbit. Axiom, NASA and SpaceX have touted the mission as a turning point in the expansion of privately funded space-based commerce, constituting what industry insiders call the ""low-Earth-orbit economy,"" or ""LEO economy"" for short. Ax-1 marks the sixth human spaceflight SpaceX has launched in nearly two years, following four NASA astronaut missions to the ISS plus the Inspiration 4 flight in September, which sent an all-civilian crew into Earth orbit for the first time, though not to the space station. SpaceX, the private rocket company founded by Tesla Inc electric car maker CEO Elon Musk, has been contracted to fly three more Axiom astronaut missions to the ISS over the next two years. The price tag for such outings remains high. Axiom charges customers $US50 million to $US60 million ($70 million to $84 million) per seat, according to Mo Islam, head of research for the investment firm Republic Capital, which holds stakes in both Axiom and SpaceX. Axiom also was selected by NASA in 2020 to build a new commercial addition to the space station, which a US-Russian-led consortium of 15 countries has operated for more than two decades. Plans call for the Axiom segment to eventually replace the ISS when the rest of the space station is retired around 2030.

119,Here's what happened when Elon Musk tweeted he was 'moving on',science,"  Elon Musk's 'moving on' tweet isn't about Twitter. It's about 'making fun' of Bill Gates Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk has posted a cryptic tweet online which fuelled further speculation about his plans to buy Twitter. The tweet was online for hours before Musk clarified that the post actually had nothing to do with his much-discussed bid to purchase the social media platform. Before we get to the tweet, a quick reminder on Musk's latest developments with Twitter. On April 4, the billionaire acquired a 9.1 per cent stake in the platform, making him Twitter's largest shareholder. He was set to join the board, but later backflipped on the decision. On April 14, he offered to buy Twitter outright for $US43 billion ($58 billion), which is about $72.87 per share. In a regulatory filing, Musk said he believed the company couldn't be a ""platform for free speech around the globe"" without drastic changes. In a letter to Twitter chairman Bret Taylor, he said"" ""Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."" On the weekend, with the company still considering his offer, Musk tweeted: 'Moving on ...' Followers immediately jumped on the post speculating it was linked to the Twitter deal. Among them was American businessman Jeremy Padawer who joked that ""there's always MySpace"", while others suspected he was already selling his shares in the platform. But it wasn't until hours later that he clarified what was really behind the post. In a reply to his original tweet, Musk explained that he was moving on ""from making fun of [Bill] Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action"". In finance, ""shorting"" a stock refers to an investor profiting if the value of an asset fails. Musk was suggesting Gates had stocks that would profit if his electric vehicle company, Tesla, failed. Gates hasn't responded in Musk's 'Moving on' thread. On Friday, a bunch of leaked texts, reportedly between Musk and Gates, had emerged online. The messages reportedly showed Musk asking Gates: ""Do you still have a half-billion-dollar short position against Tesla?"" The response, reportedly sent by Gates, said: ""Sorry to say I haven't closed it out."" A tweet by the user WholeMarsBlog included screenshots of the text messages and asked Musk if they were true. Musk responded to say they were, but denied he was behind the leak. Meanwhile, Twitter's board met on Sunday and are moving closer to a possible deal with the entrepreneur. They're expected to find Musk's offer for the company too low, ahead of reporting their quarterly earnings on Thursday. Some shareholders are pushing for the social media giant to seek a better deal from Musk. Whether that eventuates remains to be seen, after the billionaire made it clear he had delivered his first and final offer.

120,"Tallulah is the only known child in Australia with a 'currently incurable' condition, but researchers are on a quest to stop it",science,"  Girls brought together by Queensland research mission into rare brain disorder hereditary spastic paraplegia Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Two little girls from different parts of the globe who share an extremely rare and debilitating genetic brain disorder have been united by Queensland research aiming to find a breakthrough drug treatment. Sunshine Coast's Tallulah Whitrod, 3, and Singapore's Alissa Lim, 2, would probably have never met under normal circumstances, but their families have come together in Brisbane as part of a study into their devastating disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia. Researchers will analyse stem cells collected from inside Tallulah and Alissa's nasal cavities in a quest to find a drug that halts the progression of the disease or, in a ""fairyland"" scenario, reverses it. The girls inherited two abnormal copies of the SPG56 gene from both parents, resulting in a type of hereditary spastic paraplegia so unusual it occurs in fewer than one person out of every million. Tallulah is the only known child in Australia with the ""currently incurable"" condition and Alissa is the only diagnosed case in Singapore. So few children worldwide have hereditary spastic paraplegia type 56, that doctors are unable to tell their parents how the degenerative condition will progress or how long their daughters are likely to live. They are unable to talk, walk or even crawl. But both sets of parents say the disease has not robbed their girls of the ability to smile and experience joy. They take solace from their daughters' giggles while simultaneously fearing for their futures. The families first met online via a Facebook group for families of children with the same type of hereditary spastic paraplegia. They say finding the group has helped relieve the extreme loneliness they feel, as parents of children living with an ultra-rare medical condition. ""There are no rules and no book written to tell us what comes next, which is one of the most amazing things when meeting other parents,"" Tallulah's dad Chris Whitrod said. ""We get to share our knowledge."" His wife, Golden, added: ""That connection of just having someone who really knows what you've gone through, and what you're going through, is bonding in a very serious and lasting way."" Amid the grief of raising a child with an uncertain future, research led by 2017 Australian of the Year Alan Mackay-Sim at Griffith University has thrown the families a medical lifeline. The Whitrods, who also have a son Finn, 5, moved from Darwin to the Sunshine Coast last year to be closer to Emeritus Professor Mackay-Sim's research and have raised more than $500,000 since last June to help fund studies into Tallulah's form of hereditary spastic paraplegia. After searching the world for solutions to Tallulah's malady, they found the top scientists in their own backyard — Australia. ""As a family, we researched hard before we selected our research team,"" Mrs Whitrod said. ""We've got the best of the best. ""I feel so blessed in a way. I know that a lot of people think that sounds insane to say 'blessed' but these are the cards we got dealt. I just feel so lucky that we've been dealt them in a time when there is hope in research."" Professor Mackay-Sim describes his scientific work into rare diseases as like being a detective, searching for clues to help unlock the key to a mystery illness. ""We all read detective novels. At least, I do,"" he said. ""And it's the mystery of it happening that keeps you going. ""You're always searching around for clues as to what might be applicable to what you're doing."" The 70-year-old has been studying different forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) since 2006 with funding from the Australian-based HSP Research Foundation. More than 80 types of the condition have been identified, caused by defects in different genes. Using nasal stem cells, researchers at the Griffith Institute for Drug Discovery (GRIDD) have been able to screen drugs for their potential to reverse the impact of genetic mutations on those cells. The technique has already resulted in the identification of a drug candidate for a more common type of adult-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by a mutation in the SPG4 gene. They are hopeful of taking the drug to a patient trial. In that case, Professor Mackay-Sim's team identified an active ingredient, dubbed noscapine, in an approved cough medicine sold overseas. GRIDD researchers will use the same screening process in a bid to find a drug that can stop the progress of Tallulah and Alissa's disorder. Armed with Tallulah's genetic information and data on the biological mechanisms of known drugs, computational biologist Dr Alex Cristino has used artificial intelligence to select about 3,000 drugs already approved for other conditions to screen for their ability to normalise the girls' stem cells. ""There are thought to be more drugs in the world, at least potential drugs in the world, than there are stars in the universe,"" Professor Mackay-Sim said. ""We're narrowing that down to a selection of drugs which have already been used in the past."" If they find a hit from an approved drug, that would greatly reduce the time it takes for a human trial to be organised, given it would already have been tested for its safety in human patients. GRIDD cell biologist Vicky Avery will oversee the drug screening process. Professor Avery said the girls' stem cells would be compared to those of healthy participants. ""We treat the cells with a drug and compare images taken before and after treatment,"" she said. ""We are looking at the shape, size and the volume of the cells, plus a number of other different factors, to see whether or not the drugs are changing what the cells look like. ""Combining our image-based data with the computational expertise of Dr Cristino, we are able to rapidly identify potential drugs for further evaluation. ""We're seeking drugs that can modify an abnormal cell to become more like a normal cell in both appearance and function. ""If we can prevent the disease progressing that is a huge step. We're very hopeful."" While avoiding the word ""cure"", Professor Mackay-Sim said he was confident of ""finding some leads"" before the end of the year. If drug candidates are identified, they will then be validated at the University of Queensland's Australian Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, where scientist Ernst Wolvetang is using a different process to create functioning brain tissue — dubbed brain organoids — from the girls' white blood cells. Professor Wolvetang said having patient-specific brain organoids would inform the researchers about how SPG56 mutations affected brain development and function. He will test potential drugs on the lentil-sized organoids, which produce electrical activity that mimics human brain waves, to see whether they improve how the tissue functions. If they find a drug that can be taken to a human trial, the next challenge will be to fund it. Patient trials are expensive and extremely rare conditions are often neglected by drug companies and government funding bodies, such as the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Medical Research Future Fund. ""Drug companies are not going to touch it, there's no market,"" Professor Mackay-Sim said. But the Whitrods are on a mission not only to find a drug to treat Tallulah's disorder. They hope the drug screening process being trialled in Queensland can be used to inform future research into finding treatments for other extremely rare conditions, including other forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia. ""Rare diseases are many — about 300 million people globally live with a rare disease,"" Mrs Whitrod said. ""Even though big pharmaceutical companies aren't interested in funding something that doesn't give them big bang for their buck, the successful development of the treatments we are working on has real potential to accelerate the search for therapies to treat other types of hereditary spastic paraplegia, none of which has an effective treatment. ""I truly believe that if we can get the backing of the government and the backing of those big companies to help us to find a cure, this will be the stalking horse for many, many cures to come and help many, many people."" The Whitrods have established the Genetic Cures for Kids Foundation and named its first project Our Moon's Mission to help fund research for Tallulah, whose middle name is Moon, and other children with defective SPG56 genes. Their mission has given some comfort to Alissa's parents, Shannon and Gina, who, despite living in Singapore, considered to have one of the best healthcare systems in the world, have found little support there. ""We've been to playgrounds — other kids are running about and Alissa is just looking at them. It hits me quite badly,"" Mr Lim said. ""She's starting to lose a lot of her functions. It's quite tough to see her lose her ability to do things."" But after flying to Australia and meeting the Queensland researchers studying their daughter's disease, Mrs Lim said they had found ""definitely a lot more hope"" after months of doctors ""not giving any solutions"".

121,"'I'm the idiot that fell for it': How Kelly lost her $25,000 home deposit to scammers",science," Science Australia's overheated property market has become a target for hackers — and they're scamming millions Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The scammers' first email to Kelly and her husband arrived in the small hours of the night, when they were sleeping. ""Due to the ongoing bank audit on our account,"" the email read, ""please see attached our subsidiary trust account details for the payment of $25,000 deposit."" The email address looked legitimate — it was the real estate agent's. Kelly and her husband, both young engineers and ""tech savvy"", were at the pointy end of buying a house in Western Australia. And so the next day, Kelly's husband sent their hard-earned home deposit to a scammer, and never saw that money again. Property settlement scams are becoming more common as house prices rise and scammers turn their focus to the large and often lightly protected sums of money that prospective buyers are transferring to the trust accounts of real estate agents and conveyancers. Known as ""payment redirection"", it's part of a category of scams called ""business email compromise"", where criminals hack an employee's email account and then, impersonating that employee, send a payment request, substituting their own bank account details. The victims tend to be individual home buyers or small business owners, for whom the consequences of a lost deposit are devastating. Six months on, Kelly and her husband haven't yet told their parents or their friends that they got scammed. ""It's been very, very stressful,"" Kelly said. ""There's a lot of self-blame. You're ashamed — I'm the idiot that fell for it."" According to national figures, plenty of others are falling for the scam too. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Scamwatch receives on average about two reports per week of payment redirection scams in real estate. March 2022 saw 14 reports alone — the highest figure in 15 months. ""Twenty-five reports were made this year, which is an increase of 25 per cent on the same period in 2021 and losses this year are up 186 per cent to $1.8 million,"" an ACCC spokesperson said. NSW, which has the nation's most expensive property market, accounts for three-quarters of the $4.3 million lost through this scam around the country from January 2021 to the end of March 2022. Buyers aren't the only parties being targeted says Chris Tyler, chief executive officer of the NSW division of the Australian Institute of Conveyancers (AICNSW). Fraudsters have even used payment redirection to scam the stamp duty a conveyancer had intended to transfer to state revenue, he says. ""Because property transactions are so high in value, all the parties in the transaction are being targeted: The real estate agents, the mortgage brokers, the conveyancer. ""Half the time the deposit could be a couple hundred thousand dollars."" The Sydney law firm of Clyde & Co's cyber incident response team handles multiple business email compromise (BEC) incidents every week. ""We've noticed an uptick over the last three or four months,"" said Reece Corbett-Wilkins, a member of the response team. Though less ""sexy"" than ransomware, BEC is just as big a problem, he says. ""For every ransomware demand that I know gets paid, I can tell you 20 victims of a BEC scam, accounting for just as much if not more."" Clyde & Co saw a 150 per cent increase in reported BEC incidents from 2018 to 2021. In some cases, the losses are huge — a client of a client recently misdirected a $750,000 transaction. A 29-year-old Sydney woman faces court over an alleged property scam that fleeced $1 million from a prospective Canberra home buyer. ""The value of houses has gone up so much. There's a lot of cash flowing through the real estate sector,"" Mr Corbett-Wilkins said. The nature of real estate transactions, involving many parties and often not much cybersecurity, makes them a favourite target of scammers. ""These attacks are super sophisticated,"" he said. ""You've got this combination of factors that all come together and you think, well, this is ripe for the picking."" After Kelly's husband sent the scammers the $25,000, the scammers stayed in touch via email, maintaining the charade and allaying suspicion for long enough for the transfer to clear. ""I will issue a copy of our trust receipt once the funds hit our account,"" they wrote back to the couple. At the same time, the scammers were emailing the real estate agent, using an address that closely resembled Kelly's husband's, to assure them the home deposit funds were on their way. ""They had changed one letter in our email address to respond back to the real estate agent,"" Kelly said. The couple only reported they had been scammed a week later, when the real estate agent called to ask them for the deposit. By then, the money had been transferred to another Australian bank account, and from there to a cryptocurrency exchange, where it was converted to Bitcoin. ""That's where our bank stopped — they said we can't pursue it any further,"" Kelly said. ""We're still waiting for the police — it took them several months to say they’re even looking into it."" The FBI has coordinated several global operations, along with national police agencies like the AFP,  to disrupt BEC schemes. Most of the arrests have been made in the United States and Nigeria. A 2018 report by the cybersecurity company Crowdstrike also pointed to cyber criminals in Nigeria, including the ""formidable criminal organisation"" known as ""Black Axe"". According to the report, Black Axe ""has developed a hierarchical, inter-state organisation while at the same time retaining cult-like tendencies"" and its gangs are ""involved in a multitude of organised crime ventures such as running prostitution rings, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking, grand theft, money laundering, and email fraud/cybercrime."" The report reads: Younger Nigerian criminals — often called Yahoo Boys — are said to begin their scamming careers while undergraduates at university. There are thousands of undergraduates in Nigeria who participate in online fraud, and it has been estimated that there are approximately 5 million online scammers in the Lagos region. Novices typically start off with variations on the classic ""Nigerian prince"" email scam — attempting to lure victims to part with a payment with the promise of a return on this investment at a later date. They then graduate to BEC scams, working either as individuals or within groups, and using malware such as keyloggers to steal passwords and compromise email systems. ""Ransomware tends to be Eastern Europe, Russia, Estonia, areas like that,"" Mr Corbett-Wilkins said. ""BEC scams tend to be more in Africa and parts of continental Asia."" In response to the increase in real estate scams, conveyancers, brokers, and agents are being taught to reduce the risk of payment redirection by, for instance, not sending requests for transfers via email. But industry training isn't enough on its own, Mr Tyler said. ""It’s about trying to educate mums and dads out there in the community,"" he said. The ACCC has the following tips: Mr Corbett-Wilkins has similar advice, and also recommends two-factor authentication for your email account (and your online accounts in general). He added that even if you've been scammed, your bank may be able to claw the money back before it's been transferred out of reach. ""You've got a three-day window where if you act, [there are] high chances you'll get the money back,"" he said. Aside from education, there's another relatively simple measure that would prevent many payment redirection scams. If Kelly's bank had noted a customer was transferring $25,000 to an account number (the scammer's) that did not match the account name (the real estate agent's), it could have blocked the transfer. Banks have been dragging their heels on this, Mr Tyler said. ""Banks have to start verifying the account name versus account number,"" he said. ""If we have robust identification of a person when they're opening an account, then you can verify against that."" The ACCC has recommended account name verification to the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC). In February 2020, it wrote to ASIC recommending it examine the verification model that would be rolled out in the UK the following month: Where other jurisdictions make it more difficult for scammers, Australian consumers and businesses are at increased risk of being key targets for scammers. The banks have argued against such a system, saying that greater scrutiny of account names would end up blocking legitimate transactions. There are no signs that Australia will follow the UK's lead anytime soon. ASIC's current review of the ePayments code, a voluntary code of practice for the banks, does not include the prospect of name verification for scam prevention. Back in Western Australia, Kelly and her husband have forked out another $25,000 to buy the original house. ""We do love it, but it's definitely ruined the house a little for us,"" she said. ""It's a bit tainted by that experience."" They're considering legal action against the real estate agent if police are unable to recover the money. ""The blame is ultimately on the scammers, but the agent runs a business and should have that kind of security,"" Kelly said. ""They'd probably been hacked for months and the hackers had been waiting. ""It was creepy and smart at the same time."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

122,This is pure dingo Sandy Maliki. She's just helped answer a key question: Is she descended from wolves or dogs? ,science," ABC Rural Researchers say dingo genetic breakthrough sheds light on controversial lineage Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Researchers are claiming a major breakthrough in cracking the genetic code of an iconic Australian animal that has been the source of controversy for years. The international consortium of researchers has been looking at the genomic sequence of the pure Australian desert dingo to determine whether it is closer to wolves or dogs and to provide clarity around the hotly debated question of whether dingoes are the same as feral wild dogs. The study, published today in Science Advances, found the answer lies somewhere in between and pure dingoes are an ""intermediary"" between wolves and domestic dog breeds. ""What the study showed was that it really is an early offshoot of modern breed dogs, [but] it's separate from them and it really sits off the branch from the ancestor wolf,"" Associate Professor Matthew Field from James Cook University said. ""We domesticated dogs — and it's hotly debated — somewhere between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago, is the latest estimate, and dingoes essentially arrived in Australia about 5,000 to 8,000 years ago. ""It really lived in isolation until about 200 years ago, when breed dogs were brought back to Australia, and what our study shows is that they really did adapt to the environment in Australia, they are unique to this ecosystem and sort of unique to the evolution of dogs as well."" The five-year study was led by La Trobe University and involved researchers from across the world, including Australia, Denmark, Norway, Germany, the US and England. The pure desert dingo that was the source of the study, Sandy Malaki, was found on a roadside in the central Australian desert near the Strzlecki Track when she was three weeks old. Researchers said the full sequencing of Sandy Malaki's genome found key differences between dingoes and dogs that affect what they eat. ""A pure dingo has only one copy of the amylase gene, whereas domestic dogs have multiple copies, which influences the gut microbiome and, we predict, affects what dingoes eat,"" senior author Bill Ballard from La Trobe University said. ""Based on this new knowledge, we hypothesise that dingoes are far less likely to eat farm animals, including sheep. ""If we're correct, what farmers currently assume are dingoes killing their stock, are likely to be feral wild dogs."" The role of dingoes in maintaining balance in Australia's ecosystem is widely debated. ""Dingoes are Australia's 'top order predator', meaning they influence everything in their environment,"" Professor Ballard said. ""If dingoes aren't given the protection they deserve, it will upset the country's ecological balance – potentially leading to environmental issues like erosion and species extinction.""

123,"John Russell, last surviving member of original Mawson Station Antarctica team, dies aged 101",science,"  Antarctica's 1954 Mawson Station team final surviving member John Russell dies aged 101 Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The last living member of the 10-man team that built Australia's Mawson Station in 1954 has passed away in Brisbane, aged 101. A legend of Australia's Antarctic exploration history, John Russell sailed to the icy southern waters on the MV Kista Dan to construct the first permanent structures that became Mawson Station 68 years ago. Located about 5,200km south-west of Perth, Mawson Station is the longest continually operating facility south of the Antarctic Circle. As a young English diesel fitter and engineer fascinated with the ice-floes and wintry weather of the far south, Mr Russell came to Australia hoping to join the country's growing involvement in Antarctica. ""I came here in 1938 to join an Antarctic expedition, because I had decided when I was 10 years of age that that was what I was going to do,"" he told ABC Radio Brisbane in February last year. World War II, however, put Mr Russell's dreams on hold. He enlisted to fight for his adopted homeland of Australia but was later discharged after weeks of serious illness in Alice Springs. Fully recovered, and with his original division already overseas, Mr Russell signed up to relieve the crew of British troop carrier Aquitana, spending weeks working in the ship's engine room. After his maritime career ended, Mr Russell returned to Australia and joined the civilian construction group sent to rebuild a shattered Darwin after the bombing in 1942. It was known as the Darwin Overland Mobile Force. But as Australia slowly recovered from war and turned its attention once more to the south, his Antarctic dream remained very much alive. Sir Douglas Mawson had been championing for an Australian commitment to invest in Antarctica and, in 1947, the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) was launched Mr Russell's opportunity came when he was appointed engineer for ANARE and a telegram summoned him to Melbourne. Mr Russell travelled to Macquarie Island in the winter of 1949, Heard Island in 1952, and then began work on the project to build Mawson Station in 1953. His role was challenging — modifying equipment and machinery so the team could work in Antarctica's freezing conditions. Working in Melbourne, the team sourced and developed pre-fabricated buildings that could be quickly put together on-site to form what would become Mawson Station. The team set sail on the MV Kista Dan in 1953 and by February 1954 arrived in Horseshoe Bay. ""The only place we could find which looked possible from aerial photographs for this particular base, [was] with a fairly narrow entrance into [Horseshoe Bay],' Mr Russell told the ABC last year. ""Around the bay were little bare-nosed rocks sticking out, and one big rock shelving down from the ice. ""The plateau ice flowed each side of this rock down into the sea. ""That's where we built the base and it's still there today."" He said the team had to work fast, with the ship staying put for 10 days, by which time they had built the kitchen, living area and two store huts. By the end of 1954, after months of work, the 10 men had built a living quarters, works hut, engine shed, store huts and a carpenter's shop. Biscoe Hut, the eight square metre original living and sleeping quarters Mr Russell's team built, still stands today. After the Mawson Station expedition concluded, Mr Russell returned to Antarctica in 1958 with Americans at McMurdo Station —  his last trip south before settling into married life with his wife Joan and daughter Sue. Through his long and varied career, he worked for BP, ran a banana plantation, and lived in Singapore before eventually settling in Brisbane. Mr Russell outlived all of his 1954 Mawson Station expedition peers and later collaborated on a book about his experiences. In January, shortly before moving into respite care from his Deception Bay home of many years, Mr Russell donated to the ANARE club his collection of journals, papers, photos and technical drawings, which dated back to 1948. His daughter, Sue, said Mr Russell passed away peacefully on Monday night — two months shy of his 102nd birthday. As per his wishes, his body has been donated to science, after living a ""full and remarkable life"". Mr Russell is survived by his daughter Sue, his two stepsons Douglas and wife Chris, and David and his partner, Sue's husband Keith, six grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.

124,Shark filmed in drumline tangle reveals 'archaic and ineffective' control program in Queensland,science,"  Shark filmed in struggle with Qld drumline lures fresh criticism of control program Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Footage of a shark caught by a drumline at Sunrise Beach in Queensland has left the state government having to defend its control program yet again. The footage, which was taken earlier this week and has been shared extensively online, shows the shark thrashing about in the water, just metres from the Noosa Shire shoreline. The Envoy Foundation, a vocal critic of Queensland's control program, is one of several marine conservation groups outraged by the images. The foundation's Andre Borell described the footage as ""shocking"". ""It so, so visually shows just how archaic and ineffective drumlines are,"" he said. ""They catch and kill sharks indiscriminately [and] stressed sharks attract more larger sharks to predate, plus they routinely come loose and wash into the surf zone, which creates an entanglement and drowning risk."" He said drumlines washed up at Woorim beach last week, and on the Sunshine Coast during January. ""It's madness that this is how we protect our beaches,"" Mr Borell said. The Queensland government has been fending off repeated criticism of its shark control program since it was launched in 1962. Figures obtained from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) show more than 13,000 sharks have been captured by nets and drumlines across Queensland since 2001. There were 785 caught last year, with another 258 this year. More than 900 turtles were captured in the same period. DAF said a contractor was sent to Sunrise Beach after receiving a report about the shark in question. ""The shark was not observed in area and the drumline was replaced,"" the spokesperson said. They said the government ""always put human life and human safety first"" and would not make any changes to its shark control program until better alternatives were found. ""The government has committed to research trialling new shark mitigation technologies, such as catch-alert drum lines in central Queensland,"" the spokesperson said. ""Since the shark control programs started in 1962, there have only been two shark fatalities at Queensland beaches where shark control equipment was in place.""

125,"What actually is toe jam, and how serious a problem is it?",science,"  What actually is toe jam, and how serious a problem is it? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Toe jam can be a source of fascination, disgust or barely noticed. It can be a sign you need to wash your feet or rethink your choice of footwear. It can also lead to major health issues. Toe jam, the gunk and debris between your toes, has even made it to a Beatles song. But it was unlikely John Lennon was thinking about foot hygiene when he wrote the lyrics to the second verse of Come Together: He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola He say, ‘I know you, you know me' One thing I can tell you is you got to be free. Toe jam isn't a medical term. There is no formal medical term to describe the dead skin cells, sweat, sock lint and dirt that combine in the small and often cramped spaces between our toes. Toe jam can have the consistency of soft cheese or cake crumbs. It can smell or be odourless. And its colour can range from white to grey-brown. You're more likely to create toe jam if you wear closed-in shoes when it's hot, or gumboots that don't allow sweat to evaporate. Poor foot hygiene will certainly make it more likely you'll develop toe jam. That's because sweaty debris accumulates in between the toes if you don't pay attention to cleaning these areas in the shower or bath. Toe jam may also be more likely if your feet sweat a lot for other reasons. For instance, we know sweaty feet can be a problem for children and adolescents, who have more active sweat glands. And some people have a serious medical condition called hyperhidrosis, where they sweat excessively. The collection of sweat and dead skin between toes provides bacteria living naturally on our skin the chance to thrive. These bacteria, which include ones in the genus Brevibacterium, feed on sweat, releasing molecules that give the characteristic ""cheesy"" smell of sweaty feet. Brevibacterium is also used to ripen some cheeses. This warm and damp environment is also a perfect site for tinea pedis, a fungal skin infection you might know as athlete's foot. Signs of tinea might be soggy white skin between your toes, which can be itchy, and red areas, a sign of skin damage. Damaged skin between toes might develop small fluid-filled blisters and may also bleed if the weak skin is torn. So while toe jam isn't the same as tinea, it might provide the perfect conditions for the fungus to grow. Generally, toe jam is a minor health problem. You can manage it with good foot hygiene. And if you develop tinea, you can use a short course of an anti-fungal treatment you can buy from a pharmacy (see below). It is quite a different prospect, however, for a person living with a chronic disease such as diabetes, someone who has poor vision (so can't see toe jam or its complications developing), or who may be unable to reach their feet due to limited mobility. Diabetes not well controlled with diet and exercise, or drugs, increases the risk of a person having reduced blood flow (peripheral arterial disease) and reduced feeling in their feet (sensory neuropathy). Broken skin between the toes caused by tinea can become infected rapidly, increasing the risk of: infection spreading to the foot and leg (cellulitis) infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) gangrene (dead tissue caused by lack of blood flow) amputation of a toe, part of the foot or leg. So early identification of tinea in a vulnerable person is especially important to prevent complications. Here are our four tips to avoid problems with toe jam, including developing tinea and its complications: Wash the spaces between your toes and dry them carefully after a shower or bath, and after swimming. Gyms and swimming pools are a common place to pick up a fungal infection on your feet so it's a good idea to wear thongs to reduce the risk of tinea If possible, avoid wearing footwear that doesn't allow sweat to evaporate (such as closed-in shoes made of synthetic material and gumboots). Going barefoot, when there is no risk of injury, will also allow sweat to evaporate Treat sweaty feet by using an anti-perspirant containing aluminium chloride. More severe cases of hyperhidrosis may be managed using drugs, such as Botox injections to the feet. Fungal infections (tinea) should be treated using over-the-counter antifungal creams such a terbinafine or clotrimazole. Resistant infections might require a course of prescribed antifungal medicines Pay attention to signs indicating an infection is spreading from the foot. These could be pain and swelling in the toes, or red streaks along the foot and up the leg. This requires an urgent visit to a podiatrist or doctor. Lennon mentions a ""walrus gumboot"" in verse three of Come Together. The final line of verse two says ""you got to be free"". The cover of The Beatles album Abbey Road shows Paul McCartney walking barefoot (second from the left). Maybe the Beatles did know a thing or two about toe jam and foot health.

126,"Giant turtle saved from NSW shark net, as sixth dead turtle washes ashore ",science,"  Sixth leatherback turtle found dead, another entangled in shark net, on NSW Central Coast Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The death toll of the world's largest sea turtles continues to climb on the NSW Central Coast, with a sixth leatherback washing ashore and another found entangled in a shark net this week. A sixth leatherback turtle has washed up on a NSW Central Coast beach within about a month A leatherback was also caught in a shark net off the Central Coast this week but was able to be saved Authorities have said recent storms could be to blame as investigations into the turtle deaths continue WARNING: This article contains images some readers may find distressing. The latest leatherback was found at Forresters Beach on Wednesday. It was removed for investigation and sampling. It is the sixth leatherback to be found dead on a Central Coast beach within about a month, according to NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). NPWS said between March 18 and April 10, five turtles were found on Little, North Shelly, Avoca and Birdie Beaches. The founder of Australian Seabird and Turtle Rescue Central Coast, Cathy Gilmore, said it was alarming. ""This is just unprecedented,"" she said. ""It's really a mystery as to what's going on."" An NPWS spokesperson said the deaths were under investigation by the Australian Registry of Wildlife Health and the Australian Museum. NPWS has previously said warm sea temperatures and recent storms may have played a part in the turtles' deaths. University of Newcastle's marine ecologist Vincent Raoult agreed. ""We've had some unusually warm waters coming down as a result of climate change and the strengthening of the East Australian Current in addition to these really big storms,"" Dr Raoult said. He said storms could confuse marine life where they could drift into places they did not usually swim or that had lots of plastics. ""It can be that they've ended up in waters that they're unfamiliar with that are too cold and gotten disoriented,"" Dr Raoult said. On Wednesday morning, a turtle was also caught in a shark net at Macmasters Beach. The Department of Primary Industries said the 1.8-metre-long turtle was entangled for just under two hours before it was released and swam off. Ms Gilmore said she would not be surprised if some of the deaths were caused by entanglements. ""The leatherback turtle at Forresters Beach did seem to be dead for some time, so we do not believe it was the same turtle,"" she said. ""We need to stay alert now. ""We would prefer a turtle come into care, but this is a leatherback and we don't have the facilities for a huge turtle like that.""

127,Pet sitting businesses are booming. Here's what you need to know before leaving your furry friend with one,science,"  Pet sitting services are booming. Here's what you need to know before booking one Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As pandemic restrictions ease and humans return to work, furry family members added to households over the past two years are sending demand for pet sitting and doggy day care services soaring. Animal Care Australia president Michael Donnelly said pet sitting was a more attractive option for owners than traditional kennels and catteries. ""There are a couple of factors attributing to the rise in demand for pet care and one of those is there are more of us with pets on a whole,"" he said. ""Kennels and catteries are still functioning and the price is comparable to pet sitting services — so if you're owner looking at dog sitting in a kennel or do sitting at home, when it comes to prices you're going to prefer to keep your pet at home. ""The only difference is that catteries and kennels are regulated and pet sitters are not. ""While it might appear great for your animal to be at home, [you need to seek] out references and find out how much experience they have and whether they have knowledge of local laws in the areas and can comply with the appropriate animal welfare acts."" Mr Donnelly said the boom in pet sitting businesses, many of which were advertised on social media, ""was relatively new space"". He said his organisation was reviewing the national animal welfare act and would ""keep an eye on pet sitting businesses"". First Class Pet Sitting Services owner Kylie Moore said in the past few weeks her business had ""gone crazy"". COVID-19 fuels a rise in unusual pets as people spend more time at home. ""We're under the pump and need more pet sitters,"" she said. ""We've seen an increase in doggy day care and care during work hours. ""People have spent a lot of time at home during COVID and either dog's never been left alone before or got so used [to the company] … they've developed separation anxiety. ""Everyone had the time and the money because they weren't going anywhere, but unfortunately, long term, it's created a little hidden monster. ""If you haven't had a dog before, you wouldn't be aware of what's needed, and there are some certain breeds that are more prone to anxiety."" Ms Moore said many sitters signed up because they wanted work flexibility, while for veterinary nurses or others in the animal industry it was ""extra pocket money"". ""Rather than going back to a nine-to-five job, they can do as much work as they can in an area they like,"" she said. ""Pets are less stressful than office jobs and it's a bit more rewarding."" Mad Paws co-founder and chief executive Justus Hammer says many people feel ""much more comfortable leaving their animal with another pet-loving sitter than a kennel they don't know"". ""During COVID individuals became accustomed to having more freedom and flexibility over their workday,"" he said. ""We've seen a lot of people become pet sitters because they have more time at home and more control over their schedule. ""Our platform has a unique rating system that allows pet owners to select a pet sitter based on their specific needs — for example, if you have an anxious dog, we have sitters that specialise in this."" Albany Creek teacher aide Zsuzsi Varga has run pet sitting services in the past and saw an opportunity to earn some extra money so she could visit family overseas later this year. The Easter break booked out within days in late March and her business, Suzie's Pet Care, already has bookings for the June and September school holidays. Ms Varga said it was important to meet the animal she would care for numerous times before the owners left. ""I decide what owners to work with by asking questions and seeing how well they know their animals,"" she said. ""I was always taught animals know and feel you. ""It's important to bond, as it develops a relationship between the sitter and the pet you are looking after — it makes them feel safe and also you."" RSPCA Queensland spokeswoman Emma Lagoon said the organisation had not charted a big rise in pet sitting services, but stressed that the onus was ""very much on people to research and read reviews and use word-of-mouth referrals"". If your pooch is prone to storm anxiety is there anything you can do? The RSPCA has partnered with online pet sitting business PetCloud, but Ms Lagoon said most sitters were ""pretty good"". ""Make sure you have that trust with the person,"" she said. ""It's a matter of seeing other's people experiences with them."" Ms Lagoon said the RSPCA also offered a service where owners could leave their details and those of their pet sitters so they could be contacted if the animal ran away or got lost. Ms Moore recommended owners only choose sitters or care providers with insurance, had experience in the animal industry and held qualifications or an animal first aid certificate. ""Then I'd be looking for references, whether that's Google or Facebook reviews, or from previous clients,"" she said. ""If your pet is going to stay at someone's home, definitely do a meet-and-greet at a pet sitter's home so the animal can sniff around and you can get a gauge on where they'll be living."" Australia is full of weird plants and animals. And Dr Ann Jones is on speaking terms with most of them! The ACA was particularly interested in backing doggy day care businesses, especially for pets living in apartments or townhouses, Mr Donnelly said. ""It is a personal choice, how much you're willing to leave your fur child in the care of someone you don't know,"" he said. ""But where there are multiple states who are making workers go back to the office, we are considering pets in strata which need someone to look after them while mum and dad are at work. ""If that could be rebated or supported by local governments, we would certainly support that.""

128,Greg knew there was a better use for some of his farmland. Now his conservation is paying off,science,"  Save our species: The farmers who combine agriculture with conservation and reap the benefits Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog More and more farmers are choosing to combine conservation with agriculture and the benefits are paying off. Helen Huggins is back on the once mighty merino sheep station in the southern Riverina, near the New South Wales-Victoria border, that she used to call home. ""This runs through my blood, this property. All good memories of a lovely and happy childhood."" She and her brothers used to ride horses through the paddocks of Savernake Station, touching the tops of the saplings. The four-part Shifting Cultures series explores respect for country, ancient knowledge and the way new technologies are changing our relationship to nature. ""We just used to go flat out through all these trees like you do when you're young. I was a bit like a tomboy. I just went into nature, and I'd ride my pony and take in all this."" ""But things have changed. The trees have gotten bigger. You could bend some of them over [then] but you wouldn't be doing that now,"" she says. Other things have changed too. Huggins is one of a growing number of Australian farmers opting to combine conservation with agriculture, and dedicating a portion of their land to save Australia's threatened biodiversity. Savernake Station is renowned for its pastoral history, but also for its large white cypress pines and other old trees. These provide habitat for about 80 species of birds, including vulnerable species such as the diamond firetail and dusky wood swallow. The woodland survives because previous generations of her family, the Sloane family, fenced off part of the property in the early 1900s. They appreciated the bushland and understood that the sandy soils of this section of the property made it less suitable for grazing. ""We wouldn't have had any sheep or cattle here for over 100 years. So [we're grateful for] the foresight of my previous generations to have locked this area up. ""They were conservationists before their time, especially my father, who put into all his children that we looked after the country and the country looked after you,"" Huggins says. She took his words to heart. In 2018, she signed a conservation agreement with the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Trust to protect her portion of Savernake Station. She has registered the protection of 355 hectares on the property's title, setting the arrangement in place forever. The agreement with the trust requires the land be preserved as woodland, and weeds and feral animals like rabbits and foxes must be controlled. In return, Huggins receives an annual indexed payment. Her current home, Woodpark, is 90 kilometres away from Savernake Station. In 2018, she and husband Owen introduced a similar, in-perpetuity arrangement on their merino stud. They've fenced off a quarter of their 7,600-hectare property for conservation and the results are impressive. Saltbush, butterbush, boree trees and river red gums are regenerating, and the calls of the critically endangered plains-wanderer have been heard on Woodpark. A devastating bushfire in January 1987 marked a turning point for the couple and their approach to farming on the property. ""A lot of the stock were removed. We had no real rain till June that year. As late as May, there was still clouds of black, swirling dust and loose sand. Rain eventually came and what we began to see was how the land could recover if we let it,"" Owen Huggins says. After thinking deeply about how a conservation agreement and lower stock numbers may impact the income and land value of Woodpark, they agreed that the benefits outweighed any reservations. The environmental benefits have flow-on effects — the merino wool produced on Woodpark has just been given sustainable certification by New Zealand Merino and will be sold into the premium market. They also receive a premium price for their beef cattle. The ANU's Professor David Lindenmayer is a leading expert on forest ecology and conservation science. He supports paying farmers who are willing to protect habitat on their property, provided there's strong monitoring and transparency about what's happening on the ground. ""Approximately 55 per cent of Australia's land mass is private land that's used for agriculture and grazing. Those areas have enormous opportunities to restore the vegetation cover in part [and] better balance agricultural production [with] biodiversity,"" he says. There are also opportunities for carbon capture and storage, he adds. Professor Lindenmayer cites Australia's stark record on biodiversity loss as a reason for trying new approaches. There have been 34 mammal extinctions since colonisation and there are big declines in frogs and reptiles. One in six Australian birds are now threatened. ""And beyond that, some species are occupying only a tiny part of their former range, like the greater bilby which once lived across vast areas of Australia,"" he says. Recent research led by a University of Queensland team has found that 48 per cent of Australia's threatened species' distributions occur on private freehold land – and that conservation on farmland is critical to threatened species' recovery. Professor Lindenmayer says it's paradoxical that there is so much emphasis on putting trees and shrubs back into the landscape, while legislation still allows large amounts of land clearing, especially in New South Wales and Queensland. ""Most people don't realize that there's still an enormous amount of land clearing going on in Australia. Land clearing directly removes habitat [and] animals can't survive without access to habitat."" Improving and protecting habitat on privately owned land in Australia's farming districts is essential and he says there are increasing benefits for farmers. ""There's an understanding that the loss of biodiversity is as equally serious as rapid changes in climate and that they go together. ""People are starting to talk about what we call nature-based solutions to the climate problem that have co-benefits. That's conserving biodiversity, storing more carbon, reducing carbon emissions. So these things go hand-in-glove,"" he says. Brendan Fletcher frowns as he checks the weed growth in the paddocks of Thornhill Station. Fletcher is an Indigenous ranger for the Gidarjil Development Corporation in Southern Queensland. The Indigenous group owns three former cattle stations all about an hour's drive inland from Bundaberg, near Gin Gin and Bulburin National Park. All three properties have been returned to the traditional owners, the Meeroni people. But the upfront costs of revegetation are a major barrier to restoring land, says Gidargil's business development manager Angela Huston. So Gidarjil is taking part in the pilot of an agricultural stewardship scheme that opens new revenue sources for farmers interested in conservation. The stewardship scheme, designed in part by Professor Lindenmayer and his ANU colleague Professor Andrew Macintosh, includes a carbon and biodiversity pilot program. And under the pilot program, Gidarjil received an upfront payment of just over $200,000 from the federal government to revegetate part of one of their properties, Thornhill Station. This funding, along with income from other sources, has allowed them to remove cattle from the properties and the group no longer needs to rely on revenue from cattle agistment. “The vision now is to continue to restore the open paddocks to forest,” Huston says. Fletcher, who is also a traditional owner, will do a cool winter burn on Thornhill Station to get rid of weeds and prepare the small but significant site for tree planting. Because each project in the pilot is registered under Australia's Emissions Reduction Fund, the trees will earn Gidarjil carbon credits. These should increase as the trees grow. Carbon credits are units representing carbon reduction that are bought and sold like stocks. Companies like airlines buy them to offset their carbon footprint. The ANU's Professor Andrew Macintosh, who recently exposed the rorts in Australia's carbon market, says the Gidarjil project is best practice – it's how carbon farming should work. ""[The tree planting] is likely to generate positive benefits for biodiversity because the plantings must be established and managed in accordance with biodiversity planting protocols,"" Macintosh says. Huston says the opportunity to earn money from carbon farming and habitat creation shifts the dial for Indigenous landholders. ""It changes dramatically. It allows our people to be on country doing what we do best, looking after country, making it healthier. That in itself is a reward. ""But to be able to gain an ongoing revenue stream from that is important, it means that there's less reliance on any government funding."" Fletcher can't wait to start planting out a diverse range of species to create extra habitat for locally threatened species such as the long-nosed potoroo and the silver-headed antechinus. He'll also continue working to control feral pigs. ""I love getting up in the morning coming to work. It is what I do. It's my drive, it's my passion to manage country."" Greg Rummery farms dryland crops on the flat, clay floodplains of the Namoi River near Walgett in north-western NSW. His 1,000-hectare farm is small by local standards, but in 2019 he decided to retain about a quarter of his property for conservation. The fenced-off area forms a corridor of green along the banks of the river, with a mix of older trees and newer regrowth. The river red gums and coolabah trees still bear the high-water marks from the 2021 floods. Rummery says a common practice in his district would be to farm crops like wheat or lentils on the flat floodplain and run beef cattle along the river, providing farmers with two sources of income. ""But rather than trying to generate a dollar out of that by running stock in there and having them graze down to the waterline on the river and using the river as the boundary, I thought there's got to be a better way."" When the Biodiversity Conservation Trust called for expressions of interest from landholders in the Walgett district in 2018, Rummery says it struck a chord. ""Maybe there's a better use for [that land] than trying to farm it or trying to flog it with stock. You know, that's the bit that needs incentivising,"" he says. Rummery's annual payment of just over $20,000 requires him to allow regrowth to continue, control weeds and keep on top of fox and wild pig numbers. The agreement runs for 15 years. After extreme drought conditions between 2013-15 and again from 2017-19, Rummery says the benefits of diversifying income became clear. Meet the farmers like Helen, Greg, Brendan and Angela who are setting aside a portion of their land for conservation. ""Effectively, in those drought years, we didn't have any farm income. So the income from the biodiversity agreement was valuable. It's only a small contribution, though."" The idea is catching on, Rummery says. He also works as a consultant agronomist and he has helped six other landholders sign similar conservation deals. ""It was a bit left field when I first signed up. There was a bit of scepticism. Let's move beyond that. And let's encourage all private landholders to look at their landholding and go, 'You know what, that bit down there is interesting or important.'"" ""It's putting a dollar value on conservation. It's saying conservation is a real land use."" There's a new focus on the role of private land conservation — the federal Threatened Species Strategy Action Plan for 2021-26 promotes working with land managers and includes targets such as increasing the area managed for conservation by 50 million hectares. And key players in the on-the-ground conservation sector, including Bush Heritage, Landcare and Australian Wildlife Conservancy, have recently formed the Australian Land Conservation Alliance. One of the Alliance's aims is to encourage commercial models that fund conservation and land restoration. Whether these goals will be enough to stop ongoing habitat loss and Australia's growing list of threatened and endangered species remains to be seen. But their future hangs in the balance.

129,Scientists thought they had some pretty ordinary spider fossils. Then they put them under UV light,science," Science Spider fossils from 22 million years ago may have been preserved by sulphur secreted by algae Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Gloopy goo that fatally snared spiders more than 22 million years ago may have also helped preserve them in exquisite detail. Researchers from the US and UK suspect sticky sulphurous secretions from algae hardened the brittle exoskeletons of the spiders and staved off decay, allowing them to fossilise. The study, published today in Communications Earth & Environment, might also help direct palaeontologists to uncover more of these rare, delicate fossils, and get a better picture of ancient environments. For Alison Olcott, a chemical palaeontologist at the University of Kansas and lead author of the study, the first hint that algae might be involved came when she and her colleague Matthew Downen discovered the fossils glowed. In daylight, the spider fossils have a recognisable outline, but don't look too dissimilar from the rock they're embedded in. But under a microscope that threw UV light on the fossils, the spiders lit up in crisp detail. ""All these amazing details, like little hairs … on the spiders were all of a sudden visible,"" Dr Olcott said. ""It was really exciting just how much more we could see, and we got very interested in what the chemistry of these fossils was that made them glow."" The spiders were originally found sandwiched between layers of sedimentary rock from Aix-en-Provence in the south of France, at a site discovered in the late 1700s. Some 22.5 million years ago, the area hosted a lake or brackish lagoon, and it has yielded a wealth of fossils of organisms that lived in or near water, including insects, shrimp and, of course, spiders. And it's these remains of softer, squishier animals that put Aix-en-Provence on the palaeontological map. A tiny arachnid discovered in 100-million-year-old amber fills a critical gap between today's spiders and spider-like arachnids that lived before dinosaurs. Spider exoskeletons — their crispy outer layer — decay much faster than, say, bones, shells and teeth, which are composed of hard, mineralised material. ""And with fossilisation, it's always a race against decay,"" Dr Olcott said. But no-one had teased out exactly why the Aix-en-Provence site managed to preserve so many ancient soft-bodied animals so well. To find out, Dr Olcott and her colleagues borrowed eight fossil spiders from the French National Museum of Natural History. They made ""elemental maps"" showing the chemical make-up of different parts of the fossils. Then they matched the chemical elements to different colours thrown off by the fossils when illuminated with UV light. The dark brown remains of the spiders' abdomens glowed orange under UV light, and were made mostly of carbon and sulphur. Carbon was expected. Spider exoskeletons are made from chitin, and chitin has lots of carbon, but no sulphur. So where did the sulphur come from? A clue to the sulphur source came from the thousands of tiny, needle-like fossils embedded in the rock surrounding the spiders. These, the researchers suspected, were diatoms: single-celled algae that live in capsules made of glass. Some diatoms exude gluey sulphur-rich substances, which help them clump together to create ""diatom mats"" that bloom on the water's surface. So what Dr Olcott thought happened was an unfortunate spider wandered onto a diatom mat, got stuck, and was quickly encased by the sticky goo. This formed a barrier that stopped oxygen from getting through to the corpse, and thwarted many microbes that would usually decompose it. Sulphur in the diatom gloop also reacted with the chitin exoskeleton. Chitin is made up of long chains that contain carbon. Should sulphur find its way in the mix, it links carbon atoms in neighbouring chitin chains. This ""bridging"" would have bestowed extra strength to the chitin, Dr Olcott said. ""If this sulphurisation can happen on an hours-to-days scale, it really gives these soft-bodied organisms a fighting chance to be fossilised."" (Sulphur-bridging is commonly used today to harden rubbers, to make car tyres and the like, in the process known as vulcanisation.) Eventually, the diatom mat sank to the bottom of the lake, where sediments covered the algae, along with the unfortunate creatures stuck on it. And over the aeons, those sediments hardened and locked the fossils inside until they were brought to light once again in the 18th century. Australian Museum and UNSW palaeontologist Matthew McCurry, who was not involved in the study, says the new research gets us closer to understanding what conditions are needed to fossilise more delicate species. ""The [fossil] record of spiders is really quite dismal across the whole world. ""They're small, fragile organisms, they don't turn into fossils very easily, so you need these really specific geochemical conditions to aid in their formation."" When Nigel McGrath hit heavy rock while ploughing a field, little did he realise he was sowing the seeds of a discovery some 15 million years in the making. Knowing how spiders could be preserved might help palaeontologists uncover more similarly fragile fossils by narrowing their search to fossilised diatom mats, called diatomites, Dr Olcott said. ""So rather than just looking through all the rocks [at a site], you might first see what's in the diatomites."" Dr McCurry was wary of extrapolating the results of the new study to sites elsewhere. ""The work they've done on the fossils from that one province is great — they've associated the [diatom] microfossils and the specific [fossilisation] pathway for those fossil spiders. ""But they haven't yet done any chemical analyses on fossils from around the world. ""And so that's really the next step — to take that hypothesis that they've put forward in this paper, and see if that really does hold true across the rest of the world.""

130,The curious case of a shark sighting in a suburban Darwin lake,science,"  NT Fisheries solves the mystery of suburban Darwin shark sighting Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog For nearly two weeks, locals have been on tenterhooks. Could there really be a shark in Lake Alexander? The popular suburban swimming area in Darwin's East Point has been closed to the public since a shark was reportedly sighted earlier this month. ""Until we know the answer, we won't be risking public safety,"" a City of Darwin spokesperson said at the time. Word spread through the city, with locals wondering how a shark could have possibly ended up there. Now, the Top End mystery has been solved, revealing the elusive intruder's true identity. ""They got a bit of a result last night, it wasn't a shark, but it was a result,"" Darwin council's parks and reserves manager Jamie Lewis said. ""They caught two barramundis ... but they also caught a very large milkfish."" NT Fisheries said the milkfish was more than one metre long, while the barramundi were 85 and 45 centimetres in length. The theory is that the milkfish was actually seen two weeks ago with its fin precariously sticking out of the water, Mr Lewis said. ""A milkfish is a very large grey-coloured fish with very prominent vertical fins, it would be a very easy fish to mistake for a shark,"" he said. ""We're putting it down to most likely being a case of mistaken identity."" Mr Lewis said council has spent about 50 hours line fishing the lake over the last two weeks to try catch it, and even had one of their lines broken. He has a theory for that too. ""What we're thinking, maybe the barra's eaten the bait and broken the line off in an underwater snag."" While the believed culprit has been snagged, Mr Lewis said they still have not been able to 100 per cent confirm there wasn't shark. ""But we've been as diligent as possible and I think it's a safe assumption now that we're looking at milkfish"", he said. The council is confident the case of the Lake Alexander shark sighting is now closed, and the lake was finally reopened. As for how the fish got there in the first place, Mr Lewis believes they would have been put there. ""Our screens don't even let sand through in our pumping system,"" he said. ""So it's certainly not going to let a metre plus fish swim through, so it's been put in the lake."" Mr Lewis said they very much preferred people did not place their fish in the lake in future. ""It's not ideal, it puts us in a bit of our position where we have to do something about it,"" he said. NT Fisheries will conduct a final sweep of the lake on Thursday night.

131,'This place is alive and thriving': Orca ecotype spotted off WA coast,science,"  Orca ecotype spotted at Bremer Bay off WA coast for first time Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Marine experts have been left stunned after an ecotype of killer whale was spotted off Western Australia's south coast for the first time. The pod of about 120 orcas was seen swimming in the Bremer Bay canyon over the past few days. Marine biologist Pia Markovic said the pod was likely to be the type C or Ross Sea ecotype of orca from cooler waters on the eastern side of Antarctica. She said the whales were slightly greyer, smaller in size and sported a different eye patch to those typically seen in the area. Ms Markovic said the ecotype also had a different diet and only ate fish, unlike other orcas, which are known to also hunt whales. She was unsure why the whales had ventured to this part of the world. ""Animals don't really travel for any other reason apart from feeding or for mating,"" she said. ""They [could be] coming up to a warmer water to get rid of bacteria to keep them healthy. ""Just like a visit to the day spa."" Although this was the fist time they had been spotted, Ms Markovic said she had no doubt the pod had been in the area before. Aquatic filmmaker David Riggs said his crew chanced upon the visitors through ""sheer luck"". ""A huge rainstorm went through, we had zero visibility,"" he said. ""Just as it cleared, the skipper noticed a couple of blows. ""It's made us wonder, have we missed them by a whisker in past years?"" Mr Riggs said spotting the whales proved the ocean was healthy. ""This place is alive and thriving,"" he said. ""Sustaining two entirely different populations of killer whales over the course of the whole year — pretty much unheard of."" Mr Riggs said it had been a real journey discovering the Bremer Bay canyon over the years. ""To have this happen adds another layer of interest, it's really spectacular. ""It does make you wonder about the other secrets of the ocean."" ABC Great Southern will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

132,'Faster than an Olympic swimmer': Can drones and creams save beachgoers from the deadliest marine creature?,science,"  Plan for drones to monitor beaches for deadly box jellyfish in North Queensland Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Could the best line of defence against the most deadly marine creature — the box jellyfish — be found hovering in the skies hundreds of metres above swimmers? Mackay Mayor Greg Williamson and jellyfish experts think so and want drones — already used along the Queensland coastline to detect sharks and crocodiles — to be included in the safety plan for protecting swimmers against the deadly threat. The push for drones to be used at Mackay beaches comes after the death of 14-year-old Mark Angelo, who was stung by a box jellyfish at Eimeo Beach in February. Since then, there have been discussions about how to better patrol and monitor beaches to protect swimmers. Dragging nets have long been relied upon, but Cr Williamson said they provided a false sense of security. ""Dragging a beach is only 5 per cent effective in determining whether that beach is safe to swim at or not,"" he said. ""That's why dragging a beach is useless, because stingers can swim at four-knots [7.4 kilometres an hour] and by the time you get out of the water from a drag, they're in."" Cr Williamson said a meeting with Surf Lifesaving Queensland, stinger experts and volunteer lifesavers had committed to setting up a working group and developing practical solutions. ""Time is of the essence, the first thing we need is signage that is eye catching that says if you don't abide by these simple rules [of wearing protective clothing], you might die,"" he said. The drones would use cameras that would feed vision back to operators on the ground who would be able to see if a school of jellyfish was making its way towards beachgoers. As box jellyfish don't hunt in isolation but clusters, they are visible from the air. However, Professor Michael Kingsford from James Cook University, said water quality and weather conditions could pose issues in detecting box jellyfish. ""These guys are often in quite murky water, they're amazingly transparent so they're quite difficult to see,"" he said. ""You need a multifaceted sort of approach … people shouldn't be waiting for the ultimate solution."" Professor Kingsford says work is also being done on a testing kit that would detect jellyfish DNA in the water. ""If you identify part of the DNA that identifies it as a species, you have to make sure that it's very robust and doesn't get confused with other species that are either jellyfish or not. ""We're hoping with this technique that it will be like the RATs that we use for COVID."" In another development aimed at protecting swimmers, trials are underway in Europe to test a topical cream that acts as a repellent against jellyfish. But Professor Kingsford said such creams could also prove problematic. ""The trouble is, it's only as good as the person applying it,"" he said. ""It's like sunscreen … you end up with those patches of red on your body [you] miss. ""The same is true for jellyfish creams. ""I'd have to say, a much more reliable method is a stinger suit, despite not always looking like a fashion icon."" Cr Williamson said commonly held beliefs about the box jellyfish were wrong and played down the threat they posed. It's jellyfish season, so we asked the experts about first-aid myths and what you should do if you or another beach-goer gets stung. ""They're almost predatory and can swim faster than an Olympic swimmer,"" he said. ""They herd their prey into shallow water … they're not just a lump of jelly floating around in the water. ""It's not floating, it's actually hunting."" He said information from stinger expert Dr Jamie Seymour indicated the drones and cameras could provide 90 per cent effectiveness in detecting the jellyfish. Authorities are continuing to urge people to wear protective clothing when swimming at North Queensland beaches. Cr Williamson said he would like to see the drones rolled out at Eimeo and Sarina beaches by next summer.

133,Raising steaks with a lower carbon footprint: Researchers think the answer could be in genetics,science," ABC Rural Armidale researchers hope genetic selection will be key to raising steaks with lower emissions Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Is it possible to breed low-emission cattle and sheep? A group of Australian researchers and industry leaders think so and they are putting $19 million towards making it happen. The University of New England, Armidale (UNE) is collaborating with Angus Australia, Meat and Livestock Australia and the NSW Department of Primary Industry to develop genetics to breed livestock that emits less methane. The project is in line with the beef industry's goal to reach zero carbon emissions by 2030. ""We have always been keen to look at measuring the traits related to methane emissions on our cattle so in the future we can select Angus bulls that will produce lower methane but still be productive,"" Angus Australia's general manager for genetic improvement Christian Duff said. Mr Duff said the organisation's involvement in the project was driven by the consumer. ""There is no doubt there is a trend towards people wanting to be aware of where their product comes from and its impact on the environment. ""The way we can have an impact is by making sure we're recording those methane traits on cattle ... and then in the future having information to select bulls."" UNE researchers are confident that, through the project, they can achieve a steady and permanent reduction in methane emissions from livestock. Two UNE professors will investigate how to improve the genetic make-up of sheep and cattle. Over the next five years, they will measure the methane output of 8,000 cattle and 10,000 sheep living in both feedlot and grazing conditions. The variation between different animals will be analysed and data used to predict which of those animals have genetics that may lower the emissions they produce. Associate Professor Sam Clark will research the beef component, and said both projects could result in a 25 per cent reduction in methane emissions in livestock by 2050. ""A plausible amount to expect from genetic technologies is about 1 per cent methane reduction per year,"" he said. ""The key point about that 1 per cent per year is that, when we use breeding to make that change, it's cumulative and permanent. ""It's a bit like your interest rate for the bank, it just keeps accumulating on top of itself."" The project is scheduled to start later this month.

134,Lyra was being hassled at school for catching bugs and frogs. So her mum emailed Dr Ann Jones,science," Science Why women scientists are rallying around six-year-old bug and frog lover Lyra Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Six-year-old Lyra loves catching frogs in her backyard in summer. ""We have lots of [frogs] in the summer, they have a secret hiding spot at the back of the pond,"" says Lyra, who lives in Ontario, Canada. ""We just put a bucket in and try and scoop up the frogs."" Lyra has loved frogs, bugs and spiders since she was very young, says her mum Julie. ""Lyra's been picking up spiders since she was 11 months old, I can't get her to stop. ""She was just crawling and I stepped into the other room and I came back and she was holding something and giggling up a storm. ""She had a wolf spider crawling all over her."" But when Lyra started coming home from school saying, ""girls shouldn't like catching frogs"" or ""catching bugs is only for boys"", Julie became concerned. ""You can't help think that it's coming from her peers as her teacher is really trying to support her love of science,"" she says. ""I'm a mum in Canada that has very limited people that know about science. ""How do I help a six-year-old?"" So Julie emailed Dr Ann Jones, presenter of ABC Science's What the Duck?! podcast, asking for some encouraging words and inspiration for her young daughter. Dr Jones contacted women scientists around the world to share their stories about their love of bugs, frogs and spiders, and how they broke through barriers and carved out successful careers in science. Here's what they'd like Lyra and other children to know. Jodi Rowley is often knee deep in mud in jungles studying frogs and runs a whole department at the Australian Museum. The amphibian biologist, who grew up in the city, says there's no ""type"" of person who can become a scientist. ""It wasn't instilled in me that I should be outdoors and exploring, but I managed to get there eventually,"" Dr Rowley says. ""I am uncoordinated, I used to climb trees and get stuck. I'm allergic to bees and ants. I'm probably not a natural person to be out in the field."" She wants Lyra to know that she's not alone. ""There are people across the world who are passionate about spiders, snakes, and all types of things … we need more people with passion and care. ""You will find your people and you will find your place, and the world will be better off for it."" Amber Beavis is one of those people who just loves staring at spiders up close. While she now works in science policy in the office of Australia's chief veterinary officer, she says her fascination for spiders won't ever go away after a career working as an academic and spider scientist at the Western Australian Museum. Dr Beavis's mother was a geologist in a typically male field, so she grew up with strong messages about girls going into science, yet she still experienced academic theft and glass ceilings in her career. ""I was a little bit of a 'goth' when I was in my 20s, I had bright pink hair and Doc Martens."" Australia is the land of the fair go and yet we have fewer women in sciences than many developing countries. Dr Beavis said an older male academic told her she didn't ""look how a scientist should look"". She said it was important not to compromise on the need to be herself. ""If folks aren't comfortable with that, then it says more about them than it does about you. "" Dr Beavis said she was incredibly sad to hear Lyra's story. ""Lyra, if you are interested in bugs and creepy crawlies and have that talent for observation, then just get to it. ""Enjoy it, ask questions, and be curious."" Maydianne Andrade also loves spiders. Her lab at the University of Toronto has around 1,500 deadly black widows. That might sound scary, but Dr Andrade says spiders are the least of her worries as a female scientist and woman of colour. ""I did my field research on redback spiders, which are neurotoxic, by myself overnight and people would say 'weren't you terrified?' ""I rode my bike to and from the field site and I was scared of humans. If people drove by then I would hide in the bushes. ""It is a really sad statement that I was in this population of like 100 neurotoxic spiders and what I was afraid of was the people who might not expect to see me in the field."" Dr Andrade says young women are sometimes treated differently to men so they need to stay confident. ""[Being treated differently to men] can erode your self-esteem and your confidence because it often involves questioning you much more than someone else would be questioned; questioning your ideas and not in a good scientific, rigorous way, but in just an 'I don't respect your intellect' way."" Entomologist Tanya Latty loves all sorts of insects and is at home exploring the world and its strange bugs and creatures. She said she'd hoped we'd moved past assumptions around women in science by now. ""I hope that [Lyra] learns that she shouldn't care what people say. ""I'd like [Lyra] to be able to go forward and be who she is, love her tadpoles and not worry about what the rest of the world thinks,"" she says. Dr Latty, who works at the University of Sydney, says she plays up her nerdiness with clipboards and shirts with insects on them so that other people don't think she's doing anything illegal while working in the field. ""When you're a non-white biologist in the field, [you're] very aware that people will see you creeping around and just make assumptions about what you are actually doing there."" Other women from Australia and Canada also wanted to encourage Lyra, and sent in videos. Julie and Lyra joined Dr Jones in an online chat from Canada and shared their excitement about the videos made just for them by scientists from around the world. ""That's just amazing. If this is something she truly does love, then we are going to do what we can to make that happen for her,"" Julie says. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

135,Rural properties increasingly turning to solar as diesel costs soar,science," ABC Rural High diesel prices fuelling rural properties' move to solar Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Starting out as an electrician, Chris Brayley's days were spent fixing air conditioning and refrigeration. In recent years, his company, Brayley Electrical, has shifted to become increasingly focused on solar power, particularly as more customers on rural properties turn away from generators as the cost of diesel continues to rise. Mr Brayley says his decision to help transform properties to off-grid operations is sign of the times. ""We just had to really stay ahead of the game, keep busy, be versatile."" He says there is a 50-50 split for why people switched to solar power. ""Half of them do it because it makes them feel good, and the other half do it for financial reasons."" The desire to save money has increasingly become the main driving force behind the transition, with many farms and stations running off diesel generators. ""With the cost of everything at the moment, if you can reduce things like your diesel bill, which in some places is one of the highest running costs, I think overall it would be way more economical to move away from diesel as much as you can,"" Mr Brayley said. Andreas Helwig, an associate professor of electro-mechanical engineering at the School of Engineering USQ, says rural Australia is in a period of transition when it comes to renewables. ""As the cost of batteries and particularly solar have come down, this is starting to get to the crossover point where rural electricity supplies and connection fees are now coming into balance and there is a choice, particularly on what we call the fringe grid further out west where they can actually supply their own energy on-farm,"" he said. More than 1,000 kilometres north-west of Mr Brayley's Charleville base is Rick Britton's property, Goodwood. Located just outside of Boulia, Mr Britton says the property has been accessing the town's power grid since 1964. In that time, with the addition of air conditioning and more staff quarters, the power bill had grown. ""We're paying about $4,000 a quarter,"" Mr Britton said. It was the prohibitive costs, and issues with a previous contractor, that persuaded the grazier to call Mr Brayley. Now, the equipment has been ordered and a deposit paid for an 80-kilowatt solar set-up. Mr Britton is hopeful Mr Brayley will be at Goodwood this month to install the system and get it up and running. ""I suppose if you talk to my wife, it's probably me outlaying the money that would be the biggest delay,"" Mr Britton said. ""It's a fair financial commitment … I think we've got to a point now where I'm confident with the technology … so we're going to make the investment. ""And the system we're putting in, we won't be getting the $4,000 bill in the mail every quarter."" Looking at the maths of it all, Mr Brayley says bigger properties can burn up to 600 litres of diesel a day, and with fuel prices around $2 a litre, it's ""silly"" not to convert to solar. Despite, or perhaps because of, government inaction, consumers and businesses have flocked towards renewable energy, writes Ian Verrender. ""If you are spending $200,000 or $300,000 a year on diesel to run the homestead, when you can go and spend $500,000 or $600,000 putting off-grid in, then really you've paid it off in three or four, or five years,"" he said. Mr Helwig agrees, citing the increase of fuel prices over the past 18 months as a key motivator for the shift to off-grid options. ""Fuel prices for farming is a very critical driver in the whole energy equation to produce food,"" he said. Mr Britton says it's no surprise more properties are looking to go off-grid. ""They'd be running 24/7. You'd be able to see the dollars going out through the exhaust,"" he said. Mr Helwig says before investing in off-grid solar power, there are three key factors to be aware of. The first is that the capital expenditure renewal is much shorter, which Mr Helwig says you must put funds aside from your savings to prepare for. The second is to design the system for autonomy. ""Instead of having one large inverter, for instance, you can have several smaller ones, acting as slaves so when one inverter fails you don't lose your whole power supply,"" Mr Helwig said. The third is safety, which Mr Helwig stresses is the most important. ""Particularly for the battery energy storage systems. These should have fire control, fire suppression, and also containment so that you don't have any increased risks on the farm.""

136,'We've never seen anything similar before on white dwarfs': Introducing the 'micronova',science," Science New type of cosmic explosion called a 'micronova' discovered by astronomers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Since ancient times, people have witnessed the sudden appearance of bright objects in the sky that can shine for weeks or even months. But now astronomers have found that the same process that causes stellar explosions like some types of supernova can also happen on a much smaller scale. ""We have discovered and identified for the first time what we are calling a micronova,"" said Simone Scaringi, an astronomer at Durham University in the UK. ""What's incredible is that these bursts are very fast; they only last 10 hours to half a day and then are gone,"" said Dr Scaringi, who led the discovery. These fleeting flashes appear to just happen at the poles of some types of magnetised stars, rather than right across the star. Dr Scaringi said the discovery, reported in the journal Nature, challenged our understanding of how thermonuclear explosions happened in some stars. Sudden explosions in the sky were called ""novae"" by 17th century astronomer Tycho Brahe. While novae is Latin for ""new star"", these explosions actually happen on different types of old stars at the end of their life. White dwarfs, the dead core of Sun-like stars that have expended all their hydrogen, are one of the main types of stars involved in stellar explosions. When white dwarf stars, which are about the size of Earth, are close to another star, they suck hydrogen gas off their companion like vampires. The gas builds up on the surface of the white dwarf, causing the star to heat up, triggering a runaway thermonuclear reaction. The hotter it gets, the more hydrogen fusion occurs. If enough gas builds up on the star it reaches a threshold called the Chandrasekhar limit, and ignites and blows up in a cataclysmic process known as a type 1a supernova. If the white dwarf is further away from its companion or it sucks up less gas, the entire shell around the star ignites, but the star itself does not blow up. This event is known as a classic nova. While trawling through data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), Dr Scaringi and his colleagues detected a series of very fast, rapid bursts of energy coming from a white dwarf star. While these bursts were a million times less powerful than novae explosions, they still packed a punch, burning through 20,000 trillion tonnes of material – roughly the equivalent of a hefty asteroid – in just hours. Soon after, the team found another white dwarf in the TESS data doing the same thing, and a third white dwarf was confirmed with observations using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile. ""We've never seen anything similar before on white dwarfs,"" Dr Scaringi said. ""We didn't really expect these thermonuclear explosions to happen locally on the poles. ""We thought before that material would spread around the whole surface, rather than remain confined."" ""It just goes to show … the universe is very dynamic."" In a separate paper accepted for publishing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Dr Scaringi and his team suggest micronovae can happen on white dwarfs that have strong magnetic fields at their poles. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. The magnetic fields funnel material to the poles in columns, stopping the gas from spreading sideways when it hits the surface of the star. ""As material piles up into this column, it gets hotter and hotter and hotter until the column ignites,"" he said. ""That is very new, we never thought that that would actually be a possibility."" It's also possible this phenomenon is very common. ""The conclusion is that maybe these things are quite regular and quite normal if you look at the right systems,"" Dr Scaringi said. ""But they are just so hard to find because you have to be looking at the right time, otherwise you'll just miss it. ""We will be excited to find more of these, we think there should be plenty more."" The new discovery was exciting, commented Brad Tucker, an astronomer at the Australian National University. ""It's cool because, hey, who doesn't like a good explosion?"" said Dr Tucker, who studies supernovae lurking in TESS data. ""If we really want to understand the end stages of stars, we really need to understand the nitty-gritty detail. ""And this [discovery] is very relevant for what I do in the work on a supernova because the mechanism is essentially the same. ""This sort of puts this whole picture together of what happens."" While Dr Tucker said it made sense that there would be smaller explosions like this on white dwarfs, the discovery was only possible because of TESS. NASA's planet-hunting telescope looks at large slabs of sky every 30 minutes and can detect when stars change in brightness. ""The power of TESS is you see these really short time-scale events that are just physically impossible to see from the ground,"" Dr Tucker said. Whether white dwarfs that have micronovae can build up enough mass to become novae, or eventually blow up as supernovas, is still an open question, Dr Scaringi said. ""Who knows what the implications for this [are], but for now, we just wonder about the universe, and appreciate that."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

137,Microplastic prevention 'long overdue' after study finds particles in SA mussels,science,"  Microplastics found in mussels along South Australian beaches, study reveals Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Wild blue mussels in South Australia are eating about three and a half pieces of microplastics – a much larger meal of unwanted waste than researchers initially expected, a study shows. Flinders University has measured the presence of microplastics along South Australia's coastline for the first time Microplastics were found at every beach examined They say wild blue mussels are swallowing microplastic At every beach sampled by Flinders University researchers, microplastic fibres and fragments were found in either the water or the sand including at Ceduna, Coffin Bay, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Robe and Adelaide. It's the first time the presence of microplastics along South Australia's coastline has been measured. Biodiversity and conservation expert Karen Burke da Silva said researchers were surprised to find as much pollution as they did. ""We thought that Coffin Bay would be one of the lowest as it's such a clean area and not a high industry area, but we found a lot of microplastics there – much of it fishing line,"" Professor Burke de Silva said. Researchers found fibres came from people's clothing and fishing line, while fragments came from bigger chunks of plastic floating in the ocean. They believe while the pieces are microscopic in size, microplastics could be taking a toll on the environment, marine life, and potentially humans. ""We eat mussels and a variety of other seafoods, whatever health effects the microplastics are having on the seafood then it'll have a run-on effect to humans,"" Professor Burke da Silva said. She said there was a potential for microplastics to find their way into human food supplies sourced from South Australian waters. ""We know it causes inflammatory responses in mussels, it can affect their reproduction and digestive season. ""If these marine organisms are having a negative health reaction to microplastics then humans presumably will too."" Professor Burke de Silva said it was important the study led to a change in local waste management. ""Each area needs to think about what specifically is being added to the ocean from their sites. ""We want to ensure that councils are looking into some industries that are adding microplastics to the water. ""We don't want it to get worse. We do know it's coming from South Australia — it's unlikely it's drifting in from other parts of the world."" She also said the aquaculture industry might also need to assess where they were farming. ""I think it's also very important that we look at where mussels and other seafood is being farmed because if you want to avoid any kind of accumulation of microplastics then you want it in areas with low levels of pollution."" Microplastics were found to be more abundant in mussel samples near larger towns and cities, with levels four times higher at Semaphore Beach compared to the more remote Ceduna on Eyre Peninsula. But Professor Burke da Silva said other sites tested, while not as high in microplastic samples, have greater ecological significance. ""Whyalla, for example, is a breeding ground of the great cuttlefish in the Northern Spencer Gulf and [there are] marine ecosystems more diverse than the Great Barrier Reef [that] live in the waters of Coffin Bay. ""So clean-up and prevention measures are long overdue."" Eyre Peninsula Seafoods chief executive Mark Andrews said any type of non-natural waste in water was a cause for concern, but farmed seafood, such as mussels, was monitored closely. ""These types of wastes accumulate over many years along the shoreline. This research paper has assessed mussels that are along the shoreline, only in intertidal water zones,"" he said. ""These particular mussels would have been there for 20 years or more, the growth in any intertidal zone is 100 per cent slower than in a subtidal zone where all farmed mussels in Australia are grown. ""All mussel harvesting zones in Australia are kilometres from the shoreline, where the mussels are grown 2 metres below the surface and are harvested within 12 months. ""The pristine waters of South Australia are monitored and managed by PIRSA's Aquaculture and the South Australian Shellfish Quality Assurance Program."" Mr Andrews said there has never been any evidence of microplastics in farmed mussels. He said the industry was finding ways to fight pollution. ""Each company is allocated kilometres of shoreline where four times a year we walk and collect all waste which is weighed and recorded.""

138,Plans to build 'world's largest solar project' in northern Australia reach new milestone,science,"  Environmental impact statement released for Sun Cable's $30 billion solar energy project Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Plans to build a massive solar energy project would result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in northern Australia but could also cause adverse effects, an environmental impact assessment (EIS) has found. Sun Cable intends to spend more than $30 billion on its Australia-Asia PowerLink, which would harness solar energy in the Northern Territory and transmit the power to Singapore via undersea cables. The company said it would be the world's largest solar energy infrastructure project. The project would have several ""potentially transformational"" positive impacts, including a 10 per cent reduction in the NT's greenhouse gas emissions, according to the EIS. It would also have the capacity to supply up to 15 per cent of Singapore's energy needs. Sun Cable hopes to begin construction in 2024 and expects the first phase to generate 1,750 jobs, as well as another 350 ongoing jobs across the project's 70-year lifespan. ""The lodgement of the EIS to the NT [Environment Protection Authority] is a significant milestone for the AAPowerLink,"" Sun Cable chief executive David Griffin said. The project includes several major elements, including a huge ""solar precinct"" near Elliott in the NT's Barkly region, where photovoltaic solar arrays would be installed on 12,000 hectares of land to generate up to 20 gigawatts of power, some of which would be stored in batteries. Sun Cable dramatically upscales plans to build a $30 billion solar farm in the NT, as Indonesia greenlights an undersea cable to Singapore. About 3.2 gigawatts of renewable energy would then be transmitted along 788 kilometres of overhead transmission lines, largely following the railway corridor to Darwin. A converter site would be set up on the coastline at Murrumujuk, 31 kilometres east of Darwin, where about 800 megawatts of power would be channelled into Darwin's electricity supply — almost double the region's current demand. The remaining power would then be transferred to undersea cables at the nearby Gunn Point beach where a subsea system involving three separate cables would run 4,200 kilometres to a converter station in Singapore. The EIS identified a range of potentially negative environmental impacts, which were categorised as minor to moderate risks. They included possible impacts on vulnerable plant species, including Darwin Cycads, near the converter site at Murrumujuk and nearby Gunn Point. Almost seven per cent of another threatened plant species known as Typhonium praetermissum would also be removed from the area. However, the EIS said the project was unlikely to affect fauna, including the Greater Bilby, the Yellow-spotted Monitor and eight threatened species of migratory shorebirds. It noted the undersea cables would pass through areas where several threatened and migratory marine animals occur, including turtles, dugongs, pygmy blue whales and whale sharks. But it found any impacts associated with extra noise and light from vessels, or electromagnetic fields from the cables, were minor. Sun Cable said it was conducting further surveys of threatened species to address any knowledge gaps. The EIS also noted that weeds could spread as a result of land clearing in the project areas. Among several other potentially negative impacts, Sun Cable flagged the prospect of reduced housing affordability and availability due to the influx of a large workforce. It also noted the possibility of increased COVID-19 outbreaks as a result of transient workers. The company said it was working closely with traditional owners to negotiate Indigenous Land Use Agreements. It said it also required approvals from the NT's Aboriginal Areas Protection Authority to ensure sacred sites would not be impacted. Sun Cable said the 800 megawatts of renewable energy it hopes to provide to the Darwin region ""will unlock new green industries including hydrogen and manufacturing."" Sun Cable is yet to secure contracts to supply renewable energy to Singapore, however it is understood commercial discussions are continuing with potential customers. In March, the company announced it had secured $210 million from existing shareholders, including Australian billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, to fund the development of the project. Last September, Sun Cable said it had received support from the Indonesian government for the project's electricity cables to travel through its waters.

139,Adelaide University sexual harassment case to assess whether professor made 'unwelcome' advance on colleague,science,"  Adelaide University sexual harassment case to assess whether professor made 'unwelcome' advance on colleague Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A senior University of Adelaide lecturer has told a South Australian tribunal that she was in shock in the days after a professor she respected had allegedly sexually harassed her at a hotel during a 2019 conference. Mathematical Sciences senior lecturer Giang Thu Nguyen has launched a sexual harassment complaint against her colleague, Professor Joshua Ross, in the SA Civil and Administrative Tribunal. She has also made a complaint against her employer, claiming the University of Adelaide failed to adequately handle her original complaint in November 2019. Dr Nguyen will seek $970,000 in compensation, if the tribunal finds she was sexually harassed. The tribunal heard Dr Nguyen claimed she was too drunk to have consented to sex with Professor Ross after a night of excessive alcohol consumption during the three-day conference in the Adelaide suburb of Glenelg. But Professor Ross — who is responsible for South Australia's COVID-19 modelling — denies the sexual harassment complaint, claiming Dr Nguyen was conscious and a ""willing participant"". Dr Nguyen told the tribunal she only had ""flashes"" of the sexual encounter and was in ""shock and denial"" in the days afterwards because she admired Professor Ross, who was ""one of the people I respected in the mathematics school"". Kerry Clark SC, for Dr Nguyen, told the tribunal her client had made a rape allegation to SA Police, but charges were not laid against Professor Ross. ""I should stress that is not what we're here to determine. This is a case of sexual harassment under the Equal Opportunity Act,"" she said. Ms Clark said the case centred on whether Professor Ross, on the balance of probabilities, made an ""unwelcome"" sexual advance on Dr Nguyen and whether a reasonable person ""in his shoes"" would have appreciated her level of intoxication and inability to consent. ""She [Dr Nguyen] made a pretty incoherent blog post during that period of drinking at the Pier Hotel — she wasn't making much sense,"" Ms Clark said. She added her client got ""stuck"" in a part of the hotel and had to call Professor Ross to rescue her and had periods of memory loss. Stephen Apps, for Professor Ross, told the tribunal that Dr Nguyen initiated the kiss between them as they walked home from the Glenelg Pier Hotel after 2am. He said CCTV showed Dr Nguyen was steady on her feet and could walk unaided back to the Stamford Grand hotel. ""She said words to the effect she was thinking of coming to his room. He foolishly said that sounded good,"" Mr Apps said. He said Professor Ross felt guilty about the sexual encounter because he was married so stopped it, and Dr Nguyen ""seemed annoyed"". ""They were both affected by alcohol, they both acted stupidly — something they would never have done if they were sober,"" Mr Apps told the tribunal. ""The crucial thing is they were fully conscious — there was no sexual harassment; Dr Nguyen was a willing participant."" Mr Apps told the tribunal that Dr Nguyen started telling colleagues about the sexual encounter with Professor Ross and mentioned she had been drunk. He said one colleague she spoke to mentioned that if she was too drunk to remember parts of the encounter, she must have been unable to consent. Jane Abbey, for the University of Adelaide, told the tribunal that the university took allegations of sexual harassment ""very seriously"", but it was not responsible for the conduct of Professor Ross because it did not occur at work. She submitted to the tribunal that both Professor Ross and Dr Nguyen were working during the hours of the conference but not afterwards. However, Ms Clark said her client would argue they were working from the time they checked in and checked out of the conference. The hearing continues.

140,Powerline fires wreak havoc but a renewable alternative is rolling out,science," ABC Rural Powerline fires wreak havoc but a renewable microgrid alternative is rolling out Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog After a spate of bushfires, a Western Australian regional electrical network is replacing overhead lines in fire-prone regions with off-grid solar and battery systems, or microgrids. In the first weekend of February, four emergency-level fires struck regional WA destroying homes, livestock, and vulnerable native bushland. Two of those fires started on overhead powerlines. In one of those fires near Wickepin, 220 kilometres south-east of Perth, it took only three minutes for Michael Lange's piggery to be engulfed in flame, killing thousands of pigs in their pens. The Department of Fire and Emergency Services investigated the Wickepin fire and found it was started by clashing power conductors, destroying two homes and 18,000 hectares of farms and native bushland. ""It was an electrical issue that could've well and truly been avoided,"" Mr Lange said. ""To me, [electrical infrastructure] has been run down to a point in the regional areas where these sorts of things are going to happen."" Network operator Western Power has replaced over 50km of burned lines with standalone solar, generator, and battery systems, accelerating its long-term plan to reduce regional WA's reliance on overhead lines. ""We're planning to install about 1,000 [standalone power systems] over the next four years, extending to 4,000 over a ten year period,"" acting asset operations executive Zane Christmas said. Mr Christmas acknowledged that the Wickepin fire was started on Western Power's powerlines, but said its regional lines were appropriately maintained with over $200 million of bushfire mitigation work annually. ""We do a lot of inspection. We have a very big vegetation cutting program. We address any defects in extreme-risk locations in the aim of having those cleared by December [each year],"" he said. ""We believe the network is as safe as it could be leading into the bushfire season."" Much of southern WA was hit by strong winds and high temperatures on the weekend of the four fire emergencies, and 10 districts had ""catastrophic"" fire warnings which a DFES spokesperson said was ""incredibly rare"". In such conditions, Mr Christmas acknowledges overhead lines are vulnerable even if adequately maintained. ""Things like extreme weather can cause those conductors to sag a little bit and this can be the consequence. It's really a number of factors coming together,"" he said. Regional towns once ran on their own power transfer stations, and it could be a case of history repeating if a new three-year study finds microgrids a viable option for resilient energy supply. Dr Elizabeth Ratnam, a future engineering research fellow at ANU and former systems planning engineer at Ausgrid, said the size of Australia's overhead line networks mean the regions are uniquely vulnerable to powerline fires. ""It was a big concern [when I worked at Ausgrid] and it still is. Bushfires are increasing in severity,"" she said. Dr Ratnam said embracing new technologies to create microgrids was among the best ways to reduce this risk and prevent fires. That is what Western Power has pledged to do with its standalone solar, generator, and battery systems. In February, the Australian Energy Market Commission changed its rules to allow standalone power systems to be installed in the National Electricity Market — the interconnected electricity system which covers all states and territories except WA and the Northern Territory. ""In remote, bushfire-prone areas, standalone power systems do away with the need to replace damaged grid connections at significant expense,"" AEMC chair Anna Collyer said. ""The power infrastructure that connects communities to the grid can also cause bushfires, which is another reason standalone power systems are attractive alternatives to traditional network connections in those areas."" In the two months since the fire, volunteers from across WA and interstate have flocked to help rebuild essential infrastructure. After three days without sleep, Mr Lange was flooded with offers for help from local volunteers who transformed the burned pig pens. ""We virtually rebuilt the whole facility in about four weeks,"" he said. ""If we'd done it ourselves it would've taken six or eight months."" In the nearby town of Narrogin, a team of volunteers for BlazeAid have set up camp, expecting to spend three or four months repairing fences on farms full-time. In addition to the burned pigs, the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development estimated 2,200 sheep were killed in the Wickepin fire. The hundreds of kilometres of fencing is essential to being able to restock the thousands of sheep displaced from those farms.

141,"The air here is so clean, they bottle it up and keep it in an archive",science,"  Tasmania's Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station program keeping track of the global atmosphere Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Earth's climate is changing, and the driving forces are changes occurring in the composition of the planet's atmosphere. At Tasmania's Kennaook/Cape Grim site, the Bureau of Meteorology operates a scientific observatory to measure the composition of some of the world's cleanest air. The station is on Tasmania's west coast, near the north-west tip — the location chosen because, when conditions are right, the air at Kennaook/Cape Grim has been transported from the vast Southern Ocean, by way of the westerly winds frequently encountered. This air is representative of the ""global"" atmosphere, unaffected by local pollution. The science program at Kennaook/Cape Grim is a collaboration between the bureau and CSIRO, with contributions from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), the University of Wollongong and other groups from around the world. The science program manages a team that chronicles the changing composition of the Earth's atmosphere to inform Australia and the world about the basic drivers of the changing climate. From this air, the science team measures: Scientists from around the world use data to understand the life cycle and impacts of various parts of the atmosphere, and how their influence changes over time. The data also enables scientists to calculate emissions of harmful substances nationally and globally. Kennaook/Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station and the related science program are guided by the World Meteorological Organization's Global Atmosphere Watch program. Elements of atmospheric composition are measured at several sites around the world. Few of these, and none in the southern hemisphere, do this as comprehensively as at Kennaook/Cape Grim. Data from this station is stored in the world data centres coordinated by the Global Atmosphere Watch program. Greenhouse gas measurements began at this station in 1976. It started with carbon dioxide and various halo carbons, which are potent synthetic greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide at that time was recorded at 330 parts per million (ppm). Nearly half a century later, it has increased by about 25 per cent. Work from the station now captures all of the major greenhouse gases, including: It also includes synthetic gases such as: Ozone in Earth's stratosphere protects our planet from some of the Sun's harshest radiation. Ozone-depleting substances are chemicals that destroy ozone in the stratosphere. These gases are responsible for the hole in the ozone layer. Many of these are also potent greenhouse gases. Concerns about the impact of these chemicals led to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer in 1985. This was followed by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete Ozone in 1987. The Montreal Protocol sought to curb production and called for ongoing monitoring of these chemicals in the atmosphere. Measurements from Kennaook/Cape Grim allow Australia to meet some of these monitoring requirements. The science team at the station routinely measures all the significant ozone-depleting substances. This is possible through a collaboration with the international Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experimental (AGAGE) network. Measurements of greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances are an important part of the work at Kennaook/Cape Grim, but there is much more. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere is changing in complex and subtle ways. These changes influence how the atmosphere and climate respond. For example: The science team takes detailed and precise measurements of these and more. This enables chronicling of the influence of all these factors and to understand changes over time. The bureau and CSIRO, along with contributions from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and the University of Wollongong, have been chronicling the changing composition of the global atmosphere, through their work at Kennaook/Cape Grim, since 1976. The work continues. More information can be found at the CSIRO's Cape Grim Data website.

142,This koala colony was on the verge of collapse before these researchers tried something new,science,"  How a koala colony affected by chlamydia and at 'immediate risk of local extinction' was revived Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A koala colony in Brisbane on the brink of collapse has not only recovered but more than doubled through a painstaking new way of managing the endangered species. When University of Queensland (UQ) researchers started the project in 2019, chlamydia was rampant and had infected 60 per cent of the colony. There was just one healthy breeding female across the 95-hectare Belmont Hill Reserve. ""The population was crashing,"" head researcher Sean FitzGibbon said. ""Now, we've got numerous females that are reproducing ... and there's now the likelihood that the colony will exist long into the future."" Dr FitzGibbon led a team of three, including two ecologists and a wildlife vet, to develop the new management approach. They hope to roll it out to at least a dozen colonies in steep decline, but the approach is costly and time consuming. Dr FitzGibbon said while a huge amount of time, money and effort went into treating sick koalas around Australia, efforts were largely ""fingers crossed"", opportunistic and ad hoc. For example, usually a member of the public would call in a sick or injured animal. It is then treated at a hospital and released back into the wild, where there was a high level of disease. ""Really, what have we achieved in doing that?"" Dr FitzGibbon said. ""Their prospects of getting infected with chlamydia again hasn't changed."" The UQ team, funded by Brisbane City Council, took what they believed to be the first ""systematic"" approach to wiping out the sexually transmitted infection and reviving the population. First, they took weeks searching every tree, craning their necks for at least 15 minutes on each one. When a koala was found, it was fitted with a GPS tracker and vet Amber Gillett gave each a health assessment in the bushland. Thirteen koalas were assessed. Five were healthy and released, six were euthanased and two were taken to hospital and released back about two months later. ""Some of them needed to be euthanased straight away, they were even having trouble climbing down a tree they were so unwell,"" Dr Gillett said. ""Unfortunately that's the chlamydial diseases story for koalas. ""No matter what treatment you throw at them, you cannot reverse the disease process. It's pretty nasty."" Despite the colony plummeting to just seven since the program's start, with successful breeding in the wild, and the injection of four healthy koalas rescued from other areas, the population has reached 15. ""Although it looks like you have a drop in growth, the overall output has increased,"" Dr Gillett said. ""The population has potentially doubled in two years. ""Over one to two generations of breeding, you start to get an acceleration, as you don't have those infertile animals impeding the population growth. ""We don't want to claim we've wiped chlamydia out entirely, but we may have. ""There's always the possibility that there is another koala out there that we haven't found."" The Belmont Hill Reserve is almost a closed colony, hemmed in by suburbia, a motorway and a busy thoroughfare. Dr FitzGibbon said their project would work in other populations that were similarly closed off, therefore almost negating the risk that chlamydia would be re-introduced. The program would not be successful in a sprawling national park. The research also examines if there are areas in the reserve that the koalas gravitate to, if and when they cross roads, and a koala's travelling range and therefore how much bushland would be needed to sustain one. Brisbane City Council invested about $500,000 into the four years of research running until 2023. To do it across Brisbane alone, Dr FitzGibbon said it would cost millions of dollars ""because it's just so time consuming"". ""We're calling on the Queensland government and local councils to work together to get koala survey teams to go out and do this and take a more strategic approach to treating sick koalas and conserving populations,"" he said. Dr Gillett said it was normal for ecologists survey koalas but having a vet do on-site assessments was one of the key's to the program's success. ""We can detect disease, even at low levels,"" she said. While some koalas just harbour the bacteria and transmit it, a large proportion can get conjunctivitis and become blind. Others get painful bladder infections and constantly dribble urine, or the bacteria can spread to the kidney and reproductive tract, leading to infertility. Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley said there were a number of grants that will become available in coming months to improve koala health and the practical application of research outcomes. ""While not a part of this research, we will closely monitor the findings and are always open to considering new approaches that maximise health outcomes and strategies for the koala health,"" she said. A Brisbane City Council spokesperson said the program successfully re-established a healthy population ""that was at immediate risk of local extinction"". ""We have demonstrated it can be done and we hope the program can be extended further and replicated across south-east Queensland and Australia. ""We hope that we can not only stop the decline of koalas but increase their numbers."" The state government has been contacted for comment.

143,"Why does my cat wake me up so early, and what can I do about it?",science,"  Why does my cat wake me up so early, and what can I do about it? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog You've got an important meeting in the morning and your cat wakes you at 4am. Why? And what can you do to stop this happening again? Although cats are evolved for night-time activity, during domestication they have adapted to human lifestyles. Domestic cats tend to be most active early in the morning and at dusk, not in the middle of the night. They also change their activity cycles to fit in with their human housemates. This means if you sleep at night, your cat should also be resting. And a lot of people do sleep with their cat. In a survey of women in the US, around 30 per cent slept with at least one cat. So why do some cats want to play in the wee hours? The reason why your cat is waking you up will often help you understand how to stop them. Here are three reasons your cat might be waking you up and how to address the issue. This is among the most common reasons. Unfortunately, one of the first things a sleepy person will do is feed their cat. This rewards the behaviour and makes the cat more likely to repeat it. To start addressing this problem, make sure your cat is getting enough to eat throughout the day. You can feed them a meal or a satisfying snack right before you go to bed. If you usually feed your cat in the morning, you need to make sure your cat is not associating wake up time with breakfast time. Leave a gap between when you get out of bed and when you feed kitty breakfast — aim for at least half an hour. You can also train your cat to associate something else with getting fed, such as saying ""breakfast time!"". Cats love predictability. Keeping a regular routine has even been associated with reduced stress levels in cats. Pets can experience mental ill-health, including anxiety. And while it can look different to human anxiety, some familiar treatments — like medication and mindfulness — can help. To maintain a routine, keep mealtimes, play times and any grooming close to the same time each day. Empty litter at regular, predictable intervals (dirty or disturbed litter may also be a reason your cat is waking you up). Try not to move litter trays, bowls or scratch posts around unless needed. If something changes in their environment — you go on holiday, move furniture or have a new house guest or pet — your cat may return to early morning wake up calls. This is typical for cats. Keep the routine as consistent as you can and eventually your cat will settle in to the new normal. It's common knowledge cats love to sleep, but they also love to play and move their bodies just like us. It's important to give your cat access to a variety of toys and resources around the house to interact with, especially if you're not home often. Scratch posts offer cats a place to climb and stretch. Balls, soft and motorised toys give them an opportunity to play and exercise. When you are home, engage your cat with an interactive toy (like a cat wand) or play a game of chase around the house. You can even try making up a game your cat will enjoy. Cats get bored easily. Keep variety in your play times. And don't play with your cat in the hour before you want to go to bed. Ideally, a play session before you go out and once you get home should help to keep your kitty quiet overnight. Your cat might still wake you up for some time. This behaviour may even get worse in the short term as your cat adjusts. The key is to ignore your cat's behaviour at night or in the early morning. Don't get up and, if you can, don't interact with your cat when they wake you. If you've tried everything and your cat still wakes you up, it's time to go to see your veterinarian. There might be a health reason causing the behaviour. Hopefully, you and your cat can come to an agreement about when it's sleep time and when it's wake-up time. It is definitely possible to love your cat and still get your sleep. Susan Hazel is a senior lecturer in the School of Animal and Veterinary Science at the University of Adelaide.

144,"This winter will be no normal flu season, thanks to COVID",science," Health Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As the mercury drops and days get shorter, sniffles, sore throat and other classic symptoms of flu typically start rearing their snotty, grotty heads. But this winter, we're looking down the barrel of an unusual flu season. Right now, we have the more contagious BA.2 COVID sub-variant sweeping across the nation, since reaching our shores in January. Over the past couple of years, COVID restrictions and border closures crushed influenza infections to historic lows. Last year, researchers thought one flu virus called the Yamagata virus might even be stamped out altogether (and, in the months since that article was published, there have been no further reported cases of Yamagata). But just because the flu's been noticeably absent over the past couple of years, doesn't mean it won't pose a real problem for us this year. For this reason, in March, the Australian government announced it would provide a $2.1 billion health package to tackle the problem of flu and COVID this winter. So why all the kerfuffle about influenza now, and what's changed since last winter when it comes to COVID, flu, and vaccination? We're vulnerable simply because we've had so few flu infections in 2021 (and that's despite only about a third of people getting a flu shot last year). The reason for historic low flu levels is because the virus, in non-pandemic years, hitches a ride on incoming passengers from overseas. But with international borders closed for the best part of the past two years, and the trickle of arrivals spending two weeks in quarantine, any inbound flu viruses were essentially stopped before they could take hold in the wider population. With a fraction of the usual flu infections, there aren't too many people today who have immune protection generated from catching the virus. Now, with borders open and quarantine rules relaxed, it's inevitable that flu will spread — and we're already beginning to see it, said Ian Barr, deputy director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute. ""We've gone from a non-season in 2021 to things starting to happen here in Australia."" According to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, which keeps tabs on lab-confirmed influenza case numbers, Australia racked up 409 cases in March — most of which were in Victoria and NSW. ""And that was nearly the equivalent of the total for 2021, which was 598 cases,"" Professor Barr said. ""So things are picking up and there will be higher numbers in April. So we're already off to a bit of a flying start."" The Northern Hemisphere has not long emerged from winter. So how did they fare when it came to flu? As you might expect, different regions experienced different flu seasons, likely due to different levels of restrictions like mask-wearing and border closures. ""In Europe, some countries, like the UK, have had relatively quiet flu seasons, France has had more of an influenza season, and Scandinavia probably somewhere in between,"" Professor Barr said. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the hospitalisation rate for the 2021/22 flu season is lower than the rate at this time of year for the four years preceding the pandemic. But what's unusual about this US flu season is it hasn't followed the typical pattern of a rise, peak, then fall in cases. Instead, it looks like the US season will have two peaks. After the first peak in 2021, another wave is picking up again now. The reason for this isn't entirely clear, but Professor Barr suspects US flu cases are rising and falling due to people changing behaviour during and between COVID outbreaks. ""If COVID goes up, people stay home more often, and there's less mixing. Some US states have more rigid rules on mask-wearing and school closures, so probably all those things come into account to stop influenza. ""Then it starts [rising] again when mixing starts to happen again."" Relatively low overall flu numbers abroad are a reason for cautious optimism for Australia as the weather cools. ""It's a hard thing to predict, but I think it's likely we'll have a low-to-moderate season rather than a severe season,"" Professor Barr said. ""But once enough of these viruses get in, it could take off. "" Vaccination is crucial if we're to keep a lid on flu numbers this year. The reason we need a flu shot every year is because influenza is a shape-shifter; it mutates readily, creating new viruses that we have no immune protection against. So the vaccine is tweaked to protect us against specific members of the flu-virus family, selected for inclusion, for instance, if they spread overseas. In Australia, anyone over the age of 6 months is recommended to have a yearly seasonal flu vaccine. Certain groups are strongly recommended to be vaccinated. These are: Even without COVID circulating, anyone in these groups is at greater risk of complications and severe illness if they catch the flu. For instance, pregnant women at any stage of their pregnancy are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot, says Megan Rees, head of the Royal Melbourne Hospital's Sleep and Respiratory Unit. ""We saw terrible swine flu in 2009, and we had lots of pregnant women really severely unwell with influenza."" It's around this time of year that flu shots are rolled out in Australia, and that's no accident. Antibodies generated by the flu shot tend to wane a little after about four months, but still provide ""very solid protection for at least six months, probably a bit more than that"", Dr Rees said. So when our flu season peaks, which is usually in August, we are already protected. And should the flu season come early, we're ready for that too. Health authorities gear up for the first real flu season in three years, with experts particularly worried about the impact on young children. But this, as we know, isn't a normal flu season. So when will it peak? That's a difficult question at the best of times, Dr Rees said. ""We think this year, flu could come very early. We're a bit worried about that. ""So our recommendation would be to get your flu vaccine as soon as possible, and you will be well protected for August and September, even if you got your flu vaccine now."" While the effectiveness of flu vaccines isn't as high as we've seen with the mRNA COVID vaccines, they do help stop the disease spread and, should you be infected by a flu virus, stop you from getting as sick. And, of course, a flu vaccine (plus COVID vaccines) will decrease your risk of being co-infected with COVID. And that's important because ... We're yet to see widespread influenza and COVID-19 at the same time in Australia, and overseas data puts flu co-infection at less than 1 per cent of COVID infections (although estimates vary by region). Israeli health authorities have detected a case of what some are calling ""flurona"" — a double dose of COVID-19 and the flu. It comes as the country is experiencing a spike in influenza cases in recent weeks, sparking fears of a ""twindemic"". But patients with the flu/COVID combo — dubbed ""flurona"" — are likely to appear as rules and restrictions continue to relax, and this has Dr Rees worried. ""I certainly haven't looked after any patients yet who've had both at the same time, but there is quite a bit of overseas data that suggests that you get much sicker if you have both of them at the same time."" Recently, a study of more than 200,000 people in the UK found patients with COVID and flu had twice the risk of dying than people infected with the COVID virus alone, echoing conclusions drawn by previous studies. For this reason, some hospitals, including the Royal Melbourne, already routinely test all patients with respiratory symptoms for both flu and COVID, Dr Rees said. A flu test is similar to a COVID test: a nose and throat swab, which is sent to a lab for analysis. Last year, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) recommended spacing out your COVID and flu vaccines by two weeks. They've since done away with that advice, and people are now encouraged to get both at the same time. So what changed? That 14-day break between COVID and flu shots was mostly a precaution in case people had a reaction to either vaccine, Professor Barr said. Get the latest health news and information from across the ABC. Spacing them out meant it was easier to attribute any side effects to one vaccine or the other. ""Now we know only a small proportion of people have significant side effects from the COVID vaccine, and we know that [vaccine] co-administration is safe,"" Professor Barr said. ""There's very little risk [of side effects] with standard vaccinations, COVID or otherwise, with influenza vaccine."" There's another benefit to having both shots in the same sitting, Dr Rees said. ""You get it done. If you have to come back on separate occasions, sometimes people don't get the second one.""

145,University maths professor accused of sexual harassment in tribunal documents,science,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide has filed a sexual harassment complaint in a South Australian tribunal against the professor responsible for the state's COVID-19 modelling. In documents filed in the SA Civil and Administrative Tribunal, senior mathematics lecturer Giang Thu Nguyen has accused Professor Joshua Ross of sexual harassment and the University of Adelaide of failing to adequately handle her complaint. Professor Ross, who denies the allegations, is behind modelling used by SA Health to predict the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations. Dr Nguyen is seeking $580,000 in compensation for breaches to the Equal Opportunity Act. Documents stated that Dr Nguyen and Professor Ross were among a group of university employees who went out for social drinks during a three-day conference at the Stamford Grand hotel in the beachside Adelaide suburb of Glenelg on October 31, 2019. It stated the group went out for dinner at Sammy's on the Marina, before drinks continued at the Moseley Bar and Kitchen and the Glenelg Pier Hotel until 2am. ""By around this time, [Dr Nguyen] was extremely intoxicated to the extent that she experienced significant memory impairment, loss of balance and coordination, slurred speech and slow decision making,"" the document stated. It added that Dr Nguyen went back to the professor's hotel room, where she alleges she was sexually assaulted as she ""moved in and out of consciousness during the sexual intercourse"". ""[She] did not have the cognitive capacity to consent,"" the complaint stated. The documents stated that Dr Nguyen reported the incident to Yarrow Place – a service for sexual assault victims – and SA Police the following day. She reported it to her University of Adelaide superiors three days later, the documents state. According to her complaint, the lecturer claims the university did not investigate her complaint, did not support her and did not take a statement from the professor. She also claims the university ""did not have in force at the relevant time, appropriate policies for the prevention of sexual harassment and sexual assault"". In his response to the complaint, Professor Ross stated the sexual encounter was consensual and Dr Nguyen was not significantly impaired by alcohol. He said in documents filed with the tribunal that she was able to withdraw money from an ATM, purchase drinks at the Moseley and the Glenelg Pier Hotel and was not uneasy on her feet. ""[Professor Ross] denies the allegations and asserts [Dr Nguyen] attended his hotel room freely and unaided and was at all times lucid,"" documents stated. His response to the complaint also stated that SA Police had not laid any charges following its investigation into the allegation. The University of Adelaide responded in documents that it ""acknowledges the very serious nature of the complaint"" and ""does not tolerate sexual harassment"". The university claims it interviewed both parties and concluded there was ""insufficient basis on which to make a positive finding that the alleged assault occurred"". ""In forming that view, the university does not contend that [Dr Nguyen] lied – it acknowledges she says [the professor's] behaviour was unwelcome and that she did not consent,"" documents stated. The university said that it did support its employee after the complaint was disclosed to senior staff and it appointed an independent investigator to conduct an initial assessment. In 2020, the culture at the university made headlines after it was revealed more than 50 reports of sexual assault and harassment had been made since 2018. The Independent Commissioner Against Corruption also found then-vice-chancellor Peter Rathjen had committed ""serious misconduct"" by sexually harassing two women.

146,"Hungry sharks smart enough to avoid tourists' empty promises, study suggests",science,"  Research into Port Jackson sharks a hint into great white shark feeding behaviour Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog New research studying the behaviour of Port Jackson sharks has led researchers to investigate if tantalising, but not giving food to great white sharks for tourism purposes, could make great white sharks less likely to reappear. The study, published in the journal Animal Behaviour, revealed the sharks' interest in the smell of food declined if they were not sufficiently rewarded by the promise of eating. The observation suggests that sharks learn to avoid wasting time and energy on inaccessible food sources. The researchers, including lead author Dennis Heinrich from Flinders University, said the results were a catalyst for discovering sharks' evolutionary ability to learn. Shark ecologist Charlie Huveneers, from the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders University, said the research observed how three separate groups of Port Jackson sharks in captivity reacted when being exposed to the smell of a prey species. ""The group of sharks that was always rewarded [with food] quickly learnt the task and became better and faster at reaching the target,"" Professor Huveneers said. ""That learnt response was drastically reduced in the group that wasn't rewarded as frequently. ""More interestingly, if you didn't have any reward at all we saw an opposite trend. Instead of the sharks getting to the target faster, we had habituation where the sharks didn't respond to the smell at all; completely ignoring it."" Professor Huveneers said tourism operators needed to find the right balance when trying to attract sharks to an area for the shark cage diving industry. ""They would have to be minimising any kind of association of learnt behaviour, but also making sure they can still attract the sharks using smell for example, because if there's no reward whatsoever then there won't be any attraction after a certain amount of time,"" he said. The researchers will now test their findings with shark species that are more commonly targeted by wildlife tourism, such as great white sharks, to determine if shark habits can be detected at tourism locations such as Port Lincoln. Calypso Star on the Eyre Peninsula is the only one-day shark cage diving operator permitted to use berley to attract great whites, a technique that is controversial in the community. Researchers have started collecting data on great white sharks, using acoustic tracking to study their residency and their relationship with boats. Andrew Wright, co-owner and operator of Calypso Shark Charters in Port Lincoln, said habituation ""probably rings true"" but there are already strict regulations in place for operators that have evolved over the past five years. ""There's been a lot of regulation come in about when the shark gets the bait, a lot of days we go a whole day without losing bait at all, or some days we only lose one or two when there's four or five sharks around so that's not a big loss,"" he said. For the residents of this small Australian town, a series of shark attacks prompted an almost existential crisis. What does it mean to love the ocean when it's a place of so much grief? ""When a shark takes the bait or contacts the cage, we can't put any bait or berley in the water for 15 minutes. ""We have to report that on a daily basis [and] there's checks and balances in place to ensure operators are doing the same thing."" Mr Wright also said that the Neptune Islands, where shark cage operators go, is home to more than 30,000 long nose fur seals so food sources are already plentiful. ""It will certainly be very interesting to see if [the study] turns on everyone's head, the whole thought that shark diving is a negative sort of thing and that it actually attracts sharks to an area … it will be interesting if once and for all we can refute that.""

147,Here are some of the spurious claims parties are trying to scare you with this election,science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Both the Coalition and Labor are relying heavily on scare campaigns as they battle to attract the attention of voters ahead of the May 21 federal election. The major parties have launched attacks on their opponents based on spurious claims and out-dated policies, both in person and via social media. Scare campaigns often feature in elections, but such is their prominence in this election battle that they risk distracting from genuine debate over policies and ideas. So which scare campaigns should you be looking out for in this campaign? Follow all the post-election action as vote counting continues On the hustings for votes in Western Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is turning to a decade-old issue. ""Should we be successful at the forthcoming election, I can assure you there will be no mining tax, there will be no carbon tax, and there will be no adverse changes to fuel tax credit arrangements, either,"" Mr Morrison told the WA Chamber of Commerce. The comments hark back to the Mineral Resources Rent Tax (MRRT) and the carbon pricing schemes introduced by Julia Gillard's government in 2012. Both policies were repealed by the Abbott government in 2014 and Labor no longer supports them, instead promoting higher emissions reduction targets and expanding the use of the existing ""safeguard mechanism"" introduced by the Coalition. The Greens support changes to the fuel tax credit, which reimburses tax on fuel used for business purposes, but Labor does not. Labor is promoting a spurious claim that the Coalition intends to put all age pension payments onto cashless debit cards, which restrict how welfare payments can be spent. Cashless debit cards are like regular bank cards, but they cannot be used to buy alcohol, gambling products or to withdraw cash. They're currently being used in six trial sites and apply to a range of different welfare payments, but it is voluntary for age pensioners to take part. Labor MP Julian Hill shared an undated video on social media that shows Social Services Minister Anne Ruston being asked if she intends to make cashless debit cards compulsory. She responds by saying: ""I'm not going to pre-empt that. This is the start of a consultation."" The Coalition has previously sought to expand the use of cashless debit cards beyond the trial sites, but does not have a policy to put all age pension payments on them. From humble beginnings, a campaign driven by Labor MPs has grown, implying the Coalition has a plan to expand the cashless debit card to age pensioners. Is there any evidence, or is it a scare campaign? But Labor's campaign spokesman Jason Clare is unapologetic about his colleagues promoting the claim on social media. ""The Liberal Party have form here,"" he said. ""Look at what they say in the last two years, don't look at what they say on the eve of an election... whenever the Liberal Party get a chance, they'll always come after you on this."" Speaking to News Corp, Council on the Ageing CEO Ian Yates criticised Labor for ""scaring old people"" by repeating the claim. ""We are 100 per cent sure that the claim has no factual basis at all,"" he said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison weighed in, demanding Labor ""stop frightening pensioners."" ""It is an out and-out disgusting lie,"" he said. Cabinet minister Anne Ruston has been nominated as the next health minister if the Coalition wins the election, prompting Labor to claim she supports cuts to Medicare. The ALP points to comments Senator Ruston made in a parliamentary debate in 2015, that: ""Medicare in its current form is not sustainable into the future without some change being made."" Those comments, and other similar remarks at the time, were made when then-prime minister Tony Abbott was trying to introduce a GP co-payment — a policy that was roundly defeated and subsequently abandoned by the Coalition. Labor's campaign spokesman Jason Clare insists Senator Ruston ""is saying that the credit card is maxed out and we can't afford bulk billing in the future."" But questioned about those remarks on Sunday, Senator Ruston rejected the characterisation of her comments in 2015 and pointed to the Coalition's current health policies. ""Our government has been absolutely clear that we are not cutting Medicare,"" she said. The Coalition is claiming the election of a Labor government would lead to household electricity bills rising, on average, by $560 a year. That is based on Labor's ""Re-Wiring the Nation"" policy, which would upgrade electricity infrastructure to accommodate the influx of renewable energy with a combined investment of $20 billion from the Commonwealth and more than $50 billion from the sector. The Coalition has not released the ""modelling"" it says underpins its claim that the policy will lead to household bills rising by $560 a year. Speaking on Tuesday, Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor avoided mentioning the $560 figure, but insisted Labor's policy would cost households dearly. ""Consumers always pay for Labor's promises.... Labor always wants to make these grand promises and it ends up being Australians who pay."" But analysts have told the ABC it is does not appear the ""modelling"" takes into account wholesale electricity prices falling as a result of more renewable energy being able to enter the grid. ""That scare campaign is based upon a view somehow that renewables aren't the cheapest form of new energy,"" Labor leader Anthony Albanese said. It's also not clear whether the figures put forward by the Coalition are compared to current electricity prices, future prices without investment in the transmission upgrades, or future prices under the Coalition's policy. Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers accuses Mr Taylor of ""add[ing] fuel to the bin-fire of lies that this government tells about renewable energy."" Transmission upgrades are essential, as future energy generation will come from more dispersed locations from wind and solar farms, rather than a small number of coal-fired power plants. Labor leader Anthony Albanese tripped up on his party's border protection policy in the first week of the campaign, suggesting the ALP backed boat turn-backs, offshore processing and temporary protection visas (TPVs). He quickly corrected the record to note the ALP does not support TPVs. The Liberals seized on the mention of the policy difference on TPVs to suggest there would be a resumption of asylum seekers arriving by boat if Labor was re-elected. Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews insists TPVs ""are there to be very, very strong deterrents"" to asylum seekers and therefore a crucial part of Operation Sovereign Borders. ""You can't say you support Operation Sovereign Borders if you don't support temporary protection visas,"" she said. Shadow Home Affairs Minister Kristina Keneally described that as ""absolute rubbish"" and ""lying"", given TPVs have not been used as part of Operation Sovereign Borders. ""No-one has gone on a temporary protection visa, who has attempted to come by boat, since the introduction of Operation Sovereign Borders,"" she said. Senator Keneally said TPVs were not relevant, given Labor would also use boat turn-backs and offshore processing to prevent boat arrivals from reaching Australian shores. ""Anyone who attempts to come by boat will either be turned back or sent to Nauru,"" she said. The Liberal Party has campaigned to ""Stop Labor's Retiree Tax"" through advertisements and petitions online. It is a reference to Labor's franking credits policy at the 2019 election, which sought to close a concession that gives cash refunds for excess dividend imputation credits, a change which would largely affect retirees with shareholdings. Labor officially dumped the policy last year, with Mr Albanese declaring Labor got the message the policy change was not supported by voters. ""We will not be taking any changes to franking credits to the next election,"" he said.

148,"NSW father and son shoot for the stars, turning farms-and-mines town into drones and aerospace hardware hub",science,"  Drone, space, balloon technology developed by father and son at West Wyalong to help save lives Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog You wouldn't necessarily expect a regional town known for its gold mining and agriculture to be the next ""centre of drone excellence"", but this father and son did. Flight Design research and development manager Robert Brand and his son, Jason, are setting up a facility at West Wyalong in the New South Wales Riverina to study, develop, and analyse aerospace and space hardware. The 70-year-old has high hopes for some of the potentially ""lifesaving"" hardware. He said it could have been valuable during the Black Summer bushfires and recent flood emergency in the east of the country. ""My house was one of the first almost to be burnt down in the 2019 fires in Hazelbrook [in the Blue Mountains],"" he said. ""The people would've been able to get a very clear view of what the fire was doing 24 hours a day, not just during the daylight hours when it's safe to fly helicopters. ""This changes the whole game, totally."" The facility will also host workshops for people wanting to learn how to fly drones, get their licences, and provide a space for organisations to test their own technology. The Brands started working on a project to send balloons into the sky that will stabilise at an altitude of about 16 kilometres, something Robert Brand said had never been achieved. ""They'll have solar power, they'll have batteries, they'll be able to just motor gently against the wind up there, which is pretty light,"" he said. ""We can fly a system to a disaster zone and provide visuals of what's going on, and provide radio communications to people on the ground. ""We need to be able to get this technology bedded down really well and into the hands of our defence forces, firefighters, and the SES. ""If we can do that, it will change this country."" The most recent balloon launch, which contained a prototype sensor for a future mission to Mars, testing flight systems, cameras, controllers, and stabilisers, was a success. Mr Brand said the technology could also be used by farmers, universities, space enterprises and environmental workers. ""We'll see drone activity multiply by, I don't know, I'm forecasting about 20-fold in the next five years,"" he said. At 20, Jason Brand is the CEO of Flight Design. He is also the youngest person to win the Australian Industry and Defence Network Young Achiever New South Wales award. ""I was nine years old the first time we went on a balloon launch,"" he said. ""Long story short: the amateur radio club we knew were going to do one. ""They said, 'It's too difficult, we're not going to do it', so sad and I decided that we wanted to and it all started from there."" Growing up, school never agreed with Jason. He barely got his Higher School Certificate. So, he took matters into his own hands, literally. ""I learn in my own way and that's through doing, researching on the internet, actually having the objects in my hand and programming them,"" he said. Jason built his first drone at the age of 11, and put together computers shortly after. Robert works closely with his son to create never-before-used technology. They both have a shared vision to innovate and improve systems. Originally, Robert, with his lifetime of experience working for telecommunications companies and even the Apollo 11 mission, was leading the charge. But that has recently changed, with Jason taking control. ""He's coordinating all this stuff. I create the weird stuff that Jason has to sort out and put together,"" Robert said. It has been quite the journey. ""It can be tough. It can be very tough,"" Jason laughed. ""It can, but it can be really rewarding too,"" Robert chimed in. ""The most important thing is setting those boundaries and knowing the difference between work and actually being dad and son,"" Jason said. Bland Shire Council executive assistant Julie Sharpe said it was an ""exciting opportunity"" for West Wyalong. The council hired local and regional contractors to build the hangar at the airport. ""We can be at the forefront through our partnership in the development and testing of this new and modern technology, which is only going to expand in years to come,"" Ms Sharpe said. ""West Wyalong is known for gold production and agriculture, so this is very unique for us.""

149,"PFAS water contamination an unprecedented issue, Erin Brockovich says, as huge Australian plant nears completion",science,"  Katherine's PFAS water treatment plant finally ready for action — but more will follow, experts warn Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog In a small remote town in the outback, a multi-million-dollar mega facility shipped in from America will soon turn potentially toxic drinking water into some of the cleanest in Australia. It is the largest to be built so far and one of the first, but experts and activists say many more will be needed as Australia begins to deal with PFAS contamination. A few years ago, residents of Katherine received the alarming news that the water they had been using was contaminated by a group of human-made chemicals known as PFAS, which some experts say are linked to cancers and other serious health concerns. Between 1988 and 2004, during firefighting training at the Tindal RAAF Base, PFAS leached into the Katherine River and spread kilometres through the highly connected aquifer below. The government advised against eating fish caught from the river, the local swimming pool was closed, bore-reliant properties surrounding the base were delivered bottled water by Defence and residents lined up for blood tests. A major study on the health effects of PFAS and a landmark class action were launched and an interim water treatment plant was brought in, but its size left many in fear the clean water would run out. Since then, residents have been clinging to the promise Australia's largest PFAS water treatment plant would be built and after years of delays it has been confirmed the facility will be completed by August at the latest. Senior project manager at Power and Water Corporation Liam Early said it would deliver ""very high-quality water,"" and agreed it would likely be the first of many needed across Australia as the nation began to grapple with the enormity of PFAS contamination. ""PFAS is a problem around Australia in a multitude of places,"" he said. ""Until the PFAS issue is addressed, there will need to be a plant of some nature to remove the PFAS if it's deemed to be above acceptable levels."" Associate professor Suzie Reichman, an expert in pollution science at the University of Melbourne, said the sticky substances were known as ""forever chemicals"" because of their persistence in the environment and could be found in hundreds of everyday products like cosmetics, sunscreens and non-stick pans. ""Evidence is mounting that high concentrations can have a number of health impacts, including cancer,"" Dr Reichman said. ""We haven't definitively proven that in humans, but we also don't know what concentrations cause [cancers]. ""The Australian government has taken a very precautionary approach and we have very low thresholds for PFAS in the environment, including in drinking water. ""But because it wasn't on people's radars as a contaminant for so long, we're now seeing it has gotten out into the environment … the more we look the more we're finding."" With an already high reliance on groundwater projected to rise across Australia as surface resources become less available due to climate change and droughts, Dr Reichman said treatment plants, despite their expense, would offer a good solution. ""We have already contaminated the environment with PFAS, and if it's the only source of water, the solution to keep it safe for people and stock … is to clean it up,"" she said. ""This is the unfortunate legacy of PFAS."" Erin Brockovich said filtration systems were being installed across the US, where PFAS had turned up in the water supplies of communities across the country. ""I'm currently working on this issue in Maine where we're looking at all of the organic farming being destroyed,"" she said. ""It's in the cattle, it's in the chicken eggs, it's in the aquifer, it's in people's [bore] wells. ""It's happening here in California, it's already happened to Alabama — it's happening everywhere in Michigan. ""It's happening at every single military base throughout the United States."" Ms Brockovich said a massive effort at local, state, and federal levels had begun to address PFAS including installing filtration systems on bore wells. She said, after a slow start, the US was finally taking note of science and research that showed PFAS was widespread and dangerous. Firefighters working at airports across Australia have been found with up to 20 times the normal level of toxic PFAS chemicals in their blood, documents obtained by the ABC under freedom of information laws reveal. She warned Australia needed to be prepared and proactive. ""We are seeing and making associations of this chemical with reproductive issues, in particular,"" Ms Brockovich said. ""We're seeing testicular cancers, we're seeing health implications with firemen and military men who are directly exposed to this chemical. ""So let's start being prepared, let's start looking at where the contamination is, let's start getting all the municipalities with filtration systems. ""We're not kidding when we say this is going to be the largest emerging groundwater contamination and food supply chain [issue] that we have ever seen. ""We cannot afford to just keep burying our heads in the sand."" The water treatment plant was delayed by a design process that took 24 months, as well as COVID and supply issues, Mr Early said. When it is turned on it will be able to process 15 megalitres of water every day — more than enough for Katherine, which in the height of the dry season uses a maximum of 12 megalitres. After water is sucked up from the groundwater through a bore, it is processed through the pressure vessels. Microplastics made of resin called ""media"" capture the PFAS and remove it from the water. ""Then what we have is a back-flushing process,"" Mr Early said. ""The concentration [of toxic contaminants] gets flushed out and disposed of in an evaporation pond."" When enough solids had built up in the evaporation pond, Mr Early said, it would be dug out and ""disposed of at a suitable waste disposal site"". While Defence continues to filter contaminated water and pump it back into aquifers at Katherine, Oakey and Williamtown, ongoing droughts and lingering health concerns are far from over for residents. Peter Spafford, Katherine's sole GP during the peak of the PFAS scare, said long-term health issues were still a worry for residents despite a major study finding no conclusive evidence of increased risk of cancer or disease in the three towns. Amid over-pumping, drought, and the steady influence of climate change, he said the treatment plant was a ""bandaid measure"". ""It's tapping into underground water supplies, which, certainly with decreased rainfall and the increased usage due to fracking, [are] not necessarily sustainable,"" Dr Spafford said.

150,This greenkeeper built an observatory to study planets. His work is helping scientists understand Saturn,science,"  Amateur Broken Hill astronomer wins Astronomical Society of Australia award Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A Broken Hill amateur astronomer has won a national award for his contribution to a broad range of planetary science, particularly his work observing Saturn. Trevor Barry was awarded joint winner of the Astronomical Society of Australia's 2022 Berenice and Arthur Page Medal at the weekend. The award is given to amateur astronomers who have contributed significantly to the science. Mr Barry said he was amazed he picked up the medal given his background, which included working in the local mines for a number of years. ""We're such a small community, we're very isolated but Broken Hill people have actually excelled in such a wide range of fields ... obviously mining and the arts and sport,"" he said. ""To think that maybe in some small way I've lifted the exposure of Broken Hill now in astronomy [is wonderful]."" The other winner of this year's award was the Backyard Observatory Supernova Search (BOSS) team — a group that has found around 200 confirmed supernovas. Mr Barry's pathway to national astronomy recognition is an unusual one. The former mine worker is also a passionate local greenkeeper, and was selected as a finalist in the Volunteer of the Year category at last year's Bowls SA Awards. He said he was also exploring the depths of space with his own custom-built observatory. ""I'm not doing my work with professionally made equipment,"" he said. ""I designed and built my observatory. I designed and built my telescope. I designed and built the mount that that telescope swings on. ""I love what I do. I claim to be the only 'astronomer-greenkeeper' in Australia."" Astronomical Society of Australia President John Lattanzio said Mr Barry's work analysing Saturn had contributed to a number of research papers. Professor Lattanzio said the work was helping astronomers understand a hexagonal feature in the planet's atmosphere. ""His data has been used by NASA and the Cassini mission in particular to fill in places when they can't see things,"" he said. ""It's led to a huge amount of data. I think he's got almost nine years of monitoring this. ""It's really a fantastic effort for an amateur astronomer. It's remarkable."" He said while Mr Barry might not be a professional scientist, he was still contributing important scientific work. ""That's sort of the aim of this medal, to recognise people who aren't being paid for doing this but are making significant advances, and that's exactly what Trevor's been doing,"" he said. ""Heartiest congratulations to him. He's an excellent role model for us all.""

151,"A 'little baby' the size of an elephant: Meet Ollie, Australia's smallest sauropod dinosaur",science,"  Australia's smallest sauropod dinosaur confirmed from fossils found in outback Queensland Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Fossils unearthed in outback Queensland more than a decade ago have been officially identified as Australia's smallest sauropod. The juvenile Diamantinasaurus matildae, nicknamed ""Ollie"", is the third of its species to be discovered and roamed the earth some 95 million years ago. The rare discovery was made by a sheep grazier near Winton in western Queensland in 2012 and took researchers years to excavate and analyse. It is the first juvenile sauropod to ever be found in Australia. The plant-eating dinosaur is estimated to have measured about 11 metres in length and weighed 4.2 tonnes— roughly the size of an adult elephant — at the time of its death. ""So even though we're talking about a little baby, he's not actually that small,"" palaeontologist Samantha Rigby said. Adult sauropods measured between 20m to 30m in length. ""Some of the bones in his body weren't fused, so we know that [Ollie] was a juvenile,"" Ms Rigby said. Dozens of fossils were unearthed during the excavation process, including thoracic vertebrae, ribs, a scapula, a humerus, a thumb claw and a femur. Ms Rigby, who is the lead author of the research paper published last week and a masters student at Swinburne University, said the discovery would help researchers understand how the species grew. ""I spent a really long time comparing Ollie with all of the adult specimens here in Winton and we found that Ollie is not an exact copy of the adult,"" she said. ""The limb bones of this juvenile titanosaur grew at a more rapid rate than its back and shoulder bones. ""The bones are also narrower in width when compared with the robust limb bones of an adult Diamantinasaurus."" The discovery suggests that, like humans, baby sauropods would have changed as they grew older. ""Ollie's limbs were a lot more overgrown and as he grew up, he grew into his limbs,"" Ms Rigby said. ""He would have looked a bit weird with really long legs and a small body."" It is not clear how Ollie died, but researchers believe it is likely he became stuck in mud near a watering hole and sank. ""For us, it means that fossils below the surface are preserved quite well and in good condition,"" she said. Ms Rigby, from Brisbane, fell in love with dinosaurs when she travelled to Winton as a teenager. ""I visited the Australian Age of Dinosaurs museum when I was 16 as a birthday present from my grandma,"" she said. The trip sparked a lifelong ambition. ""I knew from then that this was the place for me, and that I was going to end up one day being a part of the team,"" she said. Over the past several years, Ms Rigby and a team of researchers at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs have scanned the ancient fossils to create 3D images. ""It's really important for us to be able to compare what we're finding here and see how that relates to other sauropod species around the world so we can understand how they evolved,"" Ms Rigby said. ""I'm really lucky that I was given the opportunity to study the first juvenile sauropod in Australia."" Ollie's bones are now part of the sauropod collection at the Australian Age of Dinosaurs in Winton. The centre's founder David Elliott is confident the discovery will draw in tourists from across the country — and even the world. Paleo-tourism is already booming across western Queensland and operators believe the lifting of state and international borders will lead to more crowds. ""Now that the borders aren't closed, I should expect the numbers will be just as good this year,"" Mr Elliott said. ""You never really know, but I'm optimistic that it will be a good year.""

152,"It's one of the first things visitors notice in Tasmania — roadkill, everywhere",science,"  Roadkill data paints bloody picture of wildlife carnage across Tasmania Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The blood-red lines on the map of Tasmania, along every road, tell the story. Seen close up, red dots indicate the locations of roadkill, as reported by the public over a three-year period. Zoomed out, the red dots become lines that crisscross Tasmania, becoming interwoven and tangled, especially around urban centres. The map, and the 59,990 reports of roadkill, are the results of data collected by the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program (STDP) through the Roadkill TAS smartphone app, launched in July 2018 by the Tasmanian government. The trial, which concluded in August 2021, was meant to ""assess whether citizen science data collected through this approach could usefully inform roadkill mitigation approaches"". People reporting roadkill via the app were able to submit notes with their data. In these, the despair of those witnessing the last moments of wildlife is palpable. At least 114 Tasmanian devils have been killed in the last year on a rural road in Tasmania's north-west. Locals say their calls for action appear to be falling on deaf ears. In one report, the witness wrote of a ""one-year-old male pademelon"" with 'visible bones and facial injury"". ""Very sad as people really shouldn't be driving over 20-30k on this tiny joining street but we frequently see people going at 40-50k, it's alarming,"" the anonymous report reads. In another report, about a red-necked wallaby, the witness writes ""couldn't stop. This is a very dangerous road for wildlife"". Another notes ""three animals mown down on one 20-metre stretch of road. Council refuses to enforce dirt road or after dark speed limits!"" One entry reads ""five animals all together by road, I moved skulls together to show the number of animals"". Other reports betray little emotion, simply stating what was seen. ""Female with wide pouch, but no joey,"" reads one, while another notes ""male, his face was very messed up"". The reports, which include quolls, pademelons, tawny frogmouths, hawks, wallabies, little penguins, Tasmanian devils, possums, potoroos, bandicoots, echidnas, platypuses, also note babies are often found killed or injured with their parent. ""Joey in pouch, unviable"", one entry reads. Another account notes a dead ""female"" animal, with ""pouch full of pink young"". The data collated by the app and other sources over several years found almost 37,000 red-necked wallabies were logged, followed by 11,000 brushtail possums and 4,700 Tasmanian pademelons. Just under 950 Tasmanian devils were also reported, a concerning figure for an endangered animal population. President of the Tamar Valley Roadkill Initiative Bruce George said Tasmanians needed to abandon the idea that roadkill is just a normal part of life. ""Many people believe that we have grown up with roadkill and the apparent apathy displayed is because people are conditioned to living with it,"" he said. ""Static signage needs to be replaced with signs that are aimed at speed reduction showing a vehicle's approaching speed. Maybe we could go further and make lower speeds in wildlife corridors enforceable. I think road design also plays a part. ""I have heard many criticisms from tourists expressing their shock at the level of roadkill in this state. ""On a half-a-kilometre stretch of a 60kph straight road in front of our accommodation we counted 24 wallaby carcasses over the Christmas break alone — that's appalling."" Artist and registered wildlife carer Ruth Waterhouse said roads covered in carcasses had become ""normalised, accepted"". ""It shouldn't be, it really shouldn't be."" Ms Waterhouse is part of Wildlife and Community Together, a newly formed group ""passionate about and committed to making Tasmania's roads and communities a safer place"". ""It's just like-minded people that want to make a difference,"" she said. The group states ""many of us have spent hours, months, even years feeding and caring for orphaned joeys and injured animals. ""We've driven kilometres day after day to collect severely injured animals who may have suffered a fractured pelvis, or significant head trauma having spent the night lying in agony in a gutter, for example. ""They are the lucky ones, others suffer for days and die slowly and painfully, if they're not found or reported by a member of the community."" Tasmania's growing popularity as a destination meant ""people are flocking here because it's such a great place,"" Ms Waterhouse said. ""But that means more people on the roads, more subdivisions."" Although only comprising of 15 members, the group aims to ""work collaboratively with local community members, relevant stakeholders, councillors and our state government, to reduce their suffering on Tassie's roads"". New to Tasmania and to wildlife caring, Juleen Angove is now permanently on call to help. While individuals and community groups are often the ones tending to the dead and injured on the side of the road, the government says the things it could provide, such as fences and under road culverts, only offer ""variable"" efficacy. In the end, it says ""reducing roadkill is the responsibility of all road owners and road users"". In a statement, DPIPWE said it was ""investigating options for a new mobile app-based roadkill reporting system that will allow easy reporting of roadkill and streamlined upload to web-based mapping tools where the data will be available for anyone to interrogate"". Until then, the public can view the almost 60,000 entries of 2018 to 2021 roadkill reports at the Natural Values Atlas, after creating a free account.

153,Vaughan and Yvonne's home is crawling with acid-spitting crazy ants. And they're spreading to other parts of northern Australia,science,"  Yellow crazy ants spread into Townsville and parts of north-east Australia, as councils plead for funding Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Samantha Cocuzza plays with her two kids in their Townsville backyard, most of the time she has to hold her youngest off the ground. It's not the prickles, or even the heat — it's something far more sinister. As soon as her kids put their feet back on the grass, they're covered in an acid-spitting invasive ant species called yellow crazy ants. ""It's now at the point where they play outside in the yard, head in for a bath, and sometimes there are ants in the bath that come off the kids,"" Ms Cocuzza said. The ants are categorised as one of the worst invasive species in the world, capable of completely destroying ecosystems and making outdoor areas virtually unusable. The ants don't bite, but instead throw acid, which can burn the eyes and skin of people, and can blind and kill insects and small animals. While one or two of the ants are rarely a problem, the species tends to congregate in incredible numbers. They hold the world record for population density, with scientists recording 2000 of them per square metre. In Townsville, where Samantha and her family live, an outbreak has been growing for years, and it finally made its way to her backyard in November last year. She now has to spray the verandah regularly and sweep the ants away every day. ""And they've just multiplied,"" she said. ""I think we've gone from a couple to millions."" The ants are not just a nuisance. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, they are among the 100 worst invasive species in the world. On Christmas Island, off the coast of Western Australia, the ants have completely transformed the forest and decimated its famous red crab population. It's not known exactly where they came from, but it's thought either Africa or Asia. They were first detected in Australia in 1980 at Arnhem Land, although they were likely here much earlier. In 2001, they were found in Cairns, a few hundred kilometres north of Townsville. About $30 million of state and federal money has been thrown at righting the infestation in Cairns — with eradication possibly in sight. But so far, virtually no state or federal funding has been spent fighting the outbreak in Townsville. The job of repelling the tiny invaders is the responsibility of the Townsville City Council, and the two technical officers who work there. Yet their job also involves dealing with every other invasive species in the area including plants, pigs and deer. Councillor Maurie Soars said the city was at a crucial juncture. ""We're at the tipping [point] now,"" he said. ""Our experts here [are] telling us that we've really got to address it now. ""And if we do [that] we can have some serious impact on the spread."" The council said it wouldn't be able to stop the infestation, or even know exactly the full extent of the infestation, without significant funding from the state and federal governments. ""We are hoping that upper levels of government will start looking at it more seriously and then bring it in because if we don't stop it here, where are you going to stop it?"" Mr Soars said. Environmental charity The Invasive Species Council has assessed the situation in Townsville and is proposing a $27.6 million plan, which it thinks should be able to eradicate the ants. So far, the ants have been found at about seven locations in Townsville, covering an area of hundreds of hectares — but the council doesn't have the resources to determine exactly how big the spread is. A spokesman for federal environment minister Sussan Ley said the Morrison government has spent millions helping to control the outbreak near Cairns, but beyond that, it was the job of the state government and the council. A spokesman for the Queensland agriculture minister Mark Furner said councils have received money from the state government to help with the control efforts. ""The ants are a declared pest, so landholders have a general biosecurity obligation to manage such pests on their land,"" the spokesperson said. At Alligator Creek in Townsville, where Samantha lives, the ants are just 5km from Bowling Green National Park, where unique species such as the Mount Elliot crayfish and the Mount Elliot nursery frog live — species only found in this part of the world. In the right location, Ben Hoffman said the ants could completely transform an ecosystem. On Christmas Island, as well as killing millions of its famous red crabs, they also ate all the insects that fed on young plants, turning its sparse understorey into a dense bush. ""The transformation [there] is just so dramatic, it's unbelievable,"" Dr Hoffman said. ""You might as well be looking at two different island ecosystems where the ants are present in high abundance and where they're not."" He said there were a few elements that make them such incredible invaders. Firstly, while most ant species have separate colonies, each with one breeding ant called the queen, there's no limit to how many queens a yellow crazy ant nest can have — with all the queens making babies. ""There was one log I'm aware of where they just stopped counting after 1000 queens,"" Dr Hoffman said. And while different colonies of many ant species compete and even fight, yellow crazy ant colonies cooperate and combine. ""They basically cooperate as one massive nest that can cover tens to even hundreds of hectares,"" he said. ""It's almost the perfect storm of a species."" Once the infestation gets too big, eradicating it will be nearly impossible, according to Dr Hoffman. From that point, the Townsville infestation will almost certainly lead to outbreaks elsewhere around the country. That's no idle concern. Already, outbreaks in Darwin and on Hamilton Island are thought to have been seeded by the Townsville infestation. Just up the road from Samantha live Vaughan and Yvonne Benn, both in their 80s. They are too frail to fight the ants at the perimeter of their home, like Samantha does, and as a result, their home is crawling with yellow crazy ants. ""They crawl all over you,"" he says. ""You wouldn't think a little thing like that would have much acid to squirt out but apparently they do."" As they watch TV, the couple say they have to brush the ants off their arms. And they worry about what the ants will do to the environment around their home. ""They kill off the frogs and I believe they kill snakes,"" Vaughan said. In their old age, the pair are planning to move towards town where they can access more care. But they're worried they won't be able to sell their home. ""You'd hate a prospective buyer to come out and say 'oh what's all these ants,' you know? You don't want that."" So Vaughan and Yvonne need the ants gone. With the Townsville City Council now stretched beyond capacity fighting the infestation, local residents — with the help of environmental charity the Invasive Species Council — are taking matters into their own hands. On a Sunday afternoon, more than 20 local residents meet at the property of Ian and Frances Cotrell, who are also facing a severe infestation. The meeting is led by Bev Job from the Invasive Species Council, who is handing out supplies of bait, paid for by the charity, and explaining to the residents how to use it. But she is frank about the likelihood of getting much done without assistance from the state and federal governments. ""Unfortunately, it's been left too long,"" she said. ""Now it's been left up to the point where there are not enough resources in the Townsville City Council."" The residents are taken around Ian and Frances' backyard, and shown what the ants look like, and where to find them — which is not difficult, as they're everywhere. And according to Ben Hoffmann from the CSIRO, the infestation that's visible from the surface is just the ""tip of the iceberg"". ""The yellow crazy ant can be absolutely anywhere there's a cavity. ""So it's a hole in the ground, or it could be at the top of a coconut palm, for example. There's a lot of ants that you don't see. ""We don't really know the full extent of what issues will arise from yellow crazy ants. ""We only discover this when the ant gets into new locations [and] my personal preference is that we don't get to that stage.""

154,Physicists think time might not actually exist — surprising no-one who's lived through the last two years,science,"  Time might not exist, according to physicists and philosophers — but that’s okay Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Does time exist? The answer to this question may seem obvious: of course it does! Just look at a calendar or a clock. But developments in physics suggest the non-existence of time is an open possibility, and one that we should take seriously. How can that be, and what would it mean? It'll take a little while to explain, but don't worry: even if time doesn't exist, our lives will go on as usual. Physics is in crisis. For the past century or so, we have explained the universe with two wildly successful physical theories: general relativity and quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics describes how things work in the incredibly tiny world of particles and particle interactions. General relativity describes the big picture of gravity and how objects move. New measurements of a subatomic particle provide the strongest hint yet that the leading theory of quantum physics that explains our universe may be missing a fundamental element, scientists say. Both theories work extremely well in their own right, but the two are thought to conflict with one another. Though the exact nature of the conflict is controversial, scientists generally agree both theories need to be replaced with a new, more general theory. Physicists want to produce a theory of ""quantum gravity"" that replaces general relativity and quantum mechanics, while capturing the extraordinary success of both. Such a theory would explain how gravity's big picture works at the miniature scale of particles. It turns out that producing a theory of quantum gravity is extraordinarily difficult. One attempt to overcome the conflict between the two theories is string theory. String theory replaces particles with strings vibrating in as many as 11 dimensions. Year-round daylight saving time from 2023 is on the US legislative table. Here's why that's a bad idea. However, string theory faces a further difficulty. String theories provide a range of models that describe a universe broadly like our own, and they don't really make any clear predictions that can be tested by experiments to figure out which model is the right one. In the 1980s and 1990s, many physicists became dissatisfied with string theory and came up with a range of new mathematical approaches to quantum gravity. One of the most prominent of these is loop quantum gravity, which proposes that the fabric of space and time is made of a network of extremely small discrete chunks, or ""loops"". One of the remarkable aspects of loop quantum gravity is that it appears to eliminate time entirely. Loop quantum gravity is not alone in abolishing time: a number of other approaches also seem to remove time as a fundamental aspect of reality. So we know we need a new physical theory to explain the universe, and that this theory might not feature time. Suppose such a theory turns out to be correct. Would it follow that time does not exist? It's complicated, and it depends what we mean by exist. Theories of physics don't include any tables, chairs, or people, and yet we still accept that tables, chairs and people exist. Why? Because we assume that such things exist at a higher level than the level described by physics. We say that tables, for example, ""emerge"" from an underlying physics of particles whizzing around the universe. But while we have a pretty good sense of how a table might be made out of fundamental particles, we have no idea how time might be ""made out of"" something more fundamental. So unless we can come up with a good account of how time emerges, it is not clear we can simply assume time exists. Time might not exist at any level. Saying that time does not exist at any level is like saying that there are no tables at all. Trying to get by in a world without tables might be tough, but managing in a world without time seems positively disastrous. Every time physicists find a new particle, the Standard Model gets one step closer to becoming a Super Model. Our entire lives are built around time. We plan for the future, in light of what we know about the past. We hold people morally accountable for their past actions, with an eye to reprimanding them later on. We believe ourselves to be agents (entities that can do things) in part because we can plan to act in a way that will bring about changes in the future. But what's the point of acting to bring about a change in the future when, in a very real sense, there is no future to act for? What's the point of punishing someone for a past action, when there is no past and so, apparently, no such action? The discovery that time does not exist would seem to bring the entire world to a grinding halt. We would have no reason to get out of bed. There is a way out of the mess. While physics might eliminate time, it seems to leave causation intact: the sense in which one thing can bring about another. Perhaps what physics is telling us, then, is that causation and not time is the basic feature of our universe. If that's right, then agency can still survive. For it is possible to reconstruct a sense of agency entirely in causal terms. At least, that's what Kristie Miller, Jonathan Tallant and I argue in our new book. We suggest the discovery that time does not exist may have no direct impact on our lives, even while it propels physics into a new era.

155,"Long-living, but facing many dangers: Meet south-east Australia's freshwater turtle trio",science,"  Freshwater turtles of south-east Australia have hatched. Do you know your broad-shells from your long-necks? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A journey has just begun. It's a dangerous journey, with the threat of exotic predators, and perilous crossings. If the journey is successful it may take 70 years. So begins the life of an Australian freshwater turtle. Eastern long-necked turtles have just hatched along waterways in south-east Australia and you may spot them on the move. They are one of three freshwater turtle species that can be found in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. All three have feet, but they are all semi-aquatic as well. James Van Dyke, senior lecturer in biomedical sciences at La Trobe University, studies the conservation and ecology of turtles. He says the three species commonly found in south-eastern Australia are technically turtles even if many Australians call them tortoises. ""A lot of the freshwater turtles we have in Australia have feet, but they are webbed feet. They need that to be able to swim through the water,"" Dr Van Dyke said. ""They got the name 'tortoise' because a lot of them do walk on land on occasion, especially the long-necked turtles you see going overland sometimes. ""Either name is fine. We call them tortoises or turtles here in Australia."" Cats and foxes are killing more than 2.6 billion mammals, reptiles and birds every year in Australia, experts say. The eastern long-necked turtle (Chelodina longicollis) breeds from November to January and hatches about three months later. Murray short-necked turtles (Emydura macquarii) nest about the same time but tend to hatch a little earlier, while the broad-shelled turtles (Chelodina expansa) nest in autumn and most often hatch in spring or summer. Throughout their incubation, there is the threat of foxes. And that's just the beginning of the hazards they face over a life that can — with more than a little luck — span more than five decades. ""Foxes eat the eggs and nests. In some nesting areas you will just see a whole bunch of holes with shattered eggshells all over the place,"" Dr Van Dyke said. ""The other thing is adults get hit and killed on roads sometimes. They can live a long time so if you get just one killed when it's hit by a car that's a very important animal gone. ""Finally, there is the changes in the river flows, which can impact populations as well. ""They're not doing too well. Around the world they are among the most endangered groups of animals. ""Here in Australia they are in decline. Most of them aren't in terrible shape yet but they are definitely becoming rarer."" Turtles play an important role in keeping waterways clean, eating carrion such as dead fish and animals. They are able to survive well in poor-quality water so a waterway that should have turtles but doesn't is a sign things have gone seriously wrong. The wetter-than-average weather in south-eastern Australia over the past couple of years has given researchers some cause for optimism. That has been borne out in population surveys by volunteers. ""We almost never catch juvenile or hatchling turtles when we do our population surveys,"" Dr Van Dyke said. ""This year we've actually got some. We've got four or five. It doesn't sound like much but it's a lot more than we usually see."" There is a citizen-science project underway called One Million Turtles. Researchers are encouraging anyone with an interest in conservation to help count turtles using the TurtleSAT mobile phone app. ""Across all of Australia there are maybe 10-15 people working on turtles professionally, so we need all the help we can get,"" Dr Van Dyke said. ""Everyone out there spotting turtles can help tell us learn where they are common, and where they are not so common. ""If they tell us they can't find turtles where they should be, that also helps us. ""We're also about to start a project on the website trying to find the impact of foxes. ""People can participate in a nest predation experience. We will be providing instruction and training on protecting nests and helping turtles cross roads safely."" Citizen scientists will soon begin work to outsmart local foxes and fool them with fake turtle nests to protect hatchlings. As for rescuing turtles which appear to be heading away from the safety of a waterway, it can be frustrating, especially if they are on their way to an industrial or building site that may have once been close to a waterway. ""It's tricky, especially with eastern long-necks,"" Dr Van Dyke said. ""Those turtles can be pretty old, especially the big ones which can be 50 years old. ""It may remember there was a wetland where that industrial park is now. ""They wander over land long distances, up to 15 kilometres sometimes. If you try to move them in a different direction, they are stubborn animals. They'll keep wanting to go where they want to go. ""Sometimes you just have to let them do that. If you see them crossing the road, it's best to point them in the direction they were headed and move them to the other side."" This is the one you will most likely see crossing roads. They are carnivorous and will take any prey smaller than themselves. Adults weigh about 1 kilogram, with a shell length of about 200-250mm. Females tend to be bigger but the sexes are hard to tell apart. They have a black and tan belly and they also stink a little. Baby eastern long-necked turtles have bright orange markings on their underside. You may see them basking on a sunny day. They weigh 2-3kg with a shell length of up to 300mm. Short-necked turtles tend to eat a lot of green algae but will also eat anything dead. They are greenish in colour with lighter markings on their head and neck, and have a short neck and chunky head compared with others. The largest freshwater turtle in Australia. Can weigh up to 6 or 7kg, with a shell length about 450mm. Their necks can be up to a metre long when stretched out. Another carnivorous turtle, they will eat anything they can catch, including fish and yabbies. Broadshell turtles have distinctly flat heads.

156,"North Korean hackers target Axie Infinity game players in $US620m crypto heist, FBI says",science,"  North Korean hackers target Axie Infinity game players in $US620m crypto heist, FBI says Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog North Korean-tied hackers were responsible for a $US620 million cryptocurrency heist last month that targeted players of the popular Axie Infinity game, US authorities said Thursday. The hack was one of the biggest to hit the crypto world, raising questions about security in an industry that only recently burst into the mainstream. Last month's theft from the makers of Axie Infinity — a game where players can earn crypto through game play or trading their avatars — came just weeks after thieves made off with around $US320 million in a similar attack. ""Through our investigations we were able to confirm Lazarus Group and APT38, cyber actors associated with [North Korea], are responsible for the theft,"" the FBI said in a statement. Lazarus Group gained notoriety in 2014 when it was accused of hacking into Sony Pictures Entertainment as revenge for The Interview, a satirical film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. North Korea's cyber-program dates back to at least the mid-1990s, but has since grown to a 6,000-strong cyber-warfare unit, known as Bureau 121, that operates from several countries including Belarus, China, India, Malaysia and Russia, according to a 2020 US military report. John Bambenek, a threat analyst with digital security firm Netenrich, said North Korea is ""unique"" in employing groups dedicated to cryptocurrency theft. ""As North Korea is highly sanctioned, cryptocurrency thefts are also a national security interest for them,"" he said. North Korean hackers stole around $US400 million-worth of cryptocurrency through cyber attacks on digital currency outlets last year, blockchain data platform Chainalysis said in January. In the case of the Axie Infinity heist, attackers exploited weaknesses in the set-up put in place by the Vietnam-based firm behind the game, Sky Mavis. The company had to solve a problem: the ethereum blockchain, where transactions in the ether cryptocurrency are logged, is relatively slow and expensive to use. To allow Axie Infinity players to buy and sell at speed, the firm created an in-game currency and a sidechain with a bridge to the main ethereum blockchain. The result was faster and cheaper, but ultimately less secure. The attack targeting its blockchain netted 173,600 ether and $US25.5 million-worth of stablecoin, a digital asset pegged to the US dollar.

157,Robots have shown scientists the deep shelf reefs off Tasmania — and what was found has disturbed experts,science,"  Bleached sea sponges found in deeper reefs off Tasmania Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A study by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) has found bleaching in sea sponges for the first time in Tasmanian waters — and scientists fear it could be another sign we are reaching a ""tipping point: in the warming of the Earth. Reports of marine die-offs and bleaching are common in coral reefs and other shallow ecosystems, but evidence of bleaching in deeper temperate waters off Tasmania's east coast has just been discovered. Between shallow, well-lit waters and dark, deeper parts of the ocean marine researchers have found bleaching in the 'twilight zone', known in scientific terms as the mesophotic zone. While light is still able to penetrate depths over 30 metres below the ocean's surface, the mesophotic zone is home to thriving communities of coral, sponges and red algae and is vital to the ecology of marine life. From 2009 to 2017, IMAS researchers monitored areas within the Flinders, Freycinet and Huon Marine Parks to determine the impact heatwaves and extreme weather events are having on the region. Using robotic and remotely operated vehicles to collect images and videos, lead author Dr Nick Perkins said it's the first time deep shelf reefs have been surveyed. ""We're still, in some ways, getting a grip on what's down there, what's happening and what might happen through time."" However, something that did catch the attention of researchers but was not properly examined in the last round of surveys was disruption to the reproductive output of small sponge species. ""What we've seen with the size structure of the sponge through time is [that] no new small sponges [have] come in over the time period where bleaching has occurred."" While the link between bleaching and the lack of sponge cup reproduction requires further research, there is some good news, he said. A project to save Tasmania's giant kelp forests from extinction has seen success with new forests beginning to grow. According to Dr Perkins, we're yet to see a mass die-off of cup sponges, unlike 95 per cent of Tasmania's kelp forests which have been wiped out. ""It doesn't appear that there's been mass mortality [but that's] definitely one of the things we'll be looking at with the latest round of surveys."" IMAS Associate Professor Neville Barrett has spent two decades researching Australia's temperate reef systems. He said while many people are familiar with the bleaching of shallow reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef off Queensland's east coast, there was little understanding of what's happening in areas further off shore. ""What [the study] is telling us is that this warming climate that we're seeing in-shore is also found further across the continental shelf."" While it's probable that warming ocean temperatures are impacting deeper marine life, Professor Barrett said the study was the first of its kind to gather hard evidence. ""These deeper reefs are known to be biodiverse zones and could contain species not yet described by science. We still know very little about these systems below diving depths — how they function and how they may respond to climate change,"" he said. Want even more science, health and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. ""The main thing with the greater number of heatwaves is simply that the base temperature that we're operating from has increased. ""In the last 40 years now, we've gone up more than an average of 2 degrees Celsius from our annual average in this region. ""We're now starting to reach that tipping point where we're seeing this kind of bleaching... that wouldn't have happened previously.""

158,"When Vernie plays video games in Melbourne, his fans around the world watch. He's part of a rising trend",science," Science From Fortnite to Elden Ring, Twitch streaming is booming. So why do people like to watch others play games? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Most nights, when Vernie ""BlueRukus"" Valentos boots up the PlayStation in his home in Western Melbourne, he's joined by a few dozen online spectators who have gathered to chat and watch him play. They come from all over, teenagers and the middle-aged, and have been doing so for years. For the 28-year-old, they appear as names and voices in the chat box on Twitch, the platform that streams his games to the world. One man, Justinus, is a 23-year-old office worker in Lithuania who's never been to Australia. He's been a Vernie regular for five years. ""I don't know why he comes back. He's awesome. He's one of the greatest people in the community,"" Vernie said. ""Everyday I find it crazy that my big head is on a screen somewhere in Lithuania."" Why Justinus watches Vernie play the football game FIFA is part of a deeper mystery: why do people like to watch others play video games? This is a question with big implications. Gaming video content (GVC) is booming in popularity, with millions broadcasting themselves playing to an eager, mostly young global audience. In 2021, more than 1.3 trillion minutes (yep, that's a mind-boggling 25,000 centuries) of GVC were watched on Twitch, the most popular platform. In Australia, video games are more popular than free-to-air TV, thanks largely to the rise of streaming during the pandemic. Even if you're not a participant, you may have noticed this phenomenon: your children huddled about screens, attentively watching, rather than playing, Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto. Bond University's Jeff Brand has been following the popularity of video games for the past two decades. The latest survey, conducted in 2020 and 2021, shows that 17 million Australians play video games for an average of just under 1.5 hours per day, and that most play socially rather than alone. Games were the second-most dominant form of entertainment in Australian homes in 2020 and 2021, behind streaming TV and movies. About half of adult players watch live streams or recordings of others playing video games, up from about 20 per cent in 2012, Professor Brand said. Reasons given for watching others play games include: That is, the same reasons many would give for watching Lionel Messi play football, or Buddy Franklin AFL. ""They're looking for authentic players or gamers — people who are really great at something, who have been embedded in culture from an early age and now in adulthood have reached a very high level."" ""They’re looking for the real gamer."" But witnessing greatness only explains some of the appeal of watching others play games: for every professional gamer with a legion of viewers, there's thousands of small ""community streamers"". For Vernie, who works full-time in a nursing agency, streaming isn't about winning competitions or having the largest audience, but about engaging with a core group of about 100 loyal fans. ""In a general sense, people watch streamers because they like the person they're watching, or because they want to get better at the game,"" he said. ""I like to watch people that I like. They could be not playing a game. They could be watching grass grow and I'd still watch them."" When a new viewer joins his stream, Vernie has only a moment to catch their attention and make them feel at home. ""You either have them for life or they're gone forever,"" he said. Tyler Smith, 19, is a Gold Coast bartender who streams FIFA up to 25 hours a week and wants to become a Twitch star. Most nights, fewer than 10 watch his stream. Recently, one of his viewers, who he'd never met offline, opened up to him in private about going through a break-up. ""They don't know me, but they feel comfortable enough to share this information,"" he said. ""That can be daunting, but I'm always there to support any viewers."" Stories like this show the rise of streaming is about more than dollar figures, brand endorsements and celebrity gamers — it's also about new ways, and places, for people to connect. The American urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg introduced the concept of the ""third place"" in the 1980s to explain the importance we invest in places like churches, cafes, clubs and pubs. The ""first place"" is the home, which has obligations, the ""second place"" is the workplace, which has strict rules. ""The third place is where we go for conviviality — where we can be part of something with mates and people understand our own bizarre uniqueness,"" Professor Brand said. ""Those third places used to be pubs and surf life saving clubs, and maybe they still are, but if COVID taught us anything it's that there's other options."" It's no surprise, he said, that football, the unifying ""world game"", should be a popular way to come together online. FIFA is often among the top 10 most watched games on Twitch. In Lithuania, due to the time difference with Australia, Vernie is often up late and streaming when Justinus comes home from work. ""I like to watch streams while I play myself,"" Justinus said. ""I wouldn't say it's lonely, but it's a bit of a distraction — some listen to podcasts, streaming is in a way like that. ""You can hear somebody talk, whilst you can interact yourself. ""If somebody is lonely while playing something, they can always chat with the streamers, who will reply."" But the parallels between watching video games and spectating at the football, or ducking down to the pub, only go so far: the big difference is that video games are exploiting better ways of hooking our attention as technology and our understanding of the brain evolves. Kirsten Oberprieler is a Canberra-based expert on gamification, or the application of game mechanics and design to engage users. ""As technology is emerging, there are more and more opportunities to create what we call juicy experiences,"" she said. ""Technology allows us to create increasingly juicy experiences that have sound, motion, haptic feedback, which are the things that make them really engaging."" A 2017 study in Finland looked at why people chose to watch others play video games and identified the motivations mentioned above, such as to improve gameplay and interact with like-minded others. But the strongest motivator, by far, was found to be the release of tension. Games are designed to provide a platform for escapism and diversion from day-to-day lives, Dr Oberprieler said. ""The danger is about the game world or the virtual world being more more juicy than the real world in some ways,"" she said. ""And that's where you get people going, 'Wow, that game was so stimulating, I could fly and do all these things, and in the real world, I have all these constraints.'"" Dr Oberprieler envisions a future where technologies like virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), the emergence of vast online metaverses, and the gamification of everyday experiences (such as work and learning) blur the line between the game world and the ""real world"". ""We as designers are much smarter at creating engaging experiences,"" she said. ""The game world is designed to reward me every step of the way, whereas the real world is a little bit harder."" Given this, it's no wonder big tech companies are scrambling to acquire best-selling video game franchises — and the companies that made them. In January, Microsoft announced it would buy Activision Blizzard — which owns Call of Duty — for $US68.7 billion ($96 billion). Publisher Take-Two acquired social game pioneer Zynga (maker of games like FarmVille and Words With Friends) for $18 billion. And Sony snapped up Bungie — the creator of Halo — for $5 billion. The bemused reaction of parents seeing their children watch games rather than play them may come down to a lack of awareness of how much games have changed since their own glory days, when titles like Red Alert and Mario Kart ruled PCs and consoles. A massive data breach has exposed the earnings of thousands of Twitch streamers. So how do you make millions from playing computer games? For the first few decades of gaming, Professor Brand said, the whole point was that they were something you could play, rather than just watch. ""It went from passively viewing TV to engaging and playing video games,"" he said. Now, the whole point is you can watch them, not just play. ""Older people might think that's kind of silly. They might think that games are inherently interactive. ""The whole point is to play them. Why would you go back around? ""The point of spectating is that it extends and deepens the culture of gaming."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

159,How to keep your pretty multi-coloured plants alive,science,"  Multi-coloured plants are suddenly a home decor 'must-have'. Here's how to keep them alive Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Fads and fashion have always influenced the plants we keep. And so it is with variegated plants, which have become very popular with indoor plant enthusiasts these days. Variegated plants possess multiple colours — typically on their leaves, but in some cases on stems, flowers and fruit. Their patterns include stripes, dots, edges and patches. They're usually green with either white or yellow, but can also feature red, pink, silver and other colours. Variegated plants can divide opinion. I recall a great aunt telling me many years ago of her great fondness for the variegated Aspidistra elatior growing her garden. But I've also heard gardeners and garden designers dismiss variegated foliage because it didn't fit with their design or colour themes. Now, it seems indoor variegated plants are considered a ""must-have"" home decor accessory. But before you rush out and buy one, make sure you know how to keep it happy. Most plant species are entirely green but occasionally a variegated individual arises. Some catch the eye of a dedicated plant collector or nursery worker and become a popular variety. Plant variegation can occur for several reasons. In some plants, such as the flowers of tulips, it's due to a viral infection. The resulting streaks of different colours may be cursed or valued depending on the aesthetic effect. Others plants, such as those in the genus coleus, are naturally patterned. Groups of cells produce different colour combinations, causing leaves to grow with attractive markings. Plant variegations can also arise from genetic mutation. When growing variegated plants, it's important to understand how the various colours affect the way it functions. The green part of plants contains chlorophyll, a pigment essential for photosynthesis. (Photosynthesis, of course, is the process by which the leaves convert sunlight into oxygen and carbohydrate that provides energy for plants to grow.) In variegated plants, white parts of leaves do not contain chlorophyll and so do not photosynthesise. Yellow parts of leaves can help send energy to the chlorophyll, but can't perform photosynthesis on their own. The same goes for some red, orange and pink patches of tissue. But all cells in the leaf — green or not — use the plant's energy. That means variegated plants are less efficient energy producers than their all-green counterparts, which causes them to grow more slowly. Some plants have mutated into albinos containing no chlorophyll. These normally die within a few days or weeks of germination. It's no coincidence many popular indoor plants — such as coleus, philodendrons, monsteras, dracaenas and calatheas — are variegated. Because they're usually far less vigorous than all-green versions of the species, they won't be pushing against the ceiling within weeks. The decorative colour and pattern of a variegated indoor plant is an added bonus. Variegated plants can take longer than others to reach a size considered appropriate for sale at a nursery, so may be comparatively more expensive. But there are ways to protect your variegated investment. First, watch out for ""reversion"". This can occur when a variegated plant sends up an all-green shoot. The shoot will grow fast compared to the variegated parts and can eventually take over, causing the whole plant to revert to green. To avoid this, vigilantly remove any green shoots before they get big. You don't want variegated plants quickly outgrowing their space, but remember they're low on chlorophyll and so need good light. And like any indoor plant, ensure its leaves are kept free of fine dust and you don't give it too much, or too little, water. The popularity of indoor variegated plants will almost certainly lead to greater use outdoors. Their slow-growing nature means outdoor variegated plants are usually much less likely to be ""weedy"" and spread where they're not wanted. Through a bee's eyes, blue flowers are more common than you'd think — and they could be used to monitor environmental health. This can be an advantage if you've avoided planting a species because it will take over the garden. The variegated versions of pittosporum, ficus and nerium oleander, for example, are far less intent on global domination than their all-green counterparts. When planting a variegated plant outdoors, watch that it doesn't become shaded by other quicker-growing plants. Many variegated plants already struggle to photosynthesise sufficiently. A bit of extra shade can damage or even kill them. So ensure they get enough light — and every so often give them a hand by trimming back nearby plants. Variegated plants are having their moment in the sun. But their interesting biology is always in fashion! These plants can brighten up your indoor space and provide attractive colour and pattern in the garden. By learning about how variegated plants function and considering their special requirements, you can enjoy them for years to come. Gregory Moore is a doctor of botany at the University of Melbourne.

160,Elon Musk makes 'best and final' offer to buy Twitter for $58 billion,science,"  Elon Musk offers to buy Twitter for $58 billion, says it needs 'transformation' Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Billionaire Elon Musk has offered to buy Twitter for about $US43 billion ($58 billion), just days after rejecting a seat on the social media company's board. Mr Musk's offer price of $US54.20 ($72.87) per share was disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday. It represents a 38 per cent premium to Twitter's April 1 close, the last trading day before the Tesla CEO's more than 9 per cent stake — which makes him the company's biggest shareholder — was made public. The 50-year-old has more than 80 million followers on the microblogging website. Twitter's shares jumped 12 per cent in pre-market trading. ""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"" Mr Musk says in the filing. Elon Musk spent $4 billion on Twitter shares, publicly criticised the company, and then declined a seat on the board. What just happened? ""However, since making my investment I now realise the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,"" he said in a letter to Twitter chairman Bret Taylor. ""My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,"" Mr Musk said. Earlier this week, Mr Musk said he had abandoned a plan to join Twitter's board, just as his tenure was about to start. Taking the board seat would have prevented him from a possible takeover of the company.

161,Winegrowers fear smoke taint will ruin entire vintage as fires leave bad aftertaste,science," ABC Rural Victorian winegrowers fear smoke from planned burns will taint entire vintage Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog John and Patrice O'Shea have been blessed with near-perfect autumn weather in their vineyard in Central Victoria's Macedon Ranges, but three weeks ago it looked a little different. In the lead-up to vintage, the small-scale growers said a planned burn next door by Forest Fire Management resulted in smoke lingering in their crop for days. Now, they are worried their grapes will be tainted and become useless, just before harvest. ""John came in in a state of high agitation because we were engulfed in smoke, which came as quite a surprise,"" Mrs O'Shea said. ""I totally get that they have to burn, that's understandable but, with a little bit of consultation, maybe they could have pushed it back until after Easter or something,"" Mr O'Shea said. Just before harvest, the skin of the wine grape is at its thinnest and is extremely vulnerable to smoke as it can penetrate the skin. Entire crops have been lost to smoke taint in previous years because of large bushfires and planned burns. Some producers have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in value in a single day. Mornington Peninsula Vignerons Association chief executive Olivia Barrie said such smoke taint had been an issue for years. ""There has certainly been years with big smoke events when the smoke has come at a particular time, when smoke has settled and not moved – it can be devastating to a grapevine crop,"" Ms Barrie said. And it's not just planned burns affecting harvest, burn-offs by private landholders can also be damaging. ""I think it's important for people in the region to realise what point we're at with our harvest, and for them to be aware of their neighbour and look over their fence before they strike a match."" Ms Barrie said there needed to be better lines of communication between growers, landowners and Forest Fire Management, which includes staff from Parks Victoria, VicForests, Melbourne Water and the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. ""We really understand that they've got windows that they have to operate to, but so do we,"" she said. ""When a grape's ready, a grape's ready. That's immovable. ""We've only got one harvest a year, we've got one shot at vintage every year, and so it's really important that we try and keep that safe."" Forest Fire Management said it consulted with winegrowers and other community groups across Victoria about timing the fires and alleviating the effects of smoke, but said there were only a handful of days in a year that were suitable for burns. It said ultimately, mitigating the risks of large bushfires was its main concern. Deputy Chief Fire Officer Tamara Beckett said there was a natural tension between many groups in the community around timed burns in autumn. ""We can't do it too early in summer because usually it's too hot and too dry. It's not safe,"" she said. ""By the time we get into early May or even late April in some parts of the state, it's simply too wet. ""We know that the biggest impact to businesses. to the economy and to wine is large-scale bushfires, where smoke can linger not just for a day or two, but for many weeks or sometimes months."" But in autumn, time is of the essence for wine growers. The O'Shea family is now waiting nervously to see if there will be a return on the fruits of their labour. ""We're halfway through fermentation, so we won't really know until it's finished and the grapes are pressed,"" Mr O'Shea said. ""I think it's always about learning. ""What I'd like to think is that FFM would acknowledge that this mightn't be perfect, and they might just genuinely consult and wait a couple of weeks.""

162,NT and federal governments sign major deal to accelerate fracking in the Beetaloo Basin,science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Commonwealth and Northern Territory governments have signed a major deal to further speed up fracking and increase energy supply from a giant underground gas field in the remote NT. Two days before going into caretaker mode ahead of the election, the federal government signed off on the joint $872 million deal to accelerate gas production in the Beetaloo Basin, about 500 kilometres south-east of Darwin. As part of the agreement, the federal government said it would contribute $660 million and the NT government has allocated $212 million, with plans to boost gas supply from the NT to Australia's east coast by 2024. The deal pulls together more than $550 million in already announced projects to boost the Northern Territory's renewable energy supply and security, as well as investing in technologies such as carbon capture and storage. It also includes $300 million to support the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen, as part of a $1.5 billion plan for Darwin's Middle Arm precinct revealed in the latest federal budget. It marks the latest push by the federal government to accelerate fracking — a controversial drilling technique — in the Beetaloo Basin, under its plans for a gas-led recovery out of the coronavirus pandemic. It follows previous funding intended to speed up development in the area, including money for road upgrades and subsidies for gas companies' exploration activities, and builds on recently promised federal support for new port facilities in Darwin Harbour. Exploration is currently underway to frack the Beetaloo Basin, and the government has said the new supply target will reflect the proven findings of that exploration. Politicians, environmentalists, traditional owners and gas company representatives have arrived in Darwin for a public hearing into the Beetaloo Basin. In a statement, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the agreement was ""about seizing the opportunities in the Territory to deliver a stronger economy and a stronger future, by investing in a new hydrogen industry and the Beetaloo to grow jobs and the local economy"". ""This is also about ensuring households, businesses, and industries in the territory get a fair deal on energy, and more affordable, reliable power,"" he said. Speaking on ABC Radio Darwin this morning, NT Environment Minister Eva Lawler said the NT government had been negotiating the deal with the Commonwealth for nearly two years. ""We literally have been negotiating tooth and nail and it came down to the wire but we did get a better deal for the Northern Territory,"" she said. Ms Lawler said the NT government has been ""very clear about"" supporting the onshore oil and gas industry, provided all 135 recommendations outlined in the Pepper Inquiry were implemented. Among those commitments is Recommendation 9.8, which states that: ""both the NT and Australian governments must seek to ensure there is no net increase in the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions emitted in Australia from any onshore shale gas produced in the NT"". This commitment is of particular concern to scientists and environmental groups, who fear fracking will fast-track the warming effects of climate change. Ms Lawler said ""we have to make sure that those 135 recommendations are comprehensively implemented, so that's the work that's absolutely being pushed ahead"". ""Recommendation 9.8 was part of that agreement as well, making sure that the proponents and the federal government adhere to our net zero 2050 target,"" she said. Environment Centre NT co-director Dr Kirsty Howey said the deal failed to address Recommendation 9.8 of the Pepper Inquiry, describing it as ""profoundly disappointing"". ""We thought it would contain the answer to a fundamental question — and a promise made to Territorians — which was: 'How are the huge emissions that will be generated from fracking the Beetaloo Basin going to be offset?',"" she said. ""Instead of seeing an answer on that, what we see is more money shovelled straight to the fossil fuel industry. It's really just a form of corporate welfare."" Some analysts believe the demand for LNG will grow, particularly in South-East Asia, and it would be needed as a backup for renewable energy sources. However Bruce Robertson, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy, Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), has questioned its long-term economic viability. ""We do need the existing gas power plants we have in the national electricity market, there's just no doubt about that,"" he said. ""We need those plants to stay open. Do we need more gas to furnish more renewables? We've seen renewables go from virtually nothing to 35 per cent of the national electricity market, and we've seen gas over that time period decline. ""They [governments] know that the customers for LNG, that is, our customers in Asia, are not signing long-term contracts,"" he said. Mr Robertson said Japan — one of Australia's biggest natural gas customers, along with China — had a program to cut the use of LNG in its power system by 50 per cent by 2030. ""We're looking at a massive decline in demand out of Japan,"" he said. The invasion of Ukraine has also disrupted LNG projects in Russia, affecting investment and supply.

163,A comet that dwarfs the ACT is heading our way and NASA says it's the largest ever seen ,science,"  NASA's Hubble telescope detects largest comet nucleus ever found Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Astronomers say they have seen the largest comet nucleus ever thanks to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. This luminous blue glow — named Comet C/2014 UN271 — was discovered by astronomers Pedro Bernardinelli and Gary Bernstein using archival images from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The comet has been observed since 2010, when it was 4.8 billion kilometres away from the sun, and has been studied since. According to NASA, its estimated diameter is approximately 85 miles or 137km across, making it larger than the ACT. The comet's nucleus is about 50 times larger than that of most comets. Its mass is estimated to be a staggering 450 trillion tonnes — a hundred thousand times greater than the mass of a typical comet found much closer to the Sun. A professor of planetary science and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, David Jewitt, said in a statement: ""This comet is literally the tip of the iceberg for many thousands of comets that are too faint to see in the more distant parts of the solar system. ""We've always suspected this comet had to be big because it is so bright at such a large distance. Now we confirm it is,"" he added. Professor Jewitt co-authored a recent study of the comet in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, along with lead author Man-To Hui from Macau University of Science and Technology. According to NASA, the comet is currently too far away for its nucleus to be distinguished by Hubble. The challenge in measuring the size of the comet was distinguishing its nucleus from the huge, dusty coma enveloping it — a cloud of gases that surrounds the nucleus of a comet. But what the Hubble data did reveal was a bright spike of light at the nucleus's location. Dr Hui and his team made a computer model of the surrounding coma and adjusted it to fit the Hubble images. Then, they removed the glow of the coma, revealing its starlike nucleus. Don't worry, we're not about to be in a real-life version of the film Don't Look Up. The comet is travelling at 35,400 kilometres per hour from the edge of the solar system. But NASA has assured us it will never get closer than 1.6 billion kilometres away from the Sun, which won't be until 2031.

164,'The dog whistler' shows off his skills at the Royal Easter Show,science," ABC Rural Working dog whistling demonstration stuns crowd at Sydney's Royal Easter Show Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Murray Wilkinson has developed his own language of whistles to control his working dogs and it's been put on display at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. Inspired by a working dog demonstration he watched at the show as a child, Mr Wilkinson was determined to learn the art of dog whistling. ""I came to the show with my nan and pop and pretty much followed the [working dog] show from show to show,"" he says. ""I hardly went and saw any of the rides or anything else, I was just that fascinated with his [the trainer's] dogs."" Now Mr Wilkinson has his own performance at the event, which draws in crowds of up to 200 people at a time. ""I've been working some cattle out in the main arena and a few sheep as well,"" he says. ""It just gives a little insight as to what we do day to day on the farm. ""The kids just love seeing the dogs, especially when I get them to jump up on the [livestock's] backs or get them to bark and make some noise."" Perhaps the most fascinating part of Mr Wilkinson's performance is his ability to control his dogs with whistles. ""[Other trainers] do use the whistles [but] people don't use all different ones probably like I do,"" he says. Mr Wilkinson has different whistle combinations for different dogs, which direct them to sit, go left, go right, or run a ring. He says it is a process to teach them the unique commands. ""We try and have all basic manners at a young age like sitting and waiting for me to go first through a gate or something,"" he says. ""And then we introduce them to stock and it's all just word association. ""So when they're doing an action, we'll put a word to it and we'll just continually do that over and over and over until it becomes second nature. ""I always say that training is just habits formed through repetition."" Mr Wilkinson has brought along 11 dogs to the show but has 21 dogs in total, 20 of those are border collies and just one is a kelpie. He uses them to help muster livestock on his 34,000-hectare property at Ellerston, east of Scone in New South Wales. ""We've got 14,000 cows, 3,000 sheep and 2,000 goats on the farm so [the dogs have] got a hell of a job to do all the time,"" he says. Mr Wilkinson takes out up to six dogs at a time on the property, to help muster stock. ""They make things so much easier because they can get into spots where we can't … and we can guide stock around and they just keep them calm,"" he says. ""We need to be able to control them all using different commands."" Mr Wilkinson breeds his dogs mainly for his own use, but occasionally will sell them too. ""I sold one actually the [other] day for $15,000 and he's a pretty handy dog,"" he says. ""Some of these dogs that I use in the demo I'd probably want anywhere from $20,000 to $30,000 for them. ""They're a great asset to have and they're definitely very valuable at the end of the day.""

I've never seen another instance where this has happened."" Another item of interest is an original fragment from the rocket that launched the USSR's Sputnik 1 into space on October 4, 1957, marking the start of the space race. It's the only known fragment in private hands and is estimated to sell for between $US80,000 to $US120,000. Also hitting the auction block is a 1969 map of the Moon signed by 15 astronauts, including Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, along with former president Richard Nixon and German-American aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun. Its estimated sale price is $US20,000 to $US30,000. ""One thing about a lot of these items is they really do connect people with the events and especially like the Moon does,"" Mr Stackhouse said.

166,"Exotic pest detected near Darwin for first time, worrying mango growers",science," ABC Rural Mango shoot looper pest detected in NT for first time, putting fruit industry on alert Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An exotic plant pest known as mango shoot looper has been officially detected in the Northern Territory for the first time, putting the region's mango industry on alert. The moth species, originally from Asia, had not been found in Australia until a detection in Queensland in September. When in its caterpillar form, mango shoot loopers feed on mango tree leaves, shoots, flowers, and immature fruit. The pest was found on a farm in the Darwin rural area in late March, with DNA sequencing confirming the species in April. Northern Territory senior principal entomologist Brian Thistleton told ABC Rural the mango shoot looper may have been in the region for a while. ""We had all sorts of reports of increased [pest] activity … the problem is we couldn't actually call it until we got a specimen and a confirmed identification,"" Dr Thistleton said. He said damage by mango shoot loopers in Queensland had not been ""as severe"" as first thought. ""I've been told by entomologists in Queensland that [the damage] is aggregated into certain places, not right through the orchard. You get little spots with the shoot looper,"" he said. ""It's a pest mainly at flowering time … it attacks the flowers, so it will be an issue for fruit set."" Mango shoot loopers also attack lychee trees, but there are no commercial lychee growers in the NT. The Australian Mango Industry Association moved quickly to inform NT growers about the pest and insecticides available to growers. NT Farmers Association chief executive Paul Burke said the organisation's staff had been raising awareness about the pest. ""We will continue to closely work with the Department of Industry's biosecurity team to safeguard the industry from the mango shoot looper threat,"" he said. ""In the interests of Territory farmers and the economy, it is essential that biosecurity threats such as mango shoot looper are rapidly identified and managed. ""If mango shoot looper is not effectively managed, it will potentially reduce farmers' profits and the growth of the industry in the Territory."" Mango shoot looper is an emergency plant pest. If you suspect an infestation, contact the Exotic Plant Pest Hotline on 1800 084 881.

167,'Twitter in chaos mode': Could Elon Musk's Twitter investment be the start of something bigger?,science," Science Elon Musk spent $4 billion on Twitter shares and then declined a seat on the board. So what's going on? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog News earlier this week that Elon Musk had declined a seat on the Twitter board after becoming the company's largest shareholder left many people wondering: What was that all about? Many had reasonably assumed that the outspoken multi-billionaire and Twitter pundit had bought the shares expressly to gain a board seat and exert control over the company. Mr Musk and supporters have previously criticised Twitter's policy of banning trolls and moderating content, on the grounds it was blocking ""free speech"". Former Twitter shareholders sue Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his recent investment in the social media company, saying they missed out on its rising stock price because he failed to declare his stake on time. In the days since the news broke, theories have flowed thick and fast: the Tesla boss didn't want to submit to a police background check, or has a larger galaxy-brain strategy we cannot yet comprehend. Some Twitter employees, meanwhile, have breathed a public sigh of relief at the news of Mr Musk's decision. ""I've kept quiet since the announcement because I wanted to give Twitter leadership a chance to do right by its employees, and they did,"" one senior employee tweeted. ""Musk's immediate chilling effect was something that bothered me significantly. ""Twitter has a beautiful culture of hilarious constructive criticism, and I saw that go silent because of his minions attacking employees."" Ten days on from the news that Mr Musk had acquired a large chunk of Twitter, the dust is beginning to settle. What just happened? First up, here's a brief timeline of events: In the aftermath of the news Mr Musk had declined a board seat, several leading, overlapping theories have emerged: Many have pointed out that Mr Musk, who appears to enjoy public controversy and attention, and whose company Tesla is now the subject of the largest racial discrimination lawsuit ever brought by California, would hardly shy away from a routine background check. But a hostile takeover is considered a serious prospect by market observers. US analyst Dan Ives, from Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to clients earlier this week that the most likely outcome was a ""Game of Thrones battle"" between Twitter and Mr Musk: ""This now goes from a Cinderella story with Musk joining the Twitter Board and keeping his stake under 14.9 per cent helping move Twitter strategically forward to likely a ‘Game of Thrones’ battle between Musk and Twitter with the high likelihood that Elon takes a more hostile stance towards Twitter and further builds his active stake in the company."" But it's not the only option, he added. Mr Musk could simply hang on to the stock he already has and continue to campaign for changes to Twitter — unencumbered by fiduciary duty. As the largest shareholder, he'd be hard to ignore. Jean Burgess, a digital media expert at QUT's Digital Media Research Centre, said the theory that Mr Musk didn't want to take on the fiduciary duties of a board member, was the most likely. ""It's unlikely that Musk's ambitions for Twitter as a platform ... are compatible with the fiduciary responsibilities of a board member,"" she said. ""His behaviour on Twitter ... frames him more as a shadow rogue CEO than a normal board member."" She pointed out there were also questions around whether Mr Musk breached the Security and Exchange Commissions' (SEC) rules by not informing the markets that he had surpassed a 5 per cent stake in Twitter. Instead, the market first heard the news weeks later, by which time Mr Musk owned 9.1 per cent of the company. In response to this news, the share price rose 27 per cent. By not informing the market, Mr Musk was able to buy 4.1 per cent more of the company at a price much lower than he would have, reportedly saving him $US156 million ($209 million). Since then, former Twitter shareholders have sued Mr Musk, claiming they missed out on recent rises in the company's stock price because he waited too long to disclose his stake in the company. A lawyer for Mr Musk had no immediate comment. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. If the SEC finds Mr Musk breached the rules, he'll be fined. But if he'd joined the board, the consequences could have been more severe. At the very least, he'd have been more entangled in legal obligations. Given all this was foreseeable, it's possible Mr Musk never intended to join the board, even a month ago, when he bought the shares. The whole point of this circus act may have been to get people speculating about Mr Musk's motives — to make headlines, like with this article. ""I don't know what goes on in the mind of Elon Musk,"" Professor Burgess said. ""There's a certain element to this that's just about trolling on a planetary scale — that goes with his persona."" ""Twitter substantially controlled by Musk would be a Twitter in chaos mode."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

168,How Putin's propaganda is sowing seeds of doubt to deny sympathy for Ukraine,science,"  Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A week before the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv came under intense shelling for the first time since World War II, an alarming video announcement was circulating on encrypted messaging app, Telegram. Warning: This article contains images and details readers might find distressing. The pro-Russian separatist leaders of the self-declared Donetsk (DPR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) warned the Ukrainian military would invade the regions on the order of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ""Today, their guns are aimed at civilians, at us and our children,"" said DPR head Denis Pushilin, donned in military greens, in a video posted to his official Telegram channel. ""From today, on February 18 … women, children and elderly people are subject to evacuation. ""We kindly ask you to listen and make the right decision. Temporary departure will save the life and health of you and your loved ones."" Catch up on all the news about the Russian invasion of Ukraine It was civilian investigators from Bellingcat — who played a significant role in linking Russia to the downing of MH17 — who first noticed something awry about the post. ""When you check the metadata associated with that video, it had been filmed a couple of days before,"" said Bellingcat researcher Nick Waters. The metadata in the video, which has been independently verified by the ABC, showed the export timestamp of the announcement was created two days earlier, on February 16. Telegram is one of the few social messaging services which preserves such information. ""What we saw in the run-up to the actual invasion was a pretty concerted attempt to show Ukraine as the aggressors,"" Mr Waters said. ""In multiple examples, these stories were completely unfounded and were debunked very, very quickly. ""Of course, despite this, Russia then invaded."" Russia tried to build the foundation of its invasion of Ukraine on a lie — such as declaring the country, run by a Jewish president, had a Nazi problem — and it has shown no sign of changing course. Since the invasion began, journalists — such as those at the ABC, the BBC and Agence France Presse — have published articles and videos dissecting false claims pushed by both sides of the conflict. One significant round of debunks in March pulled apart claims posted by Russian officials who falsely claimed that pregnant women being pulled from the rubble of a maternity hospital in Mariupol on March 16 were actors. But the appearance of such rigorous verification techniques employed by Western media outlets during the conflict has been weaponised by pro-Russian actors as part of an orchestrated disinformation campaign established weeks into the invasion. The new tactic involves half a dozen pro-Kremlin Telegram channels which appear to operate as forensically minded and independent fact-checkers. Their content looks and sounds like debunks, but are fake. Some of their ""debunks"" are simple, such as a post on March 1 in a channel with 720,000 subscribers — which the ABC has chosen not to name — that purportedly denies that fighting had occurred in the city of Kharkiv. This counterclaim was false and easily refuted, even at the time — there was overwhelming evidence of the city being shelled. Another post the next day showed pictures of the aftermath of a TV tower being destroyed in Kyiv. The account highlighted the ""strange position"" of burnt bodies caught in a twisted fence line and suggested Ukrainian forces had delivered bodies from a nearby morgue for the photo — it then posted a screenshot of Google Maps showing the distance between the two. There was no evidence to support these claims. Hundreds of these posts — ""imposter news"" or ""fake bunks"" have emerged in the past month. Public interest investigative journalism outfit ProPublica reported some of these supposed fact-checks were also correcting content which had never actually circulated in Ukrainian channels. Despite the dubious analysis, the channel has appeared on Russian state media and has been pushed by the Russian Ministry of Defence. Joan Donovan — the research director at Harvard University's Shorenstein Centre on media, politics and public policy — said these channels gave the impression that Ukraine was running its own disinformation campaign and, therefore, it could not be trusted. ""There's an evolution in media manipulation tactics we haven't seen at this scale before,"" Dr Donovan said. ""The enemies of truth on the internet are going to use every tool at their disposal."" Many accusations directed against Russia, both from Ukrainian officials and independent media, involve serious allegations of war crimes. On April 1, when Ukrainian troops reclaimed Bucha, north-east of Kyiv, they discovered a landscape of horrors. Footage emerged of mass graves and corpses strewn in the streets. Survivors told reporters about rape, torture and executions of civilians. When confronted with evidence and testimonies, the Russian Ministry of Defence in a statement called the visual evidence ""another hoax"". Its embassy in Canada claimed one of the corpses in verified footage moved its arm (it didn't). The Russian Security Council's deputy chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, said ""enraged beasts from [Ukrainian] nationalist battalions … are ready to casually kill their own civilians in a bid to dehumanise Russia"". These deflections from the Kremlin are just another chapter in its propaganda playbook, one it has been using for over a decade. French philosopher Jacques Ellul said that, during the Cold War, propaganda wasn't about persuasion but about compelling action. ""I think that there's a second side to propaganda that is equally important, which is obfuscation … which is to get you to not do something,"" said author and University of Stirling's Idrees Ahmad. Dr Ahmad, who lectures on international conflicts and disinformation, has been closely watching the invasion of Ukraine. The sequence of events felt familiar to the professor and other researchers who had been following the conflict in Syria, which quietly ticked over into its 11th year last month. ""Many people's attitude towards the Syrian conflict was that it was very complex, and things were not straightforward,"" Dr Ahmad said. ""If you create enough doubt, then people are reluctant even to sympathise."" After a chemical attack killed at least 281 people in the south-western city of Ghouta in August 2013, President Putin penned an op-ed in the New York Times accusing opposition forces of gassing its own people to ""provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons"". A report from the Human Rights Watch had concluded evidence ""all points to the Syrian government responsibility for the attacks"" and found alternative claims that opposition forces were responsible were ""lacking in credibility"". The HRW's findings were echoed by other independent investigators within the media. After another deadly chemical attack in Douma in 2018, the Russian Ministry of Defence tried to blame rebels again for gassing civilians before denying chemical weapons were even used. The Kremlin's claims to a ""false flag"" operation orchestrated by rebels were never independently substantiated but convincing the world to adopt an alternative reality was not its objective. ""Counter-narratives were myriad,"" Dr Ahmad said, ""they didn't accord with each other, they didn't even kind of agree with each other. ""But the point was not to create a persuasive counter-story. The aim was just to create so many different stories that the truth gets lost among all of them."" The deliberate deflection and firehose of falsehoods may have had a wider impact 10, or even four, years ago. But we're operating now in a ""very mature social media ecosystem"", according to Dr Donovan. Dr Donovan said both reporters and social media users have become cognisant of disinformation and digital propaganda efforts over recent years. However, the Ukrainian-Russian conflict had escalated the information arms race faster than she anticipated. One common technique seen during the invasion — which hasn't been definitively linked to Russian-aligned forces — was the use of an apparent bot network. An analysis of 250,000 tweets conducted by Timothy Graham at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) found evidence of co-ordinated bot-like behaviour on Twitter, pushing the #IStandWithPutin hashtag in the days after the first bombing of Kyiv, to create an impression of widespread support for the invasion. Many of the accounts amplifying the hashtag have been banned since the analysis but, in Dr Graham's sample, checked by the ABC, it is worth noting that many using the phrase were genuine accounts who hijacked it to post anti-Kremlin content. The response to this apparent bot-network supported Dr Donovan's argument that social media had matured, but she and other experts say it is too early to declare Russia was losing the information war. ""Ukraine has won the hearts and minds, in the morality of the moment,"" Dr Donovan said. ""But, for every Ukrainian that doesn't have access to cell phone coverage or electricity … I wonder if we're inflating what it means to win here when people are struggling so much to be heard on the ground. ""I question whether winning the information war is something … to make us [in the West] feel better about not being able to do the kind of humanitarian mission we would hope for."" The tale of the underdog Ukraine fighting valiantly against its invader has generated goodwill and support for Ukraine, but Dr Ahmad warns history could be repeating itself. ""If this conflict drags on longer, you will see what people said during Syria,"" Dr Ahmad said. ""In the beginning it looks clear-cut to anybody who was paying attention but, as time goes on, it's very easy to obfuscate and once the headlines move on … people start looking for reasons not to pay attention. ""People will start saying, 'This is complex, it's not as straightforward as it looks'."" New York Times photographer Lynsey Addario's image of a family killed by shelling while trying to evacuate from Irpin could become crucial evidence in the prosecution of war crimes. Both Dr Donovan and Dr Ahmad say a key battlefield in the information war will be inside Russia, where access to news from outside its borders has been dramatically limited. While both expressed concern about how much reliable information Russian citizens were receiving, Mr Waters said the Bellingcat article about the invasion was attracting more and more readers from Russia. They were among its top 10 sources of readers by country. There was also other evidence, he said, of domestic agitation. ""The number of protesters who are coming out to protest against the war … it's not huge, in comparison to Western standards, but it's still thousands of people who are facing some pretty significant sanctions,"" Mr Waters said. ""You know, thousands of people turning up to anti-war protests … that's pretty good evidence in my view.""

169,"A shift in climate may have prompted the evolution of our species 300,000 years ago in southern Africa",science," Science Human evolution and climate study suggests Homo sapiens evolved in southern Africa Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Where exactly in Africa our species evolved is one of the hottest points of contention in human evolution. Now a new study suggests Homo sapiens emerged in a single region in the south of the continent around 300,000 years ago. To reach their verdict, a team of researchers from South Korea and Europe simulated the Earth's climate history back 2 million years, and paired it with ancient human bone and tool discoveries. The study was published in Nature today — but not everyone agrees with its conclusions. Study lead author Axel Timmermann, from the Institute for Basic Science Center for Climate Physics at Pusan University, said it's the first study to link archaeological evidence with long-range climate modelling to piece together a story of early human movement and evolution. ""And it turns out it's the longest climate simulation ever conducted with a model of this complexity."" Ian Moffat, a geoarchaeologist from Flinders University who was not involved in the work, said the study took a broad look at the ""engine room"" of early human evolution: Africa, Europe and parts of Asia. ""These are the places that have historically defined the narrative of early human evolution. ""It's good that questions [about human evolution] are being asked using these rigorous approaches to the climate record."" The human family tree isn't a neat and tidy series of branches. It's a tangle of forks, offshoots and dead ends, with some limbs rejoining and intermingling multiple times over the millennia as different species interbred and migrated. What compelled our human ancestors to wander into new territory was probably climate change, which could have made a home region less hospitable, or neighbouring areas easier to explore. The discovery of ancient remains of Stone Age humans in Morocco pushes back the date of the origin of our species by 100,000 years. That said, nailing down what the climate was like at a site that was occupied by early humans is a tricky task. Researchers can, for instance, date sediments and analyse bits and bobs like pollen lodged in the soil. Knowing what plants grew gives researchers an idea of the climate of the time. But the qualities that make archaeological sites like caves so good at accumulating fossilised bones and tools — they're sheltered, dry, and can remain relatively undisturbed by the outside environment — means they don't accumulate much in the way of climate evidence, Dr Moffat said. ""It would be wonderful to find archaeological materials in a site that had a really good climate record. But it's so unusual."" So instead of relying on sediments from archaeological digs to provide climate information, the new study used a computer model — the same type of model used in Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change reports, Professor Timmermann said. ""It's been used for future climate change projections as well as, now, in our case, 2 million years into the past."" The climate cycles modelled by Professor Timmermann and his team were different to climate change as we know it today, which is driven by an influx of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Changes in climate that encouraged our ancient ancestors to move were driven by celestial objects. Such astronomical climate cycles are called Milankovitch cycles, named for the Serbian polymath credited with first pondering their existence in the 1920s. There are a few types of Milankovitch cycles, including one that's dictated by Earth's distance from the Sun. As our planet orbits the Sun, it doesn't travel in a perfect circle. The gravitational heft of Jupiter and Saturn periodically stretches our trajectory into a vague oval shape. This means Earth is further from the Sun some of the time, and receives less warmth. Another Milankovitch cycle arises because the Moon and Sun's gravitational tug makes the planet bulge slightly around the equator. Then as Earth spins on its tilted axis, its equatorial bloat induces a ""wobble"" that affects which hemisphere cops more radiation from the Sun. Changes in the Earth's tilt, too, affect the climate, but to a lesser extent, Professor Timmermann said. Milankovitch cycles warm and cool the planet on timescales from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years (but cannot explain Earth's current warming). And when the cycles align so the Northern Hemisphere gets less solar radiation in summer, it can kick off an ice age. Professor Timmermann and his team simulated Earth's climate as it wobbled its way around the Sun covering most of a geological epoch called the Pleistocene. At the beginning of the Pleistocene around 2 million years ago, the climate entered a cool cycle. It's around this time the first waves of early human migration out of Africa began. One of the first species to likely make those initial forays was an archaic relative of modern humans known as Homo erectus. The researchers found their climate predictions matched pretty well with physical evidence, such as ice drilled from deep in polar ice sheets, which act as proxies for past climate. From their modelling, the team produced maps showing parts of the world that were suitable for early human habitation based on factors like rainfall and food availability. Where ancient humans lived — and when — can be unveiled using DNA extracted from sediment layers dug from cave floors. Then, on these maps, the researchers overlaid more than 3,200 archaeological discoveries from six species of human, including our species, Neanderthals, and H. heidelbergensis, which is thought to have appeared in Africa around 800,000 years ago. The maps allowed the researchers to see the different kinds of environments each human species preferred to dwell in. They found, for instance, that archaic humans preferred to hang out in regions with a pretty stable climate, while humans that emerged later, such as H. heidelbergensis, were wanderers who could settle in harsher, drier conditions. The maps also showed where where one form of early human disappeared while a second appeared, pointing to one species evolving into another. They saw this happen to H. heidelbergensis in two places at two times. By around half a million years ago, H. heidelbergensis had spread from southern Africa throughout Europe, and maybe into Asia too. Around 400,000 years ago, European H. heidelbergensis dwindled and Neanderthals emerged. Then 300,000 years ago, southern African H. heidelbergensis started to be replaced by H. sapiens. So what caused this speciation that gave rise to us? Around the time H. sapiens appeared, Professor Timmermann said Africa was getting very dry. ""There was a major drop in habitat suitability ... and it was actually quite dramatic to the habitats in southern Africa."" It may have been that as local H. heidelbergensis populations shrank, so too did their gene pool. Such ""genetic bottlenecks"" could have then led to the evolution of our species in southern Africa, Professor Timmermann said. This single southern African origin for H. sapiens evolution is a claim that probably won't sit well with everyone in the human evolution domain. A competing hypothesis suggests our species didn't evolve from one area, but instead arose from multiple ""subdivided"" populations across the African continent that sporadically bred with each other. Michael Petraglia, head of Griffith University's Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, is a proponent of a more ""multi-regional"" model. Archaeologists have discovered stone tools and fragments of animal fossils in Arabia that indicate humans passed through the peninsula several times when the climate was wet. The new study's climate models showed suitable human habitats in eastern as well as southern Africa, but there was only enough archaeological and fossil evidence to support the origin of our species in the southern region. ""And here's the fundamental problem,"" Professor Petraglia said. ""They're doing this based on current fossils and archaeological data. But places like Africa are hugely understudied."" In other words, evidence for our species evolving in other parts of Africa could be there. It's just not yet been dug up. Such ancient fossil and tool scarcity is a ""perpetual problem"" in archaeology, Dr Moffat said. ""Is it evidence of absence or absence of evidence? ""There's always the question of how much of what we found reflects the original distribution of the species, and how much of it is an accident of geography and geology."" Another potential spanner in the study's works, Professor Petraglia wrote in an accompanying News and Views article in the journal Nature, is inferring the presence of particular human species at different sites based on tools alone. Fossilised bones are incredibly rare, so most physical evidence of ancient humans comes from artefacts like tools they left behind. But it can be incredibly hard, sometimes impossible, to designate a species to a tool in the absence of fossils, Professor Petraglia said. ""Neanderthals and Homo sapiens were using very similar toolkits. We know that. ""And in most of these 3,200 sites [in the new study], they're ... mostly archaeological sites with only stone tools, but [the researchers] are willing to categorise them as belonging to a species. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. ""As an example, even species that are absent in their model like Denisovans could have been using some of the toolkits that they say were being used by Homo heidelbergensis."" Finding more fossils and better categorisation of tools will bring the intricate story of human evolution into crisper focus. New techniques that let researchers piece together genetic material extracted from fossils or even sediments will likely shake up archaeology too, Dr Moffat said. ""As ancient DNA techniques come online more, and hopefully we can push back to this era, then I think we'll see a whole other understanding of human evolution and the family tree emerge.""

170,'We were just swimming in little geckos': Heavy rain leads to record wildlife count for desert reserve,science,"  Recent heavy rain leads to record number of native animal captures in desert park Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A South Australian wildlife reserve in the state's arid north has counted its second highest number of native animals in 25 years. Each year, the team at Arid Recovery near Roxby Downs conduct a week-long pitfall trapping survey to collect data about how different mammals and reptiles are faring before returning them to the wild. General manager Katherine Tuft said heavy rain across the state's outback in January contributed to this year's success, and set a new record for the highest number of reptiles caught in one year. Dr Tuft said 1,045 animals were caught during the survey, 800 of which were different species of reptiles. ""We were just swimming in little geckos and skinks and other creatures and quite a good number of mammals and a few frogs and even a couple of birds in our little bucket traps in the ground, so it was a very productive year,"" she said. ""It seems that the rainfall when it's like that is just so pervasive in increasing the productivity of the desert ecosystems out here. ""They’re just really good at taking advantage of good conditions so they can breed up very quickly, and in fact a lot of the animals we were catching were young ones that had recently hatched or recently born."" Pitfall trapping is the method used to capture the animals. ""Essentially, you dig buckets into the ground so that the top is flush with the ground surface and then you run a little fence using fly mesh between the rows of buckets,"" Dr Tuft said. ""As animals are moving around doing their business they bump into the fence and wander along and then fall into the bucket. ""Then we come along at dawn and at dusk to check the pits and look for what we’ve caught and work out what species they are and take some measurements and let them go again."" The method has given researches an insight into the abundance and diversity of small mammals and reptiles living within the reserve. Dr Tuft said the process also provided information about about how major weather events effect the ecosystem. ""This year was the 25th year of running the survey, so it’s a really long-term data set now and we’ve been able to see how things change over the cycles of drought and wetter years out here and that can be really dramatic in the desert,"" she said. She said one of the most important aspects of the survey was the understanding it provided researchers on the effect of the predator-proof fence and the reintroduction of animals that were locally extinct. ""We can see how that changes the game for some of these smaller creatures that were in the landscape. So, there’s some winners and losers.""

171,Cryptocurrency expert jailed for advising North Korea how to evade sanctions,science,"  US man jailed for breaching sanctions by advising North Korea on cryptocurrency Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A United States man has been sentenced to more than five years in federal prison for advising North Korea on cryptocurrency trading, in contravention of US sanctions. Virgil Griffith advised North Korea on how to use cryptocurrency to evade sanctions Increasingly tight sanctions have been imposed on North Korea in recent years to try to rein in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs Griffith is the creator of WikiScanner, a tool which unmasks people who anonymously edit entries in Wikipedia Virgil Griffith, 39, was sentenced on Tuesday, local time, after pleading guilty last year to conspiracy. He admitted to presenting at a cryptocurrency conference in Pyongyang in 2019, even after the US government denied his request to travel there. A well-known hacker, Griffith also developed ""cryptocurrency infrastructure and equipment inside North Korea"", prosecutors wrote in court papers. At the 2019 conference, he advised more than 100 people — including several who appeared to work for the North Korean government — on how to use cryptocurrency to evade sanctions and achieve independence from the global banking system. Both the US and the UN Security Council have imposed increasingly tight sanctions on North Korea in recent years to try to rein in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The US government amended sanctions against North Korea in 2018 to prohibit ""a US person, wherever located"" from exporting technology to North Korea. Prosecutors said Griffith acknowledged his presentation amounted to a transfer of technical knowledge to conference attendees. ""Griffith is an American citizen who chose to evade the sanctions of his own country to provide services to a hostile foreign power,"" prosecutors wrote. ""He did so, knowing that power — North Korea — was guilty of atrocities against its own people and has made threats against the United States citing its nuclear capabilities."" Defence attorney Brian Klein described Griffith as a ""brilliant, Caltech-trained scientist who developed a curiosity bordering on obsession"" with North Korea. ""He viewed himself — albeit arrogantly and naively — as acting in the interest of peace,"" Mr Klein said. ""He loves his country and never set out to do any harm."" Mr Klein added that he was disappointed with the 63-month prison sentence but ""pleased the judge acknowledged Virgil's commitment to moving forward with his life productively, and that he is a talented person who has a lot to contribute."" Hundreds of millions of dollars is being stolen from financial institutions and cryptocurrency firms and exchanges and used to fund North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, according to a United Nations report. A self-described ""disruptive technologist"", Griffith became something of a tech-world ""enfant terrible"" in the early 2000s. In 2007, he created WikiScanner, a tool that aimed to unmask people who anonymously edited entries in Wikipedia, the crowdsourced online encyclopedia. WikiScanner essentially could determine the business, institutions or government agencies that owned the computers from which some edits were made. It quickly identified businesses that had sabotaged competitors' entries and government agencies that had rewritten history, among other findings. ""I am quite pleased to see the mainstream media enjoying the public-relations disaster fireworks as I am,"" Griffith said in 2007. Mr Klein previously said Griffith cooperated with the FBI and ""helped educate law enforcement"" about the so-called dark web, a network of encrypted internet sites that allows users to remain anonymous.

172,Elon Musk sued by former Twitter shareholders for not disclosing his stake on time,science,"  Elon Musk sued by former Twitter shareholders for delay in disclosing his stake in company Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Elon Musk has been sued by former Twitter shareholders who claim they missed out on recent rises in its stock price because he waited too long to disclose his stake in the company. In a proposed class action filed in Manhattan federal court, the shareholders said Mr Musk made ""materially false and misleading statements and omissions"" by failing to reveal he had invested in Twitter by March 24, as required under federal law. Mr Musk, who is also the chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, purchased a 9.2 per cent stake in Twitter on March 14. The purchase made him the largest shareholder in the company. After Mr Musk disclosed his stake on April 4, Twitter shares rose by 27 per cent to $US49.97 ($67.13), which investors viewed as a vote of confidence from the world's richest person. US securities law requires investors to disclose within 10 days when they have acquired 5 per cent of a company, which in Mr Musk's case would have been March 24. The former shareholders, led by Marc Rasella, said the delayed disclosure let Mr Musk buy more Twitter shares at lower prices, while defrauding them into selling at ""artificially deflated"" prices. Mr Rasella said he sold 35 Twitter shares for $US1,373 ($1,844) or an average price of $US39.23 ($52.69) between March 25 and 29. The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. A lawyer for Mr Musk had no immediate comment. Tesla is not a defendant. Twitter announced on April 5 that Mr Musk would join its board of directors, but this week the company's chief executive said he had decided not to. Twitter's largest shareholder, billionaire Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, has decided not to join the company's board. In a note to staff, Twitter's chief executive Parag Agrawal said the social media giant would still be ""open to"" Mr Musk's input. By not joining the board, Mr Musk can keep buying shares without being bound by his agreement with the company to limit his stake to 14.9 per cent. Mr Musk is a prolific Twitter user and has previously said he planned to bring about significant improvements at the company. Before taking a stake in the company, Mr Musk ran a Twitter poll asking users if they believed Twitter adhered to the principles of free speech. A day after becoming the largest shareholder, he launched another poll asking users if they wanted an edit button — a feature Twitter engineers have been working on. Some analysts have also suggested Mr Musk could use his stake to push Twitter to make changes, or even pursue an unsolicited bid for the company. Mr Musk is worth $US265.1 billion ($355.8 billion), according to Forbes magazine.

173,Why collecting koala sperm could be the answer to saving the species,science,"  Koala sperm could be the insurance policy that saves the species from extinction Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A biobank of koala sperm could future-proof the species against extinction and make breeding programs cheaper and more successful, according to new research from the University of Newcastle. Koalas were this year listed as endangered across most of Australia's east coast and are predicted to face extinction by 2050. While there has been some research conducted on assisted koala breeding, to date there has been no dedicated investment towards developing the large-scale collection and storage of koala reproductive material. ""We have no insurance policy against natural disasters like the 2019–20 bushfires that threaten to wipe out large numbers of animals at the one time,"" conservation scientist Ryan Witt said. ""If the koala population dies in these kind of fire events, there is no way to bring them back or preserve their genetics."" Dr Witt co-authored the research, which was published today in the international journal Animals. Assisted reproductive techniques have been used for decades to treat human fertility and breed animals for agriculture, but its use for wildlife conservation has lagged behind. Dr Witt said their modelling demonstrated that techniques such as artificial insemination in koala breeding programs could deliver a 5 to 12-fold reduction in costs. ""Captive breeding programs require larger koala colony sizes to prevent inbreeding, but by integrating assisted reproduction we can reduce the number of koalas needing to be in captivity, lower costs, and improve genetic diversity,"" Dr Witt said. ""This would free up valuable conservation funding to support a greater number of species, or to support other koala conservation efforts such as habitat restoration."" Scientists have successfully used fresh and chilled sperm to breed koalas, but there remains a knowledge-gap in developing the technique and technology for using frozen sperm. Lead author Lachlan Howell said it should not stop the collection of koala sperm now. ""We would get started as soon as we could with the banking down of reproductive material and that buys you time to invest in the research and develop the tools,"" Dr Howell said. ""Time is of the essence."" Port Stephens Koala Hospital president Ron Land said the hospital, in collaboration with the University of Newcastle and Taronga Conservation Society, put forward a detailed biobanking proposal to the state government two months ago but had had no response. ""We're able to start the project immediately, if we got the funding to do so,"" he said. ""We're bemused that the government is making these statements about how it wants to double the number of koalas in NSW by 2050, yet the silence is deafening in regards to the funding. ""Unless this type of technology is proven and deployed, they haven't got a chance in hell of doubling the amount of koalas in 30 years.""

174,"Self-driving car pulled over by San Francisco police, but no one was inside",science,"  Self-driving car pulled over by San Francisco police, but there was nobody inside Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog A video posted on social media reveals San Francisco police pulling over a self-driving vehicle, only to find nobody inside. In the video, the hatchback is stopped by police in the city's Richmond District, and the vehicle belongs to an autonomous car company, Cruise, which is based in the Bay Area. The video starts off with what appears to be a typical police pull-over, as the vehicle had been seen driving without its headlights on. An officer gets out of a police car that is parked close behind and approaches the Cruise car, finding it empty. A bystander can be heard saying, ""Ain't nobody in it — this is crazy."" The car then proceeds to drive to the other side of the intersection, only to stop again and activate its hazard lights. Police then approach the car a second time. The video, which was originally posted on Instagram, has since circulated widely on social media. A Twitter user, Seth Weintraub, posted the video with a ""Welcome to the future"" comment. In a direct response to Weintraub's tweet, Cruise's corporate Twitter account said the vehicle had operated as expected, by driving to a safer location on the other side of the intersection. Cruise also said they ""work closely with the San Francisco Police Department on how to interact with our vehicles, including a dedicated phone number for them to call in situations like this"". As Australia inches closer to endorsing driverless vehicles with on-road trials, the Cruise video has resurfaced questions of vehicle safety and testing.

175,"Hidden cameras, spyware, GPS tracking: Lawyers report 'explosion' in tech-based abuse of women",science,"  More women are being harassed, tracked through an 'explosion' in tech-based abuse, lawyers say Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Spyware on mobile phones. GPS trackers attached to vehicles. Cameras in children's toys. These are some of the ways women are being stalked and harassed, according to the lawyers who represent them, and the academics who study technology-based abuse. Family lawyer Catherine Leach, of Leach Legal in Perth, said she had seen a ""big explosion"" in technology such as apps, GPS trackers and cameras being weaponised against her clients by domestic abusers and stalkers. ""One client in particular, her husband sent her a photo of the children, which she opened, and that activated some sort of spyware that then got uploaded onto her phone,"" Ms Leach said. ""And he was then able to access her phone without her knowledge."" The federal government recently announced a $104 million budget allocation for a ""technology-focused"" package to keep women and children safe from domestic and sexual violence. This included $54.6 million for security assessments to sweep women's homes for cameras and bugs and ensure their phones were safe from spyware and tracking. A national survey of domestic and family violence agencies last year found more than two-thirds of service providers had reported an increase in clients during the pandemic. When Lisa* left her abusive partner, he put a tracking device on her car. He'd also installed spyware on her phone. But the worst thing he used technology for still haunts her today. Chief executive of Women's Legal Service WA Jennie Gray said for many victim-survivors, this level of surveillance actually instilled more fear in them than physical violence. ""This is all part of a coercive control dynamic,"" she said. The funding package would also endeavour to raise community awareness of tech-facilitated abuse. Ms Leach said one of the biggest challenges for victim-survivors of tech-based abuse was not being believed. Husbands ""very frequently"" built a picture of the wife as having a mental illness, she said. ""So, you get people who don't believe these women and they start saying, 'You're just being paranoid, it's not a conspiracy theory, he's not tracking you',"" Ms Leach said. ""And people just don't take it seriously."" Dr Gray said there was ""an uneven response"" when women took these kinds of cases to the police. Ms Leach recommended clients who suspected they were being tracked to take their phone to a mobile phone store to check for spyware. She said one client who suspected there was spyware on her phone made mention of something in a text specifically to test if her stalker knew about it. ""And then it came up in his conversation and so she knew then that he was spying on her,"" she said. Colleen Fisher, head of the School of Population and Global Health at the University of Western Australia, started researching violence against women in the 1990s. She said any government spending on tech-based abuse should focus on connecting domestic violence support services with the IT sector. ""People who work in this area traditionally — domestic violence professionals, legal people, what have you — we don't have that technological expertise,"" Professor Fisher said. She has been studying tech-based abuse with colleagues from the University of Sheffield in the UK and said the types of abuse ranged from using geolocation through Facebook photos to cameras being hidden behind photos. ""It's quite often reported that children, for example, go on an access visit and they'll come back and then all of a sudden the perpetrator keeps turning up at places that the woman's at,"" Professor Fisher said. ""What happened is, during that access visit, there might have been a tracking device put into the toys or something like that."" Dr Gray said the new measures to be funded by the federal government's budget allocation would need to be accessible in ways that did not put the victim survivor in additional danger. ""We need to make sure that this kind of support is accessible in multiple ways, and through multiple agencies, and through multiple mechanisms,"" she said. She said support systems, such as services that looked for spyware on women's phones or swept their homes for cameras, should be developed in consultation with victim survivors. The federal Minister for Women's Safety, Anne Ruston, said the funding would provide victim-survivors with access to technology safety specialists. ""We want to support women and children to remain in their home — or a home of their choice — where it is safe and appropriate to do so, through safety planning and the provision of personal safety alarms, security cameras, dash cameras and other technology solutions,"" she said.

176,Mass fish-kill event strikes popular tourist beaches on Ningaloo Coast ,science,"  Mass fish kill hits popular Coral Bay beaches on WA's Ningaloo Coast Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog As holiday makers enjoy the crystal blue water at Bill's Bay, in the WA tourist town of Coral Bay, fish skeletons lie scattered among the seaweed. It's a stark reminder of Western Australia's largest fish-kill event in more than a decade and the epic effort locals made to save the beach before the peak tourist season began. On March 27, the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD), launched an investigation into the fish kill after an estimated 16,000 dead fish were counted along affected beaches on the Ningaloo Coast, including Turquoise Bay, Bill's Bay and Yardie Creek. Bill's Bay, Coral Bay's most popular swimming beach, was the most severely impacted. During this time, DPIRD warned people not the enter into or fish from the putrid water, which contained high levels of bacteria. The analysis of water samples from Bill's Bay indicated no harmful algae were present, DPIRD said, but ammonia, nitrates and phosphates were detected, likely the result of decaying coral spawn and fish. Marion Massam, from DPIRD, said the department believed the mass fish-kill event was caused by coral spawning. ""Coral spawn itself can use up oxygen in the water and when it breaks down, more oxygen is used up as part of the breakdown process,"" Ms Massam said. ""That reduces oxygen in the water for the fish. They can end up dying as a result."" Coral spawning is an annual event, which typically occurs following the March full moon, after corals are stimulated by the seasonal rise in water temperatures. DPIRD said another factor which could have contributed was local marine heatwave conditions that occurred along the Ningaloo coastline in late March. The department said the coral-spawn slicks could drift towards the shore and when trapped close to the coast, could create low oxygen conditions made worse by a low tide and swell. The Ningaloo Coast is no stranger to fish-kill events. Authorities said the last fish kill of this magnitude was 12 years ago. If you're travelling to Coral Bay these Easter school holidays, you can thank John Farne for the improved state of the beaches. With a couple of trucks, a bobcat and a loader, John, his mates and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) took to the beach to clean up the dead fish, which were taken to the local tip. ""It was as bad as it gets and every year the coral spawns and you walk out and you go — sniff — 'Oh the coral is spawning' and that's the end of it. There's very little. But this year was the exception,"" he said. ""But as locals, we want to have it clean. We can't do much about the water but that's now freshened up. It's lovely out there so Easter school holidays, we're good to go."" On April 8, DPIRD removed the fish-kill alert for Turquoise Bay, Yardie Creek, Point Billie and Jane's Bay. Sallyann Gudge, from the DBCA, said a survey of dead fish showed they were all reef-associated species and the ecosystem should recover soon. ""Fingers crossed that all those things fall into place and those fish numbers can come back. A lot of those fish species do recruit pretty quickly,"" Ms Gudge said. Authorities say they will continue to keep a close eye on the Ningaloo Coast and the fish population. DPIRD has reminded visitors to exercise caution in the area and not to enter or fish from any water that appears smelly and putrid, as it could contain high levels of bacteria. They urge people to report any further fish kills to Fishwatch at fish.wa.gov.au or on 1800 815 507.

177,Is it fair to turn regional areas into a 'dumping ground' for Sydney's rubbish?,science,"  Is it fair to turn regional areas into a 'dumping ground' for Sydney's rubbish? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Is it fair that regional areas should have to have to deal with Sydney's growing waste problem? Residents two hours west of Sydney are asking themselves that question with plans to build a waste to energy incinerator on one of the region's former coal-fired power stations. And Lithgow isn't the only regional area in NSW that could face the prospect of hosting a waste to energy development. Last year, after multiple controversial proposals in Sydney, the NSW government released a draft policy for the controversial industry which would restrict its development to just four areas near Lithgow, Goulburn, Parkes and the Richmond Valley near Casino. And now those regions are calling for compensation if they have to deal with the waste. The prospect of becoming a 'dumping ground' for Sydney rubbish doesn't sit well with Wallerawang resident Karen Brown who said the region had hosted coal mines and power stations to keep the lights on in Sydney for more than a century. ""Wallerawang and Lithgow have done their bit with dirty industries over the years."" ""Which I'm very proud of, all my family has worked in those industries, but they used to say close your eyes and hold your nose when you drive through Lithgow and this is just going to add to that,"" she said. 'If it's not good enough for Sydney, why is it good enough for us?' she said. Lifelong Lithgow resident Len Ashworth says he's most concerned about reputational damage to the region from becoming a ""receptacle for Sydney's garbage"". ""This was something forced on us by the state government,"" he said. ""They chose four locations in New South Wales to suffer the indignity of having Sydney's garbage dumped on them."" Mr Ashworth said the fact the industry had been ruled-out of Sydney and relegated to the regions was more evidence of a 'city-centric' state government. ""It's a Sydney problem and Sydney should be taking care of it themselves,"" he said. Greenspot Australia, the company behind the Wallerawang proposal, have been trying to get the community behind the industry as an environmentally conscious economic boost to the region. ""These sorts of facilities have been controversial no matter where they're proposed,"" Brett Hawkins, chief executive of Greenspot, said. The company has partnered with the ASX-listed waste giant Cleanaway, which was developing a facility in western Sydney before the new policy forced them to look further west. Cleanaway said modern waste-to-energy incinerators produced fewer greenhouse emissions than landfill and far less pollutants than nearby coal-fired power stations. ""They [Cleanaway] were very excited about that opportunity [in Sydney] and equally I'd like to think they're very excited about the opportunity as it might exist at [Wallerawang,"" he said. Local councils now facing the prospect of hosting waste to energy generators have called for compensation for dealing with Sydney's rubbish. The Goulburn-Mulwaree Council, which remains strongly opposed to the industry, has called for a levy of $20 for every tonne of rubbish burnt to go to the local community. This would amount to about 20 cents for every red-lidded bin picked up in Sydney. Mr said compensation to the local community was justified. ""Those sorts of royalty discussions are certainly on the table and I think they're fair,"" he said. Deputy Premier Paul Toole, who is also the local representative for Lithgow, has been contacted for comment.

178,"After treating many 'wobbly possums', this wildlife clinic found a 'prevalent' disease",science,"  Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary helping to detect emerging diseases in wildlife across the country Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog You could describe them as ""wildlife agents"". Not only are they tasked with saving the lives of native animals, but the team at Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary in Tasmania's south also collects valuable intelligence on a range of species, some of which are unique to the state. ""We see 100 animals a month at the wildlife veterinary hospital and about 20-30 animals every week,"" senior veterinarian Alex Kreiss said. ""About 90 per cent of the cases we see are trauma-related and 10 per cent would be a result of infectious diseases or diseases that are not related to humans"". It is the 10 per cent of cases that are critical in providing wildlife experts with information to help them better understand and treat emerging diseases in native wildlife in Tasmania and across the country. An example of this is when several brushtail possums started coming into the veterinary hospital with neurological signs including incoordination, loss of balance, circling and difficulty climbing. ""We had never seen those signs before and then suddenly we had two or three possums that presented with it,"" Mr Kreiss said. The disease is called ""wobbly possum"" and was previously thought to be unique to possums in New Zealand. ""This was a disease we didn't know we had in Tasmania and certainly we didn't think it was prevalent,"" Mr Kreiss said. Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary sent away blood and tissue samples to try to learn more about how the disease was transmitted and how it affected the animal. ""Bonorong first detected the disease in Australia several years ago and worked with Biosecurity Tasmania to identify and look into those cases, so their information was critical,"" Wildlife Health Australia National Coordinator Tiggy Grillo said. Now the sanctuary is expanding its network and sharing capabilities after it joined a national wildlife surveillance program coordinated by Wildlife Health Australia. ""We [at Bonorong] are part of a network of similarly orientated veterinary hospitals and clinics, where we can share data and information,"" Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary veterinary nurse Matthew Clements said. There are 10 participating facilities, known as ""sentinel clinics"", that monitor and track diseases that have the potential to affect animals, humans and livestock. Significant findings are handed over to the federal government to investigate further. ""Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary is one of three clinics that has recently joined the program, so that will broaden the geographical area,"" Ms Grillo said. ""[Wildlife Health Australia] are looking to find data across as many species as possible and are keen to find information and discoveries that supports the health of native species. ""It gives veterinary hospitals and clinics the ability to connect with others, compare notes and have the conversation nationally,"" Ms Grillo said. Mr Clements said by having a range of groups collecting the data, there are more opportunities to share the knowledge and detect diseases. And we are all urged to do our part to help protect native wildlife. ""If someone notices an animal on the side of the road, it's important to investigate and call the wildlife hotline and report it,"" Mr Kreiss said.

179,"Australia is in the middle of a critical minerals push, but what's really needed is local manufacturing",science,"  The critical minerals push is coming to fruition with the Dubbo Project, but could the government be doing more? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Dubbo Project in New South Wales' central west has been on a 20-year mission to dig up critical minerals and it's finally inching closer to being able to mine them. The Dubbo Project is now looking to finance its construction stage It received all necessary state and government approvals six years ago Critics says the federal government has been too slow to recognise the strategic importance of critical minerals The Dubbo Project is looking to mine a number of rare earth metals and critical minerals like zirconium, hafnium, titanium and neodymium, the products of which can be used in a number of industries, including clean energy, aerospace and some military technologies. Gill Savage, senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, says this makes the sector relevant to Australia's sovereignty. ""We know that from a defence perspective, high-tech air power is dependent on critical minerals and rare earth elements,"" Ms Savage said. ""So if we're going to stand as a leader geopolitically, we need to support ourselves in key areas."" You might not have heard of AdBlue, but you'll be all too aware of it if the supply shortage isn't sorted out. In the worst case scenario, Australia's economy could be brought to its knees. But, she says, Australia has been too slow on the uptake, and needs to move towards prioritising its own national interests, especially since the pandemic has exposed a number of supply chain issues. ""Prior to COVID, we had this complete trust in globalisation and just-in-time manufacturing and delivery,"" Ms Savage said. ""But, just recently we had shortage issues with a urea fertiliser and AdBlue [an additive for diesel engines], so we've had a lot of experiences that say we've been over-reliant on others."" The federal government has outlined the importance of moving up the critical minerals value chain. The clamour for Western nations to diversify away from dependence on Chinese markets and products has grown in recent years, with the federal government releasing an update to its Critical Minerals Strategy in March to do exactly that. Japan's ambassador to Australia has warned of the risks of dependence on China as he flags greater investment by Japanese companies in Australian resources. But Ms Savage says the fact that it has taken more than 20 years for the Dubbo Project to get going is a potential indication that successive governments have been asleep at the wheel for too long. The owner of the Dubbo Project, Australian Strategic Materials (ASM), says once mining starts — probably in 2025-26 — its mined material is slated to go overseas to the South Korean market. ASM general manager David Woodall says Korea is an automotive manufacturing powerhouse that is moving towards electric vehicles, while the demand for critical minerals in Australia is still relatively small. Ms Savage says it is this lack of local demand that needs to be rectified by the federal government in the national interest. But while the critical minerals push is happening across the Western world, there remain local concerns. The Dubbo Project has a tentative timeline with construction expected to begin next year. Central West Environment Council spokesperson Bev Smiles says it has been six years since the project received its approvals, yet it only presented a modification report, to get additional approval for changes to its water requirements, last month. ""This, to me, is the project trying to protect itself more from dry conditions given the recent drought,"" Ms Smiles said. As the country comes to terms with its role in climate change, Australia begins to harness its rich vanadium deposits for the first time. ""But, there's also the issue of extreme wet conditions as we've seen recently with the rains, and how that might impact all these buried residues."" Ms Smiles says radioactive uranium that is dug up and reburied, as well as large amounts of salt that will be trucked in for chemical processing, could be at risk of contaminating Dubbo's water. ""We want more consideration as to whether the area above Dubbo's drinking water supply is an appropriate place to be burying all this stuff,"" she said. In response, ASM said the mine followed the world's best practice in design and engineering when it came to storing waste materials. It said the containment mechanism used to store the waste products was in line with government regulations and designed to withstand a once-in-10,000-year flood.

180,How 'a magic night' discovery helped uncover these 'cute' and elusive reptiles,science,"  Night research helps scale up estimates of grey snake population in NSW floodplains Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The words ""cute"" and ""snake"" do not often go together, but that's exactly how the frog-eating grey snake is being described. The venomous snake has only been seen a handful of times in the past 65 years. But that has changed thanks to Charles Sturt University honours student Talia Schlen. Scouring the clay landscape on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River in the New South Wales Riverina at night with a torch fitted to her head, Ms Schlen came across the hard-to-spot reptile. ""It was super exciting. I found 30 individuals,"" she said. ""One night was a magic night. This is the thing about snakes: You'll find maybe one every so often but then, sometimes — and we don't know why — you'll see an unusual amount. ""I was very lucky this one night. I found nine in, like, a kilometre, which is cute. ""The snakes [give birth to live young] and I found some babies freshly popped out, ready to go looking for baby frogs."" Ms Schlen spent five weeks searching for the elusive snake, measuring them and compiling information for a species distribution list, similar to a map you would see in a bird watcher's guide. ""It is big, because we found them in areas that we hadn't seen before,"" she said. ""At this stage, it looks like I've found them in at least six different locations from where they'd been found previously,"" she said. The grey snake is listed as endangered in Queensland and by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Ms Schlen said the distribution list would be used to advocate for more research funding and protection for the animal. ""Often there's not enough money to do the science we want but, by having the snake listed as endangered, hopefully it'll improve it in research priorities,"" she said. Ms Schlen said that, although no-one had done extensive research in the region before, she was optimistic the rehabilitation of the Murrumbidgee flood plains was helping the elusive population to prosper. ""I'm hoping that, if the reason they've popped up again in the lower Murrumbidgee is because it's a flood-plain rehabilitation, it'll paint a bigger, better picture,"" she said. ""It's not hard, but it does take collaboration. ""I don't know if there are any more, but I'm certainly very keen to find out.""

181,Restoring Australia's lost shellfish reefs to reshape a vast underwater kingdom,science," ABC Rural Port Phillip Bay shellfish reef project a first step in restoring Australia's underwater kingdoms Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Several nautical miles offshore, a special diving boat is a mere speck in Port Phillip Bay. The bay, comprising almost 2,000 square kilometres, fans southwards from Melbourne, Australia's second-biggest city. Two divers carrying live shellfish are descending on an artificial reef, taking another small step in an ambitious reef restoration project — the largest yet undertaken in Australia. Known as Reef Builder, it is backed by federal and state governments and overseen by The Nature Conservancy. ""Our Commonwealth investment has produced 40 hectares of shellfish reefs, and it's a truly fantastic program,"" Environment Minister Sussan Ley said. Shellfish reefs were once prominent around much of the Australian coastline. Reef Builder is restoring marine habitats from Noosa in Queensland to Perth in Western Australia. In 2017, Port Phillip became the first of many planned future projects. ""It is a really ambitious project — we've got 13 sites and we're trying to link these together to re-form the forgotten southern reef, if you will, of these oyster reefs in all the bays and estuaries,"" marine scientist Simon Reeves said. Mr Reeves has been heavily involved in the labour-intensive and tricky work. Once a site for a reef is identified, a large barge is used to bring in huge limestone blocks that are lifted by a crane and dropped overboard. Within months they will become, quite literally, the building blocks of life. Divers then disperse juvenile shellfish onto the new reef site in a process called seeding. The tiny oysters attached themselves to scallop or oyster shells that have been salvaged from seafood wholesalers and restaurants, part of a recycling initiative called Shuck Don't Chuck. ""So they'll cement together and grow on top of each other over time so you won't see that reef base,"" Nature Conservancy marine scientist Simon Branigan said. The young oysters and mussels are grown at the Queenscliff Shellfish Hatchery, a state government-run facility on the western side of Port Phillip. The restoration project has been producing the angasi or native oyster, sometimes called the flat or mud oyster. Port Phillip Bay was once teeming with them, but in Melbourne's early days they were an all-too-convenient food source and the shellfish reefs were a nuisance to marine navigation. Oyster shells also provided the lime crucial to building the city's grand colonial buildings. Within decades the shellfish reefs were overfished or dredged to oblivion. ""They also burnt oyster shells and live oysters in lime kilns, so a lot of the historic buildings in Melbourne and elsewhere are built on the back of these shellfish reefs,"" Mr Branigan said. By the 1960s, dredging for scallops in the bay further reduced the population of angasi and blue mussels — it means the shellfish hatchery is crucial to the restoration project. ""This is really the linchpin of the restoration operation,"" Mr Branigan said. The scientists have had to discover much about the little-known and cryptic angasi oyster. Unlike the more common Sydney rock oyster, it broods its young internally and then, when conditions are suitable, releases them into the water. ""We started off with very little success; we maybe got 300,000 out there in the initial stages,"" hatchery manager Kim Weston said. ""Today, fast forward six years, we're producing 5 million, and we could probably go to 10 if we really wanted to but we're limited by space."" Twelve hectares of artificial reefs have been constructed in Port Phillip — the ultimate aim is an ambitious 100 hectares. Even if that is achieved, it will only represent a 10th of what was there at the time of European settlement. Rebuilding these underwater kingdoms is paying dividends; six years into the project and recreational anglers are catching legal-sized whiting and other species that were previously hard to find. But Bob Pearce from the Albert Park Yachting and Angling Club, which has been instrumental in the reef rebuild, believed there was more at stake than simply catching a feed of fish. ""It's never been only about the fish. It's really always been about the biodiversity and the number of different marine critters that are living on that location,"" he said. Marine scientists Simon Branigan and Simon Reeves are seeing a greater diversity of marine life every time they visit the reef sites. With an estimated 80 per cent of shellfish reefs lost worldwide — Mr Reeves believed the restoration of Port Phillip's reefs had come in the nick of time. ""I think we would really be the first nation to recover an ecosystem back from the brink of extinction,"" he said. Watch this story on ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm on Sunday, or on ABC iview.

182,"Meet the nurses who bought 12,000 apple trees to try something different",science,"  With no farming experience, this couple bought an apple orchard. Their gamble is paying off Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Chris and Emily Shipway's move to a nine-hectare apple orchard in the Adelaide Hills shocked a lot of people. ""Everyone literally thinks we're crazy for what we bought because it was significant. We bought an acreage with 12,000 apple trees and we didn't have any equipment,"" Chris says. The intensive care nurses from Adelaide met on night shift in 2016. Other than their work, they had in common a desire to live in the country. ""We both wanted some kind of Hills lifestyle, [but] we never thought this intense,"" Emily says. ""We'd never come from anything like this. I think that's the most surprising thing to people, they just expect we've come from this."" After two years of looking at cherries, vineyards and cattle properties, Emily and Chris settled on a commercial apple orchard at Lenswood in 2019. The couple moved to the property, known as @Lenswood Pick Your Own, with a push mower, ute, and then six-year-old daughter Daisy. It's fair to say their induction into farming in South Australia's apple capital has been a major learning curve. For the first two years, the orchard's previous owners leased back the trees. This is their first harvest running the show. And they're determined to make it work. It's a big task, as the couple continues to commute to Adelaide to work night shifts and meet the demands of their expanding family with one-year-old Charlie. When it comes to apples, Lenswood is the place to be. The small town grows 85 per cent of the state's production and nearly 10 per cent of the national crop. Many of the growers are fifth or sixth generation. That's why the Shipways' move shocked grower and industry consultant Susie Green. ""It's really rare for someone to come into the industry because it is so challenging ... particularly in this area where we have such steep terrain and small blocks,"" Susie says. ""Even the growers who have been doing it for many generations have to be at the top of their game to do well. ""So for someone to come in with no knowledge, no machinery, no equipment, is extremely challenging."" It's fair to say the couple's arrival was met with a fair amount of scepticism from local growers. ""Everyone looks at you like you're absolutely crazy, but then they warm to you,"" Chris, 37, says. Unlike others who have bought land to push out trees or run alpacas, the Shipways are keen to actually make a go at growing and selling apples. But it's harder than they expected. ""Nothing is a quick job. Something will break or just putting out the sprinklers [takes time],"" Emily, 31, says. ""You know, we're not talking about the little ones from Bunnings. Everything's this massive commercial scale for literally everything."" It all takes time and money. ""I didn't know that tractors cost so much money. I drove past farmers and thought 'oh yeah, that's a couple thousand bucks' and they're a couple hundred thousand bucks,"" Emily says. ""Speaking to other farmers, they get into it because it's handed down to them. [But] how do you actually get into farming? ""We went to uni, got told how to do our jobs and we did it. And there's support, there's books, there's courses, you have to be registered to a body. Whereas a farm, where do you go?"" On top of trying to grow a decent crop, they're expanding the orchard's operations. ""We're trying to get the boring apple to be something that people get really excited about,"" Emily says. ""We want to do some glamping. We want to do some weddings here, school excursions, pick your own, anything is possible."" Their entrepreneurship is particularly exciting for Susie Green, whose job involves encouraging growers to diversify their offerings. ""It was obvious they were looking to break the mould and not do what everyone else is doing,"" Susie says. ""They provide an alternate view, a different way of looking at things. So they're looking at the industry far more from a consumer perspective."" Given that most of the apple growers in Lenswood focus solely on fruit production, the Shipways have drawn inspiration from a nearby pear grower who's taken on agritourism. Fourth-generation grower Damian McArdle hasn't shied from doing things differently from his predecessors. ""In 2012, my wife and I started our own brand Paracombe Premium Perry. It was a diversification project to take fruit that wasn't any good for the fresh market, further process into juice and ciders,"" Damian says. After two one-in-100-year hail storms within a year, the couple opened their cellar door in 2018. ""There were a lot of people that didn't understand what we were trying to do and didn't believe it would work,"" Damian says. The cellar door, offering wood oven pizzas and live music for weekends and events, is now their insurance policy for a bad year of fruit. ""There's a completely different income source so if you do get a bad weather event you can rely on your cellar door to power through for the next 12 months,"" Damian says. While diversification isn't for everyone, Susie Green hopes Emily and Chris' lead will inspire other growers to step out. With successive hits of hail storms, bushfires and poor pricing due to oversupply nationally, it's a crucial time for the local industry to maintain growers. For some businesses that don't have that next generation coming through, the pressure is on. ""We're seeing, particularly in recent years, a number of orchards have been sold in the area to lifestyle blocks,"" Susie says. ""The industry needs some critical mass to remain viable."" Nowadays Emily and Chris are taken a bit more seriously. ""I had an apple grower the other day say to me in the post office, 'I find you really, really inspiring and you're doing an amazing job'. I just got in the car and wanted to cry because it meant so much,"" Emily says. And while challenging, their new lifestyle is already having a profound impact on their lives. Chris says often the hospital isn't a happy place. ""Nurses and doctors try and make it comfortable as best they can but I got sick of seeing people die. And apples grow,"" he says. ""They have a life cycle that you can see them come through and it's a beautiful thing to watch."" And after months of hard work, it appears to be paying off. The crop looks surprisingly good. ""I literally walk up to an apple tree and go 'Chris, they look like apples'. How dumb's that?"" Emily says. ""But we actually grew these, these are commercial grade apples. Like we're doing it, just like everyone else is doing it."" And they intend to keep doing it for a while yet. ""I'm not leaving here unless I'm pulled out of here in my coffin. I want a road named after us, even if it has to be our driveway,"" Emily says. ""I love that we're a part of this and we're phonies. We'll never be locals ever but our kids might be. ""We've done our bit for the place. We've brought new blood in and we're very proud of Lenswood.""

183,"How science is tackling this often unspoken, but common sports injury for women ",science,"  Research into breast injuries focuses on grassroots sport in effort to boost awareness Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog On the football field, the cricket pitch or the netball court, even the best-fitting bra can leave girls and women with breast soreness — or worse. It was something National Rugby League Women (NRLW) player Shaniah Power simply put up with in her early playing years. ""They can definitely end up a little bit tender after a game,"" Power said. ""I wish I knew more about these injuries when I began playing because I think a lot of damage could have been prevented. ""People say things to me all the time like, 'Does it hurt? Are you worried about it [my breasts]?'."" Research on breast health in sport is limited and in the past has been focused on elite athletes. But a new study by the University of Wollongong is directing its attention to community sport in an effort to raise awareness among amateur female players and prevent injuries. School of Medicine Associate Professor Deirdre McGhee, who was also co-founder and director at Breast Research Australia, said she wanted to fill the gap in knowledge at a community level. ""The strategy we use to improve the prevention and management will be different because community level sports do not have the same resources as elite athletes have,"" she said. Power wished she knew more about it years ago. ""I suffered an injury this NRLW season, where they suspected there might have been some slight tearing from the breast tissue,"" she said. ""At the time, I didn't report it [but] only recently, coming up to this level with my most recent injury, I reported that one. ""You can be quite self-conscious of it, and it doesn't feel nice when they don't feel secure."" The study was instigated by rugby union officials in Queensland's Darling Downs, where female participation has exploded in popularity. There are 150 women in senior ranks and about 600 teenage girls playing. Women in Downs Rugby coordinator Sue-Ann McGowan said she contacted researchers after witnessing an awkward encounter during an under 13 game when a ""little girl came off the field"". ""I got to see this really uncomfortable situation between her and the [male] coach,"" she said. ""She just said, 'Oh, I'm really sore, I just got hit [in the breasts]'. ""He [the coach] didn't know how to deal with that, or what to do or what to say, so I really felt for her and for him. ""I thought this is going to happen in every sport a woman ever does, let alone union."" At the elite level, a survey by Breast Research Australia at UOW found 58 per cent of players had endured previous contact injury to their breast. But a huge 90 per cent of those athletes did not report their injury. The UOW research team will survey players and officials in rugby union, rugby league and cricket. It will investigate the incidence and severity of breast pain and injury, bra-wearing behaviour and knowledge among female players. It then plans to develop strategies for each code to improve knowledge and behaviour and improve prevention and management. Dr McGhee said bras were ""like a shoe"". ""You could buy a fantastic running shoe, but if you bought it in the wrong size, then it's not going to work very well,"" she said. ""We need to have a woman in each club, maybe who will lead the change in terms of education sessions and breast support."" Dr McGhee said the Darling Downs rugby union code had embraced the initiative. ""This is a pioneer event and it's great that the organisers of Downs Rugby have been so proactive to get this together,"" she said. ""This is [the] first time in the world. ""There's no point being at the university, analysing data and publishing a peer-reviewed paper, if we don't actually create change at a community level. ""And the first step in that is to raise awareness that these injuries occur, so we can get athletes to report them."" The research team plans to present data from its findings in September.

184,Compostable nappies used to be a pipedream but this NSW council has proved their viability,science,"  NSW's Bega Valley compostable nappy trial success garners global attention Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog An innovative trial on the NSW far south coast may have succeeded in finding a solution to one of the world's biggest waste problems — nappies. The Bega Valley Shire Council undertook a trial in 2019 which provided 50 local families with compostable nappies to use instead of disposable ones. After use, the nappies were processed in the local Food Organics and Garden Organics (FOGO) facility and turned into compost rather than ending up in landfill. The council's waste coordinator Joley Vidau said the trial had now been deemed a success, which could lead to change across NSW and around the world. ""It definitely was a game changer,"" she said. ""There were so many people who were asking the question [about whether nappies could be composted] and no-one could crack it."" The Bega Valley Shire has become the first council in NSW to successfully trial the disposal of compostable nappies through its food and garden waste facility. Keira Proust reports. The NSW Environment Protection Authority has granted the results of the trial conditional approval, a state-wide first. It allows the Bega Valley Shire Council to use compostable products such as nappies in their commercial composting facility, however, due to the site reaching capacity, it's likely to take a number of years until it could happen locally. The trial's success doesn't just have local implications, it's also garnered the attention of councils and manufacturers around the world. ""A lot of the work we've done with our trial has been shared with other countries,"" Ms Vidau said. ""So, they're doing a trial similar to this in Indonesia off the back of our trial."" Families in Australia, such as Arian Manca's, could soon see more environmentally friendly nappies on supermarket shelves. The Manca family joined the trail after using mostly cloth nappies, however, cleaning and drying them was time-consuming. ""We loved the environmental aspect of the nappies being compostable,"" she said. She said having a compostable option was great for parents constantly juggling their time and consideration of the environment. ""A big thing for parents is the time factor, so you need something that is quick and simple and easy to use and doesn't take up too much time,"" she said. ""The compostable nappies certainly take up less time than the alternative of the cloth nappy."" The nappies approved by the EPA were made entirely of compostable material and used a reusable fabric band to secure them at the top. Consumer behaviour expert Professor Gary Mortimer from QUT's Business School said cost would be a major factor as to whether the product could become mainstream. ""If we can make those prices in line with mass-produced products there is more of a chance that consumers will make that purchase,"" Professor Mortimer said. He said as consumer demand grew, so would interest from manufacturers. ""Most manufacturers generally won't produce a product unless it's been tried and tested and there's an appetite for it,"" he said. ""Once there's demand then you'll find other manufacturers start to move towards those types of products."" It is estimated more than five million disposable nappies end up in landfills across Australia every day. However, the issue was one many countries grappled with. GDiapers co-founder Kim Graham-Nye has worked in the global nappy manufacturing industry for more than 20 years and said, while change had happened in that time, it was not quick enough. ""Sustainability has shifted dramatically over the past 20 years,"" she said. ""Now, it is imperative that we make changes to how we make, how we produce, how we consume, and how we interact with the natural world."" While more brands were offering eco-friendly incontinence products, only one brand in Australia — Tasmania-based company Eenee — made entirely compostable nappies. These products were used during the Bega Valley Shire trial. Ms Vidau was hopeful the success of their trial would encourage more manufacturers to start making compostable products. ""[The trial] made other councils and organic processing facilities and, most importantly, manufacturers of disposable nappies realise that there was an alternative,"" she said. Ms Graham-Nye said it was important consumers continued to check products to ensure they were certified environmental products. ""Brands do everything they can to mislead consumers, sadly, for their sales,"" she said. ""So, unless something can be in your own compost bin or can go into your council FOGO that's been approved and proved it can compost, then it's just green-washing.""

It is SpaceX's first private charter flight to the orbiting lab after two years of carrying astronauts there for NASA. The Ax-1 mission, a collaboration between private companies SpaceX and Axiom Space — which plans to build a private space station — launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Arriving at the space station on Saturday are an American, a Canadian and an Israeli who run investment, real estate and other companies. They are paying $US55 million ($71 million) apiece for the rocket ride and accommodations, all meals included. Russia has been hosting tourists at the space station — and before that the Mir station — for decades. Just last fall, a Russian movie crew flew up, followed by a Japanese fashion tycoon and his assistant. NASA is finally getting into the act after years of opposing space station visitors. ""It was a hell of a ride and we're looking forward to the next 10 days,"" said former NASA astronaut and chaperone Michael Lopez-Alegria on reaching orbit. The visitors' tickets include access to all but the Russian portion of the space station — they will need permission from the three cosmonauts on board to visit those areas.

186,Buzz about new Royal Australian Mint $2 coin,science,"  Royal Australian Mint releases $2 honey bee coin to mark bicentenary of the industry in Australia Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The Royal Australian Mint has released a new coin, and there's a special buzz about it. Marking 200 years since the insect's introduction to Australia, the $2 collector's coin features two honey bees, commemorating ""both the remarkable creatures and conscientious beekeepers"". ""We've got a role at the Mint to help tell the stories of Australia through coins. So we're always on the lookout for significant events, anniversaries and organisations that we can commemorate through coins,"" Royal Australian Mint chief executive Leigh Gordon said. ""The coin that we have, I think it's a particularly beautiful coin. It's got a couple of the honey bees, it's got Australian flowers and trees around the edges, and it's got a really rich sort of honey like coloured honeycomb in the centre. ""It really is a very attractive sight."" Mr Gordon said the honey bee coin had been in the works ""for about 14 months"". ""We've got a product development team here at the Mint that's putting their thinking caps on all the time. But we also get suggestions from the public,"" he said. In this coin's case, the Mint worked with the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council on both the concept and the execution. ""We [wanted to] capture the essence of what they thought was important in the coin,"" Mr Gordon said. ""And then we go through the process of actually designing something that looks beautiful, that we can manufacture here, that would attract people's attention and is of interest."" The honey bee coin is what is known as an ""uncirculated coin"" — so it's not one you will find in your spare change drawer. Rather, it is created as a collector's item that you have to purchase from the Mint — and Mr Gordon said one in four Australians considered themselves coin collectors. ""A lot of them describe what they see in their change, but certainly a number of people go out of their way to collect a particular theme or a particular type of coin,"" he said. ""Hopefully it'll strike a chord, particularly with those that have an interest in the honey industry — and it's a significant industry in Australia."" The Mint described the honey bee as small, yet mighty, ""producing delicious honey and contributing to the country’s agricultural success by pollinating crops"". And Australia's honey industry is indeed significant. ""There are about 20,000 beekeepers, somewhere in the order of 640,000 hives, and they make about 30,000 tonnes of honey each year,"" Mr Gordon said. ""So it's quite a quite a big industry, and that honey goes all over the world. So it's good to commemorate something like this."" Trevor Weatherhead, chair of the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council, said the humble honey bee is responsible for pollinating about two-thirds of Australia's crops. ""We all know we have the good 100 per cent Australian honey that's out there, people can enjoy that,"" he said. ""But our biggest value is in the horticulture and agricultural industries, where it's been estimated that about $14.2 billion worth of crops that are grown in Australia rely on honey bees for pollination. ""They're some of the crops like almonds or watermelons, rockmelons, honeydews those sort of things. No bees, they don't get a crop."" Mr Weatherhead said the commercial bee hive population was ""fairly steady"", and the number of registered hives in Australia was increasing thanks to recreational beekeepers, who have hives in their backyard. ""During the pandemic, there seems to have been a reasonable increase in the number of people keeping hives as a hobby. They sort of suddenly discovered that there's something that they can do [for bees] at home and there's been a big increase that way,"" he said. ""They probably don't realise it but they're pollinating a lot of the backyard veggie gardens, whether it's something like zucchinis or if they're growing cucumbers or watermelons, as well as getting a bit of honey."" The Australian Mint regularly releases coins to commemorate or honour different events and people. In 2020, they released a ""donation dollar"" — a legal tender designed to be given to people in need. Then, in 2021, a coin honouring Indigenous military service featuring artwork from Kalkadoon artist Chern'ee Sutton was released. ""Some recent really successful coins that we've had have been around the history of steam engines in Australia,"" Mr Gordon added. ""We had a great coin last year that recognised the 50th anniversary of the Tamworth country music festival, and we obviously have honoured our first responders and our frontline workers through recent coins."" Mr Gordon said a key component of each coin produced was the storytelling aspect. ""It is currency as a way of helping tell the stories of Australia,"" he said. ""Capturing that, we take that role really seriously here at the Mint. ""It makes the people that we have working here — the passionate designers, the marketing people in manufacturing — it really gives them I guess a bit of a buzz in return, to do something that's appreciated by the Australian public."" Mr Weatherhead said the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council hoped the coin would raise awareness of the importance of bees. ""We've been amazed at the response,"" he said. ""Those avid coin collectors, well, they've got something else to add to their collection now that's got a very good story behind it. ""And hopefully they'll realise that and every time they look at it, they'll think of the honey bee and think of how it helps feed us all.""

187,"Older than first thought, new dating method shows Yirra sacred Indigenous site at least 50,000 years old",science,"  Yirra sacred Indigenous site in eastern Pilbara older than first thought, thanks to new dating methods Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog New archaeological findings from a sacred site have proven the Yinhawangka people's existence in WA's eastern Pilbara region date back more than 50,000 years. Analysis of stone tools, charcoal and bone collected from the Yirra rock shelter at Rio Tinto's Eastern Channar mine, 17 kilometres south-east of Paraburdoo, has proven Yinhawangka people lived in the region for much longer than initially thought. The excavation project was led and commissioned by Yinhawangka Aboriginal Corporation (YAC) in collaboration with Archae-aus heritage consultants and researchers from the University of Western Australia and received funding from Rio Tinto. YAC chairperson Halloway Smirke said the evidence helped prove what traditional owners knew all along. ""I'm still in shock myself, to find out everything that we were saying all the time and now there's science to it and [we're in a] better position now to preserve this for future generations,"" he said. ""It's bloody great, especially where Yirra is now and how those languages have been changed historically since colonisation. ""Now we're in a position where we can start bringing some of those tracks back."" Archae-aus excavation project manager and director Fiona Hook originally excavated the Yirra site with her late husband, Dr Bruce Veitch, in 2000. ""Back then the only way we could date the sites properly was using radiocarbon dating and so that got us to 23,000 [years],"" Ms Hook said. During the excavation of Yirra in October last year, the team used optically stimulated luminescence dating, a method that Ms Hook said had taken 20 years to refine. She said this method was more accurate than radiocarbon dating at showing the age of archaeological sites and artefacts. ""That's now revolutionising our evidence for the first people arriving in Australia and also pushing back sites into a much older regime,"" she said. ""This site is now older than 50 [thousand] … we'll be able to, in the next few months, determine how much older than 50 the site is. ""It's now one of the oldest sites in the arid zone, and also one of the oldest sites in Australia."" Ms Hook said she knew the site was special since she first excavated it 20 years ago. ""Aboriginal people used this site repeatedly during the height of the last Ice Age … there are no other sites around in the Pilbara that have this degree of evidence,"" she said. She said it was ""overwhelming"" to go back to the site and find evidence it was even older than initially thought. Dr Veitch's last project he worked on before passing away from motor neurone disease in 2005 was a report into the initial excavation of Yirra. Ms Hook said being able to go back to the site and get the answers they had been wanting for more than 20 years made her feel ""quite vindicated"". ""I got to go back and excavate with the grandchildren of the elders that I worked on the site with 20 years ago,"" she said. ""I also got to take my son, Conall, up with us … so to have him there as a memory of Bruce in the site was very special for me."" Ms Hook said it was an emotional experience. ""When we packed up on the last day of the excavation, I was the last person up in the shelter … and I just sat down on a boulder and just kind of had a bit of a cry, that we'd finally done it. The results are in, they've exceeded what we were hoping,"" she said. Mr Smirke said he hoped research collaboration into ancient sites and artefacts would continue. ""This is a great big step moving forward as a united front — industry, government, and traditional owners working together,"" he said.

188,Wild weather uncovers Australia's best preserved shipwreck 'Buster',science,"  Wild weather on the NSW Mid North Coast uncovers 'Buster', Australia's best-preserved shipwreck Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It's hard to find any positives to the recent flooding and heavy seas in northern NSW, but in the mid north coast town of Woolgoolga, the wild weather has resulted in a welcome visitor. 'Buster' the shipwreck is usually mostly covered by sand, only remerging from time to time when tide and surf conditions are right. The recent weather event on the NSW Mid North Coast has exposed the aged remains of the vessel- considered one of the best-preserved shipwrecks in the country. ""It's one of the few historic shipwrecks out of over 700 on Australian waters in coastal zones that actually sits on the beach,"" Tim Smith, director of Heritage Assessment NSW said. ""It's just an amazing time capsule"" Mr Smith said. Buster's full exposure used to be a more rare event, but Mr Smith said that since 2009, the vessel had been uncovered almost annually, which may lead to an acceleration to its deterioration. The once impressive 310-tonne, 39-metre tall timber barquentine was built in Nova Scotia, Canada where it made port at Woolgoolga Jetty in 1893 to load timber bound for New Zealand. Heritage records recount a wall of water that smashed the side of the boat breaking the anchor chain and sweeping it out to sea on February 17, 1893. The Buster was later driven ashore and became a total wreck at the mouth of Woolgoolga Lake on March 8. The wreck is protected by heritage legislation; it's an offence to move, damage, disturb or destroy the wreck or anything associated with it, including 'relics' from the ship. The latest unearthing of Buster has sparked conservation concerns; Mr Smith said the increasingly frequent appearance of the wreck had meant more exposure to the elements. ""From the last time it was exposed last year the vessel was out of the sand in the water for quite a long time and got a bit of algae growth"" ""It's all part of the shipwreck experience, they do generally break down over time"" A spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment said the sites of shipwrecks are constantly changing, meaning the environmental effects that may cause them to deteriorate over time is inevitable. ""Local communities can assist the conservation of these shipwrecks by reporting changes to their state of territory heritage agency to maintain the preservation of these historic sites"" said the spokesperson.

189,'Extremely rare' conservation success story as sea lion net deaths drop by 98 per cent,science,"  Fishing net deaths of endangered sea lions drastically reduced in SA Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog South Australia's endangered sea lion population has been given a chance to bounce back after a decade-long marine conservation program substantially reduced their deaths in fishing nets. Australian sea lions are on the country's endangered list after widespread hunting in the 18th and 19th centuries and had been struggling to rebound, with up to 256 killed in gillnets in Commonwealth-managed fisheries each year up until 2010. In response, the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) and Humane Society International worked with federal and state governments, scientists and the fishing industry to develop the Australian Sea Lion Management Strategy. The strategy includes gillnet fishing exclusion zones around all sea lion breeding colonies, cameras on fishing boats and the introduction of closures in parts of the fishery if a certain number of sea lions were caught. Crucially, it also includes independent observation of what fishers are catching, by checking the data they report is accurate so that fishery managers can put closures in place when needed. SA Research and Development Institute professor Simon Goldsworthy said researchers estimated a 98 per cent reduction in sea lion bycatch mortality in the gillnet fishery since the strategy was implemented a decade ago. ""Not only has bycatch mortality been reduced to levels that should enable sea lion populations to recover, there has been an almost complete transition from gillnets to longlines in the sea lion management zone and fishing catches have returned to pre-bycatch management levels,"" he said. ""In the context of managing marine mammal bycatch globally, it is an extraordinary outcome. ""This kind of conservation and management outcome is extremely rare and sets an important precedent both nationally and internationally."" AMCS campaign manager Tooni Mahto said there had been ""a lot of work"" in the past 15 to 20 years by scientists, fishers and the government to identify the issues and come up with solutions in Commonwealth waters. There was initially ""fierce resistance"" from fishers to the implementation of regulations, but Ms Mahto said things had progressed since then. ""It's also fair to say the Australian community has really got on board with a desire for their seafood to be caught without this extreme cost for Australia's really unique and endangered wildlife,"" she said. The conservation society now hopes a similar program could be expedited in waters off Western Australia, the only other state where the endangered sea lions live. ""What we're still seeing is gillnetting happening in Western Australia, without this crucial [program],"" she said. ""There's a commitment and a requirement by the WA government to have a data validation system in place by 2024, but what we want to see is that really ramped up. ""We want to see that data validation system in place as soon as possible."" ABC South East SA will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Friday. Sign up to stay connected.

190,Three billionaires paid $70m each to go to the space station — but they say they're not tourists,science," Science First fully private crew set to blast off on historic trip to the International Space Station Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Commercial space travel is about to go to a new level — literally — as the first all-private crew prepares to blast off to the International Space Station (ISS). The Ax-1 mission, which is a collaboration between SpaceX and another company Axiom Space, is due to launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida around 1:17am (AEST) tomorrow morning (April 9) at the earliest. On board the SpaceX Dragon capsule will be a veteran astronaut and three billionaire entrepreneurs from the US, Canada and Israel, who've each paid an estimated $US55 million ($71 million) for the ride. The all-male crew will spend eight days at the ISS before returning to Earth. The ISS has previously welcomed a few private visitors. The first was US billionaire Dennis Tito in 2001, the most recent were a Japanese billionaire and his producer. But this is the first entirely private mission to the ISS. And it's a taste of things to come as countries make way for companies in space and the ISS is replaced with commercial space stations. The low-Earth orbit economy is booming, says Phil McAlister, director of NASA's commercial spaceflight division. ""[Commercialisation is] something we've been working towards at NASA for many years, starting with cargo, then crew, and now private astronauts, and then hopefully soon commercial low-Earth orbit destinations in the 2030 time frame after the ISS retires,"" he said. Let's fly through some facts about the mission and where it fits in with the future of space travel. The commander of the mission, Michael López-Alegría, is adamant the crew are astronauts, not tourists. Axiom's vice-president of business development also happens to be an astronaut who has flown on three space shuttle missions and spent six months on the ISS in 2006. ""I'm excited about going back into space,"" he said. Last year, a number of companies sent tourists who'd paid thousands of dollars on short stints either to the edge of space, or into orbit. But the Ax-1 mission will be ""very different,"" Mr López-Alegría claims. ""I think there's an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Ax-1 is about."" Mr López-Alegría, mission pilot Larry Connor, and their crewmates Mark Pathy and Eytan Stibbe, will be working with a number of institutes on more than 25 projects, including stem cell research and experimenting with spacecraft self-assembly technologies. They will also ferry completed experiments from the ISS back to Earth when they splash down 10 days after launch. Yes and no. The crew will fly onboard the SpaceX Dragon capsule, which has now ferried three crews of astronauts to the ISS. But this time, the take-off and landing logistics will be handled by Axiom and SpaceX, not NASA. ""NASA involvement is limited and focused on the ISS,"" Mr McAlister said. ""Once it gets close, then NASA has responsibility for the safety of the ISS, as well as crew members. ""When they dock they become part of the ISS crew under charge of NASA."" Although NASA will be hands off for take-off and landing, Mr López-Alegría said flying for a company rather than a country didn't feel any different. ""The focus is always safety and mission success,"" he said. ""I do have some different responsibilities because my crewmates are my crewmates first and foremost, but they are also the company’s customers."" The crew has undergone at least 700 hours of training. This included safety drills for the ascent and landing of the SpaceX capsule and on the ISS, as well as training to do their experiments onboard the space station. Professional astronauts do about 45 weeks of training just to be chosen for the NASA astronaut program, and then a lot more training once they are selected to perform specialised tasks such as spacewalks. But there are some overlaps between training regimes. For example, the SpaceX training is the same for private astronauts as professional astronauts. And even through Mr López-Alegría previously logged one of the longest stints on the ISS (215 days), he had to do a refresher course. ""I was thinking [the ISS training] would be a little routine, but so much of the station has changed, and the rest of it I forgot, that it was like starting over again,"" he said. Once onboard, the crew will be shown around the station, go through the usual welcome ceremony and safety briefings, and get familiar with how to do daily tasks such as meal prep and using the water system. And there will be some luxuries. They will tuck into tasty meals designed by two-Michelin-star chef José Andrés. On the menu is arroz Estelle Valencia, a classic Spanish rice dish; secreto de cerdo con pisto, a prized cut of Ibérico pork with tomatoes, onions, eggplant and peppers; and chicken and mushroom paella. And if something goes wrong on the space station, they are not expected to fix anything, says Dana Weigel, deputy manager of NASA's ISS program. ""If the the toilet won't flush, one of our government astronauts will deal with that."" This is the first of four missions Axiom has planned to the ISS (and just in case you're thinking you might like a ticket, the first three flights are already fully booked). The second flight, projected to launch sometime in the second half of 2022 or first half of 2023, is also planned to spend eight days aboard the ISS. The next two missions, to launch sometime after 2023, will spend 30 days on the ISS. Eventually, Axiom plans to have at least one person living full-time in a commercial section of the space station. In January 2020, Axiom won a contract to build two inflatable modules to add to the space station. The company plans to send the first module up in 2024. The idea is that the modules will become part of a commercial standalone space station when the ISS is retired in 2030. Three other companies, Blue Origin, Nanoracks and Northrop Grumman, are also in competition to design a commercial space station to replace the ISS. The clock is ticking for the International Space Station, which will meet its watery demise in roughly nine years' time. The first flight would give Axiom the opportunity to test out its business case for commercial operations, said Aude Vignelles, chief technology officer of the Australian Space Agency, which is not involved in the mission. ""It's a bit of a test of the market and what people expect because when they come back, they will say, 'this was great, this was not so great' and [the company] may have to think a bit more about their design or proposition."" It will also be a test of how commercial crews interact on the space station and provide some insight into the design of the future modules, she added. ""When you look at how busy [the ISS] is, you have to be careful not to bump into anything or not to interrupt other missions. ""It's not been designed for non-professional astronauts and I think that's the challenge for Axiom — that they are making sure they are designing something that is made for anyone to go to."" NASA is keen to open up the ISS to companies and support future space ventures. Ms Vignelles said the commercialisation of low Earth orbit space also opened up opportunities for Australia to provide expertise in areas such as communications, navigation, monitoring and medicine. There may even be an astronaut program in the future. But the commercialisation of space also comes with a downside. ""The low Earth orbits are more and more contested so we are going to have to be very cautious ... making sure we know what is in orbit and making sure there are no collisions and monitoring what's happening,"" she said. ""There are more and more manoeuvres that the space station needs to do to avoid debris. ""If we are not careful ... and put some rules around spacecraft being launched ... we may reach a stage where it's going to be difficult to use any orbit."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Andrew Dempster, director of the Australian Centre for Space Engineering at UNSW, agreed. ""The orbit that the space station is in is getting more crowded,"" Professor Dempster said. SpaceX, for instance, is putting up Starlink satellites above the space station, and they must also come back down through that zone when they deorbit. ""If there were lots of habitats and lots of low Earth orbit satellites, then there are likely to be more collisions,"" he said. The Chinese government recently complained that SpaceX Starlink satellites had come close to its space station. ""If we start having collisions happening in low Earth orbit, that will set us all back."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

191,"After years of smashing particles together, physicists have finally found something that doesn't fit",science," Science Standard Model of physics challenged by most precise measurement of W boson particle yet Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog New measurements of a subatomic particle provide the strongest hint yet that the leading theory of quantum physics that explains our universe may be missing a fundamental element, scientists say. That theory —  the Standard Model of particle physics — describes how a set of subatomic particles and forces interact to make up the world as we see it. But the model is not perfect. For example, it can not explain the existence of phenomena such as dark matter, which makes up 84 per cent of matter in the cosmos, or gravity. So scientists around the world have been smashing particles together to see if there are new calculations or elements that can be added to the Standard Model that can explain these mysteries. Ten years after one of those experiments in the US ended, scientists from the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) collaboration have released the most precise measurements yet of the W boson particle. Their results, published today in the journal Science, indicate the force-carrying particle is far heavier than was predicted by the Standard Model. Head of the collaboration Ashutosh Kotwal, from Duke University, said the result suggested the Standard Model needed much more than a simple tweak to the complex calculations that predict each particle's mass. ""This is the largest crack in this beautiful theory,"" Professor Kotwal said. ""This means that a missing component [such as a new particle or force] might be out there in nature and this is the first clear evidence of it."" But only time and new experiments by other colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider also measuring the mass of the W boson will be able to tell, he added. The W boson carries the weak nuclear force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The interaction of the W boson with other particles via the weak nuclear force causes the radioactive decay of particles such as neutrons in the nucleus of an atom into other particles such as protons, and vice versa. This process enables the Sun and other stars to shine, and creates heavier elements out of lighter ones. Because of the way the W boson interacts with other particles, it is central to the Standard Model. ""You can change the Standard Model in many ways, different ways, and all of them have some type of effect on this boson's mass,"" Professor Kotwal said. That was one of the reasons the collaboration chose to measure the W boson's mass. ""You really, really want to measure the W boson as precisely as possible to put the Standard Model under the stress test,"" Professor Kotwal said. ""Our precision is twice as good as any other experiment that has ever been done."" The international team conducted their experiments at the Tevatron particle accelerator in Illinois between 2002 and 2011. They sent groups of protons — subatomic particles with a positive charge — whizzing around a 4-kilometre loop at high speed to smash into groups of their antiparticle equivalent, which have a negative charge. ""There's a lot of energy in the protons and the antiprotons and all of that comes flying out,"" Professor Kotwal said. ""And every once in a while there is a W boson getting produced out of one of those smashes."" The mass of the W boson is calculated by the energy released as the particle decays using Einstein's famous equation E=mc2. Precise measurement of the W boson in 2012 by the Fermilab team pointed to the mass of the elusive Higgs boson particle, which was detected shortly after by physicists at the Large Hadron Collider. The discovery of the Higgs boson particle, which gives all other particles mass, completed the Standard Model. But after the Higgs was discovered, there was no more wiggle room in the mathematical model for the mass of the W boson to change. That is why the latest measurements, based on the complete 10 years of data, were surprising. The analysis, which took 10 years to complete, measured the W boson at 80,433.5 megaelectronvolts, plus or minus 9.4. That is around 70 to 85 MeV higher than the Standard Model predicts. The large discrepancy ""really makes one's ears prick up"", said Ray Volkas, a theoretical particle physicist at the University of Melbourne, who was not one of the 400-strong Fermilab team. ""If the result is correct, there is a probability of only one part in a million million that the Standard Model value for the W boson is correct, so essentially a zero probability."" Professor Volkas said the measurement strengthened the case for the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. Every time physicists find a new particle, the Standard Model gets one step closer to becoming a Super Model. The W boson is not the only particle that bucks predictions. Last year, physicists detected discrepancies in the magnetic properties of another elementary particle called the muon, and yet another, called the bottom quark, has also been observed acting differently to how it should. ""It's not at the point where physicists are jumping up and down and saying they have discovered physics beyond the Standard Model, but it's certainly a very interesting pattern of apparent deviations from Standard Model predictions,"" Professor Volkas said. ""So this new result from the W boson mass really adds in a surprising way to that story."" Over the years, physicists have been exploring a number of hypotheses to explain the questions of the cosmos that can not be answered by the Standard Model. ""There's quite a swag of new physics possibilities that could explain this new result, if indeed it is a real discrepancy,"" Professor Volkas said. Supersymmetry — an extension of the Standard Model where every particle has a much heavier super particle — is one potential option. ""One of the things [supersymmetry] can do is change the way the W boson mass is computed and bring it more into line with this present measurement,"" Professor Volkas said. Physicists have long believed this model could provide a plausible explanation for things the Standard Model can not explain, such as dark matter. But so far, no evidence of supersymmetry particles has been detected in experiments. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Other possibilities the result could point to include an extension of the Higgs field of energy, or additional forces or particles such as dark photons. The quest to unravel nature's principles is like a great treasure hunt, Professor Kotwal said. ""We are always looking for treasure and once in a while, somebody finds something. ""We are not going to stop thinking about this."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

192,'It blew me away': Rare white kangaroo spotted in outback Queensland,science,"  Elusive white kangaroo a sight for sore eyes on outback Queensland station Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog In outback Queensland, you can normally tell a tourist from a local by how they react to seeing a kangaroo. The iconic native marsupial may draw gasps and exclamations from excited travellers, but for those who live on the land, kangaroos are often just part of the scenery. However, that wasn't the case on a sunny Wednesday afternoon outside of Longreach this week. ""I was just out with my husband, we were dropping some rams back to the paddock, and there was a white kangaroo,"" said Sarah Kinnon, who lives on Nogo Station where the sighting occurred. ""It was pretty incredible to see it, if you put a white sheet of paper next to it, that's how white it was. ""It blew me away really."" A white kangaroo has been spotted on the property 15 kilometres from Longreach before, six months ago, but Sarah was not going to miss her chance to photograph the elusive marsupial. ""It was all a bit rushed really, we didn't see him for long,"" Mrs Kinnon said. ""I just chucked my daughter to my husband, got my camera and that's about all I had time for."" When a peculiarly pigmented creature with white fur, feathers or scales is seen in the wild, they are often labelled albino. But Queensland Museum Curator of Vertebrates Paul Oliver said that did not appear to be the case here. ""Just looking at the picture, it looks to have black eyes, it's hard to see for sure but that suggests it's not an albino,"" Dr Oliver said. ""You can have true albino, which you need to look for pink eyes, or sometimes there's another type of mutation called leucism where sometimes they'll have black eyes. The Griffith University lecturer said it was quite likely that this was the same white kangaroo that was seen on the property six months ago. ""Especially because it survived to adulthood,"" Dr Oliver said. ""Usually they don't survive, because obviously they stand out, if they're albino they can't see properly, their melanin's not protecting them. ""I'd say it might become a little bit of a local identity, the distinctive white kangaroo."" Nogo Station's white kangaroo has defied the odds already to make it this far, a trend that Mrs Kinnon would love to see continue. ""We just hope it doesn't end up in a shooter's sights, or in front of a car,"" said Mrs Kinnon. ""We just hope he sticks around and some more people can see him.""

193,Telstra's anti-scam SMS filter aims to stop dodgy texts from reaching your phone. So how does it work?,science," Science Telstra rolls out SMS scam filter in response to surge in dodgy mobile phone texts Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Telstra is responding to a surge in scam messages on its network with a filter designed to block the texts before they reach mobile devices. Scammers have been increasingly targeting Australians with dodgy malicious texts that employ a range of clever gambits to trick people into handing over sensitive information — even to send money. According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) ScamWatch, last year Australians lost $100 million to phone scams — that's calls and texts — up from $48 million in 2020. Telstra says reports of malicious texts to Android devices increased from 50 in 2020 to 11,000 the following year. In the past year, it says it has blocked more than 100 million scam calls. So, how does the scam SMS filter work and why has it taken so long for text messages to get a technology that email has had for years? Telstra hasn't said exactly how the technology works, other than it automatically scans text messages for suspicious content and characteristics. In a post on its website announcing the filter, Telstra said: ""We're applying knowledge of what scam text messages look like to block them at the network level. ""Automatic machine scanning picks suspicious content such as malicious links and combines this with other patterns and characteristics such as the time, sender, the number of messages sent and the recipient."" It's also not yet clear how effective the filter will be. Telstra says it's been testing the feature in a pilot program with 2,500 employees for the past three months, and participants reported ""a reduction in the number of scam SMS messages they received"". Other networks overseas have reported success with anti-scam filters. EE, a UK telecoms provider, introduced an anti-spam filter in July 2021. In the three months that followed, it blocked more than 42 million spam and scam texts and saw an 85 per cent drop in customer reports of scam SMS. Paul Haskell-Dowland, an expert in computing and security from Edith Cowan University, said the filter would work like the ones that sift spam from your email inbox. ""It will look at volumes of messages to see if thousands of messages are originating from one mobile phone number,"" he said. ""And it will look at the content of the message and determine whether it's a format it's seen before and classified as spam."" Messages that prove hard to automatically classify may be manually checked, he added. If that happens, Telstra said, ""the details of the recipients will remain masked"". Though welcome, Telstra's spam filter is an ""incredibly late decision"", Professor Haskell-Dowland said. More than a decade ago, email spam clogging up inboxes was having a ""very real impact"" on business, whereas the recent surge in malicious SMS has generally been an ""end-user problem"" — that is, a problem for individual customers, but not for businesses themselves. Eventually, however, mounting public and government pressure has led to telecoms providers doing something about the problem, Professor Haskell-Dowland said. ""I suspect there wasn't the commercial drive to address the problem,"" he said. ""It's reached a stage where it's so prolific — we all get these messages every single day so everyone is familiar with them — and with the dollar figure in scam losses rising, I suspect there was pressure from government to actually do something."" In December 2020, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) established an industry code aimed at reducing the number of scam calls. The Reducing Scam Calls code, developed in partnership with the telco industry, sets out processes for identifying, tracing, blocking, and otherwise disrupting scam calls. It was a direct recommendation of the ACMA's Combating Scams Action Plan, published in November 2019. Labor wants to target social media companies profiting from scammers and establish a national anti-scam centre. That plan included a proposal to develop enforceable obligations for telco providers to ""implement and update SMS filtering technology"" by the second quarter of 2020. The ACCC has welcomed Telstra's announcement of an anti-spam SMS filter. ""The ACCC is pleased to see providers making steps to meet their obligations under the Reducing Scam Calls Code,"" a spokesperson said. ""We will continue to monitor the rates of text messages scams received by the public to gauge the effectiveness of the measures."" The ACCC's ScamWatch saw a 124 per cent surge in SMS scam reports in the 12 months to February 2022. In that period, reported financial losses from SMS scams increased more than fivefold. Want even more science, health and tech? Join the conversation on Facebook. The real figure is probably higher, an ACCC spokesperson said. ""From previous research the ACCC has undertaken, under-reporting is prevalent across all scam types, so we can only assume that there are many more people being affected by these scams and are not reporting them."" Losses from SMS scams are dwarfed by those from phone calls. Of the $100 million Australians lost to phone scams in 2021, SMS scams accounted for 10 per cent. The pandemic has seen more people working from home and becoming isolated from those around them, which has made them vulnerable to scammers, experts say. The last federal election saw Clive Palmer send unsolicited texts to millions of voters as part of his campaign. With another election soon to be announced, you may be wondering if the new filter will stop these texts, or those from another politician or party. The short answer is that it won't, Professor Haskell-Dowland said. Federal legislation governing spam via electronic communications has an exemption for political campaign material, so long as it's not of a commercial nature. ""The Clive Palmer messages fall into the category of electioneering, so it's perfectly legal to send out what many would consider to be spam messages."" If you're with a third-party provider that uses the Telstra network, your messages may still be filtered, depending on the agreement between Telstra and the provider. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. Third-party providers are those that offer a telecoms service but don't have their own physical network infrastructure — instead, they piggyback on one of the Telstra, Optus or Vodafone networks. If you're with Optus or Vodafone, it's likely you'll soon have a spam filter too, Professor Haskell-Dowland said. ""I think what we'll see is a cascade effect, now that one major provider has introduced a filter. ""Over time this will become the norm, much as it has done with email."" A Vodafone spokesperson said the company introduced a ""sophisticated SMS firewall"" in 2020. “Our system has blocked more than 522 million scam text messages in the past year alone,"" they said. ""In the same period, we have also identified and blocked more than 26 million scam calls from reaching our customers."" Optus said it already had ""advanced filtering and machine learning in [its] SMS systems"". ""While we don't talk publicly about our security measures, we are pleased more of the industry is now implementing similar systems,"" a spokesperson said. ""Since December 2020, Optus has already blocked more than 230 million scam calls."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

194,"It's often mistaken for algae, but could it help sustain life on Mars?",science,"  Is life on Mars a duckweed diet away? Not quite, but it could advance the cause of space travel Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Adelaide's River Torrens has, in recent years, earned a reputation for being about as friendly to animal life as the planet Mars is suitable for human living. But the Torrens — or, at least, an aquatic plant that is commonly found on its surface — has been recruited for a study into how humans could one day live long and prosper upon the red planet. Duckweed, also known as water lentil, is being touted not only as a partial solution to the problem of getting to Mars, but also to the problem of how humans survive there. ""People often mistake it for an algae, and think maybe it's an algal bloom on the water but actually it's more closely related to land plants like wheat and barley,"" bio-scientist Jenny Mortimer told ABC Radio Adelaide's Stacey Lee and Nikolai Beilharz. ""Rowing clubs are a bit annoyed by it, having to paddle through it, but actually it's a perfectly normal thing, it doesn't release any toxins so it's not dangerous at all."" Associate Professor Mortimer is running a project with PhD students at the University of Adelaide looking at duckweed's many potent properties, and its suitability as a form of sustenance for human life and basis of future civilisation. ""If humans want to do long-term space exploration — so going beyond the space station, but [also] maybe living on the surface of the Moon or even going to Mars — then one of the biggest problems is food, because you just simply can't take everything you need with you,"" Associate Professor Mortimer said. ""We've done some calculations and if you send a crew of four people to Mars, it's about a three-year round trip, that's 10 tonnes of food and that doesn't even [take] into account trying to make sure the food is nutritiously stable across those three years. ""One solution is that maybe you want to grow some of the food as you go with you, but trying to do that in a small, confined space on a space shuttle is quite challenging so we're looking to different alternatives and duckweed is one of those."" While duckweed may not necessarily conform with everyone's idea of what's appetising, it is eaten by humans in parts of the world, including south-east Asia. Dr Mortimer said it has much to recommend it — not only is it high in protein and nutrients, it grows fast and tends to take on the taste of whatever environment it has been exposed to, which can be both a blessing and a curse. ""It tends to pick up the flavour of whatever it's been growing in,"" Associate Professor Mortimer said. ""Someone else who works in the US, he's put a little bit of bacon flavouring in and it took up the bacon flavour."" But Associate Professor Mortimer said there was no way anyone should be eating it from the Torrens, which has battled pollution in recent decades. ""You can actually [eat it] as it is. I mean, not directly out of the Torrens – I don't know what else is in there,"" she said. ""One of the things we're doing in my group is collecting different Australian strains to compare how they behave and grow."" When scientists talk about making it to Mars, they tend to focus on the logistics of the journey. Elon Musk once joked that he wanted ""to die on Mars — just not on impact"". But just as big a challenge as the landing is the aftermath — and Professor Mortimer said duckweed could be part of the solution to the question of setting up a colony. ""We're also looking at a way of making other things out of it,"" she said. ""I'm really interested in … using it as a system, so a little green photosynthetic reactor for making other molecules you might need in remote environments or on a space flight, so whether that's pharmaceuticals or even perhaps some types of building material."" While she conceded its use in actual space missions might be decades away, Associate Professor Mortimer said it could help with a more rarefied culinary problem. Duckweed's capacity to absorb other flavours could again prove useful to countering menu fatigue on space missions and preventing weight loss, albeit in zero gravity. ""If astronauts lose weight, it's a huge problem because they are really sort of meant to be performing at the top of their game,"" she said. ""NASA — and this is the same in the military and all sorts of other places — they develop these highly crafted menus that are the right amount, of calories for these elite athletes who are astronauts, but people just get bored of eating the same old dehydrated microwave food. ""Sometimes you want something that's fresh or spicy or has crunch – one of the most requested up in the space station, when they're allowed to get things from home, is apples because it has that crunch and freshness.""

195,'Absolute outrage': Farming couple lead battle to win flood cash for landholders,science,"  They won their appeal for flood assistance, now these farmers vow to help other devastated producers Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Pressure is mounting on a review of the national Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) scheme with a growing number of farmers hit by flooding in Queensland and NSW deemed ineligible due to off-farm incomes. They include regenerative farmers Nick and Brydie Holliday, who were initially rejected for flood recovery assistance because they earned more money from their second jobs than they did from their fledgling farm business. On appeal, they had their application approved for $14,500 to repair roads and fences damaged in February's floods. ""I still can't believe it's happened,"" Ms Holliday said, her voice breaking as she recounted the emotional roller-coaster. ""It's so incredible and I'm so proud of Nick for fighting so hard, and for our community for getting behind us and just being there the whole time for us."" The couple established Belvedere Farm at Cedarton in the Sunshine Coast hinterland two years ago, working more than 100 hours a week to build a community-supported agriculture collective by selling farm eggs and supplying about 20 families their monthly pork and beef. But to be eligible for assistance under the joint state, territory and federal DRFA scheme, primary producers have to earn at least 50 per cent of their income from their farm, or be able to satisfy administrators that their farm business would grow to meet that criteria. ""It's an absolute outrage that they assess it based on 50 per cent of your household income,"" Ms Holliday said. ""There is is really good data out there that the vast majority of Australian farms of any size, but particularly small farms, are supported by off-farm income."" The Hollidays won their appeal after submitting more information on their plans to grow big enough to supply 80 families next year. They thanked their community supporters, who raised over $10,000 for the couple after their initial application for assistance was rejected. The Hollidays have promised to invest it all into supplying meat and eggs to several not-for-profit support centres and groups. Farmers in disaster zones in northern NSW and south-east Queensland have faced a similar battle. Gympie Mayor Glen Hartwig confirmed that many of the region's producers who had second jobs to pay their mortgages and diversify for drought resilience had their applications rejected. ""Twenty years ago, people were either in primary production or they weren't,"" he said. ""Now people will run some cattle, they'll have a citrus orchard, or some macadamias and they'll work off-farm as well. ""The rural landscape has changed dramatically [and] the grant funding criteria needs to change."" The National Recovery and Resilience Agency said the DRFA scheme was currently being reviewed. ""The definition of a primary producer has been in place since at least 2007,"" it said in a statement.

196,Rain brings tiny land crustaceans known as forest hoppers to Brisbane suburbs ,science,"  Rain brings tiny land crustaceans known as forest hoppers to Brisbane suburbs Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Lawn prawns, forest hoppers, water fleas — there are a few names for the tiny creatures you may find in your home after recent heavy rain. Wavell Heights resident Helen Bender first noticed the tiny creatures dead in her home in December and has been on a mission to find out what exactly they were. ""The best way of describing them is [like] microscopic prawns or shrimps,"" Ms Bender said. ""I've only ever found them dead inside my house. I've never seen a live one. ""When I first saw one, I thought it was a flea, but on closer inspection, it wasn't a flea."" The largest forest hopper Ms Bender found was about 5 millimetres, but others ranged in size from 1 to 2mm. ""I have spent quite a few weeks trying to hunt down what they were and, if they were a problem, what I could do about them,"" she said. That is when Queensland Museum collection manager for molluscs and crustaceans Darryl Potter offered his expertise. He said the small creatures were indeed a type of crustacean known as amphipods, but unlike crabs, crayfish, lobsters and prawns with five pairs of legs, the lawn prawns had seven pairs. Amphipods have also adapted to life on land and can grow to 7mm in length. They come out at night after periods of rain and often enter lowset homes, pets' bowls, swimming pools and other human environments. However, come morning, they dry out and die. Amphipods feed on microorganisms in the soil and contribute to the decomposition of the forest floor. They are harmless to humans and pets and are widespread across parts of Queensland and NSW, where there is plenty of rainfall and warm conditions. Mr Potter said the animals were also known as leafhoppers because they usually emerged from mulch and leaf litter or as carpet prawns because the first time many people noticed them was when they entered their homes. ""We've had an incredible amount of rain recently, so these things have started coming out because it's activated them,"" he said. ""There's not too much you can do about them. ""The particular species people find, called Talitroides topitotum, was actually introduced ages ago from Sri Lanka, and now it's found pretty broadly across the temperate and tropical parts of the world. ""We do have a whole range of native ones, but much like the problems you get with cane toads and Asian house geckos, the invaders are more successful, so they tend to be found by people after wet weather."" Ms Bender suspected the influx of tiny creatures was related to the rain and noticed them ""come in waves"" into her home. ""The funny thing is I don't even have lawn or garden beds,"" she said.

197,"Last election, Labor said it would end live sheep exports. Where does it stand now?",science," ABC Rural Labor yet to reveal agriculture policy including live sheep exports, dairy regulation, worker shortage Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The federal opposition remains tight-lipped about its plans for Australia's $81 billion agriculture industry, should it form government. With the federal election to be called within days, Shadow Agriculture Minister Julie Collins has refused to say if Labor would phase out the live export of sheep — a policy it took to the 2019 election. In an interview with the ABC, Ms Collins also would not say if Labor would pursue re-regulation of the dairy industry, installing a floor in the farmgate milk price. ""At the last election, we had a policy in relation to getting the ACCC to look at that issue,"" she said. ""We've been talking to dairy farmers, and we'll be making announcements about what we want to do in the coming weeks."" Asked if Labor had any policies that related directly to the production of livestock, cropping or horticulture, Ms Collins said: ""Clearly the issues that farmers raise with me that are most important to them, number one is always climate change because there's no doubt that climate is impacting on what's going on, on our farms"". ""They [farmers] also raise with me biosecurity, they raise with me labour shortages, they raise a whole heap of issues when I am talking to them."" But Ms Collins would not yet say how a Labor government would boost biosecurity or directly address a farm worker shortage. Ms Collins said she understood Australian farmers required 10,000 to 20,000 additional workers. Foreign workers could be allowed to live permanently in Australia if Labor wins the upcoming election, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has hinted. The Franklin MP said Labor had already announced several policies relating to agriculture, including a commitment to licensing of labour hire firms. ""There's our Powering Australia climate change policy, which will create jobs, five out of six of those 600,000 jobs in regional Australia,"" Ms Collins said. ""They'll of course benefit farmers with real action on climate change. ""We have outlined our regional housing policy, our regional telecommunications policy, our jobs and skills Australia [policy]. ""We'll have more to say during the campaign, we'll be offering a very clear alternative."" Ms Collins lives on Hobart's eastern shore and was first elected to the federal parliament in 2007. Following a stint as shadow minister for ageing, Ms Collins was appointed Shadow Agriculture Minister in January 2021. She succeeds Ed Husic and Joel Fitzgibbon as Labor's agriculture spokesperson during the current parliament. ""I'm loving being the Shadow Agriculture Minister and I would look forward to it in government, obviously that's up to the leader … I think it's a great portfolio,"" she said. Earlier this week, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese addressed the National Farmers' Federation conference. At the conference, Mr Albanese announced a Labor government would commit $500 million from its national reconstruction fund specifically to agriculture, fisheries and forestry. The $15 billion fund, intended to help Australia recover from the pandemic, would provide loans and equity for projects to boost the economy. Mr Albanese also committed $400 million to expand mobile phone coverage along roads and for regional homes and businesses, and a $20 million audit of mobile phone coverage to commence this year. The audit would use Australia Post trucks to determine where mobile signal could be improved. Asked at the conference if Labor would keep the government's new agriculture visa, Mr Albanese did not say. ""It's not real at the moment,"" he said of the visa.

198,"'Laid to rest': 42,000yo remains of Mungo Man to be reburied, but some elders say they weren't consulted",science,"  Mungo Man and Mungo Lady to be reburied in unmarked graves in landmark federal decision Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The remains of Mungo Man and 107 other Indigenous people who lived up to 42,000 years ago will be reburied in 26 unknown locations in western NSW, amid ""anger"" from some local elders they were not consulted. Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley made the announcement today at the Mungo National Park, where Mungo Man is stored after being returned to country in 2017. His remains, which were the oldest evidence of humans living in Australia until a 65,000-year-old site was discovered in the Northern Territory in 2017, were removed in 1974 without the permission of traditional owners and were taken to the National Museum of Australia. The decision to rebury them follows additional consultation initiated by Ms Ley after Heritage NSW recommended the reburial of Mungo Man, Mungo Lady and the other individuals discovered at Lake Mungo and Willandra Lakes between 1960 and 1980. ""The decision that I've made is absolutely the right one,"" Ms Ley said. ""That's what respected Indigenous traditional culture and that's what we as a nation must do."" The decision has been supported by the Aboriginal Advisory Group (AAG), which Ms Ley said consisted of ""effectively elected members from three tribal groups"". The Willandra Lakes Regional World Heritage Area AAG decided in 2018 that they wanted the reburial, and today chairwoman and Mutthi Mutthi elder Patsy Winch said the government had listened to her people. ""We have tears of joy and tears of sorrow over this decision,"" she said. ""It's been a long, hard battle to get here that we thought we were going to lose but we didn't. Now we can all move on to the next stage."" But many local Indigenous people have told the ABC they were excluded from the process. According to the National Native Title Tribunal, the majority of Lake Mungo falls within the Paakantyi people's land, and parts are recognised as Mutthi Mutthi and Ngiyampaa land. ""I am so angry, and we need it to stop,"" Paakantyi elder Jennifer Jones said. ""Mungo Man cannot be buried unless all the traditional owners make that decision."" Ms Jones said she had been writing to Ms Ley on the topic for years, but her tribe had been left out of the discussion despite being the traditional owners. ""I will continue to fight for Mungo until the day I die,"" she said. Paakantyi man Michael Young said the story of Mungo Man was deeply significant, and he wanted the remains to be somewhere ""that we could connect people through scholarships, bringing archaeologists out, scientists out and through the universities"". ""For them to just bore hole and drop remains down a hole ... there's nothing ceremonial about that. That's a sad end of Mungo."" While the Paakantyi people are the main native title holders in Mungo National Park, parts of the area are recognised as Mutthi Mutthi and Ngiyampaa land. Mutthi Mutthi man Jason Kelly grew up in nearby Balranald and is a former Willandra Lakes park ranger. He said a ""keeping place"" where people could pay their respects and honour Mungo Man in a culturally appropriate way would be in line with the wishes of many past and present Mutthi Mutthi elders. ""[Sussan Ley] had promised that when COVID lifted that she would come out and meet with us and obviously she's meeting with the AAG and nobody else,"" he said. ""My mind boggles that the Minister hasn't come to speak to us at all. I'm really shocked and disappointed."" Ms Ley said she had engaged a national consultation process and there was ""overwhelming agreement"". Heritage NSW recommended Mungo Man's reburial after receiving 162 submissions during public consultation. ""The right decision was the easiest decision,"" she said. ""No-one was ignored, everyone was listened to, everyone was heard."" Patsy Winch said four of her sisters had died in the time the process had been underway. ""I'm happy that I'm still here and that it's not going to drag on for another 40 years, that this burial is going to happen very shortly,"" she said. ""I am thankful these ancestral remains will finally be laid to rest the traditional way in country."" NSW Environment Minister James Griffin said the project had been subject to extensive community consultation and when he met with Indigenous people last month, ""they seemed quite happy with how consultation had taken place"". He acknowledged the length of time that had passed but said it had been difficult for respective governments to determine how the reburial would take place, due to the national park's listing as a UNESCO World Heritage site. ""I can't imagine the grief they've experienced in this process, especially considering some of the elders who fought for the return of these remains are no longer with us,"" he said. ""It's time to let their spirits rest in peace. ""I hope it provides some comfort for the Barkindji/Paakantji, Mutthi Mutthi and Ngiyampaa people."" The 108 remains are set to be reburied across the national park in the coming months. Ms Ley said she had added three conditions in an attempt to safeguard the remains. ""They will be monitored, they will be secure, they will be looked after, and they will still remain in the custodian group of this Aboriginal Advisory Group,"" she said. The location will be only be known by select people in the AAG.

199,Puppy-dog eyes are cute. But they might also be emotional manipulation,science," Science The science behind puppy-dog eyes, and other ways our canines communicate with us Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog You know how it hurts to hold a smile for too long? Well, that's because, like many human facial expressions, smiles rely on certain tiny facial muscles that can flex fast, but tire quickly. It now appears that dogs also have lots of these kinds of muscles in their faces too. And this could be what helps dogs communicate with humans, and why we find them so expressive and appealing, researchers say. The team, led by Anne Burrows of Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, previously found that fast-twitching muscles above the eyebrows are what enables dogs to put on their famous puppy-dog eyes. That's the slightly worried vulnerable look that dogs get that makes us want to go, ""Awww … so cuute … come and let me look after you."" ""Someone described it as a way of hijacking our emotions,"" Dr Burrows said. And it certainly works in dog shelters. ""Dogs that make that puppy-dog face get adopted more quickly than dogs that don't make that face,"" she said. In their new study, Dr Burrows and colleagues have looked further afield than the eyebrows and found there are a lot more fast-twitching muscles in dogs' faces. These muscles also create other facial expressions that get us to pay attention to dogs. ""It's all about the dog-human bond,"" said Dr Burrows, who presented her preliminary findings at a scientific meeting held in Philadelphia this week. Tony Armstrong takes us into the incredible world of our four-legged friends, revealing the fascinating evolutionary journey of dogs, their amazing super senses, and the science behind their well-being. Fast-twitching muscles around the mouth are also important for the short, sharp movements required in barking, which is another tool dogs use to communicate with humans. Dogs bark to be playful, to protect their territory, and warn us of intruders, Dr Burrows said. By contrast, wolves, which are essentially the undomesticated ancestors of dogs, tend to howl rather than bark — and it's to communicate with other wolves, not humans. Dr Burrows found wolves have relatively few fast-twitching facial muscles and more slow-twitching ones. These are more suitable for howling, which require facial muscles to contract for a long time, she said. Dogs only tend to howl in response to something like a fire engine or a musical instrument — it's definitely not the norm. There has been much speculation on when barking evolved, but it is thought to have been as a result of domestication, and may have evolved after the fast-twitching muscles that gave dogs flexibility for facial expressions. ""It was part of the domestication process somehow — whether humans chose dogs consciously that were barking, or whether it was a by-product of domestication,"" Dr Burrows said. Interestingly, she added, most of the ""ancient dog breeds"" don't bark much. While humans have more fast-twitching facial muscles than wolves — useful for quick smiles and frowns and the like — we have fewer of these muscles than dogs. Dr Burrows thinks this is because humans use speech, which requires us to hold our mouth in certain shapes for longer periods of time, to form various sounds. Bradley Smith of Central Queensland University, who studies the cognition and behaviour of canines, said the study was ""a great step"" in our understanding of how dogs can communicate with us. ""Dogs have evolved to become the most successful species in the world at communicating with humans,"" Dr Smith said. ""They manipulate us into caring for them, taking them for walks, feeding them treats and all those things."" Dogs have more forward-looking eyes than wolves, which makes it easier for them to make eye contact with humans, Dr Smith said. And the ""mutual gaze"" between dog and humans triggers the release of the love drug oxytocin in us, he added. Australian animal behaviourist Melissa Starling, an honorary affiliate with the University of Sydney, knows all too well the mutual gaze. ""Dogs' faces are full of expression and when I'm working with dogs, I'm always looking at their faces,"" Dr Starling said. ""I think it's quite likely that even without meaning to, we would selectively breed dogs for communication styles that speak to us."" Dr Starling says the position of a dog's ears or the corners of their mouth can also be important in communication, as is tension that shows on their face. In some cases, Dr Starling said, dogs try to reduce the intensity of eye contact by giving soft slow blinks to indicate they are not a threat, or showing their front teeth in a ""submissive grin"". ""It may be the kinds of facial expressions produced by these muscles causes us to engage with animals, because it's showing a mirror of ourselves,"" she said.

200,Voters return to polls by August after iVote bungle in local government elections,science,"  NSW Electoral Commission to pay for new council elections after iVote bungle Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The NSW Electoral Commission has been ordered to cover the costs of holding fresh elections in three councils where its online voting software, iVote, failed last year. The NSW Supreme Court last month scrapped the 2021 council election results in Kempsey, Singleton, and Ward A of Shellharbour Council due to the iVote malfunction — sending tens of thousands of voters back to the polls. Today the court confirmed the election of 19 councillors will officially be declared void on May 3, triggering fresh elections within three months of that date. The court ordered that the cost of the new elections be covered by the NSW Electoral Commission, which will also pay the councils' legal bill. Shellharbour Deputy Mayor Kellie Marsh was one of the councillors who will have to contest her seat a second time. She welcomed the ruling but said it did little to ameliorate the inconvenience to ratepayers and candidates. ""The Electoral Commission made an epic stuff up with the iVote system,"" Councillor Marsh said. ""The chief magistrate said it was through no fault of ours that that happened. ""But it does not compensate the community for the time that they are going to spend going back to the ballot boxes again."" Individual candidates will have the opportunity to pursue personal costs when the matter is before the courts again next month. The Electoral Commission is prepared to make an ""act of grace"" payment to cover candidates' expenditure — a discretionary mechanism used to address government operational issues. Cr Marsh said, ultimately, taxpayers would still bear the burden of the iVote failure. ""I do bear in mind that when the Electoral Commission is making payments to anybody, that is still coming out of state coffers and that does sit quite heavily on me,"" she said. Kempsey Shire Council general manager Craig Milburn said it cost council around a quarter of a million dollars to run the last election. ""The [NSW AEC] have agreed that council only have to pay for one election, not two, so they'll cover the cost of the second,"" Mr Milburn said. He welcomed the news that successful and unsuccessful candidates from the now void council election would be reimbursed the ""legitimate costs"" they incurred in running as a candidate. ""It will allow them to make a decision about whether they do or don't run again, so that's very positive,"" Mr Milburn said. Kempsey Mayor Leo Hauville said it was ""tremendous"" to have confirmation that campaign expenses including costs of advertising, events, and staff, would be reimbursed on a case-by-case basis. ""I know in the Kempsey Council elections some people didn't expend anything other than apply,"" Mr Hauville said. ""But as came out in the Supreme Court today, nearly $20,000 was spent by one individual candidate, so there's a huge range there."" Despite the court's decision, Mr Hauvillle said there was still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the financial implications of the new elections. ""Anyone could stand again so we might have a totally new council elected,"" he said. ""That will be a major cost for Kempsey Council because we've already held 11 induction days training the new councillors on the role of council and their roles … that will all have to be redone."" Also discussed in court were questions around when the new council elections would be called, with councils required to sign off on documents required by state legislation including an operating plan and delivery plan in the coming months. ""The decision on the new election date will hopefully be made after June 30, so that council will not have to become a caretaker council where they can't make decisions on major issues, namely the statutory documents which have to be approved by council,"" Mr Hauville said.

201,Need a battery to store rooftop solar? You may not need to buy one of your own,science," Science A community battery 'like a corner store': Is this the future of home energy storage? Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog When Australia's first community battery trial came to the Perth suburb of Alkimos Beach in 2016, Kelly was sceptical. ""There was a whole lot of discussion about whether it would save us money or not. The fee structure was quite complex,"" she said. Eventually, her family took a punt and signed up to the trial. ""And it did save us money. It was at least $100 every two months."" A 1.1MWh lithium ion battery located in bushland on the edge of the suburb stored energy in the daytime, when rooftop solar panels were pumping out cheap and abundant watts, and released it into the grid in the evening, when residents came home and demand peaked. Half a decade later, the Alkimos trial has finished (more on this later), others have begun elsewhere in the country, and community batteries are being promoted as a key part of the transition to clean energy. If the cooperative local storage model works as well as advocates claim, quietly humming crate-sized batteries may become a familiar site in suburbs, towns and inner-city areas within the next five years. Households should pay less for power, less for grid upgrades, and won't have to fork out thousands for a battery of their own. But there are plenty of vocal doubters, with some saying this communal approach is doomed to fail. So what are community batteries and are they better than home ones? The high uptake of rooftop solar has seen households generating remarkable amounts of cheap energy in the daytime, but created a new problem: congestion of the transmission network, or grid. Did you know your rooftop solar panels may be automatically switching off in the middle of the day? Here's what causes ""curtailment"" and how it can be avoided. To understand this, think of the electricity as water and the network of wires and substations as pipes and pumps respectively. The ""water"" generated by solar panels that households don't use has to be exported to the grid through these ""pipes"". But if there's too much ""water"" for the ""pipes"" to transport, it backs up, and can ""flood"" (ie. overload) neighbourhood substations and households themselves, which damages appliances and infrastructure. One solution is to install thicker wires and more robust substations to carry more electricity from the local network to the broader grid, but this is expensive. It's also a bit of a circuitous route: the abundant solar energy that's exported to the grid in the daytime has to be sent right back again a few hours later, in the afternoon and evening, when people come home from work and use energy-hungry appliances like ovens and heaters. Home and community batteries help solve this problem by storing the energy locally, so that less (or none at all) needs to be exported and then imported. To use the water analogy, it's like having a big neighbourhood tank, or many smaller drums, to temporarily store the water. A 1MWh battery can power up to 1,000 average homes for about two hours. Though there are different models, households generating excess solar energy are typically paid to export this power to the battery, and then pay a smaller amount to import whatever they need later. On top of this, there's usually a monthly fee to access the battery service. All up, households are meant to save. The 119 households that participated in the Alkimos trial, for instance, collectively saved over $81,000 on electricity costs over the five-year duration of the trial, or an average of about $36 per bill. The battery also successfully eased the strain on the grid: there was an 85 per cent reduction in consumption of energy from the grid at peak times for participating households. But the trial was too expensive to continue, the report concluded. The monthly fee of $11 per household was ""highly subsidised"" and ""not sustainable"", meaning that participants were getting too sweet a deal and ""the trial could not become a permanent offering"". But Synergy and Western Power, the two state utilities that ran the Alkimos trial, have since embarked on other larger community battery trials. Synergy's general manager of customer experience, Colin Smith, said Synergy was exploring different ""distributed energy resources"" technologies including both home and community batteries. For households, he said, ""suburb-based batteries"" are a ""battery storage solution without the upfront costs."" Home batteries have proved relatively popular, with more than 30,000 sold in 2021, despite costing a hefty $10,000 for a standard-size system. These small batteries are good for local energy storage, but a shared approach is more efficient, says Dylan McConnell, an energy systems expert from the University of Melbourne. ""The overall shape of the aggregate load and generation is better managed at [the neighbourhood] level than at the individual level,"" he said. Individual households' energy generation and consumption partly cancel each other out at the suburb-wide aggregate level, which reduces the demand on the shared battery, he says. ""The sum of the peaks is greater than the peak of the sums. ""Individual houses have a peaky load (ie. demand goes up and down), but at the suburb level, that demand is smoothed out."" Rather than many houses installing private batteries, the same number can use a shared battery at different times. And the shared battery doesn't have to be as large as the combined capacity of all those household batteries, says Marnie Shaw from Australian National University's Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program. ""It's hard to give exact figures, but essentially you need less battery per house if you're sharing, compared to individual household batteries."" ""How much less depends on a number of things, so it's hard to say exactly, but it's in the order of 10-50 per cent."" Western Australia has run the first community battery trials, thanks partly to not being part of the National Electricity Market (NEM), which means there are different regulatory hurdles: Western Power and Synergy kicked off a third trial for 600 homes early last year. But the NEM is rapidly catching up: Ausgrid installed the ""first of many"" batteries in Sydney last year, as part of a two-year trial. In Melbourne, United Energy has been rigging up a network of 40 small 30kW community batteries on power poles, to support 3,000 homes, following a trial in 2020. And in May, Yarra Energy Foundation (YEF) will install a 250kWh battery in North Fitzroy. This, too, will be the first of many batteries for inner-Melbourne, says Chris Wallin, YEF's commercial program manager. ""We have a goal of 200 community batteries within seven years,"" he said. ""I'd say before 2030 there should be thousands of them."" Community batteries, Mr Wallin envisions, will be a small, trusted, local service, ""like a corner store"". ""The second generation of batteries will include EV charging. ""Your EV will be connected to a charging point which will be connected to the community battery."" These mid-scale community batteries will exist alongside larger ""grid-scale"" batteries and smaller home ones, Mr Wallin says. ""We're not saying don't have home batteries. ""We need storage wherever we can put it — all the way from home batteries, community batteries, grid batteries and pumped hydro storage."" Experts agree that Australia has to dramatically increase energy storage capacity in order to grow the share of renewables in the grid, decarbonise electricity generation, and have any chance of meeting our Paris Agreement emissions reductions targets. YEF's plan for 200 community batteries barely scratches the surface. The North Fitzroy battery, for instance, will service just one of the 5,000 ""substation areas"" that make up the CitiPower distribution network across Melbourne's CBD and inner suburbs. That is, 200 batteries will cover a fraction of the CitiPower network, which itself is the smallest network in Victoria. ""Two hundred batteries is a drop in the ocean,"" Mr Wallin said. Of course, there is a way to pool the resources of home batteries, to create a kind of distributed community battery. Called a Virtual Power Plant (VPPs), it's a network of hundreds or even thousands of connected household batteries coordinated to work as one large virtual battery. Whether community batteries or VPPs are the future will come down to a single question, says Hedda Ransan-Cooper, a social scientist with ANU's Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program. ""The question of trust is a really big one."" VPPs and other grid-integration schemes (such as vehicle-to-the-grid, or V2G, where EVs take the role of household battery) will only work with the participation of households that own what network operators call ""distributed energy resources"" — that is, the solar panels and home batteries themselves. And to be willing to participate, they need to trust the grid-integration scheme is good for them, and not just for the company signing them up. ""The industry simply does not understand that trust is going to be the biggest issue."" Battery manufacturers across Australia are pushing into the production of mid-sized batteries for remote towns, schools, and even greenfield housing developments. But Dr Ransan-Cooper has found ""literally no empirical evidence"" to support the idea that households want to participate, with many households saying this is because they fear the energy companies will try to rip them off. ""The energy sector is one of the least trusted,"" she said. The general sentiment from interviews with households around the country, she said, was ""don't mess with my kit"". ""People don't like the idea of you coming in and fiddling with what's in their home."" Most VPP trials, she says, are heavily subsidised and made up of a demographic who are highly engaged and tend to be more willing to take the risk. ""That is a very small proportion of people."" Community batteries sidestep some of these trust issues, as there's no messing with kit, Dr Ransan-Cooper says. They can also be operated by more trusted local organisations. ""Local government keeps popping up in the research that we do,"" she said. ""Its not universally loved, but the idea is it's more accountable than market bodies and energy generators, who are so distant."" The Yarra City Council, for instance, established the Yarra Electricity Foundation (YEF), which is now setting up the North Fitzroy battery trial and exploring the idea of residents becoming shared owners of their local battery. Community batteries can also be used by all, not only those who can afford to buy a house and install solar panels and batteries. ""I'm a big fan of neighbourhood batteries,"" Dr Ransan-Cooper said. ""My personal view is [they] present a serious and much better alternative compared to household batteries."" Tristan Edis, an analyst with Green Energy Markets, disagrees. ""It's a load of bullshit. People want to blow a bunch of money on this because they like the idea of socialism."" Having shared community batteries rather than batteries in everyone's homes may be a more efficient model of energy storage, he says, but it will never be done at a great enough scale. ""They are tiny tokenistic drops in the ocean."" Household batteries, he says, are what households want: the government should copy policy that has seen a world-record per-capita uptake of solar panels in Australia, and introduce battery rebates. He's calculated that this would deliver 10,000MW of storage by 2030. Australia's solar boom was driven by generous subsidies. Should batteries be next? So far, however, there's no sign of a nationwide battery rebate on the horizon. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency, meanwhile, continues to fund community battery trials (as well as VPP trials) — and Labor has promised to install hundreds of community batteries around the country if it wins the election. The Victorian government has awarded millions in grants (including to the YEF) to ""jump-start the rollout of neighbourhood-scale batteries"" and the WA government, through Synergy and Western Power, is funding the PowerBank community battery trial across 12 metropolitan and regional locations. Back in Alkimos Beach, the community battery has been taken away and Kelly is back on a standard power plan, which means she's wasting daytime solar energy and paying more for power than she had been. She'd ""definitely"" sign up to another battery trial if one was offered. But since one isn't, she's considering the alternatives. ""The trial does make me want to almost install a household battery,"" she said. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

202,The IPCC has laid out what we need to do to keep global warming under 1.5C. Here are the key takeaways,science," Science 'Transformational change' needed in all regions and sectors now to mitigate climate change: IPCC Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog It will take ""transformational change"" in every sector in every region of the world to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world's climate scientists and governments warn. The good news is the tools we need are tried and tested and already available to us — but they must be implemented now. This finding comes from the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on climate change mitigation. ""We are at a crossroads,"" IPCC chair Hoesung Lee said. ""The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future. We have the tools and know-how required to limit warming."" Existing greenhouse gas reduction strategies can and do work, the report said, and many changes will need to be made in the energy sector by, for instance, replacing fossil-fuel-combustion technologies with alternatives that run on renewables. The report also highlighted huge inequalities in carbon emissions — in essence, richer people emit far more carbon than poorer people. Changing our meat-hungry, jet-setting, fossil-fuel-guzzling ways could help halve emissions by the end of the decade, the report found. Tommy Wiedmann, professor of sustainability research at UNSW and a lead author of the ""Emissions trends and drivers"" chapter of the report, says ""transformational change … practically in every sector and in every region"" is needed if the world is to meet the aims of the Paris agreement. ""Incremental change is just not sufficient."" Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University, and a lead author of the ""National and sub-national policies and institutions"" chapter, says the need for action now ""is more urgent than it was last time the IPCC provided an assessment report in 2014"". ""But the opportunity to reduce emissions at affordable costs is also greater than previously assessed,"" Professor Jotzo said. This report comes from the IPCC's third working group, and follows the first working group's report on the drivers of climate change, published in August last year, and the second working group's report on climate change effects, published in February this year. To stay under 1.5 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the report said, greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025. Some of Australia's iconic and unique natural ecosystems are headed for irreversible damage if we keep emitting carbon at current rates, climate experts warn. But they're not necessarily the ones you might expect. ""1.5 [degrees of warming] is assessed as out of reach, unless there were immediate and deep emissions reductions in all sectors of all regions of the world, which does not appear a likely outcome,"" Professor Jotzo said. Indeed, according to UN secretary-general António Guterres, the world must cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent this decade if we are to have a chance of staying at 1.5 degrees. ""But high-emitting governments and corporations are not just turning a blind eye; they are adding fuel to the flames,"" Mr Guterres said. ""They are choking our planet, based on their vested interests and historic investments in fossil fuels, when cheaper, renewable solutions provide green jobs, energy security, and greater price stability."" So let's take a look at a few of the report's main findings, and what they mean for Australia's emissions reduction targets. The past decade saw the highest increase in greenhouse gases in human history, peaking at more than 59 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted in 2019. Emissions dropped by about 6 per cent in 2020, driven down by the pandemic, but last year bounced back to near-2019 levels. See how a town can adapt to severe storms and bushfires in this award-winning ABC augmented reality experience. The report states a few specific greenhouse-gas-intensive activities grew particularly fast between 2010 and 2020, Professor Wiedmann says. ""Sales of SUVs, sports utility vehicles, went up 17 per cent. Aviation [went up] 29 per cent. ""Energy demand for cooling in residential buildings went up 40 per cent."" The report also emphasises the extreme inequality in who produces greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, the richest 10 per cent of households contribute about 40 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, while the bottom half contribute less than 15 per cent, Professor Wiedmann says. Half of all emissions from aviation are caused by the top 1 per cent alone. But there is good to go with the bad. The report found 36 countries have successfully cut greenhouse gas emissions over the past decade, Professor Wiedmann said. ""So this is a good development — not sufficient, but good."" The cost of renewable energy technology also dropped over the past decade, with solar, wind and batteries now 87 per cent, 55 per cent and 85 per cent cheaper than in 2010. And the uptake of renewables more than exceeded previous expectations, Professor Wiedmann added, even over the past few months. ""Late last year, we wrote that solar and wind energy provided 7 per cent of total electricity supply globally."" That turned out to be an underestimate, with UK think tank Ember last week reporting that in 2021, 10 per cent of the world's electricity production came from solar and wind. More renewables, along with, for instance, energy efficiency improvements are ""good news and encouraging news"", Professor Wiedmann said. ""But still, the change is not coming fast enough. ""The report also confirms that all the gains we made in energy efficiency in the last decade have been more than outpaced by economic growth and population growth."" The report found emissions from existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure — called committed emissions or committed carbon — would, on their own, well and truly shoot us past 1.5 degrees of warming. In modelled scenarios that kept warming under 2 degrees, the report found the world must drastically, by 2050, roll back its use of fossil fuels and reduce: compared to 2019 usage. Australia must leave almost all its coal in the ground, as well as a good chunk of its oil and gas, if the world is to have one-in-two odds of keeping global warming to 1.5C. Limiting warming doesn't only involve limiting fossil fuels — it will require the world to get to net zero by the early 2070s, says Annette Cowie, a senior principal research scientist in climate policy at the NSW Department of Primary Industries and a lead author of the ""Cross-sectoral perspectives"" chapter of the report. ""In order to reduce our emissions and then meet net zero, we're also going to need to deploy carbon dioxide removal strategies."" The IPCC working group assessed a dozen techniques that sequester carbon from the air, most of which were biological processes that relied on photosynthesis to store carbon in plants and soil. Less effective options include ""enhanced weathering"", where crushed basalt rocks, strewn across a landscape, react with carbon dioxide in the air; and ocean fertilisation, where iron is dumped into seawater to encourage the rapid growth of photosynthetic algae. Giant machines that suck carbon dioxide from the air are being turned on around the world. So is this part of the solution to climate change? Huge machines that scrub carbon dioxide from the air in a process called ""direct air capture"" also currently fall on the ""less feasible"" end of the spectrum, despite already operating in Iceland. ""The challenge is that it takes a lot of energy, and so in order to be beneficial for climate change mitigation, it will need a lot of solar panels,"" Dr Cowie said. And direct air capture must be massively scaled up if it's to be useful. A University of Melbourne report found that even if the world reaches net zero by 2050, it will still be necessary to remove 5 to 14 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year from the atmosphere from 2030 onwards to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. The plant in Iceland, which is the world's biggest, can capture and remove 4,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide from air each year. Decisions about which methods of carbon removal to use will also need to consider their impact on, for instance, land use, Dr Cowie added. ""So we're going to need good governance as we introduce carbon dioxide removal strategies."" In October, the Australian government promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050, with a focus on ""net zero, not absolute zero emissions"". And while the latest IPCC report doesn't provide country- or region-specific assessments of mitigation policies, Professor Jotzo says, there are implications for big, sunny, windy Australia. ""Australia has plenty of opportunities right across the spectrum — renewable energy, decarbonising industry, carbon uptake on the land, you name it. ""And that includes, of course, the potential for Australia to be an exporter of zero-carbon commodities and thereby help decarbonisation in other countries."" At the moment though, climate policy in Australia is a bit of a patchwork, with no real harmonisation between federal and state policies. ""The IPCC report is very clear that the way to achieve this [climate mitigation] is through a comprehensive set of policies — not just individual policy action here and there and hoping that there will be market-driven action, but a comprehensive set of policies that complement each other,"" Professor Jotzo said. So climate policy needs to be treated more like monetary policy, he added. ""All political parties agree that Australia needs sound monetary policy in order to underpin economic growth and to avoid inflation and unemployment. ""We need the same broad-based consensus on climate policies. ""In terms of the world's authoritative stocktake of where we're heading and what we can do, [the report] very clearly shows that the opportunities are right in front of us, and that it is affordable to stay below 2 degrees.""

203,Elon Musk bought stock in Twitter two weeks before asking if a new platform was needed,science,"  Tesla boss Elon Musk buys stake in Twitter before openly criticising the social media website Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Tesla CEO Elon Musk has acquired a 9 per cent stake in Twitter, to become its largest shareholder at a time when he is questioning the social media platform's dedication to free speech and the First Amendment. Mr Musk purchased 73,486,938 shares on March 14, a filing revealed on Monday. Twitter's stock surged nearly 30 per cent on Monday. Since March 14, the date listed on the filing by Twitter, its shares were up nearly 50 per cent, meaning that Musk's investment has paid handsomely, so far. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. With more than 80 million Twitter followers, Mr Musk is an active user of the platform. However, on March 25, he tweeted that he was giving ""serious thought'"" to creating a new platform, asking his followers if they thought Twitter encouraged free speech. ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" he wrote. He then asked in another tweet on March 27: ""Is a new platform needed?"" Mr Musk has previously been at loggerheads with regulators about his use of Twitter. Industry analysts and legal experts say Musk could begin advocating for changes at Twitter immediately if he chooses. In a note to investors, analyst for research company CFRA Angelo Zino wrote that Twitter could be viewed as an acquisition target because the value of its shares have been falling since early last year. Jack Dorsey stepped down as Twitter's chief executive in November. Mr Musk's stake in Twitter is now more than four times the size of Mr Dorsey's, who co-founded the San Francisco company and had been its largest individual shareholder. ""Musk's actual investment is a very small percentage of his wealth, and an all-out buyout should not be ruled out,"" wrote Mr Zino, who covers Twitter and social media. Mr Musk could see Twitter as an investment with big growth ahead, or he could have non-investment reasons for the purchase, such as buying to make sure the platform doesn't restrain his speech, said Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan. ""What he could be worried about is if enough of his tweets start to look like disinformation, that Twitter says, 'We're doing our job against disinformation','"" Professor Gordon said. No chief executive would refuse to take a call from the company's top shareholder, so the purchase gives Mr Musk access to Twitter's top management, he said. Mr Musk has not spoken specifically about how he would change rules at Twitter, but the social media platform's history of suspensions and bans is well documented. Former President Donald Trump was banned from Twitter and other top social media platforms after the January 6 Capitol riot last year that critics accused Mr Trump of inciting. The storming of the US Capitol by an angry mob and subsequent dismantling of President Trump's social media machine represents a ""tipping point"" for the regulation of online platforms, experts say. The ban has raised difficult questions about free speech in a social media industry dominated by a few tech giants, an issue that Mr Trump and conservative media have seized upon. There was broad praise for Mr Musk from those circles Monday. Last month, Mr Musk asked a US judge to nullify a subpoena from securities regulators and discard a 2018 court agreement in which he had to have pre-approval of his Twitter posts. His lawyer has contended in court motions that the SEC is infringing on the Tesla CEO's First Amendment rights. In October of 2018, Musk and Tesla agreed to pay US$40 million ($53 million) in civil fines and for Musk to have his tweets approved by a corporate lawyer after he tweeted about having the money to take Tesla private at US$420 per share. The funding was far from secured and the electric vehicle company remains public, but Tesla's stock price jumped. The settlement came after the SEC brought a securities fraud charge. It specified governance changes, including Musk's ouster as board chairman, as well as pre-approval of his tweets. Mr Musk's revelation about his stake in Twitter shares comes two days after Tesla posted lacklustre first-quarter production numbers. While the company delivered 310,000 vehicles in the period, the figure was slightly below expectations.

204,Stockton residents want solutions as waves whipped up by east coast lows erode their beach,science,"  Stockton residents want solutions as yet another east coast low whips up waves to erode their beach Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog Giant waves have crashed onto Stockton Beach in Newcastle for the second time in weeks, breaching already eroded sand dunes and leaving locals worried about what the winter months will bring. Stockton Beach in Newcastle has suffered further erosion and damage after huge waves landed on Saturday Residents believe the year's erosion, which follows damage already inflicted during March, was the worse they had seen The traditional season for east coast lows is during May and June, leaving residents worried about what is to come Driven by a low pressure system, the latest event on Saturday saw waves up to six metres high push water through a popular council caravan park and send sand into the streets. It followed a different east coast low during March that claimed trees and shrubs from the front of the park and stripped sections of Mitchell Street. ""It's absolutely the worst anyone has seen it,"" local Ron Boyd said. ""We've lost pretty much the front of the caravan park, we've lost about a third of Dalby Oval, and water is running across the street down into the suburb in front of people's houses and we haven't seen anything like that."" He said the suburb — nestled on the northern side of the city's industrial harbour — was disappearing before his eyes as waves and tides stripped the beach and slowly swallowed the land. Mr Boyd was also a coastal geologist and said the typical east coast low season was yet to begin. ""May and June, that's when we typically see east coast lows,"" he said. Hannah Power, Associate Professor of Coastal and Marine Science at the University of Newcastle, believed the city could expect more extreme east coast lows, even if modelling did not necessarily show there would be more of them. She said the deep lows were being formed by warm water sitting off the coast, which fuelled the atmosphere. ""We've not just had one single event, we've had multiple events happen in close succession, and so the beaches haven't had time to recover in that intervening period,"" Ms Power said. She said Stockton's problem was that the sand no longer self-replenished. Numerous studies have shown that the northern breakwall to Newcastle Harbour was acting as a barrier to sand replenishment. ""In places like Stockton, we know there's a net long-term trend of sand loss, and so this current event is exacerbating that process,"" Ms Power said. ""At Stockton it's going to be challenging — sand won't naturally return on the whole how it was 10 or 20 years ago."" The Stockton Beach Taskforce was established by the NSW government in 2020 to find a long term solution to the suburb's erosion. It was investigating several ideas to fix Stockton's woes, including dredging an offshore sand deposit and dropping it just off Stockton Beach. In the meantime, Mr Boyd and the Stockton community were keeping a nervous eye on the winter months ahead. He said the erosion crisis was at a critical stage and action, rather than talk, was needed now. ""There's a huge sense of frustration,"" Mr Boyd said. ""You only have to look at the social media pages around Stockton to realise the frustration and the apathy with the fact that, 'Oh yeah, another storm, nothing's going to happen'.""

205,Electric ants discovered at doorstep of Daintree Rainforest World Heritage area,science,"  Electric ants discovered at doorstep of Daintree Rainforest World Heritage area Keep up with the reaction to Labor's election victory and the continuing vote count with our live blog The discovery of one of the world's most invasive ant species on the doorstep to the Daintree Rainforest could spell disaster for the World Heritage-listed site and its endemic plants and animals. Electric ants, native to Central and South America, were first discovered in Cairns in 2006. James Cook University invasive ant researcher Lori Lach said they ranked third-worst in the world in terms of environmental impact and first in terms of socio-economic impact. ""[That ranking] is splitting hairs between red imported fire ants, yellow crazy ants and electric ants — they're all really damaging to the environment,"" she said. ""What puts electric ants ahead on the socio-economic impact is what we see across the Pacific, where people have had to abandon their houses."" Dr Lach said what electric ants lacked in size — they only grow to about 1.5 millimetres in length — they made up for with their painful sting. ""We see reports of animals as large as elephants being blinded by electric ants if they're in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" she said. The Daintree Rainforest is home to several vulnerable animal species, including the southern cassowary, Bennet's and Lumholtz tree kangaroos and the spotted-tailed quoll. Prior to March 2022 electric ants had not been found north of the Daintree River, the demarcation line between the rainforest and sprawling populations to its south. The species was detected at the Cow Bay Waste Transfer Facility, hundreds of metres from the World Heritage area boundary. The discovery has prompted the Douglas Shire Council to temporarily restrict what residents can dump at the site. The dump is no longer accepting large household items stored at ground level, like barbecues and white goods, but is still taking green and household waste. ""We don't want to spread this, so we are trying to minimise it,"" Douglas Shire Mayor Michael Kerr said. ""We have to be conscious of the area we are in — we don't want people just to be dumping their waste willy-nilly anywhere, so we have to offer a service. ""The biggest concern for us is that if things are sitting on the ground, that's where the ants can get into it — they can start nesting and then, when we remove those items from the transfer station to take them somewhere else, we're going to spreading them to other areas."" Biosecurity Queensland's Gary Morton, the principal project officer for the National Electric Ant Eradication Program (NEAEP), said officers had discovered the suspected original infestation on a residential property north of the Daintree River. They believe ants from that site spread to the dump at Cow Bay. ""The good thing for us with electric ants is that they don't fly and they don't move very far on their own,"" Mr Morton said. ""Experiments that we've done, and also in worldwide literature, show that they move anywhere from zero to 25 metres in a year on their own, so they're not big spreaders. ""The main way they get moved is through human-assisted movement, and that is through carriers such as pot plants and plant materials."" The NEAEP will soon ask Daintree residents to book their properties in for free checks to determine whether the ants have spread beyond the dump. ""For the untouched rainforest, we're confident that they're not in there, because they would need to be moved in there by us,"" Mr Morton said. ""For what is essentially the edge of the rainforest, it's about talking to the public and getting them involved."" Dr Lach said the ants could cause havoc if they had a chance to establish themselves in the rainforest. ""Evidence we see from other areas around the world is that when electric ants get into forests they really change the composition of the arthropods and other insects in the forest,"" she said. ""The ecosystem isn't used to ants like that so it hasn't evolved any kinds of defences against it. ""That actually starts to affect the functioning of the rainforest, so we see decreased nutrient cycling and that can, over time, cascade to the point we see changes in other parts of the forest — trees, birds, butterflies and so on."" Mr Morton said the NEAEP had experience eradicating electric ants from similarly dense rainforest areas in Far North Queensland. ""We're confident that if we do find them in the forest that we'll be able to eradicate them from there,"" he said.
