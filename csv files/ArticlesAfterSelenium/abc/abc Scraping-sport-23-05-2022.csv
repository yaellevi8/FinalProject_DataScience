0,Osaka weighing up whether to go to Wimbledon after first-round French Open exit,sport," Sport Naomi Osaka may sit out Wimbledon after losing in French Open first round to Amanda Anisimova Four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka may not travel to Wimbledon after the decision by the sport's authorities to strip the tournament of ranking points. Osaka's comments came after she was knocked out of the French Open in the first round by 27th seed Amanda Anisimova 7-5, 6-4. Wimbledon last week had its ranking points taken away by the men's ATP and women's WTA after the grasscourt major opted to exclude players from Russia and Belarus because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""I would say the decision is kind of affecting, like, my mentality going into grass. I'm not 100 per cent sure if I'm going to go there,"" four-time major winner Osaka said at a press conference. ""I would love to go just to get some experience on the grass court, but at the same time, for me, it's kind of, I don't want to say pointless, no pun intended, but I'm the type of player that gets motivated by … seeing my ranking go up."" Osaka has been vocal about prioritising her mental health on the gruelling international tennis tour. This year marked her return to Roland Garros after she boycotted press conferences at the 2021 tournament, citing their effect on her mental health. She was fined and ultimately withdrew from the tournament after facing backlash for her decision. The removal of ranking points from Wimbledon was met with ""deep disappointment"" by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), which repeated its stance that the ban was the only viable option under British government guidance. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) also said it would not grant ranking points to Wimbledon this year for junior and wheelchair tennis events. The AELTC decision to impose the suspension on Russian and Belarusian players at this year's championships is the first time players have been excluded on grounds of nationality since the immediate post-World War II era, when German and Japanese players were banned.

1,Rising Warriors star to step away from rugby league at age 23 ,sport," Sport Warrior star Chanel Harris-Tavita to take hiatus from rugby league at age 23 Warriors playmaker Chanel Harris-Tavita never expected to make this decision but at the age of 23, he has chosen to take a hiatus from the NRL. ""I want to take a break from rugby league,"" he said. ""I've made the decision in the last couple of weeks. ""Over the last year, I haven't been enjoying it as much as I want to, even though being an NRL player was something I dreamed of as a kid."" He will leave the Warriors at the end of the 2022 NRL season and says his decision is not related to mental health. Arguably the most talented New Zealand playmaker to come through the Warriors since Shaun Johnson's arrival at NRL level in 2011, Harris-Tavita has it all. A nice step, a rock-solid defensive game and a left boot equal parts power and precision. But just 44 games into his NRL career, the playmaker has decided to put that on hold. ""I have felt guilty when I think about the decision I'm making,"" he said. ""There are plenty of kids out there that would love to be in my position. Stepping back from the game might look like I'm taking it all for granted. ""I just think it's the best decision for me. Each time I told a family member or friend, it was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. ""I was scared to say it out loud, let alone tell my family, friends, and teammates. Most of the people I told were shocked, but they were all very supportive, which I'm thankful for. ""I'm extremely grateful for the experiences I've had and the people I've worked with. ""Soon it'll be time for a change of scenery."" Harris-Tavita intends to use 2023 to travel and continue his newfound hobby of writing. He is still keen to represent Samoa or New Zealand at the Rugby League World Cup later this year. The playmaker says the pressure of coming off-contract this year was the catalyst for him to finally make his decision. The Warriors offered Harris-Tavita a new deal in the pre-season but he knocked them back and said he wanted to hold off, eager to prove his worth after two injury-affected years. But the delay was partly because he knew he was living a lie. ""I was trying to delay the contract decision,"" he said. ""Deep down, I knew I didn't want to sign another contract and I was trying to hide that feeling from everyone including myself. ""A couple of weeks ago, my manager was coming to Brisbane to negotiate my contract and I said to myself: 'Am I going to grow some balls and make this decision now or am I just going to keep everyone else happy?' ""Before that, I was practically lying to everyone about what I wanted to do."" After being part of the Warriors side which has been forced to live in Terrigal, Tamworth, the Gold Coast and now Brisbane over the last three years, Harris-Tavita hopes to finish this chapter of his NRL journey back in Auckland. ""It's been a long time coming,"" he added. ""Hopefully we can play some good footy and get a good turnout. ""Knowing there's an end in sight, I'm sure I'll appreciate each moment a little bit more.""

2,Justin Thomas wins PGA Championship in thrilling playoff finish after Mito Pereira's heartbreaking implosion,sport," Sport Justin Thomas wins PGA Championship in thrilling playoff finish against Will Zalatoris after Mito Pereira's heartbreaking implosion Justin Thomas has won the PGA Championship for the second time, beating fellow American Will Zalatoris in a play-off. Thomas began the final day seven shots back, before launching a spectacular comeback — with three birdies on the back nine — to secure a place in the three-hole play-off. Both players birdied the 13th hole, before Thomas drove the short par-4 17th for another birdie ahead of Zalatoris' par. The Kentucky native then parred the 18th to clinch a one-shot win. Chilean golfer Mito Pereira had led for most of the final round, before hitting his tee shot in the water on the 18th to finish tied for third. Thomas, who first won the PGA Championship in 2017, impressed in difficult conditions over the first two days at Southern Hills Country Club but a poor Saturday performance left him with a lot of work to do. After a slow start to his final round, Thomas gathered momentum to start putting pressure on the leaders throughout his back nine. But even so, Pereira seemed to have the field at arm's length for the most part as Zalatoris, Cam Young and Matt Fitzpatrick failed to make ground on the Chilean. With a one-shot lead going into the 18th hole, a horrible tee shot from Pereira led to a double-bogey six which took him from the outright lead to a shot behind the playoff pair. Zalatoris had to make a clutch par putt on the 18th green in regulation to make the playoff, and faced off with Thomas in the three-hole shootout. But Thomas kept his nerve to edge Zalatoris by a single shot and secure the Wanamaker Trophy again. See how the action unfolded in our live blog. By Dean Bilton Justin Thomas beat Will Zalatoris by one shot in a three-hole playoff. By Dean Bilton I've got to be honest, I thought this final round was fizzling away a couple of hours ago when none of the contenders looked interested in putting the hands out and really grabbing this tournament. It took a final-hole implosion from Mito Pereira and some seriously impressive golf from Justin Thomas to make this a memorable major, and I think we certainly have a deserving champion. Thanks for joining me this morning, look forward to seeing you at the US Open for 2022's third major. By Dean Bilton He had to come from a long way back today, but Justin Thomas was probably the stand-out performer over the first two days of this tournament. He was part of an unlucky group of players who were stuck playing in the worst weather conditions on each of those first two rounds, but managed to remain in contention despite that. Thomas has been playing stellar golf all year without being able to close. A few opponents may have had to fall away to make today's comeback a reality, but he's deserved a bit of luck. When it got to the playoff, he played just about flawless golf. He's already had the phone call from his mate Tiger Woods, and Justin Thomas channelled a little bit of the Cat in the closing stages of this tournament. By Dean Bilton From seven shots back at the start of the day to champion in a playoff, what a day for Justin Thomas. In a leaderboard packed with rookies and players yet to taste victory at the highest level, it taught one of the best players in the world to show them how to handle the moment and step up to the occasion. Justin Thomas is now a two-time major winner, and as the tears roll down his face you can see what it means to him. By Dean Bilton He has two putts to win the PGA Championship for the second time. This one is down hill, so expect him to nurse it down there pretty gently. Got to be careful not to whack this one. It's a thing of beauty from Justin Thomas! He rolls it just past the hole and will tap in for the title... By Dean Bilton The ball is nestling along the fringe. He'll have to whack this up the hill and let it break sharply right to left. Don't know what the data guys would say, but I give him about a 1% chance from here. It's a good putt, but not good enough. He has a pretty comfy one left for par. By Dean Bilton A good shot here could just about seal it. He has nine iron, and adrenaline bursting through him. And Justin Thomas has found the green! That's all he had to do, stay away from the bunkers and give yourself two putts to win. In all likelihood, Zalatoris will have to make an incredibly difficult birdie putt or Justin Thomas will be our champion. By Dean Bilton A reminder, Justin Thomas currently has a one-shot lead in the playoff. This is the last of three holes. Zalatoris needs to make something happen right here, right now. Zalatoris has 182 yards to the hole. Needs to hit a cut. Tell you what, that is not bad.... but it's trickling away from the hole along the edge of the green. Still, he'll have a birdie putt no matter how difficult it may be. That was a low, cutty little swing that very nearly came off brilliantly. By Dean Bilton Just has to hit the fairway, give yourself a chance. He does that, but he's a long way back from JT's drive. He has a chance, but he'll need to hit the iron shot of his life coming in. By Dean Bilton He hit an absolute beauty in regulation, a low stinging cut. What's he got this time? It's even better! That was a VERY provocative line, and for a second he might have worried about a bad kick into the creek to the right of the fairway. But it scooted straight and is in the perfect position. By Dean Bilton I don't need to tell you what can happen on this hole, but I will anyway. About 30 minutes ago, Mito Pereira had a one-stroke leading going into this final hole. He sliced his tee shot into the creek, made a double-bogey six and finished a shot out of the playoff. Justin Thomas leads by one, but nothing is safe on this the toughest hole at Southern Hills Country Club. By Dean Bilton By Dean Bilton For birdie and the lead with one playoff hole to play. NEVER. IN. DOUBT. Justin Thomas is a hole away from his second PGA Championship. He leads the playoff by a stroke. By Dean Bilton Such an important putt. Eight feet for birdie. And he's pushed it. Zalatoris chases after it quickly and taps in his par, but that could be very costly indeed. By Dean Bilton I might have been a bit generous with the 20 feet estimation, it's more like 35. It's not an easy putt, but major champions have a knack of making these. Didn't give it enough. A little nervous about sending that past the hole and down the hill I think. He's marking his ball and letting Zalatoris putt next, but he should be safely in for birdie from there. By Dean Bilton A real tester for the short game here, needs to fly it over the bunker but get it to stop quickly after the hole. And that is exactly what he does! A very classy chip that will leave him about eight feet for birdie. Great comeback. By Dean Bilton Right, how do you answer that? Uh oh. It's avoided the creek, which I didn't think it would for a moment, but that one has missed miles to the right. He'll have a very delicate little chip over the bunker to come. Advantage JT. By Dean Bilton What has he got? OH IT'S STUNNING! Justin Thomas finds the back of the green with a spectacular tee shot! He'll have 20 feet for his eagle! By Dean Bilton A fantastic hole these last two days since they brought the tee box up. This is a par-four the players have to try to get to in one. Length isn't a problem, but you have to hit such a precise fade to find the green and avoid the nasty bunkers and creeks near the green. This will be fun to watch.

3,'These are player safety issues': NRL rebuke Bunnies concussion claim ,sport," Sport 'These are player safety issues': NRL defends handling of head injuries after Rabbitohs concussion criticism The NRL have rebuked claims Taane Milne was incorrectly ruled out of South Sydney's loss to Canberra after a head knock, telling coaches they are not qualified to question the league's independent doctors. Milne was deemed to have copped a category-one head knock in the Rabbitohs' loss to Canberra, and immediately ruled out of the match after showing concussion symptoms on-field. Afterwards, Souths coach Jason Demetriou claimed he would be speaking to the NRL over the incident, adamant that there had been nothing wrong with the winger. But at his weekly media briefing on Monday, Graham Annesley showed replays of Milne's head hitting the ground before he stumbled back to the Souths' line. The NRL's head of football also revealed Milne had failed his off-field HIA, meaning he would not have been allowed back on the field even if he was considered a category two. ""These are player safety issues. These are not issues to be dismissed by players, coaches or anyone else,"" Annesley said. ""For non-medically qualified people to say he was OK or that he could have come back on the field (is wrong). ""To be brutally honest, we can't be led by opinions of non-medically trained people or by the player himself. It's a medical diagnosis that takes place."" Annesley said he had not heard from Demetriou on Monday over the situation, with the Rabbitohs also losing Tevita Tatola to a head knock. The incident comes after coaches raised several issues over players being deemed category ones in the early stages of the season, immediately ruling them out of games. And while Annesley admitted they had potentially been too cautious in the early rounds upon the implementation of the independent doctor, he was adamant this was not the case with Milne. Cronulla bounces back from last week's loss to Canberra to defeat Gold Coast 25-18, while the Raiders celebrate their third win in a row after beating South Sydney 32-12 in Dubbo. ""We would be the first to admit that maybe in the opening two rounds while we settled the system down, maybe some calls made that were too safe,"" Annesley said. ""Maybe they went too far. But that's not the case on this incident. ""This is not a decision that has to be debated. ""It's a decision made by an independent medical practitioner who has observed signs that indicate a possible concussion. ""That decision is taken not in the best interest of the NRL… but in the best interest of the player."" Meanwhile Annesley again defended several key calls over the weekend, including Dane Gagai's no-try in Newcastle's loss to Brisbane and the Christian Tuipulotu high hit in Manly's defeat to Parramatta. He also remains adamant the decision to not call an obstruction before Selwyn Cobbo's try against the Knights was not a howler, and was open to interpretation as a 50-50 call.

5,Top women's seeds suffer shock losses as French Open kicks off,sport,"  Top women's seeds Ons Jabeur, Garbine Muguruza tumble in day one upsets at Roland Garros A pair of major upsets early on day one of the French Open have blown the bottom half of the women's draw wide open at Roland Garros as Madrid champion Ons Jabeur and 2016 champion Garbine Muguruza were sent packing. Muguruza has recently appeared out of sorts, with the world number 10 racking up early losses in Madrid, Rome and Rabat, but appeared to be in good touch early in her opening round match with veteran Estonian Kaia Kanepi and took the first set 6-2. But the ever-dangerous Kanepi, who made the quarter-finals at this year's Australian Open roared back into the match to take it 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 as a frustrated Muguruza slapped the court with her racquet. Kanepi, who has twice made the final eight at Roland Garros — the last time in 2012 — and won the girl's singles back in 2001 simply showed too much class for Muguruza as she out-hit her, cranking winners from both side in the later sets. For the 36-year-old Kanepi, the win opens up her part of the draw which includes fellow Estonian, fifth-seed Anett Kontaveit. Asked how she turned the match around Kanepi said: ""I didn't change much, I just made more balls and my serve was better in the second and third sets."" Her dismissal of Muguruza followed the tournament opening with a shock on Court Phillipe-Chartrier as sixth-seed Jabeur, who has been one of the form players on tour this year, was ousted in three sets by Poland's Magda Linette. Jabeur became the first major casualty when she crashed out with a 3-6, 7-6(7/4), 7-5 loss to the world number 52. Jabeur, seen as one of the big threats to world number one Iga Świątek at the tournament, came to Paris at a career-high ranking and with a tour-leading 17 wins on the surface this season. ""I wanted to go as far as I could in the tournament because I played well on clay in Madrid and in Rome, and it's difficult to take that one in,"" Jabeur said. ""But that's what sport is like and you need to be smart enough to move forward and get back on court. So maybe it was a good thing to lose today. ""I would rather say this and be really tough with myself than waste all the good energy that I got from Madrid and Rome."" With her win in Madrid and runner-up finishes in Rome and Charleston, it appeared Jabeur would have an easy outing against Linette when she made a strong start. The 27-year-old suffered an early break of serve before breezing through the opening set in 37 minutes before Linette raised her game. Linette, 30, had only defeated Jabeur in the first of their four meetings back in 2013 but she staged an inspired fightback in the second set, saving four break points to level the match in the tiebreak. As drops of rain fell on the main showcourt, Jabeur's level also dipped and her unforced errors climbed and she made her frustration evident by kicking balls away after losing points. Linette, who lost to Jabeur in the third round last year, went up 4-2 in the third set but saw her advantage slip away when Jabeur broke her serve back to stay alive. But the Pole sealed the match when the Tunisian wasted a 40-0 lead in the 12th game and found the net on match point to be broken for the second time in the set. ""I lost to her last year here, and then this year in Miami, and so I kind of knew what to expect,"" Linette said. ""I knew that she was really on fire this time and I would really need to play point by point, be really mentally tough. I'm really happy that I managed to stay really calm and strong."" Right at the end of a long, largely wretched day, Australian tennis has found its saviour on a shocking Sunday at the French Open. Step forward never-say-die qualifier Jason Kubler, who finally put a first-round victory on the board at 9.40pm at Roland Garros, more than 10-and-a-half hours after play on a brutally hard opening day began. The first four Aussies in action — Chris O'Connell, Alexei Popyrin, Astra Sharma and Thanasi Kokkinakis — had already bitten the red dust. Then Kubler, the man perhaps least fancied to negotiate his first-round tie, stepped up in the darkness — with the floodlights shining on the ominously numbered Court 13 — and saved the day. The one-time wonder boy of Australian tennis — who had battled through three tough qualifying matches to get to the main draw — defeated streetwise American Denis Kudla 7-6(7/5), 7-6(7/2), 7-6(7/3) to become the first of the 11-strong contingent to make it through. Sydney wildcard O'Connell had kicked off the singles challenge on a humid morning with high hopes, only to depart Court 8 wholly deflated by a 2-6, 4-6, 7(7/5)-6, 1-6 loss to Slovenian Aljaz Bedene. Next to fall was last year's ""big thing"", Popyrin, whose 2022 struggles continued at the hands of Fabio Fognini, the erratic 34-year-old Italian swashbuckler who found the odd touch of his old magic as he gave the young Sydneysider a bit of a lesson 6-4, 7-5, 6-4. Perth's Australian number two Sharma, the first woman in action, came agonisingly close to victory over Varvara Gracheva, standing just two points away from winning when a startling pass from the Russian kick-started her revival to win 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. Sharma was so shocked by Gracheva's winner that she actually applauded her in the heat of battle. Kokkinakis got involved in a real slugfest with Spanish clay-court specialist Albert Ramos-Vinolas, and looked shattered to go down 4-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-7(7/5) in a see-saw four-setter. The pain was obvious for the Adelaide man, who missed out on a second-round date with Spain's new teenage comet Carlos Alcaraz, who just got better and better as he pulverised Argentine Juan Ignacio Londero 6-4, 6-2, 6-0. But former junior world number one Kubler — who'd saved a match point in his second round qualifier against Radu Albot — simply would not be denied as night fell, proving just too teak-tough in each of three tiebreaks that he dominated. He had two match points denied by the American before he hammered a glorious winning backhand down the line in front of a by-now sparse crowd after more than three-and-a-quarter hours, letting out a primal roar.

6,Kiwi blasts round Indy 500 track at 376 kph to set new pole speed record,sport," Sport Flying Kiwi Scott Dixon sets new pole speed record at Indianapolis 500 Kiwi driver Scott Dixon has smashed the Indianapolis 500 pole-winning record with a breathtaking qualifying run of more than 376 kph. His hands were shaking when he climbed from his car following his first run on Sunday, but the New Zealander was nonplussed and went back out for an incredible final run. His four-lap average of 376.661 kph around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway gave Dixon the fifth Indy 500 pole of his career. He will lead the field to green next Sunday local time (Monday AEST). ""That's what this place is about, the ups and downs that you have just in one day, it's crazy,"" Dixon said. ""I think that's kind of what we all secretly thrive on, right? To live on that edge is an amazing feeling and when you do nail it, that's what it's all about. ""Days like these are amazing."" Considered the best driver of his generation, Dixon's average broke Scott Brayton's pole-winning record of 376.1 kph set in 1996. Arie Luyendyk holds the overall four-lap qualifying record of 381.4 kph, also done in 1996, but not in a run for the pole. Dixon's qualifying run was the second-fastest in 106 runnings of the prestigious race. Dixon's first lap was an eye-popping 377.3 kph and drew a roar from the fans. His second lap was 376.8 kph, leading wife Emma to bend over the pit wall in amazement, her hands covering her mouth. Dixon's drop-off from there was minuscule: his fourth and final lap was 376.1 kph as his consistency gave Chip Ganassi Racing its seventh Indy 500 pole. ""The first number does mean a lot, and when I saw 234 [miles per hour], it was 'OK, this is going to be a good run,'"" Dixon said. ""But you're busy, you're consumed. Gone on the early years of just hitting the apexes and enjoying the speed."" Dixon also started from the pole in 2008 when he scored his only Indy 500 win, as well as in 2015, 2017 and last year. Reigning IndyCar champion Alex Palou said he knew he would be beaten by his teammate. ""There was not a lot of nerves, I kinda knew he was going to get it,"" Palou said. ""I was super comfortable and I did everything I had. ""I kind of wish because Scott already had four poles here, he could have given me one, but he doesn't share much."" ""I think we could have put rocket fuel in our engine and, I still think, not beat Scott,"" third-place qualifier Rinus VeeKay said. ""He was not just a fraction faster, he was a lot faster than everyone else.""

7,Manchester City's stunning comeback wins Premier League title before rival keeper hit in post-match pitch invasion ,sport,"  Manchester City claim Premier League title on dramatic final day of action Manchester City have produced a stunning come-from-behind victory to shatter Liverpool's hopes and once again be crowned champions of the English Premier League on a dramatic final day, with Ilkay Gundogan the hero. However, the joy in Manchester led to the latest in a series of pitch invasions — at various levels in English football — which have caused concerns for the safety of players and others. Elated fans rushed the pitch after Manchester City clinched a 3-2 win over Aston Villa to secure the club's fourth Premier League crown in five seasons. It nearly turned nasty, however, as Villa keeper Robin Olsen was hit by a fan in the melee as he tried to make his way off the ground. Manchester City later released a statement apologising to Olsen: ""Manchester City would like to sincerely apologise to Aston Villa goalkeeper Robin Olsen, who was assaulted after the final whistle at today's match when fans entered the pitch,"" the club said in the statement. ""The club has launched an immediate investigation and, once identified, the individual responsible will be issued with an indefinite stadium ban."" Going into their final match of the season with a one-point lead over the Reds, the equation had been simple for City: beat Aston Villa and become champions, but on the day it proved harder. City were down 1-0 at half-time after Matthew Cash scored for Villa, while Liverpool were level with Wolverhampton at 1-1 and level on the ladder with City on 90 points (but behind on goal difference) as the title race went into the final 45 minutes of the season. City's problems were then compounded when former Reds midfielder Philippe Coutinho, helping out the club he scored 41 goals for, doubled Villa's lead in the 67th minute. The goal was as simple as they come as Ollie Watkins headed on from a long Olsen goal kick, and the former Liverpool midfielder Coutinho produced a brilliant first touch to cut inside and then drilled the ball into the bottom corner. At the same time Liverpool were pressing against Wolves but couldn't find their moment as Anfield was on edge. With 15 minutes to go it seemed City might have blown their title chance until 5 minutes of play changed the complexion of the title race. First, Gundogan struck in the 76th minute as he headed in a Raheem Sterling cross to make it 2-1 to Villa. Then two minutes later Rodri levelled for City as the Spaniard side-footed an Oleksandr Zinchenko pull back into the net from outside the area. And then Gundogan struck again on 81 minutes as he tapped in a Kevin de Bruyne cross to give City a 3-2 lead with what would be the goal that sealed the title, despite Liverpool going on to defeat Wolves 3-1 after late goals to Mohamed Salah and Andrew Robertson. Gundogan himself was stunned with the comeback. ""It was an unbelievable game, I don't know what to say to be honest,"" he said. ""It's been fantastic, the last 20 minutes, scoring three goals, unbelievable. ""After going 2-0 down, the chances were very, very small. ""I think we had to do the simple things again in the best possible way and scoring the two goals in three minutes gave us the right lift. ""We are proud of ourselves today."" The title is City's fourth in five seasons but the first time that they have claimed the title at home. For Liverpool, it was a day of disappointment, the mood at Anfield different to the one of joy in Manchester but that could change next week when they take on Real Madrid in the Champions League final next weekend in Paris. ""The lads have given everything, so you can't have too many issues,"" Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson told Sky Sports. ""We've given absolutely everything all season, right until the last day, and in January we'd have bit your hand off to take it to the last day. ""We're a bit disappointed today. We've got to say congratulations to City, of course, and then focus on the match next week."" While not winning the title was difficult for Liverpool, it was a much worse day for Burnley, who after seven seasons in the top-flight will drop to The Championship. Needing a win to stay ahead of Leeds, Burnley fell to Newcastle 2-1, as Leeds managed a 2-1 victory over Brentford to secure another season in the Premier League.

8,Ariarne Titmus breaks world record in 400m free as Kyle Chalmers confirms World Championships tilt,sport," Sport Ariarne Titmus breaks Katie Ledecky's 400m freestyle world record at Australian Swimming Championships Ariarne Titmus has broken the women's 400 metre freestyle world record at the Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide. Her time of 3:56.40 beat Katie Ledecky's old record by 0.06 seconds. It's the second world record set at the Australian Championships after Zac Stubblety-Cook set a new 200 metre breaststroke record. ""I'm just really happy,"" Titmus said after the race. Ledecky's record of 3:56.46 was set nearly six years ago during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Titmus and Ledecky have a great rivalry, with the American coming second to Titmus in the 200m and 400m finals at the Tokyo Olympics, but Ledecky turned the tables in the 800m. Titmus said she still believed Ledecky was the greatest female swimmer of all time. ""I can't put myself up next to her. What she has done for female swimming has been insane: She's been at this level for 10 years,"" Titmus said. ""To be in the conversation with her, I feel completely honoured. ""I hope now this is going to keep the battle going — give her some drive, hopefully, we can see how much faster we can keep going,"" she said. Titmus said she wasn't targeting the world record. ""I thought that if I went out there and did the best race I could with how I'm feeling, the world record was definitely within my reach,"" she said. ""I try not to think about it. I think, if you think about it, your race plan comes undone."" Titmus said she was currently the happiest she's ever been in her life, in and out of the pool. ""I'm definitely not putting the pressure on myself that I used to, but it's still like a healthy amount,"" she said. ""And I think that has been the trick to me swimming well — just going out there being completely fearless — swimming what I used to feel like when I was 16. ""Olympic gold was obviously my childhood dream and I feel like I now have that invincibility in swimming, and it has translated to my life outside of the pool. ""Swimming's still my priority, but I feel like I have a great balance out of the pool as well, and that's definitely helping my swimming."" She said, at just 22, she had a lot more left to give to the sport. ""My position as an athlete, I'm just not here to create great sporting moments, but I feel I can be relatable to these younger people,"" she said. ""Coming from a regional town out of Tassie, I feel like I can stamp that message that it doesn't matter who you are and where you come from, that you can achieve great things."" Titmus has elected not to contest the World Championships in Budapest next month but will, instead, concentrate on the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in July. Olympic gold medallist Kyle Chalmers has confirmed that he will swim butterfly events at the World Championships. The decision means pop-star-turned-swimmer Cody Simpson has missed out on an individual spot after he came third behind Chalmers and winner Matt Temple in the 100m butterfly final at the Australian titles. Chalmers won the men's 50m butterfly final at the championships, which are doubling as the selection trials for the World Championships and Commonwealth Games. Originally, Chalmers said that he would not go to the World Championships, then hinted he had changed his mind after his strong showing in Adelaide. When it was put to him last week that, if he decided to compete, Simpson would miss out on a spot, Chalmers replied: ""Well you can't make me out to be the villain, right?"" Chalmers returned home to Port Lincoln after the first few days of competition and, on Saturday, played in a country Australian Rules match. A Swimming Australia spokesperson said: ""The last few days have been difficult for Kyle, both mentally and emotionally, and he believes it's in the best interest of his mental health to remain in Port Lincoln with his family for the next few days."" ""Swimming Australia fully supports his decision."" Simpson has been selected for the Commonwealth Games team, capping an incredible return to swimming. He's in line to represent Australia in the individual butterfly events at the Commonwealth Games. Simpson only decided to return to swimming in 2020 after a decade-long career as a pop singer, model and actor. ""I was holding my breath all week, it was obviously a whirlwind,"" Simpson said. ""I was just trying to sort of not look at what everyone was saying and writing and posting … and just kind of stick to my guns. ""I knew I'd, hopefully, done enough, but you never know for sure until you get the message and I was sitting up in my chair, got that message, my parents both started crying and I sunk down in my chair and gave them both a big hug."" He said he understood Chalmers' decision. ""I think people like to sort of spin a story,"" he said. ""Considering the limited prep he had got up and gave an incredible effort, so nothing but respect to him for doing that and you know he's well within his rights to decide to swim."" He said his selection was testament to two years of hard work. ""I really went zero to a hundred right away and I haven't looked back since,"" Simpson said. ""It's been up and down and I've had doubts and I've had good weeks and really s*** weeks, sitting in my room, wondering if I was in over my head."" Australia will take 46 athletes to the Commonwealth Games. The youngest is 16-year-old Queenslander, Flynn Southam, who will swim the relay events. Mollie O'Callaghan, 18, has qualified for six individual events, although it remains to be seen how many she will compete in. The teams for both competitions were named at the end of Sunday night's races. While Chalmers won't swim his traditional freestyle races at the World Championships, he will at the Commonwealth Games — earning his spot courtesy of his silver medal at the Tokyo Olympic Games. It's a similar story for Tokyo golden girl Emma McKeon, who elected not to swim the trials and will also miss the World Championships, but has been named for the Commonwealth Games because of her four gold medals at the Olympics. Shayna Jack has capped her comeback from a two-year drug ban by winning the women's 50m freestyle final in 24.14 seconds: The fastest time in the world this year. She was under world record pace for the first 40 metres of the race. Jack, who finished second in the 100m earlier in the competition, says she feels she's back where she belongs. ""I think it was nerve-wracking coming back,"" she said. ""I knew I had the support from the community and everything like that but just my personal mentality — I didn't know if I fit in as well as I used to. But you know, I walk around pool deck, head held high."" She says she's now targeting an individual medal at the World Championships and Commonwealth Games. ""Coming back we didn't know what kind of athlete I was, and I definitely came back stronger and fitter,"" she said. She said if she won, ""You might see my ugly-cry face again."" ""I probably might have a bit of a moment to myself just to realise what I've actually achieved this week 'cause I don't think I've given myself that recognition,"" Jack said. ""I've had so many messages of support and love, but I think I have to really sit down and be proud of myself and reflect on how well I've actually done.""

9,"AFL Round-Up: Demons' month of tests arrive, Tigers have that 2019 feeling",sport," Sport AFL Round-Up: Melbourne's month of tests arrive, Richmond have that 2019 feeling After 10 weeks of action the 2022 season has reached somewhat of a fork in the road, and some flag-chasing teams are about to face their biggest tests yet. Welcome to the AFL Round-Up, where we digest the week that was. You can count on one hand the amount of times the Demons have been genuinely challenged so far in 2022. Most of them have been brief charges that lasted little over a quarter and were promptly nipped in the bud, like from the Western Bulldogs on the season's opening night, or Essendon's last quarter at the MCG in round three. St Kilda probably offered up the most hearty four-quarter effort a few weeks ago and still lost by 38 points. Coming off back-to-back games against the league's worst teams — North Melbourne were gallant on Saturday arvo but still sufficiently outclassed — the time feels right for Melbourne to start facing some serious heat. The Dees' next four games sit around their round-14 bye, and come against Fremantle, Sydney, Collingwood and Brisbane. In the Dockers and Lions you have top-four fancies and teams who have at times looked like genuine threats to the Demons' throne, and in the Swans and Pies two unpredictable sides whose attacking best will threaten the Melbourne defence more than most others. The caveat is that all four of those games will be played at the MCG, but in a month's time a final verdict on just how far ahead of the pack Melbourne are will be reached. In all likelihood, this stretch will only solidify their dominance. But there's a pretty damn interesting season brewing underneath them, and the chasing pack have been biding their time, waiting for a shot at the king. Dion Prestia can sniff it. He told ABC Sport after Richmond's win over Essendon that the whiffs of 2019 are only getting stronger around Punt Road. Prestia pointed out the Tigers' record at the bye in that year — 7-6 at 91.99 per cent, and outside the top eight — and the home-stretch surge that took them to the second of their three flags. It's true the Tigers are hot right now, riding a four-game winning streak and playing football instantly recognisable as Richmond-like. But all four of those wins have come over sides unlikely to play finals this season. Much like Melbourne, the next four weeks for Richmond will be illustrative. Sydney at the SCG, before Port Adelaide, Carlton and Geelong at the MCG is the task before them. For Prestia's vibes to be proven right, they need to win all four of them. But that's not beyond Richmond in a competition that, aside from Melbourne at the top and some battlers at the bottom, is remarkably even. For the next few weeks at least, Richmond remain on top of the watchlist. The Round-Up has been a very pro-Hawk space this season, and yet again Sam Mitchell's men proved why. Hawthorn play attacking, uncompromising footy no matter the opposition, and have now another massive scalp in the bag in the Lions. The margin may have flattered St Kilda slightly, but they were good value for their win in Adelaide. Beating the Crows down there is no walk in the park anymore, so this win is a serious feather in the Saints' cap. Carlton are the best watch in the league right now, largely because they are so wildly unpredictable. It might not be easy on the hearts of Blues fans, but it's a hell of a good time for the rest of us. Geelong's win over Port Adelaide was hardly a classic, but Jeremy Cameron's boundary-line barrel after the 3QT siren means nobody inside Kardinia Park will soon forget it. Every bit as good as Mitch Duncan's last year. This coaching caper is a walk in the park for Mark McVeigh. Unfortunately for him and the Giants, they won't get to play West Coast every week — and coughing up 86 points to the Eagles is a bit of a worry too. Freo must be cursing La Niña. Their last two games have been played in the wet, and on both occasions they have failed to find a way to score. The Dockers' excellent season has hit its first major speed bump, and the Demons, Lions and Hawks await before the bye. The Bulldogs won on Saturday by finding a way to negate Jarrod Witts's influence and keeping the midfield battle scrappy. The Suns deserve credit for running it all the way to the wire, but the game was never really on their terms. Here we take stock of who is leading the race for the season's individual awards. The Rising Star battle is getting interesting, and it's a couple of mature-age players who deserve to be leading the way right now. We've had Nic Martin in front for the last few weeks, and he'll stay there for now, but his closest challenger is now clearly Jai Newcombe. The draft class of 2021 is having a quiet few weeks, though Ben Hobbs is worthy of a mention as his career starts to really warm up. It's hard to believe it's taken this long for Jeremy Howe to appear in this section, but his grab in the wet against Freo is our mark of the week. It's right up there for the year too, but for now Cam Zurhaar's lead remains. And for the hell of it, Jeremy Cameron's torp can be goal of the week, just so we can watch it again. Not quite enough to knock Ed Langdon off the top of the leaderboard though.

10,Ultra-marathon winner reveals secret formula after 231km desert race,sport,"  West Macs Monster ultra-marathon winner's finishing time under 47 hours An ultra-marathon runner who only started in the sport three years ago says his 231km desert triumph was ""an eating competition, with some running thrown in"". Scottish-born Nick Bamford was smiling, standing and coherent on Sunday after running for almost two days straight with no sleep. ""The main limit on your speed is how well you can eat,"" the 36-year-old said. Mr Bamford completed the Sonder Monster in Central Australia in 46 hours, 57 minutes and two seconds. He was sustained by water, energy gels and McDonald's meals brought to him by his crew during two cold nights where the temperature dropped below 5 degrees Celsius and long days under the harsh desert sun. The race began with a steep, rocky climb to the top of Mount Sonder and continued along the entire length Larapinta Trail west of Alice Springs - a journey which most people took at least a fortnight to hike. ""Every other step I felt like I was kicking a rock,"" Mr Bamford said. ""My mother often asks what is it that I'm running away from."" He said he loved being on the trail and hanging out with the people and volunteers. ""It is really just a fun thing, I don't really have a deeper story than that,"" he said. Mr Bamford said he would recover from his win and then launch into training for his next challenge: the ultra trail du Mont-Blanc in France, in August. The Sonder Monster record is still held by 2019 winner Shane Johnstone, who completed the race in 40 hours, 55 minutes and 18 seconds. Returning 2021 champion Elizabeth Woodgate, 58, finished in 58 hours, 20 minutes and 57 seconds. The West Macs Monster annual running festival in Central Australia includes five events of various lengths along the Larapinta Trail. The second longest event, the 128km Ellery Monster, was won by Daniel James in a course record of 19 hours, 31 minutes and five seconds. Reesha Lewis, 35, was the first woman to cross the finish line in 22 hours, 31 minutes and 37 seconds. ""Six years ago I was 142kg and over three and a half years I lost that naturally through exercise and healthy eating,"" Ms Lewis said. She said she started running ultra-marathons after succeeding at an elite level in mountain running and boxing. ""I've found my passion, my calling - I just love it,"" she said. Ms Lewis said she took a couple of tumbles early on in the race and badly injured her knee 17km from the start line, but it never occurred to her to pull out. ""I'm here to complete a race,"" she said. The Ellery Monster is the longest race Ms Lewis has completed. She said she had dreams days before the race about sitting on a rock in the dark, crying. ""That didn't happen - it was actually beautiful,"" she said. ""There's like nothing out there - it's pitch black. It's just you and your headlamp. ""You just get in your zone and enjoy it.""

11,North Queensland have been the surprise packet of 2022 – now they'll be put to the ultimate test,sport," Sport Campo's Corner: We're about to find out if North Queensland are for real When it comes to the NRL premiership, right now there's Penrith and there's Melbourne and somewhere in the back is everybody else. Don't be fooled by the damp squib the two runaway leaders served up at Magic Round, where the Panthers arrived locked and loaded and the Storm kept their powder dry. They are still the class of this competition, the twin suns around which the rest of the league is in constant orbit. There's only one way to join this very exclusive club and that's by beating one of the existing members. Even if you crash to a loss the following week, like Parramatta did against the Roosters barely seven days after they lowered Penrith's colours, it's a piece of street cred not soon forgotten. That's what North Queensland, the surprise packets of the 2022 season, are playing for over the next fortnight, when they ride the lightning and take on both of the top two. Through ten rounds, the Cowboys have earned curiosity from the many who tipped them to finish in the doldrums yet again, now it's time to see if they can win some attention. The numbers are strong for Todd Payten's side. They're sitting in third spot, having won five in a row. In their last four games they've scored 30 points or more, and through the entire season they've conceded just 125 points, which is fewer than any other team bar Penrith. But the stats only tell half the story. This is a team playing with swagger, with a fearsome certainty that there is a vibe around the place right now. Chad Townsend, the most maligned purchase of the off-season, is playing his best football in years and Tom Dearden, who plenty were ready to throw on the scrap heap at 19, is proving why there were so many wraps on him as a schoolboy. Murray Taulagi is throwing passes we don't have names for. Prop forward Reuben Cotter is running 60 metres to score tries while dummying to nobody. Backrower Jeremiah Nanai has scored eight tries, all of them off kicks, all of them with a nose for the ball that would bring a tear to Matt Sing's eye. After two years where he looked mortal due to broken hands and rule changes, Jason Taumalolo is once again looking like that old strength which could move earth and heaven. But the one Cowboy who sums up what the club has fast become is fullback Scott Drinkwater. The 25-year old is as gifted a creative attacking player as there is in the NRL – his speed, footwork, kicking game and ability to play both within and outside structure make him dangerous all over the field, while his left to right cut-out pass is nice enough to take home and introduce to the family. Those qualities have always existed within Drinkwater. The Storm know it better than most, because it was at the Storm where he was originally earmarked as Billy Slater's long-term replacement. He was that classic Melbourne story – a junior they scouted and stashed in the Queensland Cup for seasoning, hidden away north of the border from all but the keenest eyes. Drinkwater won the starting fullback job in the 2019 pre-season after Slater's retirement, but tore his pectoral muscle in a trial game and missed half the year. He was replaced by Jahrome Hughes, who played so well he was shoehorned into halfback once Ryan Papenhuyzen's name had gone from difficult to pronounce to up in bright lights, and the horse had pretty much bolted. The other player to slot in at fullback for Melbourne that year was Nicho Hynes. These days, that's three of the biggest names in the game, who have had so much happen to them with plaudits and premierships and contracts so big they make your head spin. All of that could have happened to Drinkwater, if he hadn't had some bad luck at the worst time, and with the path to first grade so crowded once he returned he transferred north to Townsville, where he split time between the halves and fullback for the next two seasons. Drinkwater's attack remained strong once he headed north – he won Player of the Tournament honours at the Perth Nines in 2020 – but defensive issues stopped him from hitting true NRL stardom. He wasn't even in the team to begin this season. Hamsio Tabuai-Fidow was preferred at fullback until injury opened the door for Drinkwater to line up at fullback once again, and his return coincided with the Cowboys transforming into what they have become. Townsend is a workmanlike and intelligent half, a product of his long experience at the top level, Dearden is feisty and clever, hooker Reece Robson is quite possibly the most underrated player in the NRL, but Drinkwater provides the touch of class that makes the Cowboys rise above the teams they've dispatched in recent weeks. If this is the moment it happens for Drinkwater, if this current run of form is not just another good patch but a transition from good first-grader to something more than that, there are few limits to what he can achieve. But to be one of those guys you can't just do it against the rest, it must also happen when you take on the best. Drinkwater comes full circle this weekend when the Cowboys play Melbourne on Saturday and for an added twist, have a guess who the Storm were playing against when he tore his pec and lost the jersey he'd rightfully won? It was, of course, the Cowboys. You can poke holes in Payten's team if you really try. They've lost to the Bulldogs and Warriors this year. They have that brutalising win over Parramatta, a 35-4 belting in the Northern Territory heat which was quickly forgotten when the Eels beat Penrith the following week, but their only other game against the current top six came when they lost badly to a Roosters side that was still finding their own way. But that defeat, plus the two earlier losses, was before Drinkwater came back into the side, before everything changed, before they saddled up for what is increasingly look like a ride to the top four. So this is where we are. This is the time to find out. The Storm might be missing Papenhuyzen and Reimis Smith and Nelson Asofa-Solomona, but they are still favourites because they are the Storm, a champion side even when they don't win the title. It is time for the Cowboys to go big-game hunting, and if they end up with the Storm's head on their mantle they won't be a surprise packet anymore, there will be no more ambushes, they'll go through the rest of the year knowing they matched it with the best and teams will circle them on the calender. They won't get a better chance than this to prove their mettle, to themselves and the wider football world. Apart from Melbourne's absences, this one is at North Queensland Stadium, where the fans show up in droves even in the tough times, so when times are good the seats sell faster than a cold beer on a humid Townsville afternoon. As of Thursday, 21,500 punters have already snapped up a ticket. This is a fanbase who has been out of the finals for five years and have never really had a premiership contender on their hands without Johnathan Thurston being involved. They never stop believing, but now they're ready to start winning. Next week will be a different case altogether. Winter has come to New South Wales, Penrith is colder than anywhere else in Sydney and going into the screaming black hole of madness out at Panthers Stadium is an easy to way to finish a night battered, bruised, beaten and feeling bad about yourself. But if the Cowboys beat the Storm and look good doing it, North Queensland vs Penrith becomes a top of the table clash, first vs second, and maybe we'll get that game of the year we thought would happen at Magic Round. Maybe two really can turn into three. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

12,US Soccer's equal pay deal is just one battle in football's gender equality war,sport,"  The US Soccer equal pay deal is revolutionary, but more must be done to achieve true gender equality Over the past 30 years, the United States has been a trailblazer in women's football and the wider women's sport movement. They won the first official FIFA Women's World Cup against Norway back in 1991. They set a new world record for attendance at a women's sports event (90,185) when they hosted and won the tournament against China in 1999, and became the outright most dominant women's national team in football history when they won their third world title in 2015 and their fourth in 2019. The USA has continued to set benchmarks off the field, too. The introduction of Title IX by the federal government in 1972 ensured that women athletes at college level were provided with the same opportunities as their male counterparts, creating a youth development system that is still unrivalled across world sport. And in 2016, the US women's national team became the first of its kind to publicly sue their governing body over ""institutionalised gender discrimination"": a drawn-out legal process that was settled earlier this year and has since become representative of the structural challenges still faced by women in their fight for equality in sport, as well as by women in workplaces across the globe. This week, the USA added yet another victory to its already-heaving CV, becoming the latest nation to implement equal pay across its men's and women's senior national teams, joining countries like Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the Netherlands and Norway in creating contractual structures whereby players are paid the same. But unlike those nations, the USA has taken its newest collective bargaining agreement even further. Although the men's and women's teams negotiated separate agreements with US Soccer, the two sides will now be on an equal playing field in several areas: It's on this last point that the US Soccer deal is truly revolutionary. World Cup prize money has been one of the biggest sticking points for achieving genuine equal pay among national teams in football, primarily due to the massive disparities between the bonuses offered by FIFA and its member confederations to men's and women's teams who participate in their tournaments. At the 2018 men's World Cup, FIFA allocated a total prize pot of $US400 million to be distributed across all competing teams, with higher bonuses being given to teams the further they progressed. The winning national team, France, were awarded $US40 million for taking out the title. At the 2019 Women's World Cup, the total pot allocated by FIFA was just $U30 million, while the winners — the USA — collected $US4 million. Australia's progress in both of these tournaments demonstrates the disparities. While the Socceroos received around $8 million ($US5.6 million) just for qualifying for Russia (before failing to win a single game in the group stage), the Matildas received just $1 million ($US700,000) for reaching the quarter-final in France. These inequalities have appeared so insurmountable that they have shaped negotiations around closing the pay gap to the point where, until this week's deal, no other nation — including Australia — had specific mechanisms in place to equalise World Cup prize money. When asked why a shared prize money pool was not included in the Socceroos and Matildas' CBA that was negotiated in 2019, PFA co-chief executive Kate Gill said the prize money problem ought to be solved at its source rather than asking players themselves to negotiate with one another. ""FIFA continues to be the source of clear gender discrimination in relation to pay with the Women's World Cup prize money representing less than 14 per cent of what is awarded at the men's World Cup,"" Gill told ABC. ""In perpetuating this cycle, FIFA clearly fails to meet its human rights obligations and players are left to solve problems that are not of their making. ""Ahead of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFA was obliged to undertake a comprehensive Human Rights Risk Assessment. The report identified the lack of parity in prize money as a clear failure to respect the human rights of players and recommends that FIFA address this. ""If it is not addressed, Australia risks co-hosting a tournament that celebrates women but fails to treat the best players on the planet as equals."" Australia's approach to the prize money problem — which they launched as part of a campaign before the 2019 Women's World Cup — further differs from that of the USA in that it aims to assist other nations who may not have robust structures in place such as player unions or collective bargaining agreements, or whose cultures and national teams do not have the same global profile. It does this by making the overarching governing bodies of FIFA and its confederations responsible for investing in progress and equality instead of putting the burden on players themselves. However, given FIFA's glacial pace at redressing historical inequities in the women's game, it's understandable why federations like the USA are taking these measures of their own accord. Indeed, it's hoped that this week's revolutionary deal will act as a rising tide to lift the boats of other federations in the absence of genuine moves by FIFA and its confederations to pursue and embed gender equality within its structures. As US Soccer president and former US women's national team player Cindy Parlow-Cone said after the announcement: ""This is going to have ramifications throughout not only the footballing world, but the sports world. ""I'm really proud that we were the first country [to equalise prize money], but I would certainly hope we're not the last. ""I will work to continue to encourage CONCACAF [The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football] and FIFA to move in this direction as well. I think we do have willing partners there, but I don't think things are going to move as fast as we would all like for them to."" Indeed, the USA's equal pay deal is just one piece of the larger puzzle of true gender equality in the game — the vast majority of which exists below the pointy end of the football pyramid. For example, one of the reasons why the US men's national team was willing to give up a portion of their prize money in order to supplement the pay of their women colleagues was because they can afford to: the vast majority of income earned by male players in football comes from the club game, while women players derive a much higher percentage of their income from national team football. With club football taking on an increasingly important role in the lives of national team players, addressing pay inequality at this level is paramount. In Australia's A-Leagues, the minimum wage for a male player in the A-League Men's competition currently sits around $45,000 for a full-time 52-week season, which includes pre-season and a four-week finals series (and increases incrementally with age). However, while the league CBAs include a ""same base hourly rate"" principle for men and women players, the shorter length of the part-time A-League Women's season (23 weeks) means the minimum salary for women sits much lower at roughly $17,000. The A-League Women continues to lag behind other leagues overseas, but the APL's new private equity investment could change the game. In addition, male players also benefit from much more robust and supported youth development pathways, leading into full-time footballing careers in domestic leagues around the world from an earlier age. This is further complemented by domestic and global transfer systems that incentivise clubs and leagues to prioritise the development and opportunities for male players, selling them onto bigger clubs elsewhere for profit at the expense of working with emerging women players, whose own transfer market is only just emerging. Even beyond football, male players often sign much more lucrative sponsorship deals with brands and other organisations, in addition to having a far greater reach in terms of media coverage, marketing, and post-game opportunities in punditry and administration compared with women athletes. So while the USA's new equal pay deal is an unprecedented step for women's football and the women's sports movement more broadly, and will hopefully inspire other nations like Australia to continue updating their own agreements, it forms just one part of a much larger revolution that must take place if true equality in football is to be achieved.

13,"Brumbies, Waratahs face challenge of restoring self-belief as finals approach",sport," Sport Brumbies, NSW Waratahs face challenge of restoring self-belief ahead of Super Rugby Pacific finals In past seasons, all five Australian teams getting beaten by New Zealand opposition in a single weekend would have been cause for panic and ignited commentary pointing to the results as proof the game of rugby was dying in Australia. The five Australian sides did all lose to New Zealand teams last weekend, but there has been no panic so far and the ""doom and gloom"" commentary also hasn't surfaced. And why is that, you would be excused for wondering? For starters, reports of the game's death in Australia have always been exaggerated. Also, after a much-improved showing from Australian teams against New Zealand opposition in 2022 — and with already three times as many wins across the first four cross-over rounds this season as were recorded across the five weeks of Super Rugby trans-Tasman in 2021 — last weekend was quickly seen to be an anomaly. Of course, the results and the performances can all be better, and none of these opening paragraphs are trying to suggest that everything is awesome. Indeed, the Queensland Reds, Melbourne Rebels and Western Force remain desperate to convert a couple of close losses into their first cross-over wins. The Rebels and Force are facing mathematical tasks to break into the top eight, but the Reds are right in the thick of it and should still be eyeing off the fourth-place finish that still dangles in front of them, albeit with a few conditions applied. The return of back rowers Harry Wilson and Fraser McReight this week will certainly make a difference for the Reds as they host Moana Pasifika in Brisbane on Friday night, while the inclusion of James O'Connor — with a week under his belt after returning from injury — can only help as well. The Waratahs and Brumbies, though, have a slightly bigger challenge this weekend. The Waratahs face the Highlanders in Dunedin and the Brumbies host the Blues in a top-of-the-table clash at Canberra Stadium. Both Australian sides went down in close contests last weekend after a string of wins. The Brumbies may concede they made too many mistakes and gifted the Crusaders far too big a first-half lead in their 37-26 loss to the New Zealanders in Canberra last Friday night. The Waratahs will still be smarting from a second-half capitulation in which the Hurricanes did not take the lead for the first time in the match until the 75th minute. Both sides know they can beat New Zealand teams, as they have shown through their results this season. They need to recapture the belief and mindset that had served them quite well until round 13. And they need to do that because there are now only two games left before the finals series begins. ""We still want to go into the quarter-finals with momentum,"" Waratahs assistant coach Chris Whitaker said in Sydney on Tuesday. The Highlanders have vaulted into the top eight — at the expense of the Force and Rebels — on the back of three straight wins after a torrid run through the first 10 rounds. ""They [Highlanders] played good footy at the start of the year but lost a couple of games on the bell,"" Whitaker said. ""They're definitely dangerous … obviously with [All Blacks scrum-half] Aaron Smith steering them around the park. ""An Australian team hasn't won [in Dunedin] since 2014 so we know it's going to be a big battle."" The Waratahs have a few more players available for the clash with the Highlanders. Wallabies captain Michael Hooper is ready to go again after sitting out last weekend's loss to the Hurricanes at Leichhardt Oval, and Ned Hanigan is set to pull on a Waratahs jersey for the first time in nearly two years after returning from Japan. Similarly, the Brumbies will welcome fly half Noah Lolesio back to steer the team around again, with the Canberra-based side facing the first-placed Blues in a match that could have a major impact on the top two. ""Noah's been our first-choice 10 for a couple of years now, and it certainly gives the team a lift just having him fit and available,"" Brumbies coach Dan McKellar said on Wednesday The Brumbies played an uncharacteristic brand of rugby to trail the Crusaders 23-5 at half-time last Friday night, before clicking into gear and running in three tries to two in the second half to prove to themselves their game plan still worked. ""There was a lot to take out of it, in terms of belief and confidence,"" McKellar said of his side's strong second half once they had overcome their error-strewn first half against the Crusaders. Belief and confidence quickly emerge as key themes going into their huge clash with the Blues this weekend and they will remain so going forward into the finals. At this time of the season, most tweaks are mental. ""You look at the Rebels and their previous fortnight [before their three-point loss to the Chiefs last weekend], and it just sums up that so much of it is between the ears and mindset,"" McKellar said. ""We're certainly no different. We've got to be in the right place mentally to deliver what you need to deliver physically and obviously in these games you've got to be brutal and physical. ""Having that intent and that mindset is a massive part of that.""

14,"Australia has a genuine contender at this year's Giro d'Italia, and he's sitting just 20 seconds off the pace",sport," Sport Jai Hindley caps impressive opening week at Giro d'Italia, although Caleb Ewan still hunts for stage wins We're nine stages into this year's Giro d'Italia and, in Jai Hindley, Australia has a rider within striking distance of the overall race lead. Hindley currently sits in fifth place, 20 seconds behind overall leader Juan Pedro López Pérez. However, if you exclude Pérez, who is unlikely to stick with the climbers as the Giro progresses, Hindley is in an even stronger position, just eight seconds adrift of João Almeida, six back from Romain Bardet and five behind Richard Carapaz. This was just the second of seven mountainous stages on the program at this year's race, so it's important not to get carried away with things, but the early form looks promising for the 26-year-old West Australian. The most pleasing sign moving forward was the way he mixed it with the leaders on the most significant test of the Giro to date, Sunday's 191km-long, mountainous ninth stage — not that it was easy. ""I didn't really expect to take the win today,"" an exhausted Hindley said post-race. ""I was on the edge all the way up the mountain, trying to survive as best I could. ""I rode my own pace, and suffered pretty badly in the end. ""In the last kilometre everything came together and I knew about the right turn before the finish so I went through there first and just gave it my all until the finish."" The brutal stage, which culminated at the top of the fearsome Blockhaus climb, 200km east of Rome in Italy's Apennine region, was a significant moving day for the leading contenders at this year's race. Team Ineos Grenadiers clearly marked the stage as one where significant gains could be made, with the notorious train of riders clad in red and black setting a terrific pace at the front of the group, obliterating the peloton on the lower slopes of the climb. Hindley's fellow Aussie Richie Porte drove what remained of the lead group further into the red zone as the road ramped up, shedding all but six of the best — one of whom was his fellow countryman, Hindley. Despite being distanced initially by some tremendous surges from pre-race favourites Carapaz, Romain Bardet and Mikel Landa, Hindley held onto his form enough to regain contact and eventually, somehow had enough gas to out-last an elite group of riders to cross the line first to claim his second career Giro stage win. Bora-Hansgrohe sporting director Enrico Gasparotto described Hindley's performance as incredibly good post-race. ""He was always up there when the race exploded on the last part of the climb. He rode his own pace and was able to re-join the three leaders when they tried to shake him off,"" he said. The victory puts Hindley in a strong position to once again challenge for a podium, just as he did in his breakout 2020 performance, finishing second overall. With last year a write off for Hindley due to injury and illness — he abandoned the Giro with a saddle sore after 14 stages — this win and return to form will have the Australian once again dreaming of pink. ""We [Team Bora-Hansgrohe] came here with three leaders and big ambitions,"" Hindley said, referring to Emmanuel Buchmann and Wilco Kelderman. ""You shouldn't write anyone off at this point."" Buchmann sits 49 seconds behind Hindley, with Kelderman close to 11 minutes off the pace, meaning Hindley is likely to be protected as leader heading into the second week of the race — where the parcours suggests the status quo will be maintained for general classification — and the decisive third week. While Hindley has enjoyed a stage win, Caleb Ewan is still waiting to get the monkey off his back in this year's race. Ewan's first-stage crash meant that his Giro got off to the worst possible start and although he recovered and missed out on stage six by the narrowest of margins, he is yet to stand atop the podium while his key rivals, Mark Cavendish and Arnaud Démare — twice, both have. After enduring what he described as a ""sprinters nightmare"" on stage nine, Ewan likely has a handful more chances before the race reaches the Alps in the third week. That will come on Wednesday's 11th stage, a flat 203km ride from Santarcangelo di Romagna on the east coast, north to the central city of Reggio Emlia — although Tuesday's 196km roll along the Adriatic Coast from Pescara to Jesi might suit a sprinter like Ewan, should his team keep him in contention during the lumpy second half of the route. Thursday's route has three classified climbs, but a flat final 20km, which might also suit any sprinters capable of getting over those hills — including Ewan — while Friday's short-ish 150km run to Cuneo also looks promising. After that though, the roads get lumpier and the likelihood of Ewan bailing to focus on the Tour de France gets higher. Caleb Ewan will be hoping to add to his five Giro d'Italia stage wins when the year's first grand tour kicks off on Friday, but will face a daunting opponent in the sprints as Mark Cavendish makes his first Giro start in nine years. Ewan currently sits in ninth spot in the sprinters points competition, the Maglia Ciclamino, a whopping 105 points behind Demare. The Lotto-Soudal rider has not finished a Giro in four previous attempts and, with the points jersey all but out of his reach, you'd expect him to forgo the high Alps in order to better prepare for the Tour de France. Former lead out man for Cavendish, Mark Renshaw, said on SBS's coverage of the sixth stage that if Ewan didn't win then he would not win a stage at this year's race. That prediction might be tested this week, but you sense it will still be his final chance of glory at the first Grand Tour of the 2022 season.

17,'It's herstory': ParaMatildas embark on first ever CP Women's World Cup,sport," Sport 'It's herstory': ParaMatildas set to begin new chapter for Australian football at first ever CP Women's World Cup On the first day of June in 1988, 11 Australian women walked out onto a scrappy football pitch in the Chinese city of Jiangmen. The air was oppressively hot and sticky with humidity; a normal southern Chinese summer. Thousands of locals in cotton shirts and wide-brimmed hats lined the shallow stands, as curious about Westerners as they were about the sport itself. Many of them were school children who shrieked with delight at every strong tackle or big header. The game itself ebbed and flowed, but ended in a way few expected. The plucky newcomers Australia defeated the myth and might of Brazil thanks to an audacious chip by striker Janine Riddington. Their first FIFA tournament, their first match, their first win. History. Over a quarter of a million people showed up across that seven-day tournament, proving to FIFA that there was a growing appetite for women's football. The first official Women's World Cup was held three years later. It was a game and a moment that former Matildas vice-captain Moya Dodd recalls with pride at a small gathering at Valentine Sports Park in Sydney's west. She remembers being nervous, of course, but more than that, she remembers the sense of occasion. Finally, there they were. And by god, they wanted to put on a show. ""That was the first time FIFA had actually bothered to hold a women's tournament, and Australia were invited,"" Dodd tells the hushed conference room. ""I remember that time so clearly because I was actually the last player in the squad. I wasn't picked, but then someone got injured. So I was the worst player there. ""The day we played Brazil — it was the first time FIFA ever held a women's match, and we were the first match of the whole tournament — I think that was probably my best day in football, not just because we beat them one-nil, but because it was so historic."" Standing beside Dodd is inaugural Matildas captain and cap number one Julie Dolan, a force of history herself, and Rae Dower, Football Australia's first women's football technical adviser. And in front of these pioneers, 12 women in matching green-and-grey tracksuits sit listening, captivated by the Matildas' story and struck by the realisation that they, too, are about to embark on their own history-making moment. Next week, the ParaMatildas — Australia's first women's national team for footballers with cerebral palsy, acquired brain injury, and symptoms of stroke — will take part in the inaugural CP Women's World Cup in Spain. The five-a-side round-robin tournament will see Australia face some of football's powerhouse nations including the USA, Japan, Spain and the Netherlands across 10 days. Although the first CP world ahampionships were held in Denmark back in 1985, it wasn't until this year that female athletes were invited to take part. ""Moya referred to it as being historic — but it's actually herstoric,"" Dower says. ""This is a herstoric moment. The first ParaMatildas team. The first World Cup for women's CP football. ""But you've also got 43 years of the Matildas. We're there with you every step of the way. ""You're already winners. Because you have that place in herstory. ""Take the opportunity to enjoy every single moment. Smile. Breathe. And just go: 'Wow, look at us.'"" Dolan smiles. ""You're an inspiration to all of us,"" she says. ""And you'll still be an inspiration to all of us, no matter what happens."" Rae Anderson knows how it feels to create ""herstory"". The 25-year-old from Wamberal in New South Wales is one of just seven Australian para-athletes to compete at both a summer and winter Paralympics, most recently in the para-alpine skiing at the Beijing Games. But with football as her first love, Anderson says the World Cup is something different altogether. ""Growing up, my idea of sport was all about teams, about family, about community,"" Anderson told ABC. ""As a kid in primary school, soccer was my first sport. I always knew I wanted to compete for Australia; I always told Mum and Dad I'd play for my country one day. ""I didn't quite process as a kid that I had cerebral palsy — and that my dreams were probably not as achievable as 12-year-old me thought. ""It wasn't until year seven that I started finding out about para-sports; as something I could watch and could aspire to be. ""Doing sports like athletics and alpine skiing, they're very individual sports. The Paralympics was a dream and something that's given me so much opportunity and experience … but to finally be part of a team like this, and going to a World Cup for soccer, that's something really special."" Anderson's own story is a testament to the power of visibility and opportunity for athletes with disability. She remembers watching snippets of the 2012 London Paralympics on ABC television, which inspired her to pursue para-sport more seriously. She made her major tournament debut at the Commonwealth Games just two years later, competing in javelin and discus, before being selected for her first Summer Olympics in Rio. She then switched from summer athletics to winter alpine skiing, finishing seventh and 10th in the women's slalom and giant slalom events at the Winter Paralympics earlier this year. These days, Anderson is paying that inspiration forward through her work as a project coordinator with Disability Sports Australia and the Cerebral Palsy Sporting and Recreation Association, which runs 'come and try' sport programs for primary school-aged kids with disability. ""My whole introduction to sport has been about visibility and opportunity,"" she said. ""To see para-sport on tv and in the media, to see athletes with disability in marketing, to see Paralympians at the forefront of big sporting companies and brands — it's amazing. Para-alpine skier Rae Anderson places seventh in the slalom standing category in Beijing, while fellow Australian Melissa Perrine finishes her Paralympic career on an emotional note. ""I definitely look up to the Pararoos. Those boys, there's something about them: it's not just about their playing ability, but their personalities and what they bring to the sport and their enthusiasm for the next generation, especially for us as the female team coming through. ""It's so important for these younger kids to be able to see these role models and know they're still part of society, that they're part of sport, and that it's something they can be one day too."" But it's not just kids who Anderson and her ParaMatildas teammates are inspiring. It's their own coaches, as well. ""Every day I'm with these amazing players, I learn something new,"" inaugural ParaMatildas head coach Kelly Stirton said. ""The passion they have is infectious. It's life skills, it's resilience, it's that never-say-die attitude that they bring; the undefeated attitude the Pararoos and the ParaMatildas have. ""It's always about the athletes for me. They bring so much pride and joy to my life; without them, I wouldn't be here. I don't see myself as a mainstream coach, I see myself as an all-abilities coach, because that's where my passion lies. ""I can make a difference with these girls and they can make a difference for the world."" Stirton began as a game development coordinator for Capital Football, working mostly with powerchair athletes, before becoming the first woman to coach a team at the CP national championships back in 2019. That's where she met many of the players now called into the ParaMatildas team, as well as the all-woman coaching staff who will accompany her to Spain. She believes creating programs and pathways for athletes with disability at the grassroots and community level is crucial for the Australian game to grow, particularly off the back of next year's Women's World Cup on home soil. ""Pathways is the future of football. We wouldn't have any of this without those programs. Continuing to build those is really important,"" she said. ""As a country, we need to be open to change, open to inclusiveness. We're starting to do that now. I think we're gonna see all sorts of football develop in different forms like powerchair, CP football, let's bring frame football in, let's bring in blind football. ""Because football is football, you know? It shouldn't be based on gender or age or ability. It's a game that brings everyone together. ""For young athletes out there who may be in different sports but have a passion for football, yet they haven't had the chance or didn't know there was a pathway, they can now see these two teams at a CP World Cup. That's so exciting for our game."" With their eyes now turned firmly to Spain, Stirton said the team's biggest success would not necessarily be the numbers on the scoreboard. ""I think our first World Cup is all about overcoming our challenges, overcoming our fears, overcoming our anxieties of what we can achieve. ""I just want to see these girls on the pitch, enjoying their football. This is a sport that we need to enjoy; there are so many bad things happening in the world at the moment, let's try and look at the good things. ""It's all about overcoming the barriers that these athletes have had for many, many years. To be able to step onto that field with the Australian badge on is just the start. ""Results should matter in a World Cup, but being the first one for these girls, taking the pressure off them and letting them enjoy it is the main thing."" For Anderson, while she shares the drive of her teammates to come home with a medal, she knows that — just like that 1988 FIFA tournament — the biggest success will be felt long after the first one is over. Herstory, after all, starts small. It starts with pioneers like them. ""I know the girls want to do well so badly, but we haven't seen ourselves in World Cups yet. We haven't even played as a team yet,"" she said, laughing. ""Results aside, I just want these girls to get a taste of what it's like to compete at this level and what it means when you come home: the feeling of that, and how much it shapes you moving forward in your life, whether that's in sport or work or family. ""I'm already so proud. Proud of these girls and proud of everyone who's got us here. Being able to back this up after Beijing is a dream for me, but to do it with this group is something I'll never forget. ""I hope that we can be for other girls what so many athletes with disability have been for us."" You can watch all the ParaMatildas games live and free on the MyFootball Youtube Channel.

18,"Adam's parents thought he was Footscray's water boy, but their shy little boy had entered 'perpetual hell'",sport," Sport Adam Kneale was like any footy-loving boy of the 80s until a trip to Footscray’s Western Oval turned his innocent life into a nightmare For reasons that become obvious once he starts talking about his life, Adam Kneale is one of those people whose many personal qualities are hidden to all but the handful of people who know him well. WARNING: This story contains graphic descriptions of sexual abuse. Deeply caring, principled, well read and articulate, at 49, he speaks in a husky growl developed in his decades barking orders across dusty warehouses. When you listen to the things he says and the way they're phrased, you're struck by the feeling that Adam's voice is not quite his own. Loved ones accept he is almost incapable of displaying his warmth. Adam has difficulty giving and receiving presents, or even saying 'I love you'. His mother, Lyn, says it's because one of the many things that was taken from him as a boy was his ability to experience joy. Stoic above all else, Adam has never told Lyn the story of how he came to be the way he is, but she knows it. Twenty-nine years ago, sweating and overcome with nausea, she read it in an eight-page police statement that broke her heart and shattered an illusion she'd treasured — that the bubble of love she created around her family was impenetrable. ""I didn't want the explanations after that,"" Lyn says. ""I knew he'd been violated, abused, hurt, damaged for life."" Two years ago, mired in a deep personal crisis, Adam was deemed medically incapable of working. Thus ended his successful career as a commercial window-maker. A determined provider above all else, he'd spent the previous 20 years expanding his skills, extending his resume, moving further up the ladder. In his 40s, management roles stretched him too far. Only with hindsight can Adam see that the endless sprint of his work life was a vain attempt to outrun his past. Natasha, Adam's wife, explains a typical day in his final working years: at 5am, she'd wake to the familiar sound and shallow jolts to the mattress that accompanied Adam's tears. She could comfort him then. She could console him when he returned home in the same state. But not in the hours between. His second breakdown of the morning would occur before he'd even clocked on. At work, Adam was constantly frustrated, his temper boiling over at the slightest infractions of company rules. When anxiety set in, his trembling arms and legs failed him. He'd lose control of his emotions, sobbing behind his work bench, forgetting how to do a job he'd been doing for 20 years. Instead of sympathising, colleagues preyed on his emotional volatility, hiding his tools and laughing at the inevitable eruptions. There were silent battles too. If anyone watched Adam as he worked, simple tasks became insurmountable. Yet, his employers did and said almost nothing to help. ""There was a lack of empathy,"" Adam says, a great understatement. As survivors continue to come forward to tell their stories, it is surely time that major sporting institutions perform their own, unsparing investigations into historical child sexual abuse, writes Russell Jackson. In August of 2020, ""everything collapsed"". Doctors and psychologists finally stepped in, telling Adam the complex side effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were overwhelming him. His Centrelink assessment was somehow even more demoralising than the daily indignities of work. ""It was like I had to prove what happened to me,"" he says. ""And then they wouldn't let me go on it based on my mental health. It was only the fact that 20 years lifting giant plates of glass had caused injuries that required spinal surgery that got me on it."" Now, his trembling hands and legs are the by-product of an ""astronomical"" dosage of antidepressants and the debilitating anxiety that prevents him from making basic human connections. Recently, a green-thumb neighbour arrived at the door with some fruit and vegetables. Adam wanted to say hello, introduce himself and thank the man for his generosity. His mouth even shaped to deliver the words. But none came out. ""Everything just scrambled,"" he says, recalling the embarrassment and private sorrow. It made him think of what another doctor once told him: ""He said 'You need to let this go'. I said, 'Let go? It has a hold of me'."" Perhaps it is just Adam's calm, even-handed retelling of the horrifying stories of his life that throws such people, convincing them he is doing fine. For Adam, each such moment is just the latest in a series of brutal conclusions formed by people who don't know him — confirmation that what happened to him doesn't matter anymore, that maybe his life never meant anything at all. There is a handwritten note from a classmate on the back of Adam Kneale's final high school annual that explains what he was like as a schoolboy: ""Best of luck in the future and don't be so shy."" That was the way Adam had been from day one — the youngest and smallest kid in his grade, the quietest, the most introverted, painfully shy. In his prep class photo, impossibly tiny, he hides his face behind his hands. In 1972, Lyn was only a teenager when she had him, Adam's father Chas not much older. Raised in England, not long relocated to Australia and married in a rush, Lyn was undaunted. ""I just melted,"" she says of her first glimpse of Adam. As he progressed from placid baby to timid primary schooler, the two things that mattered most to Adam were common obsessions for boys of the late 1970s: music and footy. The first was fait accompli. In utero, Adam felt the vibrations of Led Zeppelin's infamous Kooyong gig. In working-class Williamstown, the family lived above a record shop. In the backyard, musician Chas ran a recording studio graced by Daddy Cool, The Models and a procession of intriguing characters. Lyn has a photo album for every year of Adam's life. In the toddler era, guitars, amplifiers and records are the cherubic blond's constant companions. Four years later, his little brother arrives. Chas buys them Essendon footy jumpers and they join him in abandoning the family tradition: grandfather Charlie Kneale was Footscray to the bone, a Doggies stalwart for life. Adam can't remember exactly how it came about, but Footscray and Fitzroy legend Bernie Quinlan taught him how to kick a torpedo. He has clearer memories of learning the ropes as a guitarist: Daddy Cool's Ross Hannaford showed him how to play Eagle Rock. Those two crucial strands of Adam's life are glimpsed in a black and white photo from the late 1970s. With Chas's studio behind him, Adam leans back and launches his footy into the air — a dreamy image of carefree times. In it, Lyn can now see the boy she was soon to lose. Williamstown had given her sons memories they still cherish, but by the beginning of 1984 — the year Adam would turn 12 — Lyn's career as a computer programmer was taking off and she didn't think it was safe or responsible to keep renting a drop-in centre for vagabond artists. That was how and why the Kneale's ended up in Chas's home town of West Footscray — safety, the security of affordable home ownership and the promise of a grown-up life in a quieter, more traditionally suburban setting. Or so they thought. Adam fixated on the most obvious attraction of his new neighbourhood: it was a footy town and league football matches were now walking distance from home. As the family settled into its new surroundings in early 1984, 11-year-old Adam quickly found a new identity at the nearby Western Oval, then the home of the VFL's Footscray Football Club, now the Whitten Oval, home of the AFL and AFLW's Western Bulldogs. If footy ran second to music among Kneale family preoccupations, it was a close race. ""Football was big in our family,"" Adam says. ""Footscray was everything with my grandfather. Ted Whitten lived near them. He'd tell me about Ted giving his wife flowers before he headed to the footy."" For Lyn, it seemed a wholesome place for a boy to spend Saturday afternoons. For Chas, born and raised in the area, a few beers behind the goals was the perfect way of catching up with mates. ""We were Essendon supporters, but in a sense we were football supporters,"" Adam says. ""The Western Oval was the local ground, so you went there to watch the game. We went to see Simon Beasley and Doug Hawkins and all those fantastic players."" Armed with Quinlan's torpedo tips, Adam could kick as well as any boy in the area, but in other crucial facets of playing the game he struggled, rarely venturing too far from the bench in stints with local junior teams Yarraville and West Footscray. ""He was the last picked, and I could see that happening,"" Lyn says. Wary that Adam was also being bullied at school, fearful he'd lose the social capital offered by sport, she enrolled him in Judo classes to build his self-esteem. Therefore, Lyn was relieved when Adam returned home one afternoon and said he'd been offered a job as water boy at the Footscray Football Club. ""I thought that's great — he loves footy, his dad loved Footscray as his second team, and it was an after-school activity that didn't conflict with Judo,"" she says. Only now do the problems stand out: Lyn and Chas knew nothing of the person who'd offered Adam the role, nor that the job, as Adam stated, did not even exist. It would be a decade before they found out the real reason their son spent so many days and evenings at the Western Oval. And they would never so much as glimpse the man whose crimes have plagued their son's life. Back then, Adam knew him only as 'Chops', a grubby-looking, pot-bellied 40-something wearing a thick blue raincoat that smelled of cigarettes. Adam quickly established that he worked for the Bulldogs — doing what, he wasn't sure, but Chops always carried around vast sums of cash, had unhindered access to all areas of the club's offices, including the safe, and everybody at Footscray seemed to know his name. It was at the urging of a schoolmate with whom Adam had been wagging school that he first met Chops. ""My mate recruited me,"" Adam says. ""That's the only way I can put it."" One game-day in April of 1984, the boy told Adam that if he slipped away from his father's side, walked to the other end of the ground and saw 'Chops' standing at the top of a staircase to the Western Oval's John Gent Stand, he could wander up and be granted a few precious commodities: money to buy lunch, as many tickets to the footy as he wanted, and maybe season passes too. They were promises too enticing for an 11-year-old boy to ignore. On January 28, 1993, in a gruesome, 5500-word written statement to police at North Altona — the document whose contents he has never discussed with his mother — Adam began his story with the sort of understatement that remains his hallmark: ""From the time I was 12 years old I had a problem with a man who I had met in Footscray."" It outlined the next stages plainly. 'Chops' had indeed given Adam as many tickets to the footy as he wanted, just as the other boy had promised. There was money as well — Adam had never held a $10 or $20 note before, but Chops was soon handing them over in endless instalments. There was a certain prestige, too. Wandering through the inner sanctum with a Footscray insider, a timid, starry-eyed little boy in a new and unfamiliar neighbourhood suddenly felt a part of big-time footy. But there were obvious questions Adam never said out loud: why was Chops so keen to get him inside the Bulldogs clubrooms while the game was on? And why did the man never seem interested in watching the game? In his early journeys through Footscray's inner sanctum, Adam thought he would receive a brand new Sherrin football. Instead, Chops wedged him behind a cupboard door that blocked the view of anyone who might approach and began sexually molesting him. That routine was repeated at several home games early in 1984 and for years after — assaults that would last as long as the man felt he could get away with it. In Round 10 of 1984, for instance, as Bulldogs hero Beasley intercepted Graeme Allen's infamously errant pass out of defence and sunk Collingwood with the final kick of the day, Adam spent a portion of his 12th birthday being sexually abused. But that, he would soon learn, was merely the grooming phase. The worst of it began as June wore on. Apparently undetected as he repeatedly walked Adam through the Footscray offices and social club on game days, Chops became bolder and more depraved. The 'first time' is still burned into Adam's mind: the sight of Chops carrying bags of money to the Bulldogs safe; their winding journey around the club before Chops guided him into the toilets beside a function room, locking the door behind them; the sudden exposure Adam felt as he was pushed towards the sink and stripped of his pants; the mirrored reflection of Chops casually retrieving a tube of lubricant from his pocket; the ensuing sodomy, in which, Adam later told police, his assailant ""just kept forcing it in"". In the corresponding section of Adam's police statement, what chills most is the dispassionate, unadorned sentence that explains what happened in the moments after he was raped for the first time at the Footscray football club: ""Chops gave me about $10 and I went outside to watch the football."" By the closing stages of the 1984 VFL season, Footscray in its first campaign under Mick Malthouse was headed for the same result as a year earlier — seventh place, just out of finals contention. But unlike previous seasons, good times seemed near. In the preceding months, Adam had become a fixture at the club, but not as his parents envisaged. His 'water boy' duties were to turn up at the Western Oval training sessions of the club's Under-19s — the team Chops seemed most heavily invested in — and be sexually assaulted in any free room his abuser could find. On game days, the pattern of Adam's weekends for years ahead took shape: up the steps of the John Gent Stand, money in his hand and a trip behind closed doors, where he'd be manoeuvred around like a rag doll, responding to endless sexual demands. He recalls fixing his gaze on a decommissioned pie warmer as he was assaulted in semi-darkness. Another time it happened behind a bar. ""If he could only get oral satisfaction from me, that's what he'd put up with,"" Adam says. ""He could almost hover around anywhere and do that, especially when the game was on — before half-time or after half-time."" Only with the benefit of hindsight can Adam see the traits that made him such easy prey — the insecurity and defencelessness he projected as a small, shy boy in an unfamiliar place, his lack of friends, the general sense he was isolated and adrift in the world. His abuser wheedled out other telling details: Adam's eagerness for money, his truancy from a tough new school, news that Lyn and Chas's marriage was faltering, that by 1986 Chas had moved out, and soon, amid the worst of his abuse, Adam's enthusiasm for drugs that helped him disassociate. ""I was the example of what they look for,"" Adam says. ""I was the blueprint."" The final round of the 1984 season was a magical Saturday afternoon for most young footy fans: Adam's hero Terry Daniher, whose number five adorned his Bombers guernsey, kicked four out of 27 goals, setting the club's premiership September in motion; at the Junction Oval, Quinlan kicked his 100th goal of the season to clinch Fitzroy's finals spot; Leigh Matthews and Warwick Capper kicked bags for their respective teams. All of it was shown that night on the Seven network's two-hour 'Big League' highlights show, known among fans in those days as 'the replay'. Footscray was away in the hostile territory of Collingwood's Victoria Park that day, so Adam didn't attend. But Chops assured him they could grab some dinner and watch the replay together. That night — the evening of September 1, 1984 — Adam stepped into a taxi with a man whose name he didn't know and headed for Footscray's Palms Motel, a low budget motor inn whose modernist facade did not disguise its dingy atmosphere and seedy clientele. Escorted into a second-floor room, Melbourne's County Court later heard, Adam was fed by his companion and watched TV — the replay started with a half-hour recap of the Bulldogs's 43-point loss to the Pies. It was probably as Peter Landy read the final rites of Footscray's season that Adam was ordered towards the room's shower, told to strip off his clothes and bathe with his abuser. Who knows whether the TV was still on when they reached the bed, where Chops pushed Adam onto his stomach and commenced the sodomy that ""hurt like fury"". And what on earth could have been going on in Adam's head as the crime reached its conclusion, leading him to remark in his statement: ""I'm not sure if he stopped because he had ejaculated or because he was hurting me."" Only years later did Adam realise this was simply ""the next phase"". He was being conditioned to abuse outside the Footscray Football Club. Chops was ensuring he wouldn't lose Adam over the summer, when there were fewer plausible reasons for a 40-something man to meet a 12-year-old boy at the Western Oval. On the rare occasions he's felt compelled to tell his story since — to police, to employers who required an explanation for his mood swings, now to the world — Adam has always flinched at the prospect of the listener's incredulity. He understands the obvious question: why would you turn up and subject yourself to such horrors? He sees now that he'd developed an ""unhealthy"" relationship with money, but it was not about the cash. More compelling was the confusing mixture of guilt, trauma and shame, and the fear he held of being ""found out"" and exposed. Like so many victims of childhood abuse, Adam had been convinced by his abuser that only he was at fault, a dilemma that silenced him. He also recalls what he refers to as ""the freeze"" — he can still feel it, but he can't quite explain it. ""You know what's going on, but you just freeze in that moment,"" he says. ""You're in a trap, but you ignore it. I have an adult mind now. But that young kid's mind — how did it work? I can't relate to that now. It's gone."" It remains his greatest barrier to feeling believed: ""Everyone thinks with their adult rationality,” he says. “That doesn't work."" It was not until May of 1994, his nerves shredded as he sat in court, that Adam confirmed the identity of the man who destroyed his life. Graeme Barry Hobbs was indeed 40-something when Adam first approached him for footy tickets and lunch money, and was indeed heavily involved in fundraising activities at the Footscray Football Club. Hobbs had also been a senior technical officer with the Defence Department in Maribyrnong, testing ammunition and explosives for the Navy. Among the more pathetic details to emerge in court was that for his entire campaign of abuse against Adam, Hobbs was still living with his parents in his childhood home in Maidstone, also conveniently close to the Western Oval. Upon his death, aged 63 in 2009, Hobbs was recalled fondly in a short newspaper tribute, described by family as a loving brother and son. Fifteen years earlier, on the front page of The Western Times, a local newspaperman described him in a far less flattering light, as a child abuser who ""used his position at the Footscray Football Club to lure a young boy into a web of sex"". The article went on: ""The court was told that Hobbs was a single man whose passion through life had been the Footscray Football Club. He had been involved in various positions at the club, including that of chairman of fundraising."" ""When police raided his home on February 9, 1993, they discovered 39 Footscray Football Club membership cards and 14 Footscray Football Club membership medallions. Prosecutor Ms Francine McNiff said the Crown would suggest that these items were used by Hobbs to cultivate boys."" The emphasis there was on the plural — 'boys'. Although the prosecution case was built on the stories of two victims, police had gathered evidence confirming Hobbs had abused many more boys. The court did not consider another obvious possibility — backed by Adam's account of Hobbs's regular journeys to and from the club safe and his gifting to Adam of hessian money bags and an unbroken cardboard roll of coins meant for the cash float — that at a time when Footscray's finances were flatlining, Hobbs was embezzling the money he was giving Adam and other victims. It was also not for the court to ponder how such an unseemly character had avoided the detection of Footscray's administrative and management staff, because Hobbs's roles at Footscray went beyond just fundraising activities, for which he is acknowledged several times in club annual reports of the 1980s. He was also a stalwart of the club's Under-19s program, credited in annual reports as late as 1991 as the team's ""room steward"". According to Adam, Hobbs was more accurately described in the 1987 and 1988 reports, which listed him as Footscray's ""Jack of all trades"". In his police statement, Adam was unequivocal on Hobbs's status at Footscray: ""He was very popular because whoever you spoke to knew who he was."" Now, Adam and his family can't understand how nobody sensed something amiss. ""Because of all of the meetings we had during the week, whether it was on Monday or Wednesday, or senior training nights as well, we'd be out the front of the main entrance to the office, with the big bulldog on the roof,"" Adam says. ""There was an audacity to it. He'd walk me through the offices. He introduced me to the secretary. It was completely open. It was just blatant. It was like there were no consequences. ""The players were walking in and out, saying hi to him. Other people from within the club, in suits and dresses, would all say hello. People were walking in and out of the club, seeing this old guy chatting to a young boy. It would have looked a bit suspicious, you would think. ""I know there were a couple of times where he nearly got caught."" And how could it go on for so long? All told, Adam says, Hobbs raped and abused him on Footscray's premises for seven years, from 1984 to 1990. He can think of only one way of contextualising it: ""It went on longer than some of the players' careers."" Already, you might be at the point that most people reach when confronted with a story like Adam's. You probably don't want to read another word. Like many survivors, Adam can intuit this moment's arrival — when people switch off and can't stand any more. An indignity common to survivors is to feel a drain on those around them. 'How much more can this person take?' they silently ask themselves. Telling strangers comes with different burdens — not just the risk of feeling society's cold shoulder, but the likelihood of stirring up the cliches about sexual abuse that are embedded in popular culture. Like 'how could the victim of such monsters not become a monster himself?' When Adam first told his story in full, in his police statement, those anxieties and others played heavily on his mind. The result is obvious to him now: he made a partial disclosure, offering only representative examples of his abuse, skipping giant chunks of his story, couching his horrific and abnormal experiences in terms that made it easier for the person on the other side of the table. ""It took 12 hours and I was shutting off,"" he says. ""To take the pressure off myself, I made it sound like there were periods of time where nothing happened. And that's rubbish. That is just the humiliation and the shame of going through that with a stranger who I'd only met a few hours before."" In fact, he scrapped almost half his story. Not long removed from the homophobic barbs of his schoolyard, Adam ended the statement in 1987, when he'd turned 15. It meant he could avoid explaining how he was still being abused three years later, in early adulthood. Sadly, certain interactions of the ensuing years have vindicated his decision. People have read his statement and not believed that one person could endure so many assaults. What might they have said if he'd included the stomach-turning rest? Consider 1985 and 1986 alone. They did indeed prove to be highlight-filled times for Bulldogs fans. The club was two kicks away from the grand final in '85. In his first season with Footscray, Brad Hardie won the Brownlow, and Beasley the Coleman, with a cherished century of goals. They were not such fun times for Adam. Having drugged, degraded and paid the boy for his silence, Hobbs began offering him around to his ""friends"" — the paedophile ring who would make Adam's life a living hell for years to come. There was 'Steve', who abused Adam in a grimy hotel somewhere in the western suburbs, with Hobbs first observing and then joining in, sodomising Adam as Steve put his clothes back on, left the room without looking back and drove away in a white Kingswood. His abusers had told him ""everything would be alright"". Adam feared otherwise. ""I didn't want to get hurt by them,"" he told police. There was the unnamed 60-something in a house in Flemington, at which Hobbs tranquillised Adam with Rohypnol, dressed him in women's underwear and photographed him — child pornography later seized in a raid of Hobbs's parents' house, but not before it had spread through the abuse network. There was 'Noel', another 40-something who would sit around watching football until Hobbs ferried Adam to the house in Moonee Ponds where, periodically between 1986 and 1988, both men would repeatedly subject the teenager to painful penetrations. Of that, Adam told police: ""Noel was very rough with me. He knew it hurt but it didn't worry him, he just kept going."" Adam recalls his sheer hopelessness, his feeling of being ""frightened shitless"". ""But there was a resignation that it was going to happen and that I couldn't avoid it any longer,"" he says. And it was grimly repetitive. If Footscray were playing at home, Hobbs would abuse him at the Western Oval or occasionally the Palms Motel, under increasingly heavy sedation. On 'away' game weekends, he was taken to Noel's house, where anything could happen. An example was Round 10 of the 1988 season. On Saturday afternoon, reigning premiers Carlton defeated Footscray by 21 points at the Western Oval. On Sunday, as another game played on TV, Adam spent his 16th birthday being abused by Noel's girlfriend. About Noel, Hobbs had the temerity to moralise, telling Adam he was a ""dangerous"" man who would one day be caught, because he was ""not very nice"" and ""preferred younger people that were under 10 years of age"". In reality, both men were prolific and indiscriminate abusers, forever in debt to each other. ""There was this circle of handing boys around to other people,"" Adam says. ""One would get a boy, and he'd be shared throughout the group."" For Adam, that is where the faces and degradations start blurring together. ""There were a lot of [abusers] who I just didn't know who they were,"" he says. ""I'd be told 'this person is a good person'. I'd be taken into a hotel room and have to show on Hobbs what I could do for them. And then it was their turn. ""Sometimes I'd be taken to a house and there would be a gathering and they'd all bring their best boy, and it was just a swap meet."" Scariest of all was when Hobbs applied pressure to set up a meeting with Adam's younger brother. That danger was reinforced when Hobbs showed up at the Kneale household and abused Adam in his bedroom, until then one of the few unsullied spaces in his life. ""I was afraid for my brother,"" Adam says. ""I always protected him. I just couldn't have handled it. And it was a secret. I had to hide it from everyone."" In recent weeks, ABC Sport approached the owner of the house in Moonee Ponds, who confirmed that he sub-leased part of the property to 'Noel' at the time of Adam's abuse. ""Noel was a good man,"" he claimed. ""Sometimes he went to church with me."" Victoria Police's Delta task force is a mostly forgotten story of Melbourne policing history. Operating between 1982 and 1985, its groundbreaking attempt to police child exploitation was scrapped soon after its highest profile case was thrown out of court. Among Delta's documentary relics presented during the Royal Commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, there is a list drawn up by Neil Comrie, then Delta's leader, later Victoria's Commissioner of Police. Under the subject line ""Trends in sexual offences against children"", Comrie collated the key attributes to identify victims of abuse. The 12-point list remains a useful resource for parents. With the benefit of hindsight, it also serves as a biography of Adam Kneale in the 1980s: Of course, Adam was in the age bracket. He was often unsupervised, too. By 1986, a long time coming, Chas and Lyn's divorce was formalised. The Kneale boys became ""latchkey kids"" whose high-achieving mother worked two jobs to keep them fed, clothed and happy. Moods? Lyn recalls her strong sense in the ensuing years of ""losing my little boy"" — Adam's inexplicable aggression, the banging of pots and pans, his constant scheming and lying, the calls about his absences from school. ""That's when I was probably the angriest with him, just saying 'tell me what's going on',"" Lyn says. ""Why are you so glum? Where have you been? What have you been doing? He'd say 'just at the football club'. He couldn't describe why he was angry. Or he wouldn't. ""He was irrational. You could see he was frustrated. But I couldn't draw it out from him."" Morals? In the grip of Hobbs's manipulation and abuse, Adam's were entirely warped. Seeking attention? Hobbs, Adam says, ""had a sixth sense for kids who were desperate for attention"" and picked his mark perfectly. Rewards and approval? Adam became obsessed with money — getting it from Hobbs and spending it. Thus a childhood album overflowing with ticket stubs from expensive rock concerts — Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon's Graceland tour. Thus the fancy presents Adam lavished on loved ones at birthday, Easter and Christmas times. School? Tottenham Tech was a decrepit wasteland, violent and unruly, plagued by staffing shortages and soon to be shuttered. A mute, often absent student like Adam was unlikely to command any attention at all, let alone raise alarm bells. And it is hard to believe the school would have saved Adam had it known. The year his abuse began, a recently-hired Tottenham Tech teacher prompted a media firestorm by pledging public support for an organisation called The Australian Paedophile Support Group, among whose aims was to lower the age of consent to 10. It was the unsuccessful charges that stemmed from a raid on one of its meetings that torpedoed the Delta Task Force. Recreation centres? Inordinate time in the company of adults? The Western Oval was Adam's second home, Hobbs his constant companion, Adam's peers were not even invited around for his birthdays. Withdrawn from family? Without even seeing the list, Lyn offers a summary of Adam's mid-teens: ""He was withdrawing from the family circle."" Her mother's intuition suggested Adam was wrestling with his sexuality. ""Of course, he said, 'I wouldn't know what you're talking about, Mum'. I said 'Please talk to me. Tell me what's going on.' We talked about bullying and grooming. Adam was blankfaced and said, 'No, no way, nothing like that is happening.' And it was,"" she says. An example of the parallel realities of mother and son was Adam's trip to Sydney in 1987, to watch the Bulldogs playing against the Swans. ""I remember him phoning me up and saying, 'Mum, would you let me go on a trip to Sydney with the Footscray Football Club?',"" Lyn says. ""I said 'who is organising it? Who is in charge? How long is it for?' ""A guy was put on the phone. I don't know what name he gave me, but he said it was for the young kids who'd been helping out as well as the young players, and they were going up there in a bus. He said it'd be a fun experience for him to see an interstate game. 'We'll take good care of him.' I thought that meant they'd make sure he didn't get drunk. ""But little did I know what was going on."" The man, of course, was Graeme Hobbs. For much of the ride to Sydney, in a bus chartered for the Bulldogs party, he placed his grubby blue jacket over their laps and molested Adam, handing him $100 on arrival and instructions on when to meet at a hotel room. Spooked by the sum — more than he'd ever received in one hit — Adam listened to his instincts and walked the streets of King's Cross all night instead. On game day, the Bulldogs were thumped by 108 points. But Hobbs's wandering hands were small fry in Adam's list of problems by that point. The secret he was keeping from his family was very far from the quiet suburban adolescence his parents wanted for him. By 1987, his life was barely distinguishable from that of a child sex slave. Only years latter could Adam fully appreciate that the most dangerous person he encountered amid the degradations and terror of his childhood was not Graeme Hobbs, but a man he only knew as 'John'. Adam's ""far too many"" meetings with John took place at a one-bedroom apartment in Essendon. Hobbs told Adam it was John's home, but it was so devoid of furnishings and signs of habitation that the teenager immediately suspected it was more likely the clubhouse of the paedophile ring that had claimed him. For one thing, Hobbs had a key, a courtesy not extended by 'Noel'. For another, Adam later found out, the house John shared with his wife and children was in nearby Glenroy. It explained why he was always in a hurry to leave. His name really was John, it turned out — John Raymond Wayland. In 1996, Justice Higgins of Melbourne's County Court jailed the 53-year-old for 16 years, describing his depraved sex offending as the worst case of child abuse he'd encountered in any court. Wayland used his contacts in junior sporting clubs and the proximity of his house to a local school to abuse children during their lunch breaks — opportunistic and sickening attacks that included penetration with cutlery, vegetables and sauce bottles, and orders for the children to perform sex acts on each other. After life-altering ordeals that left them with lacerations and internal injuries, the children were told by Wayland that if they spoke of their abuse, they would end up in jail. That Wayland didn't receive a far longer sentence of his own was only down to the fact that ""unlawful indecent assault"" — sexual acts not including penetration — was the only charge available at the time. Thus, not one of Wayland's many brutal acts of penetration could be charged, the court heard, ""because of the existence of time limits which require proceedings to be instituted within 12 months of the commission of the offences"". Newspaper reports carried prosecutor Frank Gucciardo's descriptions of Wayland as ""the ringleader of a group of men who sexually abused young boys and girls"", part of a ""larger systematic pattern of criminality"". Adam could certainly attest to that, too. In one visit to Wayland's apartment, he says he was abused by four men at once, a memory he finds almost impossible to verbalise. Another time, Wayland raped him for 10 minutes as Hobbs ate Kentucky Fried Chicken in the next room. Telling the latter story to police, Adam signed off with another of his plain-spoken, heartbreaking laments: ""I never wanted to have sex with any of these people."" These days, Wayland — once described as ""so likely to commit further sexual offences that you constitute a danger to the community"" — lives in north-western Victoria, within walking distance of four schools. Approached for comment by ABC Sport, Wayland said he has served his time and reformed his character. He claimed no memory of Adam Kneale. Asked to explain his association with Graeme Hobbs, Wayland claimed to have met Hobbs only twice. The second time, Wayland said, was at Pentridge, where both men were incarcerated. The first was when Wayland was briefly a trainer at a football club in which Hobbs was also involved — the Footscray Football Club. Adam now sees his life as a series of seven-year cycles. The first was the period of his abuse. Before the next commenced, aged only 20, he somehow found the courage to report his abusers. He'd been unravelling for three months, since the day of his daughter's birth. The arrival of a first child is daunting for any parent. For Adam it was almost lethal. In photos, he now sees himself having ""the nervous breakdown that I didn't recover from"". The other trigger occurred a year earlier. At 19, Adam assumed he was too old for his abuser, but Hobbs resumed contact with an equally sinister purpose. He wanted Adam to join his circle of offenders. ""You just have that feeling that if you don't want it to happen again, you've got to do something about it,"" Adam says. Little wonder workplace car parks became the scene of future breakdowns. Adam's first — the worst — occurred on the morning of January 28, 1993. Overwhelmed by tears, he found a phone and called police. ""I started the statement at three o'clock in the afternoon and I was still there at three in the morning,"" he says. ""It was an out-of-body experience. I look back on that time and think: How did I move? How did I function? How did I get through it?"" In truth, his coping mechanisms were unhealthy. Most survivors realise only with hindsight how susceptible they were to the worst-case outcomes of childhood sexual abuse — mental illness, drug and alcohol addiction, violence, crime, suicide. To his lifelong regret, from the age of 16 and until his report to police, with both the mother of his daughter and in a previous relationship, Adam's anger became violence. ""I just turned into the person I was afraid of — people who'd pick on the weakest or quietest person,"" he says. ""You're lashing out at someone else for something else. I'll probably never get over that, just as they won't. I understand why it happened, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it did, and I still have to live with that."" Fearful of hurting anyone else, feeling unworthy of love, he would stay single for a decade. Eleven days after Adam's statement, Hobbs was arrested and charged. Another survivor came forward. Hobbs confessed, but his sentencing hinged mostly on Adam's evidence. Other burdens swamped Adam. Police pointed out the obvious: none of the men who'd abused him wore condoms, so he'd need to commence AIDS testing, checking in every six months. ""It was horrific,"" he says of the lonely nights he spent pondering his fate. ""But it was piled onto the horrific things I was already dealing with — the court case, the therapy, the doctors, the first raids of early computers with child pornography. It was all one big mass of trouble at the time."" He doesn't recall turning 21. Not wanting to pry, friends and family assumed he was part of a class action, not the linchpin of the case. A lawyer's promise of free psychiatric care for life evaporated. Inevitably, the court process was a crushing disappointment too, so Adam chose to delude himself. For years afterwards, he clung to a lie that Hobbs had faced 99 charges and been imprisoned for 13 years, the full force of the justice system coming down on him. The reality was far less emphatic: 13 counts of indecent assault, two of unlawful possession of Footscray Football Club tickets and medallions, one of buggery, one of possessing child pornography. As would occur in Wayland's case, acts of penetration committed more than 12 months before the investigation sat outside the statute of limitations, and Hobbs's early admission of guilt meant a large cache of photographs he had taken of his many victims was not presented in court. His 39-month sentence for destroying Adam's life came with a minimum of just 15 months. Two years later, Adam clipped a newspaper story of John Wayland's conviction and sighed relief, but having directed investigators to numerous hotels and the house in Moonee Ponds, he never found out if 'Noel' or others had faced justice. In 1989, when Hobbs was still abusing and paying off Adam on the Footscray Football Club's premises, the Bulldogs had only survived extinction thanks to the Fightback campaign, led by famed Melbourne lawyer Peter Gordon, who in the process rose to the club's presidency. Adam's fightback campaign was longer and far more arduous — another seven-year cycle that stretched from Hobbs's sentencing in May of 1994 until 2000. In this phase, his paltry victims-of-crime compensation payout did not last long. With 50 per cent custody of his daughter, he needed to pull himself together while living on medical benefits and charity, balancing his own psychiatric care with the needs of his child. How did he pull himself back from the brink? At a time when male survivors of sexual abuse were actively excluded from support services with feminist foundations, he located what seemed the only male-run one — the Against Male Assault Network — and threw himself into their programs, completing certificate qualifications to help other survivors. He thought music could heal him too, so put a band together. A few frazzled, knock-kneed performances later, ""frightened shitless"", he realised his childhood dream was over, right as his brother found a niche in Melbourne's indie music scene. ""We were a very musical family,"" Adam says. ""I should have been able to do something with it, but trauma just destroyed it."" Parenting became his number one priority. ""My daughter was my anchor,"" he says. ""She inspired me. I wanted to be an example for her, that you've got to stand up and fight for yourself."" But even that presented problems. Adam now rues how much trauma she was exposed to as he tried to find help. As 2000 progressed, two decisions — one his own, one someone else's — would shape the next 20 years of Adam's life. The first was out of his hands. Summoned to a Centrelink office, he was assessed as capable of returning to full-time work. Part of him genuinely accepted it — he wanted to be a role model and felt increasingly judged when loved ones mentioned his longstanding welfare dependency. But a few years removed from the 20-year treadmill he stepped onto, Adam now sees what he could not at the time. ""I was never fit for work,"" he says. ""There is no way in hell they would do that now."" The other big decision was his own. After seven years of intensive treatment, he felt he'd ""graduated"" from the program of therapy that had been a major personal focus. ""I came to an agreement with my psychologist that my time was done, but they didn't know what I had,"" he says. ""There was a long list — anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, it went on. All those things are now under four letters — PTSD. I've had it since I was a teenager."" Among the more puzzling outcomes of Graeme Hobbs's conviction for Adam's abuse, a pair of non-events particularly stand out. The first was the averted gaze of the media when the horrifying scale of Hobbs's offending became a series of reportable facts. In a city where football is religion, at a time when child sexual abuse had been removed from the too-hard basket and given front-page prominence by well-resourced major newspapers, Adam's story was almost nowhere to be seen. Just how was it, he now wonders, that a parochial suburban paper like The Western Times — edited then by a Footscray football club board member, no less — was the only media outlet to report on an AFL club playing host to such a stupefying case of child abuse? The second was Footscray Football Club's failure to publicly acknowledge Adam's story — no statement, no expression of regret, not so much as a notation in its annual report. There was no private apology, either. For Adam, that was and remains particularly galling. The club's president at the time was Peter Gordon, a cousin of Adam's father Chas. ""The Kneales and the Gordons all used to live within a block in West Footscray,"" Adam says. ""To see people like Peter Gordon and to think that … I couldn't stand the club. I couldn't stand to go past the place. Even now, I wouldn't even venture into the western suburbs. There is just too much disappointment associated with that club. To me, now, it is just a cesspit."" He was gladder than anyone when the club changed its name to the Western Bulldogs, because ""any mention of Footscray was just a trigger-and-a-half"". In a written response to questions from ABC Sport, Peter Gordon said he had no recollection of Adam's story and ""no knowledge of any interaction the club may have had with Adam nor any offer of assistance"". ""Until this week, I was unaware my cousin Charles Kneale had a son named Adam, and I have no recollection of hearing of Adam or what you have described,"" Gordon wrote. ""I also know nothing of Graeme Hobbs or the nature of his relationship with the club. But I'm glad he was charged and convicted and I hope he got a fitting sentence."" Gordon said the Kneale and Gordon families had been estranged for as long as he could remember, but that he had ""a vague recollection of Charles writing a letter addressed to me care of the club during the October 1989 fightback campaign with a cassette of a song he had recorded about the club that he thought we could publish to make money"". ""But I have no other memory of that family,"" he wrote. Gordon added that for most of 1993, 1994 and 1995, he was in Western Australia taking statements and initiating litigation on behalf of 320 men who'd been abused in Christian Brothers institutions, so had ""some idea of the profound and lifelong trauma such abuse inflicts"". Dennis Galimberti, who was Footscray's chief executive for a decade between late 1986 and late 1996, told ABC Sport the club was unaware of Adam's abuse at the time it occurred. ""It may have been on the front page of the Western Times, which I've got no recollection of whatsoever, but we didn't know these offences had occurred at the club,"" Galimberti says. Galimberti recalls seeing Hobbs around at the club but said Footscray had no knowledge of any wrongdoing by Hobbs until 1992. That year, Graeme Pearce was elevated to the chief executive position and Galimberti demoted to second-in-charge, an arrangement that lasted only six months until Galimberti resumed the top job. ""I remember that Pearce came to me one day in 1992 and said that he'd received a complaint from someone,"" Galimberti says. ""He didn't tell me who the complaint was from. He told me he received a complaint from someone that related to Hobbs giving away membership tickets to attract young children and youth to the club. ""He said he was going to handle the complaint. Sometime later, when he hadn't given me any update on what was happening with the complaint, I spoke to him and said, 'What have you done about the complaint with Hobbs?'. And he said, 'Don't worry about it, I've rung Hobbs and told him he's not to set foot in the club again'. And I never saw Hobbs after that."" Asked how Hobbs was able to gain such wide-ranging access to the club's inner sanctum, Galimberti said Hobbs would not have had a key, but ""the offices might have been open"". ""On match days, the offices were manned by staff,"" Galimberti says. ""There are people coming in and out. There are people attending gates, collecting money, money would be delivered to the office and put in the safe. You wouldn't necessarily need a key, because there is someone in the offices during match days and the office is open for enquiries from the public and for all sorts of reasons. ""He would have had access to the offices but I'm pretty much 100 per cent satisfied that he wouldn't have had a key. We were very heavily dependent on volunteers and people giving up their time to do various jobs, because we couldn't afford to pay people to do it. But there wasn't the checks and balances in those days. There was no working with children checks. ""When you're working with volunteers, it's very difficult because there is no job description. There is no hierarchy in terms of management. There is no payment for their services. So it can be very loose. Back in those days, it was probably very loose — looser than it would be now."" Galimberti said neither he nor any other club officials were questioned by police during the investigation that led to Hobbs's arrest. ""I'm a solicitor and I was a solicitor then,"" Galimberti says. ""If anything like this arose, I would have been made aware of it. If there was a formal investigation and people had to be interviewed, I would have been aware of it."" Galimberti said he ""didn't know why"" the matter was never brought to the attention of the club's board by Graeme Pearce. By the late 1980s, Footscray's finances might have been strained, but even then, the Bulldogs positioned themselves as a community-minded club with a particular focus on child welfare. In 1989 and 1990, when Adam was still being abused at the club, Foostcray launched the Care For Kids program among the initiatives of its Bulldogs Foundation. At the time, Galimberti said it would ""provide leadership, guidance and activities designed to make a difference in the lives of children in the west"". Players acted as ""big brothers"" to troubled local teens, delivering presentations at local schools, preaching the club's values. Care For Kids stickers and T-shirts could be seen all around town. At the time, famed local welfare worker Les Twentyman, also a cousin of Peter Gordon, called it ""a long-term program which could have exciting and positive outcomes"", which in time included $2,000 grants for local schools thanks to one of the program's sponsors, Kemcor. Indeed, documents held at Melbourne's Public Record Office confirm the participation of Adam's school, Tottenham Tech. Adam's mother Lyn now scoffs at the concept. ""Understanding what Adam endured in those club rooms and under the eyes of people higher up than the abusers, I don't trust them,"" she says. ""How could they not have known? They encouraged this person and had him coordinating money. ""They put themselves up on a pedestal, football clubs. But there were no checks. Adam fell through the gaps. A person I know and love has had this happen to them. This has happened in other clubs. It's happened to other children."" For the first time in hours discussing Adam, the gravity of his suffering brings on tears, reducing Lyn to a forlorn whisper: ""They stole his life."" Nobody is more acutely aware of Adam's battle than his wife Natasha, who lives every day with the aftershocks of his abuse. They met in 1996, living in the same apartment block in Elwood. ""I was just awed"", Natasha remembers. She also recognised their shared life experiences — shyness, insecurity, childhood traumas — and felt instantly they would be together one day. ""We were both very broken,"" she says. ""We needed comfort. But it couldn't be any more at that time."" Adam was honest about his anger and the fear he would destroy the relationship before it began. Like Adam, Tash had been bullied from primary school until early adulthood. She's always held a lot inside. Adam describes her as a listener and an endless giver whose first priority is always the happiness and comfort of others. She can't stand seeing anyone excluded. But life was tough in the 10 years before it was ""the right time"" for them, and tougher still in their first year together. ""It probably aged me 10 years,"" Natasha says. Quickly married and pregnant with their son, she was swamped by the added responsibility of caring for someone whose mental health was so fragile. ""We were trying to find him medication that worked,"" she says. ""I felt like I was on eggshells the whole time. It was just so easy to trigger something. I didn't realise how hard it was going to be."" The arrival of their son saved the relationship, ushering in a five-year period in which they ""healed each other"" and ""learned how to be a couple"", slowly and sometimes painfully navigating a more positive course. Motherhood brought Natasha brightness and joy to balance out the darkness Adam could not help but drag home. But just as one stormy era passed, and the family's move to the country heralded a simpler, better life, hostile workplaces played host to the manifestations of Adam's illness. ""He just looked heartbroken and defeated,"" Natasha says. ""He'd come home shaking. He was such a hard worker, such a good guy, such a perfectionist who took pride in his work. And it was so important to him to keep going and supporting his family."" ""But they didn't see that. They saw him as a weakness and bullied him. When he said he couldn't do it any more, I was happy."" In the last two years, Natasha's relief has come with qualifications. In the early years of the relationship, she had been outgoing, her positivity cajoling Adam along. For the last decade, Adam admits, he has been the family's ""anchor"", so plagued by anxieties that even leaving the house is an ordeal. Natasha does not blame him. His guilt upsets her. But she cannot deny her own sadness on the occasions she takes her son out, or on holidays, without Adam. ""I watch families where the mother and fathers are out with their children, and I get sad and cry,"" she says. ""I wish Adam could be there as well, sharing it with us. Even to be able to go for a walk together, the two of us, down the rail track. He's got such a great heart, and I know he wants to live life to the fullest, but I understand and accept why he can't. I know he's never going to be fully healed. ""I just wish people could see what I see. I guess they see someone who is defensive, angry, not friendly. They don't get to see his wit, his funny sense of humour, and that really caring, loyal, fierce protector he is as well. ""He says I helped him, but we both really helped each other. We make each other better, stronger, whole. He's the best guy I've ever met."" Perhaps it is the power of Natasha's love that makes Adam feel fortunate, but he might be the only person on earth who would consider him lucky. He has his family's support, he reminds himself. His children are healthy. It hurt his ego to accept charity from loved ones when his forced retirement depleted the family's finances, but they have a roof over their heads. ""I keep telling Natasha, 'I have no reason to be this depressed',"" Adam says. ""What more could I ask for?"" He's always told himself these lies of self-encouragement. He remembers the first, which rolled around his head after he was first raped by Graeme Hobbs in the Footscray Football Club toilets: ""This won't affect me when I get older."" ""It's ridiculous, isn't it?"" he says. ""I said, 'It won't affect me. I'll get the $20 or the season ticket to give to a friend or family member'."" It is fashionable now to call this mindset resilience. Resilient is an accurate descriptor of Adam but it also diminishes his suffering. Resilience, as it applies to institutional child sexual abuse, over-emphasises the individual fortitude of the survivor. The target of our admiration is obvious. But stories of resilience mitigate and distract us from the failings of the institutions where their abuse occurs, whose shortcomings can be explained away as relics of another time and place, with characters propelled by different values and contexts. The target of our scorn is less clear. ""In my head, I always thought 'I'll ride this out',"" Adam says. ""But it never ended. It's a perpetual hell and yesterday is the same as today. It just demolishes your life. You hope that today you'll sleep better."" He hasn't slept longer than three hours a night in years. To grapple with a small list of his other daily ordeals is to understand the depths of human suffering. ""My normal,"" he admits, ""is most people's worst day."" His PTSD has ""engulfed"" him, hence the trembling hands, his unsteadiness, his racing heartbeat, the anxiety attacks when strangers look at him, his sad slide into a hermit's life. He feels ""stuck"" in his childhood, his personal growth stunted. Far from moments of happiness, family birthdays, Easters, Christmases and many other milestone events are acutely painful — times Adam associates with his abuse. ""I would need money because I wanted to buy someone a present to show my appreciation or whatever, while sacrificing myself at the same time,"" he says. Gift-giving is impossible. Lyn says she has only ever received two birthday cards from Adam, a tally that surprises him. He'd prefer his upcoming 50th birthday pass without comment. ""I've had too many birthdays where I find myself upset with the situation I'm in, whether it was logical or not,"" he says. ""I know it's an anniversary every year. I have an image of walking into Noel's place and the football replay is on, or going to the hotel room and the football replay is on. ""I have more problems with it now than ever — the anniversaries, Saturday early-evenings, having my photo taken, being watched, even touching cash."" Today would have been tough whether he was telling his story or not, because the Bulldogs play Essendon — a day that should prompt fond memories of his grandfather and faraway Saturdays watching his childhood heroes. For Adam, it's one of the worst days on the calendar. When he does sleep, nightmares still overwhelm him — the abusers are the same, but they're taking him somewhere new. ""I also have dreams that I'm at work,"" he says. ""I know in the dream that I don't have to be there, but for some reason I'm there. So, why am I there? I'm there to please them. It's the same as the abuse. ""Don't ever let anyone tell you that you don't feel pain in your dreams."" Another nightmare explains what happens when a man spends his life sparing others from his pain. In it, an incision has been made on the back of Adam's wrist so that a flap of skin opens up, revealing a gory panel of blood and muscle. He responds instinctively, yanking his shirt sleeve down, holding it over the wound so nobody will see. No wonder he clings to music — listening to it, talking about it, making it. ""It's the only healing thing other than having someone by your side,"" he says. ""If it wasn't for music, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation. ""Last night, I put a few chords together, seeing how I could improvise with them. It started getting dark in my room and I had the sound of the trees outside. Today I'll forget it. But it mattered to me then. In that moment, I could switch off."" Why tell his story now? Five years ago, he wanted to share it with the royal commission but was not ready. Now, 38 years after his abuse began, he just wants it to stop controlling his life. ""I've lost a lot of years from a mental health point of view, not being able to achieve what I set out to achieve when I was a kid,"" he says. ""I'm getting close to 50 and things are going to shit again, but in a way that I never could have imagined. ""And it makes sense. A lot of the people I used to see in self-help groups were in their 40s and they were a mess. Guys who were my age now. I just thought it was because they hadn't dealt with it all those years. But it wasn't. ""Something happens to them in their 40s that makes them have to face what they're facing. For me, it was like, 'What do I have to face?'. I said to my doctor, 'I'm done with waiting until I think I'm ready'. That's like waiting to sleep properly again."" Reflecting on Adam's life, Lyn admits she is a pessimist, always pondering the worst 'what-ifs'. In her heart she hopes today is the day her son fights back and ""feels proud of his whole story"". Naturally, she also ponders the alternative: ""What if he doesn't?"" She knows there is a chasm between what she wants for Adam and what he can realistically have. She can't stop herself from comparing his life with his brother's. ""What's happened to his brother should have happened to Adam — a career, music, fun,"" she says. ""His brother lives in the country now, and he'll call and say he's broken a chainsaw. I say 'that's an incident, not a disaster'. Adam has had disaster after disaster and they're two very different things. To lose the boy when he's becoming a man is heartbreaking."" And then she ponders one final 'what-if', one she knows Adam has pondered often too: ""What if he'd never gone to the Footscray Football Club?"" Do you have more information on this story?

19,"'Trophies, medals and money don't mean as much as human connection': The philosophy of boxer Harry Garside",sport," Sport Harry Garside prepares to defend his Australian lightweight title — but his priorities go well beyond boxing Harry Garside rose to prominence after winning Australia's first Olympic boxing medal in 33 years at the Tokyo Games. It wasn't just that historic bronze, but his painted nails and passion for ballet that won over so many different fans. ""It's been pretty crazy since the Olympics last year,"" Garside said. ""I'm the type of person who tries to grab every opportunity the universe throws at me."" The 24-year-old doesn't shy away from challenges. Just one month after claiming the Australian lightweight title in his second professional bout with a unanimous decision over Manuer Matet in Sydney, Garside is gearing up for his next fight. Australian lightweight boxer Harry Garside was considered an easybeat in his early years in the fight game, but the ballet-dancing plumber from Melbourne has made quite the impression. ""It's a quick turnaround. Not many fighters are doing it these days, but I'm pretty old school with my belief and the way I train,"" he said. Having moved to 2-0 in his professional career, his next opponent is Tasmanian Layton McFerran (5-1) on May 11 at the Newcastle Entertainment Centre. ""I don't know too much about him and have struggled to find footage of him, but he's only lost one of his six fights,"" Garside said. ""He is as tough as nails and he's coming to win."" Garside's triumph over Matet was the first time he fought past three rounds. It was a test of mental endurance as much as physical, and one Garside embraces, as he dreams of one day winning a world title. ""I remember getting to round eight and thinking 'I wish I could sit down', but it felt good, and I was really excited to go 10 rounds,"" he said. ""I can't wait for world titles and boxing 12 rounds."" Garside and Nikita Tszyu are both featured on the undercard of the main event between Paul Gallen (12-1-1) and Kris Terzievski (10-1-1) on Wednesday. Tszyu (1-0), the youngest son of former world champion Kostya and brother to world-ranked Tim, will face Melbourne's Mason Smith (5-0). Former NRL star Gallen and fellow Australian heavyweight Terzievski will be aiming to create Australian boxing history, with the winner to be crowned with dual titles for the first time in more than 100 years. Garside credits Gallen for what he has done for the sport of boxing and providing young fighters like himself a platform. He said he could not wait to fight under Gallen. ""The best thing I love about Paul Gallen is what you see is what you get,"" Garside said. ""He speaks his mind, he's unapologetically Paul Gallen."" Garside has an unassuming confidence and the former plumber from Melbourne's eastern suburbs is proudest for being known as the ballet dancing boxer. The youngest of three boys, Garside wanted to do ballet and dance for many years but was too afraid to tell his dad and older brothers. ""I finally built up the courage in 2019 to start ballet and I absolutely love it,"" he said. ""It's helped my boxing heaps and one day when I'm good enough I will do a performance for sure."" While Garside can pack a pirouette as well as he does a punch, he wants to be known as more than just a boxer. Over the past two years, he has been focused on separating his boxing persona from his authentic self. ""At the end of the day, trophies, medals and money don't mean as much to me [as] human connection does,"" he said. ""At the end of my life, I want to be remembered as a good person, rather than a good boxer."" Sporting nails painted with different colours, Garside's mission to break gender stereotypes came from his own struggles and he hopes it inspires young people to embrace their quirks. ""There were so many things pushed on me when I was growing up about how I was supposed to act,"" he said. ""By painting my nails, I hope young people can see that I don't have to play the roles society pushes on me and I can be who I am."" Garside credits the Reach foundation, a youth not-for-profit organisation aimed at building social and emotional development, for giving him the courage to be comfortable in his own skin. ""They came to my school when I was 16 years old,"" he said. ""My involvement with them took me on a journey where I learnt to love myself — the good, the bad and ugly."" One of his life goals is to get combat sports integrated into the school system. While boxing may be high risk, Garside believes lower-impact versions, such as judo and jiu-jitsu, could be suitable alternatives. ""I remember as a young person going through a lot between the ages of 10 to 18 years,"" he said. ""The body is changing, there are so many emotions running through your body and you're feeling things for the first time."" Physical benefits aside, Garside said such sports could teach young people other valuable life lessons, such as discipline, respect, confidence and self-love. Attributes Garside now has an abundance of.

20,Trans women's participation in sport has been framed as an election issue. This is what some trans athletes think,sport," Sport If you've been following the federal election campaign, you'd be forgiven for thinking trans women's participation in sport is the biggest issue facing the nation. Over the past week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his controversial ""captain's pick"" for Warringah, Katherine Deves, have been drawn into an increasingly ugly debate about a private member's bill by Liberal senator Claire Chandler which seeks to ban trans women from participating in women's sport by refusing to recognise them as women. Deves, in particular, has been rebuked for a range of extremist comments, including video that has surfaced of her likening her lobbying on the issue to standing up against the Holocaust. Although Morrison has said the Coalition ""does not have any plans"" to sponsor such a bill, he has previously labelled it ""terrific"" and said he shares Deves's and Chandler's views on trans participation in sport. But while those who believe trans women should be excluded from sport have defended their right to ""free speech"", little airtime has been given to examining the science behind the claims being made. So what does the science say about trans women and sport? Associate Professor Ada Cheung is a principal research fellow in endocrinology at Austin Health and leads the Trans Health Research program in partnership with the University of Melbourne. She says medical transitions have a range of complicated impacts on the body which throw into doubt claims about trans women having a ""biological advantage"" in sport. Trans women, she says, will often start taking a form of estrogen as well as testosterone blockers to increase their estrogen and decrease their testosterone levels to a more ""typical female range"". ""When they do that, they get physical changes to their muscle and fat, so they typically gain fat and lose muscle,"" she says, citing a study she co-authored in 2021. More recent research to come out of the Trans Health Research program, she adds, shows trans women also have lower bone density than cisgender men. She refers to another study, which followed a group of trans women undergoing hormone therapy over a three-year period, and showed that their muscle mass, power and strength decreased. ""But that particular study only involved 19 women, and they didn't have an adequate control group to compare with,"" cautions Cheung. ""Transgender research is in its infancy. There's hardly any research in this space. I actually cannot say for certain whether trans women retain a physical advantage [over cisgender women] or not."" However Cheung, who also treats trans clients as a doctor, says anecdotal evidence does not support the theory trans athletes have an ""advantage"". ""My patients tell me they don't [have an advantage], my patients tell me they lose strength and can't do the physical work that they used to,"" she says. ""But I can't tell you [for certain] because the science just hasn't been done, which is what we (the researchers) are trying to fix."" On the idea that trans women might pose a safety threat to cisgender women, however, Cheung is emphatic. ""There is no data to suggest that safety [for cisgender women] is worse when trans women are competing,"" she says. Cheung says that is partly because so few trans women play sport or exercise in the first place. Focus has once again turned to the issue of transgender women in sport, leaving more significant issues unchallenged. She points to an American Human Rights Campaign study from 2017 which showed that, nationally, 68 per cent of high school students were participating in team sport. For the LGBTQI+ community, however, that number dropped to 24 per cent, while for trans women, it was as low as 12 per cent. ""They aren't participating in sport because they fear discrimination,"" Cheung says. ""You know, [they're dealing with issues like] what bathroom do I go to? What change room do I use? What uniform am I going to wear? What if they found out [I'm trans]?"" Roxy Tickle is a trans woman in her early 50s who participates in the North Coast Hockey league for the East Lismore club. She says recent public conversation about trans participation in sport has taken a toll on her mental health. ""It has been really distressing,"" she says. ""It has pushed my anxiety through the roof. I've had to increase my anti-anxiety medication to counter this."" Tickle isn't alone in this regard, with national LGBTQI+ peer support and referral hotline QLife reportedly experiencing a 53 per cent spike in calls on days with significant media coverage of Deves's transphobic views. On average, calls to the hotline have also reportedly increased by 19 per cent since the election campaign started. ""This has real-world implications for a problem that doesn't actually resonate with my lived experience,"" Tickle says. Tickle's first foray into women's sport came in 2019 when a friend asked her if she would play in the Lismore Masters in softball. Tickle had only recently transitioned but was at the time taking testosterone blockers which qualified as a banned substance. As a result, she sought information from Sport Integrity Australia (formerly ASADA) about whether she could apply for a therapeutic-use exemption to play while taking the blockers. ""It took three months to find out whether I could play,"" she says. Eventually, it was decided that because it was a standalone event and did not come under the NSW Softball or Softball Australia umbrella she could participate. ""The Masters weekend was nine games in three days or something like that, and I couldn't walk straight for about a week [afterwards],"" she says. ""Here's my advantage: I was the only one who couldn't play the last game. I couldn't run, I walked. And it took me about 10 times longer to walk across the field than it did anyone else."" Despite her fitness challenges, Tickle's experience playing softball gave her the confidence to approach a local hockey club that she had been assured was LGBTQI+ friendly. ""I went down, and I was like, 'Hi, I'm Roxy. Is it OK if I come and play?'"" Tickle anticipated further questions about her gender identity but instead a club member simply asked which grade she wanted to play in. ""I said, 'Probably the bottom one. I'm not fit, and I'm really not that good,'"" Tickle recalls. ""And she just said, 'OK, we'll find somewhere for you Roxy.' ""I burst into tears … this is what a lot of people don't understand — we spend so many years not belonging anywhere. ""I hated myself for decades, and now so many people [at the club] love me. I've found somewhere I fit, and it's just been brilliant. It's the reason I'm still here."" A number of other trans women athletes contacted by the ABC echoed these sentiments, with 17-year-old Emily, which is not her real name, saying her experience playing basketball for a Queer Sporting Alliance team had been life changing. ""Being able to participate in team sports gets me up in the morning,"" she says. ""It encourages me to exercise and eat healthily. ""It has also encouraged me to love my body, to know that we are all different. ""As a trans athlete, I am scared about not being able to participate in sport. ""Being an athlete is a core part of my identity, and without it I am unsure how I would cope."" In 2019, Merrilee Barnes worked as director of Inclusive Sport at Sport Australia, which had commissioned the Australian Human Rights Commission to draft the guidelines for the inclusion of transgender and gender-diverse people in sport, which have been endorsed by a wide range of national sporting organisations (NSOs). Those NSOs include the AFL, Cricket Australia, Football Federation Australia, NRL, Netball Australia, Rugby Australia and Tennis Australia. The underlying principle of the guidelines, as set out by sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins, is that ""participation in sport is a human right"". ""This makes it essential that everyone has the opportunity to participate in sport, regardless of their sex or gender identity,"" Jenkins writes in the foreword. As part of the process of developing the guidelines, Barnes and others undertook consultations with over 100 stakeholders — including clubs, player associations, state and territory human rights commissions, legal and medical experts, academics, and cisgender and transgender/gender diverse athletes. She said that process failed to uncover any significant concerns about trans and gender participation in sport. ""There were the odd outliers but overall they were all in support of inclusion,"" she says. ""We never had any complaints at Sport Australia. This was never presented as trans women taking over women's sport or a safety issue for women and girls."" The Coalition's Minister for Aged Care Richard Colbeck (then-sport minister) also subsequently encouraged ""all sports clubs"" to embrace the guidelines. A fact that has not received enough airtime in the current debate, Barnes says, is that the under section 42 of the sex discrimination act, sporting groups are already allowed to discriminate where ""strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant"". For example, the AFL has a gender diversity policy that requires trans women to prove that their testosterone levels are below a specific limit over a two-year period. They also have to submit a range of other data including their height, weight, bench press records and sprint times. This data in turn informs the league's decision on whether a trans or gender-diverse athlete is considered to have an ""unreasonable advantage"" over their cisgender peers. While such policies can and have been critiqued for their fairness, Barnes says they prove sports already police trans and gender-diverse participation in sport where it is deemed relevant. Barnes also points out that when trans athletes have been included in elite competition, they have far from ""dominated"". Despite being eligible for Olympic participation since 2004, only a handful of openly transgender or non-binary athletes have competed in the Games, including New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard. Hubbard, the first openly trans woman to compete, finished last in her division, failing to complete a lift. But while debate often focuses on elite competition, Barnes says, the impact is felt at the community level. ""Most people just want to play sport to have fun,"" she says. We've compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQI+ people, their families and friends. ""People who play sport know it's about more than just winning. It's about actually playing with people and getting to know people."" Cheung agrees, saying fearmongering risks the health and wellbeing of everyday trans and gender-diverse people. ""This is a community that needs the physical and mental health benefits of exercise because they have a higher risk of heart disease, depression and anxiety, suicide attempts and suicides,"" she says. ""They need that sense of belonging because often trans people don't have that. They need to be included in communities and reap the benefits of exercise like everyone else.""

23,Verstappen takes advantage of Leclerc's power failure to win Spanish Grand Prix,sport," Sport Max Verstappen wins Spanish Formula 1 Grand Prix, Daniel Ricciardo finishes 12th A suspected engine failure has cost Charles Leclerc at the Spanish Grand Prix, helping Max Verstappen claim victory and the championship lead. Leclerc led by more than 10 seconds and was the fastest car on track when he lost power on lap 27 of 66 in the scorching Barcelona sun. Verstappen, who spun off the track and had a faulty DRS, made a three-stop strategy work for him as the defending champion moved ahead in the drivers' championship. Leclerc had the perfect start from pole position and led into turn one, building a small margin to Verstappen over the opening laps. When a gust of wind at the left-handed turn four later sent Verstappen into the gravel, the Ferrari driver looked set to extend his lead in the drivers' championship. Leclerc said he had no warning before his car failed, ending his hopes of a third win of the season. ""I had no indications before and it just broke and lost power completely,"" he told Sky Sports F1. ""It's a shame. In those moments I believe there is nothing else I can do but look at the positives. ""We cannot afford for this to happen many times during this season so we need to find the problem."" Verstappen had a frustrating race for the first 27 laps, with the spin on lap nine dropping him from second to fourth. After being allowed past by his teammate Sergio Perez into third, Verstappen spent more than a dozen laps behind the Mercedes of George Russell. Verstappen's DRS problems from Saturday's qualifying came back to haunt Red Bull during the race. When the Dutchman went to open his rear wing for the speed boost it would intermittently fail, making overtaking Russell a challenge. The same problem cost Verstappen a chance at pole position on Saturday in qualifying, angering the world champion who was heard swearing over the radio to his team. But once Leclerc was out Red Bull immediately pitted Verstappen to change to a three-stop strategy. It was a masterstroke as Verstappen was able to put the mechanical issues behind him and dominate the race. ""We managed to sure the strategy to get ahead … to do our own race and eventually win,"" Verstappen said. ""I tried to stay focused, it's not nice when stuff like that happens. ""At the end I'm very happy to win."" By entering his 216th race, Daniel Ricciardo will set a new Australian record for the number of races in F1, with eight wins and 32 podium finishes over 11 years. Despite starting from ninth position, Daniel Ricciardo had a largely forgettable Spanish Grand Prix. The Australian moved up to eighth early before falling down the order and never looked like threatening the top-10 finishing in 12th. It was better news on the other side of the McLaren garage, with Lando Norris driving a super race. The Briton started 11th after a difficult qualifying session on Saturday, but he was faultless in Sunday's race. Norris rallied to finish eighth, securing much-needed points for McLaren.

24,West Coast Fever belt record Super Netball score,sport," Sport West Coast Fever post record Super Netball score with 86-77 win over GWS Giants West Coast Fever have broken their own record for the highest Super Netball score in their 86-77 victory over the Giants at Perth Arena. The previous points record of 82 — held jointly by the Fever and Giants — fell by the wayside in Sunday's second-versus-third shootout, thanks chiefly to the world's best shooter, Jhaniele Fowler. The Giants defence had no answers for the towering Jamaican who contributed 68 of the Fever's points, shooting at 99 per cent. Her efforts helped the Fever bounce back from the disappointment of Tuesday's home loss to the Melbourne Vixens and consolidate a top-two spot while giving coach Dan Ryan a birthday to remember. ""This was a tough one where we knew we had to come out and execute the gameplan well,"" Fowler said. ""We did for most of the game. ""Still work to be done but congratulations to us for working through it."" Fowler put Fever's nose in front 23-21 at the end of an exciting, free-flowing opening term, with Giants captain Jo Harten making life difficult for West Coast skipper Courtney Bruce at the other end. The home side tightened up on defence and stretched their lead in the second term, while Fowler continued to keep the scoreboard motoring. The pattern of the match was established — Fowler unstoppable for first 10 minutes of each term and then Harten (nine super shots) doing her best to limit the damage across the last five in reply. Down 46-37 at half-time, the turnovers mounted in the third term for the Giants who fell behind by 13 at the final change. With the verdict seemingly beyond doubt, the primary point of interest in the fourth stanza centred on when the Fever would break the scoring record — and by how much. Their lead swelled to 18 when Fowler equalled the 82-goal milestone with 5:42 to play but a rare scoreless drought of over three minutes meant there was a long wait for number 83, appropriately netted by Fowler. A flurry of Harten super shots added some respectability to the scoreboard for the Giants, before Fowler finished things with a rare two-pointer in the last second. In the late game, a severely-depleted Adelaide Thunderbirds side moved into third spot after notching a courageous 58-53 victory over Collingwood Magpies at Melbourne's State Netball Centre. The Thunderbirds's victory was all the more remarkable considering they went into Sunday's match in sixth place and without three of their regular starters due to influenza. Skipper Hannah Petty and sharpshooter Lenize Potgieter were ruled out on Saturday, while vice-captain Maisie Nankivell was withdrawn hours before the game. Despite the tumultuous backdrop, Adelaide — who leapfrogged past Queensland Firebirds, NSW Swifts and the Giants — rallied thanks to a gutsy all-court performance.

25,Melbourne City to face Western United in ALM grand final,sport," Sport Melbourne City to face Western United in ALM grand final after defeating Adelaide United Jamie Maclaren sealed Melbourne City's 2-1 win over Adelaide United in extra time in the second leg of their A-League Men semi-final. City is now one win away from becoming the first team to complete consecutive A-League Men premiership-championship doubles. Maclaren's 92nd-minute goal capped off a dramatic second-leg comeback and tees up the first all-Victorian ALM decider against Western United at AAMI Park on Saturday. It will be City's third consecutive grand final appearance. Scores were locked at 0-0 after Wednesday's first leg in Adelaide and Zach Clough's wonderful 48th-minute dink put the Reds in front at AAMI Park, before Marco Tilio equalised in the 74th minute to take the game to extra time. It was City's first victory over a top-four team from 11 attempts this season. In just their third season, Western United will play off for the championship following their semi-final win over Melbourne Victory. The first half was largely defined by big saves from Adelaide goalkeeper Joe Gauci and City counterpart Tom Glover. Then, three minutes after half-time, Javi Lopez found Clough, who took a touch with his left foot then coolly chipped a looping, dipping volley over Glover's head. Adelaide almost doubled its lead in the 57th minute, when Kusini Yengi beat Curtis Good and attempted to finish from a tight angle, only for Connor Metcalfe to clear it over the bar. Patrick Kisnorbo turned to Tilio off the bench in the 58th minute and 16 minutes later, the Socceroo delivered. Andrew Nabbout floated in a cross and it went over the head of a leaping Mathew Leckie, but Tilio burst in at the back stick and headed home off the post. In the 84th minute, Tilio charged forward and let rip with a cracking long-range effort, forcing a brilliant diving save from Gauci. Yengi attempted to tee up Bernardo in the 90th minute but the young substitute could not get a shot on target. Two minutes into extra time, Maclaren held up the ball for Metcalfe and while Michael Jakobsen got in the way of the midfielder's shot, he did not properly clear it. The shallow clearance fell straight to Maclaren, who buried his 16th goal of the season at the near post to seal the grand final berth and condemn Adelaide to back-to-back semi-final exits.

26,Ricciardo eyes off solid result in record-breaking F1 race,sport," Sport Ricciardo starts F1 Spanish Grand Prix ninth, Charles Leclerc on pole Daniel Ricciardo says he is hopeful of his second top-10 finish of the season, after qualifying ninth for Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix. The Australian out-qualified McLaren teammate Lando Norris for the first time in 2022 after Norris had a lap time deleted for going off the track and was knocked out in Q2. Ricciardo said the weekend had been a learning curve for the team, who bought new car upgrades to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. He said practice sessions had been ""tricky"" as the team tried to perfect the set-up of their car. By entering his 216th race, Daniel Ricciardo will set a new Australian record for the number of races in F1, with eight wins and 32 podium finishes over 11 years. But once qualifying started, Ricciardo looked assured of a top-10 start, which the Australian hopes is a sign of greater things to come as he prepares to set a new Australian record of 216 F1 starts. ""I think we're still fighting a little bit in some areas so I'm just trying to perfect it,"" he said. ""On paper, ninth is a solid place to start and we'll keep chipping away. ""So hopefully we'll keep finding bits and pieces and get some solid points."" Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start the Spanish Grand Prix on pole after a blistering lap at the end of qualifying. The championship leader spun his car on his first flying lap in Q3, meaning he had one chance to snatch pole away from Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Leclerc then blitzed the field with a 1 minute 18.750, three-tenths quicker than Verstappen, who did not complete a second lap after reporting a loss of power.

27,Hawthorn stuns Brisbane in Tasmania thriller,sport," Sport AFL ScoreCentre: Hawthorn stuns Brisbane in Launceston. Collingwood, GWS record wins Hawthorn have overturned a big margin to snap their four-match AFL losing streak with a stunning five-point upset of Brisbane. The Hawks looked gone when they conceded four consecutive goals out of the half-time break and trailed by 22 points midway through the third term. But with returning star Tom Mitchell (36 disposals) and young gun Jai Newcombe (27) influential in the middle, they surged home to win 18.9 (117) to 17.10 (112) on Sunday. It was the Hawks' first victory since Easter Monday and the highest score Brisbane have conceded this season, coming in just their second loss of the campaign. There was one concern for Hawthorn, when ruckman Max Lynch was taken from the field in the dying stages after an accidental clash of heads with Darcy Fort. The Hawks' can ill-afford to lose another ruckman, with Ben McEvoy (neck) and Ned Reeves (shoulder) already sidelined. In an epic arm wrestle in Launceston, the lead changed hands nine times, including five times during a see-sawing final term. Impressive Brisbane youngster Jaxon Prior put his side in front from one of many soft free kicks paid throughout the day before Mitch Lewis replied almost instantly to snatch back the lead for the last time. Hawthorn kicked three straight goals to break clear in a match-winning burst as the Lions lost Hugh McCluggage to a hamstring injury. Lewis stood tall against a Brisbane defence that sorely missed Marcus Adams, who was out through virus protocols. Key forward Lewis kicked four goals, with Chad Wingard (three), Sam Butler and Dylan Moore (both two) also contributing. Stand-in Hawks captain James Sicily kept Brisbane spearhead Eric Hipwood quiet. Charlie Cameron kicked 3.3 for the Lions and could've given them a sniff with just enough time remaining. But his dribbled shot from the boundary missed with teammates appealing for a pass in the corridor. Dayne Zorko's goal put Brisbane back within a kick with just two seconds left on the clock. Prior finished with three goals in an impressive display and Lincoln McCarthy kicked two, the first in each half. Jarryd Lyons (32 disposals) and Daniel Rich (33) were among the Lions best, while Brownlow Medal fancy Lachie Neale started strongly but drifted out of the game, finishing with 25 and a goal. Hawthorn had a 36-27 free-kick advantage in a game that featured a raft of soft decisions by the trio of whistle-happy umpires. AAP Collingwood's teenage supersub Oliver Henry has amplified Fremantle's wet-weather worries as the Magpies bucked the odds to post a 36-point AFL win at Perth stadium. The Dockers struggled for fluency in last week's 36-point loss to Gold Coast in the wet, and a pre-match downpour on Sunday ensured another slippery affair. The Magpies were dealt a blow midway through the second quarter when ruckman Mason Cox was subbed off with a finger injury. But his replacement Henry became an unlikely hero, with the 19-year-old booting four second-half goals to help propel Collingwood to the 12.8 (80) to 6.8 (44) victory. Will Hoskin-Elliott, Brody Mihocek and emerging star Jack Ginnivan shared the load up forward with two goals apiece, with Henry dominating after half-time. Ginnivan earned the ire of Fremantle fans in the final term when he outmarked Brennan Cox and celebrated in front of the Dockers' faithful while he strolled in to kick the easiest of goals. The win improved Collingwood's record to 5-5 ahead of next Sunday's MCG blockbuster against arch rivals Carlton. Fremantle started the season with a stunning 7-1 record, but back-to-back losses in the wet have raised serious questions about whether their game plan can hold up in slippery conditions. Big splashes of water were seen whenever a player hit the turf early in Sunday's match. Collingwood forward Jamie Elliott almost took a mark-of-the-year contender in the first quarter, while Nathan Murphy was forced off briefly for treatment after being crunched by Andrew Brayshaw. Jordan De Goey's class ensured scores were tied at quarter time, and the Magpies pulled clear in the second quarter on the back of three unanswered goals. Hoskin Elliott's pack mark and goal early in the third term set alarm bells ringing for Fremantle, but a clever snap from Michael Walters in the opening minutes of the last quarter saw the Dockers close the margin back to 16 points. Henry starred from that point on, booting three goals in the last term to kill off Fremantle's resistance. Will Brodie (36 disposals, 11 clearances) and David Mundy (35 possessions) led the way for Fremantle. Collingwood lost the possession count by 49 and contested possessions by 23. But their efficiency with the ball meant they won the inside 50m count 60-46, allowing their forwards to kick a winning score. AAP Greater Western Sydney have started their new era under Mark McVeigh in style with a 52-point thumping of West Coast at Giants Stadium. The Giants outclassed the undermanned Eagles from the opening bounce to give McVeigh the best possible start as interim coach with a 21.12 (138) to 13.8 (86) victory on Sunday. The Eagles will also be sweating on the fitness of Luke Shuey after their captain was substituted out of the match in the final term. Both teams were missing several stars, especially after the Giants made nine changes to their team from last week, but the hosts settled quicker with four unanswered goals in the opening nine minutes that set the tone for the match. The Giants went on to post their biggest first-half score since round 4, 2016 — and their second-highest ever — to lead 14.3 to 5.4 at the main break. The most identifiable change made by McVeigh and the coaching group that now includes his former Essendon teammates James Hird and Dean Solomon was to switch Harry Himmelberg from the forward line to defence. Himmelberg looked comfortable in the back line and enjoyed the freedom to launch some torpedoes when kicking in after behinds, with one long bomb in the second term flying beyond the centre circle. He was also able to add to the 17 goals he had already booted this season, after a 50m penalty on the wing set up a shot from the 50m arc that Himmelberg slotted. With Himmelberg pushed to the back line, Jarrod Brander spent more time forward in his third match for the Giants since being delisted by the Eagles at the end of last season. Brander finished with 16 disposals and a goal against the club that drafted him from the Giants Academy with a first-round pick in 2017. Co-captain Stephen Coniglio starred in an on ball role with 36 disposals at 92 per cent efficiency, while fellow co-captain Josh Kelly (29 disposals) continued his strong form in the Giants midfield. The Giants shared the goals around with youngster James Peatling kicking three majors and six players including Toby Greene and Jesse Hogan finishing with two. Tim Kelly (23 disposals) and Jack Redden (20) battled hard in the Eagles midfield and Alex Witherden (18) looked to provide some run out of defence. Andrew Gaff made a slow start on his return to the Eagles line-up with only five disposals in the first half before spending more time on ball to finish with 19 touches. The Giants face a tougher test when they take on Brisbane at the Gabba on Saturday while the Eagles will play the Western Bulldogs at home.

28,"Sharks return to winning ways, Rabbitohs fall to Raiders",sport," Sport Cronulla Sharks score 25-18 NRL win over Gold Coast as Canberra defeats South Sydney 32-12 Cronulla has returned to the winners' list by defeating Gold Coast 25-18 in wet conditions in Robina. In Sunday's earlier match in Dubbo, Canberra celebrated its third win in a row after beating South Sydney 32-12. Following an underwhelming move to fullback last weekend, Sharks captain Nicho Hynes returned to the number seven jersey in style, scoring a try and setting up another as the visitors ran in four tries to three. Hynes then iced the game after a Titans' fightback with a last-minute field goal. Former Australian rugby sevens international Lachie Miller, making his NRL debut at fullback for Cronulla, also shone in the wet. The Olympian ran for 201 metres, made 10 tackle busts and scored a sensational breakaway try as the Sharks moved to 7-4 for the season. A fortunate bounce from a Jayden Campbell bomb in the 53rd minute allowed the ball to fall into Miller's arms and the 27-year-old sprinted through a staggered Titans' line before streaking 70 metres to score. His moment capped a three-try burst at the start of the second half where the Sharks took control of a game that had been locked 6-6 at half-time following tries from Gold Coast forward Jarrod Wallace and Cronulla centre Connor Tracey. Hynes was central to the match-winning spell, finishing off a break by Ronaldo Mulitano in the 43rd minute to put his team ahead, before firing a wonderful pass in the 51st minute for Mulitano to dive over. A smart gather by Wallace from Toby Sexton's grubber with nine minutes to play allowed the Titans prop to score his second try of the night and gave the hosts' hope. Wallace and Sione Katoa then got into a scrap after the Titans forward took exception to the Cronulla winger's treatment of AJ Brimson. From the resulting penalty against the Sharks, Masters scored to give the Titans a chance of an unlikely comeback before Hynes's ice-cool field goal conversion sealed the two competition points. Canberra stalwart Josh Papalii has marked his 250th NRL match with a dominant display, as the Raiders stifled the Rabbitohs for a third straight win. The Raiders scored four first-half tries in racing to a 20-0 lead, before completing a comfortable win. The result breathes life into the Raiders' season, as they are now 5-6 after their campaign had earlier looked shaky, while the Rabbitohs boast that same record after losing three of their last five matches. Fittingly, prop Papalii's made an early impact in his milestone match by powering over for a trademark try, shortly after returning star Jack Wighton had created an opener for winger Nick Cotric. The Raiders' forwards looked hungry early and delivered plenty of big hits as they took control through the middle, with a huge goal-line shot from Papalii denying Liam Knight points at 8-0. They again struck through the middle when hooker Tom Starling put a try on a platter for Hudson Young, before an electrifying team move saw a Corey Horsburgh flick pass create a line break that let Seb Kris cross to cap an outstanding half at 20-0. Any chance of a patented Raiders fade out seemed put to bed early in the second half when a Jordan Rapana flick put Matt Timoko through, although the Rabbitohs finally got on the board on 52 minutes when hooker Damian Cook broke three tackles and scored for 24-6. But Canberra withstood the surge and sealed the win through star youngster Xavier Savage, who flashed his pace and sliced through the Rabbitohs' line for his first try of the season. Papalii ran for 116 metres to go with eight tackle busts and his try. It was a lamentable display from the Rabbitohs, who completed just 61 per cent of their first-half sets and allowed a staggering 30 tackle breaks in that period. They will end the round eighth on the table but teams are queuing up to remove them from the finals spots, with Manly, St George Illawarra and Canberra all also on five wins.

29,Tiger Woods pulls out of PGA Championship,sport," Sport Tiger Woods withdraws after PGA Championship third round due to soreness in his surgically-repaired right leg Tiger Woods has withdrawn from the PGA Championship after shooting a 9-over-par 79 in Saturday's third round. It marked the first withdrawal in Woods' professional career. Woods, 46, shot 1-under-par over the final five holes Saturday to avoid recording a score in the 80s for the third time in a major. Still, it was his worst round ever at a PGA Championship. It was a gritty effort at the end for Woods, who started the day at 3-over 143 and finished at 12 over and stood 21 strokes out of the lead when his third round ended at Southern Hills Country Club. Clearly struggling to make it through 18 holes on his rebuilt right leg, Woods and his team declined an on-camera interview with CBS Sports following the round. Instead, Woods and his reps told the CBS television crew that he was sore. On Friday, Woods made the cut at a major for the second time in two tries since nearly losing his right leg 15 months ago in a devastating single-car crash in southern California. He shot a 1-under-par 69 on Friday to sneak in under the cut line. In the third round, he started with a par but found the water on the second hole for a bogey. His real troubles began on the par-3 sixth hole, when his tee shot landed in the water again, his shot from the drop area found the rough to the left of the green, and he hit his pitch short of the green. After hitting a chip shot to about two feet from the cup, he putted out for a triple-bogey 6. From there, Woods' round unravelled on a chilly morning. He bogeyed the seventh and the ninth to leave him with a 41 on the front nine. The bogey on the par-4 ninth hole was the first of five straight bogeys for Woods, a four-time PGA Championship winner. He won at Southern Hills in 2007, the most recent time the tournament was played at the course. Woods never before had carded five straight bogeys at a major championship. The bright spot of Woods' day came on the 413-yard, par-4 15th. Woods flashed his first smile of the day when he drained a 12-metre putt for his only birdie on the round. Woods' worst-ever round in a major championship came in 2002, when he shot an 81 in the third round at The Open Championship at Muirfield -- the same year in which he won the Masters and the U.S. Open. He shot an 80 in the first round of the U.S. Open in 2015 at Chambers Bay.

30,Knee injury sours Ellie Carpenter's Women's Champions League win with Lyon,sport," Sport Australia's Ellie Carpenter stretchered off with knee injury in Lyon's Women's Champions League final win over Barcelona Lyon women have regained their European crown, but the joy is bittersweet for Australia's Ellie Carpenter after she suffered a potentially serious knee injury. The full-back was substituted after 13 minutes of Lyon's 3-1 win in the UEFA Women's Champions League final after her knee gave way in open play. A few minutes earlier she had hurt it while challenging Fridolina Rolfo. She received her medal on crutches with her left leg in a brace, which ran all the way up to her thigh. Lyon were already a goal up when Carpenter departed, Amandine Henry having scored a stunning goal after six minutes. Ada Hegerberg added a second and Catarina Macario a third to put Lyon 3-0 up inside 35 minutes. Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas pulled one back before the break but Lyon used their experience to manage a goal-less second half. Lyon have now won eight of the last 12 Women's Champions Leagues, but this was as warmly received as any having been eclipsed in many people's eyes by Barcelona. However Lyon, who beat Barca 4-1 in the 2019 final, did not play them in last season's competition having been knocked out by domestic rivals Paris St Germain. But they did not have Hegerberg in the team then as she was recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The Norwegian said pertinently before the final: ""There was women's football before Barcelona, and it was played here [Lyon] for years. We have to win again to regain our place in world football."" Hegerberg's recovery — she was outstanding in the final — offers hope for Carpenter if, as feared, she has also suffered an ACL injury, a common injury in women's football. The Matildas will be hoping that Carpenter's recovery will be straightforward with the FIFA Women's World Cup to be played in Australia and New Zealand beginning in July next year. Matildas and Lyon defender Ellie Carpenter opens up on her ""scary"" move abroad, the pressure of replacing a legend and what she's expecting from the Champions League final. Lyon had taken the lead when Henry won possession before scoring from 30 yards. After Jenni Hermoso had missed two good chances Hegerberg headed in Selma Bacha's cross to double the lead. Catarina Macario tapped in a Hegerberg cross with Barca in disarray before Putellas scored in the 41st minute to give them hope. Though Patri Guijarro hit the crossbar in the 58th minute from 50 yards Barcelona were unable to get the second goal which could have had Lyon worried.

31,Could there be a changing of the guard at this year's French Open?,sport," Sport Teenage tennis sensation Carlos Alcaraz could signal a changing of the guard with victory at the French Open There was a time when the three certainties in life were death, taxes and Rafael Nadal winning the French Open. The Spanish bull has lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy on a record 13 occasions. Few would discount a 14th triumph but the 35-year-old has been troubled by foot and rib injuries in the past 12 months. At last year's French Open, Nadal lost an epic semi-final to the eventual champion Novak Djokovic. Since then, the exciting Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz has had a rapid rise. At the recent Madrid Open, the 19-year-old became the first player to beat modern greats Nadal and Djokovic in the same tournament on clay. Within three days, he took care of Nadal, Djokovic and then the world number three Alexander Zverev in the final. ""It's an amazing story, I don't think we've seen someone with such flair and capability and natural talent since the man that he's always revered, who is Rafa,"" commentator and former tour player Louise Pleming told ABC Sport. ""He's got power, he's got a lot of energy, and coming off his big win in Madrid, beating Nadal would've been a huge boost, beating Djokovic — I think that's a great sign."" Commentator and six-time grand slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs believes the world number six Alcaraz is headed for the top. ""There is a real chance that he can be number one in the world by the end of the year,"" Stubbs told the Court-Side with Beilinson tennis podcast. ""The key is can you mentally grasp being the best player in the world, and I think what he's just done in the last couple of months has proven to him that he can be the best player in the world."" The emergence of Alcaraz is similar to the way a 19-year-old Nadal took the tennis world by storm by winning the French Open at his first attempt in 2005. Now a wise veteran, Nadal is not surprised by the hype surrounding his young countryman. ""He's new and all the new things are much more interesting,"" Nadal said at the Italian Open earlier this month. ""When you see a new car, it always looks better, when you see a new phone, it always looks better than the old one. ""I'm happy to have someone like him from my country achieving all the things that he's achieving."" Alcaraz is coached by a man who knows how to win the French Open. Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero lifted the trophy in 2003. His pupil has won four tournaments this year and is the youngest to win the ATP events at Rio, Miami, and Madrid. ""He has no weakness in his game, zero,"" Stubbs said. ""I love the fact that he actually goes into the net a tremendous amount to finish points off. ""He moves better than any player on tour, equivalent to Novak when he was at his best, he has the splits, he can get out wide he can explosively move forward, side to side."" Djokovic himself is hitting form at the right time after beating world number four Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets in the Italian Open final. The unvaccinated world number one won't be lacking motivation after being deported from Melbourne before January's Australian Open. A triumph at Roland Garros would put the Serb back alongside Nadal for the most men's grand slam singles titles (21). ""I feel he is very much an inspired man at the moment,"" Pleming said. ""The form that he was in at Rome, he didn't drop a set there which is phenomenal. ""He's just fine tuning at the right time and I believe he's got that extra fire burning in his belly."" Alcaraz is yet to make his mark in the majors. The best performance in his fledgling career was reaching the quarter-finals of last year's US Open, when a leg injury forced his retirement in the second set against Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime. ""Is this just a little bit early for Alcaraz?"" Pleming said. ""If he plays some five-set matches early on you just wonder physically how he's going to manage that whereas Djokovic just knows how to pace himself. ""He's just got a little bit more of the mentality to last and be there on that final day."" The women's tournament will be the first grand slam since Australia's Ash Barty announced her shock retirement while ranked world number one. Iga Świątek will start the white-hot favourite. The top-ranked Pole has won five tournaments in succession. During that stretch, she's reeled off 28 wins and dropped only five sets. If Świątek is victorious at the French Open, she'll equal Venus Williams's 35 straight victories from the year 2000, which is the best winning streak by a female this century. Świątek was a surprise French Open winner in 2020, but her opponents will know all about her this time. Whether they can stop her is another matter altogether. ""Gosh that seems like the impossible mission at the moment,"" Pleming said. ""I love the way that she plays, she's really taken the baton from Ash Barty. ""She's got the variation, she's got the power, she's using her serve incredibly well but it's the mindset, that something she's borrowed from Barty as well, how to control the mind and her mentality."" Despite being only 20, Świątek has shown no signs of being overwhelmed by the pressure that comes with being expected to win a grand slam. ""For sure the expectations around are higher, but I never had a problem to cut it off and not to think about it,"" Świątek said after winning the Italian Open earlier this month. ""Also I'm gaining experience at that, with more and more tournaments it's going to get better for me to cope with all of that."" There are numerous players in the draw who have the clay court expertise to challenge for the title. World number two Barbora Krejcikova is the defending champion, while world number four Maria Sakkari made the semi-finals last year. Ons Jabeur was on an 11-match winning streak until being swept aside by Świątek in the Italian Open final. Stubbs expects the world number six from Tunisia to perform well in Paris. ""The variety of her game, she plays a little bit like Ash, she uses the slice backhand so beautifully, she has a better two hander than Ash ever did,"" Stubbs said. ""The possibility of Ons winning a grand slam is super high, she has all the shots and of course the drop shot from hell for everybody to play against."" Pleming believes Jabeur is one of the few players capable of upsetting Świątek at Roland Garros. ""It's great to see players that play differently to everybody else, they get to mix it up, they make the other players more uncomfortable than the players who play that hard-hitting aggressive game style."" Whoever wants to win the French Open is likely to face the task of overcoming a former French Open champion in irresistible form, who loves playing on the red clay at Roland Garros. ""I just can't see anyone getting past Iga,"" Pleming said. ""To win a grand slam, it makes it a whole lot easier if you know you've already done it.""

32,Aussie Jai Hindley ideally placed after show of strength in Turin,sport," Sport Australia's Jai Hindley seven seconds off the lead at Giro d'Italia after stage 14, as Richard Carapaz takes the maglia rosa Simon Yates went solo in the finale to win the 14th stage of the Giro d'Italia as Richard Carapaz took over as overall race leader — but Jai Hindley is looming in second place after a brilliant tactical ride by the Australian and his team. Briton Yates, whose title ambitions had already been dashed, attacked from a group of four with four kilometres left to prevail in Turin after a 147-km ride from Santena. Hindley's Bora-Handsgrohe team had blown up the race with more than 60km to go, with a big surge led by his teammate Wilco Kelderman that fractured the group of general classification (overall) contenders. Ecuador's Carapaz, who was third on the day behind Hindley, snatched the leader's maglia rosa jersey from Juanpe Lopez after the Spaniard cracked on the penultimate ascent of the day. Former champion Vincenzo Nibali was fourth, 15 seconds down on Yates and beaten in the sprint by Hindley and Carapaz. Ineos-Grenadiers rider Carapaz, who won the 2019 Giro when riding for Movistar, attacked on the Superga climb, a five-kilometre ascent at an 8.6 per cent gradient, and Lopez lost touch to finish four minutes and 25 seconds off the pace. Carapaz was however caught by Hindley, Nibali and Yates on the final ascent to the Colle della Maddalena and he lacked a bit of juice for the decisive sprint. Hindley came through for second in the final sprint, outlasting Carapaz to take a six-second time bonus. Overall, Carapaz now leads Hindley by seven seconds, and Portugal's Joao Almeida, who took sixth place 39 seconds behind Yates, by 30 seconds. Hindley came second to Britain's Tao Geoghegan-Hart in the 2020 edition of the Giro, and the Perth-born rider is now well in the mix for another podium finish in Verona next Sunday. Tom Dumoulin, the 2017 winner, abandoned early in the stage as he was suffering from back problems. Sunday's 15th stage is a brutal 177km mountain trek from Rivarolo Cavanese to Cogne in the Aosta valley.

33,Last-gasp penalty sees Blues down Brumbies,sport," Sport Last-minute penalty by Beauden Barrett sinks Brumbies in Super Rugby Pacific Beauden Barrett has slotted a field goal after the full-time siren for the Blues to steal a famous Super Rugby Pacific victory from the Brumbies in Canberra. The Blues' 21-19 win — a club record 12th straight — moved them further ahead on top of the ladder and likely relegated the Brumbies to third place with one round to play. The Brumbies, despite being camped in their own half defending for a bulk of the game, went ahead by one when Billy Pollard's try was cooly converted by Noah Lolesio with 70 seconds to play. They won the ball from the restart but lost possession and then watched as the visitors worked towards the posts, winning a penalty despite protests from the hosts. Under advantage, All Blacks playmaker Barrett calmly slotted the winner to end what had shaped as another feel-good story for Australian rugby. The Brumbies were furious at a penalty count 16-5 in the Blues' favour and at one point had made 95 tackles to the Blues' 38. ""We showed so much heart tonight; our backs were against the wall through the whole game,"" Brumbies captain Allan Alaalatoa said. ""I think some of those were our fault, but mate I reckon we'll get an apology later in the week, some videos [reviewing the penalties]. ""We defended our hearts out and I just don't feel we were getting the rub of the green … but we still managed to be up in the 79th minute."" With the Crusaders five points clear in second, the Brumbies look likely to miss the chance of a home semi-final, instead now needing a win over Moana Pasifika to secure third ahead of the surging Chiefs. ""That was almost Test match intensity with the young packs and see-saw nature of the game,"" Barrett said. ""When you come to Canberra you're up for a hell of a fight and we certainly got that."" The hosts had shot out of the blocks and led 7-0 after Pete Samu found a patch of grass to plant the ball in the second minute. But it was all the Blues after that, the Auckland outfit applying immense pressure as they threatened to reply. But it remained that way for almost 40 minutes, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck one of three would-be Blues scorers held up over the line and Kurt Ekland's try overruled for a knock-on. Folau Fainga'a and Darcy Swain were sin-binned as a 12-1 penalty count took its toll, but still they held firm until Barrett crossed for a try off a scrum after the half-time siren. Brumbies halfback Nic White broke that momentum with a sharp intercept at the resumption, running 80 metres before Fainga'a scored soon after from a maul to put the hosts back in front. Blues winger Caleb Clarke limped off with a hamstring injury but Karl Tu'inukuafe's try and another penalty gave the Blues a six-point lead inside the final five minutes. Pollard scored his late try off a trademark Brumbies lineout and maul and Lolesio snuck his conversion inside the right post to put them up by one with just over a minute to play, before the Blues pulled off their great escape.

34,Yang among new stars to emerge at national swimming titles,sport," Sport William Yang among new stars to emerge at national swimming titles William Yang is the new Australian men's 100 metres freestyle champion. The 23-year-old won the title at the Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide in a personal best time of 48.55 seconds, with two-time Tokyo Olympics relay bronze medallist Zac Incerti (48.65) second and 16-year-old sensation Flynn Southam (48.76) third. Australia's sprint king Kyle Chalmers was not competing in the race after he elected to only race butterfly events at the championships. It is the first time in years that the Olympic 100m freestyle gold and silver medallist has not competed in the national championships. ""It's a little weird when you don't have the big fella (Chalmers) pacing up and down and talking a bit of smack to you,"" Incerti said. Yang and Incerti will swim in the individual 100m freestyle races at the world championships next month in Budapest and at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games in July. Yang said he recently took eight months off from the sport and was close to quitting. ""In the past I had too many thoughts in my brain,"" said Yang, who is a former backstroker. ""It's not just swimming, it was like financially, peer pressure. I think it's a bit different coming from an Asian background as well. You have family expectations."" Asked to describe his family expectations, Yang said :""I can't really describe it, I can just feel it. ""I don't think my family actually put that much expectation on me, but I felt it."" But Yang said both his parents, who were born in China, would be proud of him. Incerti, who has spoken openly about his mental health struggles in the past, said sport was going in the right direction in terms of talking about depression and anxiety. ""I've had some of my darkest times with mental health and whatnot,"" he said. ""I do my best to try to talk about it openly and honestly and I know a lot of people go through the same stuff. ""I just try to help as many people as I can and show people that it does always get better even though it might not feel like it at the time."" Yang and Incerti both spoke glowingly about Southam, who is set to be selected for the world championships and Commonwealth Games in the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relay teams. ""He's [Southam] going to do amazing things in the future, and I can't wait to be next to him and maybe get beaten by him one day,"" Incerti said. ""That guy's [Southam] going to be real, real good,"" said Yang. Southam described the experience of competing in the 100m freestyle final as ""awesome"" ""I've learnt so much from those guys, seeing how they go about their business in the marshalling room,"" he said. ""It's awesome to swim alongside them, it's a privilege and I really just have a lot of respect for those guys. ""It was just a great experience being here at my first trial meet only being 16. I'm just really privileged to be here."" Southam has been compared to both Chalmers and Ian Thorpe because he has swum similar times to what those two were swimming at the same age. ""I respect Kyle, I respect Thorpie, those guys are legends of the sport,"" Southam said. ""But I know Kyle had his own path, Thorpie had his own path … individual world champion at 15. It's ridiculous, I'm a big fan of his. ""So you've got to respect and acknowledge those guys are greats of the sport, but I'm on my own path as well."" In other events, three-time Olympic gold medallist Kaylee McKeown won the women's 200m backstroke final. McKeown won in a time of 2:05.31, more than a second outside her Australian record. Mollie O'Callaghan (2:08.48) finished second and Minna Atherton (2:10.20) was third. McKeown and O'Callaghan will represent Australia at the world championships and Commonwealth Games. O'Callaghan said she planned to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle races at the two competitions, in addition to the 100m backstroke and the relays. Bowen Gough defended his title in the final of the men's 200m butterfly in a time of 1:56.49. Gough will be the only Australian to swim the event in Budapest and Birmingham. It the first time the 24-year-old has made an Australian team. Olympic bronze medallist Brendon Smith defended his national title in the men's 400m individual medley. Smith (4:11.88) will be joined by Se-Bom Lee (4:14.77), who finished just .01 ahead of third-placed Kieren Pollard (4:14.78). ""It's a pretty stacked field … so you can't get complacent, as soon as you do that you get beaten,"" Smith said. Nineteen-year-old Lani Pallister capped her win in the women's 800m freestyle by claiming the 1,500m freestyle in a personal best time of 15:55.40. ""I'm really excited. I think the journey has been a lot more special than the meet itself,"" Pallister said.

35,Commonwealth Games selectors hold breath as Steph Wood suffers knee injury,sport," Sport Diamonds star Steph Wood injured as Sunshine Coast Lightning beat Queensland Firebirds A knee injury to Steph Wood has soured Sunshine Coast Lightning's 82-61 Super Netball upset win over the Queensland Firebirds and sparked concern for the Diamonds' Commonwealth Games preparations. The last-placed Lightning thrust a dagger into the Firebirds' finals hopes in Brisbane on Saturday but, with the Diamonds team for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games to be finalised next week, the national selectors eyes will be on Wood. The Lightning skipper and Diamonds vice-captain was dominant, running the hosts ragged with 22 points and 23 feeds before leaving the game with a knee injury in the third quarter. Otherwise, it was a rousing performance from the Lightning in the local derby, with Woods' teammates running away with the game after the captain's departure. Goal shooter Cara Koenen led with 46 goals, while Tara Hinchliffe's four gains at goal defence clearly disrupted the Firebirds attack line. ""I think the difference is having no expectations,"" Koenen said. ""We knew we could play like that but it's disappointing it's taken so long."" A month ago the Firebirds were pressuring the top two but they are now outside the top four after a fourth straight loss. Their season is now on the line as they face second-placed West Coast Fever next round in Perth. With everything to play for, the Firebirds were surprisingly off key in the first half. It was the little things that burned them. Gretel Bueta was twice called for stepping, Lara Dunkley spilled a simple pass out of court and they conceded twice as many penalties as their opponents. Losing so much possession hurt, and by halfway through the second quarter the Lightning led by eight goals. In contrast, Wood had the game in her hands. The tough, selfless lines she ran created hectares of space for circle partner Koenen, and she burst free at the end of the half to shoot a pair of super shots that sent the Lightning ahead 36-28 at the long break. Wood continued to run amok during the third term as the visitors stretched their lead to 14. But the crowd of 4,306 gasped late in the quarter when the goal attack fell to the court after jarring her knee. The anguish on her face was obvious as she left the court for treatment from Lightning physiotherapist Greg Craig. In the late game, the Melbourne Vixens completed an impressive, 59-53, comeback victory against the NSW Swifts at John Cain Arena. After absorbing the best the Swifts could throw at them in an even first half, the Vixens found another gear and remain clear on top of the ladder in their pursuit of the minor premiership and potentially a home grand final. For the fourth-placed Swifts, it was a missed opportunity to steal a two-win buffer over the Queensland Firebirds (fifth).

36,Western United reach historic A-League Men grand final,sport," Sport Western United defeat Melbourne Victory to reach historic A-League Men grand final Serbian striker Aleksandar Prijović scored twice and added an assist as Western United advanced to their first A-League Men grand final with a 4-1 win over Melbourne Victory at AAMI Park. United made the season decider in just their third season and ended Victory's club-record 16-match unbeaten run in the process, progressing to the final with a 4-2 semi-final aggregate win in a pulsating match on Saturday. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, United twice hit the front as Prijović capitalised on two wonderful crosses to score in each half. Prijović set up the decisive third goal in the 78th minute, as his delightful lay-off fell to Lachie Wales, whose shot deflected off a Victory player into the net for the go-ahead goal. The excellent Dylan Wenzel-Halls added the icing with a fourth in the ninth minute of added time. Prior to United's fourth goal, Victory had a number of chances to level the tie and also had an unsuccessful penalty shout. A Jake Brimmer free kick in the 82nd minute forced a good fingertip save from Jamie Young and Victory twice came close to scoring in the 88th and again in added time, with all three efforts coming from substitutes. Francesco Margiotta hit the post, Chris Ikonomidis blazed a follow up shot from close range over the bar, and Brendan Hamill had a shot pushed away by Young. United scored with their first attempt on target in the 18th minute, with Prijović's far-post header rewarding a delightful cross from Connor Pain. Victory midfielder Brimmer again put his side ahead on aggregate with a peach of a free kick in the 37th minute, the fourth straight match in which he has scored. Young made a full stretch save to keep a powerful Josh Brillante shot out in the first minute of the second half. United briefly thought they were ahead again when Wenzel-Halls's header hit the net just after half-time, only to be correctly ruled out for offside. Three minutes later they did hit the lead through Prijović's fine sliding finish from an excellent Wenzel-Halls cross. Victory ratcheted up the pressure after going behind for a second time, with Young making saves from Ben Folami, Marchan and Nick D'Agostino. The home side were adamant they should have had had a penalty in the 42nd minute when Josh Risdon appeared to foul Rai Marchan. Referee Alex King did not award a spot kick at the time and reaffirmed his decision after being called to the touchline by the VAR to view a replay of the incident.

In Saturday's earlier matches, North Queensland thrashed the Melbourne Storm 36-6 in Townsville, St George Illawarra got past the Warriors 24-18 at Kogarah. With NSW coach Brad Fittler looking set to lose superstar Tom Trbojevic for the season, he would at least have taken some joy in Luai's performance against the Roosters. The Panthers five-eighth scored two tries, forced two drop-outs, busted four tackles, had three offloads and broke the line once in his second-last hit-out before Origin I on June 8. Teammate Stephen Crichton boosted his case for one of NSW's two vacant centre spots, scoring a length-of-the-field try to put the game to bed in the second half. It came as the defending premiers backed up their 32-6 flogging of an understrength Storm last week with a domination of the Roosters. The win puts the Panthers four points clear at the top of the ladder, a handy buffer they will welcome given the amount of players they will have in Origin. The Roosters could lose a player more immediately, with prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves on report for a high tackle and sin-binned for dissent. The Roosters veteran clocked James Fisher-Harris high as he crossed late, and then twice swore when speaking to referee Gerard Sutton when informed it would be a possible eight-point try. The incident highlighted a sorry night for Trent Robinson's team, who desperately missed the injured Victor Radley's direct running in attack as they often went sideways in their limited time with good ball. That issue was exemplified by the form of Isaah Yeo in the Penrith line up, who has quickly become the competition's best lock. Yeo was influential in Penrith's first try, taking the ball to the line and putting Scott Sorensen through a gap before Luai loomed up in support play. Luai's second came four minutes later when the Panthers ran it on the last, with he and Cleary combining before the five-eighth spotted a gap when Luke Keary slipped over in defence. The five-eighth also played a lesser role in the Panthers' next try, forcing a line drop-out to give his team one last set before halftime. They took full advantage, with Api Koroisau going over from dummy-half when the Roosters line rushed out expecting a Cleary field goal attempt. The Roosters in comparison could not take their chances when it mattered most. The hosts had the bulk of the ball in the 20 minutes after half-time but emerged from it even further behind when Crichton marked a Keary kick and went 95 metres to score. And while James Tedesco and Paul Momirovksi crossed for tries late in the second half, they too often lacked any real punch in attack, posing too few questions for the Panthers. Injuries to Jason Taumalolo and Kyle Feldt have taken some gloss from North Queensland's thumping of the Storm in front of a sellout crowd in Townsville. The Cowboys were staring down 12 straight losses to Craig Bellamy's side, with their last win coming in the 2015 preliminary final. But a six-tries-to-one performance on Saturday night marked their sixth win in a row and will have fans contemplating premiership aspirations as they went level on points with the second-placed Storm on the ladder,. Without stars Ryan Papenhuyzen and Jarome Hughes — and playing hooker Harry Grant in the halves — the Storm failed to fire in the second half as North Queensland dominated possession, territory and the intensity of the contest. Three tries in eight minutes early in the second half blew the Cowboys' 12-6 half-time buffer out to 30-6. Winger Murray Taulagi boosted his State of Origin selection push with an aerial put-down, fullback Scott Drinkwater found the line off a poor defensive read and young forward Jeremiah Nanai added two more tries to his season tally to be second in the competition with 10. The Cowboys could easily have won by more but Coen Hess was ruled for a double movement with his crash play and Melbourne winger Xavier Coates miraculously held up Taulagi over the line after a break. But in their glory came worry, with both co-captain Taumalolo and in-form winger Feldt suffering suspected knee injuries in the first half. Feldt's left leg was bent back awkwardly in a tackle. he was able to hobble off but must be in serious doubt to contend for the June 8 Origin series opener after he made his debut for Queensland in 2021. Taumalolo departed the field with a suspected right knee injury. The pair's injuries end a stellar run with injury for the club after coach Todd Payten was able to name the same starting side for four consecutive rounds. Taumalolo has led the NRL statistically in post-contact metres in a strong season start after suffering three separate hand injuries in season 2021. Feldt had scored seven tries in seven NRL appearances in 2022, with four coming in his last three games. In the first half, a brilliant solo effort by Tom Gilbert got the Cowboys on the board when he gathered the ball from a short goal-line drop out in the 12th minute and broke through the tackle of Marion Seve. Tom Dearden then found Reece Robson six minutes later from a quick play-the-ball for a try, before Felise Kaufusi finally cracked the Cowboys' defensive wall to score in the 32nd minute. That was the Storm's only try as North Queensland scored 30 or more points for a fifth consecutive game and Valentine Holmes kicked a perfect six from six conversions. St George Illawarra coach Anthony Griffin may have found the answer to his fullback dilemma after an electric display from Cody Ramsey helped the Dragons to their win over the Warriors. In front of 7,147 fans at a rain-soaked Jubilee Oval in Kogarah, Ramsey returned from a hamstring injury sustained in round three and took to the number one jumper with ease, scoring a try and setting up another. Griffin has toyed with Tyrell Sloan and Moses Mbye in that role earlier this year, but Ramsey looked every part an NRL fullback in a Dragons side who moved up to 10th on the ladder with the victory. The loss extends a month of woe for the Warriors, who have just one win in their last five under coach Nathan Brown. The home side began in the best possible fashion when Warriors halfback Shaun Johnson dropped the first kick-off of the afternoon, allowing Zac Lomax to touch down for the Red V on the very next set. But from this point it was the Warriors who had the upper hand. Johnson scored one of his own and sent up two aerial kicks for Dallin Watene-Zelezniak to bat back in field for Viliami Vailea to touch down. Ramsey was the only response the Dragons could offer as he burst into the line and slipped through some feeble Warriors defence to get his first try of the season. St George Illawarra trailed 14-12 at half-time and the Warriors looked set to pull away when Watene-Zelezniak crossed for his first try of the match. Fullback Reece Walsh's inaccuracy with the boot — he kicked one from four — proved to be the Warriors' undoing. They also lost star prop Addin Fonua-Blake to injury. It meant that when NRL debutant Michael Molo barged over the line from close range, the Dragons were level after Lomax converted. Ramsey had looked threatening whenever he brought the ball back from the backfield and a shift play to the Dragons' right edge allowed him to burst upfield in the play which broke the match open. Off the back of Ramsey's break, Lomax found his way over the line. He missed his conversion but added a penalty to make it 24-18 with 10 minutes to go. Despite a late scare from the Warriors in the final 30 seconds, Griffin's side held on for their fifth victory of the season.

38,Richmond beats Essendon in spiteful contest in Dreamtime at the 'G,sport," Sport AFL ScoreCentre: Richmond beat Essendon in Dreamtime at the 'G, Essendon have taken another hit in their AFL season from hell, suffering a 32-point defeat to Richmond in a fiery clash on Saturday night. Dion Prestia (36 disposals) starred and Jack Riewoldt kicked four goals for the Tigers in their 11.14 (80) to 7.6 (48) win at the MCG. The match started with the traditional pre-match Dreamtime ceremony on the pitch, during which Richmond players paid tribute to their Indigenous stars, the whole team participating in the war cry. Between the sirens, Indigenous talents Shai Bolton and Maurice Rioli Jnr gave fitting contributions in the Dreamtime feature match, kicking two goals each. Liam Baker (30 disposals) and Daniel Rioli (26) continued their outstanding seasons and Robbie Tarrant stood tall in defence. Prestia received the Yiooken Award as best afield. But Kane Lambert was substituted out with hip soreness and Tom Lynch (hamstring) sat out the final quarter of a fourth consecutive win that firmed up Richmond's (6-4) spot in the top-eight. Put under a fierce blowtorch this week, Essendon needed to show more fight than in their meek round-nine surrender to Sydney. Ben Rutten's men repeatedly flew the flag in a fiery contest against the Tigers but never looked like being able to produce an upset win that could have sparked a turnaround in their campaign. The loss left them floundering near the foot of the ladder with a 2-8 record. And making matters worse, Mason Redman was reported for striking Prestia off the ball. Darcy Parish racked up 43 touches, including 19 contested possessions, in a losing cause but wasn't clean in his disposal by foot. Zach Merrett (33 disposals) and Redman (29) found plenty of the ball and youngster Ben Hobbs kicked two goals. Essendon great Matthew Lloyd led the chorus of criticism against his old club in recent days and would have been at least been pleased to see the Bombers show some aggression from the outset. Sam Draper led the response that followed Tom Lynch crashing into Matt Guelfi's back and Redman laid a ferocious tackle to pin Bolton holding the ball. It was one of 20 tackles laid by Essendon in the first quarter after they tallied just 30 for the entire game a week earlier. But for all the Bombers' endeavour, they coughed the ball up too easily and were outclassed by a far more efficient Richmond side that featured 18 premiership players. A run of five-straight Tigers goals either side of the first break gave them a lead they never relinquished. Richmond sewed up a comfortable, if not pretty, victory midway through the final term when Bolton kicked his second major and cheekily waved 'goodbye' to the Essendon cheer squad. AAP/ABC Max King was the difference as St Kilda kicked the final four goals to overrun a brave Adelaide and claim a 21-point AFL victory at Adelaide Oval. Saints spearhead King booted six goals straight while the Crows failed to make the most of their opportunities in front of goal as the Saints won 14.6 (90) to 9.15 (69) on Saturday night. King was the star throughout and well-supported by speedster Bradley Hill in his 200th match. The Saints' midfield, missing captain Jack Steele due to a shoulder injury, was made to battle deep into the final term before sealing the win, but Hill stepped up with 30 disposals and a team-high 568m gained. Hill's run-and-carry and clean kicking stood out in a scrappy contest and helped King do the damage closer to goal. Brad Crouch was also important in his second match against his former club, with a goal and 14 of his 31 disposals contested. Jack Sinclair was also prolific with 32 disposals. Ben Keays continued his strong form for the Crows with 27 disposals and Jordan Dawson was important with 22 touches and two goals but the lack of a focal point cost them. Brodie Smith was another of the Crows' best and finished with 28 disposals and 659m gained. It was a spirited opening from the Crows with Riley Thilthorpe looking lively and kicking an early goal in his first match since round one after a stint in the reserves and later on the sidelines with a knee injury. But the Crows weren't able to make the most of their 18-9 inside 50s and trailed 1.5 to 2.1 at the first change after King slotted his second goal just before quarter-time. The hosts continued their dogged efforts through the second term but again failed to capitalise on the scoreboard, and a 4.8 to 3.3 halftime lead was quickly erased by a goal to Tim Membrey and two more to King. The Crows' inaccuracy in front of goal ultimately left the door open for the Saints to make the late charge that now has them well-placed for finals with a 7-3 record. St Kilda will continue their chase for a top-four spot against North Melbourne next Sunday while Adelaide face Geelong at GMHBA Stadium on Saturday. AAP Melbourne have secured their 17th-straight AFL win, barely getting out of second-gear in accounting for an improved North Melbourne by 47 points. Last year's wooden spooners put in one of their best efforts of the season, even closing within six points midway through the third quarter, but the Demons (10-0) simply had too many weapons at Docklands on Saturday. After booting the last two goals of the third quarter to lead by 22 points at the final change, Melbourne, who have rebranded themselves as Narrm for Sir Doug Nicholls Round, ran out winners 14.16 (100) to 8.5 (53). Star midfielder Clayton Oliver was clearly the best player on the ground, grabbing a career-high 45 possessions — the second time this season he has passed the magical 40 mark in a game — and 13 clearances. After five weeks of uncompetitive performances that has shone the spotlight on coach David Noble, North fought hard until the Demons' weight of numbers — 74 inside-50s to 34 — eventually won out. Tom McDonald and Bayley Fritsch kicked three goals each for the Demons, as did Cameron Zurhaar for North. Melbourne's only concern was a suspected rib injury to winger Ed Langdon, who was on the end of a big Tarryn Thomas tackle in the first quarter. Langdon was subbed out of the match for small forward Toby Bedford. The Kangaroos' Curtis Taylor also suffered a rib injury and was replaced by Atu Bosenavulagi in the final term. Melbourne will host Fremantle in a top-four showdown at the MCG next Saturday, while the Kangaroos will be back at Docklands to face St Kilda on Sunday. The Demons now have the most consecutive wins any AFL team has racked up since St Kilda won the first 19 games of the 2009 season. They are just two wins away from equalling the historic club's greatest streak, set back in 1955-56. AAP Geelong have broken Port Adelaide's four-game AFL winning streak, withstanding a fierce early challenge to win easily by 35 points. The Cats kicked seven goals to two after half-time on Saturday at Kardinia Park and won 11.16 (82) to 7.5 (47). Geelong improved to 6-4 and won two in a row for the first time since round four. But Cats star Patrick Dangerfield was subbed out of the game in the last quarter with a tight calf. Tyson Stengle kicked three goals for the Cats in Indigenous round and defender Tom Stewart starred, while midfielder Cam Guthrie racked up 37 possessions, including 15 contested. Cats key forward Jeremy Cameron also kicked three goals, including a booming screw punt on three-quarter time that did a lot to decide the game. Port utility Dan Houston had 30 disposals and took 11 marks. After a scrappy opening, Port key forward Jeremy Finlayson fittingly kicked the first goal of the match in Sir Doug Nicholls Round. Finlayson, a distant relative of Sir Doug, goaled 17 minutes into the first quarter. The Cats kicked the last three majors of the term to lead by 11 points. Port briefly hit the front in the second quarter, but Geelong led by a point at the main break. The Cats surprisingly took no marks inside 50m before half-time, despite ideal conditions and an attack boasting Tom Hawkins, Cameron and Gary Rohan, who returned from injury for his first game of the season. But the Cats went up a gear in the third, kicking five goals to one. Finlayson had a very gettable shot on goal late in the term and kicked it out on the full. The Cats raced the ball down the other end and Stengle kicked his third. Cameron took a strong mark and kicked a massive goal with a screw punt from 50m on the three-quarter time siren to put another dagger through the Power. Tellingly, heading into the last quarter the Cats had 20 scoring shots to nine. AAP The Western Bulldogs have beaten a fast-finishing Gold Coast by 19 points to claim consecutive victories for the first time in 2022 and get their AFL season firmly back on track. Luke Beveridge's Bulldogs have struggled for consistency all season but in front of a buzzing crowd in Ballarat, snatched the ascendancy via four unanswered third-quarter goals, and never gave up their lead from there to prevail 15.16 (106) to 13.9 (87). Claiming back-to-back wins evens the inconsistent Bulldogs' ledger at 5-5 and sets the Suns back to 4-6. Marcus Bontempelli booted three clutch goals and had 24 disposals and Bailey Smith (34 disposals) continued his stellar season, while Ed Richards and Bailey Williams were influential at half-back and half-forward respectively. Aaron Naughton looked set to break the game open with three first-half goals but was quietened by Sam Collins in the second half. The Suns deserved plenty of credit for never giving up, especially after losing Rory Thompson to a second-quarter knee injury while they were also without Jy Farrar (concussion) after half time. It was only Thompson's third game back after missing three seasons through two knee reconstructions. Joel Jeffrey was brilliant, booting five goals, and was supported by Ben Ainsworth (three goals) while David Swallow worked hard in midfield. The Bulldogs drew first blood but the Suns got a foothold in the game when Farrar marked on the forward flank but Bulldogs youngster Buku Khamis came in late and high, giving away an immediate 50-metre penalty and subsequently, a goal. Bulldogs gun Naughton was ominous up forward, booting two first-quarter goals while Jeffrey kicked a pair, including one after the siren, to cut the quarter-time deficit to eight points. Naughton instinctively snapped his third early in the second term but Gold Coast stayed in the game via a clever finish from Ben Ainsworth, while Jeffrey added his third by intercepting a handball then snapping over his head. The third period proved a cagey affair until Josh Dunkley took a big grab and kicked truly, with 200-gamer Adam Treloar, Robbie McComb and Bontempelli extending the lead beyond five goals. Jeffrey stemmed the Suns' bleeding by snapping his fourth and the Suns fought back from there. The Bulldogs threatened to seal four points on multiple occasions, especially when Bontempelli booted his third from long range. But Gold Coast fought back time and time again in the final term, until McComb soccered his second with 37 seconds left, with Smith hammering home a wonderful goal on the final siren.

39,Cameron Smith accidentally strikes opponent as Aussie's US PGA hopes dwindle,sport," Sport Cameron Smith accidentally hits opponent on nearby hole as Australian hopes fade at US PGA Championship Cameron Smith has let the leaders slip away in an opportunity lost at the US PGA Championship in Oklahoma. Smith remains an outside chance but will need to defy history after labouring to a second-round even-par 70 at Southern Hills Country Club on Saturday. Australia's world number four is two-under for the Championship, seven shots adrift of American pacesetter Will Zalatoris, after failing to take advantage of a favourable change in conditions. As his rivals cashed in on a dramatic wind shift mid-round with a barrage of birdies, Smith went backwards with two bogeys on his homeward nine to leave himself playing catch-up over the weekend. Bogeys on the 10th, when he missed the green left, and on number 15, after leaving his bunker shot in the trap, sent Smith tumbling from fifth into a log-jam of players sharing ninth spot. Smith's round was not helped by a wild tee shot that he sailed onto an adjacent hole, accidentally striking Aaron Wise of the USA on the head. History favours the frontrunners at Southern Hills, with all seven winners of the previous seven PGA Championships played at the venue having at least a share of the 36-hole lead. That leaves Zalatoris in the box seat to hoist the Wanamaker Trophy on Sunday after the 2021 Masters runner-up shot to nine under with a sizzling 65. Chilean Mito Pereira (64) is one shot behind after missing a short birdie putt on the last to tie the course record jointly held by Tiger Woods and Raymond Floyd. Woods, for his part, made the cut with a one-under-par 69 in the second round, 15 months after nearly losing his right leg in a car accident. He moves to three over four the tournament thanks to four birdies on Saturday. Chasing a second PGA Championship triumph, Justin Thomas is third at six-under after posting a successive 67, this time in the fierce morning winds. Smith's fellow Australians Lucas Herbert, Jason Day, and Marc Leishman also made the halfway cut, but will be making up the numbers. Herbert also lost ground on Saturday, falling to one over for the championship with a three-over 73. Day, champion in 2015 and runner-up in 2016, fought hard to pull back to even with the card, only to finish his second-round 72 with three straight bogeys to slip to three over — a dozen strokes adrift of Zalatori. Leishman (71) is also three over, while Cam Davis (72) birdied his last two holes to make the cut on the number at four over. Min Woo Lee (72) at five over and Adam Scott (70) at seven over missed the cut. Meanwhile, Australian Whitney Hillier has snatched the lead heading into the final round of the Ladies European Tour event at Evian Resort Golf Club this weekend. Fresh off a team win at the Aramco Series in Bangkok, Hillier posted a level par round of 71 for a 36-hole total of four-under-par, which included a sensational hole-in-one on the eighth to complement the hole in one she sunk yesterday on a course where two others achieved the feat on the same day. Hillier now holds a one-stroke lead as she looks to clinch her maiden singles victory.

40,'It's the next level': Ellie Carpenter grew up in the spotlight — now she's basking in it,sport,"  Matildas and Lyon star Ellie Carpenter opens up on fear, family and the future ahead of her second Champions League final Ellie Carpenter is dawdling along a beach somewhere in Dubai. She's dressed casually in a white T-shirt that reads ""Peace Through Practice"" and a pair of comfy green shorts. Her iconic, white-blonde hair hangs loosely behind her shoulders, a pink hair-tie wrapped around her wrist. She sways gently as she walks, answering fun, light questions about herself for a quick-fire interview: her favourite time of day, three things she can't live without, what makes her smile. Asked to describe herself in one word, she says ""bubbly"" before giggling into the next question. This sunny, care-free young woman stands in stark contrast to the Ellie Carpenter football fans often see on the field: a right-back who is uncompromising, fearless and daring beyond her years. Now Carpenter is on the verge of achieving something no other Australian footballer has done: winning two Champions League finals when her French club, Olympique Lyonnais, take on reigning champions Barcelona on Sunday morning. Looking at her life from the outside, it's hard to believe she has only just turned 22. On the inside, Carpenter can hardly believe it, either. Trying to figure out how to play football at the highest possible level is one thing, but trying to figure out who you are and how you fit into the world at the same time is quite another. ""I've had to grow up very quickly,"" Carpenter told ABC from her home in Lyon. ""I didn't have a normal teenager kind of life. I went straight from leaving school [at 17] and into a national team with girls so much older than me, so I kind of missed that stage in my life: being a kid, being a teenager, doing those kinds of things. ""It has been hard. I've been away from home since I was 15. And, thinking now, I just turned 22, and it feels like I've been doing this for so long. Sometimes I forget how young I am. ""It's funny because a lot of people around me at the club here, they still can't believe my age. So they think I must be mature, which is nice. ""Honestly, when I think about everything I've done already, it's really crazy. But I do want to achieve more and keep growing as a footballer and as a person as well. It's been quite the journey already."" It certainly has. For a player so young, Carpenter has already lived a robust footballing life. Growing up on a farm in the small town of Cowra in central New South Wales, Carpenter played with and against boys until she was 12 before her family relocated to Sydney to find her better opportunities. Three years later, while still studying at Westfield Sports High School, she made her professional debut with Western Sydney Wanderers in the 2015-16 W-League season, starting every single game. Even back then, you could see the raw materials of what Carpenter has been forged and sharpened into now: the natural athleticism, the one-on-one physicality, the desire to gallop forward and help attack, the ferocious dedication in defence. She was the archetypal modern full-back before she knew it. It was the spark that got her noticed by then-Matildas coach Alen Stajcic, who handed her a senior national team debut against Vietnam in 2016, becoming the first Australian footballer born in the 2000s to pull on the green-and-gold. Four months later, at 16 years of age, she became the youngest Australian competitor at the Rio Olympics, as well as the youngest-ever woman footballer to compete at the Games in its history. She followed up these age-based milestones at club level, too, becoming the youngest player to appear in America's National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) when she debuted with Portland Thorns, aged 18, in 2018, as well as their youngest-ever goal-scorer when she netted for them 10 days later. A stand-out season back in Australia with Melbourne City resulted in one of the biggest moves for an Australian woman footballer when she was signed by seven-times Champions League winners Lyon in 2020. Carpenter's life has come at her fast. She didn't get to experience the regular stuff that most of us do as we try to figure out who we are or what we want our lives to look like. She admits that — even though she had to skip that awkward, stumbling teenaged chapter — she still felt a child-like fear when the big European move beckoned. ""The most scared I've been was this move to Lyon,"" she said. ""It's obviously such a big club. You don't know what to expect. You don't know how the team is going to be: the language, the culture. ""It was a lot of pressure signing here. Lucy Bronze was here before me as well — she was leaving and people were like, 'Oh, is she going to fill her shoes?' ""But the transition into this team and into France is the easiest transition I've had to do anywhere. It's the nicest team I've  been part of, the most welcoming team I've been in. I was so surprised. ""After a week or so, I could be myself. And I really appreciated that … it's an environment that makes you thrive and makes the best come out in yourself because you feel comfortable on and off the pitch."" It helps that she's not the odd foreigner out: Several of her team-mates — such as Catarina Macario, Christiane Endler, Tokyo gold medallist Kadeisha Buchanan and Ballon D'Or winner Ada Hegerberg — come from elsewhere in the world, too. They all share a group chat and meet up regularly outside of football, exploring the city that's famous for its food and its history: They've become her second family. But what glues the team together is arguably its French veterans, anchored by captain Wendie Renard, midfielder Amandine Henry, winger Amel Majri and striker Eugenie Le Sommer. They've formed the foundation of this all-conquering women's club — the most successful in women's football — and continue to set the tone and standards for newcomers like Carpenter, who has since become a starter in the side. ""First, coming into the team, I was scared of them,"" Carpenter laughs. ""But, honestly, they're so nice. They help you with anything. ""I've learned a lot from them, with their experiences. Some of them have won eight Champions Leagues … like, that's incredible. ""Wendie just played 100 Champions League games. So, to have them on the pitch with you — all the time, learning from them, seeing how they cope in situations of pressure — it's so nice to have them and know they have your back as well. ""Everyone's so professional here, some of the most professional I've seen. ""Coming from previous clubs and seeing what everyone does here, it's like, 'Oh, OK, this is why you guys win everything. This is why you're so good.' ""It's the next level here, but it's nice to be exposed to that, for me to see that so young so I can follow in their footsteps."" It's this environment that has made Carpenter more ready than ever for the biggest game of her career: Sunday morning's Champions League final against holders Barcelona, who continue to topple records after winning every game of their most recent league while also repeatedly attracting more than 90,000 fans to their home games. However, the intensity and pressure of Carpenter's daily life has moulded her into the fierce, mature competitor she always knew she could be, to the point where she is barely even bothered by the occasion now. ""For me, it's just another normal game,"" she shrugs casually. ""I haven't really thought about it. I don't really put it up above any other game or think that I'm going to do something different. ""Obviously it's a bigger stage and a bigger atmosphere, but these are the games we live for and you want to play for. ""When we walked out [against PSG in the semi-final], at the sold-out Parc de Princes stadium, they were all PSG supporters and everyone's going nuts. When we scored, the stadium was just silent. It was so cool — probably one of the coolest games I've played in my career. ""I love the pressure. It makes me perform better. It really makes you get the best out of yourself, and that's one thing that, when I came here, I knew was going to be the hardest thing: to perform when you're supposed to and not crumble. ""I've handled that well — now, it's just kind of normal. ""It's going to be an amazing game. Hopefully we can win."" The bubbly young footballer from Cowra has grown up in the footballing spotlight.

41,"FA investigating Palace manager Patrick Vieira after fan altercation, pitch invasion",sport,"  English FA investigating Crystal Palace manager after pitch invasion, altercation with fan The English Football Association is investigating all incidents of fans invading the field and has condemned the ""anti-social behaviour"" as completely unacceptable. The FA's statement came after Everton fans invaded the pitch at Goodison Park following Dominic Calvert-Lewin's 85th-minute winner at the final whistle of Thursday's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace, which secured the side's spot in the Premier League next season. Palace manager Patrick Vieira was also involved in an altercation with a fan when he was walking towards the away dressing room after the final whistle. The fan appeared to provoke Vieira with hand gestures, after which Vieira kicked him to the ground and had to be led away by other supporters. ""We are very concerned about the rise in anti-social behaviour from fans as we reach the end of the season,"" the FA said on Friday. ""Football stadiums should always be a safe and enjoyable space for everyone, and these incidents are completely unacceptable and have no place in our game. ""It is illegal to enter the pitch area in any stadium and these actions are putting players, fans and people who run the game at great risk. This simply cannot continue and we can confirm that we are investigating all of the incidences."" The FA said clubs needed to prevent pitch invasions from occurring and urged them to take their own action against those who broke the rules and the law. ""The FA will be seeking to do all that it can to work with clubs as well as addressing the issues from a disciplinary perspective,"" the statement added. West Ham United manager David Moyes said such incidents had been an ""issue"", while Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said pitch invaders posed a danger to players and staff. ""We have to stop it and we have to minimise the risk and exposure of players and staff in this situation because you cannot control,"" he said. ""When there are so many people involved it becomes dangerous."" Vieira, who has been nominated for Premier League manager of the season, declined to comment after the match. There have also been a number pitch invasions in England's lower leagues in recent weeks. Nottinghamshire Police said a man was arrested and interviewed on suspicion of assault as part of an investigation into video footage showing an incident during Tuesday's Championship play-off semifinal between Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United. Police did not provide details of the incident but a video on social media showed United striker Oli McBurnie, wearing a surgical boot, appearing to stamp on a fan on the ground during a pitch invasion after Forest won on penalties at the City Ground. A Forest fan who headbutted United captain Billy Sharp during the pitch invasion was jailed for 24 weeks and handed a 10-year football banning order on Thursday. Swindon Town manager Ben Garner said his players were ""physically and verbally abused"" after their League Two play-off semifinal defeat by Port Vale. Swindon were beaten 6-5 on penalties by Vale, whose fans invaded the pitch after the last penalty, and television footage appeared to show some in an altercation with Swindon players.

42,Wimbledon stripped of ranking points for banning Russian and Belarussian athletes,sport,"  Wimbledon stripped of ranking points by ATP and WTA for banning Russian and Belarusian athletes The ATP and WTA have stripped Wimbledon of its ranking points over its decision to exclude players from Russia and Belarus at this year's championships due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The tennis governing bodies had banned Russia and Belarus from international team competitions following the invasion, but they have allowed players from the two countries to compete as neutrals. But Wimbledon has gone one step further and banned the athletes outright, prompting the ATP and WTA tours to strip the grand slam of its ranking points, which effectively reduces the world's most famous tennis tournament to an exhibition event. ""The ability for players of any nationality to enter tournaments based on merit, and without discrimination, is fundamental to our Tour,"" the ATP said in a statement. ""The decision by Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer undermines this principle and the integrity of the ATP Ranking system. It is also inconsistent with our Rankings agreement. ""Absent a change in circumstances, it is with great regret and reluctance that we see no option but to remove ATP Ranking points from Wimbledon for 2022."" WTA chief Steve Simon said athletes participating in an individual sport ""should not be penalised or prevented from competing solely because of their nationalities or the decisions made by the governments of their countries"". ""The recent decisions made by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to ban athletes from competing in the upcoming UK grass court events violate that fundamental principle,"" Simon said. ""As a result of the AELTC's position that it will not honour its obligation to use the WTA rankings for entry into Wimbledon and proceed with a partial field not based on merit, the WTA has made the difficult decision to not award WTA ranking points for this year's Wimbledon Championships."" The move by the AELTC, the organiser of the grass-court grand slam, is the first time players have been banned on grounds of nationality since the immediate post-World War II era when German and Japanese players were excluded. The AELTC has previously said the ban on Russian and Belarusian players was its only viable option under the guidance provided by the British government. On Friday, the AELTC reiterated its stance, adding it was considering its options and was in discussions with its grand slam colleagues. ""In addition, we remain unwilling to accept success or participation at Wimbledon being used to benefit the propaganda machine of the Russian regime,"" the AELTC said in a statement. ""We therefore wish to state our deep disappointment at the decisions taken by the ATP, WTA and ITF in removing ranking points for The Championships. ""We believe these decisions to be disproportionate in the context of the exceptional and extreme circumstances of this situation and the position we found ourselves in, and damaging to all players who compete on Tour."" Wimbledon's ban on Russian and Belarusian players has been slammed by top players such as 21-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal who labelled it unfair, and world number one Novak Djokovic, who said he did not support the decision. ""Our rules and agreements exist in order to protect the rights of players as a whole. Unilateral decisions of this nature, if unaddressed, set a damaging precedent for the rest of the tour,"" the ATP added. ""Discrimination by individual tournaments is simply not viable on a tour that operates in more than 30 countries. ""We remain hopeful of further discussions with Wimbledon leading to an acceptable outcome for all concerned. ""More broadly, we believe this matter again highlights the need for a united governance structure across professional tennis so that decisions of this nature can be made in a joint manner."" While Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) reciprocated the Wimbledon ban by excluding players from the two countries from its tune-up tour events, its decision is still under review by the ATP and WTA and also faces potential sanctions. Meanwhile, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said it would not grant ranking points to Wimbledon this year for junior and wheelchair tennis events. ""The ITF has determined that Wimbledon's entry criteria banning Russians and Belarusians compromises the integrity of its international competition, in particular its ranking system, as there is a lack of alternative equivalent opportunities for players to compete for ranking points and prize money,"" the ITF said.

43,"Poised to break race record, Ricciardo tells ABC he believes more podiums are on the horizon at McLaren",sport,"  Daniel Ricciardo to break Australian F1 record at Spanish Grand Prix Daniel Ricciardo will set a new Australian record on Sunday when he lines up for the start of the Formula 1 Spanish Grand Prix. The McLaren driver will compete in his 216th race in F1, surpassing the Australian record held by Mark Webber. Ricciardo has had a memorable career in F1, with eight race wins and 32 podium finishes over 11 years. Webber retired with nine race wins and 42 podium finishes. From leaving his home in Western Australia at 17 to chase his motorsport dream in Europe, Ricciardo told ABC Sport he was proud to have survived for so long in the cut-throat world of F1. ""I am proud of achieving a number like 216 this weekend because getting into F1 is a struggle in itself but then to stay here for that long, I think, is something I can be proud of,"" he said. ""I was a very young 17-year-old as well, so making that commitment when I didn't really know if that was 100 per cent sure what I really wanted to do, or could do… was a big deal."" Reflecting on his career ahead of his record-breaking weekend, Ricciardo said his first race win at the 2014 Canadian Grand Prix was still among his proudest moments. ""You chase something for so long and you believe that you can do it, but you really don't know you can do it until you've done it,"" he said. Australia's Daniel Ricciardo overtakes Nico Rosberg on the penultimate lap to win the Canadian F1 Grand Prix. ""I was proud I was able to execute everything I believed in, so that was a big moment."" But the man widely known as the Honey Badger does not believe his best days are behind him. The Australian has arguably had some of his greatest struggles since joining McLaren in 2021. Even in his most trying times, he won the Italian Grand Prix, giving McLaren their first race win in nine years. At the time he said he had ""never left"", referencing those who believed he had lost his touch after struggling in his first season at McLaren. ""Not only did I get the podium, I won in Monza after what had been probably my toughest year in Formula 1,"" he said. ""So if I can do that (win) in a season like that (2021) then podiums are definitely possible. ""I know it's easier said than done in this sport but I believe I'll be up there, hopefully, a few times this year."" He now couples that trademark confidence with more than a decade of experience in motorsport's pinnacle class. He told ABC Sport he still approaches every race the same way but said he drives with more maturity and a level head. ""I definitely believe I can have some amazing performances to come and really that's why I keep doing this, because I still believe I can,"" Ricciardo said. ""That's the stuff that will keep me in the sport for longer."" Ricciardo goes into Sunday's race 11th in the drivers' standings, with 11 championship points. He has one top-10 finish in the five races so far this season — coming sixth at the Australian Grand Prix. In Spain this weekend, Ricciardo will be hoping to equal or better his performance there last season, when he finished sixth and beat his teammate Lando Norris.

44,'A gaping hole' in Australian tennis: Grand slams without Ash Barty,sport," Sport Roland-Garros without Ash Barty — What's next for the first grand slam without our champion? Australians will need to get used to seeing it — grand slam tennis without our former world number one, Ash Barty. As the French Open draws near, it marks the first major tennis tournament without Barty with the 126th staging of Roland-Garros in Paris. Along with that comes a changing of the guard worldwide as Tennis Australia looks towards the future to try fill the hole left by Barty at the top of the sport. So who's left to carry the Aussie flag on the grind of the international tour? As it stands, Australia lacks consistent star power at the top after Barty. Just 23-year-old Alex de Minaur sits inside the top 50, at 21st in ATP rankings, well ahead of the rest of Australia's pack: James Duckworth (70), Nick Kyrgios (76), Jordan Thompson (82), Thanasi Kokkinakis (85) and John Millman (93). After de Minaur, the latter crop are all 26 years and older. On the women's side of the draw, only Ajla Tomljanovic is among the top 100, at 44th in WTA rankings — just outside of seeding at the French Open. Just two other Aussie women were guaranteed places on the red soil with Astra Sharma (144) and wildcard Daria Saville, who jumped almost 500 places in an injury-free run from 627 at the start of January, to a current 130. Tennis coach Roger Rasheed — who helped the likes of Lleyton Hewitt, Grigor Dimitrov, Gael Monfils and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga — knows what Australians will miss. ""For us tennis enthusiasts and sporting enthusiasts, it's a little sad that we don't get to see what Ash Barty does on a day-to-day basis in major events,"" Rasheed said. ""There's a time when you know everyone's different, and you know we're pretty excited that she's got a chance to enjoy her life as a young woman as well in another way."" Rasheed said although Barty won't be touring the tennis circuit, the 'brand' of Ash Barty could be used to continue the legacy for inspiring next generation. ""We've got to be grateful that we had the opportunity to have someone who reached the top of the game, sat there for a couple of years and did it with such poise and humility that actually sort of galvanised and brought people together to watch and follow. ""(Barty is) brilliant role modelling and messaging. You've now got that to run with and be used in a whole lot of different areas. ""It's going to be interesting to see the new breed of athlete that comes out."" There's only one Ash Barty. To try and replace the irreplaceable will be a task that takes time, at the very least for Tennis Australia coffers who will lose out over her shock retirement in March. not even two months after breaking a 44-year title drought at the Australian Open. Australian coach, commentator, and former player Wally Masur says it's time to look towards the next generation to fill the post vacated by Barty. ""Yeah, it's a big blow for tennis, absolutely,"" Masur said. ""She was so successful, but what she brought to the sport, you know her style of play was quite unique on the women's tour. It's a really attractive style of play and she's such a gracious champion. It's a big hole… an even bigger hole here in Australia."" ""In my opinion she was only going to get better. She was capable of winning more slams and she was improving all the time."" While it’s not uncommon for Australian tennis scene to have shining lights, Masur reflected on players like Pat Cash, Lleyton Hewitt, Pat Rafter, Mark Philippoussis, Sam Stosur and Barty as the most successful individuals in recent years, but a focus in the short term will be to look at the next crop of players trying to take the next step by cracking into and consolidating a spot in the top 100. In men's, there are six Australians in the 100-200 range, while in women's there are six in the same range, and another five in the 200-250 rankings — some way off Barty's ability. With the Roland-Garros main draw beginning on Sunday, nine Aussie women and three men contested qualifying for a spot in the main draw. However, only world number 161 Jason Kubler made the cut for his first main draw appearance on the clay surface. ""If a few of those girls can break that ceiling in transition all of a sudden it's a much better story you're painting,"" Masur said. ""(It's about) getting that next generation to step up and make their mark."" One of those in the next generation is 20-year-old Olivia Gadecki. After showing promising potential last season, Gadecki was sidelined from an Australian Open wildcard spot this year for refusing vaccination protocols. The youngster was then knocked out of French Open qualifying this week, but Masur downplayed expectations of her being 'the next big thing', despite going from no ranking to 162 in the past two years. ""She's quite a priority in where we believe she can go,"" he said. ""Has she got game? Absolutely. She's powerful and strong. Almost like pre-requisite on the women's tour. She's technically sound. She's a great kid who played her heart out in 2021. ""We're a great tennis nation and obviously we'd like to stay there and there's a lot of work to do."" For now at least, the search is on to uncover the next Ash Barty, but when that will be poses more questions for Tennis Australia.

45,"Tokyo Olympic superstars Titmus, McKeown dominate Australian swimming championships",sport,"  Olympic gold medallists highlight their dominance at Australian swimming championships Dual Olympic gold medallist Ariarne Titmus has recorded the fastest time this year to win the women's 200m freestyle final at the Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide. Titmus's time of 1:53:31 was faster than her gold medal-winning time at the Tokyo Olympic Games and her second fastest time. The 100m champion Mollie O'Callaghan was second and Madison Wilson third. Titmus conceded breaking the world record set by Federica Pellegrini in 2009 during the supersuit era was in the back of her mind after her teammate broke the 200m breaststroke world record on Thursday night. ""It was, like after watching Zac (Stubblety-Cook) and hearing Zac speak, you know I said to him, 'I kind of feel the exact same way in my swimming at the moment' – very free, just enjoying like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders,"" she said. ""It's annoying when, like, your PB is this close to doing something great, but I think if you think about that you're not going to get it. ""I think it's definitely one of the more challenging world records,"" she said of Pellegrini's 2009 swim. ""Her back end in that race would have been insane — I think she had three suits on or something — so, even to be anywhere near that realm, I'm happy with the swim,"" Titmus said. Titmus said she didn't get back into training after the Olympics until December. ""I'm really proud of how I've handled it post-Olympics,"" she said. The Australian Swimming Championships are doubling as the trials for the world championships in Budapest in June and the Commonwealth Games in July. Titmus said she didn't think she would be swimming as fast as she is now but has decided not to contest the world championships, preferring to concentrate on the Commonwealth Games with a view to the Paris Olympics in 2024. Triple Olympic gold medallist Kaylee McKeown won the Women's 100m backstroke but couldn't threaten her own world record set last year. Her time of 58:49 was almost a second behind her time set at the Australian Olympic trials at the same pool. Mollie O'Callaghan came second, while Minna Atherton came third. Asked if she was happy with the swim, McKeown said, ""I don't know about that."" ""I think it's more just a bit of practice under my belt."" McKeown confirmed she will swim the 100m and 200m backstroke at the World Championship and will add the 400m individual medley at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. The women's 100m freestyle champion, 18-year-old Mollie O'Callaghan had an exceptional night coming second in both the 200m freestyle and the 100m backstroke. ""It's absolutely been crazy this meet, I didn't expect this much to happen so quick, but I'm really happy with the results so far,"" she said. She said she was getting pushed by Titmus and McKeown. ""I room with Kaylee, and I've gotten so close to the girls and it's so amazing to see how well they've done,"" she said. She plans to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle races at the world championships as well as the 100m backstroke. Zac Stubblety-Cook followed up his World Record in the men's 200m breaststroke by winning the 100m race, but said it wasn't easy sleeping afterwards. ""I got to sleep, I was pretty wrecked by the time I got home, and then like four o'clock I was like all of a sudden awake again – yeah, it was a bit surreal,"" he said. ""I think it was just the emotion of, like, actually sinking in of, like, what just happened, didn't just do a PB, but came fastest in the world ever, so it was like, holy shit."" Joshua Yong came second, and Samuel Williamson was third. In other results, Brendon Smith won the men's 200m individual medley final from Se-Bom Lee and Joshua Collett. Jenna Strauch won the women's 200m breaststroke final from Abbey Harkin and Taylor McKeown – Kaylee's older sister.

46,Relieved Blues hold off fast-finishing Swans to solidify top four spot,sport," Sport Carlton beat Sydney by 15 points as fast-finishing Swans give Blues a late scare Charlie Curnow has starred with six goals as Carlton survived a huge fightback to strengthen their grip on an AFL top-four spot with a 15-point win over Sydney. The Blues prevailed 15.12 (102) to 13.9 (87) at Docklands Stadium on Friday night in a contest between fourth and fifth on the ladder, sending a warning to the competition in the process. Despite injured spearhead Harry McKay's absence, their brutal scoring power was on full show in a nine-goal second quarter that broke the game open. But the Blues were forced to scrap as Sydney hit back, closing to within eight points late in the final term before Zac Fisher hacked through a steadying goal in time-on. Swans co-captain Josh Kennedy will face scrutiny over a high spoiling attempt on Sam Docherty, during which he tore his right hamstring. The clumsy effort split open Docherty's head, forcing the Blues defender off under the blood rule, and sparked a fierce melee as Carlton players rushed to remonstrate with Kennedy. He was sat on the ground nursing his injured leg and was eventually helped off the field by two trainers as jeers from Blues fans rained down from the stands. Curnow earned plaudits for a dazzling display in which he kicked five first-half goals and finished with the equal second-biggest haul of his 72-game career. The Blues' midfield was dominant in the first half, leading their side to a 89-58 advantage in contested possession, which was 161-137 in their favour at full-time. Sam Walsh (34 disposals), former Swans ball-winner George Hewett (32) and Patrick Cripps (19) were all influential, particularly before half-time, and Jacob Weitering was strong in defence opposed to Lance Franklin. Luke Parker (26 disposals), Isaac Heeney (24) and Callum Mills (22) helped drag Sydney back into the contest. Young tall Logan McDonald was a shining light in attack for the Swans, starting brightly and finishing with three goals, while Tom Papley also booted three majors for the visitors. Carlton laid just four tackles in the opening term but there were signs of the impending avalanche as they dominated contested possession (42-23). The home side cut Sydney's lead to one point with the final two goals of the first term, including one on the siren to Curnow. And the dam wall burst as the Blues piled on the first five goals of the second quarter before taking a 38-point advantage to the main break. Two Franklin goals helped spark Sydney during the third quarter as the midfield momentum shifted. Big marks from Weitering, Tom De Koning and Lachie Plowman in the final term helped Carlton hold the Swans at bay.

47,Tom Trbojevic injured as Paramatta come from behind to beat Manly,sport," Sport Tom Trbojevic injured as Paramatta come from behind to beat Manly 22-20 Tom Trbojevic's NRL season is in tatters after the superstar full-back suffered a dislocated shoulder in Manly's 22-20 loss to Parramatta. On a disastrous night for the Sea Eagles, Des Hasler's men finished with 12 men with Sean Keppie in the sin-bin as they let a 20-10 lead slip late. Mitch Moses was the hero for Parramatta, going from the bin himself earlier in the match to nailing a late conversion from the sideline to win it for the Eels. But it came on a bad evening for the Sea Eagles, NSW and the NRL as a whole with the potentially season-ending injury for the game's marquee man in Trbojevic. The Dally M Medallist was hurt when he dived back to challenge Marata Niukore to get to an Eels grubber, with Manly up 20-16 with 16 minutes to go. The full-back fell awkwardly on his left arm, dislocating his shoulder and immediately appearing in pain before being seen by three members of the medical staff. The 25-year-old left the field, with Manly weighing up whether to send him straight to hospital with the blow. The injury is Trbojevic's second of the year and comes just two-and-a-half-weeks out from the State of Origin series opener. It shapes as another blow for NSW coach Brad Fittler. The Blues are already without Latrell Mitchell, Ryan Papenhuyzen, Cameron Murray and Victor Radley, but Trbojevic's injury is the most crucial of the lot. Without him and with Keppie binned for a dangerous throw, Manly fought valiantly to hold on. They were also furious when winger Christian Tuipulotu was called for a high tackle on Hayze Perham, keeping Parramatta on the attack late. And when Isaiah Papali'i put Will Penisini over with three minutes to play, it allowed Moses to make the hero play from the sideline. Trbojevic had earlier played his best game of the season to help Manly to the lead. He had a role in two of Manly's tries, providing a nice pass for their opener when his quick hands helped Morgan Harper put Reuben Garrick over. Perham scored a double for Parramatta and Daly Cherry-Evans put Tuipulotu over with a brilliant cut-out ball, before Trbojevic was front and centre again after half-time. With the Eels down a man after Moses had pulled Trbojevic back on a break, the number one split Parramatta open with some nice footwork from within his own end. That allowed him to put Harper over, and when Garrick had his second try from a nice Foran grubber, the Sea Eagles were well in control at 20-10. But Parramatta would not go away, getting back in the game when Tom Opacic capped off some nice expansive play to score with 20 minutes to go. Trbojevic's injury then opened the door up for the Eels to pull off the win, putting a cloud over Manly's season in the process. The Wests Tigers survived a scare against Canterbury on Friday, inflicting more misery on the bottom-placed Bulldogs by claiming a 36-22 win. In front of 15,124 fans at Leichhardt Oval, the Tigers nearly threw away an 18-0 lead against a Canterbury side still reeling from coach Trent Barrett's exit from the club on Monday. Interim Canterbury coach Mick Potter will have been heartened by the second-half fightback to trail 18-16 but when Aaron Schoupp was sent to the sin bin for a dangerous throw in the 62nd minute everything unravelled for the Bulldogs. Even without Josh Addo-Carr (illness) and Brent Naden, who made a dramatic switch to the Tigers earlier this week, Canterbury scored more points on Friday than they have done in the previous 10 games under Barrett. Naden's first act as a Tigers player was to get hauled over the sideline and while his old Canterbury teammates smirked with delight, it was the new Tigers man who had the last laugh. On their first attacking set halfback Jackson Hastings steered the Tigers downfield before Joe Ofahengaue displayed some deft ballplaying to the left to have Luke Garner over the line with five minutes played. Hastings then set up fullback Starford To'a down the same side, with Ken Maumalo adding a double before the break to push the Tigers out to an 18-0 advantage. Within the space of five minutes, however, that lead had been cut to just six points. Matt Burton and Jeremy Marshall-King both crossed to haul the Bulldogs back into the fight after Hastings had been sinbinned for a professional foul. Winger Jacob Kiraz scored down the Canterbury left moments after Hastings returned to the field to cut the Tigers' lead to just two points and allow the Dogs to dream of an unlikely comeback. Any hope of that was distinguished when Aaron Schoupp lifted To'a above the horizontal and was sent to the sin bin. On the next set, Fa'amanu Brown barged his way over from close range in his first NRL game since 2019 and young Tigers half Jock Madden then extended their lead. Schoupp made amends with a late finish but by then the damage had been done. Brown added a second in the final minute of the game to ensure the Tigers' third win of the season.

48,"While the election race is almost over, this gruelling marathon is just beginning",sport,"  West Macs Monster ultramarathon running festival begins in Central Australia With the election race coming to a head, a gruelling race of a different kind is underway in Central Australia. More than 300 competitors have signed up to run different lengths of the famous Larapinta Trail in the three-day West Macs Monster festival this weekend. Individual runners and teams participating in the 231-kilometre ultramarathon 'Sonder Monster' event began running at 9am on Friday from Redbank Gorge. The race is not for the faint hearted, beginning with a 8km climb and a 740-metre elevation gain to the top of Mount Sonder. There is a cut-off time of 60 hours, with the record held by 2019 winner Shane Johnstone, who completed the run in 40 hours, 55 minutes and 18 seconds. Returning champion Elizabeth Woodgate, 58, said she wanted to shave two hours off her 2021 finishing time of 56 hours, 52 minutes and 2 seconds. ""You can tell people what it's going to be like ... but I think until you actually step foot onto that trail you just don't appreciate how tough it is and how remote it can be,"" she said. Last year, Ms Woodgate said she took just one 10 minute nap, but she was planning to run the race without sleeping this year. ""You start to experience sleep monsters — seeing things that aren't there,"" she said. ""You might look over on a ridge and you can see a building, or you can see people there. You know deep down inside that there is no building there and there are no people there, but to you they are quite real. ""I kind of lean into it a little bit and have a bit of fun with it."" Race director Marc Woods said about 30 per cent of the field across the five running events was made up of returning competitors. But because of heavy rains over Central Australia earlier this year, the track had changed considerably since last year. ""They're going to find sand where they used to find rocks, they're going to find rocks where they used to find sand and they're going to have lots more challenging conditions ... there are lots of ruts and washouts after all the rain,"" Mr Woods said. The second-longest event is the 128km race, starting from Ellery Creek on Saturday morning. The 65km event will start early on Sunday morning at Standley Chasm, and the popular 25km run from Simpsons Gap begins at midday on Sunday with about 180 competitors signed up to participate. This year marks the third full West Macs Monster festival, excluding a smaller version put on in 2020. ""What we tell everybody is that if they're looking for an experience that's beyond what they've ever done before — more rugged, or where they want a connection to country — there's a huge amount of spiritual connection to country that you get when spend so many hours on this event,"" Mr Woods said. ""Their sense of achievement after the effort that they have to put in to get through this is insurmountable.""

The news meant assistant Shelley Nitschke will take over for the interim, as the world's number one side prepares to head to the UK for a T20 International tri-series and the Commonwealth Games in July. The former Australian all-rounder has been working under Mott for the past four years and is the current coach of 2021 Women's Big Bash champions, the Perth Scorchers. During an international career that spanned from 2004 to 2011, Nitschke represented Australia at four World Cups and won trophies in both the 50-over (2005) and T20 (2010) formats. Nitschke was named the ICC Women's Cricketer of the Year in 2010 and won the Belinda Clark Award as Australia's best women's cricketer four years in a row, from 2009 through to 2012. Speaking with the ABC on the morning of the announcement of the team's Commonwealth Games squad, Nitschke said she was overjoyed by the opportunity. ""I'm just really grateful to have been given the opportunity, to be honest. Obviously it's an amazing team and it's been awesome to be a part of their journey over the last four years,"" she said. ""I never really envisaged as a player that I would go into coaching and it's a very different game now, so it's been wonderful to stay part of the game as it's gone through such a big transition. ""To get the chance to lead this side, I'm really quite honoured."" Mott's legacy leaves some huge shoes for Nitschke to fill in the coming months, after the team achieved a world record winning streak in ODI cricket (26 straight), clinched three World Cup titles, and have had a tight hold on the Women's Ashes trophy under his tenure. After seven years in charge, his departure makes way for a new era for the Australian team, with the opportunity to carry on down the same track or take a new path. Nitschke said it is more likely to be the former than the latter, given all she has learnt from Mott during their time together. ""We're certainly going to miss his nice and relaxed approach, the game plan he's set up and the relationships that he's built … I'd like to think that I can carry on what he's created and at times, add my spin on it, but I certainly think he's set everything up really well for us to have sustained success,"" she said. ""You won't be seeing any shake-ups, it's more of an element of 'if it's not broke, don't fix it', and I think one of the huge successes of this team is the way the playing group drives their values. ""There are certainly things that I'll put my spin on and do a little bit differently as a person, and we'll reassess things as we go, but there certainly won't be major changes."" One thing the team have never had the opportunity to do is to win a gold medal, but with women's T20 cricket being added to the schedule at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, the team have set their sights on another accolade. Nitschke said the sport's introduction at the Games would help take it even further on the world stage and that she was looking forward to working alongside the other national teams in the Australian Commonwealth Games group. ""It's really exciting for us, it's something completely different. It's obviously going to get the global game pushed forward some more for people to see,"" Nitschke said. ""To be over there with other athletes and Australian teams is something really new to us, and the group is really excited about it, we can't wait."" Mott is not only well-respected in the cricket community, but is well-liked for his happy-go-lucky personality, with his laid-back and warm approach as a coach. All-rounder Ash Gardner said Nitschke's personality was pretty similar, which should help the transition period under her watch go smoothly. ""She's great to have around,"" Gardner said. ""Shelley is always up for a joke, which is something that keeps you grounded, but she's not afraid to tell you the truths that you may not want to hear, and sometimes as players you need that. ""Even when you look at her playing record, she was so good back in her day … she didn't win all the Belinda Clarks and ICC medals for no reason."" The pair share a special bond after a tumultuous trip to India in 2016 with the national Indigenous women's team, where Nitschke was coach and Gardner was the captain. Nitschke is the likely front-runner for the permanent role and if the team are able to bring home gold, that might just seal the deal. But Gardner said the opening is likely to draw the attention of some big-name candidates. ""I would assume that both assistants, Ben Sawyer – who I've had a lot to do with at the Sixers and actually coached me in the U18s – as well as Nitschke would fill the job nicely,"" she said. ""In saying that, I know how much interest this job will get, considering we've been one of the most successful Australian sides in history, so I think that's going to attract some exciting options and I'm keen to see who we get. ""If it was to end up being Shelley or Ben, I know none of us will be complaining."" The Australian women's team will play the T20 international tri-series against Pakistan and Ireland from July 16, before making the trip to Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games where they'll begin their campaign on July 29.

50,AFL announces 2022 grand final start time after two years of evening matches,sport," Sport 2022 AFL grand final start time to return to 2:30pm slot after talk of twilight match The AFL has announced the 2022 grand final will start at 2:30pm on Saturday, September 24. There had been some talk that the game would move to a twilight match, after the 2020 and 2021 matches played in Brisbane and Perth were held later than the traditional slot. ""Prior to the start of this season, we emphasised that after two really challenging years, we all yearned to return to the footy rituals and routines that set the rhythms of our lives, to continue to focus on getting back to football and going to football as we know it,"" AFL chief executive officer Gillon McLachlan said. ""That return-to-rituals principle underpinned our decision making in ratifying a traditional start time — the prestige, nostalgia and atmosphere of the day grand final is something we all know and love."" Speculation around the match moving to a later slot had gathered momentum in recent weeks, after the 2020 match was held at 6:30pm local time in Brisbane, while the 2021 match was held at 5.15pm local time in Perth. Due to COVID restrictions, the 2022 grand final will be the first to be held at the MCG since Richmond defeated the GWS Giants by 89 points in 2019.

51,Jordan Thompson to face clay king Rafael Nadal first as Aussies learn French Open fate,sport,"  Jordan Thompson draws Rafael Nadal in French Open as Aussies learn their first-round fate at Roland Garros Australian Jordan Thompson has been handed one of sport's cruellest assignments: playing Rafael Nadal in his clay-court kingdom at Roland Garros. Nadal is seeking to regain the French Open title he has won 13 times, with Sydneysider Thompson being the first hurdle in the Spaniard's path at Roland Garros, doubtless on his ""home"" Court Philippe Chatrier. Thursday's draw has thrown up for Thompson what could be any player's dream — or nightmare — assignment, but the 28-year-old will surely savour the prospect of battle against the greatest clay-courter in history. They have met once before, also in Paris, on the indoor hard court at Bercy in the Masters, with Nadal coming out on top 6-1, 7-6 (7/3). But Nadal has suffered an untimely recurrence of his foot injury in the build-up to this year's Open, meaning this could be the best time for any contenders to catch the 35-year-old at a venue where he's lost just three times in 108 matches, most recently in last year's epic semi-final with champion Novak Djokovic. Indeed, Thompson can take some encouragement from having reached the third round at Roland Garros three years ago — the best performance by any Australian man in recent times. Countryman Alexei Popyrin knows what it is like to face Nadal in a Roland Garros opener, having lost to the Spaniard in straight sets last year. This time, Popyrin has got a less high-profile but still potentially volcanic affair waiting in the unpredictable shape of Italian Fabio Fognini. Meanwhile, Australian number one Alex de Minaur's preparation for Roland Garros continues apace, reaching the semi-final of the Lyon Open on Friday after his opponent retired injured. It is the Australia's second clay-court semi-final in the space of a month, following his brilliant last-four contest in Barcelona with eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz, where the Sydneysider was beaten after holding match point against the Spanish wunderkind. De Minaur has landed French opponent Hugo Gaston, the world number 68, in his first round. If he makes it past the dangerous left-hander, the number 19 seed will then take on a qualifier in the next round before a potential third-round clash, most likely with Canada's Denis Shapovalov, or the new Danish Rune Holger. Thanasi Kokkinakis could enjoy the dubious pleasure of a second-round meeting with Alcaraz if he can defeat Spanish grinder Albert Ramos-Vinolas first up. John Millman has been given a huge task to tame rising American 27th seed Sebastian Korda in his opener, while the ever-resilient James Duckworth, who is just embarking on yet another comeback after the ninth bout of surgery in his career, has a winnable tie against Swede Mikael Ymer. Jason Kubler meets a fellow qualifier. Top Australian women's hope Ajla Tomljanovic, who suffered a thigh injury at the Morocco Open on Thursday, would surely have preferred a much kinder start than having to face Estonian fifth seed Anett Kontaveit when the tournament kicks off on Sunday. Finally, wildcard Daria Saville has landed a qualifier, while Astra Sharma, who was also knocked out in Morocco on Thursday, faces Russian Varvara Gracheva.

The 29-year-old played 126 games and kicked 153 goals after debuting for the Bombers in 2016. The small forward left the club after Round 21 last season for personal reasons. He has not played a game at AFL level since. ""The Bombers gave me the opportunity to fulfil my dream of playing AFL,"" McDonald-Tipungwuti said via a club statement. ""I have loved my time at the club and I am so proud of what I have been able to achieve in my AFL career. I am also proud of my education, coming to Victoria was to pursue my education and that has been really important for me too. ""The club and my teammates have been extremely supportive throughout my whole career but I feel really happy to be moving on to the next chapter of my life now. I'm ready for life beyond football. ""I wish all the boys the best for their future, I'll be watching on from afar."" McDonald-Tipungwuti was raised on the Tiwi Islands until he was 17, before moving to Victoria to live with his adoptive family to finish his education and play football for the Gippsland Power. After missing on being drafted to the AFL, McDonald-Tipungwuti joined Essendon's VFL club, Bendigo, and was eventually drafted at pick 22 in the 2015 rookie draft. Essendon's executive general manager of football Josh Mahoney said McDonald-Tipungwuti had been an incredible role model for the game. ""Anthony has been a truly wonderful person to have at the club for the past seven years and we are a better football club to have had him within our four walls,"" Mahoney said. ""Anthony is an incredible role model and his contribution to this game has been profound. ""We've been working incredibly closely to support Anthony over nearly the past 12 months in dealing with his personal matters, and while we will miss his brilliance on the field, we accept and support his decision knowing his ultimate happiness is the utmost priority to all. This is the best decision for Anthony as a person.

53,North Queensland have been the surprise packet of 2022 – now they'll be put to the ultimate test,sport," Sport Campo's Corner: We're about to find out if North Queensland are for real When it comes to the NRL premiership, right now there's Penrith and there's Melbourne and somewhere in the back is everybody else. Don't be fooled by the damp squib the two runaway leaders served up at Magic Round, where the Panthers arrived locked and loaded and the Storm kept their powder dry. They are still the class of this competition, the twin suns around which the rest of the league is in constant orbit. There's only one way to join this very exclusive club and that's by beating one of the existing members. Even if you crash to a loss the following week, like Parramatta did against the Roosters barely seven days after they lowered Penrith's colours, it's a piece of street cred not soon forgotten. That's what North Queensland, the surprise packets of the 2022 season, are playing for over the next fortnight, when they ride the lightning and take on both of the top two. Through ten rounds, the Cowboys have earned curiosity from the many who tipped them to finish in the doldrums yet again, now it's time to see if they can win some attention. The numbers are strong for Todd Payten's side. They're sitting in third spot, having won five in a row. In their last four games they've scored 30 points or more, and through the entire season they've conceded just 125 points, which is fewer than any other team bar Penrith. But the stats only tell half the story. This is a team playing with swagger, with a fearsome certainty that there is a vibe around the place right now. Chad Townsend, the most maligned purchase of the off-season, is playing his best football in years and Tom Dearden, who plenty were ready to throw on the scrap heap at 19, is proving why there were so many wraps on him as a schoolboy. Murray Taulagi is throwing passes we don't have names for. Prop forward Reuben Cotter is running 60 metres to score tries while dummying to nobody. Backrower Jeremiah Nanai has scored eight tries, all of them off kicks, all of them with a nose for the ball that would bring a tear to Matt Sing's eye. After two years where he looked mortal due to broken hands and rule changes, Jason Taumalolo is once again looking like that old strength which could move earth and heaven. But the one Cowboy who sums up what the club has fast become is fullback Scott Drinkwater. The 25-year old is as gifted a creative attacking player as there is in the NRL – his speed, footwork, kicking game and ability to play both within and outside structure make him dangerous all over the field, while his left to right cut-out pass is nice enough to take home and introduce to the family. Those qualities have always existed within Drinkwater. The Storm know it better than most, because it was at the Storm where he was originally earmarked as Billy Slater's long-term replacement. He was that classic Melbourne story – a junior they scouted and stashed in the Queensland Cup for seasoning, hidden away north of the border from all but the keenest eyes. Drinkwater won the starting fullback job in the 2019 pre-season after Slater's retirement, but tore his pectoral muscle in a trial game and missed half the year. He was replaced by Jahrome Hughes, who played so well he was shoehorned into halfback once Ryan Papenhuyzen's name had gone from difficult to pronounce to up in bright lights, and the horse had pretty much bolted. The other player to slot in at fullback for Melbourne that year was Nicho Hynes. These days, that's three of the biggest names in the game, who have had so much happen to them with plaudits and premierships and contracts so big they make your head spin. All of that could have happened to Drinkwater, if he hadn't had some bad luck at the worst time, and with the path to first grade so crowded once he returned he transferred north to Townsville, where he split time between the halves and fullback for the next two seasons. Drinkwater's attack remained strong once he headed north – he won Player of the Tournament honours at the Perth Nines in 2020 – but defensive issues stopped him from hitting true NRL stardom. He wasn't even in the team to begin this season. Hamsio Tabuai-Fidow was preferred at fullback until injury opened the door for Drinkwater to line up at fullback once again, and his return coincided with the Cowboys transforming into what they have become. Townsend is a workmanlike and intelligent half, a product of his long experience at the top level, Dearden is feisty and clever, hooker Reece Robson is quite possibly the most underrated player in the NRL, but Drinkwater provides the touch of class that makes the Cowboys rise above the teams they've dispatched in recent weeks. If this is the moment it happens for Drinkwater, if this current run of form is not just another good patch but a transition from good first-grader to something more than that, there are few limits to what he can achieve. But to be one of those guys you can't just do it against the rest, it must also happen when you take on the best. Drinkwater comes full circle this weekend when the Cowboys play Melbourne on Saturday and for an added twist, have a guess who the Storm were playing against when he tore his pec and lost the jersey he'd rightfully won? It was, of course, the Cowboys. You can poke holes in Payten's team if you really try. They've lost to the Bulldogs and Warriors this year. They have that brutalising win over Parramatta, a 35-4 belting in the Northern Territory heat which was quickly forgotten when the Eels beat Penrith the following week, but their only other game against the current top six came when they lost badly to a Roosters side that was still finding their own way. But that defeat, plus the two earlier losses, was before Drinkwater came back into the side, before everything changed, before they saddled up for what is increasingly look like a ride to the top four. So this is where we are. This is the time to find out. The Storm might be missing Papenhuyzen and Reimis Smith and Nelson Asofa-Solomona, but they are still favourites because they are the Storm, a champion side even when they don't win the title. It is time for the Cowboys to go big-game hunting, and if they end up with the Storm's head on their mantle they won't be a surprise packet anymore, there will be no more ambushes, they'll go through the rest of the year knowing they matched it with the best and teams will circle them on the calender. They won't get a better chance than this to prove their mettle, to themselves and the wider football world. Apart from Melbourne's absences, this one is at North Queensland Stadium, where the fans show up in droves even in the tough times, so when times are good the seats sell faster than a cold beer on a humid Townsville afternoon. As of Thursday, 21,500 punters have already snapped up a ticket. This is a fanbase who has been out of the finals for five years and have never really had a premiership contender on their hands without Johnathan Thurston being involved. They never stop believing, but now they're ready to start winning. Next week will be a different case altogether. Winter has come to New South Wales, Penrith is colder than anywhere else in Sydney and going into the screaming black hole of madness out at Panthers Stadium is an easy to way to finish a night battered, bruised, beaten and feeling bad about yourself. But if the Cowboys beat the Storm and look good doing it, North Queensland vs Penrith becomes a top of the table clash, first vs second, and maybe we'll get that game of the year we thought would happen at Magic Round. Maybe two really can turn into three. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

54,Cricket Australia names its women's Commonwealth Games squad,sport," Sport Cricket Australia announces Commonwealth Games women's cricket squad Cricket Australia has this morning announced its 15-player women's squad heading to the United Kingdom in July, for the T20 International Tri-Series in Northern Ireland and the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. The side remains unchanged after its ICC World Cup victory last month, as Amanda-Jade Wellington and Grace Harris retain their places in the squad, which features five spinners and five seam bowlers. Superstar all-rounder Ellyse Perry is expected to play purely as a batter on the trip at this stage, as she recovers from a stress fracture in her lower back. Perry missed two matches at the World Cup with soreness, before making a return for the final against England in the same capacity. Fans will be excited to see Alyssa Healy back in action, after the explosive batter was named as both player of the final and the tournament for her 170 runs in the decider and 509 total runs for the tournament. Alongside Rachael Haynes, Australia's opening pair were the top two run scorers at the 50-over World Cup, amassing more than 1,000 runs between them. But the switch to the shorter format will now see Beth Mooney re-join Healy at the top of the order. The trip will also mark a changing of the guard for the Australian coaching staff, with former all-rounder Shelley Nitchske taking over as the interim head coach after Matthew Mott's departure to coach England's men's limited-overs teams. Women's T20 cricket is due to make its debut at the Games on July 29 and the top-ranked Australian team is set to face India, Barbados and Pakistan in Group A. The top two countries in each group will then progress to the semi-finals, playing for a spot in the bronze and gold medal matches held on August 7. As the current holders of both the one-day and T20 World Cup, with recent multi-format series victories against India (October 2021) and England (February 2022), Australia will be the favourites to challenge for gold. The side will also get a sneak preview of what to expect from Pakistan in the weeks leading up to the Games when they face the seventh-ranked side alongside Ireland in a T20 tri-series in Northern Ireland. Each team will play each other twice in the series spanning from July 16-23 at the Bready Cricket Club in Derry. Australia's head of performance and national selector Shawn Flegler said the tri-series should help the team adjust to the northern hemisphere conditions. ""This series is an important part of the team's preparation for the Games, and we are grateful for the support from Commonwealth Games Australia that has allowed this to happen,"" Flegler said. ""It's exciting to see the women's game feature at the Commonwealth Games for the first time, it's going to be a historic occasion and one we're all looking forward to. ""The two series also present Shelley Nitschke with a great opportunity to lead the side. We're in a fortunate position to have some world-class coaches in our system, with both Shelley and assistant coach Ben Sawyer contributing to the team's success over the last few years."" The team's physiotherapist, Kate Beerworth, said injured bowlers Tayla Vlaeminck and Georgia Wareham were progressing well in their rehab, but neither would feature at the Games. Vlaeminck has been working with The Australian Ballet to try and speed up her return to play.

55,Australian star Cameron Smith starts well in US PGA with birdie masterclass,sport," Sport US PGA Championship: Cameron Smith starts in Tulsa as Rory McIlroy takes the early lead Cameron Smith has delivered a ball-striking masterclass to live up to his billing as one of the favourites for the US PGA Championship in Oklahoma. Smith posted a birdie-filled two-under-par 68 to trail clubhouse leader Rory McIlroy by three shots after his first round at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa. Australia's world number four leads the PGA Tour for birdies this season, with an average of 5.38 a round. And he led the field on Thursday, too, with seven more birdies, all coming from inside three metres. ""I really like the golf course. I hit my driver really good today, which freed me up into the greens, and was able to make a few birdies there on the back nine,"" Smith said. ""Just need to keep hitting fairways. My irons and putting feels really good, just keep those birdie looks coming."" Smith also missed three putts from between seven and 10 feet. But his back-nine blitz of five birdies in seven holes at least saved The Players champion from shooting over par after he reached the turn at two-over. Smith was in a tie for sixth when he completed his round. McIlroy was alone on top at five-under, the former world number one and four-time major champion holding a one-shot lead over Smith's playing partner, Will Zalatoris, and fellow American Tom Hoge. Matt Kuchar and Abraham Ancer were sharing fourth after firing three-under 67s. Veteran John Daly also caught the attention of the crowd, sitting two shots off the lead for almost an hour of play, before fading to go two-over. Starting on the 10th, Smith could barely believe he missed a birdie start after his putt hung over the lip of the hole. He waited as long as he could but the ball would not drop, and he had to settle for par before rebounding with a birdie on the 11th with a laser approach to the par three. But after missing the fairway right off the tee on 12, Smith went from rough to rough to card a dreaded double bogey and give up two shots. He birdied with the par-five 13th to return to even par, only to drop successive shots on 16 and 17. Smith's brilliant fightback began with three consecutive birdies to open his inward nine and surge back into red figures. Forced to lay up on the par-five fifth after finding a fairway off the tee, Smith produced the shot of the day to set up his sixth and most unlikely birdie, almost holing out for eagle from 215 yards. He picked up another shot on the seventh to climb to three-under, only to drop a shot on the brutal par-three eighth after finding a trap and being unable to get up and down. Australia's two other morning starters — Cam Davis (72) and Matt Jones (73) — were seven and eight shots behind McIlroy, respectively. Former champion Jason Day, Adam Scott, Marc Leishman, Min Woo Lee and Lucas Herbert all had afternoon tee times.

56,Fans storm the pitch as Everton escape Premier League relegation with dramatic Palace win,sport,"  Fans flood the pitch as Everton escape Premier League relegation with dramatic 3-2 win over Crystal Palace Dominic Calvert-Lewin has scored five minutes from time to guarantee Everton's Premier League survival as the side rallied from two goals down to secure a thrilling 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace. Everton needed a win at a rocking Goodison Park on Friday morning to ensure they continued their 68-year top-flight stay. And Calvert-Lewin, who had been a peripheral figure this season due to injury, came through, sparking a pitch invasion after heading home a Demarai Grey free-kick five minutes from full-time to win the game. It will be huge relief for manager Frank Lampard and Everton's vociferous fans, who provided another massive show of support ahead of the game as they welcomed the team to the stadium, but had been deflated after a poor first half. Everton move to 39 points from 37 games, four clear of relegation rivals Burnley and Leeds United, which ensures they go into Sunday's final game of the season against Champions League-chasing Arsenal with the pressure on them since January now off. A second pitch invasion at the final whistle turned the air blue again as the Everton fans lit flares, the relief around the ground palpable and the party likely to go long into the night. Palace went ahead after 21 minutes when Eberechi Eze's free kick was met by Jean-Philippe Matete with a simple headed finish as Everton's set-piece woes were on show again. Jordan Ayew was fortunate not to receive a red card after a crunching tackle on Anthony Gordan only drew yellow, and then minutes later scored the second goal for the visitors. It was a setback of Everton's own making as captain Seamus Coleman lost the ball on the halfway line. As Palace broke into the home side's box, a mix-up between goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and Vitali Mykolenko allowed Wilfred Zaha to fire at goal, the ball ricocheting into the net off Ayew after 36 minutes. However, Everton started the second half much brighter and pulled a goal back through Michael Keane as he collected Mason Holgate's header in the box and scored with a left foot shot from 10 metres in the 67th. Pickford saved well from Mateta but Everton kept pressing and found a second goal through Brazilian striker Richarlison, who scuffed a shot into the far corner of the net with 15 minutes left after substitute Dele Alli's initial shot was blocked. The home fans roared Everton forward in search of a vital third and Calvert-Lewin, a player who has drawn some criticism for his perceived poor performances in recent weeks, came up with their magic moment to send Goodison Park wild. Lampard hailed the win a ""special night"" in Everton's history. ""At half-time, we are not dead and buried, but anyone on the outside would say that and it is the character of this club, the fans and the players that dragged us through,"" he told Sky Sports afterwards. ""The spirit of the club was immense … namely the players, the board, and my staff. It is a huge night for Everton and now we want to take that forward.""

It was a long way back for Pedro after almost four years on the sidelines after a series of knee injuries which began in his loss to the legendary Mauricio ""Shogun"" Rua in December 2018. Pedro freely admits he didn't just lose his way during his long sabbatical, he lost himself. Even when he was healthy enough to return to the Octagon, he almost didn't do it. ""There was just times where my family was unhappy with me, I was self-sabotaging, even if I stuck to training I wasn't being the best version of myself,"" Pedro said. ""As soon as the fight was announced there was almost a full panic attack, and I did the same thing, I self-sabotaged. ""My family didn't want me to fight, it was too much. But I realised what that feeling was – I was scared it was finally real after so long, there was too much emotion. ""But once that cleared I was in kill mode, and I've never felt better. The win didn't mean so much as getting in there and proving to myself I could fight at this level. ""When you're in a hole you don't know you're in a hole until you come out of it."" Now Pedro is back, and he's aiming straight for the top. He didn't stay idle during his absence – Pedro launched Drink West, the beer he owns with fellow UFC fighter Tai Tuivasa, and he'll be part of the ABC's That Pacific Sports Show as a reporter when it returns to the air in June. But Pedro still knows what he wants more than anything else. He's keen on returning to the cage as soon as possible, and is hoping to fight on the Paris card in September, which rumour has it will be headlined by Tuivasa's bumper clash with former heavyweight title challenger Ciryl Gane. Pedro believes he was brought on too quickly in his initial UFC run, with his inexperience contributing to some of his losses where he'd often dominate early before losing his way. Tai Tuivasa is so close to a UFC title shot he can almost taste it — and a win over Ciryl Gane in France could well push the Australian over the top in the fight for championship gold. He's a different fighter now and is constantly improving, with sessions under City Kickboxing coach Eugene Bareman, who has helped Israel Adesanya and Alex Volkanovski claim UFC titles, putting the finishing touches on his strong all-round game. At just 30, Pedro is a young man in an old division and can see a clear path to the top of the light-heavyweight. ""I need to build up and then fight the best guys – even though I know I'm a completely different person, and that this version of myself doesn't lose some of those fights and some of them were close, some of the stuff I was doing was kind of amateurish because I'd rush,"" he said. ""But that comes from wisdom, from learning, and I'm ready for it now. ""There's some great fighters, but the division is open. There's a chance for someone to drive straight through. ""I want to take it slow, but you get two hot wins in a row and they say 'f**k it' and you're taking on ranked fighters and I'm always going to take a tough fight. ""That hasn't always worked for me in the past, but I think it will this time.""

58,Six female referees chosen for men's FIFA World Cup in historic first,sport,"  Six women chosen to referee at men's FIFA World Cup for the first time Female referees will make football history this year after being chosen by FIFA to officiate at a men's World Cup for the first time. Three centre referees and three assistant referees were announced on Thursday by the governing body for November's tournament among 129 officials selected for Qatar. French referee Stephanie Frappart has already worked men's games in World Cup qualifying and the Champions League, after handling the 2019 Women's World Cup final. She also refereed the final of the men's French Cup this month between OGC Nice and FC Nantes. ""As always, the criteria we have used is 'quality first', and the selected match officials representing the highest level of refereeing worldwide,"" FIFA referees committee chairman Pierluigi Collina, who worked the 2002 World Cup final, said. ""In this way, we clearly emphasise that it is quality that counts for us and not gender."" Rwanda's Salima Mukansanga and Yoshimi Yamashita of Japan are also on the list of 36 referees preparing for the 64-game tournament, which will be played from November 21 to December 18. The 69 assistant referees include Brazil's Neuza Back, Karen Diaz Medina of Mexico, and American Kathryn Nesbitt. ""I would hope that, in the future, the selection of elite women's match officials for important men's competitions will be perceived as something normal and no longer as sensational,"" Collina said. The extreme heat in Qatar led FIFA to decide in 2015 to move the tournament to the cooler months in the Gulf emirate. FIFA has picked 24 men to work on video reviews. The VAR system made its debut in 2018. FIFA said 50 referee-and-assistant trios began preparing in 2019 for World Cup duty, with the project affected by limits on international travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. A-League Men centre referee Chris Beath, assistants Ashley Beecham and Anton Shchetinin, and VAR official Shaun Evans will represent Australia in Qatar. All the officials – who were not allocated into specific teams of three – face future technical, physical, and medical assessments this year, FIFA said.

59,'You can't make me out to be the villain': Kyle Chalmers backflip could cost Cody Simpson,sport," Sport Kyle Chalmers considers backflip, Zac Stubblety-Cook breaks world record in 200m breaststroke at Australian Swimming Championships Olympic freestyle gold medallist Kyle Chalmers dropped a bombshell, saying he is considering swimming at the World Championships, which would deprive pop sensation Cody Simpson of a spot on the team. Chalmers opened up to the media about the physical and mental pain he has suffered in recent months after winning the Men's 50m butterfly event at the Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide. On Wednesday, Chalmers came second and Simpson third in the 100m butterfly, behind Olympian Matthew Temple. Chalmers had previously said he was not going to swim at the World Championships in Budapest this June. That decision opened the door for Simpson's incredible comeback to the pool after pursuing a successful, decade-long career in music. But Chalmers said his form has surprised him and butterfly swimming is his first love, prompting a re-think about the World Championships. ""Well, you can't make me out to be the villain, right,"" Chalmers said if he does decide to compete, potentially robbing Simpson of a spot. ""Unfortunately, I started out as a butterflyer and I've been swimming, I've been on the team now for 8 years, I've watched the 100 butterfly from afar and always wanted to do it, my body hasn't allowed me to do it to this point. ""For me, I have to have a serious sit-down with my coach [Peter Bishop] and my team around me and have that discussion over the next couple of days. ""Personally I think it's [swimming at the World Championships] going to be the best thing for me moving forward because I know my coach, my squad go to Europe, I'll be left here by myself training by myself. ""Obviously I look at my preparation eight weeks ago, I wasn't in the pool at all, potentially not going to swim at all this year, potentially maybe never swim again ""My shoulders were in a whole lot of pain. ""I've given everything I possibly can to this sport over this past five-year period, mentally, physically, emotionally and was just extremely burnt out."" He said a holiday to Noosa with a friend prompted him to decide that if he was going to swim again, he would do the butterfly. ""Just to take that pressure and expectation of myself,"" he said. ""I'm a perfectionist, I love swimming PBs, not only in racing but every time I jump in the pool to train so for me I find it very hard when I'm not in shape. ""It's been a quick progression. I think it would have been very disrespectful for myself to stand there eight weeks ago and say I'm going to be at the World Championships swimming butterfly."" He said the final decision on swimming at the World Championships would be made with a view to the 2024 Olympic Games. ""I want to swim butterfly long course, I want to swim the 100 butterfly in Paris,"" he said. Chalmers opened up about the enormous pressure he said he'd been feeling recently, saying he told his coach recently that he just wanted to go home. ""Every time I stand behind the blocks, there's so much pressure and expectation on me — obviously the media doesn't help that either — I can't just do my own thing and race how I want to do now,"" he said. Asked why he keeps going after enduring so much physical pain from multiple shoulder operations as well as mental anguish he replied: ""What else do I have?"" ""You do it for the love of it. ""I've gone through so much physical pain especially over these last two and a half years."" He revealed he recently ripped some bone off his ankle. ""For me it's about becoming comfortable being uncomfortable,"" he said. ""It's about dealing with these issues, dealing with the injuries, dealing with the setbacks — the mental side of things. ""People like to look at us as perfect humans but unfortunately we're the same as everyone else … we're not some robots. ""It's not just train and have fun and enjoy it, it's a whole lot of physical, mental and emotional setbacks to get to that point and it's why I love racing."" Olympic gold medallist Zac Stubblety-Cook smashed the World Record in the Men's 200m breaststroke final at the Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide. His time of 2:05.95 was 0.17 seconds under the old record held by Anton Chupkov of Russia, making him the first man in history to break the 2:06 barrier. Stubblety-Cook won gold in the event at the Tokyo Olympic Games. ""I always had the goal in the back of my mind to be the first guy to go 2:05 and you don't get many opportunities and tonight was one of them,"" he said after the race ""It's a bit surreal, to be perfectly honest. ""Doesn't feel real yet, hasn't really sunk in. Probably sink in over the next few days, still got a few jobs to do before then."" ""I was obviously hoping to swim fast and hoping to swim close to my best and that's just something else."" Stubblety-Cook said he was driven by process, not outcomes. ""I've thought about it and tried to be around that process but never kind of be like yeah, that's it, like I want to break a world record, but you know it happens,"" the understated swimmer said. Matthew Wilson, who finished third, led out the race in fast time, allowing Stubblety-Cook to power home. ""Felt pretty good at the hundred so I knew I could bring it home, but yeah, I didn't think we were going fast."" Triple Olympic gold medallist, Kaylee McKeown also had a revelation after winning the 400m Individual Medley in a world class time of 4:31.74. McKeown won two individual backstroke gold medals as well as a relay gold medal in Tokyo but has revealed she'd probably swim the 400 IM at the World Championships as well as her pet strokes — the 100m and 200m backstroke. ""It's definitely going to be a hard year to kind of choose what I'm going to do and at the same time it's the year to do it,"" she said. McKeown said her coach, Michael Bohl, would allow her to make the final decision on whether to swim the 400m Individual medley When pushed on whether she wanted to, she replied: ""Do I? No, but will I? Yes."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

60,Baffling bunker call cruels Newcastle's chances in heavy loss to Brisbane,sport," Sport Baffling video referee decision cruels Newcastle's hopes in heavy loss to Brisbane Brisbane were made to fight for a fifth-straight NRL win as they claimed a controversial 36-12 victory over Newcastle. In front of a crowd of 13,312 at McDonald Jones Stadium on Thursday night, Brisbane were the beneficiaries of two bunker calls either side of the halftime break which are likely to leave the Knights incensed. The first came when Newcastle centre Dane Gagai juggled the ball attempting to score in the first half with the Origin representative adjudicated to have lost the ball. The second came when the game was delicately poised at 14-12 with Selwyn Cobbo scoring after Jordan Riki had appeared to obstruct Knights halfback Adam Clune in the build-up. Newcastle coach Adam O'Brien could be seen going ballistic from the coaches box after Cobbo's try was awarded. Cobbo backed up a Kotoni Staggs break and from there the Broncos pulled away to continue their unbeaten run — the longest since the 2017 season. The victory was made all the more impressive by the fact they were without halfback Adam Reynolds due to a groin complaint. The game was also Anthony Milford's first since leaving Brisbane and being stood down by the NRL before signing for the Knights. Milford showed no signs of ring rust and his kicking game troubled his old club at times. Without Reynolds, Brisbane were forced to deploy debutant playmaker Ezra Mam in the halves alongside Tyson Gamble. Mam had a moment to forget when he failed to deal with a Clune grubber and Knights forward Tyson Frizell gleefully picked the ball up to score the opener with 10 minutes played. The youngster soon made amends down the other end when he managed to sneak a late offload away for Billy Walters to burrow over for his first try in Broncos colours. Newcastle forward Lachlan Fitzgibbon dropped one over the line and Gagai's try was questionably chalked off to leave the sides locked at 6-6 at the break. Just five minutes into the second half, Brisbane hit the front foot with Gamble sending Riki over unchallenged with a deft assist. Kalyn Ponga hit back for the hosts but any hope was shortlived when they lost Bradman Best to an elbow injury and Cobbo went over for his first. From there the damn burst with Corey Oates, Cobbo and Herbie Farnworth all crossing in the last 10 minutes to slant the scoreline in Brisbane's favour.

61,"AFLW players receive 94 per cent pay rise, new season to start in August",sport," Sport New CBA sees AFLW players receive 94 per cent pay rise with season set to start in August The AFL and AFL Players Association have agreed on a one-year collective bargaining agreement that will see the next AFLW season begin in August this year, while the players will also receive a significant boost in salary. Across the board, average player salaries will increase by 94 per cent, with the minimum salary increasing to $39,184 per season up from $20,239 last year. The best-paid players — of which there are two per club — will receive $71,935, up from $37,155. Tier three and two players will receive $47,372 and $55,559 respectively, up from $24,468 and $28,697 last season. Season seven will kick off on the last weekend of August, which is the week of the AFL men's pre-finals bye. The length of the season — which had been a point of contention for the players — will stay at 10 home and away rounds but add an additional week to the finals series. The players had been pushing hard for an expansion of the competition beyond 10 rounds, but the AFL would not agree to extend the season length. Instead, with all 18 clubs in the competition, the revamped finals series will now include the top eight sides, rather than the top six, and run over four weeks instead of three. The length of the deal is much shorter than the previous collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which ran for three years, but enables the new season to start in August. It will now expire at the same time as the AFL men's CBA, but it is not yet known whether the players will negotiate their next CBA together. Frustration had been growing from players, clubs and fans at the lack of certainty over the new season, including pre-season start dates, expansion and trade periods and the AFLW draft. Clubs will now start pre-season training in just a few weeks, on June 13. The expansion signing period, meanwhile, will commence on May 24, the sign and trade period on May 31 and the AFLW draft will be held on June 29. Players had also been increasingly frustrated about the amount of unpaid overtime they were undertaking, having previously been contracted for just 15 hours per week and in-season only. The new deal sees total player payments — including base salaries and prize money — jump to $25.6 million from $10.6 million in the previous season, an increase of 146 per cent. Adelaide's third AFLW premiership may be their most meaningful, as it came at the end of a season that challenged the club, and the league, more than any other, writes Kate O'Halloran. AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan thanked everyone for their patience over the delay in announcing the CBA. ""We appreciate everyone's patience, especially the players and clubs over the last few weeks, and that patience has resulted in a great agreement for both the players and the broader industry,"" McLachlan said. ""The agreement represents a landmark improvement in pay for AFLW players and an historic level of investment in domestic women's sport. ""[It] is a giant step forward in achieving our vision of ensuring AFLW players are the best-paid female athletes in any local professional competition by 2030."" The USA is the first nation to equalise World Cup prize money between men and women athletes, but it doesn't address the root cause of the problem. Paul Marsh, CEO of the AFL Players Association (AFLPA), also lauded the agreement, while reiterating the association's position that players should be made professional sooner. ""This agreement is the first step toward our vision of AFLW players being full-time footballers by 2026,"" Marsh said. ""This CBA acknowledges the important role the AFLW players have and instils great confidence in the future direction of the competition. ""Through this process, the players have been united in their vision of what is important for the future. There has been a high level of engagement, which speaks to how much the players care about AFLW and its long-term position on the sporting landscape. ""The players are thrilled with this CBA and the outcome speaks to the belief we all have in the future of AFLW."" The most recent season concluded on April 9, when Adelaide won its third AFLW premiership, beating Melbourne in the grand final. Four new clubs — Essendon, Hawthorn, Port Adelaide and Sydney — will enter the AFLW next season, making it an 18-team competition.

62,US Soccer's equal pay deal is just one battle in football's gender equality war,sport,"  The US Soccer equal pay deal is revolutionary, but more must be done to achieve true gender equality Over the past 30 years, the United States has been a trailblazer in women's football and the wider women's sport movement. They won the first official FIFA Women's World Cup against Norway back in 1991. They set a new world record for attendance at a women's sports event (90,185) when they hosted and won the tournament against China in 1999, and became the outright most dominant women's national team in football history when they won their third world title in 2015 and their fourth in 2019. The USA has continued to set benchmarks off the field, too. The introduction of Title IX by the federal government in 1972 ensured that women athletes at college level were provided with the same opportunities as their male counterparts, creating a youth development system that is still unrivalled across world sport. And in 2016, the US women's national team became the first of its kind to publicly sue their governing body over ""institutionalised gender discrimination"": a drawn-out legal process that was settled earlier this year and has since become representative of the structural challenges still faced by women in their fight for equality in sport, as well as by women in workplaces across the globe. This week, the USA added yet another victory to its already-heaving CV, becoming the latest nation to implement equal pay across its men's and women's senior national teams, joining countries like Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the Netherlands and Norway in creating contractual structures whereby players are paid the same. But unlike those nations, the USA has taken its newest collective bargaining agreement even further. Although the men's and women's teams negotiated separate agreements with US Soccer, the two sides will now be on an equal playing field in several areas: It's on this last point that the US Soccer deal is truly revolutionary. World Cup prize money has been one of the biggest sticking points for achieving genuine equal pay among national teams in football, primarily due to the massive disparities between the bonuses offered by FIFA and its member confederations to men's and women's teams who participate in their tournaments. At the 2018 men's World Cup, FIFA allocated a total prize pot of $US400 million to be distributed across all competing teams, with higher bonuses being given to teams the further they progressed. The winning national team, France, were awarded $US40 million for taking out the title. At the 2019 Women's World Cup, the total pot allocated by FIFA was just $U30 million, while the winners — the USA — collected $US4 million. Australia's progress in both of these tournaments demonstrates the disparities. While the Socceroos received around $8 million ($US5.6 million) just for qualifying for Russia (before failing to win a single game in the group stage), the Matildas received just $1 million ($US700,000) for reaching the quarter-final in France. These inequalities have appeared so insurmountable that they have shaped negotiations around closing the pay gap to the point where, until this week's deal, no other nation — including Australia — had specific mechanisms in place to equalise World Cup prize money. When asked why a shared prize money pool was not included in the Socceroos and Matildas' CBA that was negotiated in 2019, PFA co-chief executive Kate Gill said the prize money problem ought to be solved at its source rather than asking players themselves to negotiate with one another. ""FIFA continues to be the source of clear gender discrimination in relation to pay with the Women's World Cup prize money representing less than 14 per cent of what is awarded at the men's World Cup,"" Gill told ABC. ""In perpetuating this cycle, FIFA clearly fails to meet its human rights obligations and players are left to solve problems that are not of their making. ""Ahead of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFA was obliged to undertake a comprehensive Human Rights Risk Assessment. The report identified the lack of parity in prize money as a clear failure to respect the human rights of players and recommends that FIFA address this. ""If it is not addressed, Australia risks co-hosting a tournament that celebrates women but fails to treat the best players on the planet as equals."" Australia's approach to the prize money problem — which they launched as part of a campaign before the 2019 Women's World Cup — further differs from that of the USA in that it aims to assist other nations who may not have robust structures in place such as player unions or collective bargaining agreements, or whose cultures and national teams do not have the same global profile. It does this by making the overarching governing bodies of FIFA and its confederations responsible for investing in progress and equality instead of putting the burden on players themselves. However, given FIFA's glacial pace at redressing historical inequities in the women's game, it's understandable why federations like the USA are taking these measures of their own accord. Indeed, it's hoped that this week's revolutionary deal will act as a rising tide to lift the boats of other federations in the absence of genuine moves by FIFA and its confederations to pursue and embed gender equality within its structures. As US Soccer president and former US women's national team player Cindy Parlow-Cone said after the announcement: ""This is going to have ramifications throughout not only the footballing world, but the sports world. ""I'm really proud that we were the first country [to equalise prize money], but I would certainly hope we're not the last. ""I will work to continue to encourage CONCACAF [The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football] and FIFA to move in this direction as well. I think we do have willing partners there, but I don't think things are going to move as fast as we would all like for them to."" Indeed, the USA's equal pay deal is just one piece of the larger puzzle of true gender equality in the game — the vast majority of which exists below the pointy end of the football pyramid. For example, one of the reasons why the US men's national team was willing to give up a portion of their prize money in order to supplement the pay of their women colleagues was because they can afford to: the vast majority of income earned by male players in football comes from the club game, while women players derive a much higher percentage of their income from national team football. With club football taking on an increasingly important role in the lives of national team players, addressing pay inequality at this level is paramount. In Australia's A-Leagues, the minimum wage for a male player in the A-League Men's competition currently sits around $45,000 for a full-time 52-week season, which includes pre-season and a four-week finals series (and increases incrementally with age). However, while the league CBAs include a ""same base hourly rate"" principle for men and women players, the shorter length of the part-time A-League Women's season (23 weeks) means the minimum salary for women sits much lower at roughly $17,000. The A-League Women continues to lag behind other leagues overseas, but the APL's new private equity investment could change the game. In addition, male players also benefit from much more robust and supported youth development pathways, leading into full-time footballing careers in domestic leagues around the world from an earlier age. This is further complemented by domestic and global transfer systems that incentivise clubs and leagues to prioritise the development and opportunities for male players, selling them onto bigger clubs elsewhere for profit at the expense of working with emerging women players, whose own transfer market is only just emerging. Even beyond football, male players often sign much more lucrative sponsorship deals with brands and other organisations, in addition to having a far greater reach in terms of media coverage, marketing, and post-game opportunities in punditry and administration compared with women athletes. So while the USA's new equal pay deal is an unprecedented step for women's football and the women's sports movement more broadly, and will hopefully inspire other nations like Australia to continue updating their own agreements, it forms just one part of a much larger revolution that must take place if true equality in football is to be achieved.

63,The change in tactic that's helping bring fans back to live Super Netball games,sport," Sport Super Netball attendance bounces back from pandemic as clubs get creative While some of Australia's sporting codes have experienced a decline in crowd attendance this year, new studies show that netball has bounced back from the pandemic in a big way. According to research from Gemba, an Australian company providing insights, strategy and communications data on sport and entertainment, fans are attending professional matches at a higher rate this Super Netball season than the year before the pandemic began. Back in 2019, 17 per cent of Australian netball fans surveyed of the age 16 and over indicated that they'd attended at least one live netball match. And in 2020 and 2021, during the height of lockdowns and state border closures – which forced the Super Netball league to play a lot of its matches in hubs or without crowds – this attendance dropped to 15 and 16 per cent respectively. But in 2022, with a home and away season in full swing, that number has risen to 31 per cent over a four-month period from January through to April. This spike so early in the year is probably a product of Super Netball's earlier start to the season, in order to finish the competition before the Diamonds start their preparation for the Birmingham Commonwealth Games in July. The league's pre-season Team Girls Cup was also reintroduced to the netball calendar this year and was held on the last weekend of February, after the previous two tournaments were cancelled. Still, Gemba's head of marketing strategy Adam Hodge said Super Netball and its clubs must be putting in the hard yards to encourage people to turn up to the games. ""Our research data shows netball fans are flocking back to games post COVID restrictions,"" he said ""It would appear the sport has rallied hard and whatever they're doing is working."" One club that is trying new ways to entice fans back is the Melbourne Vixens. The side already has an extremely loyal fan base and one of the highest membership tallies in the competition, having been around since 2017 and won three premierships over the course of the trans-Tasman Championship and Super Netball era. However, during the last two years of the pandemic, they've only been able to host five games at John Cain Arena, and so the club has been desperate to reconnect with the community and rebuild an atmosphere at its home venue. By listening to fans – who've long complained that the sport places too much emphasis on marketing itself to children, instead of the adults that can afford to invest in the game – and capitalising on Super Netball's new broadcast deal, the Vixens have come up with a clever way to try to tap into the adult market. A move to Fox Sports for the 2022 season meant the league was able to reclaim its Saturday night prime-time TV slot, presenting an opportunity for the club to introduce Sippin' Saturdays, where fans can enjoy their netball with a glass of wine. ""We know that age group of 18-35 love their netball and are generally still playing or have recently retired and are big fans,"" Vixens general manager of netball development Angela Banbury said. ""Traditionally we've been focused on appealing to younger girls, but that Saturday night broadcast opened up an opportunity for us to engage with an older demographic. ""It's been popular, and we've got another coming up this weekend with the Vixens and NSW Swifts Round 11 game."" Banbury said the nights have been a hit with men and women, suggesting it was a great idea for a date. ""Both men and women have been attending,"" she said. ""They get a reserved seat and a drink on arrival, and there's a dedicated room that overlooks a view of Melbourne where they sit before the game starts."" Other initiatives that the club has incorporated into its game-day experience in recent years include the Ingles Family Sensory Room and Cubs Corner. Cubs Corner caters to new parents and young families, giving them the space to bring babies in prams and sit either in front or behind the glass of a converted corporate suite. The sensory room is a similar setup, allowing fans on the spectrum and their families to watch from a comfortable space with activities like colouring and toy blocks on hand, as well as headphones, yoga mats, beanbags, and soft toys. It was first introduced in 2019 – the same year Renae and Joe Ingles' son Jacob was diagnosed with autism. This year, the Vixens announced they'd officially named the sensory room in their honour. ""We'd seen a lot of sensory rooms popping up around the place, particularly overseas, and so that combined with our link to the Ingles made us think, why not introduce our own,"" Banbury said. ""The beauty of it, is that it's a safe space for the whole family, and stops them having to split up, in terms of one child going with Mum or Dad to the game and the other child staying home because it's too much for them to go to a sporting event. ""We're now three years down the track and during that time, there's been a lot more funds that have gone into the room to ensure the ambience is set up correctly."" Part of that involved working with KultureCity, an American non-profit organisation that specialise in the area and certify these spaces to make sure they meet the standard. KultureCity have also helped the AFL set up their sensory rooms at Docklands and Kardinia Park, while both Renae and Joe Ingles sit on the board. ""KultureCity are one of the leaders in helping educate people involved in stadia and sporting clubs on what people on the spectrum need to attend a game,"" Banbury said. ""A number of our staff had to do some online training and then we had to send them photos of the setup and all the activities we had on offer to get it approved."" The Vixens' space is the first the non-profit organisation has certified in netball around the world.

64,Josh Giddey laughs off apparent snub after being named in NBA All-Rookie second team,sport," Sport Josh Giddey laughs off latest NBA snub after being named in the All-Rookie second team Josh Giddey has laughed off his latest snubbing after the Australian teenager was relegated to the NBA All-Rookie second team despite a historic debut season for Oklahoma City. The guard won four Western Conference rookie-of-the-month awards but was pipped to the first team spot by Houston's Jalen Green, whose only monthly award came when Giddey was injured. NBA's decision — tweeted by The Athletic's high-profile basketball journalist Shams Charania — drew a pair of crying-laughing emoji faces from Giddey himself in a cheeky response. The announcement came after Giddey admitted he was disappointed to be overlooked for one of three nominations for the Rookie of the Year award last month. ""I missed a lot of games, which I understand. It is what it is, but I don't want to dig too much into it,"" Giddey said then. ""Looking back in five or 10 years, it's not going to bother me. So, it sucks. It is disappointing, but we move on."" In January, 19-year-old Giddey became the youngest player to register an NBA triple-double but a hip injury ended his season prematurely with a stat line of 12.5 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 7.6 assists per game. Alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Giddey gave the Thunder plenty to look forward to during a 24-58 season. Green (17.3 points, 3.4 rebounds, 2.6 assists), meanwhile, was part of the only team to finish below them in the West, the Rockets, that slumped to a 20-62 campaign. However, Green's efforts were still enough to win over the voting media and broadcasters, who were asked to select their five-man rookie first and second teams. Players received two points for each first team vote and one for each second team vote, with Giddey collecting 24 first-team votes and 74 second team votes for a combined total of 122 votes. Green (58 first-team votes and 42 second-team votes) won 158 votes, while Eastern Conference trio Scottie Barnes, Cade Cunningham and Evan Mobley (200 votes) were all unanimously awarded 100 first-team votes. Orlando's Franz Wagner was the other first-team selection, while Herbert Jones, Bones Hyland, Ayo Dosunmu and Chris Duarte joined Giddey in the reserves.

65,"'It just makes me feel sick': Concern over six greyhound deaths, 400 injuries recorded at Ipswich racing track",sport,"  Greyhound racing opponents raise concerns about deaths, injuries at Ipswich track and plans for new facility Last month four-year-old greyhound Catch Them Cutie competed in her last race – but she never made it across finish line. Warning: This story contains descriptions of animal injuries which some readers may find disturbing. Footage from the April 17 sprint at the Ipswich Greyhound Racing Club, west of Brisbane, shows the black-and-white dog tumble as she approached the first corner of the track. A steward's report stated: ""A post-race veterinary examination revealed the greyhound to have sustained a catastrophic injury to its near side foreleg and was humanely euthanised"". Her death marks the sixth at the track this racing season, which began last July, surpassing last season's entire death toll. Racing Queensland said there had been 411 injuries from 13,160 starters to May 9. Greyhound racing opponents fear there will be more deaths at the track, as more races from around south-east Queensland are moved to Ipswich after flooding closed Brisbane's Albion Park Raceway. Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds president Annie Hendley said the injuries ranged from broken necks and spines, to snapped legs. ""It just makes me feel sick. It's very upsetting,"" she said. ""Every time these dogs are put into a race, there's always a chance that they are going to be the one that has the catastrophic injury; that they will not finish that race alive."" Queensland Racing Integrity Commissioner Shane Gillard said the recent injuries and deaths were being investigated. ""We are working with Racing Queensland to determine if there are any contributing factors [outside an increase in race meetings] and if so, what actions should be taken,"" he said. A Racing Queensland spokesperson said injury rates have only increased ""from 2.88 per cent [last season] to 3.12 per cent"". ""The vast majority of all greyhounds [are] able to return to racing within a fortnight of injury,"" the spokesperson said. But Ms Hendley said the racing industry cared more about ""bets than pets"". ""Any other breed of dog wouldn't be treated like this,"" she said. ""Can you imagine any other breed of dog? Let's race these poodles. Oh, that poodle's going to be carried off and killed now, that poodle's fractured his leg. ""And yet why is it acceptable for greyhounds?"" The state government in 2019 announced $40 million would be spent on a new greyhound racing facility comprising three tracks at Purga in Ipswich. Construction of the track is expected to start this year but community consultation is still underway, the state government said. A petition against the new track has garnered more than 72,500 signatures. A study by the University of Technology Sydney engineers found straight tracks were safer for the animals, but the building proposal for the new Ipswich track, only has one of three tracks straight. ""Clearly using a straight track would eliminate all injuries that are directly associated with bends,"" the report for Greyhound Racing NSW chief veterinary officer Liz Arnott said. ""Bends are problematic for a number of reasons … It is strongly recommended that GRNSW and the Australian Greyhound Industry reconsider their aversion to straight tracks and consider developing purpose-built straight tracks."" Racing Queensland said it had brought in some of world's leading experts in track design. ""Among the amenities to be established include … modern cambers, a world-class racing surface, along with track radius and surface banking to be designed in a way to reduce excessive limb forces,"" the spokesperson said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Racing Minister Grace Grace acknowledged the community's animal welfare concerns and said the new facility was designed with animal safety in mind. ""Improving animal welfare is at the core of the design for the new Greater Brisbane Greyhound Centre (GBGC),"" she said. ""It's setting a new world-class safety standard in modern track design, while ensuring the viability and vitality of the industry. ""The GBGC project is still in the community consultation process."" Ms Hendley said the money would be better spent on rehabilitating injured animals and creating safer tracks. ""Dogs are still racing, being injured, dying — you're still building curved tracks,"" Ms Hendley said.

66,Wests Tigers confirm new recruit will play against Bulldogs just days after leaving Canterbury,sport," Sport Brent Naden set to play for Wests Tigers against Bulldogs just days after leaving Canterbury Brent Naden will go from training with the Bulldogs on Monday morning to playing against them on Friday night as a mid-season NRL recruit for the Wests Tigers. Tigers coach Michael Maguire confirmed on Thursday that Naden would play, while insisting he was not considering a switch in the opposite direction to join Canterbury in 2023. Instead, he said his focus remains solely on turning around the Tigers' tough start as they sit above only Canterbury on the ladder after 10 rounds. And he is hoping Naden can be part of that. The first man to exit Canterbury after Trent Barrett's resignation as coach, Naden can give the Tigers some backline strike-power after he was named in jersey number 21 on Tuesday. ""It was great for us,"" Maguire said. ""I met Brent some time ago and I have always kept an eye on his progress … it just became an opportunity when he became available. ""Where we are at the moment, we have been looking for someone with strike out wide. ""I went back and had a look at his highlight reel from when he was at Penrith and he is a very talented centre."" Bulldogs skipper Josh Jackson said the move had come as a shock, revealing Naden sent the squad a text message to announce his defection. Josh Jackson says the Bulldogs players supported Trent Barrett, revealing he was blindsided by Barrett's departure as head coach. ""Brent was a little bit out of the blue. Yesterday mid-afternoon, Brent sent us all a message,"" Jackson said. ""We weren't at training yesterday so he couldn't address the group. He was sorry for that but he told us all then. ""I spoke to him yesterday but I'm not too sure about the circumstances surrounding it, but I just rang him to make sure he was alright. ""He felt pretty comfortable with his decision and said he made the best decision for his family."" The Tigers have one more spot on their roster for 2022, but Maguire would not enter into speculation on whether fellow former Penrith and Bulldogs player Jack Hetherington would follow Naden across. Maguire is off contract at the end of this year, and is far from assured of an extension at the Tigers after fighting to keep his job at the end of last season. The Tigers have two wins from 10 games and desperately need a win on Friday night, with half Luke Brooks out for up to four weeks with a hamstring injury and Adam Doueihi also not due back until round 14. But Maguire laughed off questions over whether he was eying off the Bulldogs job for next year. ""My name has been tossed up for many things across the past six or 12 months,"" Maguire said. ""It's the world of rugby league. ""But we've got a big game tomorrow night … I'm real focused on the playing group that we have at the moment. ""I have really enjoyed the coaching with the attitude of the players. It helped launch careers both on and off the field and left an indelible mark on all who played in it. So what happened to the City v Country game, and what legacy has it left behind? Nick Campton reports. ""While we haven't managed to get the results we would have liked, the fight the players have shown for the jersey and everyone around the club [is commendable]. ""The foundation is there for us to propel ourselves for where we want to get to."" Pressed further on whether he had spoken to his management since Barrett's exit, Maguire said he had not discussed the Canterbury situation. ""No, I've got my eyes on my players right now,"" he said. ""It's a really important game for us. I have seen a real change in this playing group in the way they are going about things.""

67,Australian star scores penalty in drought-breaking Europa League victory for Eintracht Frankfurt,sport," Sport Australia's Ajdin Hrustic converts penalty to help lead Eintracht Frankfurt to victory in the Europa League final Eintracht Frankfurt’s 42-year wait for a European title has ended after a 5-4 penalty shootout win over Rangers in the Europa League final. Australian star Ajdin Hrustic successfully converted his penalty shot as Rafael Borré converted the decisive kick, giving the German club its first European trophy since the 1980 UEFA Cup, a predecessor to the Europa League. The win also secures a first appearance in the Champions League next season for Frankfurt. Kevin Trapp had already made a key save in the final minutes of extra time, before the veteran goalkeeper used his left leg to stop Aaron Ramsey's penalty in the shootout, setting off huge celebrations by Frankfurt's ""white wall"" of fans behind the opposite goal. There were also wild celebrations back in Germany as Frankfurt fans packed the club's stadium to watch the final. The match ended 1-1 after regulation and extra time. Joe Aribo gave Rangers the lead in the 57th minute and Borré equalized for Frankfurt in the 69th. Ramsey, the former Arsenal and Juventus midfielder, entered the match in the final minutes of extra time to be in the shootout. Christopher Lenz, Hrustic, Daichi Kamada and Filip Kostic converted the penalties for Frankfurt, while James Tavernier, Steven Davis, Scott Airfield and Kemar Roofe found the net for Rangers in the shootout. Rangers had been trying to win their first European title since lifting the trophy of the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1972. The Scottish club also lost to Zenit St Petersburg in the 2008 UEFA Cup. Frankfurt went undefeated throughout the entire Europa League campaign and will return to the continent's top club competition for the first time since 1960, when it lost in the European Cup final to Real Madrid in Glasgow. The game had been mostly even, with each club enjoying small spells of dominance until a mistake by Brazilian Frankfurt defender Tuta, who tripped while trying to chase down a routine back header, allowing Aribo to speed past him to open the scoring at Sevilla’s Ramón Sánchez-Pizjuán Stadium by calmly sending a low shot past Trapp. Frankfurt equalised 12 minutes later with Borré sliding in between two defenders to convert a cross by Kostic from the left flank. The Colombia forward came from behind central defender Calvin Bassey to send the ball past veteran goalkeeper Allan McGregor. There was fan violence outside the stadium before the match, with supporters from both clubs throwing chairs and tables at each other. Five German fans were detained the night before after a confrontation with police. More than 150,000 fans came to the southern Spanish city, most of them without tickets for the final at the 43,000-capacity stadium.

68,'Dare to dream': US Soccer Federation strikes equal pay deal between men's and women's teams,sport," Sport US Soccer Federation strikes equal pay deal between men's and women's teams The US Soccer Federation has reached milestone agreements to pay its men's and women's teams the same, bringing the American national governing body in line with other countries like Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, the Netherlands and Norway in promising equal pay for its senior teams. The federation on Wednesday announced separate collective bargaining agreements through December 2028 with the unions for both national teams, ending years of often acrimonious negotiations. The deals grew partly out of a push by players on the more successful women's team, including stars like Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, who were at the forefront of the gender equity fight while leading the team to a Women's World Cup title in 2019. The struggle became so much a part of the team's story that chants of ""Equal pay! Equal pay!"" rose from the crowd as US players celebrated winning the title in France. Former US First Lady Michelle Obama tweeted her congratulations to the players. ""I'm so proud of the talented players of @USWNT who worked tirelessly for years to advocate for the pay they deserve,"" she wrote. ""I'm thinking of all the little girls everywhere who dare to dream and will see this team as an example of what's possible when you never give up."" Morgan and Rapinoe could still be beneficiaries of the deal, though the next Women's World Cup is in 2023 and the make-up of the team will have changed by then. The biggest sticking point had been World Cup prize money, which is based on how far a team advances in the tournament. Megan Rapinoe is a giant of international football, but her impact on the game is felt just as much through her fight against injustice, writes Tracey Holmes. While the US women have been successful on the international stage with back-to-back World Cup titles, differences in FIFA prize money meant they took home far less than the men's winners. American women received a $US110,000 ($158,000) bonus for winning the 2019 World Cup. The US men would have received $US407,000 ($585,000) had they won the year earlier. In an unprecedented step in world football, the unions agreed to pool FIFA's payments for the men's World Cup later this year and next year's Women's World Cup, as well as for the 2026 and 2027 tournaments, which will then be split equally between the teams. Each player will also get matching game appearance fees in what the USSF said makes it the first federation to pool FIFA prize money in this manner.

69,"Tiger's here, but where's Phil? Everything you need to know ahead of the PGA Championship",sport," Sport PGA Championship: Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and everything you need to know about the second major of 2022 So much of professional golf's focus in recent weeks has been outside the ropes, and understandably so. But while civil war and controversy rage at the top of the game, fans and players alike will be relieved to turn their attentions back to the course. Southern Hills Country Club, to be specific, in Tulsa, Oklahoma for the second major of 2022 — the PGA Championship. So much has changed since the last running of this tournament, with the list of players competing — and not competing — cause for much discussion. Just hours from the first tee time, get yourself up to speed on how this tournament is shaping up. You better believe it. Tiger is teeing it up for the second time since the February 2021 car crash that shattered both of his legs and looked very likely to end his career. The first, of course, was at the Masters in April where Woods incredibly made the cut before fading over the weekend. While it was uncomfortable to watch a clearly hurting Tiger hobble around Augusta, it was magic to see him in action again. A month on, Tiger says he's feeling the fittest and strongest he has since the crash. Southern Hills is not an easy walk, but footage of his practice rounds showed Woods getting around with far more ease than he managed at the Masters. Tiger won the PGA Championship at this course in 2007 and while it remains a treat just to watch him playing, he wouldn't be competing unless he thought he could win. And with The Cat, you can never say never. Incredibly, he is not. Just 12 months on from his historic and still unfathomable PGA Championship triumph at Kiawah, Mickelson last week withdrew from the tournament. In fact, the reigning champion hasn't played any golf at all for months now, not since his comments about Saudi Arabia, the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the breakaway LIV Golf series. Mickelson has been taking time away from the game and despite some suggestion he might mark his return at this tournament, he will not be present to defend his title. At the moment, it's difficult to go past world number one and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler, who has been quite clearly the best golfer in the world in 2022. Fellow Texan Jordan Spieth only needs the PGA Championship to complete the career grand slam, and his form has been encouraging in recent weeks. On a course that will reward precise iron play, things may be falling into place for Spieth. Speaking of iron play, Collin Morikawa won this tournament in 2020 and if he has a good putting week, he will certainly be among the leaders. The same can be said of Jon Rahm, who has been having a nasty year with the putter but remains one of the world's best ball-strikers. Also worth consideration are other big names like Patrick Cantlay, Brooks Koepka and Justin Thomas, but also guys like Sam Burns, Daniel Berger and Max Homa. Oh, and there's this Australian bloke… Cameron Smith has been laying relatively low since his disappointing finish at the Masters, but he remains one of the hottest players in the world. If Smith can have a decent week with driver in hand, his outstanding iron play, short game and putting will put him in contention. It's what won him the Players in March and had him in the final group at Augusta in April. Smith is definitely Australia's best hope, but not our only one. Marc Leishman isn't enjoying his best year but has a habit of lifting for majors, while Jason Day has shown the odd glimpse of his old self in 2022. Min Woo Lee impressed in his first Masters this year and may well be inspired by his sister Minjee, who is close to the best female golfer on the planet right now. Then there's Adam Scott, who has been relatively consistent this season. Cam Davis, Lucas Herbert and Matt Jones round out the Aussie contingent.

70,"Brumbies, Waratahs face challenge of restoring self-belief as finals approach",sport," Sport Brumbies, NSW Waratahs face challenge of restoring self-belief ahead of Super Rugby Pacific finals In past seasons, all five Australian teams getting beaten by New Zealand opposition in a single weekend would have been cause for panic and ignited commentary pointing to the results as proof the game of rugby was dying in Australia. The five Australian sides did all lose to New Zealand teams last weekend, but there has been no panic so far and the ""doom and gloom"" commentary also hasn't surfaced. And why is that, you would be excused for wondering? For starters, reports of the game's death in Australia have always been exaggerated. Also, after a much-improved showing from Australian teams against New Zealand opposition in 2022 — and with already three times as many wins across the first four cross-over rounds this season as were recorded across the five weeks of Super Rugby trans-Tasman in 2021 — last weekend was quickly seen to be an anomaly. Of course, the results and the performances can all be better, and none of these opening paragraphs are trying to suggest that everything is awesome. Indeed, the Queensland Reds, Melbourne Rebels and Western Force remain desperate to convert a couple of close losses into their first cross-over wins. The Rebels and Force are facing mathematical tasks to break into the top eight, but the Reds are right in the thick of it and should still be eyeing off the fourth-place finish that still dangles in front of them, albeit with a few conditions applied. The return of back rowers Harry Wilson and Fraser McReight this week will certainly make a difference for the Reds as they host Moana Pasifika in Brisbane on Friday night, while the inclusion of James O'Connor — with a week under his belt after returning from injury — can only help as well. The Waratahs and Brumbies, though, have a slightly bigger challenge this weekend. The Waratahs face the Highlanders in Dunedin and the Brumbies host the Blues in a top-of-the-table clash at Canberra Stadium. Both Australian sides went down in close contests last weekend after a string of wins. The Brumbies may concede they made too many mistakes and gifted the Crusaders far too big a first-half lead in their 37-26 loss to the New Zealanders in Canberra last Friday night. The Waratahs will still be smarting from a second-half capitulation in which the Hurricanes did not take the lead for the first time in the match until the 75th minute. Both sides know they can beat New Zealand teams, as they have shown through their results this season. They need to recapture the belief and mindset that had served them quite well until round 13. And they need to do that because there are now only two games left before the finals series begins. ""We still want to go into the quarter-finals with momentum,"" Waratahs assistant coach Chris Whitaker said in Sydney on Tuesday. The Highlanders have vaulted into the top eight — at the expense of the Force and Rebels — on the back of three straight wins after a torrid run through the first 10 rounds. ""They [Highlanders] played good footy at the start of the year but lost a couple of games on the bell,"" Whitaker said. ""They're definitely dangerous … obviously with [All Blacks scrum-half] Aaron Smith steering them around the park. ""An Australian team hasn't won [in Dunedin] since 2014 so we know it's going to be a big battle."" The Waratahs have a few more players available for the clash with the Highlanders. Wallabies captain Michael Hooper is ready to go again after sitting out last weekend's loss to the Hurricanes at Leichhardt Oval, and Ned Hanigan is set to pull on a Waratahs jersey for the first time in nearly two years after returning from Japan. Similarly, the Brumbies will welcome fly half Noah Lolesio back to steer the team around again, with the Canberra-based side facing the first-placed Blues in a match that could have a major impact on the top two. ""Noah's been our first-choice 10 for a couple of years now, and it certainly gives the team a lift just having him fit and available,"" Brumbies coach Dan McKellar said on Wednesday The Brumbies played an uncharacteristic brand of rugby to trail the Crusaders 23-5 at half-time last Friday night, before clicking into gear and running in three tries to two in the second half to prove to themselves their game plan still worked. ""There was a lot to take out of it, in terms of belief and confidence,"" McKellar said of his side's strong second half once they had overcome their error-strewn first half against the Crusaders. Belief and confidence quickly emerge as key themes going into their huge clash with the Blues this weekend and they will remain so going forward into the finals. At this time of the season, most tweaks are mental. ""You look at the Rebels and their previous fortnight [before their three-point loss to the Chiefs last weekend], and it just sums up that so much of it is between the ears and mindset,"" McKellar said. ""We're certainly no different. We've got to be in the right place mentally to deliver what you need to deliver physically and obviously in these games you've got to be brutal and physical. ""Having that intent and that mindset is a massive part of that.""

71,'Giro from hell' continues for Caleb Ewan after fifth-place finish on stage 11,sport," Sport Caleb Ewan misses out in another bunch sprint on stage 11 of Giro d'Italia Caleb Ewan's wait for a first victory at this year's Giro d'Italia continues after he was out-sprinted by unheralded Italian Alberto Dainese on stage 11. Ewan ran out of legs on the straight run in to Reggio Emilia at the end of the 203-kilometre stage, finishing in fifth place. The Australian appeared to be in ideal position in the final hundred metres, only to run out of gas as the line approached. Fernando Gaviria finished in second place and Simone Consonni finished third. Two-time stage winner at this year's race and overall points leader Arnaud Demare finished fourth, with Mark Cavendish sixth. The final sprint came after a stunning solo effort from Dries de Bondt of Alpecin-Fenix, who came within 1,200 metres of a stage win after holding off the chasing pack for over 50 kilometres. The Australian has endured a tough Giro d'Italia so far, crashing on stage one and missing out on victory in stage six by half the width of a wheel. In Tuesday's race, Ewan was one of the first riders to be dropped, finishing all on his own, dead last, over half an hour behind stage winner Biniam Girmay. In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Ewan wrote that since his first-stage crash, he felt his Giro ""just keeps going down hill"" but that he was ""hoping to turn it around"" in Wednesday's stage. He was in good company at the pointy end of Wednesday's route though, with the sprint teams of Lotto-Soudal, Groupema-FDJ and Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl making their presence felt during a rapid day's racing. The pancake-flat, 203km stage from Santarcangelo di Romagna to Reggio Emilia carried the potential to be a slow day. However, an easy day was never on the cards as the stage burst into life around the half way mark when the peloton, spooked by the prospect of cross winds, ramped up the pace through Bologna. Ewan suffered a brief scare when he was caught out by the change in pace, although the 27-year-old was able to regain contact as the group slowed. The respite in the pack was fleeting though, as Cavendish's Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl team and Ineos Grenadiers injected another surge to effect a split before the second intermediate sprint. The pack all came back together though, until de Bondt was allowed to drift off the front in his brave solo effort. with 55km remaining, the Belgian dangling off the front before he was eventually hauled in with just over a kilometre to go. Richard Carapaz picked up a three-second bonus at the second intermediate sprint to move to second place in the overall standings. Juan Pedro López Pérez retains the overall lead in the race of the Maglia Rosa, 12 seconds ahead of João Almeida and Carapaz. Australian Jai Hindley, who was well protected by his Bora-Hansgrohe team remains in fifth place.

72,'I leave with a heavy heart': Aussie Matthew Mott appointed England cricket coach,sport," Sport Australia women's cricket mentor Matthew Mott becomes England men's ODI and T20 coach Australia's all-conquering women's cricket team is searching for a new coach with Matthew Mott accepting an offer to lead England men's white-ball side. Mott will join Brendon McCullum in trying to turn around the flagging fortunes of England after the former New Zealand star was last week appointed Test coach. His current assistant and former star all-rounder Shelley Nitschke will coach Australia for a tri-series in Northern Ireland and the Commonwealth Games campaign in Birmingham. Mott has coached Australia since 2015, with the team close to unstoppable since being unexpectedly knocked out in the 2017 ODI World Cup semi-finals. Australia has had an unprecedented period ranked number one across the T20 and 50-over formats and also set a new world record by winning 26-straight ODIs. Australia's latest Cricket World Cup is a triumph all on its own, but it also exorcises demons that have followed this side for five years. ""I feel honoured to have been a part of such an amazing group of people over the last seven years,"" the 48-year-old said. ""I leave with a heavy heart but with so many wonderful memories. ""The on-field success is well-documented but it's the lifelong friendships that I've formed that resonate most with me. ""I am very proud to have been part of a sport that has been able to endure the last couple of years and come through it with an even brighter future. ""This playing group is led magnificently by a number of players, including [captain] Meg [Lanning] and Rach [Haynes], who have together helped forge a culture which will thrive for many years to come. ""I wish the team all the best and look forward to seeing them grow what's become an incredible legacy."" While in negotiations with England about the vacant position, Mott was hit with the tragic death of ""great mate"" Andrew Symonds. ""The support of his beautiful family and close friends in the coming days is going to be vitally important so I respectfully request for some time to process his passing and the immense loss before making any further comment,"" Mott said. Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley paid tribute to Mott's leadership of the women's team. ""Under Matthew's leadership, the team has claimed every major trophy on offer and importantly, has inspired kids across the country to pick up a bat and ball,"" Hockley said. ""He should be proud of the legacy he's helped create with our women's team.

73,Jack's back: Shayna Jack makes Australian team for Commonwealth Games,sport," Sport Shayna Jack makes Australian Commonwealth Games swim team, pop-star Cody Simpson also qualifies Queensland swimmer Shayna Jack has capped her comeback from a drug ban by coming second in the women's 100 metres freestyle event at the Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide. Her second spot in a personal best time guarantees her selection for the Australian team for the World Championships in Budapest in June and Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in July. The race was won by Mollie O'Callaghan, who set the fastest time in the world this year of 52.49 seconds. It is the first time Jack has made an Australian team since she ended her two-year ban for taking a minute amount of the banned drug Ligandrol in 2019. Jack protested her innocence but, after a series of court challenges, she was forced to sit out the sport and miss last year's Olympic Games. Jack last competed for Australia at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, where she won a relay gold medal. ""I'm overwhelmed with emotion to be back on the team,"" Jack said as she fought back tears. ""Not very many people know what I actually really went through – you know the depths of it and to be back and wearing those colours again means more than anything to me. ""My goal was to love swimming and fall in love with it again and I have and I'm really, really proud to be back. ""There's a lot of times I thought I might not get to this point – not just obviously because of the whole case and everything like that – but I struggled, I kind of lost touch with why I love swimming and why I did swim. ""It's still a journey, I'm still learning and doing things and working with psychologists with all those things and that's been really, really beneficial with my comeback."" Jack's time of 52.60 was the second-fastest time in the world this year behind O'Callaghan. ""To be completely honest I am stronger, and I am fitter and faster than ever, which I just proved, and this is just the beginning for me,"" she said. Australian swimmer Shayna Jack features in a German documentary that shows athletes can return positive tests after just shaking hands with someone who has used a banned substance. The performance of O'Callaghan and Jack points to the ongoing strength of Australian women's sprinting. Emma McKeon, who won four gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics, is sitting out these swimming championships as is Cate Campbell, who has won 7 national championships, and her sister Bronte. But O'Callaghan and Jack as well as Meg Harris who came third and Madison Wilson who came fourth in world-class times, showed that Australia will field a formidable relay team at the World Championships and Commonwealth Games. ""We're a weapon to be scared of and I can't wait to see what we can do best at the Worlds,"" Jack said. That team will be strengthened even further when McKeon returns for the Commonwealth Games. O'Callaghan said she was surprised with her stunning swim — a personal best after setting another personal best during the morning's heats. ""I think it was just more nerves and stuff and I kind of sometimes a little bit doubt myself, but yeah I'm really surprised it was such a big jump,"" the 18-year old said. Pop singer and actor Cody Simpson gave himself a chance of selection for the Australian team at the World Championships by coming third in the Men's 100m Butterfly. The event was won by Tokyo dual bronze medallist Matthew Temple in 51.50 seconds. Olympic 100m freestyle gold and silver medallist Kyle Chalmers was second. Chalmers is returning to swimming after a shoulder operation but has said he won't compete at the World Championships, which opens the door for Simpson's selection. ""To get on a podium at a national meet is pretty unreal,"" Simpson said after recording 51.96, equalling the FINA qualifying mark. Simpson returned to his junior sport in 2020 after establishing a stellar career as a singer and actor. ""I've just put in the hours all year, just trying to make some progress and I didn't expect this much progress so soon,"" he said. He said making the Australian team would mean everything to him because his mother, Angie, also swam for Australia. ""I was told as a little boy that I'd want to swim for Australia as well and then obviously I was side-tracked for the better part of ten years,"" he said. That ""side-track"" saw him become an international pop star in his teens, gain modelling contracts and perform in a Broadway musical He said his ""other career"" as a pop singer was ""on the back-burner for now"". ""I mean I released an album a few months ago, it's still something that I like to do,"" Simpson said. ""Ian Thorpe was always telling me, 'if you stop playing music, I'll stop mentoring you'."" Simpson said he talked about returning to swimming with other superstars of the sport including Grant Hackett and Michael Phelps. ""No one said it was crazy when I told them … I told Phelps, I told Hackett, I told Thorpe and I was never greeted with any doubt from any of those guys, like they were always going, 'yeah, I think you can do it',"" he said. ""That obviously just gave me the air under my wings to want to give it a crack."" Earlier, Tokyo Olympian Elijah Winnington began his return to swimming redemption by defending his Men's 400m freestyle national title in 3:43.10. Winnington went into the Olympics as a gold medal favourite but performed disappointingly, finishing seventh. He said he fell into a state of semi-depression after the Games. ""The last real 400 I did was the one in Tokyo which I kind of walked away from very disappointed as you can imagine,"" he said. ""It's a race I've been very nervous for coming back, this is my big race really since Tokyo. ""I knew where I was physically, but I wasn't really sure where my mind was going to go."" He said he's spent a long time working on his psyche since Tokyo. ""I've had months and months of psychological sessions, just reflective sessions and even like really positively trying to reflect on Tokyo and see all the advantages I got from that outcome although it might not have been the result that I wanted,"" he said. Rio gold medallist Mack Horton came second behind Winnington, guaranteeing him a spot in the World Championships and Commonwealth Games. Horton missed out on an individual swim at Tokyo although he was selected as a relay swimmer. ""I can say that I'm still growing and still learning,"" Winnington said.

74,Newcastle pulls off shock NRLW recruitment double ,sport," Sport Newcastle signs star Brisbane duo Millie Boyle and Tamkia Upton in huge NRLW recruitment coup Newcastle has pulled off a massive recruitment coup by signing star Broncos duo Tamika Upton and Millie Boyle for the 2022 NRLW season. The two had previously spent their entire NRLW careers with Brisbane, where they both played key roles in establishing the Broncos' domination of the competition's early years. But they will now ply their trade in the Hunter, giving the Knights — who were winless wooden spooners in the rescheduled 2021 season earlier this year — the boost they need to challenge the competition's big guns. Boyle is universally regarded as the top forward in the NRLW with her incredible work rate and athleticism in the middle of the field earning her joint Dally M player of the year honours alongside Dragons fullback Emma Tonegato in April. ""I couldn't be more excited to arrive in Newcastle and experience what it's like to run out in a Knights jersey,"" Boyle said. ""Everyone knows how passionate this town is about footy and all of the NRLW girls experienced that in round one of the season just finished."" ""The team the Knights are building will be very competitive … there's a good mix of experienced players and really exciting young talent coming through. The season can't come soon enough."" Upton, a regular for Queensland's Origin side in recent years, is known for her scorching sidestep and blistering pace. With seven tries in 11 matches for the Broncos, she's the second-highest try scorer in the competition's history. ""First and foremost, I'm coming to Newcastle to get better,"" said Upton. ""Everyone I have met here on both the women's and men's sides are invested in ensuring this team becomes a success and I'm looking forward to playing a small part in that."" The Knights failed to win a game in their debut NRLW season but will become instant finals contenders now Boyle and Upton are in the Hunter. Their move also casts doubt over Brisbane's ability to bounce back from their shock preliminary final defeat to the eventual grand final-winning Roosters, which resulted in the premiership trophy leaving Queensland for the first time. The 2022 NRLW season is expected to kick off in August with pre-season to commence in the coming months.

75,"'Most well-rounded coach': Bulldogs captain goes into bat for Trent Barrett, blames players for poor start",sport," Sport Bulldogs NRL captain Josh Jackson goes into bat for former coach Trent Barrett Bulldogs captain Josh Jackson has described outgoing coach Trent Barrett as the ""most well-rounded"" coach he has ever had, as he placed blame on the playing group for the NRL team's poor start to the season. Barrett stepped down as Canterbury coach on Sunday, before the club had been set to hold a board meeting to discuss his future at Belmore. ""To my knowledge, the board were going to sit down on Monday and have a chat about the future and the results — I asked if I could speak to them and let them know [Barrett] has the support of all the players,"" Jackson said. ""I don't feel let down by Trent. I understand his position, but I'd like Trent to be here, obviously. ""He's the most well-rounded coach I've ever had — a great communicator, motivator, great footy intelligence — he's been fantastic for me."" Trent Barrett stands down as Bulldogs coach ""effective immediately"" after a disastrous start to the season. Jackson said he felt blindsided by Barrett's departure and appeared distressed as he spoke to media about the coach taking the blame for the team's performance. ""It's the players [who] are responsible. We are the ones on the field and we are the ones who aren't delivering the results,"" Jackson said. ""Unfortunately, Trent has fallen on his sword for us."" The Bulldogs have started the season with a 2-8 win-loss record, while the team managed just five victories from 34 games under Barrett's tutelage. With the clash with Wests Tigers just two days away, former Bulldogs player Mick Potter has come in to fill Barrett's shoes as interim head coach. ""I think he's a fantastic addition, a premiership winner, has won two premierships here and he has a lot of experience as a head coach,"" Jackson said. ""And he brings an outsiders' perspective, which I think is good."" One of the few veteran, one-club players in the NRL, Jackson has been part of the Bulldogs fabric since 2012, and has seen both Dean Pay and Des Hasler depart as head coach before Barrett called it quits. Jackson said there was an element of groundhog day in Barrett's departure, but denied there was a cultural problem at the club. ""If there was a cultural issue here, we'd be getting beat by 60 every week,"" he said. ""A lot of the games we've been in, we've only lost by a small margin. ""I guess the last couple of weeks have been disappointing, playing teams that have been in a similar position to us."" Languishing at the bottom of the ladder with the same win-loss record as this weekend's opponents, Jackson refused to be written off with 15 rounds to go. ""We've got two choices: We can use this as an excuse for poor performances and poor preparation or we can rally together and go out there and win. [The latter is] what we plan to do,"" Jackson said. ""We don't have to change too much. It's Round 11. We have plenty more footy to play this year. As it stands, we are sitting three wins outside of the top eight so we haven't given up on the season."" As for Barrett's future, Jackson said he hoped another club would take him on. ""He's a fantastic coach and I hope he doesn't give it up,"" he said. ""I hope he pushes on because he has a lot of value to add.""

76,Inside the game: How Carlton under Michael Voss is closing the gaps in Blues' gameplan ,sport," Sport Smashing clearances and defending the counter — how Carlton coach Michael Voss is closing gaps for the Blues The year is 1995, and the footy world is painted in a shade of blue. That year's grand final was one of the most anticipated in years, matching the top two teams on the ladder against each other on the last day of September. Carlton, minor premiers with arguably the league's most-punishing defence, faced off against second-placed Geelong with the league's most dangerous attack. Both sides won their preliminary finals by more than 10 goals, sweeping through their toughest rivals with ease. Their one encounter through the season was a thriller, with Carlton winning a nail biter by just three points. But the grand final was not an epic for the ages, instead Carlton blew Geelong off the park by half-time. Gary Ablett was kept goalless for the first time in three years, and Carlton set a record for most wins in a year, with 23. By the end of the game, Carlton had sealed their record 16th premiership, and were on top of the footy world. Carlton could, literally, do no wrong. Then, Peter Dean fell from the podium. As time has passed, Dean's tumble has seemed less like a celebration gone awry and more like a metaphor for the coming two and a half decades. A couple of near misses in the years following were perhaps signs of false hope, with their loss to the Roos in the 1999 grand final being their last real stand. Salary cap breaches, forfeited draft picks and five wooden spoons followed in the new millennium, with the once-proud club falling on hard times. Years in the wilderness followed, punctuated by a period of Brett Ratten-led competency. Now, the Blues sit inside the top four and the Dean-inspired stumble may appear to be coming to an end. With new coach Michael Voss at the helm, long-suffering Blues fans are hoping that their time is now, and that this isn't another false dawn. Even in the darkest of times, there are moments of light along the way. This was no different for Carlton. New hopes — whether star recruits (Chris Judd), number-one draft picks (Matthew Kruezer, Bryce Gibbs, Andrew Walker and Marc Murphy) and legendary coaches (Mick Malthouse) — have littered the Blues during this drought. The Blues' last coach, David Teague, started with an impressive early burst of form before reality began to set in again. Under Teague, the best moments of footy were captivating, aesthetically pleasing, counter-attacking footy that revolved around a prototypical key position forward. When it came off, it looked spectacular. However, there were trade-offs. For all the excitement created when Carlton got out on the break, their defence was prone to letting equally exciting attacks in the other way. With waves of players rushing ahead of the ball, and quicker ball movement prioritised, limited pressure was placed on the ball and deeper defenders were often left isolated or alone. No side allowed more contested one-on-ones than the Blues last year, and their ability to slow sides after turning it over was limited. Fixing those structural defensive issues was a critical issue for Voss, but perhaps not the only one. Overall, the signs seem positive for Carlton so far this year. Carlton are setting up more cautiously at contests and not racing ahead prematurely. Most prominently, the Blues seem to be defending the counter-attack more effectively. This has included deploying the spare defenders able to assist in closing down those high-value, one-on-one opportunities. It has taken away a little bit of the sting of their attack from turnovers but, in turn, they can stop opponents from putting up cricket scores. It's not just the defence that has improved so far this year. Voss — as one of the most-damaging clearance players of his era — has an innate eye on not only how to win the hard ball but also how to make it useful. At Port Adelaide, he helped to develop the Power group into one of the strongest in the competition, one that focused on both sides of the ball. This strength has transferred over to the Blues' early season form. So far this year, Carlton has had one of the most-damaging clearance set-ups of any team in the competition. Part of the equation is a more even focus on who is targeted in the middle, but part of it is personnel. The recruitment of Adam Cerra and George Hewett in the off-season has given the Blues two more quality, ball-winning options, allowing Sam Walsh to work more on the outside. This has forced opposition teams to focus less on shutting down Patrick Cripps, giving their talisman more space to do what he does best. Cripps has responded with a career year, and has finally added a serious forward string to his bow. He has registered career highs in goals and marks inside 50, a remarkable feat considering he has only played seven and a bit games this year. It's also emblematic of the Blues' reworked forward structure. Last year, Carlton was heliocentric around Coleman medallist Harry McKay, who was targeted as much as any player in the competition. That led to a somewhat predictable attack, and one that was concentrated on relatively few contributors. Thanks to the return of Charlie Curnow from injury, and some tactical repositioning, the Blues have more ways to hitting the scoreboard this year. McKay has worked further up ground, and Jack Silvagni seems revitalised in a ruck-forward role. Last year, McKay was targeted 248 times inside 50, the third-most of any player in the competition. The next-highest Carlton players were Eddie Betts and Levi Casboult, with 72 targets each. While McKay is still in the top five for targets this year, with 85, Curnow has already been targeted 73 times this year. When one of these three taller forwards is playing further up the ground, or taking a spell on the bench, Cripps tends to float forward more. This creates mismatches across the opposition's defensive set-up, one that Carlton is primed to capitalise on. In short, the Blues are playing a well-rounded style of footy, one that is markedly improved on years past. It's a style that, combined with the sheer amount of talent on the list, has the Blues primed to play finals footy. In his first senior coaching stint at Brisbane, Voss was able to coax an ageing Lions outfit into finals in his first year before facing four years well outside of finals. Some debate still exists in northern footy circles about the cause for the Lions decline, one which was only halted by the recent, Chris Fagan-led rebuild. Voss has been given the rarest of things in footy: a true second chance. Carlton has stocked up on proven senior talent via trades and free agency in recent years, combined with a fair sprinkling of high draft picks. Few can contest that the raw talent is there. The second half of the year is always more challenging for sides that have transformed over the off-season. The opposition analysis gets sharper, and the rest of the league starts to work out the nuts and bolts of what is going on. Carlton's early season form has also been boosted by a relatively soft schedule to date, beating just one side currently in the top 8 (Richmond in eighth place). The run home shapes as being significantly tougher than the start of the year. Few can deny, however, that the Blues are playing good footy. So good, in fact, that die hard Bluebaggers across the country will be hoping that their side will win their first final since 2013.

77,Former Wests Tigers coach Mick Potter to lead Canterbury for rest of 2022 season,sport," Sport Canterbury appoint Mick Potter as interim coach for rest of NRL season Mick Potter will take the reins from Trent Barrett at the battling Canterbury Bulldogs for the rest of the NRL season. A two-time premiership-winning player with the Bulldogs, Potter coached Wests Tigers in 2013 and 2014 but failed to reach the finals in either campaign. Currently coaching Canterbury's feeder club Mounties in the NSW Cup, Potter will fill the void at the bottom-of-the-table side after Barrett stepped down on Monday. A 16-6 loss to Newcastle on Friday night at Suncorp Stadium in the Magic Round opener proved the final straw for Bulldogs officials, who spent the weekend discussing Barrett's future. Barrett took the decision out of the board's hands, stepping down from the role effective immediately on Monday morning. The Bulldogs (2-8) are averaging fewer than 10 points per game in the first 10 rounds, an unwanted offensive feat not matched since the South Queensland Crushers battled in 1996. Barrett leaves Belmore having won just five of 34 matches in charge, despite an expensive recruitment drive that has included the additions of Josh Addo-Carr, Matt Burton, Tevita Pangai, Matt Dufty and Paul Vaughan. The coach's departure has already triggered player movement, with Brent Naden joining the Tigers and others reportedly considering an exit. Bulldogs football boss Phil Gould said Potter's experience would be crucial before they looked for a permanent replacement. ""It is great to have a genuine legend returning to the club,"" Gould said. ""Michael has extensive experience in the game and will bring a new voice and new ideas to our players."" Potter said he was honoured and excited about the opportunity to help. ""I wish it were under different circumstances as I've known Trent for a long time and I really feel for him,"" he said.

78,ParaMatildas make history with silver medal at inaugural Cerebral Palsy Women's World Cup,sport,"  ParaMatildas show 'never say die' spirit as they win silver in inaugural Cerebral Palsy Women's World Cup final Seventy-three days ago, the ParaMatildas — Australia's first national team for women and girls with cerebral palsy, acquired brain injury, and symptoms of stroke — didn't exist. Thirteen days ago, they hadn't played a single game together as a team. Yesterday, in the heat of Salou in Spain, they became the first senior Australian football team to win a silver medal at a World Cup, pushing the mighty USA to extra time in a thrilling final before falling to the eventual champions 4-2. The two teams qualified for the gold medal play-off as the two best-performing sides in the round-robin tournament, with the USA finishing in top spot after their final-day 4-0 victory over Australia in the group stage. However, the ParaMatildas learned many lessons from that loss ahead of their title-defining clash. As co-captain Georgia Beikoff said beforehand: ""We saw that match against the USA as a dress rehearsal. We had a few injuries, including myself, and that took me out for the second half. There were also a few other things that were going on like Katelyn [Smith] having asthma, which knocked her over. ""We're confident that we can play a better game today and are really keen to just kill it."" And so they did. Despite the fatigue of their fifth match in seven days, the ParaMatildas came out far more confident and organised in Tuesday's final. Defying their underdog status, Australia pressed the USA's physical midfielders and peppered the goal throughout the first half, with pacey striker Lainee Harrison looking the most dangerous. Their momentum eventually paid off in the 23rd minute when co-captain Eloise Northam scored a sensational full-field lob to hand the ParaMatildas a 1-0 lead at half-time. But the USA, a long-standing powerhouse in the women's game, bounced back almost immediately in the second half, scoring two quick-fire goals through substitutes Annie Wickett and Jessiyn Kuhmnel. True to the Matildas' ""never say die"" spirit, though, the ParaMatildas refused to give in, defending valiantly as the USA's refreshed side gained the upper-hand. And just as it looked like the title race was over, Australian goalkeeper Katelyn Smith scored a miraculous equaliser four minutes from full-time, firing the ball up-field with such venom that the opposition goalkeeper was bundled back across her own line to make it 2-2 and send the crowd into raptures. Pushed into extra-time and buffeted by the sizzling Salou sun, the ParaMatildas began to fade as the bench depth and fitness of their opponents came through. Two more goals to Kuhmnel and Emma Martin saw the USA crowned inaugural CP Women's World Cup champions with a 4-2 win. Japan secured the bronze medal earlier in the day by defeating the Netherlands 4-1. Despite the loss, Australia have still written themselves into the history-books, becoming the country's first senior football team to qualify for a final and win a silver medal at a World Cup. Further, two ParaMatildas players won individual gongs for their performances throughout the tournament. Katelyn Smith won the Golden Glove for most outstanding goalkeeper, while Beikoff claimed the Golden Boot with 13 goals across the five games. ""It's been quite surreal,"" the 29-year-old Beikoff, who's also a Paralympic bronze medallist in javelin, said before the final. ""I was not expecting to get all those goals, especially in the first match against the Dutch. ""Just being here and playing against other women who have CP, who [are] exactly like me, is a dream come true. ""It's been a really full-on eight weeks since we put the team together. Some of these girls haven't really played football before, so I'm really proud of how they've stepped up. ""It's been a really big learning curve for us and this is just the beginning. I'm really excited for the future.""

79,"These women grew up in rugby league heartland but had 'nothing to aspire to'. Now, they're making history ",sport,"  NRLW expansion an 'unreal' opportunity for female rugby league players in North Queensland Jasmine Peters was 12 when she was unexpectedly thrust into the world of rugby league. ""My mum doesn't like this story,"" she laughed. Peters' soccer training was cancelled on the same day as her school's rugby grand final and she convinced her dad to take her along. ""We went over to the Mackay Junior Rugby League field and I played my first ever rugby league game,"" she said. ""I happened to get Man of the Match — or Woman of the Match — as well."" Now 19, Peters is a rising star in the NRLW. She made her debut this year for the Gold Coast Titans and plays for the North Queensland Gold Stars — the region's team in the state league. The young side is made up of players from Townsville, Cairns and Mackay who train in satellite squads brimming with local talent. Eight Gold Stars were contracted to the NRLW this year as the popularity of the sport continued to climb. ""Girls are coming through with a lot more knowledge about rugby league and, playing at a semi-professional level at a lot younger age,"" coach Gavin Lloyd said. Soon, more women from North Queensland — considered the heartland of rugby league — could have the opportunity to play at the highest level. The NRLW is on the cusp of a major expansion, with the Cowboys among several teams to lodge an application to enter the competition from 2023. ""I think it's amazing,"" Peters said. ""Just the fact that we're getting enough screen time, we're getting enough of an audience watching us play, it's becoming a bigger game and creating those opportunities for other girls to be part of the sport at that higher elite level."" Donning a Cowboys jersey would be a dream come true for Gold Stars players like Lauren Moss, who had her sights set on an NRLW debut. ""It's the best news I think I've heard all year,"" Moss said. The 30-year-old mine worker, who was recruited to year's Titans squad but never played first grade, only picked up rugby league about six years ago. ""I was only doing it for fun and for the enjoyment of it, but seeing the pathways and seeing where we can go with it, it just makes it all the more exciting,"" she said. ""It drives you even more to want to do more and be better, because you can know where you can go — you can end up in the NRL."" As part of the NRLW expansion, teams will move to a $350,000 salary cap which is set to increase players' pay by an average of 28 per cent. Lloyd said it was a promising sign for players who balanced a delicate tightrope of work, sport and study with little compensation. ""I think the way it's going, in two or three years they'll possibly make a living out of playing rugby league,"" he said. For Gold Stars captain Romy Teitzel, the prospect of a Cowboys women's team would be extra special. ""Growing up in North Queensland, everyone looked up to the Cowboys, no matter if you're a boy or a girl,"" she said. ""Dad played for the club in the inaugural team for the men, so to run out for the women, it'd be unreal."" Teitzel, who led the Newcastle Knights for their debut season this year, said she was eager to see every NRL club one day field a women's team. ""Like many of the girls around my age, we didn't have anything to aspire to growing up,"" she said. ""The game has grown so much in the last 12 months, and on a professional basis, I think it's just going to keep skyrocketing.""

80,How the Penrith community is using rugby league to fight the stereotypes,sport," Sport How the Penrith community is using rugby league to educate youth and fight the stereotypes When a couple of deadly gangland shootings took place in western Sydney recently, and headlines rang out at the same time that junior rugby league matches would be scrapped ""amid gang violence concerns"", two stereotypes came crashing together. NSW Police even went so far as to issue a statement refuting any link between a cancelled Penrith Districts match in early May with the bikie gang shootings. Rugby league and the western suburbs both struggle to break free of negative reputations earned unfairly, according to those who both play the game and live in the region. Kerby Breust has three sons who have grown up playing rugby league. She has volunteered her time for the past 12 years, currently managing the U13 team one of her sons plays in. ""You know what, it's a game of rugby league. Everyone's here to play, it's their friendships and mates and not getting into trouble, just really hanging around a good group of boys that just want to be there and have fun,"" Breust told The Ticket. Speaking on the sidelines of her son's game over the weekend, Breust issued an invitation to those who hadn't been to the western suburbs of Sydney or seen a game of kids rugby league. ""Come out to those suburbs, have a look, they're not as bad as what you think. Yeah, they get a bad reputation because of their name…there's only a handful within those districts, I would say, that do wreck it for some kids. Everyone is pretty decent."" Amanda Cooper has been volunteering for 15 years and was watching the same junior game at Blacktown Workers Stadium. She believes the bad wrap sometimes given to the game and the western suburbs is unfair. ""Sometimes you get the odd one where there could be an issue, but honestly it's like 99 per cent good, one per cent bad from what I've seen in my last 15 years,"" Cooper said, adding it's a tight community that steps up when ever one of them is in need. ""Everyone knows everyone. Everyone has probably full-time jobs and then they volunteer their time on top of that…they'll hop in, they'll pick up kids, drop off kids, look after people's children. You've got trades people they'll often help each other out, that sort of thing."" Penrith Districts and Junior Rugby League is the heartland of the code in Australia. Nationally, almost one in 10 who play the game are based there. Penrith District boasts 25 separate clubs, operating 580 teams catering to under six years of age through to senior level. Inspiring many of the juniors is the NRL team, the Penrith Panthers — currently on top of the ladder and on target to defend their premiership crown. Unlike many other professional NRL teams, the Panthers overwhelmingly boasts local, homegrown talent. They also make up a fair portion of the champion NSW State of Origin team. The club runs the Panthers on the Prowl Foundation, established 15 years ago to help provide opportunities and support for school age children from the area at risk of emotional, social or physical harm. Thousands of kids have completed workshops, and according to one of the counsellors, Brogan Mulhall, the positive outcomes are measurable. He says the issues faced by young people in Penrith are not any different to others of their age. ""In terms of the social issues and the issues that young people are facing in Penrith, they are exactly the same as what they would be anywhere else around the state,"" Mulhall said. ""There'd be idiosyncrasies around what each community faces but generally we are seeing at the moment, especially after two years of COVID, that it's very difficult for young people to feel connected and engaged at school or in the wider community or sometimes even within their family. ""We put them through a number of different programs…they are really about social and emotional competency and creating opportunities where in situations otherwise might not be there."" In the past week, Penrith was the first club to sign onto an NRL commitment to a new program established with the NSW Police Youth Command to offer young people at risk of anti-social behaviour or criminal offending, the opportunity to engage in sport through Police Citizens Youth Clubs (PCYC). Other sports such as Aussie rules, netball, football and cricket have also signed on to the Sporting Partnership Industry Program. George Kambosos Jr's upset win over Teófimo López has attracted widespread praise, with young prospect Harry Garside hoping it will spark a golden era of Australian boxing. Speaking at the launch NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb said it was an extension of the Fit for Life program, an early intervention program designed to engage at-risk youths across the state. ""It gets them involved in sport, engaged in activities at a PCYC and divert them and offer them something different, a life possibly away from crime."" Retired rugby league legend, now boxer, Sonny Bill Williams is one of the athlete ambassadors, as is united lightweight boxing champion George Kambosos Jr. ""There are a lot of people that work in the community and PCYC that have a vested interest in the kids,"" Williams said. ""Not just improving them from a physical point of view but improving them as people."" Kambosos said the PCYC holds a special place in his heart given the difference it made in his own life. ""I'm very proud to say that I started my career at the Rockdale-St George PCYC,"" Kambosos said. ""Without having that place maybe I would not have become a world champion because that gave me a home, it gave me somewhere to be every day…and to not be on the streets and not be getting into trouble."" According to the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOSCAR) Penrith – along with some of the other local government areas often associated with crime in the mainstream media – showed no increase in any major offences over the two years to December 2021. Criminal offending by young people was way down on historic levels with the number of young people charged by police considerably lower than for any year in the previous decade. BOSCAR's executive director Jackie Fitzgerald says it is impossible to measure ""gang related crime"" but there are crimes that might loosely fit gang-related offences — such as murder, shooting, and offending by youths. She says on the most recent data there is no evidence of any increase in such activity. ""Certainly, many of them are at historic lows in NSW,"" Ms Fitzgerald told The Ticket. ""In terms of the relative level of crime in Penrith it is slightly higher than the state average."" When it comes to specific crimes, assault in Penrith is around 30 per cent higher than the state average and property crime is slightly higher than the state average. ""But [it's] certainly not an area that would be the highest concentration of crime but probably on the wrong side of the state average. ""I'm sure there are some local concerns in that area, but we wouldn't rank it amongst the top communities for crime."" Internationally recognised criminologist, Distinguished Professor Rob White, has presented often on the complexities of defining gangs: They tend to form in working class neighbourhoods where economically life is tough and opportunities are limited…Certain neighbourhoods have foisted upon them negative reputations, while particular youths become targets for police attention and media vilification. Studying gangs is thus basically about studying communities, about determining who is connected to whom, how and why. It is about the ways in which masculinity is constructed on the streets, and how social respect is gained and lost through physicality and violence. Sport is often held up as an alternative track for those who might find themselves mixing in the wrong crowd and making bad decisions. But how does sport guard itself from becoming another toxic environment? ""The way I see that is rugby league is a really healthy host and these types of gangs and violence that hover around the edges are kind of parasitical,"" Panthers on the Prowl's Brogan Mulhall says. ""They feed off people coming together. I can nearly guarantee you 99 per cent of issues happening around those games are not the players, and not the coaches, and not the people involved. ""It's the parasites around that attach themselves to that healthy host in looking to feed their own agenda. ""And their own agenda unfortunately is really about … lots of fearful, scared young boys that have grown into fearful, scared young men and feel like the only way they can exert their masculinity, and the only way they can really explore their masculinity is through violence."" Mulhall has spent several years working with aid organisations in areas like the slums of Sao Paulo in Brazil and in the southern African nation of Zambia. ""One of the key differences over there is the cultural connections are still quite strong. Things like rites of passage from boyhood into adulthood still exist in a very strong, cultural way. ""One of the biggest things I notice with our boys here is that they get lost once they get that age of independence and feeling like they need to explore their own identity, like all young people do but particularly boys. ""There is a real dearth of capacity for young people to really find out and connect with a broader group of men or other boys to explore what that looks like … what does that transition from boyhood to adulthood look like?"" ""Because of that cultural void we have in our society, and it's not just Penrith, it's in a lot of white Australian communities. ""That void is easily picked up by things like gangs, or social media, and they look for another way to try to explore their identity and one of the things we try to do through our work is provide programs that offer that opportunity for connection to explore what that means to be a quality young man, explore what it means to be a young person with responsibilities and respect for the people around you."" It's a challenge Penrith's rugby league community continues to tackle head-on, often at odds with the stereotypes and headlines.

81,Eritrea's Binian Girmay makes cycling history at Giro — and then abandons the race,sport," Sport Eritrea's Biniam Girmay wins stage 10 of Giro D'Italia in sprint finish, forced to abandon after eye injury It's been a season of firsts for Biniam Girmay, and the Eritrean rider added a stage victory in the Giro d'Italia in his first Grand Tour — but the victory proved a painful and costly one after his celebrations landed him in hospital and later ruled him out of the race. The 22-year-old Girmay outsprinted none other than Mathieu van der Poel — one of the top riders in the sport — to win the 10th stage. Now he's the first black African to win a stage at the Giro, and second African overall after Alan van Heerden won in nearby Pesaro in 1979. ""I realise I'm making history but it's thanks to my team and my family,"" Girmay said. ""I'm really grateful to them."" Girmay was then to a local hospital after getting injured when he popped a champagne cork into his eye during the podium celebration. He later rejoined his team to continue celebrating the win, but La Gazetta dello Sport reported on Wednesday morning that he would not start the 11th stage. This was later confirmed in a post from Girmay via his Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert team. ""Today, I didn't start the race because still my eye needs some rest,"" he said. ""I was a bit sad about what happened with the champagne,"" he added, saying that he was still able to celebrate with his teammates after the race. Spanish rider Juan Pedro López of the Trek-Segafredo team maintained his 12-second lead over João Almeida in the overall standings as the three-week race approached the halfway stage. Romain Bardet is 14 seconds back. In March, Girmay became the first rider from a sub-Saharan country to win a single-day classic when he triumphed in the Gent-Wevelgem race. The first half of the 196-kilometre leg from Pescara to Jesi was mainly flat along the Adriatic coast before three fourth-category climbs later in the day. Several riders attacked without success on the final climb to Monsano and the ensuing descent. Girmay nearly missed a turn on the descent but was able to recover in time to rejoin the leaders for the finale. Jai Hindley, runner up at the 2020 Giro d'Italia, showed he has the form to challenge for a second Grand Tour podium after an impressive first week, while Caleb Ewan's chances for stage wins are running out. Girmay started his sprint early and Van der Poel pulled even with him at one point. Then Girmay stepped up the pace and Van der Poel — realising he had no answer — flashed a thumbs-up toward Girmay before the pair crossed the line. The Dutchman was also the first rider to give Girmay a congratulatory hug. Girmay, who rides for the Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux team, completed the stage in slightly more than four and a half hours. Van der Poel and Vincenzo Albanese crossed second and third, respectively, both with the same time as Girmay. Stage 11 on Wednesday is an entirely flat 203-kilometre (126-mile) leg from Santarcangelo Di Romagna to Reggio Emilia. The race ends on May 29 in Verona.

82,Invention that signals 'we shouldn't be playing this late' saves community's basketball ring,sport,"  Coburg basketball ring gets innovative upgrade after night noise complaints A public basketball hoop in Melbourne's north has been saved by the innovative thinking of a council worker and two industrial design students. The hoop in Coburg's Bush Reserve was removed after police and council received several complaints about the noise of late-night basketballers disrupting residents between 10pm and 2am. ""We want young people to have a good time, but to do it in a way that is a bit more respectful of those living nearby,"" Moreland City Council Mayor Mark Riley said. ""There are other sites where they can go that aren't so close to residents."" After verbal warnings were not enough to keep the late-night noise at bay the hoop was removed in July 2021. Determined to find a way to reinstall the ring, a council worker investigated what existing technology was available to automatically remove the hoop at night and return it during daylight hours. When he couldn't find any workable solutions on the market, he approached a number of Melbourne universities seeking a solution. Monash University industrial design students Marcell Aryananda and Jules Kabore were told about the brief and took up the design challenge. After researching various possible solutions and the cost, the pair came up with a relatively simple and inexpensive design. ""It's essentially a pole that extends out at certain times in the middle of the hoop to stop the ball going through,"" Mr Kabore said. ""But it is also a social cue that we shouldn't be playing this late."" The pole is connected to a circuit board which is programmed to extend the pole at 10pm and retract it at 8am. Mr Aryananda said it was powered by a battery and a solar panel. ""We have an internal clock to support that circuit board, so it knows what time it is,"" he said. The device was installed in early April and has performed well so far. All up the materials cost $1,200. ""I am relieved that it is working,"" Mr Aryananda said. ""The project has been really fulfilling honestly."" Mr Riley says it is a ""win-win"" for everybody. ""The local residents are really pleased with it, but the young ones kind of get it as well,"" he said. Moreland City Council is keen to try out refined versions of the invention at two other sites within the municipality. ""I was really impressed by the students' thinking,"" Mr Riley said. For Mr Aryananda and Mr Kabore, it was also a great opportunity to kickstart their careers. ""As young designers it's quite difficult to enter into the field,"" Mr Kabore said. ""The fact they were willing to help us in every regard and sponsor us through this has been great. ""We are not offered these opportunities very often.""

83,All eyes on Australian Swimming Championships with Commonwealth Games campaign looming,sport," Sport Australian Swimming Championships a guide to medal success at the Commonwealth Games A couple of times every four years, Australians become diehard swimming fans – arguably the one international sport in which we can truly take on the world and win. It happened at last year's Olympic Games where the likes of Emma McKeon, Ariarne Titmus, Kaylee McKeown and Zac Stubblety-Cook scooped the Tokyo pool. For a little over a week, our swimmers – particularly the women – blitzed the field, bringing home an extraordinary haul of medals, gladdening the hearts of Australians worn down by the COVID lockdowns. Just one year later, the Birmingham Commonwealth Games are looming, and on Wednesday in Adelaide the Australian Swimming Championships begin, doubling as trials for the Games in July and World Championships in Budapest one month earlier. While we'll see the return of most of our Tokyo superstars, all eyes will be on Shayna Jack, who's aiming to make her first Australian team since the end of her two-year doping ban. It starts on Wednesday night with Jack swimming in the 100m freestyle events in great form – she has the fastest time in the world this year over 100m. Later in the week she'll compete in the 50m freestyle, holding the third-fastest time in the world this year. Jack is one of the young women who'll have the chance to shine at these trials – it's the first time in more than a decade that a major Australian swimming meet won't feature either McKeon or Cate and Bronte Campbell. Both of the Campbell sisters are taking a year off. And McKeon, just a year after becoming Australia's most successful Olympian, is skipping the trials and the World Championships, but she does plan to compete at the Commonwealth Games She has automatic entry into the Games courtesy of her medals at the Olympics. Cate Campbell won the Australian 100m freestyle title seven times before she was finally toppled by McKeon last year. So the door is open tonight for the likes of Jack as well as Mollie O'Callaghan, Madison Wilson and Meg Harrison, who all won relay gold medals in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay with the Campbell sisters and McKeon, to swim without the dominant women of the past decade next to them. It means Australia will field a very different women's relay teams at the World Championships come June and the Commonwealth Game. Adding some intrigue, Australia's Olympic gold medallist in the 200m and 400m freestyle events, Titmus, will also race in the 100m tonight. Like McKeon, Titmus will miss the World Championships and focus entirely on the Commonwealth Games. Another Tokyo multiple gold medallist, McKeown, will swim the 200m and 400m individual medley races as well as her pet backstroke events. After breaking the world record in the 100m backstroke at least year's Olympic trials, McKeown is flying again with the two fastest times in the world this year. Returning to the pool tonight will be the Rio 400m freestyle gold medallist, Mack Horton, who’s looking to respark his career after missing out on selection for Tokyo. At 26, Horton has left his long-time coach, Craig Jackson, to join the successful squad of Michael Bohl in Queensland. Veteran swimming journalist Ian Hanson of the Swimming World Magazine says there is excitement about some up and coming young women. Hanson highlighted another two backstrokers, Minna Atherton and Tahlia Thornton, as ones to watch, as well as Alexandria Perkins in the 100m butterfly. On the men's side, Hanson said there's huge excitement about 16-year-old Queensland freestyler Flynn Southam. ""Flynn Southam, he is going to be something else, particularly the way he races. He's got a really strong back end,"" Hanson said. Last month, Southam broke the 16-years Australian age record that Kyle Chalmers set in 2015 just one year before his historic Rio Olympics Gold Medal. Southam's time of 48.60 was even faster than the times Tokyo Gold medallist, Caleb Dressel, was swimming at the same age. At the same meet he got within eight-tenths of a second of Ian Thorpe's Australian 1999 16-years age record in the 200m freestyle. ""He can negative split (swimming faster in the second half of the race) or go close to negative split,"" said Hanson. ""That's an exciting thing for a young boy. He's an absolutely exciting prospect."" Australia's 100m freestyle silver medallist at Tokyo, Kyle Chalmers, is having a low-key championship. The Rio Gold Medallist had shoulders surgery in December and will only swim in the butterfly events – which counterintuitively places less stress on the joint. Chalmers will be swimming in the 100m butterfly tonight alongside Matt Temple, who set a new Australian record at last year's Olympic trials. Temple finished fifth in the event at the Olympics, returning with two bronze medals in relays. The pop singer turned swimmer, Cody Simpson, is a chance to make the Commonwealth Games in the 100 fly. The Tokyo Olympics were a massive high for the Dolphins and with another chance to shine on the world stage at the Commonwealth Games in July, Australia's swimmers will be desperate to nail a spot on the team. Will we see McKeown break another world record? Or will the young guns knock off their seasoned rivals? The championships will be streamed on Amazon Prime.

84,What would Matthew Mott's departure mean for our Australian Women's Cricket Team?,sport," Sport What would Matthew Mott's departure mean for our successful Australian Women's Cricket Team? Increasing reports suggest Matthew Mott is the frontrunner likely to be appointed as the new England men's cricket team's white-ball head coach. Last week, the ECB officially announced Kiwi Brendon McCullum would oversee the Test side on four-year deal, but the board has yet to commit to someone for the shorter formats. At the time of writing, that decision was expected to be a two-man race between interim coach Paul Collingwood and Mott. The Australian has been at the helm of our world No.1 women's team since 2015 and is currently contracted until September 2023. It's the second time this year Mott's been linked to a men's national side, after being touted as a replacement for Justin Langer following his resignation in February. In late March, while in the middle of leading the Australian women to the 2022 Women's World Cup trophy, Mott was asked if he'd thought about throwing his hat in the ring. In response, Mott revealed that he'd certainly considered crossing over, but that he was in no rush to leave his current post. ""A lot of people think it's a step up to go into the men's program. I think it's a step across,"" he said. ""As a coach, you have to look at the next pathway … there will always be that: 'What's next?' … But I'm thoroughly enjoying what I'm doing at the moment."" Now it seems he'll switch focus, not only when it comes to gender, but also in allegiance for country. However, Mott is a much-loved member of the cricket community, and fans are unlikely to bear any resentment if he does indeed move on. After seven years in charge, you can understand why Mott may be looking for a new challenge, seemingly having achieved everything possible in the women's international game. During that time, Australia has held the Women's Ashes for the past four series, set a new world record for the longest ODI-winning streak in men or women's cricket (26 straight) and, as of last month, have won three World Cups in limited-overs formats, including that unforgettable night in 2020 at the MCG. It's also interesting to reflect on the rise of the women's game since Mott started in the job in March 2015, the same year the Women's Big Bash was launched, and a year before the NSW Breakers became the first full-time professionally paid team in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL). Now the WBBL is a high-rating TV product, with last season reaching a cumulative average audience of 5.36 million viewers, setting the standard for other women's sports around the country when it comes to interest and sponsorship. The WNCL has also come a long way, building towards a full home-and-away season for the first time this summer with an additional $7,000 on average in match payments. Mott's influence cannot be discounted throughout this period, as a passionate advocate for the rights of female players and their worth. Plus, the success of the team, thanks to his guidance, has pushed those in charge to keep upping the standards of the women's pathways and their investment in the game. At times, some have been critical of Mott's decisions to favour all-round capabilities when it comes to selection. Opting to pick players who can field, bat and bowl, rather than a specialist knocking down the door with incredible form. He's also shown loyalty to players already in the Australian set-up, trusting their ability to come good based on previous performances when they've had an extended dip in form. Despite others missing out for these reasons, the incredible success of the team under his tenure means the approach has, by and large, paid off. So how would the team do without Mott involved? Australia already has a strong senior leadership group, possessing some of the best players in the world. Meg Lanning has been captain since 2014 and shows no sign of slowing down, while experienced campaigners Rachael Haynes, Alyssa Healy, Ellyse Perry, Jess Jonassen, Megan Schutt and Beth Mooney are all likely to help the side through its period of transition. Lanning and Mott have always had a particularly collaborative approach in the direction of the team and their tactics on field, meaning it's likely whomever replaces Mott will need to share that temperament and co-operative quality. Although he's not gone just yet, there are a number of Australian coaches waiting in the wings. Former Australian all-rounder Shelley Nitschke has been working full-time as an assistant under Mott for the past four years, and is the head coach of 2021 WBBL champions, the Perth Scorchers. During an international career that spanned from 2004 to 2011, Nitschke represented Australia at four World Cups and won trophies in both the 50-overs (2005) and T20 (2010) formats. Nitschke was named as the ICC Women's Cricketer of the Year in 2010 and won the Belinda Clark Award four years in a row, from 2009 to 2012. As someone who played six Test matches, Nitschke's experience would be invaluable in an era where women's cricket is seeking to play more of the traditional format. Other strong candidates include Ben Sawyer and Jo Broadbent. Sawyer is the second assistant coach currently operating under Mott and has a strong relationship with multiple players from his seven seasons in charge at the Sydney Sixers in the WBBL. He won two back-to-back titles in WBBL02 and WBBL03. According to Ellyse Perry, he was an integral figure for Australia's victory in the 2019 Ashes. After working part-time with the national side in previous series, Sawyer was appointed full-time in 2021. Meanwhile Broadbent, like Nitschke, is a former Australian batter, well-known as our first female player to reach a double century in Tests (1998). Broadbent led the NSW Breakers to six WNCL titles in the space of seven years and won the inaugural season of the WBBL as the Sydney Thunder's head coach. Nowadays, Broadbent is coaching Northern Districts in New Zealand, as she aims to help grow the game elsewhere, but Cricket Australia could probably lure her back across the ditch, especially if it means coaching the national side she once played for.

The three-time Norm Smith medallist is two games back from his six-week break from the AFL due to personal reasons. Martin took a leave of absence from Richmond after the Tigers' round-one loss against Carlton as he continued to grieve the death of his father last December. Rumours floated around about the 30-year-old wanting to live a more private life outside an AFL-obsessed state and move to Sydney. Hardwick on Tuesday addressed the possibility of Martin finishing his illustrious 263-game career away from Punt Rd. ""He's a very important player to our footy club, on the field and off the field,"" Hardwick said ahead of Richmond's Dreamtime at the 'G blockbuster. ""What he gives us, he's paid us in spades. ""Whatever Dustin's decision is moving forward is up to Dustin and to be honest, he has my blessing. ""What he's given me, us, our fans, he has been incredible and whatever we get from here on in is a bonus. ""I'm just lucky I get to see him on a weekly basis perform and train the way he does. ""He was a bit sore last week, he'd never put up his hand and say he was a little bit underdone. ""He's a required Richmond player and a very important Richmond player."" Hardwick hailed Martin's influence in victories over Collingwood and Hawthorn as the Brownlow medallist played mainly as a forward. ""The way this guy prepares physically and mentally is first-class, it's what the great ones do,"" Hardwick said. ""There's no coincidence the work he puts in gets rewarded with his on-field performances. ""Even after [Tuesday's training] session, he's doing extra running because that's the sort of performer he is. ""We use him as an example for our young blokes, 'listen, you want to reach that level, first of all, good luck but this is how you go about it.'""

86,"'I don't read textbooks, I read my athletes': Is Dean Boxall the best coach in swimming? Ariarne Titmus thinks so",sport,"  Dean Boxall and Ariarne Titmus team up again for the 2022 Australian Swimming Championships. Are they the best duo in sport? Australian swimming's golden girl thinks she has the best coach in the sport. In fact, Ariarne Titmus thinks Dean Boxall is the best coach in any sport. You might remember Boxall completely blowing his stack at the Tokyo Olympics when Titmus stormed home past the legendary Katie Ledecky to win gold in the 400m freestyle. Aside from being excellent meme fodder, Boxall is something of a swimming swami. Just ask Titmus. ""I can't really speak for anyone else but I believe that my relationship with Dean is probably the best athlete-coach bond you can have,"" Titmus told the ABC. ""I feel like we're best mates outside of him being my coach as well, which is really good. ""Like you know when we're at the pool, it's coach/athlete, and then outside of that we are best friends, which I think works really well for us."" Titmus and Boxall are now setting their sights on the 2022 Australian Swimming Championships, which start tomorrow in Adelaide, and it's clear the 21-year-old superstar only wants one man in her corner. ""I trust him with my life, and I think that makes it easy for us to work together,"" she said. ""He's such a unique individual, there's no-one else like him out there, so I think that when we work really well together. ""I'm gonna have no other relationship like that with anyone else, so I'm really grateful to have met Dean and to work with him and have him by my side."" The laconic Boxall is slightly less effusive than his swimmer, but clearly puts his athletes — their dreams, their success, their wellbeing — above all else. When told Titmus believes they are the best athlete-coach duo in sport, the 45-year-old has a wry smile. ""Arnie might need to check some other sports. I think Rafael and Toni were pretty good. I mean, we've got a very good relationship,"" he says, giving a glimpse of his tennis knowledge. But he points out the bond forged between he and Titmus didn't happen overnight. ""That [closeness] is why I can push her and she doesn't take offence to any of that. ""But, you know, it's something that's been developed, it wasn't just click the fingers. ""You have to have a lot of trust. That comes with a lot of responsibility as well. ""I mean, she's a great girl but I have a great relationship with most of the guys in the squad, and you have to form that. ""You walk that athlete down to the marshalling area, to the Olympics — that is the best walk that you can do with someone, other than going down the aisle, I guess,"" he says, laughing. ""There's a lot of dreams on the line. So you have to dream with them."" Anyone swimmer or coach who watched Titmus's brilliantly executed swim to topple Ledecky in Tokyo would realise how much thought and planning — not to mention hard work — that would have been required to achieve that moment. But Boxall's undoubted tactical genius doesn't come from a book or a course. ""I don't go and read textbooks, I read my athletes,"" he says. ""I read the event. I read the competitors. And I'll try and create something. ""I don't do courses. I just read my guys and the sport that's around. I don't think that's a secret."" Boxall relishes his work coaching the St Peter's Western Swim Club for major meets like these national championships. Some of his other charges include Elijah Winnington, Shayna Jack and Molly O'Callaghan, and Boxall says he has a unique relationship with each one of them. ""Some people think it's a job. It's not a job. ""A job is you get up and you go, 'oh I have Mondayitis'. I don't have Mondayitis, I actually look forward to coming in and seeing the guys, being around them. ""I think they're a great group. I believe in them. They believe in me. ""They believe in St Peters Western. They can't wait to represent Australia. I just love representing Australia, I think it's the greatest thing that you can do."" Boxall says the Olympics were ""weird"". He describes the strange feeling of climbing the mountain that is the Olympic Games and then just coming home through COVID isolation and rolling into the next part of the season. Ariarne Titmus's stunning swim in the 400 metre freestyle has had Australians cheering — none more so than coach Dean Boxall, whose intense ""Ultimate Warrior"" celebration has gone viral. ""Because the Olympics was so different, you know, we finished the competition, within 24 hours we're on a chartered flight. ""No alcohol, straight into Howard springs, no alcohol, basically in like a small room. Just waiting to get out. Didn't have an opportunity to have a steak with my mates or beer, or even reflect with the athletes a bit — we were all in different compartments."" Did he mention there was no alcohol? Boxall says his Hulk-berserker moment was the culmination of all the tension leading up to the Olympics and that particular event. ""I think the moment when I released myself was because of so much build-up, you know Arnie had to deal with a shoulder injury, there's a lot of pressure, you know NBC actually flew out to basically pitch this race as the big race of the Olympics, not just for swimming. ""Even trying to get there through COVID. Like, that was another sort of pressure and stress-out to deal with, having to wear masks, and we had testing every day. And if someone got COVID, they couldn't fly. ""So actually, it was just this massive release. And the race panned out perfectly as we predicted."" He says people connected through that moment amid the fear and isolation of the pandemic. ""I think it was probably like a perfect storm. People were in lockdown watching, probably feeling [they were] wanting to get out the joy watching that race as well. ""That moment with Arnie, it was like a moment where those people in the lounge who are watching, they could stand up and jump and cheer for Australia. I think that is the greatest thing that you can give someone.""

87,AFLW start date expected to be announced within days,sport," Sport AFLW start date expected to be announced within days The start date of the next AFLW season will be announced within days, following a breakthrough in negotiations with the players' union. AFLW clubs have been given provisional dates for the competition, which will move from a summer slot to an August start date. The delay in revealing the exact start date has been criticised by many AFLW players. But AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said negotiations over a fresh AFLW collective bargaining agreement with the players' union were almost complete. ""I am confident we will get an arrangement in the next 24, 36 hours,"" McLachlan told reporters in Adelaide on Monday. ""It's important that we have the right outcome for our female players and also for the 18 clubs … and for female football generally. ""I hope people understand that the moving to an early start date without a collective bargaining [agreement], these things take some time. ""Players know we will be playing in August. Clubs have been given provisional dates. ""We're close … I am optimistic we will have an announcement in the next day or so."" Four new clubs will enter the AFLW next season, making it an 18-team competition. Last season's league was a nine-round competition followed by finals which ended with an April 9 grand final. Players want more rounds, given the increased number of clubs, but McLachlan hinted that wish might not be granted. ""Broadly speaking, the female playing cohort want to play a longer season,"" McLachlan said. ""It's also our view [that] we're bringing four more teams on board and we want to consolidate before we expand. ""That is obviously something we have been discussing. ""It's a real issue for the female players, I know that … it is obviously something that has been a key part of the discussions."" Meanwhile, expansion team Hawthorn has lured Tilly Lucas-Rodd (St Kilda), Jess Duffin (North Melbourne), Janet Baird (Gold Coast) and Akec Makur Chuot (Richmond) from rival clubs for its inaugural AFLW season. Join Sam Lane and Sharni Norder as they talk all things AFLW in a podcast that is equal parts insight, raw honesty and general madness.

The 32-year-old has also been a successful cricketer, captaining the Melbourne Renegades in the WBBL. The expansion comes ahead of a new documentary series titled Fearless: The Inside Story of the AFLW launching next year. The series, announced by The Walt Disney Company, and the AFL, will spotlight the Adelaide Crows, Collingwood, GWS Giants, and Western Bulldogs, and will feature behind-the-scenes footage and exclusive player interviews.

88,Jack Nicklaus turned down $100m offer to join Saudi-backed golf tournament,sport,"  Golfing great Jack Nicklaus turned down $100 million offer to join Saudi-backed LIV Invitational golf tournament Golfing great Jack Nicklaus turned down an offer worth more than $100 million to be the face of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf Invitational Series that is hoping to challenge the PGA Tour, which the 82-year-old helped popularise. Nicklaus, who counts a record 18 major titles among his 73 PGA Tour wins, said in an article on the Fire Pit Collective website on Monday that organisers of the series asked him to spearhead the big-money circuit. ""I was offered something in excess of $100 million by the Saudis, to do the job probably similar to the one that Greg (Norman) is doing,"" Nicklaus said in the report. ""I turned it down. Once verbally, once in writing. I said, 'Guys, I have to stay with the PGA Tour. I helped start the PGA Tour."" World Golf Hall-of-Famer Norman serves as chief executive of LIV Golf and has become the public face of the tournament. The Australian came under fire last week when he downplayed the 2018 killing of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying: ""We've all made mistakes."" The LIV Golf Invitational Series, which will feature an individual and team concept, is scheduled to hold its inaugural event season June 9-11 at Centurion Club outside London, with a total prize purse for the eight-event season of $255 million. The PGA Tour last week denied the conflicting event releases for those members who sought to play at Centurion that same week as its RBC Canadian Open in Toronto. Six-times major champion Phil Mickelson, who stepped away from the game in February amid fallout from comments he made regarding a Saudi-backed golf league, is among the players who had requested releases into the first LIV Golf event. Mickelson's public image took a hit when the author of an unauthorised biography on the long-time fan favourite said the golfer told him he was willing to look past Saudi Arabia's human rights record to gain leverage with the PGA Tour. Saudi Arabia's government has denied accusations of human rights abuses and Mickelson later apologised for the comments, which he claimed were off the record, and then said he planned to take time away from the sport. ""My advice to Phil? My advice to Phil would be to be patient,"" Nicklaus said. ""The world is a very forgiving place.

89,"Blackpool's Jake Daniels, inspired by Adelaide's United Josh Cavallo, comes out as gay",sport," Sport Blackpool's Jake Daniels, inspired by Adelaide's United Josh Cavallo, comes out as gay Blackpool striker Jake Daniels has become the first active professional male footballer in England to come out as gay in more than 30 years. The 17-year-old said he was inspired by the example of Adelaide United midfielder Josh Cavallo, who became the first openly gay male player in a top-flight competition when he came out last year. ""I've hated lying my whole life and feeling the need to change to fit in,"" Daniels said on Blackpool's website. ""I want to be a role model myself by doing this. There are people out there in the same space as me that may not feel comfortable revealing their sexuality. ""I just want to tell them that you don't have to change who you are, or how you should be, just to fit in. You being you, and being happy, is what matters most."" Daniels said his teammates at Blackpool had embraced his sexuality after he confided in them several months ago. Club spokespeople said they were ""incredibly proud that he has reached a stage where he is empowered to express himself both on and off the pitch"". The announcement has been met with a similar wave of support to what Cavallo received last October. England's Football Association said Daniels was an ""inspiration"". ""This is a hugely positive step as we strive to build an inclusive game that we can all be proud of,"" the governing body tweeted. ""We are with you and we hope your story will help to give people across the game the strength and encouragement to be their true self."" Former England footballers Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher described it as a ""historic"" moment, while other organisations including the Premier League, FIFA, and FIFPro all expressed their support for Daniels. ""This season has been a fantastic one for me on the pitch,"" Daniels said in a statement. ""But off the pitch I've been hiding the real me and who I really am. I've known my whole life that I'm gay, and I now feel that I'm ready to come out and be myself. ""It's a step into the unknown but I've been inspired by Josh Cavallo, [England non-league player] Matt Morton, and athletes from other sports, like [diver] Tom Daley, to have the courage and determination to drive change."" The only openly gay man to have previously played as a full-time professional in England was Justin Fashanu. However, he was playing non-league when he made the announcement in 1990 before later reviving his career at Torquay. The former Nottingham Forest and Norwich City striker took his own life aged 37. More recently, German Thomas Hitzlsperger, who played at Aston Villa, and American Robbie Rogers, who played for Leeds, have come out after leaving the English game. Daniels said he had been thinking for a long time about how to tell his story, and living a lie had been affecting his mental health. ""For a long time I've thought I would have to hide my truth because I wanted to be, and now I am, a professional footballer,"" he said. ""I asked myself if I should wait until I've retired to come out. ""However, I knew that would lead to a long time of lying and not being able to be myself or lead the life that I want to."" Daniels said his mother and sister had reacted by saying, ""Yeah, we already knew."" ""The day after I told my mum and sister, we played Accrington (under-18s) and I scored four goals, so it just shows how much of a weight off the shoulders and what a massive relief it was,"" he said.

90,From laggards to leaders: How Melbourne Victory turned A-League humiliation into triumph,sport," Sport How Melbourne Victory turned A-League humiliation into triumph It's April 2021. Melbourne Victory have just suffered an embarrassing 7-0 loss to Melbourne City, the second thrashing by their rivals in as many months. Coach Grant Brebner is sacked. The fans are hurting. A once-proud club has hit rock bottom. Fast-forward a little more than 12 months and it's a vastly different story. Victory have just missed out on being crowned premiers after finishing second on the A-League Men's table, capping off a remarkable turnaround for a club which languished at the bottom of the table in 2021. They now take a 15-game unbeaten run into the finals — a club record — and a side overflowing with confidence. So, just how have they come from the doldrums to arguably the championship favourite? For emerging midfielder Jake Brimmer, there was a defining moment when he knew Victory's fortunes would change. ""It was the minute the boss was announced as head coach of the Melbourne Victory Football Club,"" 24-year-old Brimmer told ABC Sport. The ""boss"" is Tony Popovic, a former Socceroo with an extensive coaching resume. Popovic led two A-League clubs to premiership titles and won the prestigious AFC Champions League with the Western Sydney Wanderers. ""As soon as [Popovic] was announced as head coach, that was when I knew that the club was going to change and that we'll be right back up there where we belong,"" Brimmer said, having previously played under Popovic at Perth Glory. Brimmer's confidence this season is indicative of the team's performance and the star midfielder said it's Popovic who has instilled that belief. ""I knew the expectations … and we've all really jumped on board to what he wanted, and you can see with the results and how everyone's playing,"" Brimmer said. ""It's all coming together as one now right before the finals. We're in a good headspace and everyone's flying."" Brimmer's first season with Victory was last year when the club's woes were laid bare on and off the field. ""Look, it's not something that I like to think about, having been a part of that team, but it's amazing how quickly things can turn around,"" he said. ""It wasn't a very good spot for me, personally, because — as a footballer — I like to win things, win trophies … so it was a really dark spot. ""You fast-forward 12 months and look at us now. I'm so happy for everyone at the club, especially for the fans because they've had to sit through two years of heartache and stress and now we're finally on the right path."" ""Last year was a terrible season,"" admitted Victory's managing director, Caroline Carnegie. ""Everyone felt it: the coach, the players, the administration. Everybody rides the bumps of football together and it was just a terrible feeling around the place,"" she said. In the immediate aftermath of season 2021, Victory cleared out its troubled football department and administration, appointing a new director of football in John Didulica. Carnegie became part of that transformation, stepping in as managing director to become the first woman to lead the administration of a men's club in the Australian Professional Leagues. A lawyer by trade, Carnegie said the clean-out helped to exorcise the demons of the 2021 season. ""The broad nature of the changes we've had through administration and football meant that we had a clean slate from that [terrible] feeling,"" she said. ""Everybody was certainly very disappointed in last year and even the year before that, of course, but just coming in with a fresh way of doing things through administration and football … really made a difference."" Carnegie has the unenviable task of placating a sometimes angry fan base, which has toiled through poor performances and COVID-19 restrictions. The most ardent of supporters showed up at a training session last year with a sign that read: ""The line has been crossed."" ""Look, I hope [the fans] are feeling pretty good right about now,"" Carnegie said. ""What we've tried to do very hard this year is make sure our fans, members and active supporters are on the journey."" Carnegie cited bringing all games — and fans — back to its home venue, AAMI Park, as a crucial change. Brimmer believes Victory can go all the way and etch a fifth championship onto the club's honour board. ""With this team and with this manager I believe that sky's the limit with us,"" he said. ""We all jumped on board with what the boss wants and I genuinely believe that we can most definitely go all the way and completely win it."" Victory will face stiff opposition from cross-town rivals Western United, defending champions Melbourne City and the in-form Adelaide United. The top three sides on the premiership ladder this season were all based in Melbourne, in a sign of progress for football in the city. Victory face off against Western United in the first of two semi-finals tonight.

91,"As Socceroos ponder potential World Cup absence, high cost for parents hurts next generation",sport," Sport As Socceroos ponder potential World Cup absence, high cost for parents hurts next generation Adisu Bayew is one of Australia's most promising footballers, who this season scored his first A-League Men's goal for Western United and debuted for the Olyroos. But for a code staring at the possibility of a World Cup absence this year and wondering what must be done to improve the quality of the next generation, Bayew represents something more significant. In a sport that charges parents of promising teenagers upwards of $1,000 per season, Bayew and his peers in Western Melbourne are bucking the trend. The 20-year-old has been part of the program at Football Empowerment, a community organisation in Melbourne set up to find professional opportunities for those whose parents can't afford to push them through expensive club academies. Tom Yabio, managing director of the not-for-profit which relies on local and state government grants, said he and his team set up the organisation in 2016 after realising many promising players in Western Melbourne weren't playing in the usually expensive junior National Premier League (NPL) system. ""Costs limit the players playing at National Premier League clubs, creating a barrier for participation, and players will drop out of the elite pathway,"" he said. The pain associated with the high cost of playing football is felt most acutely by parents. But not far behind are the administrators at Football Australia. The 2020 report ""Eleven Principles for the Future of Australian Football"" found cost was seen as a barrier to entry, and high elite fees may be caused by a range of factors including payments to senior players at clubs, and duplication and inefficiencies across the layered administration of the game. It estimated two thirds of registration fees remain with clubs, and are not channelled up the football pyramid. Yabio has found anecdotally that while some Victorian clubs charge up to $2,500 for kids as young as six to be part of elite training programs, talented AFL prospects at an equivalent development level pay roughly $600. Those figures are supported by Football Australia's research, which finds community football can generally cost up to $800 per season, and elite NPL programs go above that — although they may offer a 40-week calendar and training up to four nights per week. The Eleven Principles report recommended an objective assessment on the cost of playing football in Australia be carried out, but Football Australia this week wasn't yet in a position to discuss when that might be released. The governing body is pushing along with other reforms in the meantime. It has established a club licensing scheme to improve governance at the higher levels of the game. It's also pushing ahead with a plan to remove domestic transfer fee caps, which promises to provide additional revenue for state league clubs who most heavily rely on registration fees. But the players' union feels Football Australia's tinkering with the transfer system is too hasty, given it's likely to create a new barrier for players to move from NPL to A-League Men level. ""If we are going to bring in reforms, the onus is on individuals and the entire game, to do the work, to do the modelling, to understand the impact that it's going to have,"" said Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) co-CEO Beau Busch. ""The sport doesn't have the opportunity to make error at the moment, we need to get more decisions right than we get wrong, and a pre-condition of doing that is doing the policy work."" The PFA argues it's unjustified to provide a new revenue stream for clubs, when it's parents who have been paying for their children's junior development costs. And it feels uncomfortable no such tweak is being brought in for the women's game. The reforms are also ignoring what Busch believes is the biggest impediment for both player development and growth of the game: the cost of playing. ""The game can't thrive if people can't access it,"" Busch said, describing affordable football as ""foundational"". ""If we can't ensure that's the case, then the sport will be poorer for it and we won't be able to not only have thriving national teams and be able to compete internationally, we won't have have people who can fall deeply in love with it and connect the sport if they can't even access it."" Bayew is one of a handful of players emerging in the A-League with links to Football Empowerment, including Western United clubmate Ajak Deu. Yabio's organisation assists players who don't secure a highly coveted, fully subsidised A-League academy place. It provide them with free training, off-field workshops and trial match opportunities against A-League academy sides. In one of those matches in December 2019, Bayew impressed against an Adelaide United junior team that included boom youngster Mohamed Toure. ""We've known Adisu since since he was 15 years old, he was a very talented kid, but with limited opportunities [to showcase himself] for the A-League sides,"" Yabio said. ""Against Adelaide United [in 2019] he showed he could match it with them."" Bayew played junior football at local club Caroline Springs George Cross. Yabio recalled Bayew was part of Football Empowerment as the teenager graduated from the junior grades at NPL club Green Gully. He earned a scholarship and promotion to the seniors in 2018 before he signed with Western United in 2020. But while he's proud of the success of Bayew and others, out on the fields of St Albans in Western Melbourne, Yabio knows there's only so much his organisation can do. He'd like to see more subsidised opportunities for promising players who can't afford to be part of the costly academy system. ""Implementing a scholarship within clubs, I know there are some great clubs that do it, having a best practice among clubs... that would work well. ""Otherwise, we could be missing out on the next Socceroo, because of the fee barrier."" Adisu Bayew injured his calf earlier this month and will miss tonight's A-League Men's semifinal first leg between Western United and Melbourne Victory.

92,"Australia has a genuine contender at this year's Giro d'Italia, and he's sitting just 20 seconds off the pace",sport," Sport Jai Hindley caps impressive opening week at Giro d'Italia, although Caleb Ewan still hunts for stage wins We're nine stages into this year's Giro d'Italia and, in Jai Hindley, Australia has a rider within striking distance of the overall race lead. Hindley currently sits in fifth place, 20 seconds behind overall leader Juan Pedro López Pérez. However, if you exclude Pérez, who is unlikely to stick with the climbers as the Giro progresses, Hindley is in an even stronger position, just eight seconds adrift of João Almeida, six back from Romain Bardet and five behind Richard Carapaz. This was just the second of seven mountainous stages on the program at this year's race, so it's important not to get carried away with things, but the early form looks promising for the 26-year-old West Australian. The most pleasing sign moving forward was the way he mixed it with the leaders on the most significant test of the Giro to date, Sunday's 191km-long, mountainous ninth stage — not that it was easy. ""I didn't really expect to take the win today,"" an exhausted Hindley said post-race. ""I was on the edge all the way up the mountain, trying to survive as best I could. ""I rode my own pace, and suffered pretty badly in the end. ""In the last kilometre everything came together and I knew about the right turn before the finish so I went through there first and just gave it my all until the finish."" The brutal stage, which culminated at the top of the fearsome Blockhaus climb, 200km east of Rome in Italy's Apennine region, was a significant moving day for the leading contenders at this year's race. Team Ineos Grenadiers clearly marked the stage as one where significant gains could be made, with the notorious train of riders clad in red and black setting a terrific pace at the front of the group, obliterating the peloton on the lower slopes of the climb. Hindley's fellow Aussie Richie Porte drove what remained of the lead group further into the red zone as the road ramped up, shedding all but six of the best — one of whom was his fellow countryman, Hindley. Despite being distanced initially by some tremendous surges from pre-race favourites Carapaz, Romain Bardet and Mikel Landa, Hindley held onto his form enough to regain contact and eventually, somehow had enough gas to out-last an elite group of riders to cross the line first to claim his second career Giro stage win. Bora-Hansgrohe sporting director Enrico Gasparotto described Hindley's performance as incredibly good post-race. ""He was always up there when the race exploded on the last part of the climb. He rode his own pace and was able to re-join the three leaders when they tried to shake him off,"" he said. The victory puts Hindley in a strong position to once again challenge for a podium, just as he did in his breakout 2020 performance, finishing second overall. With last year a write off for Hindley due to injury and illness — he abandoned the Giro with a saddle sore after 14 stages — this win and return to form will have the Australian once again dreaming of pink. ""We [Team Bora-Hansgrohe] came here with three leaders and big ambitions,"" Hindley said, referring to Emmanuel Buchmann and Wilco Kelderman. ""You shouldn't write anyone off at this point."" Buchmann sits 49 seconds behind Hindley, with Kelderman close to 11 minutes off the pace, meaning Hindley is likely to be protected as leader heading into the second week of the race — where the parcours suggests the status quo will be maintained for general classification — and the decisive third week. While Hindley has enjoyed a stage win, Caleb Ewan is still waiting to get the monkey off his back in this year's race. Ewan's first-stage crash meant that his Giro got off to the worst possible start and although he recovered and missed out on stage six by the narrowest of margins, he is yet to stand atop the podium while his key rivals, Mark Cavendish and Arnaud Démare — twice, both have. After enduring what he described as a ""sprinters nightmare"" on stage nine, Ewan likely has a handful more chances before the race reaches the Alps in the third week. That will come on Wednesday's 11th stage, a flat 203km ride from Santarcangelo di Romagna on the east coast, north to the central city of Reggio Emlia — although Tuesday's 196km roll along the Adriatic Coast from Pescara to Jesi might suit a sprinter like Ewan, should his team keep him in contention during the lumpy second half of the route. Thursday's route has three classified climbs, but a flat final 20km, which might also suit any sprinters capable of getting over those hills — including Ewan — while Friday's short-ish 150km run to Cuneo also looks promising. After that though, the roads get lumpier and the likelihood of Ewan bailing to focus on the Tour de France gets higher. Caleb Ewan will be hoping to add to his five Giro d'Italia stage wins when the year's first grand tour kicks off on Friday, but will face a daunting opponent in the sprints as Mark Cavendish makes his first Giro start in nine years. Ewan currently sits in ninth spot in the sprinters points competition, the Maglia Ciclamino, a whopping 105 points behind Demare. The Lotto-Soudal rider has not finished a Giro in four previous attempts and, with the points jersey all but out of his reach, you'd expect him to forgo the high Alps in order to better prepare for the Tour de France. Former lead out man for Cavendish, Mark Renshaw, said on SBS's coverage of the sixth stage that if Ewan didn't win then he would not win a stage at this year's race. That prediction might be tested this week, but you sense it will still be his final chance of glory at the first Grand Tour of the 2022 season.

The Bulldogs' most recent win came in round eight with a 16-12 victory over the Roosters. The victory followed an unorthodox intervention by the club's general manager of football, Phil Gould, to take over Bulldogs training. The move raised further questions about Barrett's future — he denied claims he was being undermined by Phil Gould at Canterbury, declaring the Bulldogs players ""know who the coach is"". His resignation followed a 16-6 loss to Newcastle at Lang Park during the Magic Round, when the Knights ended a seven-game losing streak. Barrett's departure comes despite an expensive recruitment drive that has included the additions of Josh Addo-Carr, Matt Burton, Tevita Pangai, Matt Dufty and Paul Vaughan. It's unclear who will be in the coach's seat for Friday's match against Wests Tigers, but assistant coach David Furner or NSW Cup coach Michael Potter loom as the most likely candidates to take over in the short term. Longer term options are thought to be headed by premiership-winning duo Paul Green and Shane Flanagan, whose son Kyle is on the Bulldogs' books. Others drawing speculation as potential candidates include St Helens coach Kristian Woolf and Cameron Ciraldo, who is an assistant at Penrith, as Barrett was before joining the Bulldogs.

94,Sam Kerr inspires Chelsea Women's FA Cup win in front of record crowd at Wembley,sport," Sport Sam Kerr scores twice as Chelsea beat Manchester City 3-2 in Women's FA Cup final to win domestic double Sam Kerr has scored two goals at Wembley to win Chelsea the Women's FA Cup, repeating her success in the 2021 final when she also struck twice. (Sam Kerr 33, 99; Erin Cuthbert 63) (Lauren Hemp 42, Hayley Raso 89) Wembley Stadium - Crowd 49.094 The Matildas captain seized on an error by Australian teammate Alanna Kennedy for the winner in Chelsea's 3-2 victory over Manchester City on Sunday, sealing victory after another compatriot, Hayley Raso, had scored for City to force extra time. The match was watched by 49,094, a new record for a Women's FA Cup final. Kerr opened the scoring after 33 minutes, scoring for the fourth successive domestic final. City levelled through England's Lauren Hemp before the break, but a stunning 62nd-minute goal from Scottish international Erin Cuthbert restored Chelsea's lead. With 15 minutes left, City brought Raso off the bench and she scored a superb 88th-minute equaliser. Nine minutes into extra time Kennedy tried and failed to cut out a clearance allowing Kerr to race clear from the halfway line. Her shot, aided by a heavy deflection off Alex Greenwood, proved decisive. It was cruel on Kennedy, who had been otherwise outstanding. ""The (league and Cup) double, it's amazing,"" said Kerr, who had also scored two brilliant goals against Manchester United seven days earlier to seal the Women's Super League title for Chelsea. The Chelsea and Matildas striker could create even more history at tonight's FA Cup final. ""It's an amazing feeling to be part of this club — it's the best club in the world and I'm just so proud. It's been an incredible ride."" Kerr, who also scored in the last two League Cup finals, now has eight goals in four English club finals. The WSL golden boot winner's first was a poacher's goal. England defender Millie Bright found herself on the right wing and sent in a wayward cross that goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck appeared to misjudge. Kerr, however, had read the flight perfectly and arrived at the far post a matter of inches from the goal line to head the ball in. City were hauled back into the game eight minutes later by England's rising star Hemp. The winger stood up Bright before cutting inside and curling a shot inside the far post. Cuthbert restored Chelsea's lead, cracking in a shot from 20 yards that went off the crossbar. Raso's introduction revived City and she levelled when she took a long pass from Greenwood on her chest, held off Chelsea skipper Magda Eriksson, and converted superbly. But as so often, Kerr had the final word.

95,'A leader without a title': Buchanan pays tribute to Symonds as cricket greats share their grief,sport," Sport John Buchanan pays tribute to Andrew Symonds as cricket greats share outpouring of grief Teammates, rivals and fans have shared an outpouring of grief and love for Andrew Symonds after the cricket champion died in car accident near Townsville on Saturday night. Former Australian coach John Buchanan told ABC News Breakfast Symonds was a close friend whose ability to bounce back from mistakes was one of his most endearing features. ""(He was) somebody that I always admired in terms of the way that he went about his cricket, but also the principles that he held dear to him,"" Buchanan said. ""And at 46, it's certainly way too early for someone like that to depart our world."" Buchanan held a long relationship with Symonds, having overseen his emergence in Queensland state teams before guiding him through his introduction to Test cricket. ""Whenever I think of Roy, I see a young guy full of life, always wanting to please, always wanting to entertain, a big wad of white zinc across his lip, a big floppy hat a lot of times, later in his career, the dreadlocks,"" Buchanan said. ""But also a person of incredible athleticism, a person who could do things on the cricket field that very few could do. A person that really grew into his cricketing life. ""He was always an incredible talent, from the time that he stepped straight onto the field in Gloucestershire as a 19 -year-old. But his true home was Australia, and that's where he wanted to be. And we first saw that talent when he played against England in Toowoomba in 1994."" Buchanan said Symonds was a leader of the team, even if not in an official respect. ""Roy was never perfect, that was for sure, and he never admitted that he was,"" he said. ""You know, he made poor decisions, like all of us do, at different stages of his life and different stages in his cricket career. ""But the one thing about Roy — and one of the things that I think endeared him to most people — was that even though he made a mistake, he would openly admit that and try to rectify that and take full accountability for that. ""And so when he saw other people that were probably treading the same path, he was certainly one of the first people to come forward and try to put them on the right direction. ""You know, I always saw him as a leader in our team without a title. He was a person that had strong leadership values but certainly didn't wear the stripes of the leader, but demonstrated how the game should be played, and how people should conduct themselves."" Former teammates and rivals alike paid tribute to Symonds once the news of his death was made public. ""If Roy shook your hand, you had his word. That's the sort of bloke he was and that's why I always wanted him on my team,"" former Australia test captain Ricky Ponting said. ""An extraordinary player and even better human being. Can't believe he's gone. Thoughts are with his family at this time."" West Indian great Brian Lara said he and Symonds had recently spent time together at Shane Warne's memorial, and had sent text messages to each other the day before the crash. ""We were just sipping on a beer celebrating Warnie's life and enjoying each other's company,"" Lara said. ""Our great friendship and respect for each other started the very first minute we met in battle. You were such a competitor doing any and everything for your team. ""You also made friendship so easy, I loved the spontaneous phone calls and messages. You reached out just yesterday 'how are you champ', 'all good Mr Symonds, how things with you'. Though Andrew Symonds longed to live a simple life, his cricket career was never straightforward. But few cricketers of his generation were as widely beloved as the man they called Roy. ""Well all isn't good anymore I will miss you and I'm devastated. ""You were a champion bloke and the cricket world will miss you. We have lost another great human being."" Indian spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who was a teammate of Symonds at Mumbai Indians in 2011, was struggling to process his death. ""Today I have lost my closest man,"" he tweeted. ""You were just not a colleague. My family, my man, My Symonds uncle. I will miss you terribly."" Indian great Sachin Tendulkar tweeted: ""Andrew Symonds' demise is shocking news for all of us to absorb. ""Not only was he a brilliant all-rounder, but also a live-wire on the field. ""I have fond memories of the time we spent together in Mumbai Indians. May his soul rest in peace, condolences to his family & friends."" Symonds's death comes soon after the passing of Australian cricket legends Shane Warne and Rod Marsh. New details have emerged of the crash after Symonds's car left the road and rolled in Hervey Range, about 50km from Townsville. Waylon Townson tried to save Symonds after hearing the crash and rushing to the scene. ""He was stuck in there, so I tried to pull him out,"" Mr Townson told 9News. ""[I] started doing CPR and checked his pulse but I didn't get much response."" Another witness said Symonds was travelling with his two dogs, which reportedly did not want to leave his side after the crash. ""One of them was very sensitive and didn't want to leave him,"" she said. ""It would just growl at you every time we tried to move him or go near him.""

96,"Djokovic, Świątek win Rome titles to hit high gear ahead of French Open",sport," Sport Novak Djokovic beats Stefanos Tsitsipas, Iga Świątek defeats Ons Jabeur to win Italian Open titles That loss to Carlos Alcaraz seems to have motivated Novak Djokovic to step up his game. Just in time, too. Men's singles Novak Djokovic (#1, SRB) def Stefanos Tsitsipas (#4, GRE) 6-0, 7-6 (7/5) Women's singles Iga Świątek (#1, POL) def Ons Jabeur (#9, TUN) 6-2, 6-2 (French Open starts May 22) A week after his defeat to the 19-year-old Alcaraz in Madrid, Djokovic won the Italian Open without dropping a set on Sunday for his first title of the year. Having missed a large portion of the season because he wasn't vaccinated against the coronavirus, the top-ranked Djokovic beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-0, 7-6 (5) for his sixth Rome title. Now, both Djokovic and Alcaraz need to be considered top favourites for the French Open, which starts next Sunday. ""I go there with the highest ambitions,"" Djokovic said. ""I really like my chances … The way I've been feeling on the court and off the court in the last few weeks, I really think I can go far."" The status of Rafael Nadal, who has won 13 of his record 21 Grand Slam titles at Roland Garros, remains uncertain after the Spaniard's Italian Open ended earlier than expected when his chronically injured left foot began bothering him again. ""Right now, Carlos Alcaraz or Novak Djokovic,"" Tsitsipas said when asked to pick the French Open favourite — without even mentioning Nadal's name. As for the women, the overwhelming favourite is Iga Świątek, the top-ranked player from Poland who defended the women's title in Rome by overwhelming Ons Jabeur 6-2, 6-2 to extend her winning streak to 28 matches. Świątek was a surprise champion at the French Open in 2020 when she was ranked number 54. Now the 20-year-old Polish player goes to Paris on a completely new level. ""I already know that I did some great stuff this season, so I feel like I can just play freely,"" Świątek said. ""For sure the expectations around are higher, but I never had a problem to cut it off and not to think about it. Also, I'm gaining experience at that."" Świątek has won five straight titles during her run. ""All these tournaments that I've won seem pretty surreal right now,"" she said. The hype is growing over Spanish teenage sensation Carlos Alcaraz, who backs up his win over Rafael Nadal on the red clay in Madrid with a three-set victory over Novak Djokovic to reach the final. Djokovic lost a deciding-set tiebreaker to Alcaraz in the Madrid Open semi-finals last weekend. ""That was a close, close match,"" Djokovic said. ""He deserved to win, but it was really one point that decided the winner. I was satisfied with the level that I was playing."" Djokovic's experience — he has won 20 Slams — might give him the edge on the favourites list for Paris. Especially since Alcaraz has never been past the quarterfinals of a major. ""Roland Garros is a marathon grand slam,"" Tsitsipas said. ""Every grand slam is a marathon grand slam, but specifically Roland Garros. It really takes the most out of you spiritually and physically when you're out on the court. Clay-court (tennis) has this ability to really squeeze every single part of you."" Djokovic, who was deported because of his unvaccinated status ahead of the Australian Open, hadn't won a tournament since raising the Paris Masters trophy in November. Djokovic said the ordeal in Australia was ""as much as I've felt pressure in my life and my career, that was something really on a whole different level."" It was Djokovic's 12th final at the Foro Italico. ""This court has always been very, very special,"" he said. ""It's given me joy when I really needed positive sensations. Whenever my form was a bit down I've found energy in this city."" Świątek kept her composure when she saved four break points at a crucial point late in the second set, sliding in to reach a drop shot then responding with a splendid backhand volley drop winner on the final break point after a 19-shot rally. ""I kind of shifted my attitude from, 'Whoa, she's going to spread me around now,' to, 'I'm going to get to every ball now and play every point till the last shot'."" Jabeur was on a streak of her own with 11 consecutive wins entering the final after her Madrid Open title last week but the Tunisian's crafty game of drop shots and spins proved no match for Świątek's movement and accurate groundstrokes. ""Iga is the number one for a reason,"" Jabeur said. ""She's really the leader here on tour. I personally have a lot to learn from her."" The last player to win more consecutive matches was Justine Henin, who won 32 straight over 2007 and 2008. The all-time longest streak belongs to Martina Navratilova, who had a run of 74 in 1984.

97,"Governments, sponsors and players are on board with the NRL Magic Round, but there's room to improve",sport," Sport The Magic Round is a marketing exercise for the NRL, but is it really different to any other round? What is Magic Round good for? The idea of a festival of footy is great for some. Fans love it, at least the locals keen to go to the games in Brisbane or those who have enough money to fly into town to do so. The Queensland government? For sure. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has said it's evidence of ""Queensland's ability to host world-class sporting events"", but it's hard to imagine the International Olympic Committee looked too deeply at the event when making the tough choice between Brisbane and no other bidders for the 2032 Olympic hosting rights. She said it was the biggest thing to happen to rugby league in Queensland since the Maroons won eight straight State of Origin series — a quick reminder that the 2015 Broncos-Cowboys grand final fell in the window since then. The Queensland Premier has also made no secret of her joy in seeing hotel rooms booked out across the city. It's a money-spinning tourism boon, and no-one's pretending it's not. Local casinos and bars are happy to jump on board with ""Magic Weekend"" offers and the like, which goes some way to explaining why the state government was so keen to keep the event in Brisbane; even going so far as to claim it invented the idea that has been a regular fixture of the Super League season in Europe for a decade. The activities out the front of the stadium — ""brought to you by the beer from up here"" — and the various corners of the ground — from Chemist Warehouse, Bundy rum, Ampol — betray the cynical marketing nature of the whole venture, beloved by the state stakeholders and the league itself. So too the many players who for years have said Lang Park is their favourite ground must relish getting an extra chance to run around in the impressively steep cauldron. On a night when four NRL teams took to the park, the Brisbane Broncos looked the best of the bunch. After the last two years, if that's not enough to make you believe in magic, nothing is. Victorious Cowboys captain Chad Townsend said after the final game of the round how much he loved the concept and said the buzz around the city was palpable — a sentiment echoed by other players over the weekend. But it's perhaps enjoyed less by the Brisbanites whose weekends were waylaid by about two dozen hours of major road closures over those three days. And the tired stadium workers heard lamenting three long days of service to well-lubricated patrons. Of course, along with that amount of alcohol came fan violence on the first night, largely cheered on by those in the north-eastern quarter of the stadium, most of whom hopefully couldn't see just how serious it was. The NRL did not feel the need to release a statement condemning the well-publicised behaviour of its fans — a silence that Football Australia or even the AFL would likely not get away with — although NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo did provide comment to News Corp, saying the fans would be banned for life. That's the sort of thing it might be good to broadcast more widely, even if it takes some of the sheen of the ""Magic"". There was at least one pitch invader and while flashing the kiss cam onto two men shouldn't be an issue, perhaps given the derisive laughter it repeatedly elicited from the crowd, those in charge of stadium operations could stop encouraging it. In fact, given how many people, including a few kids, were broadcast on the big screen pretending to give oral sex — footage that was then aggregated across fan pages on social media — maybe it's time to put the fan cam down for a spell altogether. On the field, the football itself was pretty standard fare, because no amount of use of the word ""magic"" in promotional material can transform a bad team into a good team. We certainly saw that with the interesting choice to open the extravaganza with a cellar-swelling showdown between Newcastle and Canterbury. After that, Brisbane continued their resurgence, the Warriors fought back from a seemingly impossible deficit but ultimately fell short, and the Panthers remained dominant. Pretty typical stuff. While three successive days with crowds of 40,000-plus probably couldn't be achieved any other way for the NRL, the long days of Magic Round meant the stadium was never entirely full. The Broncos-Manly match on Friday night, Storm-Panthers match on Saturday Night, and Rooster-Eels match on Sunday evening probably had the biggest crowds of the weekend, with 130,122 fans making it through the gates at various times over the three days. ""Magic Round"" is the ultimate in marketing terms that say a little while meaning less. The NRL trotted out another this year with its ""Unreal"" campaign for the season, although it hasn't caught on the same way ""Magic"" has. Perhaps it's because it's a fun word to say (hell, it's on this page at least 10 times), or maybe it's just easy to take the mickey out of. Either way, with governments, sponsors and players well and truly on board, it's not going anywhere. But that doesn't mean it can't get better. Here's hoping 2023 showcases more of the best on the park and less of the worst of it.

98,AFL Round-Up: Leon's Giants farewell falls flat as Saints catch the eye,sport," Sport AFL Round-Up: Leon Cameron's GWS swansong falls flat, St Kilda makes a statement against Geelong A Giant of the coaching game is farewelled in somewhat disappointing fashion, while the Saints seize their moment and steal the spotlight. Welcome to the AFL Round-Up, where we digest the week that was. The farewell game for a coach is always a weird one. To have earned one, it means that what the coach has done in the previous years has been worthy of merit, but whatever he is doing now is not much chop. More often than not, it inspires one last lift from the same players who have been letting him down. For 16 horrible minutes on Sunday, it didn't even look like Leon Cameron would get that from his GWS. Thankfully, the Giants rallied to save face, but the damage was done in that flat opening stanza. There will be regret among GWS players that such a poor start meant they were unable to properly see their coach off. Cameron deserves to be remembered fondly for his work at GWS. Much of the talk last week was about the team's run to the 2019 grand final, but 2016 was the real chance. Had the Giants scraped past the Bulldogs in that outrageous preliminary final, they would have been hot favourites to beat Sydney — the same team they had beaten in their first final two weeks earlier — in the big one. That team was good enough that dynasties were predicted before a grand final had even been reached. Whenever the next great Giants team arrives, it will owe a debt of gratitude to everything Leon Cameron built. If you squinted, it could have been 2009 again. St Kilda and Geelong under the Docklands roof, flinging the footy from end to end in the match of the round. On paper, the Saints were coming into this game off a 38-point loss to Melbourne and Geelong were off a 53-point win over GWS, but anyone who watched those matches knew that form line was misleading. St Kilda showed something against the Demons, enough to suggest they could seriously challenge any team made up of mere mortals. It took a while for them to warm up to that level, but once the Saints hit top gear, Geelong couldn't keep up. Quite literally. The defining image of the second half was of multiple Saints jerseys streaming away from multiple Cats ones. The pace was too much, the effort above where Geelong were capable of going. The discrepancy between the teams on the day was personified by Paddy Ryder, who produced a performance so dominant that you can already see it being used to justify Geelong's inevitable trade period move for Todd Goldstein. The Cats are what they are, and in an even season still can not be discounted for a top-four finish. But St Kilda's story is far more intriguing. The glimpses we have seen of their in 2022 are becoming more frequent, and even more devastating. What a wonderful day for Stuart Dew and his Suns. As we have banged on about in the Round-Up this year, Gold Coast are much closer than people might realise. As for Freo, this changes nothing — a bad day, a tough trip, a lesson learned. Moneyball reference alert: You know the scene where Brad Pitt tells fake David Justice the Yankees are paying him $3.5 million a year to play against them? That's Adam Treloar and Collingwood right now. And the Dogs are laughing all the way to the bank. For a hot second, Brisbane looked in real trouble against Adelaide on Saturday night. Then Lachie Neale decided he would quite like to win the game, and he made it so. What Lachie says, goes. Who could have seen Essendon's immediate reversion to poor form coming? Most people, probably. The balance is off at the Bombers, the good buried so deep beneath timidity and a lack of true commitment. The Hawks look every bit like a young team still a long way from where they will one day be. Their best isn't yet sustainable, but it's good enough to give an ever-improving Richmond a proper game. North Melbourne have been at the ""can't question the endeavour"" stage for too long now. The Roos crack in. But they do not have the skill or system to win games of football. Something has to give in that space between now and round 23. Melbourne beat West Coast by a lot, and that's about all there is to say about that one. Sixteen wins a row is quite something, and with North Melbourne next week, 17 looks a near certainty. Here we take stock of who is leading the race for the season's individual awards. It was a low-key round for the Rising Star hopefuls, so Nic Martin maintains his lead almost by default. It looked like Sydney put specific effort into stopping Martin on Saturday night, so his young career might be approaching some new challenges in coming weeks. We're giving Aaron Naughton the honours for this week's best mark, with Cameron Zurhaar's grab from last week still the frontrunner for MOTY. And Dustin Martin pips Dayne Zorko for goal of the week, with an effort that needed several replays to be fully comprehended. Ed Langdon remains on top of our GOTY rankings though.

99,"Magpies, Swifts triumph as Super Netball finals race heats up",sport," Sport Collingwood Magpies defeat Queensland Firebirds 71-67, NSW Swifts down Adelaide Thunderbirds 54-40 The Collingwood Magpies have dished out a 71-67 defeat to the Queensland Firebirds in Hobart, as the race for Super Netball finals berths heats up. In Sunday's later game, the NSW Swifts kept their play-offs hopes alive in a 54-40 win over the Adelaide Thunderbirds at Sydney's Ken Rosewall Arena. The Firebirds stay in third place on the ladder, but they are one of four teams — including the Magpies and Swifts — on 16 points. Firebirds star Gretel Bueta fought back in the second half of her 100th national league game but it was not enough to prevent the Magpies seizing a major scalp and joining the Queenslanders in finals contention on four wins from 10 matches. The sixth-placed Magpies almost squandered a 14-goal second-half advantage when the Firebirds chased hard in the closing minutes. After being dominated early by Jodi-Ann Ward, Bueta found her range and benefited from some brave and accurate feeds from her mid-court. The great escape was on target when they trailed by just two, but a desperate possession gain from Magpies centre Molly Jovic helped her team steady. Ward laid the platform with her pressure on Bueta, Shimona Nelson shot 65 goals from 66 attempts and Kelsey Browne (34 feeds) was too quick and decisive for the Firebirds. Bueta eventually wriggled free from Ward's grasp to shoot 20 goals and two super shots for the game. Sarah Klau planted a marker for Commonwealth Games selection with a match-winning performance in the Swifts' victory over the Thunderbirds. Klau has served as an understudy to Diamonds goalkeeper Courtney Bruce for the past few years. Bruce will now be looking over her shoulder at the former South Australian, who stood over Thunderbirds shooters Lenize Potgieter and Tippah Dwan. That she managed seven intercepts and seven deflections while only conceding five penalties would have commanded attention from Diamonds coach Stacey Marinkovich. Swifts co-captain Maddy Proud had another mighty performance at centre, while teenager Sophie Fawns (17 points) was a livewire off the bench in support of Helen Housby (29 goals, one super shot). Centre Tayla Williams enjoyed her best game for the Thunderbirds, who were too wasteful with the ball to be a genuine threat.

The world number two-ranked Hockeyroos entered Sunday's fourth and final match in the box seat after posting a win and two draws earlier in the series. But the series was on edge after Black Sticks captain Megan Hull scored against the run of play in the 14th minute on Sunday. Goals from Rebecca Greiner and Brooke Peris lifted the Hockeyroos to a 2-1 win, ensuring the Australian women's hockey team came up trumps in their first international series since last year's Tokyo Olympics. Edwina Bone, Emily Chalker, Ashlee Wells, Rachael Lynch, and Kate Jenner all retired following the Hockeryoos' shock quarter-final loss to India in Tokyo. Hockeyroos coach Katrina Powell selected 11 players with 17 caps or less for the series against New Zealand. The Hockeyroos' intent to wrap the series up was clear from the outset on Sunday. Hannah Cullum-Sanders narrowly missed getting on the end of a searching Shanea Tonkin pass from close range, and the Hockeyroos had four penalty corners inside the opening four minutes. Hull's goal threw the contest wide open as New Zealand eyed an upset, but the Hockeyroos managed to equalise in the 23rd minute courtesy of some strong build-up play. Courtney Schonell, making her first appearance in the series, did well to hold the ball up in the circle before sending it across to a dangerous spot for Greiner, who managed to get a crucial touch that saw the ball trickle underneath goalkeeper Brooke Roberts and over the goal line. Then four minutes into the third quarter the Hockeyroos were in front when a sublime Steph Kershaw pass found Peris at full pace and behind the Black Sticks defence. With just substitute goalkeeper Grace O'Hanlon to beat in goal, Peris converted the chance with aplomb, knocking her shot on the reverse superbly over the encroaching keeper to score her third goal of the series. The series win will give the Hockeyroos a confidence boost ahead of the Women's World Cup and the Commonwealth Games.

101,Former Manchester United star appointed Macarthur FC ALM coach,sport," Sport Former Manchester United star Dwight Yorke appointed Macarthur FC A-League Men coach Former Manchester United forward Dwight Yorke has been confirmed as the new head coach of A-League Men's (ALM) club Macarthur FC. Yorke has signed a deal to lead the Bulls for the next two ALM seasons in what will be the ex-Trinidad and Tobago international's first senior coaching role. He will replace Ante Milicic, who has stepped down after two seasons as the Bulls' foundation coach to move to Croatia for family reasons. Yorke is no stranger to Australian football, having been Sydney FC's marquee player in the inaugural ALM season in 2005/06, as the Sky Blues went on to win the first championship. ""Having played in the inaugural A-League Men's season I have continually followed the competition and am aware of both the footballing and fan demands in Australia,"" Yorke said in a statement. ""I look forward to adding a positive contribution and improve the game at all levels, however, of course my primary focus will be with the Bulls, to deliver them success and a style of football that defined me as a player.""

102,"Cowboys too strong for Tigers in Magic Round finale as Roosters, Raiders enjoy wins",sport," Sport North Queensland Cowboys defeat Wests Tigers 36-12 in NRL Magic Round finale as Sydney Roosters and Canberra Raiders enjoy wins A try-scoring double and a magnificent assist from North Queensland winger Murray Taulagi has helped the Cowboys claim a 36-12 win over the Wests Tigers. Earlier on the final day of Magic Round in Brisbane, the Sydney Roosters prevailed against Parramatta to win 31-24, while Canberra scored an upset 30-10 triumph over Cronulla. In front of 43,401 spectators at Lang Park, Taulagi was the star turn as he scored a try either side of half-time break and set up Scott Drinkwater for a dazzling opening four-pointer. The Tigers were up against it from the start and it did not help that Michael Maguire's team lost five-eighth Luke Brooks (hamstring), hooker Jake Simpkin (concussion) and prop Zane Musgrove (pectoral). The win consolidates third spot for the Cowboys and they will host Melbourne next Saturday night in Townsville with every belief they can trouble the Storm. In a sign of how far the Cowboys have come in the past year under Todd Payten, Sunday's win was their seventh of the season, the same amount of matches they won in 2021. They got off to a flying start when Taulagi was hassled into touch by Jackson Hastings at the corner post. But in a breathtaking moment, the Cowboys winger instinctively lifted his feet and threw a speculative no-look offload back in field as he fell, with Drinkwater on hand to claim the try. Tigers debutant Junior Tupou and Luke Garner responded, before Taulagi finished a well-worked backline move with a one-handed put-down. From there it was all downhill for the Tigers. Simpkin went off after getting trampled trying to make a tackle, and in the five-minute window before half-time the Cowboys got on the front foot. Kyle Feldt strolled over untouched and Reuben Cotter went steaming up the middle, selling Tigers fullback Starford To'a with a dummy before touching down under the posts. To make matters worse for the Tigers, Brooks pulled out of the second half with a hamstring problem and Musgrove went off with 20 minutes to go to leave Maguire with just 14 fit players. The pressure eventually began to tell when Taulagi added his second try, diving on a Chad Townsend grubber to the in-goal. Peta Hiku crashed over with 20 minutes to play, before Jeremiah Nanai further hammered home the Cowboys' advantage with an acrobatic catch to wrap up the match. The Roosters defied a Mitchell Moses-inspired Parramatta fightback, with Joseph Suaalii starring in their win. Victor Radley (ankle) was a casualty of the victory, which came after an inspired Eels comeback led by Moses just when the result looked secure. The Roosters' success ensured both sides finished 10 rounds with 6-4 win-loss records as the fight for a top-four spot intensified. The Eels, who beat ladder leaders Penrith last week, could not convert their mass of possession late in the first half. Sam Walker's field goal and Suaalii's try either side of half-time seemingly killed off the contest, until the Roosters' 19-point margin was cut to seven in just three minutes. Moses put Isaiah Papali'i through a gap for his second try, then produced a magical effort down the right wing to cross in a brilliant solo performance. Ryan Matterson then stepped through four tacklers to score under the posts and make it a one-point match with 20 minutes to play. But Suaalii literally popped up again, flying high to collect an AFL-like mark from Luke Keary's bomb and score his fifth try in three matches. A penalty goal then gave the Roosters a seven-point buffer they clutched tightly through the last five minutes. Earlier, Radley's ankle felt the weight of a tackler, the lock limping off and being scheduled for scans amid fears of a syndesmosis injury that could sideline him for at least a month. His absence was not felt heavily in the first half, with Sam Walker's kicking game at the centre of the Roosters' carve-up. First, a clunky grubber kick fooled Eels fullback Clint Gutherson, with James Tedesco winning the race to the ball. His second was just as potent, collecting his own kick in behind, which exposed their numerical advantage with Tom Opacic in the sin-bin for a professional foul. The Raiders secured their biggest victory of the season and grabbed back-to-back wins for the first time this year. It was an ugly performance from the high-flying Sharks, but the major concern for coach Craig Fitzgibbon will be a concussion sustained by skipper Dale Finucane. Josh Papalii greeted Finucane with a powerful hit and the Sharks number 13 rode the collision, only to be met by Elliot Whitehead's shoulder. Finucane, unsteady on his feet, was in no condition to carry on as referee Liam Kennedy sent Whitehead to the sin-bin. Finucane failed his HIA for the fourth time in the last two seasons and the latest concussion will undoubtedly worry Cronulla. Canberra was at one point reduced to 11 players after Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad and Corey Horsburgh were both sent to the sin-bin either side of the half-time break. The Sharks, who shifted Nicho Hynes to fullback to cover for Will Kennedy's suspension, never got going. They had 60 per cent of possession in the second half but could only score when Canberra were a player down. Hynes played most of his football at fullback for the Melbourne Storm last year but he had a moment to forget when he dropped a Brad Schneider bomb with Papalii crashing over on the next set for the Raiders. The Raiders also capitalised on a series of backline blunders from Cronulla's Sione Katoa. The winger was a target for halfback Matt Frawley's kicking with Sebastian Kris and Corey Harawira-Naera scoring tries on the back of his errors. Canberra lost Nicoll-Klokstad for a professional foul just before half-time but it was not until the 54th minute when Horsburgh was this time in the sin-bin that Katoa opened the scoring for the Sharks. The only other Cronulla try was a crash ball from Royce Hunt in the final minute that Whitehead was off the field. Schneider, who had scored a first-half penalty, bagged a try late on to ensure the Raiders secured a second-straight win. Hudson Young crossed for a breakaway try for the Raiders.

103,"Andrew Symonds brought Australia along for his brilliant, brutal but sadly brief ride",sport," Sport Andrew Symonds dies aged 46: Roy brought us all along for his brilliant, brutal and sadly brief ride The story of Andrew Symonds the cricketer is one of limitless potential, realised briefly but gloriously in a career that seduced Australia and challenged norms. Here was a cricketer from another genre altogether. A front-rower more than an all-rounder, Symonds and his imposing frame dominated games like few ever have, but always with a wink and a beaming smile. Cricket had heard about Andrew Symonds long before any of us ever saw him. But once we did, we fell in love. He batted like a kid playing two age-levels down, bullying bowling attacks with a unique mix of power and grace. He bowled whatever he damn well felt like. Spin one week, medium pace the next. Sometimes with a cap on. Somehow it always worked. He fielded like nobody had before him. The athleticism of Jonty Rhodes and the laser arm of Ricky Ponting all in one. Symonds brought more to the game than most in a career cut short, partly by his own excesses and partly by a system that abandoned him when he most needed support. The great shame now is that the story of Andrew Symonds the man can be spoken about in so many of the same painful terms. At the age of 46, Symonds has died in a single-car crash not far from Townsville in North Queensland. He had so much more to give, to his family predominantly, but to all of us too. His limitless potential was realised all too briefly. Symonds says he knew he was adopted from the time he was old enough to talk. Born June 9, 1975, in Birmingham, Symonds' adoptive parents Ken and Barbara took him in when he was 15 months old. The family moved to Australia soon after, settling down in the rural North Queensland town of Charters Towers. Symonds's British birth would spark debates as his cricket career progressed, but when an England A call up in 1995 forced a decision, there was only ever likely to be one answer. Through his youth and teenage years, the Symonds buzz had spread through Queensland and Australia. There was a kid out of the far north who was special, a blazing bat destined for the baggy green. Symonds made his way through the state underage teams before making a first class debut for Queensland in the 1994-95 season. His reputation as a free-scoring, attacking batter led to an ODI debut for Australia in 1998 against Pakistan in Lahore. Symonds bowled two overs and didn't bat. Such was the tale of Symonds's early international career. His stocks at first class level, both in Australia and in English country cricket, were growing but a breakthrough for his country remained elusive. With form dipping in 2002 and motivation suddenly an issue, there were even brief flirtations with the Brisbane Broncos and a drastic code switch. The 2003 World Cup was era-defining for Australia in so many ways. It was a first major triumph in a decade without the help of Shane Warne. It was the confirmation of Ricky Ponting as the game's most outstanding batter. And it was the coming out party, at long last, for Andrew Symonds. Symonds was a surprise selection in Australia's squad as spots were opened by Warne's drug ban, an injury to Shane Watson and Darren Lehmann's suspension for using a racial slur. By 2003, few had faith Symonds would ever turn his promise into practice. Fortunately, Ponting was not among the doubters. Symonds scored his first international century in Australia's tournament-opening win against Pakistan. The manner with which he flayed Wasim Akram, Shoahib Akhtar and Waqar Younis to all parts of The Wanderers in Johannesburg will forever be vividly etched into the memory of all who watched it. This one innings of 143 not out, coming at a moment of desperate need for his team, was the manifestation of Symonds's lifetime of work. It repaid the faith of all who had joined him in his journey, and proved to the man himself he truly was capable of all he believed he was. Symonds remained a key part of the Australian team that would go on to lift the World Cup. But already talk had turned to his next conquest. In literal terms, Andrew Symonds replaced Steve Waugh in Australia's Test team for the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle, 2004. He made a duck in his first Test innings and 24 in his second, dismissed both times by the wiles of Muttiah Muralitharan. Symonds was dropped for the third Test of that series, and would not don the baggy green for another 18 months. A recall for the summer of 2005/06 brought with it the first glimpse of what Symonds may become as a Test cricketer, with a helter skelter 72 against South Africa at the MCG. That innings proved prophetic. Twelve months later at the same venue, Symonds erupted. A first Test century, 156 to be exact, in a Boxing Day Ashes Test. As the crushing weight came off Symonds's shoulders, it was passed onto Matthew Hayden's forehead as his great Queensland friend leapt into a celebratory embrace. It was one of the defining images of an iconic Australian summer. Cricket would never again be so sweet for Andrew Symonds. The glitz and glamour of professional sport never appealed to Andrew Symonds. His escape was found on a boat or in a river, fishing rod in hand. And after the day's work was done, a beer or two. Drinking had threatened Symonds's career at many junctions, most seriously in 2005 when he turned up for an ODI against Bangladesh in England still drunk from the night before and unable to stand up. Symonds worked hard to keep his drinking under control, and during those fruitful years from 2006 to 2008, he mostly succeeded. The SCG Test of 2008, between Australia and India, was so many things. It remains one of the most spiteful Test matches ever played, and featured one of the most unforgettable climaxes thanks to the finger spin of Michael Clarke. For Andrew Symonds, it was the beginning of the end for his career. Symonds alleged that Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh called him a monkey during that Test. Symonds's claim was corroborated by Australian teammates who were nearby to the incident. The ICC initially handed Harbhajan a three-match ban, only to downgrade that upon appeal from the BCCI. India threatened to boycott the rest of the tour over the allegations, and as Symonds sat at a tribunal alongside Matthew Hayden, Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting, he was wracked by guilt that he had dragged his teammates and friends into the highly-political mess. There would be no suspension for Harbhajan and no boycott from India, just a hollowness inside Symonds that would never be filled. Racism, specifically the term ""monkey"", had followed Symonds for years to that point. And having at last made a stand, Symonds was crushed by the feeling that Australian cricket had let him down. In the coming years, Symonds would admit to his problems with binge drinking. In June 2009, only 15 months after the Harbhajan incident, Symonds was sent home from the T20 World Cup in England due to ""an alcohol-related incident"". Andrew Symonds's international cricket career was over. In 2012, Symonds officially retired after spending a few years on the international T20 circuit, and dedicated himself to his family. In recent years, he has lived in Townsville with his wife Laura and two young children, Chloe and Billy. Together, they lived a simple life as Symonds surrounded himself with the people and places he loved most. His became a familiar voice in Big Bash commentary, and his unassuming and modest analysis stood apart from his contemporaries. He remains beloved by those who follow the game, here and abroad, and will forever. Generations from now, stories of the man they called Roy will be told. Of the time he and Haydos capsized their boat and had to swim to shore. Or those infectious wicket celebrations, heels flicked together with dreadlocks dancing in a way Test cricket had never seen before. And what about the streaker at the Gabba!? Maybe he could have made it as a Bronco after all. The Andrew Symonds story will now forever feel unfinished, but never unfulfilled. This was a life thoroughly lived, its fruits enjoyed by millions.

104,Sweet 16: Demons' winning streak still alive as Eagles are belted in Perth,sport," Sport Melbourne beat West Coast by 74 points to extend winning streak, Gold Coast stun Fremantle Melbourne's new-found love affair with Perth continued as they posted a 74-point AFL win over West Coast at Perth Stadium. The Demons kicked six goals to one in the opening term of Sunday's match to set up the 16.16 (112) to 5.8 (38) victory in front of 27,488 fans. The result marked Melbourne's 16th straight win, with the run including last year's grand final triumph over the Western Bulldogs and the 83-point preliminary final demolition of Geelong, both at Perth Stadium. Perth had previously been a graveyard for the Demons, with Melbourne losing 17 straight matches at Subiaco Oval between 2004-2016. But the defending premiers have now won four straight games in Perth, with their latest win keeping them at the top of the ladder with a perfect 9-0 record. Sunday's result was soured, however, by a hamstring injury to midfielder James Harmes, who limped off in the final quarter. Harmes' replacement Kade Chandler is facing suspension for his pin-the-arms tackle that resulted in Luke Foley's head being slammed to the turf. West Coast forward Liam Ryan is almost certain to be suspended for a bump to the head of Melbourne young gun Jake Bowey. Although Bowey was able to play on, the high nature of the hit and the fact Ryan ran past the ball to deliver the bump will count against him. Ryan was subbed out in the final term with a hamstring injury. Clayton Oliver (28 disposals, seven clearances) and Christian Petracca (28 disposals, two goals) cleaned up in the middle, Andrew Brayshaw (24 possessions) provided plenty of rebound from defence, while Tom McDonald (four goals), Kysaiah Pickett (three), and Bayley Fritsch (three) cashed in up forward. Max Gawn and Luke Jackson dominated in the ruck. Eagles midfielder Tim Kelly battled hard to win 32 disposals and five clearances, but West Coast's on-ball brigade was overwhelmed. The Eagles started the match without 11 of their best 22 players after Josh Kennedy (sore knee) was a late withdrawal, joining the likes of Nic Naitanui, Luke Shuey, Elliot Yeo, Andrew Gaff, Oscar Allen, Dom Sheed, Willie Rioli and Shannon Hurn on the sidelines. The first-quarter stats were ugly and perfectly summed up Melbourne's dominance. The Demons won the inside-50 count (20-4), clearances (14-4), and contested possessions (40-28) on the way to winning the quarter 6.5 (41) to 1.0 (6). West Coast stemmed the bleeding in the second term and restricted Melbourne to just one goal, but the damage had been done. Eagles duo Jamie Cripps and Bailey Williams produced special checkside goals in the third quarter. But West Coast defender Jeremy McGovern was left fuming after suffering through an umpiring howler. McGovern had taken a defensive mark and wanted to take his kick before pointing to Petracca, who had made no effort to leave from the protected zone. Instead of paying a 50m penalty, the umpire called play-on and pinged McGovern for deliberate out of bounds, with Petracca nailing the subsequent goal. West Coast worked hard to keep the margin at 44 points, but the floodgates opened in the final term as the Demons piled on seven goals. Carlton survived a spirited Greater Western Sydney fightback to spoil Leon Cameron's farewell with a 30-point victory at Giants Stadium on Sunday. The Giants were looking to send Cameron off in style in his 193rd and final game as head coach but it was the Blues who looked more inspired as they kicked five goals to one in the last quarter to triumph 15.15 (105) to 11.9 (75). The win came at a cost for the Blues as Zac Williams sustained a nasty lower leg injury and was in tears as he had to be helped from the field. The Giants were expected to come out firing in Cameron's last match in charge but the Blues started brighter and put 4.2 on the scoreboard before GWS even moved the ball into their forward 50. The home team gradually worked their way back into the contest to be level at the main break and only trailed by a goal at the last change. But the Giants were never quite able to claim the lead as the Blues eventually overpowered them to move to a 7-2 record and finish round nine in the top-four. Charlie Curnow kicked two crucial goals early in the final term after being well-held by Giants defender Sam Taylor, while Sam Walsh, Corey Durdin, Jack Silvagni and Zac Fisher also scored two each in an impressive team performance for the Blues. Co-captain Josh Kelly (36 disposals, one goal) looked to inspire the Giants throughout, while Braydon Preuss was also crucial to the comeback in his first match as sole ruckman for the club. Toby Greene, Harry Himmelberg and Jake Riccardi each kicked two goals to keep the Giants in the contest but the Blues were more efficient with the ball and won the inside-50 count 64-47. Carlton had to do without Williams for much of the match after the gun defender was injured moments before quarter-time and had to be subbed out of the game. The former Giant was running toward a marking contest in the Blues' defensive 50 when he fell to ground with no one near him and immediately clutched at his lower leg. While the Giants weren't able to send Cameron off with a victory, both clubs formed a guard of honour for the coach as he walked off the field after the final siren. The Blues have a short turnaround for their Friday night clash with Sydney while the Giants are set to start life under interim coach Mark McVeigh against West Coast at Giants Stadium on Sunday Gold Coast have halted Fremantle's six-game AFL winning run, claiming an impressive 36-point upset win over the Dockers at Carrara Stadium. In wet conditions, the Suns restricted the high-flying Dockers to just four goals as they backed up last weekend's win over Sydney at the SCG with a 10.9 (68) to 4.9 (33) victory on Sunday. The win lifts the Suns to a 4-5 record and to the fringe of the top eight while Fremantle's loss is just their second of the season. Mabior Chol kicked four goals for the Suns, while fellow recruit Levi Casboult had two. The Suns' win was set up by their dominance at ground level, with Izak Rankine failing to kick a goal but having a hand in 11 score involvements. Young guns Noah Anderson (26 disposals) and Matt Rowell (eight tackles) were among the Suns' best while another ex-Richmond player Brandon Ellis (21 disposals, seven marks, four clearances) had one of his best games in a Suns jumper. Co-captains Jarrod Witts (29 hitouts, eight tackles) and Touk Miller (34 disposals, eight tackles, 10 clearances) were also superb for the hosts, including a rare goal for Witts in the first quarter, while ex-Docker Sam Collins was a mountain in defence. Fremantle, playing without Michael Walters (health and safety protocols), Sam Switkowksi (concussion) and Nathan O'Driscoll (foot), had 19 inside-50s and kicked two goals in the first quarter to hold a two-point advantage at the first change. Despite continuing to dominate the inside-50 count, Fremantle didn't score another goal until Sean Darcy's snap in the 21st minute of the fourth quarter. The only real highlight for Justin Longmuir's team was a first AFL goal for Neil Erasmus in the first term, with the Dockers left with plenty to ponder on their trip back to Perth. Fremantle host Collingwood at Optus Stadium next week while the Suns head to Ballarat to face the Western Bulldogs.

105,'I can't put a time on it': West Coast chairman refuses to impose deadline on club's rebuild,sport," Sport West Coast Eagles chairman Russell Gibbs refuses to put time line on rebuilding club West Coast Eagles chairman Russell Gibbs says there is no time frame on the club's rebuild, but some improvement is expected over the next year. The Eagles sit 18th on the AFL ladder after a disastrous start to the season, which has seen the side win just a single game, and lose four consecutive matches by 63 points or more. The club has been hit hard by injury and COVID-related unavailability, but has also endured self-inflicted stumbles, with several players attending a nightclub as COVID-19 numbers in Western Australia rose. Speculation about the future of chief executive Trevor Nisbett and coach Adam Simpson prompted Gibbs to write a letter to supporters in which threw his support behind the pair to lead the club out of its predicament. The Eagles have several young players who are yet to feature at AFL level. Gibbs said until the club was able to establish its list, there would be no time line imposed on the rebuild. ""I don't think it would be fair to say, 'Well, Adam [Simpson], if you don't do this within two years you're gone, or three years.' I just don't think that we're in a position to be doing that,"" he told ABC Radio Perth on Saturday. But he said there would have to be signs of things turning around in the near future. ""We have to see improvement without doubt,"" he said. ""If we go through next year and there is no improvement and there is no sign of improvement, then the coach obviously would have to explain where he sees the club going. ""But I stress again, at this point, there is no time [frame] on that. I'd like to see everyone playing together and we'll go forward from there. ""I can't put a time on it. All I can do is ask people just to continue to support the club as we go through this."" The Eagles have finally acknowledged a rebuild of its playing list is needed and it will use the draft to achieve those ends. But Gibbs refused to be drawn on the future of several veterans. Shannon Hurn, Josh Kennedy, Nic Naitanui and Luke Shuey are out of contract, along with 250-gamer Jack Redden. ""I'm not trying to be cute here, but I'm chairman of the board, not chairman of selectors,"" Gibbs said. ""Those decisions have to be made by the football department, the coach, selectors, given who is available to replace any player that may not be playing for us. It is out of my jurisdiction."" But the rebuild won't revolve solely around players, with the club to investigate its long injury list, which includes several soft-tissue injuries. ""Some of the soft-tissue injuries, perhaps they can be avoided,"" Gibbs said. ""Is it the way that we train, is it the ground that we run on? What is the cause? We can't accept the fact that we are getting those injuries."" Gibbs said Nisbett remained the best person to guide the club through those issues, but conceded the board was working on a succession plan for the longtime chief executive. ""He's taken us through, certainly in the past couple of years, one of the toughest times that's ever hit the AFL,"" he said. ""Now we're hitting a very, very tough time when it comes to on-field. And we believe that Trevor remains, at this point, the person [to guide the club through that]. ""Having said that, I'm not hiding away from the fact that Trevor's succession, like any good organisation, will continue to be looked at.""

106,'Like when your dad comes to watch you play': What it's like to play for Ange Postecoglou,sport,"  Ange Postecoglou just led Celtic to the Scottish title in his first year as coach. So what's it like to play under him? Brisbane Roar great Jack Hingert says playing under Ange Postecoglou is an all-or-nothing kind of affair. ""It was clear right from the start what you had to do. To be honest it was tough,"" he said, describing what it was like to join Postecoglou's thrilling Brisbane Roar side as it romped to three A-League championships. ""But he was very good at that at making you believe in the way of playing. ""When you go out to play for Ange, it's almost like when you're a kid and your dad comes to watch you play — he makes you want to impress him and do well and gain his approval. ""The way he could motivate you, he just had this presence. You wanted to be a part of the whole culture."" Postecoglou has established that legendary culture in no time at all in his latest pressure-cooker role. The Australian manager is the toast of Scotland after leading Celtic to the Scottish title in his first season as manager. After clinching the premiership on Thursday morning away to Dundee United, overnight his Celtic side had a celebratory homecoming, thumping Motherwell 6-0 in front of the club's fans. ""Champions, that's who we are,"" an emotional Postecoglou told delirious Celtic fans after the match. Last season, the club finished a whopping 25 points behind their great rivals, Rangers. ""I just want to thank everyone involved from the board management and the best staff in the land — unbelievable effort,"" he said ""I've got a group of players who have been unbelievable — champions of Scotland and well deserved. And for you, the best [fans] in the planet — unbelievable. ""You've embraced me, my family, this jumper. And I want everyone to enjoy today, enjoy the summer and we'll come back bigger and better — because we never stop."" Postecoglou is so popular in Scotland he says he cannot possibly keep up with the amount of whiskey being sent to his home since letting it slip he is partial to a drop. Another Roar hero from their Postecoglou days said the coach created a similar sense of purpose in Brisbane, almost single-handedly changing the entire trajectory of the club. ""He came to the Roar with a very strong approach, mindset and vision, where he thought Brisbane Roar could create a legacy,"" Matt Smith, a defensive linchpin of the side, said. There were few in the British press who heralded Ange Postecoglou's appointment as Celtic manager. Fast forward a season and those doubters have been left eating their words as the Australian did what he does best. Win. ""The way he spoke about creating something special certainly grabbed my attention. ""He sold his vision and his legacy to the players and everyone around the club, and we bought into it. Smith said the training was often harder than the actual games. ""Day to day, it was very, very intense,"" Smith said. ""You could feel his passion and desire every single day. His style of football was non-negotiable. It was very high risk but very rewarding. ""The environment he created was very powerful."" Postecoglou was a left-field signing for Celtic and his start at the club was rocky. Joining when the famous club was at a low ebb, he took just two wins and a draw from eight matches to sit sixth on the ladder. But Hingert said the key with Postecoglou was to keep the faith and the coach would deliver. Just as he did for Celtic. ""For a long time, he has believed playing in that style,"" Hingert said. ""A lot of people might change, but he stuck to his guns regardless of early results. ""He has always stuck to what he believed in and that made you want to buy into it. ""He made you think that this is the only way to play."" Smith said it was something special to be a part of. ""Ange created a team full of players that were so attuned to each other, it was unbelievable,"" he said. ""He was very firm in ensuring players stuck to their role."" We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Smith sees a lot of similarities between the current Celtic side and the ""Roarcelona"" team Ange created. ""How he transforms clubs is probably the greatest measure of the man,"" he said. ""He reshaped Brisbane Roar, he reshaped the landscape of Australian football. ""It was remarkable based on the situation of the Roar at the time. ""And it's a similar to Celtic, to completely reposition how the team goes about things."" Both Smith and Hingert said they had no doubt Postecoglou would be a success at Celtic, as long as he was given the time to mould the side in his image. ""To be frank, everywhere he's been, he's won,"" Hingert said. ""When he's been given the opportunity he's won. You can't argue with his track record."" And if continues to be successful with Celtic? ""I’d like to see him in the Premier League. I think he can go on to bigger and better things,"" Hingert said. Smith believes big clubs will already be eyeing off the Australian coach, and a Champions League campaign next season will further showcase him to the rest of Europe. ""I would be surprised if Celtic manage to hang on to him,"" he said.

107,'Utterly devastated': Tributes flow after former Test cricketer Andrew Symonds dies in car crash,sport,"  Former Australian cricketer Andrew Symonds killed in car crash Former Australian cricket star Andrew Symonds has died in a single-vehicle car crash in North Queensland, police say. The former Test cricket all-rounder was killed in the accident on Saturday night, outside Townsville, where he lived in retirement. Police said the 46-year-old was driving on Hervey Range Road near Alice River Bridge shortly after 11pm, when his car left the road and rolled. Emergency service workers attempted to revive him but he died at the scene. Townsville Acting Inspector Gavin Oates said the cause of the crash was not known. Though Andrew Symonds longed to live a simple life, his cricket career was never straightforward. But few cricketers of his generation were as widely beloved as the man they called Roy. ""That's still being investigated at this stage. Forensic Crash Unit officers have attended the scene and are conducting the investigation and they will prepare a report for the coroner,"" he said. ""The accident was actually heard by neighbours who are people who live nearby that were the first people on scene and alerted emergency services. ""They provided the assistance they could at the time."" Symonds played 26 Tests for Australia and won two Cricket World Cups, and is the father of two children, Chloe and Billy. ""We are still in shock – I’m just thinking of the two kids,"" Symonds's wife Laura told The Courier-Mail, after flying from Sydney to Townsville on Sunday morning. ""He was such a big person and there is just so much of him in his kids."" Tributes flowed in from the global cricket community throughout the morning, with former teammate and wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist expressing his heartache on Twitter. ""This really hurts,"" he wrote. ""Think of your most loyal, fun, loving friend who would do anything for you. That’s Roy."" Ricky Ponting — who captained Symonds during his Test and ODI careers — also paid tribute to his former teammate on Twitter. ""If Roy shook your hand you had his word, that's the sort of bloke he was and that's why I always wanted him on my team,"" Ponting wrote. ""An extraordinary player and even better human being. Can't believe he's gone."" Former Australian Test captain Mark Taylor said it was ""another tragic day for cricket"", after the recent deaths of Shane Warne, Rod Marsh, and Dean Jones. ""I can't quite believe it. Another tragic day for cricket,"" he said on Channel Nine. ""Everyone had him earmarked as a white-ball player. He wanted to prove to the world he could play test cricket and he did. ""He was just an entertainer. ""He wanted to go out there and have fun."" Former English test captain Michael Vaughan said: ""Simmo … this doesn't feel real."" Former fast bowler and commentator Damien Fleming said: ""This is so devastating. Roy was so much fun to be around. Our thoughts are with Symonds family."" Fellow former fast bowler Jason Gillespie wrote: ""Horrendous news to wake up to. Utterly devastated. We are all gonna miss you mate."" Cricket Australia CEO Nick Hockley also paid tribute to the 'prodigious talent'. ""Andrew was a much-loved and admired cricketer in Australia and around the world,"" Hockley said in a press release. ""He was a prodigious talent from an early age in Queensland with his clean ball-striking ability, shrewd spin bowling and brilliant fielding. ""He will be sadly missed by the Australian cricket community and particularly his very close friends at the Queensland Bulls where he was a popular and much-admired team-mate and friend. ""Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this devastatingly sad time."" Symonds was highly regarded as an explosive batsman and tricky bowler in the short forms of the game, but also became a Test star, averaging more than 40 with the bat after scoring two centuries. Known as a larrikin on and off the field, he was a fan favourite and went down in folklore in 2008 after a run in with a streaker at the Gabba. Symonds had also been on the brink of moving into coaching, with plans to help Warne in The Hundred competition this year, before the legendary spinner's tragic death in March. A moment's silence was held in Symonds's memory before the final game of the NRL's Magic Round, between Wests Tigers and the Nroth Queensland Cowboys, based in his adopted hometown of Townsville. Symonds was a passionate rugby league fan and occasionally participated in training sessions with the Brisbane Broncos. Gold Coast Dolphins Cricket Club president Adam Daniels said the club was ""deeply saddened"" by the tragic death. Symonds had played for the side as a 15-year-old. ""I think there's been a lot of tragedy in cricket this year and Andrew was just a bigger than life character and it's shocking to hear,"" he said. ""He started playing at the club as a 15-year-old … he represents, probably in the history of the club, one of the first players to come through as a junior player to play for Australia."" Daniels said his mate had always given ""200 per cent"" to the game. ""I think he's the ultimate teammate, he would do anything for you – on the field and off the field,"" he said. ""He created an atmosphere in the change room that was fun. ""He was a fun guy to be around, but as a team-mate he would go into battle for you. ""I think he was ultimately one of the most talented players. He could do everything, from a batting point of view, (he bowled) medium pace, he bowled off spin, his athleticism in the field. He was just the ultimate athlete. ""I think that probably what's forgotten is his work ethic. He was probably one of the hardest trainers and I think that's what lead to him being a test cricketer.""

108,"Liverpool victorious in goalless FA Cup, defeating Chelsea in penalties",sport,"  Liverpool wins goalless FA Cup, defeating Chelsea 6-5 in penalties Add the FA Cup to the collection. Jürgen Klopp has now won every major title for Liverpool. A 6-5 victory over Chelsea on penalties in Saturday's final produced Liverpool's first FA Cup triumph since 2006 and kept it in contention for, potentially if unlikely, a quadruple of trophies. Just like in the League Cup final in February, the FA Cup showpiece ended 0-0 through 120 minutes before Liverpool prevailed again. This time, the Reds were helped by Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount's penalty being saved before Konstantinos Tsimikas clinched the shootout win with his first-ever goal for the club. In two weeks, Liverpool will be hoping to collect another trophy by beating Real Madrid in the Champions League final. Before then, Klopp has to hope Manchester City slips up in the final two rounds of the English Premier League and Liverpool takes advantage to regain that trophy. ""That is part of the 'mentality monsters' as well, going to extra time and keeping the high level, performing well,"" Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker said. ""It gives us even more confidence to keep on going for the Premier League and also the Champions League final. This is a fantastic moment and now we just need to enjoy it."" There was only more Wembley pain for Chelsea. Weeks of ownership turmoil for Chelsea are ending with the team becoming the first to lose three consecutive FA Cup final appearances, having been beaten by Arsenal in 2020 and Leicester last year. The final of world football's oldest competition had never gone to penalties before at Wembley. But Liverpool's last FA Cup success in 2006 was in one of the two previous shootouts that settled the cup final that both happened in Cardiff while Wembley was being rebuilt. Saturday's final ended with one half of the stadium shrouded in a red haze of smoke after beginning under a cloud when Liverpool fans jeered the national anthem and the introduction of Prince William. After the ceremony to mark 150 years of the FA Cup, the 141st final was more tense than turgid, just like in the League Cup final in February. There were 58 shots produced by the teams without finding the net over their two games at Wembley in 2022. One chance did come early for Liverpool, with Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy saving from Luis Díaz. Then came Christian Pulisic's shot that crept wide on a frustrating afternoon for the Chelsea forward. The first half was punctuated by injury delays for Liverpool players. Alisson had to be treated after his shin took a knock while blocking Marcos Alonso's shot. The goalkeeper recovered but it was not long before Mohamed Salah went down. The forward could not continue due to a sore groin but he was able to walk off unaided when being replaced by Diogo Jota in the 33rd minute. Liverpool missed the threat of the Premier League's top scorer. Chelsea missed their chances to exploit that. A blistering start to the second half by Chelsea saw Marcos Alonso shoot wide and send a free kick onto the crossbar around Pulisic's effort being repelled by Alisson's diving save. A late flurry of Liverpool attempts could not prevent the game going into extra time, with the post hit by Díaz from a tight angle and Andy Robertson from close range. The only previous goalless showpiece through extra time at Wembley was in 2005 when Arsenal won one of its record 14 titles. Now Liverpool has the eighth FA Cup it has been waiting 16 years to win.

109,'You lose yourself in the euphoria': Athletes with a disability find their place in strength sports,sport," Sport Athletes with a disability like Ainslee Hooper are finding their place in strength sports It's the noise that hits you first. The voices and cheers of the competitors and crowd bounce off the high concrete walls. The crash and clatter of metal on metal as weights are lifted and pushed. The high tempo music that pumps out of speakers perched high above the action. The combination should be jarring, a racket that grates. But, instead, the sound floats out of the open roller door and onto the quiet street like some kind of urban symphony. It's a Saturday morning at Strong Geelong and the Battle in the Bay Strongwoman and Strongman competition is underway. Inside the industrial building that is home to Strong Geelong, Ainslee Hooper, hands chalked and face set in fierce determination, waits for the call. ""Athlete ready?"" comes the shouted question. Ainslee nods. The clock starts and she clenches her hands around the 'log', the cylinder of steel meant to imitate an actual log. The goal is to get as many reps, or lifts, of the log in 60 seconds. To count as a rep, Ainslee must lift the log above her head. It's no easy task. But she has a secret weapon — the noisy crowd. Their words of encouragement and excitement pour out as Ainslee shifts the log from her chest. ""C'mon, Ainslee,"" they scream. ""You've got this!"" They want it nearly as much as Ainslee does. And when she makes the final push and hefts the log above her head, the crowd erupts. Ainslee, a wheelchair user, is one of dozens of competitors at Strong Geelong and while she's no stranger to strength training and competition, the Battle in the Bay marks an important development for her as an athlete and for strength sports in Australia more broadly. Because Battle in the Bay is the first time the sport's peak body, Australia's Strongest, has collaborated with All Abilities Strength to include an all abilities category in a strongwoman or strongman event. Strongwoman and strongman events are tests of strength, often more spectacle than sport. Athletes lift, carry, push or pull enormous weights in events like atlas stone (concrete stones that weigh anything from 17kg to 220kg), log press, yoke carry and deadlift. While today, the log press is not performed with actual logs and atlas stones are specially designed concrete spheres rather than large rocks, there remains something almost medieval about the sport, as if it has time travelled here from the past. For Ainslee, what the sport offers is the chance to test herself and her training but it also offers opportunities to compete in a broader range of events than a traditional powerlifting competition does. ""With powerlifting, all I can do is bench press,"" Ainslee said. ""I'm a wheelchair user so I can't do the squat or the deadlift. ""But with strongman, there's so much more that you can actually do."" Ainslee first competed in strongwoman at an event run by her trainer, Kerryn Taylor, earlier this year. ""I was the only disabled person competing at that comp… so we didn't really know how [it] was going to go, but it was really fun,"" she said. The 43-year-old, who works as a disability inclusion consultant, was encouraged by her partner, who is a powerlifter, and his coach to join them on the weights in 2016 after she experienced a nervous breakdown due to workplace bullying. ""I remember going to the gym, the first time I went in there, my partner trained me, and we worked out. And I just said to him, 'OK, I'm just going to go sit in the car until you're finished'. ""I felt really intimidated."" That feeling soon dissipated and was replaced by one of community and friendship and in 2018, after watching several powerlifting competitions, Ainslee went from spectator to competitor. ""That very first comp I bombed out because I was so nervous,"" Ainslee said. ""I didn't want to get in the way of running things slow or anything like that. But they were so nice and accommodating, even the guys who I used to find scary, like the big burly guys with the tattoos, they were coming up to me and going 'congratulations, well done'. ""And it's like, yeah, okay I've found my place now."" Nicole Brown is the woman behind the Battle in the Bay All Abilities competition. The owner of All Made New, a business dedicated to bringing people from all walks of life to strength training and sports, Nicole has been training and competing in strongman for several years. Her friendship with Ainslee was the catalyst for the development of All Abilities Strength, an All Made New program whose mission is not only to encourage people with disabilities to get involved in strength training and sports but also to ensure strongman and strongwoman events are inclusive. ""Seeing Ainslee train and training strongman was incredibly inspiring, but also listening to her speak about the difficulties as far as accessibility goes,"" Nicole said. ""The fact that there were people that were missing out on the benefits of strength training and training strongman is something that really drove me."" While the Battle in the Bay is not the first time disabled athletes have competed in a strongman or strongwoman competition, Nicole, who is also a nurse, says there hasn't been a coordinated effort to make the sport inclusive. ""There's been a bit of a gap in those competitions for people with a disability. ""There's been here and there competitions that would allow for persons with a disability to compete but today's kind of the first day really, that we've had a competition that is inclusive."" Through All Abilities Strength, Nicole is working with the sport's organising body, Australia's Strongest, and the manufacturer of the equipment, Stand or Submit, to deliver inclusive competitions. ""Traditionally in strongman, you get given a list of rules [for events] and that's what you do, no matter what, that's what you've got to do. We recognise at All Abilities Strength that kind of modus operandi doesn't necessarily work with persons with a disability. ""Our aim is to always adapt [the events] to suit persons with a disability rather than giving them all different events because we want it to be as inclusive as possible. ""Where that's not possible we may change the events."" Back at Strong Geelong, with the log press complete, the focus now shifts to the next event: the sled pull. A metal base with metal uprights forms the base of the sled. Weights are placed on the uprights and a heavy rope is attached to one end. It's this rope that the athletes will use to pull the weighted sled towards themselves. For Justine Martin, who began her involvement in strength sports with tug of war, the rope provides a sense of the familiar. While strongwoman events are new for Justine, she has been in and around strength sports like powerlifting and all-round weight lifting since the mid-2000s. The 51-year-old boasts an impressive collection of medals and a few world records as both an abled and disabled athlete. But Battle in the Bay is the first time she has competed in six years. ""This is a huge event for me to get back to lifting,"" she said. ""It's been such a passion for the last six years. When something's taken away from you without your choice, you want it back."" Justine was diagnosed with Remitting Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis in 2011. In 2016, only a year from the last of three heart surgeries, she was diagnosed with livedo reticularis, which led to later diagnoses of melanoma, mixed cryoglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma. Then, an MS relapse in 2017 put her in hospital and she spent weeks learning to walk again. ""[I] lost so much muscle mass… so, I really pushed to get back into the gym and all I could bench was a three-kilo bar. ""I couldn't leg press, I couldn't do anything. And I just kept going three days a week, and I got stronger."" As the sled pull is loaded with weights and the athletes test out their set up, Justine, who works as a public speaker, artist and author, glows with the thrill of competition. The high from the log press is evident in the smile on her face. ""When I stopped [the log press] I'm like, 'oh my god, I just did that'. I shocked myself on how many reps that I actually did. ""It's been an awesome day. [It's] so good to see everyone get behind everyone else. You kind of lose yourself in the euphoria of it all."" Competing alongside Ainslee and Justine is Justin Boencke, who has flown down from the Northern Territory. Justin has a neurological disability called Charcot-Marie-Tooth, which affects his peripheral nerves. ""The body stops sending the signals to them, so eventually, they just shut down and then die off, which then results in muscle wastage, and balance issues, hand grip issues and things like that. So, this sport is probably the opposite of what I should be doing."" For Justin, the Battle in the Bay All Abilities competition is an opportunity to hopefully encourage other people with a disability to give strength training and sports a go. ""Hopefully I can help other people with my disability go 'Well, why can't I do that?' and try the sport or get into just going to the gym or powerlifting. ""There's a lot of things that we can do, we don't have to sit there and go, that's not for me because I've got this disability. Just have a go. ""I also find that doing this stuff is a good mental break. It's good to help clear your head sometimes."" Many strongwoman and strongman events require specialist equipment. Mason Dannatt runs Stand or Submit, which makes equipment that can be used by people of all abilities. ""Before we were around, the lightest log that you could get was 70 or 80 kilos without any plates on it. So, all these people that were either beginning, or smaller framed, couldn't log press and all the stones were too big, everything was too heavy,"" Mason said. ""We made equipment that was still strong, but lighter in weight, to allow more people to get involved in the sport."" Mason, who also runs Australia's Strongest, the organising body for strongwoman and strongman events, says he would like to see all abilities events at all of the organisation's events but the focus right now is on how to grow the sport sustainably. ""It's always a balancing act with strongman in any of the categories to make sure that we have enough competitors to be able to make it valid to run at a show. ""My goal would be to see all abilities at our top shows at the start of each year and have a qualifying process to get there. The same as all the others."" The final event of the day is the stone to platform. Sitting at a bench with adjustable platforms, the goal is to shift the atlas stone from one platform to the other. One successful shift is one rep. They have 60 seconds to get as many reps as they can. At the bench, Justine grips the stone, her hot pink nails contrasting with the mottled grey concrete. Her hands are covered in Tacky, a product that helps the athletes hold onto the slippery concrete. ""Athlete ready?"" comes the call. Justine nods. She grips the atlas stone tighter and pulls it up and across the bench to the opposite platform. ""One!"" comes the call, acknowledging her first rep. As Justine builds momentum, shifting the stone back and forth, the encouragement from the crowd intensifies, willing her to shift the heavy concrete stone. Sixty seconds seems at once to take forever and be over too soon and time is called. Justine has managed 24 reps and the delight dances across her face. The physical benefits of strength training and sports are obvious, perhaps less obvious is the positive impact on metal wellbeing. Ainslee points to her improved confidence and resilience and says she believes strength training and sports like the Battle in the Bay Strongwoman event have helped her to manage her mental health. ""I've got an anxiety disorder, but once I've lifted those weights or have competed, it's almost like those weights' kind of like, push everything down back into place. Like everything's calm. It reduces the anxiety."" Nicole says there's a challenge around breaking down the stigma that can surround the sport and the accessibility challenges being faced. ""I truly do believe that strength sports and training does have the capacity to benefit you, not only physically, but psychologically, socially — the benefits are incredible. ""[But] some people can find [gyms] incredibly intimidating. ""You can imagine how it might feel for someone in a wheelchair or an amputee or someone with a cognitive disability wanting to go and train. ""They might feel like they don't belong, or that they're not welcome, but it's really not the case. ""We want to make sure that there's the capacity for them to go, when they want to go to the gym. ""My hope is that eventually, I won't have to approach competition organisers to say, 'you should be running an all-abilities category'. I want it to be mainstream and I want it to be universal. ""The ultimate goal with inclusion is that it's just that, that everyone is included."" Inside Strong Geelong, the post competition high radiates off the athletes. Thoughts of results and personal bests, the dissection of performance — that all comes later. Now, the moment is savoured, and relished. ""It's a very proud and historic moment to be a part of and to show other disabled athletes that you can still compete and you can still do things and that you are important and you are part of the community here,"" Justine said. ""I was shocked with how quick things were and how many reps I got out. So the next comp will be to push it even further and see how I can improve."" For Ainslee, the day was a mixed bag — on one hand the excitement of the all abilities competition and on the other, her disappointment with her own performance. ""I didn't perform on the day as well as I would have liked. But on reflection with my coach, there was a lot going on. It was only my second comp,"" Ainslee said. ""Now it's about making sure the next comp works better."" While things may not have gone to plan on the day, Ainslee credits her ability to bounce back from the disappointment to her coach Kerryn, and her focus on training a strong mind alongside a strong body. Ainslee believes there is plenty for All Abilities Strength to take from the competition. ""It's definitely a learning process for all of us… it's just going to mean better comps in the future."" It's this future that keeps Ainslee training and preparing for the next competition. ""I'm just hoping that every single gym in Australia takes it on board and provides opportunities to other disabled athletes.""

110,Sam Kerr is finally getting the global coverage she's always deserved,sport,"  Sam Kerr has always been a footballing juggernaut. Finally, the rest of the world is catching up to her Like so many of football's great moments, this one felt like it happened in slow-motion; as though the universe wanted us to appreciate every small detail — every twitch and flex of muscle, every quirk and bend of physics, every vibration in the air — that made it possible. Sam Kerr watches the ball fall towards her, not dropping from the sky so much as being gently lowered into her path by some invisible hand. Reflexively, her body prepares to receive it: arms stretching balletically for balance, right leg coiling backwards. Her eyes do not waver; they follow the ball from its highest arc all the way down, right to the invisible spot mid-way up her calf where she knows she will hit it. And she does. Sweetly, perfectly. The angle and force of her foot creates a top-spin that changes the ball's trajectory entirely, looping up and over and back down again before settling into the back of the net. It's a stunning goal, the type that you know, as it's happening, is one of the best. But there's few there to see it. Certainly nobody to gasp and applaud, to upload instant highlights of every angle to social media, or nominate it for Goal of the Season. There's just an 18-year-old Kerr, kicking a ball around in the low light of a Canberra football pitch, watched by her team-mates, a blogger, and a scattering of native birds. That was 2012, when Kerr was slowly emerging from the first serious injury that almost ended her career. It's an innocuous video, really. A casual, if slightly nervous, teenager standing on the grass at the Australian Institute of Sport, wrapped in a black hoodie, learning how to answer interview questions on camera. But even back then, you could sense it: the same relaxed, joyful attitude that has come to characterise her entire playing style. You can feel her wanting desperately to overcome the thing that's holding her back -- which, more often than not, has been herself. A decade on, the same freedom and delight in football that saw her score that training-pitch goal is the same that saw her score one of the most iconic goals in Women's Super League history: a spin-and-volley of such outrageous technique and timing that, this time, it actually did go viral. And Kerr was just as nonchalant about it afterwards as she was 10 years ago. ""Just get it in the back of the net,"" she shrugged on the broadcast coverage. ""The first one, it just popped up. I don't normally hit it left foot but thought, 'why not? Give it a crack.' And then yeah, top bins. ""And then the second one [...] it sat up nicely and I thought, 'I'm just gonna whack it.' ""I try that type of stuff at training all the time. I think one of my strengths as a player is I try things that maybe other players wouldn’t try. ""Sometimes it comes off, sometimes it doesn’t. But a really big part of my game is seeing myself in moments before it actually gets there, so when it comes, I feel super calm."" That's the thing about Sam Kerr. She has always been this way. The talent and focus has always been there — if a little unrefined, if a little rusty and raw, if a little delayed by the two major injuries she sustained aged 18 and 21. Talk to any of her earliest coaches and they'll say they saw it before anyone else did. “Even back at that age, she was just somebody who would do something and you’d go ‘wow, who’s this girl?’ She just had those qualities,"" said former Matildas coach Tom Sermanni, who handed Kerr her first national team cap as a 15-year-old. “People talk about playing with a smile on your face, and playing football like you really enjoy it, and giving everything you can – she had that from the minute she walked in the team. ""I think she’s still got that. She’s a hardened professional, but she still plays football like she’s playing in the backyard for fun."" She was never afraid of trying the audacious, of trusting her body to do the things her ambitious mind wanted. Increasingly, over the years, those two aspects have aligned. “For someone who was still at a relatively young age, her dedication to getting better in what she wanted to do was the thing that shone through, and the thing that’s continued to serve her so well,"" said Jamie Harnwell, Kerr's head coach at hometown club Perth Glory where she began her transition from winger to striker in 2014. “Certainly the after-training finishing (practice), we had some really great role models, Kate Gill would do the same thing, she’d be doing extras, Collette McCallum had been around the game for ages taking free-kicks and doing the works. “Sam was dedicated to making sure that whatever she needed to do, she did.” Her dedication off the pitch has translated into success on it. Starting in 2012, she has won more individual accolades and broken more records than almost any other Australian athlete in history: seven Golden Boots on three different continents, 10 team trophies across several competitions, multiple MVP awards and Team of the Year selections, even an Order of Australia — the first ever presented to an active footballer — in the same year she became the country's all-time leading goal-scorer. So, if she has always been a superstar, what's changed? It's that now, finally, the rest of the world is paying attention. And they cannot get enough. Anything Kerr does — be it scoring goals or celebrating them, winning prestigious awards alongside the best in the men's game, flattening pitch invaders in otherwise-forgettable matches, even sharing a moment with her partner on Instagram — immediately generates a flurry of activity. And that has created an interesting shift not just in Kerr's life, but also in the larger momentum of the women's game. Because the 28-year-old is now entering the rarefied air often reserved for her male counterparts: the world of athlete-as-celebrity, the world where she is no longer the moral spokesperson for the club or the sport she represents, the world where she is no longer begging for coverage. Instead, these days, coverage is begging for her. One-on-one interviews with Kerr have become almost impossible to secure. Journalists flock to any all-in opportunity they're offered. Layers upon layers of management insulate her from the nastier parts of stardom, giving her the autonomy and power to control how she spends her energy, and to whom she gives her time. This one sign, perhaps, that the women's game is truly progressing: its brightest players are no longer treated as charity cases of media coverage, and that they no longer feel a sense of responsibility to promote their game to anyone who bothers paying attention. Kerr is arguably the first woman footballer to flip the dynamic. A decade ago, women footballers like her were lucky to have any media interest at all. Now, you're lucky if Kerr is interested in you. And while this protective bubble may suggest a kind of distancing from the community that has evolved around her, Kerr remains by all accounts entirely herself to those that matter: her friends and family, her team-mates, her staff, her fans. She is still the relaxed Fremantle girl cracking jokes in the corner of the dressing-room; the loyal friend who'd put it all on the line for those she cares about; the bubbly, fearless teenager who tries ridiculous things at training just because she can, or because it gets a laugh. Tonight, she will play at Wembley in her second straight FA Cup final in front of over 50,000 people. The last time she was here, she was named Player of the Match after scoring two audacious goals, including a chip that gave Chelsea a commanding 3-0 win over Arsenal. If she wins this weekend, she'll add another paragraph to her already-heaving chapter of history: becoming the first Australian to win two FA Cup finals. And the world's media will be there, watching and dissecting and discussing her every move. Her dynamic runs will be analysed on computer-generated models, her goal contributions will be broken down from every high-definition angle, her celebrations will be tweeted and shared and liked, and she will be swamped by journalists and fans in equal measure after the final whistle has long faded into the Wembley sky. Her abilities on a pitch have rarely, if ever, been questioned. But before Sam Kerr became Sam Kerr, they were also rarely seen. A lot has changed in the decade since that cool Canberra afternoon where a young Perth girl tried trick-shots for fun and learned what it was like to speak into the barrel of a camera.

111,"Vixens, Fever post wins ahead of Super Netball top-of-the-ladder blockbuster",sport," Sport Melbourne Vixens, West Coast Fever post wins ahead of Super Netball top-of-the-ladder blockbuster The Melbourne Vixens have set up a midweek top-of-the-ladder clash against the West Coast Fever after a thrilling 66-63 extra-time win over the Giants in Sydney. The Vixens' win kept them second on percentage behind the Fever, who earlier on Saturday defeated the struggling Lightning 74-65 on the Sunshine Coast. The Fever will host the Vixens in Perth on Tuesday. The Giants trailed by 11 points in the second and third quarters at Ken Rosewall Arena, but sensational two-point shooting from youngster Matisse Letherbarrow kept them in the game. The 20-year-old, who came on late in the second quarter for captain Jo Harten, showed nerves of steel. She made eight of her first nine super shots as the Giants surged to a 60-57 lead with just over three minutes to go. The Vixens scored the last three points, with former Giant Kiera Austin levelling the game with her team's only successful two-point attempt. The teams traded the first six goals of the extra-time period before Melbourne's Mwai Kumwenda completed a superb individual effort by scoring the last three of the match to finish with 50 goals from as many attempts. Captain and centre Liz Watson was a huge contributor to the Vixens win, notching 28 goal assists and 46 feeds in an influential effort. With just one win separating third from eighth, the loss could be significant for the fourth-placed Giants, whose next two matches are away in Tasmania and Perth. Jamaican Jhaniele Fowler produced another prodigious and almost perfect shooting display to help the Fever consolidated top spot on the ladder. The Fever's third straight victory left the Lightning in serious danger of missing the finals for the first time. The competition's leading scorer, Fowler made all 66 of her conventional shots and her only miss of the night was with her final attempt, which was from two-point range. A 22-11 second quarter tilted the match in the visiting Fever's favour after they trailed by two early in the term. West Coast led by as many as 12 in the third period and did a better job of controlling possession and forcing the Lightning into errors. Aside from playing netball at the top level, NSW Swifts co-captain and midcourter Maddy Proud has found a passion for writing books. They tallied three more intercepts, five more gains and had seven less general play turnovers. While Fowler proved unstoppable offensively and the Lightning could no restrict her supply, Courtney Bruce was influential at the other end. Bruce gathered five intercepts, nine gains and 10 deflections. The Lightning trailed by five early, but captain and goal attack Steph Wood dragged her side back into the contest with three super shots, as the home team led 19-18 at quarter-time. Fowler scored eight goals to the Lightning's one early in the second quarter as the visitors regained control and never relinquished the lead.

112,"Melbourne weren't really 'the Storm', but Penrith were at peak Panther. What did we see in Magic Round's main event?",sport," Sport Penrith Panthers make it look easy against an injury-hit Storm in a Magic Round game that couldn't live up to the hype With every hour that ticked down to the hotly anticipated game between the table-topping Melbourne Storm and reigning premiers Penrith, it seemed another big name was out. Storm fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen was the big one, cut down in perhaps the best form of his career, with centre Reimis Smith's injury causing a complete backline reshuffle. Then Cleary was a matchday scratching. Mercifully, though, it was coach Ivan rather than his son. Then, a few hours before kick-off, Storm halfback Jahrome Hughes succumbed to a calf strain. In a couple of strokes of red pen, what was supposed to be a game between two star-studded teams in their pomp was once again reduced to a case of one full-strength team going up against a near-unrecognisable group. It may sound like an exaggeration to suggest one or two injuries can have that sort of impact on a team like the Storm, but there was a clear ripple effect. Papenhuyzen's injury meant an initial shuffle of Nick Meaney going from the wing to fullback, meaning Dean Ieremia and Marion Seve would have to form a brand new wing-centre combination. Perhaps fearing the Panthers would score 300 points down that wing, coach Craig Bellamy reshuffled again, with substitute hooker Tyran Wishart channelling his father Rod and sliding to a custodial role, leaving Meaney in number two. Hughes would have been a natural candidate to fill in at the back, but his injury put paid to that idea, as well as the idea of moving Cameron Munster back there, because the Storm needed at least one experienced head in the halves. Bellamy also split up the experienced outside backs, with Justin Olam on the left and Xavier Coates on the right, but it mattered little. In the opening 10 minutes, Seve had been targeted for two Panthers tries and the makeshift fullback had knocked on a relatively simple support run, which led directly to the second of those. Jarome Luai's try to start the second-half scoring was also a result of targeting Seve's corridor, and Wishart's confidence looked dead and buried by the end of a horror night under high balls, low balls, fast balls, sliders, off-speed pitches and anything else the Panthers felt like throwing at him. Storm fans needn't despair too much — the same thing happened in the other direction in round 20 last year. The 2020 grand finalists faced off a bit more than a month out from finals, but Penrith was being captained by Dylan Edwards, which should tell you something about how little they resembled themselves. No Cleary (Nathan this time), Isaah Yeo, Brian To'o, Kurt Capewell or James Fisher-Harris led to a 37-10 win for the Storm; a far cry from the 10-6 loss to Penrith in the preliminary final nine weeks later. So what can we really glean from these games? Give Melbourne an off-season and they can turn anyone into a top-flight NRL player. They've done it for the better part of two decades now. But in Penrith, it barely takes them a week. Every time one of their top guys goes down, there's another flyer or bullocking ball-runner ready and waiting. We've seen it this season, with Taylan May making such an impression stepping in for Brian To'o that he forced Charlie Staines out of the side. He or Stephen Crichton could be the best fullback in plenty of sides, but the Panthers have Dylan Edwards. There might be better fullbacks in the NRL than Penrith's Dylan Edwards, but nobody is better for the Panthers, writes Nick Campton. Sean O'Sullivan started the season looking like a player worth $700,000 a year, before making way for Cleary to return. The Storm, meanwhile, are realising their seemingly endless run of developing stars is, not necessarily coming to an end, but in an ebb. Ryan Papenhuyzen is now THE guy at the back. It's possible Bellamy tried to get a bit too cute in putting Wishart back there to replace him, because Cleary gave him hell under rainy skies. The step down from Jahrome Hughes to Cooper Johns was noticeable, to put it mildly. And the Harry Grant-Brandon Smith combo is no longer a double-barrelled dummy-half luxury; they need Grant at his best at hooker and Smith peaking as a fringe ball-runner. Injuries to any of them, or God forbid two of them, and suddenly the Storm are looking a little thin. If an opposing team manages to put a Penrith player on their back with any sort of regularity, there should be a parade. If you've ever watched the Panthers roll up the field in the blink of an eye and wondered how they do it, a series of intentional powerful faceplants is how. Every tackle is a battle between the player with the ball trying to land on their belly and spring up as quickly as possible, and a defence trying to land them on their back and keep them there for as long as possible. On a night when four NRL teams took to the park, the Brisbane Broncos looked the best of the bunch. After the last two years, if that's not enough to make you believe in magic, nothing is. The Panthers almost always win that battle. Not only do they make good, fast metres, when they are finally brought to ground they're back on their feet and playing the ball before you know it. Stopping that from happening is nigh impossible, but responding in kind is almost certainly necessary. If you want to make metres on them, you have to catch the defence back-tracking and that likely means take the risk of trying to play the ball before your body is really ready. The risk is you make a mistake, give the ball back to the Panthers and they maul you, but those are the stakes when you play against the best. There is a certain rhythm to NRL games, even when very good rugby league teams are involved. But not as far as Penrith is concerned. There is not a moment, on either side of the ball, that you truly know what is going to happen. Offloads and clever plays are one thing, but when the play breaks down, no team (maybe ever) is more dangerous. All across the park — from To'o to Tago, Crichton to Cleary, Koroisau to Kikau, and Luai all on his own — if the ball goes to ground, they can wreck the suddenly frozen or relaxed defence at will. It's part of why teams get so frustrated against them — 'I passed the test, I shut you down, why won't you just stop?'. In defence it's a similar story. Attackers are supposed to have a couple of tackles to truck it off their own tryline. Maybe they don't get as far as they want to, but that's usually it. When Penrith is defending, they attack. There's no spot too far away from the tryline that they can't drag you back into the in-goal. There's nowhere within 20 minutes of the sideline that you're not under threat of being lobbed into touch. Fall asleep for one second, think you've got things in hand for a moment and that's when they pounce. Without Papenhuyzen and Hughes, it was left up to Munster to embody the title of ""pivot"" more than ever before. And he did his level best. His swirling kick-off found the grass, then he forced a knock-on from Jarome Luai, and launched a torpedo bomb that again bamboozled the Panthers' back three. Later, he found the in-goal with another uncatchable bomb, and when Taylan May Houdini'd his way past four would-be Storm tacklers and out of danger, Munster took it upon himself to rip the ball out of Dylan Edwards's hands. He got the ball soon after and chipped over the top for Nick Meaney and the Storm's only try of the night. Late in the first half he somehow stared down a rampaging Stephen Crichton and held him up basically all on his own. It all ended up being for nought — fighting Penrith while undermanned is like fighting the tide with handful of sand — but his performance showed how hard he is willing to fight for this side and what he can do. If only he had a little more support we might have had something close to a contest.

113,Hockeyroos stay unbeaten in NZ after draw with Black Sticks,sport," Sport Australia's Hockeyroos draw 1-1 with New Zealand in trans-Tasman series A first international goal from Shanea Tonkin has kept the Hockeyroos undefeated in the trans-Tasman series following a 1-1 draw with New Zealand in the penultimate match in Auckland. Tonkin struck on the stroke of half-time after Alia Jacques handed the Black Sticks a sixth-minute lead. The Hockeyroos drew 2-2 with the Black Sticks in Tuesday's series opener before recording a 2-1 victory in the second match on Thursday. Hannah Cullum-Sanders sent an early warning sign to the Black Sticks with a purposeful run into the attacking circle but the 18-year-old could not get her shot on target. With the Black Sticks players also pushing their claims for World Cup and Commonwealth Games selection, the home side went ahead when they picked apart the Hockeyroos defence to score through Jacques. The Hockeyroos won their first penalty corner of the match five minutes before half-time, but Maddy Fitzpatrick's drag flick was saved by Black Sticks goalkeeper Grace O'Hanlon. Steph Kershaw then found Mariah Williams with a pass in the attacking circle just before the break, with the striker hammering a powerful effort off the back foot. Tonkin produced a classy deflection, giving O'Hanlon no chance. Both sides created decent chances in the second half, with Karri Somerville proving solid in the Hockeyroos defence through some crucial intercepts. Goalkeeper Jocelyn Bartram was required to keep her nerve to diffuse a threatening Black Sticks opportunity when the home side had a two-on-one situation in the circle, keeping the Hockeyroos on level terms. The Hockeyroos were forced to defend the Black Sticks' first penalty corner in the last play of the match, which they did successfully to make it six draws from the teams' past 11 meetings. The final match of the series will be played in Auckland on Sunday.

114,Panthers back on top of ladder after thrashing understrength Storm in Magic Round clash,sport," Sport Penrith Panthers thrash Melbourne Storm 32-6 in NRL Magic Round as Gold Coast and South Sydney record victories Penrith has moved to the top of the premiership ladder after brushing the Melbourne Storm aside in a 32-6 win during the NRL's Magic Round on Saturday night. Earlier, Gold Coast got past St George Illawarra with a 20-16 golden-point win, while South Sydney held on to defeat a fast-finishing Warriors outfit 32-30. In front of 46,454 spectators at Brisbane's Lang Park, Penrith never relented after scoring two tries inside the opening 10 minutes. The Storm were down on star power, with fullback Ryan Papenhuyzen (knee) and centre Reimis Smith (pectoral) both injured in last Sunday's win over the Dragons, while halfback Jahrome Hughes (calf) pulled out on match day. It was the first time the two sides had faced each other since last year's preliminary final on the same ground when the Storm were also outplayed. The Panthers were ruthless when it came to capitalising on the Storm's mistakes. And there was some immediate concern the Storm might lose another of their star spine members in the opening set of the match. Harry Grant got up groggily after he received an ugly knock while attempting to tackle James Fisher-Harris. Grant was given the all-clear to play on but it was those stepping up from reserve grade who allowed the Panthers to hit an early lead. The Panthers sensed a vulnerability in Melbourne's right-edge defence, which contained halfback Cooper Johns and Marion Seve at centre in their first matches of the season. Izack Tago ran through a big hole Seve left for the Panthers' first try, before Viliame Kikau outjumped the Storm centre to add Penrith's second after nine minutes. Melbourne rallied with a well-weighted kick from five-eighth Cameron Munster that was easily regathered for Nick Meaney to score but it was the Storm's only try of the night. Cleary responded by adding a penalty for the Panthers and then targeted another stand-in, this time fullback Tyran Wishart, with one of his aerial bombs. Wishart dropped the ball under pressure from Kikau and Tago touched down to give the Panthers a 20-6 lead at half-time. Melbourne kept Penrith at bay for the first 15 minutes of the second half but the pressure told when Kikau ran at Johns and the Fijian international offloaded to Jarome Luai to score. Stephen Crichton added another try for Penrith in the 62nd minute. Panthers coach Ivan Cleary was not given clearance to travel after having an operation on his knee but is likely to be back on deck for next week's match against the Sydney Roosters. A golden-point try to Gold Coast's Jamayne Isaako has secured the Titans a thrilling win over St George Illawarra, snapping a five-match losing run. A knock-on by Dragons' five-eighth Talatau Amone in the second half of the extra period gifted the Titans field position and after spreading the ball wide, Isaako just held onto the ball to dive over and claim the crucial win after 89 minutes. It came after a heart-stopping first half of golden point where Isaako and Zac Lomax missed field goal shots. Both teams scored three tries apiece in regulation time to be level 16-16 at full-time with recalled forward Jarrod Wallace's close-range 73rd-minute try cancelling out what Moses Suli thought would be the winner for the Dragons just four minutes before. The Titans made a bright start, sparked by captain Tino Fa'asumaleaui's big hit on Jack De Belin in the opening minutes. Their enterprise was reward when a Toby Sexton bomb was batted back by Phillip Sami and eventually worked to AJ Brimson, who dived over for his second try of the year. The Titans enjoyed a period of dominance as they forced the Dragons into five straight line drop-outs. Despite Josh McGuire being sin-binned for a professional foul, the Dragons held out the Titans and levelled the scores when Mathew Feagai crossed in the 21st minute with McGuire still off the field. Gold Coast managed to snatch back the lead in the 28th minute when Beau Fermor pounced on a Sexton grubber to give the Titans a 10-4 half-time lead. McGuire did not return for the second half as his 250th match ended early due to a groin injury but with Hunt steering proceedings, the Dragons levelled again in the 54th minute when De Belin crashed over for his second try in as many weeks. Returning Jayden Campbell's 60th-minute break, where he stepped through several Dragons tackles down the middle of the field, had the crowd on their feet before Brimson took it within 10 metres of the line. But Gold Coast was unable to back up their young fullback's work with a knock-on just moments later. When Sami was placed on report for a shoulder charge as Mikaele Ravalawa tried to force his way over in the corner, Lomax stepped up to kick the penalty goal and put the Dragons in front for the first time in the match with 15 minutes to play. Suli barrelled over in the 69th minute and the Dragons appeared to be heading to a win but Wallace's rampaging effort moments later again levelled the scores and set up a grandstand finish. Neither team could find a field goal to win the match in the remaining five minutes before the extra period and Isaako's dramatic winner. After trailing 26-0 in the first half and 32-6 in the final quarter of the game, the Warriors launched an audacious comeback attempt against Souths, only to fall agonisingly short. Against 12 Rabbitohs for the final six minutes, the Warriors scored twice at the death to put the fear of God into Souths, but could not get in position for a Hail Mary two-point field goal to level the scores. Coming off a disappointing loss to Brisbane, South Sydney came out with a point to prove in the first game of Saturday's NRL action, with five-eighth Cody Walker orchestrating a five-try opening half-hour. Marcelo Montoya got one back for the Warriors on the stroke of half-time, but when Souths crossed through Lachlan Ilias to start the second stanza, it seemed like game over. But the New Zealanders refused to go away, sending Adam Pompey and Jazz Tevaga over in the 64th and 69th minutes respectively before Shaun Johnson narrowly missed out on a solo grubber-and-chase effort. He looked furious with his own fullback, Reece Walsh, for running him off the ball with the four points his for the taking, but the bunker ruled Walsh had been illegally bumped by Damien Cook in his chase.Team stats Cook was sent to the sin bin for the final six minutes of the game and no sooner had he left the ground than Daejarn Asi scooted over for the Warriors. Montoya added his second in the 78th minute and Walsh's conversion made it 32-30, leaving the Warriors a minute to get into field-goal range, but they could not get there, with Johnson's rushed 50-metre shot charged down, ending the game.

115,Lightweight Bombers disappoint again as Swans run rampant at the SCG,sport," Sport Sydney smash Essendon as Bombers crash to new low at SCG, St Kilda make a statement against Geelong Sydney have bounced back from consecutive losses on their home deck to thump Essendon by 58 points at the SCG. Superstar forward Lance Franklin again haunted the Bombers and was instrumental when the match was on the line to help set up the 14.21 (105) to 6.11 (47) victory on Saturday night. Franklin ended the match with 2.4 but had as much impact with his all-round display and passed off several shots on goal when well within his range. He has now tormented the Bombers with 77 goals, the most he has kicked against any AFL club. It was a disappointing performance from the Bombers who were unable to toast captain Dyson Heppell's 200th match with a competitive effort. Heppell finished with 23 disposals but didn't have enough teammates in support. The Bombers were on the back foot from early in the contest but were hammered 54-30 for tackles while being beaten 137-124 in contested possessions. Sydney co-captain Callum Mills (29 disposals, 13 tackles) helped set the tone and was well supported by Chad Warner (32 disposals) and Errol Gulden (26), while Tom Papley (21 touches, 2 goals) looked back to his best after a delayed start to the season. The Bombers have now slumped to a 2-7 record and have much to do to return to finals for the second consecutive year after recovering from a 2-6 start last season. While there were few highlights on the night for the Bombers, their in-form spearhead Peter Wright looked to inspire his team with a 65m bomb from a set shot late in the second term. Darcy Parish (31 disposals) battled hard in the midfield and Andrew McGrath was busy across half-back (22) while Jordan Ridley (22) fought back in the second half to reduce Franklin's influence. The Swans were looking for a fast start after leading at the first change only twice in the opening eight rounds, and a noticeable lift in intensity helped them win the tackle (12-5) and clearance (11-4) counts while taking a 20-point margin into quarter-time. The strong opening was capped off by a rousing goal to Sam Wicks after the small forward got out the back of the Bombers' defence, almost stumbled with ball in hand until steadying just enough to slam it through on the run as the siren sounded. The previous five matches between the teams were decided by an average of six points but the Swans all but ensured this would be a more comfortable margin with four goals to two in the second term as the Bombers were ultimately flattered by the final score. After three consecutive matches at the SCG the Swans will hit the road to face Carlton on Friday night, while Essendon will look to get their season back on track against Richmond the following night. Brisbane livewire Charlie Cameron has torched his former AFL club Adelaide with four goals in a 36-point away victory for the Lions. Brisbane came from 15 points down in the second quarter to overpower the Crows, winning 16.6 (102) to 9.12 (66) at Adelaide Oval on Saturday night. Cameron, Brownlow medallist Lachie Neale (35 disposals, one goal, seven clearances) and Zac Bailey (three goals, 19 touches) were instrumental as the Lions took top spot on the ladder ahead of Sunday's games. Captain Dayne Zorko (26 possessions, two goals), Hugh McCluggage (22 disposals), Jarryd Lyons (24, eight clearances) and Daniel Rich (26) were other standouts in the Lions' eighth win from nine matches this season. Adelaide forward Shane McAdam booted three goals and Ned McHenry kicked two. Acting Crows captain Ben Keays (27 disposals, 10 clearances), Jordan Dawson (24 touches), Jackson Hately (27, one goal) and Rory Laird (32 possessions, 10 tackles) battled gamely. But Adelaide remain in the mire in 14th spot with three wins after being flattened by a powerful Brisbane surge. The Lions slipped 15 points down when McAdam slotted his third goal in the 23rd minute of the second stanza. But Brisbane emphatically responded to the challenge, kicking the next eight goals of the game and 11 of the next dozen. After Adelaide's Taylor Walker scored the game's first major, the Lions went on a run of four consecutive goals including two from ex-Crow Cameron. Brisbane held a 5.2 to 3.3 quarter-time lead before the tide turned Adelaide's way in the second term. The Crows kicked four unanswered goals, with two each to McHenry and McAdam, to take a 15 point lead. McHenry's first came amid controversy as he snapped a goal after picking up a ball which had clearly gone out of bounds within metres of the boundary umpire, who inexplicably failed to whistle. The Crows led by three points at half-time, 7.6 to 7.3, but were overwhelmed by a Brisbane blitz in the third quarter. In a barnstorming 25 minutes, Brisbane booted six goals to none with Cameron, who left the Crows after the 2017 season, adding two more and missing another set shot. Brisbane's burst created a 28-point buffer at three quarter-time and the Lions then cruised to victory in a tame last term by adding three goals goals to one against the flagging Crows, who mustered just two majors in the entire second half. A stunning third-quarter blitz and Paddy Ryder's ruck-forward masterclass have helped St Kilda improve their AFL finals credentials with a 10-point win over Geelong. The Saints prevailed 13.12 (90) to 11.14 (80) on Saturday in the only round-nine contest between two top-eight sides. But it came at a cost as small forward Jack Higgins was substituted out under concussion protocols for the second time this season. Geelong held the upper hand in an arm wrestle until midway through the third quarter, when St Kilda suddenly flicked a switch. Ruck pair Ryder and Rowan Marshall both set up goals with their tap work as the Saints slammed on five majors in a 10-minute burst to seize momentum. A seventh goal for the term, kicked by Tim Membrey on the three-quarter time siren, gave them a 16-point advantage after they had trailed by 22 points soon after the main break. A ferocious spray by coach Chris Scott at the final change spurred Geelong into action and they got back within three points through two quick goals from Tom Hawkins. But Ryder, who had been the game's most influential ruckman to that point, pushed forward and responded with two goals of his own to steady the ship. Ryder finished with three majors and had a hand in several others in a match-winning display. Jade Gresham (30 disposals), Jack Sinclair (31) and Brad Crouch (36) were all outstanding for the Saints as Membrey and Max King kicked two goals apiece. Hawkins booted four for Geelong and Zach Tuohy kicked two, while Joel Selwood and Patrick Dangerfield battled hard in the midfield. But the Saints had too many winners when it mattered most. Higgins was substituted out of the match before half-time following a bump from Jake Kolodjashnij that could land the Cats defender in hot water. Kolodjashnij also performed the tackle that led to Saints skipper Jack Steel's shoulder injury, which was assessed at half-time. Steele was moved forward after the main break and saw out the match. It was St Kilda's first win over Geelong since round 14, 2016. Richmond have survived a late scare to beat Hawthorn by 23 points in their AFL clash at the MCG. A four-goal run from the Hawks reduced the deficit to 10 points with less than three minutes left, but Richmond steadied and won 17.15 (117) to 14.10 (94). As the Hawks pressed, Jason Castagna smothered a Denver Grainger-Barras kick out of defence and then goaled to kill off the challenge. Tigers star Shai Bolton then followed up with an outstanding running goal. The Hawks could have put Richmond under even more pressure late in the game, but James Worpel sprayed his shot at goal. Bolton's second term was critical for the Tigers and he finished with two goals, while co-captain Toby Nankervis dominated the ruck and Dion Prestia made a successful return from injury. Hawthorn troubled Richmond early and led by seven points at the first break, but suffered a major blow on the quarter-time siren when Jack Gunston was hurt in a marking contest. Gunston tried to return early in the second term, but only lasted a couple of minutes before he limped off and was subbed out of the match. Despite losing one of their most experienced players, the Hawks kicked the first three goals of the second quarter to lead by 25 points. Then the Tigers scored two goals against the run of play, first a soccer-style strike from Jack Graham and then a stunning snap from captain Toby Nankervis. Suddenly, Hawthorn's momentum was gone and with Bolton roaring into top gear, the Tigers took control. Richmond kicked six goals to four and had a six-point lead at the main break, extending that to 19 points at the last change. Dustin Martin snapped a freak goal in the third, while at the other end Hawthorn's Sam Butler was denied a goal on debut by fellow first-gamer Bigoa Nyuon. The Richmond backman created enough doubt with his desperate lunge on the goal line for the score to be confirmed a touched behind on video review. Tom Lynch kicked four goals for Richmond, but defender James Sicily was solid on him and was the Hawks' best player. The Tigers lost Noah Balta in the third quarter with a hamstring injury. In-form Port Adelaide have inflicted more pain on an under-fire North Melbourne with a 69-point AFL win in Hobart. Despite missing skipper Tom Jonas in defence due to health and safety protocols, the Power pocketed their fourth straight victory on the back of a six-goal-to-one first quarter. Tall forwards Mitch Georgiades (three goals), Todd Marshall (three) and Jeremy Finlayson (two) did the damage in the 17.13 (115) to 6.10 (46) result on Saturday afternoon. Port Adelaide midfielder Ollie Wines was outstanding, picking up a game-high 32 touches, two goals, nine clearances and two goals assists. The Kangaroos have slumped to their seventh loss in a row after a week in which they made headlines for the wrong reasons. It was revealed coach David Noble issued an apology to his players for delivering a stern post-match address after their heavy 108-point loss to Brisbane in round three. North Melbourne copped a big blow pre-game, with midfield gun Jy Simpkin ruled out late with a hamstring problem. It didn't get much better early on, as Port Adelaide dominated contested possession to race to a 41-6 lead at quarter-time. North Melbourne won the second quarter 16-15 and could have been in a better position on the scoreboard if not for simple misses by Jaidyn Stephenson and Tarryn Thomas in front of goal. Cameron Zurhaar (three goals) was a bright spark for the Kangaroos, with three majors for the match, including a brace in a tightly fought third quarter in which both sides kicked two goals. Port Adelaide, who are on the rise after a horror 0-5 start to the season, pulled away with a run of five goals early in the final term. They play Geelong on the road next round, while North Melbourne face a massive challenge against undefeated reigning premiers Melbourne.

116,"Club celebrates 100 years of 'the thought sport', a nasty game for nice people",sport,"  Nowra Croquet Club celebrates 100 years of playing 'the thought sport', a nasty game for nice people Those who play croquet say it is 15 per cent skill and 85 per cent psychology, an aggressive game played by nice people with a smile on their face. The nice people of Nowra Croquet Club celebrate a century of play this year, and today launch a book acknowledging and celebrating 100 years since the club's inception. Secretary of Nowra Croquet Club, Karen James, instigated the production of the book. It proudly highlights a unique feature of the club — being largely women-only for a majority of its history. But it is not a ladies club anymore. ""Our first male, as is shown in the book, did not become a member until 1982, so that's a long time of it being [only for] ladies, and of course they played in long skirts."" ""Ladies played to the side with their mallet because it was unseemly for a woman to push a mallet between her legs."" Patience, persistence, and a playful spirit is required for this hard-hitting game. ""It's called 'the thought sport' and that's particularly important for us older people,"" said 82-year-old player David Knott. The Nowra Croquet Club and members play a big role Mr Knott's life, who joined the club five years ago and plays frequently. ""It's a very strategic game and there is a lot of thought in it,"" Mr Knott said. ""You're looking to outsmart your opponent. You're looking for the position of their balls versus the position of your own balls. You have to assess what stroke you are going to make for the benefit of scoring that hoop. ""The art is moving the opponents' balls as far away as possible."" ""You have to think and you're exercising all the time. That's the important thing — you keep moving."" Pam Harrison started playing croquet when she was 89. She is now 91 and not only does she love it, according to club members she is also quite good. ""You can still play croquet with a walker, you just have to leave it there for a moment while you grab your mallet and hit the ball, then come back to your walker,"" Ms Harrison said. ""I love it. Anybody who has got a walker and thinks they should come, just come, because you'll be made very welcome."" Doug Cornish, vice-captain and grounds coordinator at the club, agrees the game employs something akin to war tactics. ""A lot of players will say it's an aggressive game played by nice people with a smile on their face,"" he said. Out on the lawn you have four options. ""It's all about deciding whether you can run a hoop, or whether you need to clear an opponent or block an opponent, or promote your partner ball,"" he said. However, Mr Cornish said a key ingredient to a good game was patience. ""Don't rush in. Look at what your options are, and then if you want to get really technical you'd look at what the percentage of performing a particular shot is,"" he said. Karen James believes that at their club, which supports over 60 members, players understand the importance of sport. ""People are realising, for longevity, the importance of sport,"" she said. ""[It is important] to keep going and to keep not only physically active but socially active, so you are interacting as well. ""This game is perfect for those people who can't run the marathon any more or swing a golf club or even bend down to bowl.""

117,A-League Men finals preview: can anyone stop Melbourne City's history-making run?,sport,"  A-League Men 2021/22 finals preview: the contenders, the pretenders, and the best of the rest It may not suit the football purist's idea of the game, but after sixteen years of finals football — a rapid series of knock-out matches that rewards the fittest team on the day rather than over the course of a season — there is little doubt it has become one of the A-League Men's most thrilling and defining features. From Sydney FC's inaugural championship victory in the competition's first season in 2006 to last year's triumph by the league's newest dynasty in Melbourne City and everything in between, the now-or-never terror of elimination football can often throw up a slew of unexpected moments and results. It's perhaps fitting that this season's A-League Men's top six — the first to not feature a team from the Greater Sydney region since the competition began — are a reflection of the unpredictable nature of finals football. So what have we got to look forward to as the tumultuous 2021/22 season draws to a close? Regular season: 1st (Premiers) Head coach: Patrick Kisnorbo First finals game: Two-legged semi-final against lowest-ranked elimination final winner City are emerging as the ALM's new heavyweights. While they took some time finding themselves after being taken over by the lucrative City Football Group in mid-2014, the club has dominated in recent seasons, becoming just the second men's team to win back-to-back premierships (after Sydney FC in 2016-2018) and could become the first to claim consecutive championships. The consistency of Socceroos striker Jamie Maclaren has been a big reason for that, taking out the league's Golden Boot in each of the last three seasons, as well as the smart signings of internationals such as Frenchman Florin Berenguer and Portugal's Nuno Reis, complemented by a scattering of young stars. However, despite arguably looking the best on paper, City won the premiership by just a single point, earned on the final day after a resurgence from cross-town rivals Melbourne Victory. Questions around the fitness of key players continue to swirl, and there are some creeping doubts given their failure to beat any of the other top four teams this season, but given their firm experience in finals football and the slick, lethal style that's seen them score the most goals in the league, they're in with a real chance of doing the double. Regular season: 2nd Head coach: Tony Popovic First finals game: Two-legged semi-final against highest-ranked elimination final winner From wooden-spooners to title contenders, Melbourne Victory's resurgence has been one of the stories of the season. Pipped to the premiership by a single point, Victory's turn-around under new coach Tony Popovic has been miraculous given their stuttering start to the season. Now unbeaten in their past 15 games, Victory are one of the in-form teams heading into finals and boast the league's best defensive record with just 25 goals conceded thanks to a back line anchored by Portugal's Roderick Miranda and flanked by the two brilliant Jasons in Geria and Davidson. Up front, the likes of the deadly Kiwi winger Marco Rojas and electric striker Nick D'Agostino who are blistering in transition, combined with the creativity of midfielder Jake Brimmer, has seen Victory tally up the goals and rekindle the love of a once-dwindling fanbase. The energy of a home Victory crowd can't be understated, particularly as the chips have fallen in such a way that the club may not even have to leave Victoria during this mad dash to the finish. Regular season: 3rd Head coach: John Aloisi First finals game: Elimination final v Wellington Phoenix Despite their off-field struggles to bed down a local identity and fanbase — partly driven by their lack of a home stadium, which they had to share with the two other Melbourne teams this season — Western United have managed to finish a best-ever third after joining the ALM in the 2019-20 season. While they stumbled somewhat towards season's close, they finished just three points behind the rampaging Victory under the guidance of former Socceroo John Aloisi, who has established the second-strongest defensive teams in the league. Western have a unique ability to become a brick wall when required, having equalled the top flight record for 1-0 wins in a single season, marshalled from the back by stand-out centre-back Leo Lacroix and full-back Ben Garuccio, as well as veteran goalkeeper Jamie Young, though the loss of fellow defender Nikolai Topor-Stanley has been felt. The club have also struggled to find the back of the net somewhat - particularly without injured captain Alessandro Diamanti pulling the strings in midfield - with top scorer Aleksander Prijovic often isolated, while youngsters like Lachie Wales and Dylan Wenzel-Halls haven't always delivered. They come up against a Phoenix team that they have never beaten since their first game in 2019, and last lost to the Wellington side 4-1. Regular season: 4th Head coach: Carl Veart First finals game: Elimination final v Central Coast Mariners Rounding out the top four is Adelaide United, who won just one game in their opening ten rounds, but managed to claw their way to points throughout the season, often with last-minute game-snatching winners. Only four of their games this campaign have been won by more than two goals, with several decided in the dying stages, but the ability to continue to push for goals in these high-pressure moments arguably make the Reds one of the teams to watch in the finals series, particularly as they come into it on a five-game winning streak. Under the stewardship of Carl Veart, Adelaide have also developed a dressing-room culture and fanbase that is one of the envies of the league. This season has seen the re-emergence of on-again off-again Socceroo Craig Goodwin, who has led Adelaide's attack with nine goals as well as seven assists, while experienced Spaniard Javi Lopez has been one of the league's best full-backs. But it's the kids who Adelaide fans are really excited about, especially 18-year-olds Mohamed Toure and Bernardo Oliveira - son of the former Brazilian great Cassio — as well as 16-year-old Nestory Irankunda, who has scored some of the league's most net-ripping goals coming off the bench. Regular season: 5th Head coach: Nick Montgomery First finals game: Elimination final v Adelaide United One point below Adelaide in fifth is Central Coast Mariners, a club revived under head coach Nick Montgomery and beginning to embrace their dazzling young players such as 17-year-old Garang Kuol, 20-year-old Max Balard, and 22-year-old Josh Nisbet. They enter finals on a hot-streak spear-headed by the genius signing of Scottish-Australian striker Jason Cummings, the club's top-scorer (10) despite joining in late January, as well as Brazilian attacker Moresche, who have given the Mariners both dimension and penetration in the final third. At the opposite end of the field, the Mariners have begun to plug the gaps that saw them topple down the foot of the ladder over the past several seasons. Gloveman Mark Birighitti has had one of his most outstanding club seasons to date in between the sticks, while the emergence of both Lewis Miller and Kye Rowles as dependable defenders has helped the club maintain a more acceptable defensive record than in years past. However, their young core may be to their detriment, as history shows success in ALM finals football trends towards the older, more experienced squads. Regular season: 6th Head coach: Ufuk Talay First finals game: Elimination final v Western United Finally, Wellington Phoenix — the league's only New Zealand club, who have been temporarily relocated to Wollongong over the past two seasons due to lockdowns — ended their scattered campaign in sixth spot after a final-day 2-1 loss that handed City the Premier's plate. Their presence in finals football is somewhat surprising given they have the leakiest defence in the league with 49 goals conceded in 26 games, including some whoppers like a 6-0 drubbing by City and a 5-0 thrashing by Central Coast, despite having one of the league's stand-out keepers in Oliver Sail. The Nix have also struggled in the final third, coming into finals with the fewest goals scored across the top six (34). The expected return of key players from injury should help in many respects, particularly midfielders Nicholas Pennington and Clayton Lewis, as well as winger Reno Piscopo and joint-top scorer Jaushua Sotirio. The Nix also have history on their side coming into their elimination final against Western tonight having won six of their eight games against the Melbourne club since 2019.

118,"Matildas Kennedy, Raso, and Kerr ready to go head-to-head in FA Cup final",sport,"  Matildas Alanna Kennedy, Hayley Raso, and Sam Kerr ready to go head-to-head as Manchester City face Chelsea in FA Cup final Alanna Kennedy will put her fear of flying to one side on Monday, travelling half-way around the world looking for family, sunny beaches, and better coffee. But before she gets home, the Matilda has to spoil Sunday night for her national team captain. That's when Kennedy will lace up for Manchester City in the Women's FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium and take on fellow Aussie Sam Kerr, whose two goals helped Chelsea win the trophy last year against Arsenal. Kerr is coming off another superb season with the Blues, winning her second consecutive Women's Super League title as well as another Golden Boot. Kennedy is also in fine form, recovering from a difficult start to her time in Manchester but lately settling into a back-line that has conceded just five goals in their last 14 matches, all of which they won. Not even a broken nose suffered playing for Australia against New Zealand in Canberra last month has stopped the 26-year-old. Kennedy realised her nose was broken when she saw herself on the big screen at GIO Stadium. ""I had a feeling,"" she told AAP. ""I heard and felt a big crack and tried to speak to a few people around me. ""They probably didn't want to scare me. When I saw myself on the screen I thought I'd have a look. It wasn't ideal, but it's all fixed now."" The Sydneysider wore a mask for a few matches, but the nose has now been straightened and she's free to try and combat Kerr without it. ""Sam is an amazing player who I've had the pleasure of playing with, so I obviously know a lot about her and I think that's helpful,"" she said. ""Her movement is very smart. She finds good areas off the shoulders of the defenders, on their blind side. ""She's a great finisher and the timing of her headers and the power and redirection she puts into them is a huge strength of hers. ""I've won a couple of finals against Sam in the W-League, and I've also won some with her. I love playing against her. I think she brings out the best in me. I'm looking forward to it."" Beyond Sunday's final, Kennedy is also looking forward to the 2023 Women's World Cup on home soil. ""I think it'll be huge,"" she said. ""The Matildas have grown so much over the last five or six years across Australia and the support has been amazing, but to bring the best tournament in the world for women's football to Australia and New Zealand will just be a huge eye-opener for young girls and boys playing football. ""We can't wait for it. It's obviously very rare that you get the opportunity to play in your home country at a World Cup. I feel really lucky."" Kennedy has never been to Wembley, but having played in an Olympic semi-final, a World Cup quarter-final, and Asian Cup final, the 27-year-old is ""excited"" rather than nervous. The Campbelltown-born Kennedy has played for five clubs in Australia, including City's Melbourne offshoot, two in the USA, as well as Tottenham Hotspur and City in England. Is she finally setting down roots? ""I feel City is a good fit for me,"" she said. ""It's the kind of football I've always wanted to play. ""I feel more like myself. You like to get comfortable and settle, and feel you can really grow somewhere. I feel like I'm on my way to doing that here and we'll see what the future holds for me at this club.""

119,Damien Hardwick 'upset' by criticism of Dustin Martin after Tigers' star's return,sport," Sport Damien Hardwick 'a little bit upset' by criticism of Dustin Martin after Richmond star's return Richmond coach Damien Hardwick has defended Dustin Martin after the returning star Tiger was criticised for not doing any media interviews after last weekend's win over Collingwood. Martin was playing his first game back after a six-week absence taken for personal reasons. Speaking to to Saturday Morning Sport on ABC Radio Melbourne, Hardwick said Martin has never been comfortable in a media setting, and was disappointed by some of the criticism. ""I was probably a little bit upset at a few people that made it more about them and less about Dustin,"" Hardwick said. ""He's just electric at what he does, but it doesn't mean that brilliance is going to transfer into a media performer. And he doesn't feel comfortable in that space, he doesn't feel comfortable sharing his life story. ""He's not really interested in providing a running commentary on his life and what it looks like and feels like to be Dustin Martin. That's not him. ""It's not an arrogance, it's just a sense of he likes being his own man. He's very insulated, he doesn't let a lot of people in."" Martin kicked two goals against the Magpies last week in a solid return to action, and Hardwick said the three-time Norm Smith medallist provides more than enough for the game with his play alone. ""At what stage do we say 'this guy has provided two and a half hours of entertainment, he basically lost a kidney last year. He gives a lot this guy'. ""And don't get me wrong, he gets paid a lot for what he does, but he provides an incredible service by the people paying their money to see two and a half hours of brilliance of Dustin Martin. ""At what stage is that enough? Do we really need two questions to sit there and provide the icing on the cake? Or are we just happy for Dustin to do what he does and provide the brilliance he does on a weekly basis? ""He will at some time sit down and speak, but that time isn't now."" Richmond will go into their round nine game against Hawthorn in the top eight and with improving form, and Hardwick said the return of their talisman gave the entire club a timely boost. ""To have him back last week was incredibly important, and it gave our whole club a lift,"" he said. ""He still has his good days and his bad days, but for him to just be there to play his game, it was enormous. ""You could see when he did kick that goal, every single player on the ground got to him. All our coaching staff were a little bit misty eyed in the coaches' box too ""It's great to see players come back from adversity, but it's just great to see the fans applaud such a player coming back as well. It was a really touching moment not only for Richmond but for the AFL.""

120,Phil Mickelson withdraws from PGA Championship after Saudi criticism,sport,"  Phil Mickelson withdraws from PGA Championship amid fallout from Saudi comments Phil Mickelson will not defend his PGA Championship title after stepping away from the game in February amid a backlash over comments he made about a Saudi-backed golf league. Mickelson had kept golf fans guessing about whether he would be at Southern Hills Country Club next week but the speculation ended when the PGA of America announced he would not be in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The 51-year-old American is just the third PGA champion not to defend his title — after Tiger Woods in 2008 and Ben Hogan in 1949, both of whom bowed out due to injury. ""We have just been informed that Phil Mickelson has withdrawn from the PGA Championship,"" the PGA of America said. ""Phil is the defending champion and currently eligible to be a PGA Life Member and we would have welcomed him to participate. ""We wish Phil and Amy the very best and look forward to his return to golf."" Mickelson's public image took a hit when the author of an unauthorised biography on the six-times major champion said the golfer told him he was willing to look past Saudi Arabia's human rights record to gain leverage with the PGA Tour. Mickelson later apologised for the comments, which he claimed were off the record, and then said he planned to take time away from the sport. Saudi Arabia's government has denied accusations of human rights abuses. Mickelson became golf's oldest major champion at last year's PGA Championship when, less than a month shy of turning 51, he held off Brooks Koepka and Louis Oosthuizen to triumph by two shots at Kiawah Island's Ocean Course. Last month, Mickelson filed for a release from the PGA Tour to play in the inaugural LIV Golf Invitational event, to be held from June 9 to 11 near London, and also registered for the PGA Championship and June 16-19 US Open. The PGA Tour on Tuesday rejected requests from several players, including Mickelson, for clearance to play the LIV opener.

121,"Peter Bol, Jess Hull fly at Diamond League international meet",sport,"  Australians Peter Bol and Jess Hull fly at Diamond League international athletics meet in Qatar Peter Bol and Jess Hull are smiling but Stewart McSweyn can only grimace following Australia's middle-distance luminaries suffering dramatically contrasting fortunes in Doha's season-opening Diamond League meet. On a wild and windy Friday night in the Qatar capital, Olympic finalist Bol delivered the stand-out Australian performance in a ""crazy"" race, excited to earn his first-ever runners-up finish in a Diamond League 800 metres. Jess Hull was also celebrating after earning a top-three position in a high-quality 3,000 metres. But for middle-distance master McSweyn, who has had a torrid time after struggling with long COVID, it proved a wretched high-profile return. He suffered a strained glute after the first 100 metres of his 1,500m and struggled on to traipse home the last of the 11 finishers. Bol, fourth at last year's Olympics, signalled he would again be a force to be reckoned with in a world championship year as he delivered a powerful late kick in the two-lap event. The 28-year-old Khartoum-born star proved the fastest finisher after a cagey race, roaring past Canadian Marco Arop and Briton Dan Rowden to finish second in 1 minute, 49.35 seconds. But the field was caught napping by Kenya's exceptional teenage world indoor silver medallist Noah Kibet, who took off on the final bend and maintained his form to win comfortably in 1:49.08. ""Today was a bit of a crazy race with the wind!"" Bol said. ""But I'm really happy with how it worked out. The time doesn't really matter to me, but what does matter is that it's my first placing in a Diamond League. ""I hope [there are] a few more to come. I'm really happy with it."" National record holder Hull also enjoyed her best Diamond League outing, coming third in the 3,000m ahead of Turkey's Yasemin Can and Ethiopian Girmawit Gebrzihair in 8:40.97. But way up ahead, there was a tremendous duel between two runaway leaders, with former Olympic 800m silver medallist Francine Niyonsaba, of Burundi setting a world-leading 8:37.70 while pipping Kenyan Olympic 1,500m champ Faith Kipyegon (8:38.05). ""Going forward, my plan is to focus on the 1,500 this season, but I believe this is a good start,"" Hull said. McSweyn's trouble struck early in the metric mile as he struggled to the line in a woeful 3:48.67. It was left to Matt Ramsden to fly the Australian flag in sixth (3:38.83), as Kenya's Abel Kipsang raced to victory. On a night when the men's pole vault was cancelled after a handful of attempts because high winds made it too dangerous, the usually excellent Australian Brandon Starc could not even clear his gentle opening 2.16m in the high jump. The international highlight of the night was Noah Lyles holding off strong-finishing US compatriot Fred Kerley to win the 200m in a wind-assisted 19.72 seconds. Olympic champ Andre de Grasse was fourth. The men's javelin throwers enjoyed the wind at their backs too, with Grenada's 2019 Doha world champion Anderson Peters landing a 93.07m monster, making him the fifth-longest thrower since the javelin weight was changed. The shock of the evening was Bahamian double Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo finishing third in the 400m as Tokyo silver medallist Marileidy Paulino, of the Dominican Republic, won in 51.20sec.

123,"Nitschke to take an 'if it's not broke, don't fix it' approach, in new era for Australian women's cricket team",sport," Sport Shelley Nitschke keen to carry on Matthew Mott's legacy in new era for Australian women's cricket team It was announced this week that Matthew Mott would leave his long-standing role with the national women's side to take charge of England's men's white-ball prospects. The news meant assistant Shelley Nitschke will take over for the interim, as the world's number one side prepares to head to the UK for a T20 International tri-series and the Commonwealth Games in July. The former Australian all-rounder has been working under Mott for the past four years and is the current coach of 2021 Women's Big Bash champions, the Perth Scorchers. During an international career that spanned from 2004 to 2011, Nitschke represented Australia at four World Cups and won trophies in both the 50-over (2005) and T20 (2010) formats. Nitschke was named the ICC Women's Cricketer of the Year in 2010 and won the Belinda Clark Award as Australia's best women's cricketer four years in a row, from 2009 through to 2012. Speaking with the ABC on the morning of the announcement of the team's Commonwealth Games squad, Nitschke said she was overjoyed by the opportunity. ""I'm just really grateful to have been given the opportunity, to be honest. Obviously it's an amazing team and it's been awesome to be a part of their journey over the last four years,"" she said. ""I never really envisaged as a player that I would go into coaching and it's a very different game now, so it's been wonderful to stay part of the game as it's gone through such a big transition. ""To get the chance to lead this side, I'm really quite honoured."" Mott's legacy leaves some huge shoes for Nitschke to fill in the coming months, after the team achieved a world record winning streak in ODI cricket (26 straight), clinched three World Cup titles, and have had a tight hold on the Women's Ashes trophy under his tenure. After seven years in charge, his departure makes way for a new era for the Australian team, with the opportunity to carry on down the same track or take a new path. Nitschke said it is more likely to be the former than the latter, given all she has learnt from Mott during their time together. ""We're certainly going to miss his nice and relaxed approach, the game plan he's set up and the relationships that he's built … I'd like to think that I can carry on what he's created and at times, add my spin on it, but I certainly think he's set everything up really well for us to have sustained success,"" she said. ""You won't be seeing any shake-ups, it's more of an element of 'if it's not broke, don't fix it', and I think one of the huge successes of this team is the way the playing group drives their values. ""There are certainly things that I'll put my spin on and do a little bit differently as a person, and we'll reassess things as we go, but there certainly won't be major changes."" One thing the team have never had the opportunity to do is to win a gold medal, but with women's T20 cricket being added to the schedule at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, the team have set their sights on another accolade. Nitschke said the sport's introduction at the Games would help take it even further on the world stage and that she was looking forward to working alongside the other national teams in the Australian Commonwealth Games group. ""It's really exciting for us, it's something completely different. It's obviously going to get the global game pushed forward some more for people to see,"" Nitschke said. ""To be over there with other athletes and Australian teams is something really new to us, and the group is really excited about it, we can't wait."" Mott is not only well-respected in the cricket community, but is well-liked for his happy-go-lucky personality, with his laid-back and warm approach as a coach. All-rounder Ash Gardner said Nitschke's personality was pretty similar, which should help the transition period under her watch go smoothly. ""She's great to have around,"" Gardner said. ""Shelley is always up for a joke, which is something that keeps you grounded, but she's not afraid to tell you the truths that you may not want to hear, and sometimes as players you need that. ""Even when you look at her playing record, she was so good back in her day … she didn't win all the Belinda Clarks and ICC medals for no reason."" The pair share a special bond after a tumultuous trip to India in 2016 with the national Indigenous women's team, where Nitschke was coach and Gardner was the captain. Nitschke is the likely front-runner for the permanent role and if the team are able to bring home gold, that might just seal the deal. But Gardner said the opening is likely to draw the attention of some big-name candidates. ""I would assume that both assistants, Ben Sawyer – who I've had a lot to do with at the Sixers and actually coached me in the U18s – as well as Nitschke would fill the job nicely,"" she said. ""In saying that, I know how much interest this job will get, considering we've been one of the most successful Australian sides in history, so I think that's going to attract some exciting options and I'm keen to see who we get. ""If it was to end up being Shelley or Ben, I know none of us will be complaining."" The Australian women's team will play the T20 international tri-series against Pakistan and Ireland from July 16, before making the trip to Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games where they'll begin their campaign on July 29.

124,Cricket Australia names its women's Commonwealth Games squad,sport," Sport Cricket Australia announces Commonwealth Games women's cricket squad Cricket Australia has this morning announced its 15-player women's squad heading to the United Kingdom in July, for the T20 International Tri-Series in Northern Ireland and the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. The side remains unchanged after its ICC World Cup victory last month, as Amanda-Jade Wellington and Grace Harris retain their places in the squad, which features five spinners and five seam bowlers. Superstar all-rounder Ellyse Perry is expected to play purely as a batter on the trip at this stage, as she recovers from a stress fracture in her lower back. Perry missed two matches at the World Cup with soreness, before making a return for the final against England in the same capacity. Fans will be excited to see Alyssa Healy back in action, after the explosive batter was named as both player of the final and the tournament for her 170 runs in the decider and 509 total runs for the tournament. Alongside Rachael Haynes, Australia's opening pair were the top two run scorers at the 50-over World Cup, amassing more than 1,000 runs between them. But the switch to the shorter format will now see Beth Mooney re-join Healy at the top of the order. The trip will also mark a changing of the guard for the Australian coaching staff, with former all-rounder Shelley Nitchske taking over as the interim head coach after Matthew Mott's departure to coach England's men's limited-overs teams. Women's T20 cricket is due to make its debut at the Games on July 29 and the top-ranked Australian team is set to face India, Barbados and Pakistan in Group A. The top two countries in each group will then progress to the semi-finals, playing for a spot in the bronze and gold medal matches held on August 7. As the current holders of both the one-day and T20 World Cup, with recent multi-format series victories against India (October 2021) and England (February 2022), Australia will be the favourites to challenge for gold. The side will also get a sneak preview of what to expect from Pakistan in the weeks leading up to the Games when they face the seventh-ranked side alongside Ireland in a T20 tri-series in Northern Ireland. Each team will play each other twice in the series spanning from July 16-23 at the Bready Cricket Club in Derry. Australia's head of performance and national selector Shawn Flegler said the tri-series should help the team adjust to the northern hemisphere conditions. ""This series is an important part of the team's preparation for the Games, and we are grateful for the support from Commonwealth Games Australia that has allowed this to happen,"" Flegler said. ""It's exciting to see the women's game feature at the Commonwealth Games for the first time, it's going to be a historic occasion and one we're all looking forward to. ""The two series also present Shelley Nitschke with a great opportunity to lead the side. We're in a fortunate position to have some world-class coaches in our system, with both Shelley and assistant coach Ben Sawyer contributing to the team's success over the last few years."" The team's physiotherapist, Kate Beerworth, said injured bowlers Tayla Vlaeminck and Georgia Wareham were progressing well in their rehab, but neither would feature at the Games. Vlaeminck has been working with The Australian Ballet to try and speed up her return to play.

125,'I leave with a heavy heart': Aussie Matthew Mott appointed England cricket coach,sport," Sport Australia women's cricket mentor Matthew Mott becomes England men's ODI and T20 coach Australia's all-conquering women's cricket team is searching for a new coach with Matthew Mott accepting an offer to lead England men's white-ball side. Mott will join Brendon McCullum in trying to turn around the flagging fortunes of England after the former New Zealand star was last week appointed Test coach. His current assistant and former star all-rounder Shelley Nitschke will coach Australia for a tri-series in Northern Ireland and the Commonwealth Games campaign in Birmingham. Mott has coached Australia since 2015, with the team close to unstoppable since being unexpectedly knocked out in the 2017 ODI World Cup semi-finals. Australia has had an unprecedented period ranked number one across the T20 and 50-over formats and also set a new world record by winning 26-straight ODIs. Australia's latest Cricket World Cup is a triumph all on its own, but it also exorcises demons that have followed this side for five years. ""I feel honoured to have been a part of such an amazing group of people over the last seven years,"" the 48-year-old said. ""I leave with a heavy heart but with so many wonderful memories. ""The on-field success is well-documented but it's the lifelong friendships that I've formed that resonate most with me. ""I am very proud to have been part of a sport that has been able to endure the last couple of years and come through it with an even brighter future. ""This playing group is led magnificently by a number of players, including [captain] Meg [Lanning] and Rach [Haynes], who have together helped forge a culture which will thrive for many years to come. ""I wish the team all the best and look forward to seeing them grow what's become an incredible legacy."" While in negotiations with England about the vacant position, Mott was hit with the tragic death of ""great mate"" Andrew Symonds. ""The support of his beautiful family and close friends in the coming days is going to be vitally important so I respectfully request for some time to process his passing and the immense loss before making any further comment,"" Mott said. Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley paid tribute to Mott's leadership of the women's team. ""Under Matthew's leadership, the team has claimed every major trophy on offer and importantly, has inspired kids across the country to pick up a bat and ball,"" Hockley said. ""He should be proud of the legacy he's helped create with our women's team.

126,Katey Martin ends NZ cricket's longest international career,sport,"  New Zealand wicketkeeper Katey Martin retires after 19 years as a White Fern New Zealand cricket's longest international career is over, with Katey Martin hanging up her gloves after 19 years as a White Fern. The indefatigable Otago wicketkeeper, who announced her retirement on Wednesday, was first picked for international duty in 2003. ""Cricket really has given me my life,"" she said. ""From leaving Dunedin as a youngster to attend the NZC [New Zealand Cricket] Academy in Christchurch, to travelling the world as a White Fern and representing my country, it's been a dream come true."" Martin, 37, leaves the game after 103 ODIs and 169 domestic one-dayers, a record for either men or women. She was first selected for international duty in a Test against India in 2003.

127,"AFL Round-Up: Demons' month of tests arrive, Tigers have that 2019 feeling",sport," Sport AFL Round-Up: Melbourne's month of tests arrive, Richmond have that 2019 feeling After 10 weeks of action the 2022 season has reached somewhat of a fork in the road, and some flag-chasing teams are about to face their biggest tests yet. Welcome to the AFL Round-Up, where we digest the week that was. You can count on one hand the amount of times the Demons have been genuinely challenged so far in 2022. Most of them have been brief charges that lasted little over a quarter and were promptly nipped in the bud, like from the Western Bulldogs on the season's opening night, or Essendon's last quarter at the MCG in round three. St Kilda probably offered up the most hearty four-quarter effort a few weeks ago and still lost by 38 points. Coming off back-to-back games against the league's worst teams — North Melbourne were gallant on Saturday arvo but still sufficiently outclassed — the time feels right for Melbourne to start facing some serious heat. The Dees' next four games sit around their round-14 bye, and come against Fremantle, Sydney, Collingwood and Brisbane. In the Dockers and Lions you have top-four fancies and teams who have at times looked like genuine threats to the Demons' throne, and in the Swans and Pies two unpredictable sides whose attacking best will threaten the Melbourne defence more than most others. The caveat is that all four of those games will be played at the MCG, but in a month's time a final verdict on just how far ahead of the pack Melbourne are will be reached. In all likelihood, this stretch will only solidify their dominance. But there's a pretty damn interesting season brewing underneath them, and the chasing pack have been biding their time, waiting for a shot at the king. Dion Prestia can sniff it. He told ABC Sport after Richmond's win over Essendon that the whiffs of 2019 are only getting stronger around Punt Road. Prestia pointed out the Tigers' record at the bye in that year — 7-6 at 91.99 per cent, and outside the top eight — and the home-stretch surge that took them to the second of their three flags. It's true the Tigers are hot right now, riding a four-game winning streak and playing football instantly recognisable as Richmond-like. But all four of those wins have come over sides unlikely to play finals this season. Much like Melbourne, the next four weeks for Richmond will be illustrative. Sydney at the SCG, before Port Adelaide, Carlton and Geelong at the MCG is the task before them. For Prestia's vibes to be proven right, they need to win all four of them. But that's not beyond Richmond in a competition that, aside from Melbourne at the top and some battlers at the bottom, is remarkably even. For the next few weeks at least, Richmond remain on top of the watchlist. The Round-Up has been a very pro-Hawk space this season, and yet again Sam Mitchell's men proved why. Hawthorn play attacking, uncompromising footy no matter the opposition, and have now another massive scalp in the bag in the Lions. The margin may have flattered St Kilda slightly, but they were good value for their win in Adelaide. Beating the Crows down there is no walk in the park anymore, so this win is a serious feather in the Saints' cap. Carlton are the best watch in the league right now, largely because they are so wildly unpredictable. It might not be easy on the hearts of Blues fans, but it's a hell of a good time for the rest of us. Geelong's win over Port Adelaide was hardly a classic, but Jeremy Cameron's boundary-line barrel after the 3QT siren means nobody inside Kardinia Park will soon forget it. Every bit as good as Mitch Duncan's last year. This coaching caper is a walk in the park for Mark McVeigh. Unfortunately for him and the Giants, they won't get to play West Coast every week — and coughing up 86 points to the Eagles is a bit of a worry too. Freo must be cursing La Niña. Their last two games have been played in the wet, and on both occasions they have failed to find a way to score. The Dockers' excellent season has hit its first major speed bump, and the Demons, Lions and Hawks await before the bye. The Bulldogs won on Saturday by finding a way to negate Jarrod Witts's influence and keeping the midfield battle scrappy. The Suns deserve credit for running it all the way to the wire, but the game was never really on their terms. Here we take stock of who is leading the race for the season's individual awards. The Rising Star battle is getting interesting, and it's a couple of mature-age players who deserve to be leading the way right now. We've had Nic Martin in front for the last few weeks, and he'll stay there for now, but his closest challenger is now clearly Jai Newcombe. The draft class of 2021 is having a quiet few weeks, though Ben Hobbs is worthy of a mention as his career starts to really warm up. It's hard to believe it's taken this long for Jeremy Howe to appear in this section, but his grab in the wet against Freo is our mark of the week. It's right up there for the year too, but for now Cam Zurhaar's lead remains. And for the hell of it, Jeremy Cameron's torp can be goal of the week, just so we can watch it again. Not quite enough to knock Ed Langdon off the top of the leaderboard though.

128,Hawthorn stuns Brisbane in Tasmania thriller,sport," Sport AFL ScoreCentre: Hawthorn stuns Brisbane in Launceston. Collingwood, GWS record wins Hawthorn have overturned a big margin to snap their four-match AFL losing streak with a stunning five-point upset of Brisbane. The Hawks looked gone when they conceded four consecutive goals out of the half-time break and trailed by 22 points midway through the third term. But with returning star Tom Mitchell (36 disposals) and young gun Jai Newcombe (27) influential in the middle, they surged home to win 18.9 (117) to 17.10 (112) on Sunday. It was the Hawks' first victory since Easter Monday and the highest score Brisbane have conceded this season, coming in just their second loss of the campaign. There was one concern for Hawthorn, when ruckman Max Lynch was taken from the field in the dying stages after an accidental clash of heads with Darcy Fort. The Hawks' can ill-afford to lose another ruckman, with Ben McEvoy (neck) and Ned Reeves (shoulder) already sidelined. In an epic arm wrestle in Launceston, the lead changed hands nine times, including five times during a see-sawing final term. Impressive Brisbane youngster Jaxon Prior put his side in front from one of many soft free kicks paid throughout the day before Mitch Lewis replied almost instantly to snatch back the lead for the last time. Hawthorn kicked three straight goals to break clear in a match-winning burst as the Lions lost Hugh McCluggage to a hamstring injury. Lewis stood tall against a Brisbane defence that sorely missed Marcus Adams, who was out through virus protocols. Key forward Lewis kicked four goals, with Chad Wingard (three), Sam Butler and Dylan Moore (both two) also contributing. Stand-in Hawks captain James Sicily kept Brisbane spearhead Eric Hipwood quiet. Charlie Cameron kicked 3.3 for the Lions and could've given them a sniff with just enough time remaining. But his dribbled shot from the boundary missed with teammates appealing for a pass in the corridor. Dayne Zorko's goal put Brisbane back within a kick with just two seconds left on the clock. Prior finished with three goals in an impressive display and Lincoln McCarthy kicked two, the first in each half. Jarryd Lyons (32 disposals) and Daniel Rich (33) were among the Lions best, while Brownlow Medal fancy Lachie Neale started strongly but drifted out of the game, finishing with 25 and a goal. Hawthorn had a 36-27 free-kick advantage in a game that featured a raft of soft decisions by the trio of whistle-happy umpires. AAP Collingwood's teenage supersub Oliver Henry has amplified Fremantle's wet-weather worries as the Magpies bucked the odds to post a 36-point AFL win at Perth stadium. The Dockers struggled for fluency in last week's 36-point loss to Gold Coast in the wet, and a pre-match downpour on Sunday ensured another slippery affair. The Magpies were dealt a blow midway through the second quarter when ruckman Mason Cox was subbed off with a finger injury. But his replacement Henry became an unlikely hero, with the 19-year-old booting four second-half goals to help propel Collingwood to the 12.8 (80) to 6.8 (44) victory. Will Hoskin-Elliott, Brody Mihocek and emerging star Jack Ginnivan shared the load up forward with two goals apiece, with Henry dominating after half-time. Ginnivan earned the ire of Fremantle fans in the final term when he outmarked Brennan Cox and celebrated in front of the Dockers' faithful while he strolled in to kick the easiest of goals. The win improved Collingwood's record to 5-5 ahead of next Sunday's MCG blockbuster against arch rivals Carlton. Fremantle started the season with a stunning 7-1 record, but back-to-back losses in the wet have raised serious questions about whether their game plan can hold up in slippery conditions. Big splashes of water were seen whenever a player hit the turf early in Sunday's match. Collingwood forward Jamie Elliott almost took a mark-of-the-year contender in the first quarter, while Nathan Murphy was forced off briefly for treatment after being crunched by Andrew Brayshaw. Jordan De Goey's class ensured scores were tied at quarter time, and the Magpies pulled clear in the second quarter on the back of three unanswered goals. Hoskin Elliott's pack mark and goal early in the third term set alarm bells ringing for Fremantle, but a clever snap from Michael Walters in the opening minutes of the last quarter saw the Dockers close the margin back to 16 points. Henry starred from that point on, booting three goals in the last term to kill off Fremantle's resistance. Will Brodie (36 disposals, 11 clearances) and David Mundy (35 possessions) led the way for Fremantle. Collingwood lost the possession count by 49 and contested possessions by 23. But their efficiency with the ball meant they won the inside 50m count 60-46, allowing their forwards to kick a winning score. AAP Greater Western Sydney have started their new era under Mark McVeigh in style with a 52-point thumping of West Coast at Giants Stadium. The Giants outclassed the undermanned Eagles from the opening bounce to give McVeigh the best possible start as interim coach with a 21.12 (138) to 13.8 (86) victory on Sunday. The Eagles will also be sweating on the fitness of Luke Shuey after their captain was substituted out of the match in the final term. Both teams were missing several stars, especially after the Giants made nine changes to their team from last week, but the hosts settled quicker with four unanswered goals in the opening nine minutes that set the tone for the match. The Giants went on to post their biggest first-half score since round 4, 2016 — and their second-highest ever — to lead 14.3 to 5.4 at the main break. The most identifiable change made by McVeigh and the coaching group that now includes his former Essendon teammates James Hird and Dean Solomon was to switch Harry Himmelberg from the forward line to defence. Himmelberg looked comfortable in the back line and enjoyed the freedom to launch some torpedoes when kicking in after behinds, with one long bomb in the second term flying beyond the centre circle. He was also able to add to the 17 goals he had already booted this season, after a 50m penalty on the wing set up a shot from the 50m arc that Himmelberg slotted. With Himmelberg pushed to the back line, Jarrod Brander spent more time forward in his third match for the Giants since being delisted by the Eagles at the end of last season. Brander finished with 16 disposals and a goal against the club that drafted him from the Giants Academy with a first-round pick in 2017. Co-captain Stephen Coniglio starred in an on ball role with 36 disposals at 92 per cent efficiency, while fellow co-captain Josh Kelly (29 disposals) continued his strong form in the Giants midfield. The Giants shared the goals around with youngster James Peatling kicking three majors and six players including Toby Greene and Jesse Hogan finishing with two. Tim Kelly (23 disposals) and Jack Redden (20) battled hard in the Eagles midfield and Alex Witherden (18) looked to provide some run out of defence. Andrew Gaff made a slow start on his return to the Eagles line-up with only five disposals in the first half before spending more time on ball to finish with 19 touches. The Giants face a tougher test when they take on Brisbane at the Gabba on Saturday while the Eagles will play the Western Bulldogs at home.

129,Richmond beats Essendon in spiteful contest in Dreamtime at the 'G,sport," Sport AFL ScoreCentre: Richmond beat Essendon in Dreamtime at the 'G, Essendon have taken another hit in their AFL season from hell, suffering a 32-point defeat to Richmond in a fiery clash on Saturday night. Dion Prestia (36 disposals) starred and Jack Riewoldt kicked four goals for the Tigers in their 11.14 (80) to 7.6 (48) win at the MCG. The match started with the traditional pre-match Dreamtime ceremony on the pitch, during which Richmond players paid tribute to their Indigenous stars, the whole team participating in the war cry. Between the sirens, Indigenous talents Shai Bolton and Maurice Rioli Jnr gave fitting contributions in the Dreamtime feature match, kicking two goals each. Liam Baker (30 disposals) and Daniel Rioli (26) continued their outstanding seasons and Robbie Tarrant stood tall in defence. Prestia received the Yiooken Award as best afield. But Kane Lambert was substituted out with hip soreness and Tom Lynch (hamstring) sat out the final quarter of a fourth consecutive win that firmed up Richmond's (6-4) spot in the top-eight. Put under a fierce blowtorch this week, Essendon needed to show more fight than in their meek round-nine surrender to Sydney. Ben Rutten's men repeatedly flew the flag in a fiery contest against the Tigers but never looked like being able to produce an upset win that could have sparked a turnaround in their campaign. The loss left them floundering near the foot of the ladder with a 2-8 record. And making matters worse, Mason Redman was reported for striking Prestia off the ball. Darcy Parish racked up 43 touches, including 19 contested possessions, in a losing cause but wasn't clean in his disposal by foot. Zach Merrett (33 disposals) and Redman (29) found plenty of the ball and youngster Ben Hobbs kicked two goals. Essendon great Matthew Lloyd led the chorus of criticism against his old club in recent days and would have been at least been pleased to see the Bombers show some aggression from the outset. Sam Draper led the response that followed Tom Lynch crashing into Matt Guelfi's back and Redman laid a ferocious tackle to pin Bolton holding the ball. It was one of 20 tackles laid by Essendon in the first quarter after they tallied just 30 for the entire game a week earlier. But for all the Bombers' endeavour, they coughed the ball up too easily and were outclassed by a far more efficient Richmond side that featured 18 premiership players. A run of five-straight Tigers goals either side of the first break gave them a lead they never relinquished. Richmond sewed up a comfortable, if not pretty, victory midway through the final term when Bolton kicked his second major and cheekily waved 'goodbye' to the Essendon cheer squad. AAP/ABC Max King was the difference as St Kilda kicked the final four goals to overrun a brave Adelaide and claim a 21-point AFL victory at Adelaide Oval. Saints spearhead King booted six goals straight while the Crows failed to make the most of their opportunities in front of goal as the Saints won 14.6 (90) to 9.15 (69) on Saturday night. King was the star throughout and well-supported by speedster Bradley Hill in his 200th match. The Saints' midfield, missing captain Jack Steele due to a shoulder injury, was made to battle deep into the final term before sealing the win, but Hill stepped up with 30 disposals and a team-high 568m gained. Hill's run-and-carry and clean kicking stood out in a scrappy contest and helped King do the damage closer to goal. Brad Crouch was also important in his second match against his former club, with a goal and 14 of his 31 disposals contested. Jack Sinclair was also prolific with 32 disposals. Ben Keays continued his strong form for the Crows with 27 disposals and Jordan Dawson was important with 22 touches and two goals but the lack of a focal point cost them. Brodie Smith was another of the Crows' best and finished with 28 disposals and 659m gained. It was a spirited opening from the Crows with Riley Thilthorpe looking lively and kicking an early goal in his first match since round one after a stint in the reserves and later on the sidelines with a knee injury. But the Crows weren't able to make the most of their 18-9 inside 50s and trailed 1.5 to 2.1 at the first change after King slotted his second goal just before quarter-time. The hosts continued their dogged efforts through the second term but again failed to capitalise on the scoreboard, and a 4.8 to 3.3 halftime lead was quickly erased by a goal to Tim Membrey and two more to King. The Crows' inaccuracy in front of goal ultimately left the door open for the Saints to make the late charge that now has them well-placed for finals with a 7-3 record. St Kilda will continue their chase for a top-four spot against North Melbourne next Sunday while Adelaide face Geelong at GMHBA Stadium on Saturday. AAP Melbourne have secured their 17th-straight AFL win, barely getting out of second-gear in accounting for an improved North Melbourne by 47 points. Last year's wooden spooners put in one of their best efforts of the season, even closing within six points midway through the third quarter, but the Demons (10-0) simply had too many weapons at Docklands on Saturday. After booting the last two goals of the third quarter to lead by 22 points at the final change, Melbourne, who have rebranded themselves as Narrm for Sir Doug Nicholls Round, ran out winners 14.16 (100) to 8.5 (53). Star midfielder Clayton Oliver was clearly the best player on the ground, grabbing a career-high 45 possessions — the second time this season he has passed the magical 40 mark in a game — and 13 clearances. After five weeks of uncompetitive performances that has shone the spotlight on coach David Noble, North fought hard until the Demons' weight of numbers — 74 inside-50s to 34 — eventually won out. Tom McDonald and Bayley Fritsch kicked three goals each for the Demons, as did Cameron Zurhaar for North. Melbourne's only concern was a suspected rib injury to winger Ed Langdon, who was on the end of a big Tarryn Thomas tackle in the first quarter. Langdon was subbed out of the match for small forward Toby Bedford. The Kangaroos' Curtis Taylor also suffered a rib injury and was replaced by Atu Bosenavulagi in the final term. Melbourne will host Fremantle in a top-four showdown at the MCG next Saturday, while the Kangaroos will be back at Docklands to face St Kilda on Sunday. The Demons now have the most consecutive wins any AFL team has racked up since St Kilda won the first 19 games of the 2009 season. They are just two wins away from equalling the historic club's greatest streak, set back in 1955-56. AAP Geelong have broken Port Adelaide's four-game AFL winning streak, withstanding a fierce early challenge to win easily by 35 points. The Cats kicked seven goals to two after half-time on Saturday at Kardinia Park and won 11.16 (82) to 7.5 (47). Geelong improved to 6-4 and won two in a row for the first time since round four. But Cats star Patrick Dangerfield was subbed out of the game in the last quarter with a tight calf. Tyson Stengle kicked three goals for the Cats in Indigenous round and defender Tom Stewart starred, while midfielder Cam Guthrie racked up 37 possessions, including 15 contested. Cats key forward Jeremy Cameron also kicked three goals, including a booming screw punt on three-quarter time that did a lot to decide the game. Port utility Dan Houston had 30 disposals and took 11 marks. After a scrappy opening, Port key forward Jeremy Finlayson fittingly kicked the first goal of the match in Sir Doug Nicholls Round. Finlayson, a distant relative of Sir Doug, goaled 17 minutes into the first quarter. The Cats kicked the last three majors of the term to lead by 11 points. Port briefly hit the front in the second quarter, but Geelong led by a point at the main break. The Cats surprisingly took no marks inside 50m before half-time, despite ideal conditions and an attack boasting Tom Hawkins, Cameron and Gary Rohan, who returned from injury for his first game of the season. But the Cats went up a gear in the third, kicking five goals to one. Finlayson had a very gettable shot on goal late in the term and kicked it out on the full. The Cats raced the ball down the other end and Stengle kicked his third. Cameron took a strong mark and kicked a massive goal with a screw punt from 50m on the three-quarter time siren to put another dagger through the Power. Tellingly, heading into the last quarter the Cats had 20 scoring shots to nine. AAP The Western Bulldogs have beaten a fast-finishing Gold Coast by 19 points to claim consecutive victories for the first time in 2022 and get their AFL season firmly back on track. Luke Beveridge's Bulldogs have struggled for consistency all season but in front of a buzzing crowd in Ballarat, snatched the ascendancy via four unanswered third-quarter goals, and never gave up their lead from there to prevail 15.16 (106) to 13.9 (87). Claiming back-to-back wins evens the inconsistent Bulldogs' ledger at 5-5 and sets the Suns back to 4-6. Marcus Bontempelli booted three clutch goals and had 24 disposals and Bailey Smith (34 disposals) continued his stellar season, while Ed Richards and Bailey Williams were influential at half-back and half-forward respectively. Aaron Naughton looked set to break the game open with three first-half goals but was quietened by Sam Collins in the second half. The Suns deserved plenty of credit for never giving up, especially after losing Rory Thompson to a second-quarter knee injury while they were also without Jy Farrar (concussion) after half time. It was only Thompson's third game back after missing three seasons through two knee reconstructions. Joel Jeffrey was brilliant, booting five goals, and was supported by Ben Ainsworth (three goals) while David Swallow worked hard in midfield. The Bulldogs drew first blood but the Suns got a foothold in the game when Farrar marked on the forward flank but Bulldogs youngster Buku Khamis came in late and high, giving away an immediate 50-metre penalty and subsequently, a goal. Bulldogs gun Naughton was ominous up forward, booting two first-quarter goals while Jeffrey kicked a pair, including one after the siren, to cut the quarter-time deficit to eight points. Naughton instinctively snapped his third early in the second term but Gold Coast stayed in the game via a clever finish from Ben Ainsworth, while Jeffrey added his third by intercepting a handball then snapping over his head. The third period proved a cagey affair until Josh Dunkley took a big grab and kicked truly, with 200-gamer Adam Treloar, Robbie McComb and Bontempelli extending the lead beyond five goals. Jeffrey stemmed the Suns' bleeding by snapping his fourth and the Suns fought back from there. The Bulldogs threatened to seal four points on multiple occasions, especially when Bontempelli booted his third from long range. But Gold Coast fought back time and time again in the final term, until McComb soccered his second with 37 seconds left, with Smith hammering home a wonderful goal on the final siren.

130,Relieved Blues hold off fast-finishing Swans to solidify top four spot,sport," Sport Carlton beat Sydney by 15 points as fast-finishing Swans give Blues a late scare Charlie Curnow has starred with six goals as Carlton survived a huge fightback to strengthen their grip on an AFL top-four spot with a 15-point win over Sydney. The Blues prevailed 15.12 (102) to 13.9 (87) at Docklands Stadium on Friday night in a contest between fourth and fifth on the ladder, sending a warning to the competition in the process. Despite injured spearhead Harry McKay's absence, their brutal scoring power was on full show in a nine-goal second quarter that broke the game open. But the Blues were forced to scrap as Sydney hit back, closing to within eight points late in the final term before Zac Fisher hacked through a steadying goal in time-on. Swans co-captain Josh Kennedy will face scrutiny over a high spoiling attempt on Sam Docherty, during which he tore his right hamstring. The clumsy effort split open Docherty's head, forcing the Blues defender off under the blood rule, and sparked a fierce melee as Carlton players rushed to remonstrate with Kennedy. He was sat on the ground nursing his injured leg and was eventually helped off the field by two trainers as jeers from Blues fans rained down from the stands. Curnow earned plaudits for a dazzling display in which he kicked five first-half goals and finished with the equal second-biggest haul of his 72-game career. The Blues' midfield was dominant in the first half, leading their side to a 89-58 advantage in contested possession, which was 161-137 in their favour at full-time. Sam Walsh (34 disposals), former Swans ball-winner George Hewett (32) and Patrick Cripps (19) were all influential, particularly before half-time, and Jacob Weitering was strong in defence opposed to Lance Franklin. Luke Parker (26 disposals), Isaac Heeney (24) and Callum Mills (22) helped drag Sydney back into the contest. Young tall Logan McDonald was a shining light in attack for the Swans, starting brightly and finishing with three goals, while Tom Papley also booted three majors for the visitors. Carlton laid just four tackles in the opening term but there were signs of the impending avalanche as they dominated contested possession (42-23). The home side cut Sydney's lead to one point with the final two goals of the first term, including one on the siren to Curnow. And the dam wall burst as the Blues piled on the first five goals of the second quarter before taking a 38-point advantage to the main break. Two Franklin goals helped spark Sydney during the third quarter as the midfield momentum shifted. Big marks from Weitering, Tom De Koning and Lachie Plowman in the final term helped Carlton hold the Swans at bay.

131,'These are player safety issues': NRL rebuke Bunnies concussion claim ,sport," Sport 'These are player safety issues': NRL defends handling of head injuries after Rabbitohs concussion criticism The NRL have rebuked claims Taane Milne was incorrectly ruled out of South Sydney's loss to Canberra after a head knock, telling coaches they are not qualified to question the league's independent doctors. Milne was deemed to have copped a category-one head knock in the Rabbitohs' loss to Canberra, and immediately ruled out of the match after showing concussion symptoms on-field. Afterwards, Souths coach Jason Demetriou claimed he would be speaking to the NRL over the incident, adamant that there had been nothing wrong with the winger. But at his weekly media briefing on Monday, Graham Annesley showed replays of Milne's head hitting the ground before he stumbled back to the Souths' line. The NRL's head of football also revealed Milne had failed his off-field HIA, meaning he would not have been allowed back on the field even if he was considered a category two. ""These are player safety issues. These are not issues to be dismissed by players, coaches or anyone else,"" Annesley said. ""For non-medically qualified people to say he was OK or that he could have come back on the field (is wrong). ""To be brutally honest, we can't be led by opinions of non-medically trained people or by the player himself. It's a medical diagnosis that takes place."" Annesley said he had not heard from Demetriou on Monday over the situation, with the Rabbitohs also losing Tevita Tatola to a head knock. The incident comes after coaches raised several issues over players being deemed category ones in the early stages of the season, immediately ruling them out of games. And while Annesley admitted they had potentially been too cautious in the early rounds upon the implementation of the independent doctor, he was adamant this was not the case with Milne. Cronulla bounces back from last week's loss to Canberra to defeat Gold Coast 25-18, while the Raiders celebrate their third win in a row after beating South Sydney 32-12 in Dubbo. ""We would be the first to admit that maybe in the opening two rounds while we settled the system down, maybe some calls made that were too safe,"" Annesley said. ""Maybe they went too far. But that's not the case on this incident. ""This is not a decision that has to be debated. ""It's a decision made by an independent medical practitioner who has observed signs that indicate a possible concussion. ""That decision is taken not in the best interest of the NRL… but in the best interest of the player."" Meanwhile Annesley again defended several key calls over the weekend, including Dane Gagai's no-try in Newcastle's loss to Brisbane and the Christian Tuipulotu high hit in Manly's defeat to Parramatta. He also remains adamant the decision to not call an obstruction before Selwyn Cobbo's try against the Knights was not a howler, and was open to interpretation as a 50-50 call.

132,Rising Warriors star to step away from rugby league at age 23 ,sport," Sport Warrior star Chanel Harris-Tavita to take hiatus from rugby league at age 23 Warriors playmaker Chanel Harris-Tavita never expected to make this decision but at the age of 23, he has chosen to take a hiatus from the NRL. ""I want to take a break from rugby league,"" he said. ""I've made the decision in the last couple of weeks. ""Over the last year, I haven't been enjoying it as much as I want to, even though being an NRL player was something I dreamed of as a kid."" He will leave the Warriors at the end of the 2022 NRL season and says his decision is not related to mental health. Arguably the most talented New Zealand playmaker to come through the Warriors since Shaun Johnson's arrival at NRL level in 2011, Harris-Tavita has it all. A nice step, a rock-solid defensive game and a left boot equal parts power and precision. But just 44 games into his NRL career, the playmaker has decided to put that on hold. ""I have felt guilty when I think about the decision I'm making,"" he said. ""There are plenty of kids out there that would love to be in my position. Stepping back from the game might look like I'm taking it all for granted. ""I just think it's the best decision for me. Each time I told a family member or friend, it was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. ""I was scared to say it out loud, let alone tell my family, friends, and teammates. Most of the people I told were shocked, but they were all very supportive, which I'm thankful for. ""I'm extremely grateful for the experiences I've had and the people I've worked with. ""Soon it'll be time for a change of scenery."" Harris-Tavita intends to use 2023 to travel and continue his newfound hobby of writing. He is still keen to represent Samoa or New Zealand at the Rugby League World Cup later this year. The playmaker says the pressure of coming off-contract this year was the catalyst for him to finally make his decision. The Warriors offered Harris-Tavita a new deal in the pre-season but he knocked them back and said he wanted to hold off, eager to prove his worth after two injury-affected years. But the delay was partly because he knew he was living a lie. ""I was trying to delay the contract decision,"" he said. ""Deep down, I knew I didn't want to sign another contract and I was trying to hide that feeling from everyone including myself. ""A couple of weeks ago, my manager was coming to Brisbane to negotiate my contract and I said to myself: 'Am I going to grow some balls and make this decision now or am I just going to keep everyone else happy?' ""Before that, I was practically lying to everyone about what I wanted to do."" After being part of the Warriors side which has been forced to live in Terrigal, Tamworth, the Gold Coast and now Brisbane over the last three years, Harris-Tavita hopes to finish this chapter of his NRL journey back in Auckland. ""It's been a long time coming,"" he added. ""Hopefully we can play some good footy and get a good turnout. ""Knowing there's an end in sight, I'm sure I'll appreciate each moment a little bit more.""

133,"Sharks return to winning ways, Rabbitohs fall to Raiders",sport," Sport Cronulla Sharks score 25-18 NRL win over Gold Coast as Canberra defeats South Sydney 32-12 Cronulla has returned to the winners' list by defeating Gold Coast 25-18 in wet conditions in Robina. In Sunday's earlier match in Dubbo, Canberra celebrated its third win in a row after beating South Sydney 32-12. Following an underwhelming move to fullback last weekend, Sharks captain Nicho Hynes returned to the number seven jersey in style, scoring a try and setting up another as the visitors ran in four tries to three. Hynes then iced the game after a Titans' fightback with a last-minute field goal. Former Australian rugby sevens international Lachie Miller, making his NRL debut at fullback for Cronulla, also shone in the wet. The Olympian ran for 201 metres, made 10 tackle busts and scored a sensational breakaway try as the Sharks moved to 7-4 for the season. A fortunate bounce from a Jayden Campbell bomb in the 53rd minute allowed the ball to fall into Miller's arms and the 27-year-old sprinted through a staggered Titans' line before streaking 70 metres to score. His moment capped a three-try burst at the start of the second half where the Sharks took control of a game that had been locked 6-6 at half-time following tries from Gold Coast forward Jarrod Wallace and Cronulla centre Connor Tracey. Hynes was central to the match-winning spell, finishing off a break by Ronaldo Mulitano in the 43rd minute to put his team ahead, before firing a wonderful pass in the 51st minute for Mulitano to dive over. A smart gather by Wallace from Toby Sexton's grubber with nine minutes to play allowed the Titans prop to score his second try of the night and gave the hosts' hope. Wallace and Sione Katoa then got into a scrap after the Titans forward took exception to the Cronulla winger's treatment of AJ Brimson. From the resulting penalty against the Sharks, Masters scored to give the Titans a chance of an unlikely comeback before Hynes's ice-cool field goal conversion sealed the two competition points. Canberra stalwart Josh Papalii has marked his 250th NRL match with a dominant display, as the Raiders stifled the Rabbitohs for a third straight win. The Raiders scored four first-half tries in racing to a 20-0 lead, before completing a comfortable win. The result breathes life into the Raiders' season, as they are now 5-6 after their campaign had earlier looked shaky, while the Rabbitohs boast that same record after losing three of their last five matches. Fittingly, prop Papalii's made an early impact in his milestone match by powering over for a trademark try, shortly after returning star Jack Wighton had created an opener for winger Nick Cotric. The Raiders' forwards looked hungry early and delivered plenty of big hits as they took control through the middle, with a huge goal-line shot from Papalii denying Liam Knight points at 8-0. They again struck through the middle when hooker Tom Starling put a try on a platter for Hudson Young, before an electrifying team move saw a Corey Horsburgh flick pass create a line break that let Seb Kris cross to cap an outstanding half at 20-0. Any chance of a patented Raiders fade out seemed put to bed early in the second half when a Jordan Rapana flick put Matt Timoko through, although the Rabbitohs finally got on the board on 52 minutes when hooker Damian Cook broke three tackles and scored for 24-6. But Canberra withstood the surge and sealed the win through star youngster Xavier Savage, who flashed his pace and sliced through the Rabbitohs' line for his first try of the season. Papalii ran for 116 metres to go with eight tackle busts and his try. It was a lamentable display from the Rabbitohs, who completed just 61 per cent of their first-half sets and allowed a staggering 30 tackle breaks in that period. They will end the round eighth on the table but teams are queuing up to remove them from the finals spots, with Manly, St George Illawarra and Canberra all also on five wins.

134,"Panthers beat Roosters to extend lead at top of ladder, Storm humbled by Cowboys ",sport," Sport NRL premier Penrith defeats Sydney Roosters 32-12 after North Queensland thrashes Melbourne Storm 36-6 Jarome Luai has sent a clear message ahead of State of Origin by starring in Penrith's 32-12 win over the Sydney Roosters at the SCG. In Saturday's earlier matches, North Queensland thrashed the Melbourne Storm 36-6 in Townsville, St George Illawarra got past the Warriors 24-18 at Kogarah. With NSW coach Brad Fittler looking set to lose superstar Tom Trbojevic for the season, he would at least have taken some joy in Luai's performance against the Roosters. The Panthers five-eighth scored two tries, forced two drop-outs, busted four tackles, had three offloads and broke the line once in his second-last hit-out before Origin I on June 8. Teammate Stephen Crichton boosted his case for one of NSW's two vacant centre spots, scoring a length-of-the-field try to put the game to bed in the second half. It came as the defending premiers backed up their 32-6 flogging of an understrength Storm last week with a domination of the Roosters. The win puts the Panthers four points clear at the top of the ladder, a handy buffer they will welcome given the amount of players they will have in Origin. The Roosters could lose a player more immediately, with prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves on report for a high tackle and sin-binned for dissent. The Roosters veteran clocked James Fisher-Harris high as he crossed late, and then twice swore when speaking to referee Gerard Sutton when informed it would be a possible eight-point try. The incident highlighted a sorry night for Trent Robinson's team, who desperately missed the injured Victor Radley's direct running in attack as they often went sideways in their limited time with good ball. That issue was exemplified by the form of Isaah Yeo in the Penrith line up, who has quickly become the competition's best lock. Yeo was influential in Penrith's first try, taking the ball to the line and putting Scott Sorensen through a gap before Luai loomed up in support play. Luai's second came four minutes later when the Panthers ran it on the last, with he and Cleary combining before the five-eighth spotted a gap when Luke Keary slipped over in defence. The five-eighth also played a lesser role in the Panthers' next try, forcing a line drop-out to give his team one last set before halftime. They took full advantage, with Api Koroisau going over from dummy-half when the Roosters line rushed out expecting a Cleary field goal attempt. The Roosters in comparison could not take their chances when it mattered most. The hosts had the bulk of the ball in the 20 minutes after half-time but emerged from it even further behind when Crichton marked a Keary kick and went 95 metres to score. And while James Tedesco and Paul Momirovksi crossed for tries late in the second half, they too often lacked any real punch in attack, posing too few questions for the Panthers. Injuries to Jason Taumalolo and Kyle Feldt have taken some gloss from North Queensland's thumping of the Storm in front of a sellout crowd in Townsville. The Cowboys were staring down 12 straight losses to Craig Bellamy's side, with their last win coming in the 2015 preliminary final. But a six-tries-to-one performance on Saturday night marked their sixth win in a row and will have fans contemplating premiership aspirations as they went level on points with the second-placed Storm on the ladder,. Without stars Ryan Papenhuyzen and Jarome Hughes — and playing hooker Harry Grant in the halves — the Storm failed to fire in the second half as North Queensland dominated possession, territory and the intensity of the contest. Three tries in eight minutes early in the second half blew the Cowboys' 12-6 half-time buffer out to 30-6. Winger Murray Taulagi boosted his State of Origin selection push with an aerial put-down, fullback Scott Drinkwater found the line off a poor defensive read and young forward Jeremiah Nanai added two more tries to his season tally to be second in the competition with 10. The Cowboys could easily have won by more but Coen Hess was ruled for a double movement with his crash play and Melbourne winger Xavier Coates miraculously held up Taulagi over the line after a break. But in their glory came worry, with both co-captain Taumalolo and in-form winger Feldt suffering suspected knee injuries in the first half. Feldt's left leg was bent back awkwardly in a tackle. he was able to hobble off but must be in serious doubt to contend for the June 8 Origin series opener after he made his debut for Queensland in 2021. Taumalolo departed the field with a suspected right knee injury. The pair's injuries end a stellar run with injury for the club after coach Todd Payten was able to name the same starting side for four consecutive rounds. Taumalolo has led the NRL statistically in post-contact metres in a strong season start after suffering three separate hand injuries in season 2021. Feldt had scored seven tries in seven NRL appearances in 2022, with four coming in his last three games. In the first half, a brilliant solo effort by Tom Gilbert got the Cowboys on the board when he gathered the ball from a short goal-line drop out in the 12th minute and broke through the tackle of Marion Seve. Tom Dearden then found Reece Robson six minutes later from a quick play-the-ball for a try, before Felise Kaufusi finally cracked the Cowboys' defensive wall to score in the 32nd minute. That was the Storm's only try as North Queensland scored 30 or more points for a fifth consecutive game and Valentine Holmes kicked a perfect six from six conversions. St George Illawarra coach Anthony Griffin may have found the answer to his fullback dilemma after an electric display from Cody Ramsey helped the Dragons to their win over the Warriors. In front of 7,147 fans at a rain-soaked Jubilee Oval in Kogarah, Ramsey returned from a hamstring injury sustained in round three and took to the number one jumper with ease, scoring a try and setting up another. Griffin has toyed with Tyrell Sloan and Moses Mbye in that role earlier this year, but Ramsey looked every part an NRL fullback in a Dragons side who moved up to 10th on the ladder with the victory. The loss extends a month of woe for the Warriors, who have just one win in their last five under coach Nathan Brown. The home side began in the best possible fashion when Warriors halfback Shaun Johnson dropped the first kick-off of the afternoon, allowing Zac Lomax to touch down for the Red V on the very next set. But from this point it was the Warriors who had the upper hand. Johnson scored one of his own and sent up two aerial kicks for Dallin Watene-Zelezniak to bat back in field for Viliami Vailea to touch down. Ramsey was the only response the Dragons could offer as he burst into the line and slipped through some feeble Warriors defence to get his first try of the season. St George Illawarra trailed 14-12 at half-time and the Warriors looked set to pull away when Watene-Zelezniak crossed for his first try of the match. Fullback Reece Walsh's inaccuracy with the boot — he kicked one from four — proved to be the Warriors' undoing. They also lost star prop Addin Fonua-Blake to injury. It meant that when NRL debutant Michael Molo barged over the line from close range, the Dragons were level after Lomax converted. Ramsey had looked threatening whenever he brought the ball back from the backfield and a shift play to the Dragons' right edge allowed him to burst upfield in the play which broke the match open. Off the back of Ramsey's break, Lomax found his way over the line. He missed his conversion but added a penalty to make it 24-18 with 10 minutes to go. Despite a late scare from the Warriors in the final 30 seconds, Griffin's side held on for their fifth victory of the season.

135,Last-gasp penalty sees Blues down Brumbies,sport," Sport Last-minute penalty by Beauden Barrett sinks Brumbies in Super Rugby Pacific Beauden Barrett has slotted a field goal after the full-time siren for the Blues to steal a famous Super Rugby Pacific victory from the Brumbies in Canberra. The Blues' 21-19 win — a club record 12th straight — moved them further ahead on top of the ladder and likely relegated the Brumbies to third place with one round to play. The Brumbies, despite being camped in their own half defending for a bulk of the game, went ahead by one when Billy Pollard's try was cooly converted by Noah Lolesio with 70 seconds to play. They won the ball from the restart but lost possession and then watched as the visitors worked towards the posts, winning a penalty despite protests from the hosts. Under advantage, All Blacks playmaker Barrett calmly slotted the winner to end what had shaped as another feel-good story for Australian rugby. The Brumbies were furious at a penalty count 16-5 in the Blues' favour and at one point had made 95 tackles to the Blues' 38. ""We showed so much heart tonight; our backs were against the wall through the whole game,"" Brumbies captain Allan Alaalatoa said. ""I think some of those were our fault, but mate I reckon we'll get an apology later in the week, some videos [reviewing the penalties]. ""We defended our hearts out and I just don't feel we were getting the rub of the green … but we still managed to be up in the 79th minute."" With the Crusaders five points clear in second, the Brumbies look likely to miss the chance of a home semi-final, instead now needing a win over Moana Pasifika to secure third ahead of the surging Chiefs. ""That was almost Test match intensity with the young packs and see-saw nature of the game,"" Barrett said. ""When you come to Canberra you're up for a hell of a fight and we certainly got that."" The hosts had shot out of the blocks and led 7-0 after Pete Samu found a patch of grass to plant the ball in the second minute. But it was all the Blues after that, the Auckland outfit applying immense pressure as they threatened to reply. But it remained that way for almost 40 minutes, Roger Tuivasa-Sheck one of three would-be Blues scorers held up over the line and Kurt Ekland's try overruled for a knock-on. Folau Fainga'a and Darcy Swain were sin-binned as a 12-1 penalty count took its toll, but still they held firm until Barrett crossed for a try off a scrum after the half-time siren. Brumbies halfback Nic White broke that momentum with a sharp intercept at the resumption, running 80 metres before Fainga'a scored soon after from a maul to put the hosts back in front. Blues winger Caleb Clarke limped off with a hamstring injury but Karl Tu'inukuafe's try and another penalty gave the Blues a six-point lead inside the final five minutes. Pollard scored his late try off a trademark Brumbies lineout and maul and Lolesio snuck his conversion inside the right post to put them up by one with just over a minute to play, before the Blues pulled off their great escape.

136,"Brumbies, Waratahs face challenge of restoring self-belief as finals approach",sport," Sport Brumbies, NSW Waratahs face challenge of restoring self-belief ahead of Super Rugby Pacific finals In past seasons, all five Australian teams getting beaten by New Zealand opposition in a single weekend would have been cause for panic and ignited commentary pointing to the results as proof the game of rugby was dying in Australia. The five Australian sides did all lose to New Zealand teams last weekend, but there has been no panic so far and the ""doom and gloom"" commentary also hasn't surfaced. And why is that, you would be excused for wondering? For starters, reports of the game's death in Australia have always been exaggerated. Also, after a much-improved showing from Australian teams against New Zealand opposition in 2022 — and with already three times as many wins across the first four cross-over rounds this season as were recorded across the five weeks of Super Rugby trans-Tasman in 2021 — last weekend was quickly seen to be an anomaly. Of course, the results and the performances can all be better, and none of these opening paragraphs are trying to suggest that everything is awesome. Indeed, the Queensland Reds, Melbourne Rebels and Western Force remain desperate to convert a couple of close losses into their first cross-over wins. The Rebels and Force are facing mathematical tasks to break into the top eight, but the Reds are right in the thick of it and should still be eyeing off the fourth-place finish that still dangles in front of them, albeit with a few conditions applied. The return of back rowers Harry Wilson and Fraser McReight this week will certainly make a difference for the Reds as they host Moana Pasifika in Brisbane on Friday night, while the inclusion of James O'Connor — with a week under his belt after returning from injury — can only help as well. The Waratahs and Brumbies, though, have a slightly bigger challenge this weekend. The Waratahs face the Highlanders in Dunedin and the Brumbies host the Blues in a top-of-the-table clash at Canberra Stadium. Both Australian sides went down in close contests last weekend after a string of wins. The Brumbies may concede they made too many mistakes and gifted the Crusaders far too big a first-half lead in their 37-26 loss to the New Zealanders in Canberra last Friday night. The Waratahs will still be smarting from a second-half capitulation in which the Hurricanes did not take the lead for the first time in the match until the 75th minute. Both sides know they can beat New Zealand teams, as they have shown through their results this season. They need to recapture the belief and mindset that had served them quite well until round 13. And they need to do that because there are now only two games left before the finals series begins. ""We still want to go into the quarter-finals with momentum,"" Waratahs assistant coach Chris Whitaker said in Sydney on Tuesday. The Highlanders have vaulted into the top eight — at the expense of the Force and Rebels — on the back of three straight wins after a torrid run through the first 10 rounds. ""They [Highlanders] played good footy at the start of the year but lost a couple of games on the bell,"" Whitaker said. ""They're definitely dangerous … obviously with [All Blacks scrum-half] Aaron Smith steering them around the park. ""An Australian team hasn't won [in Dunedin] since 2014 so we know it's going to be a big battle."" The Waratahs have a few more players available for the clash with the Highlanders. Wallabies captain Michael Hooper is ready to go again after sitting out last weekend's loss to the Hurricanes at Leichhardt Oval, and Ned Hanigan is set to pull on a Waratahs jersey for the first time in nearly two years after returning from Japan. Similarly, the Brumbies will welcome fly half Noah Lolesio back to steer the team around again, with the Canberra-based side facing the first-placed Blues in a match that could have a major impact on the top two. ""Noah's been our first-choice 10 for a couple of years now, and it certainly gives the team a lift just having him fit and available,"" Brumbies coach Dan McKellar said on Wednesday The Brumbies played an uncharacteristic brand of rugby to trail the Crusaders 23-5 at half-time last Friday night, before clicking into gear and running in three tries to two in the second half to prove to themselves their game plan still worked. ""There was a lot to take out of it, in terms of belief and confidence,"" McKellar said of his side's strong second half once they had overcome their error-strewn first half against the Crusaders. Belief and confidence quickly emerge as key themes going into their huge clash with the Blues this weekend and they will remain so going forward into the finals. At this time of the season, most tweaks are mental. ""You look at the Rebels and their previous fortnight [before their three-point loss to the Chiefs last weekend], and it just sums up that so much of it is between the ears and mindset,"" McKellar said. ""We're certainly no different. We've got to be in the right place mentally to deliver what you need to deliver physically and obviously in these games you've got to be brutal and physical. ""Having that intent and that mindset is a massive part of that.""

137,"If rugby's played in heaven, these Fijian workers have the perfect hymn",sport,"  Fijian migrant workers bring rugby skills and song to Barossa Rams At the end of every rugby match played by the Barossa Rams rugby team, you might be able to hear a hymn. The hymn is an opportunity for the team's Fijian players to give thanks for the game they love, having recently joined the Rams in South Australia as part of the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme. Club president Fraser Vivian said the men, who work in Virginia picking tomatoes, arrived with plenty of skill and a love of rugby, but not much else. ""Two weeks before the season started, we had a little minibus roll up with 17 or 18 chaps piling out of the bus ready to take the field for a training session,"" Dr Vivian said. ""Very few of them had rugby boots, very few of them had much in the way of gear appropriate to train in, but they were super eager."" Fiji has won gold medals at the past two Olympics for Rugby 7s and is well known for producing world-class rugby players. Pacific Islands Council of SA chief executive Tukini Tavui says the game is important to the country. ""You just need to travel to Fiji and drive along the beach, or the sugarcane farms and they will be playing, sometimes they don't have balls, they often just use coconuts,"" he said. Mr Tuvui said having something to do on a recreational level helps the workers embed themselves into the local community. ""They've really made a name for themselves in the region, and also for rugby in South Australia and the support that they are getting from the local community has really helped them."" The Barossa Rams Rugby Club, which started as a senior men's team at the agricultural college in Roseworthy mainly made up of students from the eastern states and New Zealand, turns 45 this year. The team is now based in Lyndoch with junior, women's and men's sides. Dr Vivian said this year with the influx of international players the club had been able to form a second senior men's team. ""Almost instantly it doubled our senior men's players numbers, which was quite amazing to us."" Dr Vivian said the players had brought more to the club than just rugby skills. ""These chaps have amazing skills, but they are always there to lend a hand and always the first ones to help pack up at the end of training. ""These are the guys who come out and they play hard, but after each game, they sing a hymn to say thanks for the opportunity."" Mr Vivian said the Fijian players had added to the rugby community, particularly with their gentle personalities. ""Rugby might be known for, you know, some boisterous personalities, and some people who are hard-hitting and hard at life. But these boys off the field, they are gentle, smiling, amazing, and for want of a better word, beautiful people."" Viliame 'Bill' Nawaqatabu, who came to South Australia a few months ago, said he jumped at the chance to take part in a local rugby club. The tomato and cucumber picker plays back in Fiji. ""Some of my fellow Fijian friends came to our accommodation and asked us 'do you want to play?'"" He agreed to play straight away. ""I love playing for Barossa Rams. They were telling us a story that last year they always lose but now they always win."" Dr Vivian said the club was experiencing a lot more success this season. ""Obviously there is a very distinct advantage of having these guys around and we are finding that the results on the scoreboard are really quite amazing,"" he said. Win, lose or draw for the Barossa Rams, Dr Vivian says it's about sharing the love of rugby. ""I think it's really to me brought home how much of a community rugby can be,"" he said. ""We've always talked about rugby being the world game, being the game, they supposedly play in heaven. ""But it's a game where you can play and you can go anywhere in the world and find a rugby club and you've you found a bunch of brothers, and this really brings that home to us.""

138,Australia to host 2027 men's and 2029 women's Rugby World Cups,sport," Sport Australia confirmed as host of the men's 2027 and women's 2029 Rugby World Cups Australian Rugby has been given a huge boost by World Rugby, being named as host of the 2027 men's and 2029 women's Rugby World Cup tournaments. World Rugby confirmed the decision at a council meeting in Dublin on Thursday. ""This is an historic day for rugby in Australia,"" Rugby Australia Chairman Hamish McLennan said. ""We're beyond thrilled to be welcoming not one, but two Rugby World Cups to our shores."" Australia, two-time winners of the men's World Cup in 1991 and 1999, had previously been named as the preferred candidate to host both tournaments. It last hosted the men's World Cup in 2003, losing to England curtesy of an extra time Jonny Wilkinson drop goal in a dramatic Sydney final. None of the previous nine editions of the women's version of the tournament have been held in Australia. Rugby Australia estimates that hosting the back-to-back tournaments will provide a $1.8 billion injection into the local economy. Confirmation of the awarding of the World Cups will be a welcome boost to Rugby Australia, which has struggled financially in recent years. Rugby Australia needed a $14 million loan from World Rugby last year after pre-existing financial issues spiralled into a full-blown crisis because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rugby Australia terminated more than 40 per cent of staff at the start of the pandemic in 2020 — the culmination of a horror period in which former chief executive Raelene Castle left the organisation, it paid an out-of-court settlement to Israel Folau, and it faced a declining supporter base and allegations of mismanagement from former players. But with interest gathered from World Cups in 2027 and 2029, the Commonwealth Games in 2026 and the Brisbane Olympics in 2032, plus the financial windfall of a British and Irish Lions tour in 2025, Rugby Australia has the chance to recapture the imagination of the sporting public. ""Today is a significant moment in time for our game,"" McLennan said. ""It's a game-changer for rugby in this country, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalise and secure the future of the sport here and see the game we all love grow and thrive for years to come. ""We look forward to working together with World Rugby, our member unions and government partners over the coming years to ensure that we make the most of this opportunity and continue the resurgence of rugby in this country."" Two-time World Cup winning Wallaby Tim Horan wrote on social media that being awarded the two tournaments is ""the most significant moment in Australia rugby's history, since winning RWC 1991."". ""Hosting men's 2027 and women's 2029 RWC will grow participation and provide financial security for our game for generations,"" he wrote. World Rugby also confirmed that the men's and women's Rugby World Cups would head to the USA for the first time in 2031 and 2033 respectively. The USA will be just the second tier-two nation to host the men's global showpiece, after Japan in 2019. ""I speak for the rugby community and fans across the United States when I express our sincere gratitude to World Rugby for their trust and endorsement of our vision to grow this incredible sport exponentially across our country,"" USA Rugby boss Ross Young said. ""USA Rugby will now venture into a new era and ensure the sport's most treasured event is a springboard for creating lasting, sustainable enthusiasm and passion for rugby from coast to coast."" The USA won the first women's World Cup in 1991 and were beaten finalists in the next two competitions although their men have never reached the quarter finals. It was also confirmed that England will host the 2025 women's World Cup as World Rugby set its agenda for the next decade. World Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said the announcement provided ""unprecedented certainty and an unparalleled opportunity to accelerate the growth and impact of rugby globally"".

139,Manchester City's stunning comeback wins Premier League title before rival keeper hit in post-match pitch invasion ,sport,"  Manchester City claim Premier League title on dramatic final day of action Manchester City have produced a stunning come-from-behind victory to shatter Liverpool's hopes and once again be crowned champions of the English Premier League on a dramatic final day, with Ilkay Gundogan the hero. However, the joy in Manchester led to the latest in a series of pitch invasions — at various levels in English football — which have caused concerns for the safety of players and others. Elated fans rushed the pitch after Manchester City clinched a 3-2 win over Aston Villa to secure the club's fourth Premier League crown in five seasons. It nearly turned nasty, however, as Villa keeper Robin Olsen was hit by a fan in the melee as he tried to make his way off the ground. Manchester City later released a statement apologising to Olsen: ""Manchester City would like to sincerely apologise to Aston Villa goalkeeper Robin Olsen, who was assaulted after the final whistle at today's match when fans entered the pitch,"" the club said in the statement. ""The club has launched an immediate investigation and, once identified, the individual responsible will be issued with an indefinite stadium ban."" Going into their final match of the season with a one-point lead over the Reds, the equation had been simple for City: beat Aston Villa and become champions, but on the day it proved harder. City were down 1-0 at half-time after Matthew Cash scored for Villa, while Liverpool were level with Wolverhampton at 1-1 and level on the ladder with City on 90 points (but behind on goal difference) as the title race went into the final 45 minutes of the season. City's problems were then compounded when former Reds midfielder Philippe Coutinho, helping out the club he scored 41 goals for, doubled Villa's lead in the 67th minute. The goal was as simple as they come as Ollie Watkins headed on from a long Olsen goal kick, and the former Liverpool midfielder Coutinho produced a brilliant first touch to cut inside and then drilled the ball into the bottom corner. At the same time Liverpool were pressing against Wolves but couldn't find their moment as Anfield was on edge. With 15 minutes to go it seemed City might have blown their title chance until 5 minutes of play changed the complexion of the title race. First, Gundogan struck in the 76th minute as he headed in a Raheem Sterling cross to make it 2-1 to Villa. Then two minutes later Rodri levelled for City as the Spaniard side-footed an Oleksandr Zinchenko pull back into the net from outside the area. And then Gundogan struck again on 81 minutes as he tapped in a Kevin de Bruyne cross to give City a 3-2 lead with what would be the goal that sealed the title, despite Liverpool going on to defeat Wolves 3-1 after late goals to Mohamed Salah and Andrew Robertson. Gundogan himself was stunned with the comeback. ""It was an unbelievable game, I don't know what to say to be honest,"" he said. ""It's been fantastic, the last 20 minutes, scoring three goals, unbelievable. ""After going 2-0 down, the chances were very, very small. ""I think we had to do the simple things again in the best possible way and scoring the two goals in three minutes gave us the right lift. ""We are proud of ourselves today."" The title is City's fourth in five seasons but the first time that they have claimed the title at home. For Liverpool, it was a day of disappointment, the mood at Anfield different to the one of joy in Manchester but that could change next week when they take on Real Madrid in the Champions League final next weekend in Paris. ""The lads have given everything, so you can't have too many issues,"" Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson told Sky Sports. ""We've given absolutely everything all season, right until the last day, and in January we'd have bit your hand off to take it to the last day. ""We're a bit disappointed today. We've got to say congratulations to City, of course, and then focus on the match next week."" While not winning the title was difficult for Liverpool, it was a much worse day for Burnley, who after seven seasons in the top-flight will drop to The Championship. Needing a win to stay ahead of Leeds, Burnley fell to Newcastle 2-1, as Leeds managed a 2-1 victory over Brentford to secure another season in the Premier League.

140,Melbourne City to face Western United in ALM grand final,sport," Sport Melbourne City to face Western United in ALM grand final after defeating Adelaide United Jamie Maclaren sealed Melbourne City's 2-1 win over Adelaide United in extra time in the second leg of their A-League Men semi-final. City is now one win away from becoming the first team to complete consecutive A-League Men premiership-championship doubles. Maclaren's 92nd-minute goal capped off a dramatic second-leg comeback and tees up the first all-Victorian ALM decider against Western United at AAMI Park on Saturday. It will be City's third consecutive grand final appearance. Scores were locked at 0-0 after Wednesday's first leg in Adelaide and Zach Clough's wonderful 48th-minute dink put the Reds in front at AAMI Park, before Marco Tilio equalised in the 74th minute to take the game to extra time. It was City's first victory over a top-four team from 11 attempts this season. In just their third season, Western United will play off for the championship following their semi-final win over Melbourne Victory. The first half was largely defined by big saves from Adelaide goalkeeper Joe Gauci and City counterpart Tom Glover. Then, three minutes after half-time, Javi Lopez found Clough, who took a touch with his left foot then coolly chipped a looping, dipping volley over Glover's head. Adelaide almost doubled its lead in the 57th minute, when Kusini Yengi beat Curtis Good and attempted to finish from a tight angle, only for Connor Metcalfe to clear it over the bar. Patrick Kisnorbo turned to Tilio off the bench in the 58th minute and 16 minutes later, the Socceroo delivered. Andrew Nabbout floated in a cross and it went over the head of a leaping Mathew Leckie, but Tilio burst in at the back stick and headed home off the post. In the 84th minute, Tilio charged forward and let rip with a cracking long-range effort, forcing a brilliant diving save from Gauci. Yengi attempted to tee up Bernardo in the 90th minute but the young substitute could not get a shot on target. Two minutes into extra time, Maclaren held up the ball for Metcalfe and while Michael Jakobsen got in the way of the midfielder's shot, he did not properly clear it. The shallow clearance fell straight to Maclaren, who buried his 16th goal of the season at the near post to seal the grand final berth and condemn Adelaide to back-to-back semi-final exits.

141,Knee injury sours Ellie Carpenter's Women's Champions League win with Lyon,sport," Sport Australia's Ellie Carpenter stretchered off with knee injury in Lyon's Women's Champions League final win over Barcelona Lyon women have regained their European crown, but the joy is bittersweet for Australia's Ellie Carpenter after she suffered a potentially serious knee injury. The full-back was substituted after 13 minutes of Lyon's 3-1 win in the UEFA Women's Champions League final after her knee gave way in open play. A few minutes earlier she had hurt it while challenging Fridolina Rolfo. She received her medal on crutches with her left leg in a brace, which ran all the way up to her thigh. Lyon were already a goal up when Carpenter departed, Amandine Henry having scored a stunning goal after six minutes. Ada Hegerberg added a second and Catarina Macario a third to put Lyon 3-0 up inside 35 minutes. Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas pulled one back before the break but Lyon used their experience to manage a goal-less second half. Lyon have now won eight of the last 12 Women's Champions Leagues, but this was as warmly received as any having been eclipsed in many people's eyes by Barcelona. However Lyon, who beat Barca 4-1 in the 2019 final, did not play them in last season's competition having been knocked out by domestic rivals Paris St Germain. But they did not have Hegerberg in the team then as she was recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The Norwegian said pertinently before the final: ""There was women's football before Barcelona, and it was played here [Lyon] for years. We have to win again to regain our place in world football."" Hegerberg's recovery — she was outstanding in the final — offers hope for Carpenter if, as feared, she has also suffered an ACL injury, a common injury in women's football. The Matildas will be hoping that Carpenter's recovery will be straightforward with the FIFA Women's World Cup to be played in Australia and New Zealand beginning in July next year. Matildas and Lyon defender Ellie Carpenter opens up on her ""scary"" move abroad, the pressure of replacing a legend and what she's expecting from the Champions League final. Lyon had taken the lead when Henry won possession before scoring from 30 yards. After Jenni Hermoso had missed two good chances Hegerberg headed in Selma Bacha's cross to double the lead. Catarina Macario tapped in a Hegerberg cross with Barca in disarray before Putellas scored in the 41st minute to give them hope. Though Patri Guijarro hit the crossbar in the 58th minute from 50 yards Barcelona were unable to get the second goal which could have had Lyon worried.

142,Western United reach historic A-League Men grand final,sport," Sport Western United defeat Melbourne Victory to reach historic A-League Men grand final Serbian striker Aleksandar Prijović scored twice and added an assist as Western United advanced to their first A-League Men grand final with a 4-1 win over Melbourne Victory at AAMI Park. United made the season decider in just their third season and ended Victory's club-record 16-match unbeaten run in the process, progressing to the final with a 4-2 semi-final aggregate win in a pulsating match on Saturday. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, United twice hit the front as Prijović capitalised on two wonderful crosses to score in each half. Prijović set up the decisive third goal in the 78th minute, as his delightful lay-off fell to Lachie Wales, whose shot deflected off a Victory player into the net for the go-ahead goal. The excellent Dylan Wenzel-Halls added the icing with a fourth in the ninth minute of added time. Prior to United's fourth goal, Victory had a number of chances to level the tie and also had an unsuccessful penalty shout. A Jake Brimmer free kick in the 82nd minute forced a good fingertip save from Jamie Young and Victory twice came close to scoring in the 88th and again in added time, with all three efforts coming from substitutes. Francesco Margiotta hit the post, Chris Ikonomidis blazed a follow up shot from close range over the bar, and Brendan Hamill had a shot pushed away by Young. United scored with their first attempt on target in the 18th minute, with Prijović's far-post header rewarding a delightful cross from Connor Pain. Victory midfielder Brimmer again put his side ahead on aggregate with a peach of a free kick in the 37th minute, the fourth straight match in which he has scored. Young made a full stretch save to keep a powerful Josh Brillante shot out in the first minute of the second half. United briefly thought they were ahead again when Wenzel-Halls's header hit the net just after half-time, only to be correctly ruled out for offside. Three minutes later they did hit the lead through Prijović's fine sliding finish from an excellent Wenzel-Halls cross. Victory ratcheted up the pressure after going behind for a second time, with Young making saves from Ben Folami, Marchan and Nick D'Agostino. The home side were adamant they should have had had a penalty in the 42nd minute when Josh Risdon appeared to foul Rai Marchan. Referee Alex King did not award a spot kick at the time and reaffirmed his decision after being called to the touchline by the VAR to view a replay of the incident.

143,Osaka weighing up whether to go to Wimbledon after first-round French Open exit,sport," Sport Naomi Osaka may sit out Wimbledon after losing in French Open first round to Amanda Anisimova Four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka may not travel to Wimbledon after the decision by the sport's authorities to strip the tournament of ranking points. Osaka's comments came after she was knocked out of the French Open in the first round by 27th seed Amanda Anisimova 7-5, 6-4. Wimbledon last week had its ranking points taken away by the men's ATP and women's WTA after the grasscourt major opted to exclude players from Russia and Belarus because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""I would say the decision is kind of affecting, like, my mentality going into grass. I'm not 100 per cent sure if I'm going to go there,"" four-time major winner Osaka said at a press conference. ""I would love to go just to get some experience on the grass court, but at the same time, for me, it's kind of, I don't want to say pointless, no pun intended, but I'm the type of player that gets motivated by … seeing my ranking go up."" Osaka has been vocal about prioritising her mental health on the gruelling international tennis tour. This year marked her return to Roland Garros after she boycotted press conferences at the 2021 tournament, citing their effect on her mental health. She was fined and ultimately withdrew from the tournament after facing backlash for her decision. The removal of ranking points from Wimbledon was met with ""deep disappointment"" by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), which repeated its stance that the ban was the only viable option under British government guidance. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) also said it would not grant ranking points to Wimbledon this year for junior and wheelchair tennis events. The AELTC decision to impose the suspension on Russian and Belarusian players at this year's championships is the first time players have been excluded on grounds of nationality since the immediate post-World War II era, when German and Japanese players were banned.

144,Top women's seeds suffer shock losses as French Open kicks off,sport,"  Top women's seeds Ons Jabeur, Garbine Muguruza tumble in day one upsets at Roland Garros A pair of major upsets early on day one of the French Open have blown the bottom half of the women's draw wide open at Roland Garros as Madrid champion Ons Jabeur and 2016 champion Garbine Muguruza were sent packing. Muguruza has recently appeared out of sorts, with the world number 10 racking up early losses in Madrid, Rome and Rabat, but appeared to be in good touch early in her opening round match with veteran Estonian Kaia Kanepi and took the first set 6-2. But the ever-dangerous Kanepi, who made the quarter-finals at this year's Australian Open roared back into the match to take it 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 as a frustrated Muguruza slapped the court with her racquet. Kanepi, who has twice made the final eight at Roland Garros — the last time in 2012 — and won the girl's singles back in 2001 simply showed too much class for Muguruza as she out-hit her, cranking winners from both side in the later sets. For the 36-year-old Kanepi, the win opens up her part of the draw which includes fellow Estonian, fifth-seed Anett Kontaveit. Asked how she turned the match around Kanepi said: ""I didn't change much, I just made more balls and my serve was better in the second and third sets."" Her dismissal of Muguruza followed the tournament opening with a shock on Court Phillipe-Chartrier as sixth-seed Jabeur, who has been one of the form players on tour this year, was ousted in three sets by Poland's Magda Linette. Jabeur became the first major casualty when she crashed out with a 3-6, 7-6(7/4), 7-5 loss to the world number 52. Jabeur, seen as one of the big threats to world number one Iga Świątek at the tournament, came to Paris at a career-high ranking and with a tour-leading 17 wins on the surface this season. ""I wanted to go as far as I could in the tournament because I played well on clay in Madrid and in Rome, and it's difficult to take that one in,"" Jabeur said. ""But that's what sport is like and you need to be smart enough to move forward and get back on court. So maybe it was a good thing to lose today. ""I would rather say this and be really tough with myself than waste all the good energy that I got from Madrid and Rome."" With her win in Madrid and runner-up finishes in Rome and Charleston, it appeared Jabeur would have an easy outing against Linette when she made a strong start. The 27-year-old suffered an early break of serve before breezing through the opening set in 37 minutes before Linette raised her game. Linette, 30, had only defeated Jabeur in the first of their four meetings back in 2013 but she staged an inspired fightback in the second set, saving four break points to level the match in the tiebreak. As drops of rain fell on the main showcourt, Jabeur's level also dipped and her unforced errors climbed and she made her frustration evident by kicking balls away after losing points. Linette, who lost to Jabeur in the third round last year, went up 4-2 in the third set but saw her advantage slip away when Jabeur broke her serve back to stay alive. But the Pole sealed the match when the Tunisian wasted a 40-0 lead in the 12th game and found the net on match point to be broken for the second time in the set. ""I lost to her last year here, and then this year in Miami, and so I kind of knew what to expect,"" Linette said. ""I knew that she was really on fire this time and I would really need to play point by point, be really mentally tough. I'm really happy that I managed to stay really calm and strong."" Right at the end of a long, largely wretched day, Australian tennis has found its saviour on a shocking Sunday at the French Open. Step forward never-say-die qualifier Jason Kubler, who finally put a first-round victory on the board at 9.40pm at Roland Garros, more than 10-and-a-half hours after play on a brutally hard opening day began. The first four Aussies in action — Chris O'Connell, Alexei Popyrin, Astra Sharma and Thanasi Kokkinakis — had already bitten the red dust. Then Kubler, the man perhaps least fancied to negotiate his first-round tie, stepped up in the darkness — with the floodlights shining on the ominously numbered Court 13 — and saved the day. The one-time wonder boy of Australian tennis — who had battled through three tough qualifying matches to get to the main draw — defeated streetwise American Denis Kudla 7-6(7/5), 7-6(7/2), 7-6(7/3) to become the first of the 11-strong contingent to make it through. Sydney wildcard O'Connell had kicked off the singles challenge on a humid morning with high hopes, only to depart Court 8 wholly deflated by a 2-6, 4-6, 7(7/5)-6, 1-6 loss to Slovenian Aljaz Bedene. Next to fall was last year's ""big thing"", Popyrin, whose 2022 struggles continued at the hands of Fabio Fognini, the erratic 34-year-old Italian swashbuckler who found the odd touch of his old magic as he gave the young Sydneysider a bit of a lesson 6-4, 7-5, 6-4. Perth's Australian number two Sharma, the first woman in action, came agonisingly close to victory over Varvara Gracheva, standing just two points away from winning when a startling pass from the Russian kick-started her revival to win 4-6, 6-4, 7-5. Sharma was so shocked by Gracheva's winner that she actually applauded her in the heat of battle. Kokkinakis got involved in a real slugfest with Spanish clay-court specialist Albert Ramos-Vinolas, and looked shattered to go down 4-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-7(7/5) in a see-saw four-setter. The pain was obvious for the Adelaide man, who missed out on a second-round date with Spain's new teenage comet Carlos Alcaraz, who just got better and better as he pulverised Argentine Juan Ignacio Londero 6-4, 6-2, 6-0. But former junior world number one Kubler — who'd saved a match point in his second round qualifier against Radu Albot — simply would not be denied as night fell, proving just too teak-tough in each of three tiebreaks that he dominated. He had two match points denied by the American before he hammered a glorious winning backhand down the line in front of a by-now sparse crowd after more than three-and-a-quarter hours, letting out a primal roar.

145,Could there be a changing of the guard at this year's French Open?,sport," Sport Teenage tennis sensation Carlos Alcaraz could signal a changing of the guard with victory at the French Open There was a time when the three certainties in life were death, taxes and Rafael Nadal winning the French Open. The Spanish bull has lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy on a record 13 occasions. Few would discount a 14th triumph but the 35-year-old has been troubled by foot and rib injuries in the past 12 months. At last year's French Open, Nadal lost an epic semi-final to the eventual champion Novak Djokovic. Since then, the exciting Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz has had a rapid rise. At the recent Madrid Open, the 19-year-old became the first player to beat modern greats Nadal and Djokovic in the same tournament on clay. Within three days, he took care of Nadal, Djokovic and then the world number three Alexander Zverev in the final. ""It's an amazing story, I don't think we've seen someone with such flair and capability and natural talent since the man that he's always revered, who is Rafa,"" commentator and former tour player Louise Pleming told ABC Sport. ""He's got power, he's got a lot of energy, and coming off his big win in Madrid, beating Nadal would've been a huge boost, beating Djokovic — I think that's a great sign."" Commentator and six-time grand slam doubles champion Rennae Stubbs believes the world number six Alcaraz is headed for the top. ""There is a real chance that he can be number one in the world by the end of the year,"" Stubbs told the Court-Side with Beilinson tennis podcast. ""The key is can you mentally grasp being the best player in the world, and I think what he's just done in the last couple of months has proven to him that he can be the best player in the world."" The emergence of Alcaraz is similar to the way a 19-year-old Nadal took the tennis world by storm by winning the French Open at his first attempt in 2005. Now a wise veteran, Nadal is not surprised by the hype surrounding his young countryman. ""He's new and all the new things are much more interesting,"" Nadal said at the Italian Open earlier this month. ""When you see a new car, it always looks better, when you see a new phone, it always looks better than the old one. ""I'm happy to have someone like him from my country achieving all the things that he's achieving."" Alcaraz is coached by a man who knows how to win the French Open. Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero lifted the trophy in 2003. His pupil has won four tournaments this year and is the youngest to win the ATP events at Rio, Miami, and Madrid. ""He has no weakness in his game, zero,"" Stubbs said. ""I love the fact that he actually goes into the net a tremendous amount to finish points off. ""He moves better than any player on tour, equivalent to Novak when he was at his best, he has the splits, he can get out wide he can explosively move forward, side to side."" Djokovic himself is hitting form at the right time after beating world number four Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets in the Italian Open final. The unvaccinated world number one won't be lacking motivation after being deported from Melbourne before January's Australian Open. A triumph at Roland Garros would put the Serb back alongside Nadal for the most men's grand slam singles titles (21). ""I feel he is very much an inspired man at the moment,"" Pleming said. ""The form that he was in at Rome, he didn't drop a set there which is phenomenal. ""He's just fine tuning at the right time and I believe he's got that extra fire burning in his belly."" Alcaraz is yet to make his mark in the majors. The best performance in his fledgling career was reaching the quarter-finals of last year's US Open, when a leg injury forced his retirement in the second set against Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime. ""Is this just a little bit early for Alcaraz?"" Pleming said. ""If he plays some five-set matches early on you just wonder physically how he's going to manage that whereas Djokovic just knows how to pace himself. ""He's just got a little bit more of the mentality to last and be there on that final day."" The women's tournament will be the first grand slam since Australia's Ash Barty announced her shock retirement while ranked world number one. Iga Świątek will start the white-hot favourite. The top-ranked Pole has won five tournaments in succession. During that stretch, she's reeled off 28 wins and dropped only five sets. If Świątek is victorious at the French Open, she'll equal Venus Williams's 35 straight victories from the year 2000, which is the best winning streak by a female this century. Świątek was a surprise French Open winner in 2020, but her opponents will know all about her this time. Whether they can stop her is another matter altogether. ""Gosh that seems like the impossible mission at the moment,"" Pleming said. ""I love the way that she plays, she's really taken the baton from Ash Barty. ""She's got the variation, she's got the power, she's using her serve incredibly well but it's the mindset, that something she's borrowed from Barty as well, how to control the mind and her mentality."" Despite being only 20, Świątek has shown no signs of being overwhelmed by the pressure that comes with being expected to win a grand slam. ""For sure the expectations around are higher, but I never had a problem to cut it off and not to think about it,"" Świątek said after winning the Italian Open earlier this month. ""Also I'm gaining experience at that, with more and more tournaments it's going to get better for me to cope with all of that."" There are numerous players in the draw who have the clay court expertise to challenge for the title. World number two Barbora Krejcikova is the defending champion, while world number four Maria Sakkari made the semi-finals last year. Ons Jabeur was on an 11-match winning streak until being swept aside by Świątek in the Italian Open final. Stubbs expects the world number six from Tunisia to perform well in Paris. ""The variety of her game, she plays a little bit like Ash, she uses the slice backhand so beautifully, she has a better two hander than Ash ever did,"" Stubbs said. ""The possibility of Ons winning a grand slam is super high, she has all the shots and of course the drop shot from hell for everybody to play against."" Pleming believes Jabeur is one of the few players capable of upsetting Świątek at Roland Garros. ""It's great to see players that play differently to everybody else, they get to mix it up, they make the other players more uncomfortable than the players who play that hard-hitting aggressive game style."" Whoever wants to win the French Open is likely to face the task of overcoming a former French Open champion in irresistible form, who loves playing on the red clay at Roland Garros. ""I just can't see anyone getting past Iga,"" Pleming said. ""To win a grand slam, it makes it a whole lot easier if you know you've already done it.""

146,Wimbledon stripped of ranking points for banning Russian and Belarussian athletes,sport,"  Wimbledon stripped of ranking points by ATP and WTA for banning Russian and Belarusian athletes The ATP and WTA have stripped Wimbledon of its ranking points over its decision to exclude players from Russia and Belarus at this year's championships due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The tennis governing bodies had banned Russia and Belarus from international team competitions following the invasion, but they have allowed players from the two countries to compete as neutrals. But Wimbledon has gone one step further and banned the athletes outright, prompting the ATP and WTA tours to strip the grand slam of its ranking points, which effectively reduces the world's most famous tennis tournament to an exhibition event. ""The ability for players of any nationality to enter tournaments based on merit, and without discrimination, is fundamental to our Tour,"" the ATP said in a statement. ""The decision by Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer undermines this principle and the integrity of the ATP Ranking system. It is also inconsistent with our Rankings agreement. ""Absent a change in circumstances, it is with great regret and reluctance that we see no option but to remove ATP Ranking points from Wimbledon for 2022."" WTA chief Steve Simon said athletes participating in an individual sport ""should not be penalised or prevented from competing solely because of their nationalities or the decisions made by the governments of their countries"". ""The recent decisions made by the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to ban athletes from competing in the upcoming UK grass court events violate that fundamental principle,"" Simon said. ""As a result of the AELTC's position that it will not honour its obligation to use the WTA rankings for entry into Wimbledon and proceed with a partial field not based on merit, the WTA has made the difficult decision to not award WTA ranking points for this year's Wimbledon Championships."" The move by the AELTC, the organiser of the grass-court grand slam, is the first time players have been banned on grounds of nationality since the immediate post-World War II era when German and Japanese players were excluded. The AELTC has previously said the ban on Russian and Belarusian players was its only viable option under the guidance provided by the British government. On Friday, the AELTC reiterated its stance, adding it was considering its options and was in discussions with its grand slam colleagues. ""In addition, we remain unwilling to accept success or participation at Wimbledon being used to benefit the propaganda machine of the Russian regime,"" the AELTC said in a statement. ""We therefore wish to state our deep disappointment at the decisions taken by the ATP, WTA and ITF in removing ranking points for The Championships. ""We believe these decisions to be disproportionate in the context of the exceptional and extreme circumstances of this situation and the position we found ourselves in, and damaging to all players who compete on Tour."" Wimbledon's ban on Russian and Belarusian players has been slammed by top players such as 21-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal who labelled it unfair, and world number one Novak Djokovic, who said he did not support the decision. ""Our rules and agreements exist in order to protect the rights of players as a whole. Unilateral decisions of this nature, if unaddressed, set a damaging precedent for the rest of the tour,"" the ATP added. ""Discrimination by individual tournaments is simply not viable on a tour that operates in more than 30 countries. ""We remain hopeful of further discussions with Wimbledon leading to an acceptable outcome for all concerned. ""More broadly, we believe this matter again highlights the need for a united governance structure across professional tennis so that decisions of this nature can be made in a joint manner."" While Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) reciprocated the Wimbledon ban by excluding players from the two countries from its tune-up tour events, its decision is still under review by the ATP and WTA and also faces potential sanctions. Meanwhile, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said it would not grant ranking points to Wimbledon this year for junior and wheelchair tennis events. ""The ITF has determined that Wimbledon's entry criteria banning Russians and Belarusians compromises the integrity of its international competition, in particular its ranking system, as there is a lack of alternative equivalent opportunities for players to compete for ranking points and prize money,"" the ITF said.
