0,'Ready and willing': Australian military personnel retrieve occupants of stricken Solomon Islands police boat,politics,"  Australian military personnel rescue occupants of stricken Solomon Islands police boat The Australian Defence Force has declared it is ""ready and willing"" to assist its Pacific family after a weekend rescue of a missing Royal Solomon Islands Police Force boat. While attention was focused on Saturday's federal election, naval personnel working alongside a surveillance aircraft and helicopter managed to locate the stricken Solomon Islands vessel and bring its crew to safety. The mission involving HMAS Ararat, an Australian-contracted surveillance plane as well as an Australian Federal Police-chartered helicopter comes amid a renewed focus on the strategic importance of the Pacific nation, which has just signed a security pact with China. HMAS Ararat commanding officer Lieutenant Commander David Martinussen said the Saturday rescue was ""excellent teamwork"" and a collective effort between partners. ""I am very proud of how professionally the team in HMAS Ararat responded to assist our friends in need,"" Lieutenant Commander Martinussen said. Experts say a new security agreement signed by Beijing and Honiara is ""qualitatively different' to Beijing's past agreements with Pacific nations and the geopolitical context has changed. ""The team was simply outstanding. We assessed the situation and quickly closed the search area from over 200 nautical miles away."" Ararat's commanding officer said his crew felt privileged to be able to provide assistance to friends and fellow mariners. ""When we arrived on station, the vessel's crew and passengers were smoothly embarked in Ararat to ensure their health and wellbeing,"" he said. ""The stricken vessel was then taken under tow. After an overnight escort, the vessel and our guests were safely repatriated onto Southland Island the following morning. ""The Australian Defence Force is ready and willing to respond when our Pacific family call on us for assistance."" Australia's High Commissioner to Solomon Islands, Lachie Strahan, also expressed his appreciation to the personnel involved in the rescue, noting ""all crew and passengers [were] safe and well"". Ever since a draft security agreement between Beijing and Honiara emerged in March, the Australian government has consistently insisted it is the ""security partner of choice"" for Solomon Islands. HMAS Ararat is currently providing maritime surveillance support in the region at the request of the Solomon Islands government.

1,Are we there yet? Tasmanian election results dragging on,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes As the counting of votes gets closer to finalising the election result, those vying for the Tasmanian seats still in play may have to keep the celebratory drinks in the fridge for a little while longer. The election experts might have Bass in Liberal hands, but Labor challenger Ross Hart hasn't called Bridget Archer to concede. ""Not as yet, but I'll do that… if not today, that will be in the near future,"" Mr Hart told reporters in Launceston yesterday. At last check, Ms Archer held a lead of around 1,200 votes in Bass with just short of 74 per cent of the vote counted. In such a narrow race, it's not unusual for candidates to want to wait for postal votes to come in before conceding defeat. However, election analyst Kevin Bonham has seen enough. ""Votes don't move around in the post-count very much in Bass, so that's sufficient to ensure that (Archer) will be returned."" The other Tasmanian seat still considered 'in-doubt' by the ABC is Lyons. At the time of writing, incumbent Brian Mitchell holds an 833-vote lead over Liberal challenger Susie Bower. Mr Mitchell previously held the seat with a 5.2 per cent margin, but that has been whittled away thanks to a 4.5 per cent swing to the Liberals after preferences. Professor Bonham believes those figures are slightly misleading. ""On what I've seen so far, Brian Mitchell appears to be comfortable in Lyons… there is also an issue with apparently incorrect figures in one booth, which if corrected would increase his lead quite a bit."" Professor Bonham said polling booth errors are relatively rare, but can occur as a result of someone simply putting figures into the wrong spreadsheet column. ""Every single booth will be re-checked, and in the process of re-checking every single booth they will find any of these issues and correct them. ""It's important to remember the figures that we're seeing on the screen are not necessarily gospel at this stage."" COVID-19 has dramatically increased the number of postal votes in play during this year's election, due to voters isolating or being unwilling to gather at polling places. In Lyons alone, nearly 15,000 postal-vote applications were received by the Australian Electoral Commission. Professor Bonham said postal votes have favoured the Coalition at previous elections, but the very different make-up of the people applying for postal voting at this election, meant the trend is likely to be less severe. ""In Lyons the postal votes tend to break relatively weakly, not like some seats where there tends to be a big advantage for the Coalition. ""It looks like his (Mitchell's) position is very strong, but I would like to see the next lot of postals just to be sure."" Those keeping an eager eye on the results in Bass and Lyons will have noticed the figures barely moved yesterday. The Australian Electoral Commission told the ABC that's due to a focus on the Senate for much of the day, with a lot of 2,000 Lyons postal votes processed late in the afternoon. The AEC says another two lots of postal votes — one each in Bass and Lyons — will undergo an initial count this morning, and those numbers should start to move again today. While the AEC has to wait nearly two weeks for postal votes to come in, the result should become clear long before then. The Senate result is normally the one to drag out over many days, even weeks, but not this time around. Professor Bonham said ""early on counting night"" it looked as though the Jacqui Lambie Network candidate Tammy Tyrrell would be successful in taking a seat off the Liberals. ""What we have to wait for is the size of Eric Abetz's below-the-line vote just to check that he is the Liberal who is defeated, which I strongly suspect he will be.""

2,'Fish rot from the head': Russia's failure in Ukraine starts with Putin. Can he end his war?,politics,"  Three months into his war in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is holding firm on his plan to restore Russian glory and protect his iron grip on power. To understand why, it pays to understand his past. Things are not going to plan for Vladimir Putin. The once-feared Russian army has long since abandoned its goal of capturing Ukraine's capital Kyiv, and it's been largely beaten back from the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv. Moscow's tactics for its invasion have changed — it is now solely focused on the ground war in the eastern Donbas region, and in the south. In those areas, it has managed to push its lines forward but the gains are incremental, often just a few kilometres at a time. There has been no breakthrough. Many experts classify the fighting now as little more than a standstill, with both sides braced for months of combat ahead. No matter how you look at it, Putin's ""special military operation"" — as he calls it — is far from achieving the goals he spelled out at the beginning of the invasion in his televised address to the nation, and the world, on February 24. ""[The] goal is to protect people who have been subjected to abuse and genocide by the regime in Kyiv for eight years,"" Putin said. ""And for this, we will pursue the demilitarisation and 'de-nazification' of Ukraine."" As the world has witnessed, rather than laying down its arms, Ukraine's armed forces — and its civilians — have mounted fierce resistance. Three months into the war, estimating the scale of Russian losses is difficult — the Kremlin hasn't released any figures for the past two months. Ukraine claims the current toll is now close to 30,000 Russian soldiers killed. Some Western intelligence sources suggest this number is too high. Yet Britain's Ministry of Defence estimates 50,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded. In a sign the losses are mounting, Russia is now considering scrapping the upper 40-year-old age limit for soldiers. At home, Putin still talks of the ""de-nazification"" of Ukraine, but there's little prospect now of toppling the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy has survived attempts to kill him, and his government remains in Kyiv. His video addresses have rallied Ukrainian support at home and around the world. He's had visits from the White House, Downing Street and the UN — the country even won last week's Eurovision song contest. But Putin is showing no sign of weakening. He has acknowledged there will be pain but, according to the world of Vladimir, Russia will endure. On Victory Day earlier this month, the Russian President told his nation and the world his country had no choice but to act in Ukraine. ""The danger was rising by the day,"" he said in his speech on Red Square. ""Russia has given a pre-emptive response to an aggression — [the] only correct decision by a sovereign, powerful and independent country"". Putin said Russian troops in Ukraine had been fighting for ""the motherland"". ""No-one will forget the lessons of World War II and there will be no place in the world for hangmen, executioners and the Nazis"". As international companies abandon the country, as the last vestiges of independent media disappear, as connections to Europe and the US are cut, Russia is bracing for more self-reliance — an existence largely isolated from the West. It's a future Vladimir Putin is very comfortable with. It's much like the country that moulded his past: The USSR. Amidst stories of Vladimir Putin's enormous personal wealth and power, it's worth remembering his childhood. It was simple, typically Soviet, and there is no doubt it shaped him. His father barely survived World War II and he was born after two older siblings had died. The Putins lived in a shared ""kommunalka"" apartment in Leningrad, now St Petersburg. There was one stove and one toilet, shared by three families. At the height of the Cold War in the sixties, most Soviet kids dreamed of becoming cosmonauts. Not Vladimir Putin. As journalist Masha Gessen writes in her biography of Putin, as a teenager he had a portrait of Yan Berzin, the founder of Soviet military intelligence, on his desk. Putin himself enjoys telling the story of how he tried to join the KGB when he was just 16. They passed then, but he did find his way in after graduating from Leningrad State University. It would be hard to describe his KGB career as stellar. Putin had studied German and his only international assignment was in Germany. In 1985 he was posted not to East Berlin, where, as Masha Gessen points out, he could have actively recruited spies in the West, but instead went to Dresden, an industrial city in the heart of East Germany. He was there when the Berlin Wall fell and the German Democratic Republic began to implode. Putin, his first wife and two daughters returned to Leningrad in 1990 as the Soviet Union itself was falling apart. They moved back into one room in his parent's two-bedroom apartment in Leningrad. But soon, his long climb up the political ladder would begin. In 1990, at the age of 38, Putin became an adviser to the Mayor of St Petersburg and gradually became a power player in the city's administration. Within just a few years, he was suspected of orchestrating a multi-million-dollar kickback scheme but he was never charged. At this time, Putin started to learn some valuable lessons about how politics in the new Russia worked. ""His formative years were spent, essentially, as a deputy mayor in St Petersburg (formerly Leningrad), enriching himself off the backs of people who were going hungry,"" said Sydney-based journalist Zoya Sheftalovich, a contributing editor for Politico Europe. ""There wasn't going to be any accountability as long as you kept people very, very close and as long as you maintained a system of corruption that kept the power at the top."" By 1996, he moved to the Kremlin. His KGB background undoubtedly helped him move up the ranks and by 1998, he was running the FSB, the organisation that had succeeded the KGB after the USSR dissolved. Putin was little known outside of the Kremlin when then-president Boris Yeltsin appointed him prime minister in 1999. He was a compromise candidate, not seen as having much political ambition. But many speculated his background in the security services was a big advantage. Putin could provide stability after a period of economic chaos, as well as protecting the financial gains Yelstin and those around him had made while they were in power. Soon after his appointment, a series of apartment bombings swept Russia. Putin blamed Chechen terrorists, but many have suspected the blasts were actually the work of the FSB. ""All of a sudden, we saw these very mysterious bombings in Moscow apartment buildings that had quite interesting links to the FSB … and all of a sudden we had to blame that on Chechnya,"" Sheftalovich said. Putin talked tough and sent Russian troops to crush Chechnya's capital, Grozny. His popularity soared. Relentless favourable coverage from Russia's state media pushed him to the top of a crowded field in the presidential election in 2000. He easily won that election, receiving 53 per cent of the vote — 23 per cent more than his nearest rival, the leader of the Communist Party. Russia's first post-Soviet leader, Boris Yeltsin, had been widely ridiculed. At times he appeared drunk and out of control in public. In the final years of his presidency, Russia's economy was in chaos. Putin quickly set about building an image as the anti-Yeltsin. Bare-chested hunting trips. Judo competitions. Hardworking and deadly serious. And the Russian public liked the image they were shown. Initially, Putin sought to engage the West. In 2001, he addressed the German Bundestag in fluent German and spoke of Russia's place in Europe. ""I am convinced that today we are turning over a new page in our bilateral relations, thereby making our joint contribution to building a common European home,"" he said at the time. Far from ridicule, Putin inspired fear and respect. In 2009, Australian James Blake was one of the few ""Angliiski"" or non-Russians allowed to be in the main Russia Today newsroom when Putin came to visit. RT, as it's known, is the Kremlin's international news channel. ""There was considerable nervousness in the newsroom,"" said Blake, who was RT's business editor at the time. ""I was amazed when someone spilled a cup of coffee on a patch of carpet not far from where I was sitting, and the entire patch was immediately replaced."" Despite days of preparation, what struck Blake was how brief the visit was; Putin was clearly uncomfortable in this kind of environment. ""He and [RT Editor Margarita Simonyan] spent all of about 90 seconds down at the front of the newsroom standing alongside the desk of one of the translators [then], no sooner was he there than he was gone. ""When I asked one of the Russian journalists I was with what she thought of proceedings she replied: 'He is a short man, but he has an energy.'"" Not long after the war in Ukraine began, so did the questions about Putin's hold on power. There was speculation that powerful elements in the security services and the elites might decide the costs of the war were too high, particularly as Russia's invasion became bogged down and the economy felt the heavy impact of sanctions. Some even predicted Putin would be ousted in a coup. But three months into the war, his control in Moscow seems as strong as ever. On Russian state media every night, audiences are fed hours of coverage portraying a very different picture of the war — one in which Ukraine is the aggressor and its troops are the ones committing war crimes. Despite occasional public displays of opposition, Putin can still count on sizeable public support for the war Behind the scenes, there has been plenty of intrigue as security services scramble to escape the fallout from the disastrous pre-war intelligence provided to the Kremlin. But none of that appears to have threatened Putin's control. A little more than a decade ago, there were real questions about whether or not Vladimir Putin would voluntarily give up power. In 2011, Putin had to decide whether he would again run for president after spending one term as prime minister. Russia's constitution forbids more than two consecutive presidential terms, so in 2008 the Kremlin arranged a switch. Deputy PM Dmitry Medvedev easily won the election as Russia's president and he appointed Putin as his prime minister. I arrived as the ABC's correspondent in Moscow during this time and witnessed this political charade play out. Dmitry Medvedev was Russia's president but everyone knew the real power had simply moved to the prime minister's office. No one doubted Vladimir Putin was still running the country. When Kutuzovsky Prospekt, the main road outside our office window, fell silent, that was the cue that in a few minutes Putin's convey would be speeding down the closed-off eight-lane street into the centre of Moscow. But he wasn't heading to the Kremlin. In the period from 2008-2012, the prime minister's office was in the ""Russian White House"", the Russian Federation Government House on the Moscow River. The real power had followed Putin there. As the decision whether to return to the presidency approached, the Arab Spring revolutions were sweeping the Middle East. The events deeply impacted Putin. ""Seeing the film footage of the Arab Spring was what caused him to essentially take power back because he didn't think he could trust Medvedev to keep his grip on power,"" said Sheftalovich. ""It's quite well known that he saw the mobile phone footage of [Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi] being captured and then tortured and killed. ""Apparently, according to those who were close to him, [he was] horrified by that footage. ""I think he saw that what was happening to Gaddafi could very well happen to him."" Sheftalovich lived in Ukraine until she was seven years old, when it was still part of the USSR. Her family immigrated to Australia in 1992. For her, the fear of an Arab Spring-type revolution in Russia is one of the drivers behind Putin's war in Ukraine. And it's not just NATO, she says, it's that Ukraine was on the path to becoming a successful, democratic country. ""I think for Putin, you don't want an example of a successful democracy right next door speaking your language."" From the Kremlin's viewpoint, if Ukraine could move to the West, so, theoretically, could Russia. And that would mean Putin and his entire power apparatus, all of their wealth and influence, would be dismantled. Sheftalovich believes for those around Putin, there's no turning back. ""These people are not going to care about the lost lives and wanting to stop Putin for any sort of ideological reason,"" she said. ""The only thing they care about is their own skins, and it doesn't look great for them if Putin leaves."" The Kremlin now faces a harsh reality: its military has been out-fought on the ground, and its generals have been out-thought in command. How could the Russian army perform so poorly? ""Fish rot from the head,"" said recently retired Australian Army major general Mick Ryan. ""When you have a bad strategy from the start, you can't fix that."" From the battle for Snake Island to a spate of military general deaths and the devastating loss of a battalion crossing a river, Russia's mistakes on the battlefield have left Vladimir Putin in an embarrassing position. Ryan, now a military strategist, has been following the war closely. He's written about battlefield developments for the ABC and for his more than 200,000 followers on Twitter, his analysis has become required reading. ""Vladimir Putin made three incorrect assumptions: Ukraine is not a real country, Ukraine wouldn't fight, and the West wouldn't intervene,"" Ryan said. ""All three proved wrong."" Wars only end, according to Ryan, when one side is defeated or through negotiation. He tips the latter. There will be some sort of peace deal, ""but not yet"". He said Russia needed to do more to claim some form of victory in Donbas and the south after Ukraine had a taste of success in Kyiv and Kharkiv. ""They're both going to want to duke it out a bit more."" A plausible victory — one that can be sold to the Russian people — is the only way out for Putin and those around him. It seems no amount of civilian deaths or economic hardship will keep them from that goal. Russia flattened Grozny in Chechnya. It unleashed terrible destruction on Aleppo in Syria. It's now doing the same in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has learned the lesson: the best way to protect power is to hang onto it. Even if it takes a war.

3,"China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, set to make two-week Pacific Islands visit",politics,"  China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, arriving for two-week Pacific Islands visit Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi looks set to visit at least five Pacific Islands nations over the coming two weeks in a marathon trip designed to signal Beijing's broader ambitions in the Pacific and strengthen China's commercial and security ties with the region. Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare publicly confirmed the visit from Wang Yi yesterday. In a national address, Mr Sogavare said that his country would ""receive a high-level visit from the government of the People's Republic of China later this week"". The ABC has been told the Foreign Minister will arrive in Solomon Islands late on Wednesday night, and that he will meet with Mr Sogavare and other senior leaders on Thursday. His visit comes just weeks after the two countries agreed to a controversial new security pact, and is a powerful reminder of the strategic challenges which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has to grapple with after taking office on Monday. The Solomon Islands government said yesterday that Mr Wang and ""his almost 20 member delegation"" would spend a day in Honiara ""attending various high level meetings, courtesy calls on the Prime Minister and acting Governor-General, and hosting a press conference alongside his counterpart, Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele"". It said a ""highlight"" of the visit would be ""the signing of a number of key bilateral agreements with the national government"", while praising the trip as a ""milestone"" in the relationship between the two countries. The release did not say if Honiara would host a ceremony to formally sign the security pact already agreed to by both countries, but the agreement has stirred deep unease in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, countries that fear it might open the door to a Chinese military presence in Solomon Islands. Wang Yi is also expected to visit Fiji on Sunday and Monday, and Papua New Guinea next week on June 2 and 3. Diplomatic sources said they believed the Foreign Minister would also travel to other Pacific Islands nations, listing Vanuatu, Samoa, Tonga and Kiribati as possible destinations. The trip is certain to be monitored very closely, both by Canberra and by Washington. Kiribati only re-established diplomatic recognition of China in 2019, but the relationship has rapidly evolved since then. Last year, Opposition MPs in Kiribati fiercely criticised a China-backed plan to upgrade a World War II-era airstrip in the country, suggesting Beijing was eyeing it as a possible military base. The Financial Times also reported on the weekend that China was trying to strike a security agreement with Kiribati and at least one more unnamed Pacific Islands nation, citing US intelligence officials. That report also suggested that those agreements could be similar to the one agreed to by China and Solomon Islands. The government of Kiribati has denied that claim outright, but the country's strategic location — only a few thousand kilometres from the massive US naval base in Hawaii — means US officials are anxious about any prospect of a Chinese presence. One senior Western government official told the ABC on Sunday that it was ""very plausible"" that China was looking to sign security pacts in the Pacific, but wouldn't be drawn on whether the government had any hard intelligence suggesting they were imminent. Dr Graeme Smith from the Australian National University told the ABC that there had been persistent reports in Kiribati that China was seeking a security agreement with the country. He said it was hard to say whether Kiribati would accept such a deal, but Solomon Islands' agreement could have significant ramifications: ""Once there's precedent … it becomes a question of, 'Well, Solomon Islands is still standing and they've signed, if you want the full friendship, why don't you sign on too?'"" Dr Smith said Kiribati, which reinstated ties with Beijing in 2019, was at a similar stage in its diplomatic relationship with China as Solomon Islands. ""At this stage in the relationship, there's a much greater intensity of engagement,"" he said. He also said Kiribati was more strategically important to China than Solomon Islands. For Pacific nations, climate change is not a future event — it's already happening. ""It stretches 3,000 kilometres from East to West. It's fairly close to Hawaii,"" he said. ""And it has a massive exclusive economic zone in terms of the territorial waters."" In Fiji, Wang Yi is likely to meet not just with Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama but also with senior officials at the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in the capital, Suva. One Pacific Islands government source said Wang Yi would also likely hold a virtual meeting with several other Pacific Islands foreign ministers while in the country. Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape confirmed yesterday the Chinese embassy in Port Moresby had advised his government of the Foreign Minister's visit to PNG next week. ""The Foreign Minister is a high minister by raking, in as far as the Chinese Government structure is concerned,"" he said. ""And, so, if he confirms to fly in here, the Papua New Guinean Government will give him all the respect that he deserves, and all the protocols.""

4,Albanese marks first full day as Prime Minister on the world stage,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Anthony Albanese is about to face his first major test as Australia's new Prime Minister, spending his first full day in office on the world stage. Mr Albanese flew to Japan yesterday, soon after being sworn into office alongside four of his most senior colleagues. During the flight, Mr Albanese had a phone conversation with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson where the two discussed the AUKUS agreement and the challenges of responding to climate change. The new PM is in Tokyo with Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong to meet with the leaders of Japan, India and the United States for a meeting of the Quad. Mr Albanese was sworn in as Prime Minister earlier in the day, despite votes still being counted, to ensure he could attend the meeting in person. The four countries are expected to unveil a new plan designed to monitor and prevent illegal fishing across the region, which environmentalists have blamed largely on massive Chinese shipping fleets. Quad leaders will also discuss China's growing military aggression, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, climate change and the Quad's ambitious plan to distribute COVID-19 vaccines around the region. Crucially, Mr Albanese will also hold individual bilateral meetings with US President Joe Biden, Indian President Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. Yesterday evening, Mr Albanese also had his first call with the British Prime Minister while jetting to Tokyo, speaking to Boris Johnson for a full half-hour on the new AUKUS security agreement and climate change. The Governor-General also swore in Richard Marles as Deputy Prime Minister, Jim Chalmers as Treasurer and Katy Gallagher as Finance Minister. They will share all the ministries on an interim basis until the full frontbench is finalised after a Caucus meeting early next week. Back home, vote counting is continuing and Labor is edging closer to reaching the 76 votes needed to govern in majority. Labor will not form a majority in the Senate and will need the support of the Greens and likely two other crossbenchers to pass its legislation without the Coalition's support. Mr Albanese has pledged to swear in a full ministry next Wednesday. He has to find at least two new Cabinet ministers after former frontbenchers Kristina Keneally and Terri Butler lost at the weekend. Labor will also have to pick a new deputy Senate leader to serve alongside Senator Wong. Senator Keneally, a member of the Right faction, previously held that role but vacated it to seek a Lower House seat. Pressure is on the party to ensure it is a woman, given two men lead the party in the Lower House, but party sources concede there is not an obvious woman from the right faction. Left faction frontbencher, and new Finance Minister, Katy Gallagher is an obvious candidate but yesterday would not comment if she would get the job — something that would likely require a trade with the right faction. ""Those are matters, internally, for the Labor Party through our Caucus process and I am not going to stand here and pre-empt any of those discussions,"" Senator Gallagher said. The Liberal Party is on the hunt for its next leader to replace former prime minister Scott Morrison. Former defence minister Peter Dutton is emerging as the most likely replacement. The race is also on for the Liberal deputy role, with former social services minister Anne Ruston, a senator, among the contenders. Former home affairs minister Karen Andrews and marginal Tasmanian MP Bridget Archer have both said they were considering nominating for deputy. Some in the party are pushing for a woman to serve as deputy as the party seeks to rebuild its relationship with women. Independent women in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, often dubbed teals, caused some of the biggest damage to the Liberals, winning once-safe heartland Coalition seats. The Nationals' leadership is also on the line. The party has a ballot for leader after each election, irrespective of the outcome. Incumbent and former deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce is seeking to stay in the job and points to the Nationals holding all its seats as a reason he should continue. But Nationals were already canvassing Mr Joyce's future as leader even before the election outcome. His deputy, David Littleproud, appears to be the frontrunner, while former leader Michael McCormack has previously flagged he would be eager to return to the job.

5,Former head of government department at centre of Paul Whyte public sector fraud to be grilled,politics,"  CCC begins public examination into Department of Communities following Paul Whyte fraud case The former head of a government department hit by one of Western Australia's biggest corruption scandals since WA Inc is set to be grilled in public for the first time since details of the $27 million swindle emerged. Former Department of Communities senior bureaucrat Paul Whyte was jailed in November for 12 years for the massive theft of taxpayer funds, which he perpetrated in part by submitting invoices for non-existent work from a friend's companies. He used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle and feed his gambling habit and involvement with racehorses. The Corruption and Crime Commission has taken the unusual step of holding public examinations into the department, to determine how such large-scale fraud could have taken place and what governance systems are in place at the massive department. The commission made some proceedings public in 2020, prior to Whyte's criminal trial. This week, the questioning of two witnesses is being made public, with the department's former director-general Grahame Searle to give evidence in public on Friday and chief financial officer Lorne O'Mara, who gave evidence on Monday. Mr O'Mara was shown a series of invoices for combined payments of just under $50,000 each per month that were paid to a company called Boldline with Whyte's corporate credit card. A business formally trading as Boldline Business Services and operating under the same ABN is owned by an associate of Whyte's, who is also facing criminal charges. Mr Searle was in charge of authorising payments made by Whyte on his corporate credit card. Counsel assisting the commissioner Anthony Willinge asked Mr O'Mara whether these invoices would have caused him concern. Mr O'Mara said Mr Searle should have asked what the payments were for. ""It smells"", Mr O'Mara said. ""There is no project number attached."" The ABC is not suggesting Mr Searle was aware of or involved with Whyte's fraud. Mr O'Mara today characterised Mr Searle's leadership as ""quite aloof"" and ""private sector-style"", saying he delegated a lot of decision-making and focused instead on strategic issues. The hearing heard that under Mr Searle, Mr O'Mara was not able to report directly to him on matters of finance but reported to another person, who themselves reported to Whyte. Whyte reported to Mr Searle. Mr O'Mara said under Mr Searle, business became more complicated as the department started to rely more heavily on contract labour, which Mr O'Mara said ended up costing more. He also detailed how two financial controls were removed with the implementation of systems favoured by Mr Searle. Due to issues with accounting software called AX2012, introduced under Mr Searle, purchase orders stopped being used inside that system. Mr Searle also asked for contract staff attached to that program to be let go. Those staff performed a process known as ""receipting"" — matching purchase orders to invoices — which was one of the financial controls in place.

6,Who are the crossbenchers after the election? And how will they vote in Parliament?,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Who are the crossbenchers after the election? And how will they vote in Parliament? Australia is facing a supersized crossbench in the wake of the ""teal wave"" of independents and the unprecedented number of Greens candidates elected into parliament. While there is a still a path to Labor to form a majority government, the crossbench could be influential over the next three years. But what does all this mean for the new parliament? And who are these new crossbenchers? To put it simply, members of parliament who are not members of the government or the opposition sit on the crossbench. They could be independents or from minor parties. Coming into the election, there were six MPs outside of Labor and the Coalition in the House of Representatives. In the Senate there were 14 members on the crossbench. It's looking like the number of crossbenchers could more than double in the House of Representatives. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog For the new parliament, it depends on whether the Labor gain enough seats to govern as a single majority government. The Labor party needs at least 76 seats in the House of Representatives to do that. Any less and they will need support from outside the party. That's where the crossbenchers come in. In a minority government crossbenchers are needed to guarantee what is called ""confidence and supply"", which basically allows the government to function. But in that case Labor would need to negotiate the support of independents and/or Greens MPS. One result of having more MPs on the crossbench means that the Labor party will have more MPs to negotiate with in the case they can't form a majority government. Here are some of the new and re-elected crossbenchers: Mackellar (Vic) Sophie Scamps is a Sydney doctor and one of the several so-called ""teal independents"" who will be elected. She lists climate, integrity, health and the economy as among her key policies. At the top of that list is setting a 50 per cent limit on climate pollution by 2030. ""This is about genuinely trying to represent our community and take our voice and values to Canberra. We're super excited. This is a win for democracy,"" Dr Scamps said on Saturday night. North Sydney (NSW) Kylea Tink is a businesswoman who has worked for communications firm Edelman Australia and the McGrath Foundation. She is an advocate for urgent climate action who says she will advocate ""a clear and actionable plan to reduce national emissions guided by experts to achieve at least 60 per cent by 2030"". She also wants to make North Sydney one of the first net zero urban zones. ""Thank you, North Sydney. The work begins today,"" she said on social media on Sunday. Goldstein (Victoria) Zoe Daniel is a former ABC journalist who thanked Cathy McGowan, the so-called ""godmother"" of the independent movement, on Saturday night. She said she planned to ""inject some sensible decision making"" and empathy, honesty and sincerity into federal politics. Integrity is among her top priorities, calling for a ""fully independent and properly funded statutory body in the form of a National Integrity Commission"". Wentworth (NSW) Allegra Spender is a businesswoman who was the managing director for fashion labels Carla Zampatti and Bianca Spender. She is the daughter of late fashion designer Carla Zampatti and former Liberal MP John Spender. ""This is a moment to end the climate wars and I'm so proud the community has stood up for that as well,"" she said. ""It's also very exciting, in terms of what's going to happen in this parliament. ""I will be pushing for the agendas that the community I am standing for have pushed for me, which is climate, it's integrity, it's a future focused economy for the long term that is truly inclusive."" Kooyong (Victoria) Monique Ryan is a paediatric neurologist who appears to have beaten Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in the inner-Melbourne seat of Kooyong. But her team was ""not calling it a win just yet"". Ms Ryan says Mr Albanese would need to be ""prepared to come to the table on effective and immediate action on climate change, and on an ICAC that met with an appropriate model for that"". ""We have to have immediate action on climate change. We can't wait,"" she said. Griffith (Queensland) Max Chandler-Mather says he backs policies that roll back the privatisation of services like electricity and including dental into Medicare. His campaign website says he has worked as a strategist in previous Greens campaigns in Queensland, as well as working in a call centre and in after school care. Ryan (Queensland) Elizabeth Watson-Brown is an architect from the Brisbane riverside suburb of Saint Lucia. ""It is a really, really interesting representation that the tectonic plates are shifting in politics in Australia,"" she said. ""Many people came up to me at pre-poll and said to me, 'Elizabeth, I am going to vote for you this time. I had been a long-term Liberal voter and I feel completely abandoned"". Fowler (NSW) Dai Le is the the deputy mayor of Fairfield. In 2016, she was suspended from the Liberal Party for a decade after running as an independent in the Fairfield mayoral race. Her campaign has been centred on the fact she is a local who lived through the harsh lockdown alongside voters in the Western Sydney seat. Ms Le came to Australia as a refugee when she was 11, and is a prominent member of the local Vietnamese community. She describes herself as a ""true independent"" who is willing to work with all parties to secure more services for her local area. Kennedy (Queensland) Bob Katter originally won the seat of Kennedy in 1993 (three years after his father retired as the member) as a National MP. He left the party in 2001, and was re-elected as an independent until he formed Katter's Australian Party in 2012. ""I would like to thank everyone who worked on my polling booths, a very humbling experience for me,"" Mr Katter posted to social media on Saturday. Melbourne (Vic) Adam Bandt, a former lawyer, became the first Green to win a seat in the House of Representatives at a general election in 2010. He is the Greens leader. ""This result is a mandate for action on climate and inequality,"" he said on Sunday morning. ""We put an alternative to people and people liked what they saw. A record number of people voted Greens for the first time at this election."" Clark (Tasmania) Andrew Wilkie is a former infantry officer and has previously been a member of the Liberal Party and the Greens. Mr Wilkie has held the Hobart-based seat, formerly called Denison, since 2010, where he made the removal of poker machines one his main campaign issues. ""I am delighted to be in a position to retain the seat of Clark,"" he said. ""I will continue to work hard to honour the trust the community has placed in me and I will never take it for granted."" Indi (Victoria) Helen Haines is a former nurse and midwife who was first elected in 2019. She succeeded Cathy McGowan, who won the seat from the Liberals in 2013 and 2016. ""I look forward to fighting for all of you, for integrity in politics, for action on climate change, for health care in our region,"" she said on social media on Saturday. Mayo (South Australia) Rebekha Sharkie was the first member of the Nick Xenophon Team to be elected to the House of Representatives in 2016. The party is now called the Centre Alliance and aims to work across both major parties to achieve results for South Australians. Warringah (NSW) Zali Steggall has defended her seat of Warringah after ousting former prime minister Tony Abbott in 2019. The Olympic-medal winning skier and barrister says climate policy and a federal integrity commission are just some of the issues she'll bring to the next parliament. ""I am here to represent the issues the people of Warringah want to see answers on and that is climate policy that is a federal integrity commission that has teeth that deals with corruption,"" she said. ""It is respect for women and workplace it is fiscal discipline we need to stop the rorts and start spending taxpayers money carefully.""

7,"The federal parliament has a bunch of new, more diverse faces",politics,"  For decades, there has been criticism that Australia's parliaments have failed to reflect the nation's multiculturalism. ""Too white"" or ""out of touch"" has been a critique levelled at both sides of the political aisle. At this election, both major parties made attempts to broaden their memberships to improve diversity. As the voting counts are finalised, the new 47th Parliament of Australia appears likely to bring a new set of culturally and linguistically diverse politicians into the fold, perhaps an indication that times are changing — though it has lost some prominent representatives too. According to the 2016 census, more than 10 per cent of Australia's population identified as Asian Australian and a further 2.8 per cent described themselves as Indian Australian. yet at the 2019 election, only three candidates of Asian ancestry were elected into parliament. Saturday's vote sees Dai Le (Fowler), Michelle Ananda-Raja (Higgins), Sally Sitou (Reid), Sam Lim (Tagney), Cassandra Fernando (Holt) and Zaneta Mascarenhas (Swan) newly entering the lower house, although Gladys Liu (Chisolm) has lost her seat. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Ms Fernando was born in Sri Lanka and moved to Melbourne when she was 11. Ms Mascarenhas, a former fly-in fly-out worker, was born in Kalgoorlie to parents from Goa in India. On Monday, Ms Le reflected on her journey from fleeing war-torn Vietnam to contesting one of Labor's safest seats and dislodging one of its most recognisable members. ""I still can't believe it,"" Ms Le wrote on Twitter. ""I still remember lying on that rickety boat in the middle of the ocean not knowing if our family will survive; camp's life, rebuilding our lives in Australia, and now, elected by the people of Fowler. An honour."" The new Labor government has pledged to support the Uluru Statement and an Indigenous voice to parliament. But within the parliament itself, Indigenous Australians have historically been rarely represented. In the last parliament, there were just six Indigenous members in the entire parliament. Although Ken Wyatt will lose his seat, Aboriginal Australians Jana Stewart (Victoria Senate), Jacinta Price (NT Senate), Marion Scrymgour (Lingiari) and Gordon Reid (Robertson) were all successful in their respective races. Ms Scrymgour was the first Indigenous woman elected into the Northern Territory Parliament. The ascent of the Climate 200-backed ""teal"" independents has placed the issue of gender equality firmly on the political agenda. Fourteen new women will join parliament and seven seats contested by women remain too close to call. The message from the weekend was the things that really matter to women matter at the ballot box, too. In the previous parliament, 32 women populated the senate and just 40 made up the house of representatives (less than a third). Projected Kooyong victor Monique Ryan told the ABC on Monday that the rise of women in this election cycle was a result of the government dropping the ball on women's issues. ""The population of Australia expects better,"" Dr Ryan said. ""This is a government that hasn't even kept women in its own workplace, it's a government which has seen an increase in homelessness in women over 50, it's a government that in nine years has failed to take action on the gender pay gap … this is what the people are dissatisfied with."" A final Senate hopeful to watch is Labor candidate Fatima Payman, an Australian Muslim with cultural roots from Afghanistan. Ms Payman is 27 and on her candidate page says only a few years ago, she and her three siblings were being provided for by her dad, an Afghan refugee who was ""working around the clock"" as a security guard, taxi driver and kitchen hand to ensure his children had a better life. Ms Payman makes a point of being proud of her identity and has embraced her story as a reflection of a new, more diverse, Australia. ""While he worked around the clock as a kitchen hand, a security guard and a taxi driver, Mum looked after us before starting her own small business of providing driving lessons,"" Ms Payman wrote. ""Dad instilled in me the values of hard work and perseverance."" In 2018, Ms Payman's father died from leukaemia. She describes it as a turning point in her life and after her father's death, she became active in WA as a community organiser and union representative so she could, in her words, help people like her dad. Ms Payman sits in the third position on the WA Senate ticket, which means she is a chance to accompany the swathe of diverse Australians joining the parliament. The incoming government has pledged to make Australia fairer and more equal. A more diverse parliament could be a good catalyst.

8,Labor wins John Howard's former seat for only second time in more than 70 years,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The Labor Party has claimed the Liberal stronghold seat of Bennelong in Sydney's north shore for only the second time in more than 70 years. The seat, which was once held by former prime minister John Howard, will now go to Labor's Jerome Laxale after a significant swing. Liberal candidate Simon Kennedy was unable to succeed popular MP John Alexander who opted not to contest the election, squandering the party's 6.9 per cent margin. Labor now has 73 seats, three seats short of forming a majority government. ABC chief election analyst Antony Green said the postal votes came through for Labor. ""The postal vote that were counted today broke even,"" he said. ""The Coalition needed to improve their vote on the postal vote but today they broke even."" Bennelong takes in all of Ryde Council and smaller areas from Hornsby and Parramatta councils in an area covering 60 square kilometres on the lower north shore. Mr Laxale, who had been mayor for Ryde Council for five years, had been quietly confident of his chances. He congratulated Anthony Albanese on Twitter after being elected as the country's 31st Prime Minister. ""From housing commission to the lodge, this is the incredible promise of Australia,"" he said. ""I hope to be part of a government that continues to protect that tradition."" In April, Mr Kennedy appeared in a video opposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates and saying there may be concerns about the safety of mRNA vaccines at an event organised by Australia's anti-lockdown movement. He also suggested it was wrong for people to have lost their jobs for refusing to get vaccinated. Mr Kennedy later clarified his comments, saying vaccine mandates were a  ""complex and emotive issue"". Bennelong has been held by the Liberal Party for all but one term since its creation in 1949. It was held by the Labor Party from 2007 to 2010, after Maxine McKew defeated Mr Howard. Mr Alexander won the seat of Bennelong from Labor in the 2010 election. In November 2021, the former tennis player opted not to contest the election, deciding to retire from politics.

9,Emergency department doctor celebrates Indigenous Labor members' 'historic' result,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes An Aboriginal emergency doctor who snatched the bellwether seat of Robertson says having more First Nations members of parliament will create more inclusive policy. Wiradjuri man Gordon Reid, 29, was born and bred on Darkinjung country on the NSW Central Coast. ""It's very special, it's very exciting to be part of an Indigenous caucus,"" he said. ""I think it's very important because it can help guide and inform policy to make policy more inclusive for all Australians in particular Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people."" Indigenous Labor MP and incoming Indigenous affairs minister, Linda Burney, talked up Mr Reid's election victory, describing him as one of six First Nations people in the Labor Party caucus. ""Three in the Senate and three in the House of Representatives,"" Ms Burney told David Speers on Sunday night. The other Indigenous Labor parliamentarians were Marion Scrymgour in Lingiari, and Malarndirri McCarthy, Jana Stewart and Patrick Dodson for the Senate. ""It is historic,"" Ms Burney said. ""If you had said to me … five years ago we're going to have six people in the 2022 election, I would not have believed it was possible. She said it would assist the caucus in tasks such as the full implementation of the Uluru statement. Dr Reid also hoped being a younger member would provide another perspective for parliament. ""We need to make sure we're acting on things like climate change [and] helping working families and people around my age who are a significant part of this community."" His nan, Wiradjuri woman Robyn Reid, said he was a quiet achiever, could speak Indonesian and play the saxophone. She had one piece of advice for him. ""I said even if your own party asks you to do something, you think about it,"" she said. ""Now maybe nan shouldn't be telling him what to do in Canberra but why shouldn't a nana tell him what to do in Canberra?"" Dr Reid said there were significant similarities between medicine and politics. ""It's about people,"" he said. ""One of the biggest things in medicine is you have someone who has an issue and you have to find a solution otherwise there can be drastic consequences."" He said his new role would involve solving people's issues as an elected representative. ""It's making sure we're communicating with people from all walks of life,"" he said. Dr Reid used his medical experience to his advantage during the campaign. His election material was branded with the reference ""emergency doctor"" and he highlighted the region's chronic doctor shortage at any opportunity. One of Labor's campaign promises was to trial 50 Medicare urgent care clinics to take pressure off hospital emergency departments. Robertson and the neighbouring marginal electorate of Dobell are each set to receive one. Dr Reid said it wasn't the only solution. ""It's part of the bigger picture,"" he said. ""There are many different levers we have to pull as a government to make it easier for people to access healthcare."" He said he would always advocate for more health services. ""I'll always advocate for good health policy … it's a passion of mine,"" he said. Dr Reid secured a swing of more than 7 per cent over Liberal incumbent Lucy Wicks, who had held the seat for nine years. Robertson is currently the longest-held bellwether electorate in the country, won by the party that has formed government at every election since 1983. UNSW political analyst Mark Rolfe said there was not much science behind the bellwether status. ""Robertson is a sort of mini representation of Australia at large,"" Dr Rolfe said. ""The issues of Robertson have resonated nationally as well.""

10,The election showed women can no longer be ignored. So what are Labor going to do for them?,politics,"  Women were everywhere and nowhere in the 2022 federal election. The message from the weekend's vote was that the things that really matter to women and their communities matter at the ballot box, too. Even if they were not part of the conversations the major parties were having. We know that women have been trending away from the Liberal Party for almost 40 years. And we also know polls suggest women care about climate change more than men and, of course, we know they care about being respected and living in safety. The most conspicuous winners on Saturday night were the so-called teal candidates. From Zoe Daniel and Monique Ryan in Melbourne to Zali Stegall, Sophie Scamps, Kylea Tink and Allegra Spender in Sydney and Kate Chaney in Perth, politics-as-usual is being revolutionised by independent women. Several well-funded independents ran against established Liberals on a promise of climate action and government integrity. Here's how the night has turned out for them. Here we have seen a swathe of well-credentialed, professional women secure stunning victories in metropolitan seats that have historically provided the Liberal Party with its power base. This is a trend started by former independent Cathy McGowan in 2013 in Indi. McGowan, who has continued to advise the current crop of candidates, wanted local members who actually listened to their constituents. The teals made gender equality one of their top priorities, also situating it within an interlinked set of policy positions including anti-corruption and climate change. And they have been rewarded with history-making wins. Their impact on Australia's political scene is already seismic and we're barely 24 hours post-election. But we also saw significant gains from women in other parts of the political spectrum. Liberal MP Bridget Archer held her seat against the tide, having stood up for integrity issues and LGBTIQ+ rights during the last parliament. Also in Tasmania, Jacqui Lambie increased her Senate team to two, with the likely election of Tammy Tyrrell. In Western Australia, Labor's surprise success stories were female candidates like Zaneta Mascarenhas turning blue seats red. And in Sydney, independent Dai Le showed the major parties they can't take local communities for granted, after she ousted parachuted Labor star Kristina Keneally. This election is a stark warning about treating communities with contempt. We have known for some time the Coalition had ""women problems"" (Tony Abbott's first cabinet had just one woman — Julie Bishop — in 2013). These were exacerbated in 2021 with Brittany Higgins's allegations of rape at Parliament House and the dismissive way the Coalition and Scott Morrison responded to concerns. Anthony Albanese and Labor have pledged to do more. It was noticeable the incoming prime minister made specific references to women in his victory speech and was prominently introduced by incoming Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong. He has already appointed Linda Burney, the first Aboriginal woman elected to the House of Representatives, as Indigenous Affairs Minister. Tanya Plibersek is expected to take the lead on women's policy as Minister for Women. But what have they promised and is it enough? Labor's commitment to fully implement all the Australian Human Rights Commission's 55 Respect@Work recommendations is welcome news to the thousands of women who participated in the March4Justice last year. We of course now need to watch to make sure this happens the way Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins intended. Labor will also now have carriage of Jenkins's other recommendations — to improve the culture at parliament house. This includes Labor Party culture. Labor says Australia should be ""leading the world in equality between women and men"". In policy terms, Labor is pledging to make child care cheaper and to support women in insecure work. This means that wages in female-dominated industries — such as care work — need to lead the policy discussion. Scott Morrison can't say he wasn't warned that women were angry. But will the next Liberal leader heed the lessons Morrison ignored? But there's also a need for greater focus on the gendered nature of poverty and disadvantage. More could be done around fixing the adequacy of income supports. We know that most people who receive parenting payments (more than 90 per cent) are women. More also needs to be done to invest in social housing, in addition to the lack of affordable housing overall. It is reasonably clear the new Albanese government recognises the structural barriers to genuine equality. But with the Coalition's stage three tax cuts totalling $15.7 billion annually backed by Labor — a legislated change that will overwhelmingly benefit high-income men — it is difficult to see how much-needed structural reform is to be funded and implemented. Labor says it is making a ""record"" $3 billion investment into women's safety. As part of this, it is pledging $77 million on consent and respectful relationships education. It will also spend $157 million for more community workers to support women in crisis and put 10 days of domestic violence leave into the National Employment Standards. Policymakers frequently fail to grasp the depth, complexity, and impact of violence on women and children. There are also clear links between women's safety and economic security, including the need to address income support, homelessness, and housing. The economic cost of violence against women and children is huge, but the policy debate is constantly framed in terms of money spent. We will need to watch this area closely for signs of real progress and lives being saved and better supported. Finally, we also need to be cautious about how we speak about ""women"" and ""women voters"". An effective gender agenda needs to take account of the diversity of women's interests. Analysts do women a tremendous disservice by supposing that women are a single voting block or socially homogeneous group. Diversity is something feminists have long attempted to place squarely at the centre of policy discussion. This includes economic and cultural differences in a population in which diversity is not a politically ""marginal"" issue but simply a description of mainstream Australian society. Women have been angry, hurt and disappointed by major party politics in recent years. The results of the weekend show change at the ballot box is possible. We can only hope it now translates into change where it is needed most.

11,The Quad will be looking for signs Australia is serious about resetting. Can Albanese and Wong deliver?,politics,"  Extreme weather events are the new normal. The use of nuclear weapons by Vladimir Putin's Russian military is now a once-unthinkable possibility. And Xi Jinping's China, our largest trading partner and a rising superpower, is pulling down the shutters. So no pressure, then, for our freshly-minted 31st prime minister as he flies into the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue in Tokyo this week. The immediate challenge facing incoming Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong is to reassure allies and friends of continuity and certainty. But more than that, the change of government presents an opportunity to build confidence in Australia's capacity, once taken for granted, for visionary leadership and humble decency. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The Quad involves India, Japan, the United States and Australia. It began in 2007, under George W Bush and John Howard, but Australia pulled back under Kevin Rudd because of concerns about America's approach to China. The Labor leader is officially sworn in as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia, ahead of a trip to Tokyo to meet with Quad leaders. Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull revived the arrangement in 2017 as concerns mounted about China's military expansion in the South China Sea. In March 2021 the Quad leaders issued a joint statement. ""The Spirit of the Quad"" spoke of a ""rules-based maritime order in the East and South China seas"" that supported a ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific"". At this week's meetings, Japan and India will be looking for signs Australia is serious about engaging with Asia. Another old friend with deep and long-established links in Asia — France — will be looking for signs of a reset. The US will be reviewing its expectations of what Australia, under a Labor government, is prepared to contribute to both the Quad security dialogue and to the AUKUS trilateral security pact. Albanese and Wong share much in common with US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Their face-to-face meetings this week in Tokyo have the potential to reset the allies' approach to China and the Indo-Pacific well beyond what was likely or even possible under Donald Trump and Scott Morrison. One of the greatest challenges of our time is to reverse the slide in relations between China and the West. The stakes are immense, not just for defence and security, or trade and the economy, but also global responses to climate change, the future course of Chinese society and the lives of 1.4 billion people. Biden and Blinken will also be looking for signs that the new Albanese Labor government is as committed to AUKUS as was the Morrison government. The revelation last week that, contrary to expectations in Washington DC, Labor was not consulted about AUKUS, raised doubts about the functioning of the security pact. The operational details of how AUKUS could transform our immediate security environment have also not been fully spelt out. As with the Quad, the potential benefits, and threats, to Australia go well beyond hard-core defence and security issues. For decades, Australia's engagement with Asia has lacked the sustained investment of financial, political, and social capital that is needed. Albanese says he wants to change this, singling out Indonesia as a key priority for his government. Despite living on the edge of the largest and fastest-developing economies and societies on the planet, Australia has been far too lazy, short-sighted, and miserly about truly engaging with Asia. Our current woes with Chinese trade bans point to a failure to engage more broadly with both China and the rest of Asia. Under Penny Wong, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has the potential to play a critical role in securing Australia's broader security interests. Wong's personal backstory, as well as her formidable intellect, will be key assets in our engagement with Asia. The challenges facing the new defence minister — understood to be Richard Marles — intersect tightly with those facing Wong. The shocking invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the unexpected course of the war, contain many lessons for Australia. The first is the importance of international alliances and institutions, such as NATO and the European Union. Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it was easy to be critical of NATO and the EU, and question their utility and substance. Not any more. The Quad, AUKUS, ANZUS and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, together with ASEAN, are very different entities to NATO and the EU, but the war in Ukraine casts them in a fresh light. Diplomacy, trust and relationship-building are as critically important to defence and security as tanks, trucks and planes. Australia's next Defence White Paper, likely to be released in 2023, is going to be shaped by both the rise of China and the decline of Russia. The experiences of the war in Ukraine, the critical role of logistics, the utility of certain kinds of equipment such as tanks and the impact of organisational culture will be closely studied. In all of this, there are challenges as well as great opportunities for Australia. Already it is clear that intelligence, IT and drones have played a critical role in the defence of Ukraine. Australia has considerable capacity to innovate and develop related critical systems, hardware and technology to the benefit of both national and regional security. It should go without saying that Australia needs to both prepare for war and to do everything that it possibly can to avoid war. The latter depends very much on the former, together with diplomacy and relationship building. War, in the worst-case scenario, constitutes an existential threat. So too does climate change. The remarkable outcomes of the 2022 federal elections point to the realisation of millions of Australians that more frequent and severe fire, flood, drought and intense heat events represent an immediate security threat. The way Australians regard the two-party system has changed — for both sides of the aisle. Here are some of the factors that contributed to Saturday's election result. Neither the LNP nor Labor intended for this to be a climate election. But it clearly was. This was an instance of ordinary voters being well ahead of the leaders of the two larger parties. The impacts of climate change will contribute directly to political and social stability in our region. Crises in food and water security, rising sea levels and severe weather events and an increased impact of animal-to-human diseases such as COVID-19, mean that responses to climate change are integral to managing national and regional security. The nation and the region are watching and looking to the new Australian government for leadership on security and this includes climate change.

12,Labor's election result may once have triggered an existential crisis in the party. So where does that leave Albanese?,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes In any other decade, this would be a result that triggers talk of an existential crisis in the Labor Party. Instead, Anthony Albanese becomes the 31st Prime Minister on a primary vote lower than Bill Shorten's repeat electoral failure in 2019. Remarkably, the ALP is the first party to win government from Opposition with declining primary support. Albanese appears likely to secure a majority in his own right. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog And while this will allow Albanese to claim a modest mandate on climate action, an integrity commission and childcare, his Liberal opponents are left a shattered mob with whole pews of its moderate wing obliterated from its fabled broad church. Welcome to the new world of Australian politics, one that has a whole third dedicated to a panoply of crossbench priorities. It is likely that the 2022 election will go down as the moment the long-strained two-party system of government snapped. The election result heralds a permanent structural change to Parliament. The old parties cannot be assured of control anymore, even if it's been coming for a while. The Australian people have spoken, so how did it all unfold? The Greens have gnawed at the ALP's left flank for decades. They will at least triple their number in the 47th Parliament, taking down a moderate Liberal along the way. Now the teal independents have wreaked havoc on a generation of other moderate Liberals in an instant — snuffing out the Treasurer and presumptive Liberal-leader-in-waiting Josh Frydenberg. His defeat is a terrible blow to his party. Frydenberg (Kooyong), Trent Zimmerman (North Sydney), Dave Sharma (Wentworth) and Tim Wilson (Goldstein) have preached moderation but were punished for consistently voting alongside Barnaby Joyce and Matt ""net zero is dead"" Canavan. The company they kept has been catastrophic. No wonder senior Liberal Simon Birmingham indicated a preference for the Liberals to live apart from the Nationals for a period. Birmingham clearly wants the blue team to find its own bearings, on climate especially. Scott Morrison's burden is voters' emphatic rejection. After winning the ""miracle"" 2019 election, Morrison shaped the Liberal Party in his own likeness. Voters didn't like what they saw. Labor got exactly what it had been angling for all along: a referendum on Morrison. Morrison's stubbornness on integrity only fuelled Labor's concerted traducing of his character. But the PM was damaged goods even before the six-week campaign started. His brand was shop-soiled and worn in the withering glare of contrasting COVID-19 grievances. In Victoria — the Coalition's weakest state — antipathy for the Morrison government only strengthened when the PM and Frydenberg criticised Premier Dan Andrews's lockdown response in 2020 and 2021. Traumatised Victorians, already sensitive to their sacrifices, instinctively sided with their Premier. In Saturday's election, they registered their delayed protest. So, too, in Western Australia, where Morrison was severely penalised for siding with Clive Palmer in a High Court constitutional challenge on Labor Premier Mark McGowan's hard border. Nothing bristles West Australians more than presumed attacks on its secessionist spirit. They reacted brutally, with a 10.9 per cent swing to Labor, triple the national average. The Liberals have surrendered hallowed Liberal turf to the ALP in Perth. And if, as it appears, the conservatives lose Curtin to independent Kate Chaney, it has lost the Liberal crown jewels. Morrison's support for controversial captain's pick candidate Katherine Deves became a poison chalice elsewhere. The Deves factor doesn't explain the losses to the teal independents, but became a symptom of Morrison's problems countering the inner-city progressive mood. He sought to campaign on his economic record and failed to present an ambitious policy agenda. Some Liberals say this was neglect, particularly given Labor's attempted framing of the contest as a judgement on him. They wanted Morrison, instead, to audition for the next term. However, without a compelling agenda, and his public standing damaged, Morrison instead set about encouraging voter hesitation about Albanese. Albanese helped Morrison in that regard. The Labor leader had the poorer campaign, struggling with details, occasionally looking unassured. Some say he was underprepared, perhaps even complacent. Others in Labor say Albanese's always been more of a ""big picture"" guy. The son of a single mother, born into a life in public housing, Anthony Albanese has achieved his life-long wish of becoming Prime Minister. In any case, like Morrison, Albanese eschewed a grand policy agenda for fear of repeating Shorten's mistake in 2019. So it became a contest between the undeserving and the unimpressive, the unpopular against the unconvincing. Morrison lost on both counts. In a tussle between two men intent on energising enmity against the other, Albanese was judged the least-worst candidate. But one-third of voters' primary support went to ""others"". An indictment of the two major parties? Possibly. More likely a sign of a fractured electorate that has been steadily sinking the floor from underneath the Coalition and the ALP. In this environment, federal politics will change. The crash-or-crash-through mentality will not be rewarded in the long term when two-thirds of the nation does not necessarily see it your way. So parliament is at a crossroads, even if Albanese musters a majority government in coming days. That's because the Senate will need careful negotiation. A decent and authentic man, Albanese must now attempt to strike an agreement on policies where ambition varies: think climate action and integrity. The Greens, teals and other independents bring their own ideas on these fronts. Albanese says he'll be a consensus leader. And there's no doubt he masterfully handled minority government for Labor from 2010 to 2013. He must now show the many Australians who did not give him or the ALP their first vote that, collectively, the nation has chosen the right man at the right time.

13,The final warning for Morrison fell on deaf ears. Now women have voted him out,politics,"  Scott Morrison can't say he wasn't warned that women were angry. But will the next Liberal leader heed the lessons Morrison ignored? The history of human congress is littered with the stories of men who wake up to Dear John letters after years of not listening properly when the women in their lives say they're unhappy. But Scott Morrison – who received God knows how many final warnings from Australian women over the past year but chose every time to continue bulldozing happily along — seems to have achieved something novel, having unmistakably on Saturday night received a John Deere letter. Morrison's bulldozing ways are central to this upheaval in the political landscape and to the damage done to the Liberal Party. Much of central Melbourne has been purged of Liberal men, replaced significantly by members of the fastest-growing single demographic in Australia, which for some reason unknown to modern political science also was the group most consistently ignored and talked-down to by Scott Morrison: professional women. The rout in Melbourne claimed Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and high-profile  junior minister Tim Wilson. It sent Peter Costello's old seat of Higgins to Labor for the first time ever, and seriously threatened Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar. ""At least Alan Tudge survived. That's the important thing, I suppose,"" quipped one ashen-faced Liberal on Saturday night. Tudge (the question of whose membership or otherwise of the cabinet has now been firmly settled by the Australian people) suffered a primary vote swing against him in Aston of about 11 per cent, but will make it out of this parched Death Valley of disapproval on his hands and knees, surviving on a malodorous cocktail of One Nation, Clive Palmer and Liberal Democrats preferences. In NSW, Sydney Harbour now wears a teal collar: North Sydney, Warringah, Mackellar and (though it's close) possibly Wentworth too. Central Brisbane's gone Green. And in Western Australia, a staggering 11 per cent slump in the Coalition's primary vote was paid out lavishly to Labor — which collected Swan, Pearce and Hasluck. It ousted Scott Morrison's confidant Ben Morton, in ""safe"" Tangney, thanks to Labor candidate Sam Lim, a dolphin trainer who speaks 10 languages. And Julie Bishop's old seat of Curtin — another treasure once much squabbled-over by Liberal aspirants — now joins the teal ranks, in the hands of lawyer, consultant and mum-of-three Kate Chaney. ""Women did not see their concerns and interests reflected in a party led by Scott Morrison in coalition with Barnaby Joyce,"" said Julie Bishop on the Nine network on Saturday night. Well, the question has to be asked: Why? Scott Morrison, feted within his party as a tactical campaign genius, missed chance after chance to notice what was going on with Australian women. And it's not like it was that hard to spot. When COVID-19 hit, who was simultaneously the most likely to lose paid work and the most likely to take on more unpaid work? Women. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Who was more likely to work in the low-paid sectors of whom Australia asked so much in the pandemic — aged care workers, cleaners, teachers? Women. Child care was the first sector pulled off JobKeeper. Who works in child care centres? Women. Who did the lion's share of supervising children in lockdown, caring for elderly relatives, and coping with the explosion of anxiety and despair among adolescents? Metrics abound to confirm that it was women, again. But when Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg presented their first COVID Budget, where was it aimed? At construction and manufacturing, significantly; male dominated sectors that were less badly hit by COVID-19, but more generously helped. Then came the shock wave of Brittany Higgins's disclosure of her alleged experiences in Parliament House. Women's disgust at the culture of Australia's Parliament spilled over into the streets in protests around Australia. Morrison — after having to be nudged by his wife Jenny — expressed sympathy for Higgins, but later piously reminded the marchers how lucky they were to be living in a country where protesters were not shot. None of these instances of prime ministerial cloth-earedness is a hanging offence, of course. But people learn about their prime ministers by watching how they respond under pressure. And observers of Scott Morrison this term could not possibly have missed that here was a man happy to force out a female CEO for handing out $20,000 worth of watches to high-achieving executives, while enforcing no consequences at all for the chain of blokes (including himself) who managed to blow $1.8 billion AND ruin lives on the grotesquely mishandled Robodebt. Last March, amid the storm of revelations about parliamentary culture, Morrison staged a press conference at which he said he had been ""doing a lot of listening over this past month"". ""I have heard about being marginalised, women being intimidated, women being belittled, women being diminished, and women being objectified. That is not OK. ""Women who are afraid to walk to their car from the train, and they carry their keys in their hand like a knife for fear of being attacked. That is not OK. That is not acceptable. ""These events have triggered, right across this building and indeed right across the country, women who have put up with this rubbish and this crap for their entire lives, as their mothers did, as their grandmothers did."" Morrison said he was sympathetic to the idea of a quota for the preselection of women in the Liberal Party. And then: Nothing. Preselections in his own state of NSW, as you may recall, devolved into an ugly, venal, factional dirt-fight among (largely) Liberal Party men determined not to let each other get the upper hand. The result? Many seats where the Liberal Party didn't even select a candidate until the election (whose timing was, keep in mind, also set by the Prime Minister) in an epic act of rudeness and arrogance to voters in those seats. In Warringah, the hand-picked candidate was Katherine Deves, a woman whose crusade on trans women in sport was applauded by Scott Morrison, though he distanced himself from some of her more deranged remarks. To the extent that Morrison explicitly mentioned women during the campaign, it was often to support the defence of women's sport, as argued by Deves and by the Tasmanian Liberal Senator Claire Chandler, whose private members bill to exclude trans women from women's sport Morrison warmly supported. And fine: It's perfectly reasonable to discuss these matters. But for a prime minister who promised $150m last election for the ""Female Facilities And Water Safety Stream"" to build much-needed change rooms for women in venues where only the blokes have showers and toilets, and then blew 80 per cent of that money on swimming pools for 11 Liberal and National electorates, the sudden conviction that the real problem for sporting women is the potential of a trans teammate is — well, a lot. As the Prime Minister fanned out over Australia campaigning in his famously image-rich style, it became clear that he was doubling down on his decision to chase the bloke vote. An analysis by the Financial Review at the one-month mark established that Morrison heavily favoured manufacturing locations for photo opportunities. Fifteen of those, compared to seven community events. Anthony Albanese, on the other hand, favoured photo-ops with health and care workers. This may seem trivial — and the Labor leader had his fair share of high-vis too — but there is no accident in the planning of campaign visuals. We see what they want us to see, and Morrison wanted us to see him in high-vis. And of course women work in high-vis too, but not to the same extent that men do. To the external eye, it looked like a deliberate strategic gamble; that the PM believed he could afford to burn professional women (and possibly some leafy Liberal seats) because he'd capture blue-collar men in outer suburban areas. Liberal vote-druids briefed that ""the trans stuff"" was absolutely hoovering up votes in religious and socially conservative communities in Labor-held seats. Except that when the votes rolled in on Saturday night, there was very little evidence of anything of the kind. Is a nasty campaign tactic rendered even nastier by the fact that it didn't work? I don't know, but this little frolic — sponsored enthusiastically by Australia's 30th Prime Minister — was an exercise in profound awfulness. (Worth reflecting, too, on just who will be doing the emotional work now of reassuring the young people affected by this campaign stunt, telling them they're okay and that they are welcome to play sport. Who will be doing that stuff? You know the answer.) The truly astounding part of this story is that there were good things Scott Morrison could have said to women. He had more women in his Cabinet than ever before. They've committed billions to aged care and to child care, eventually, and made some valuable inroads to mental health and domestic violence services. He has some excellent female ministers, with whom he did not campaign enough. But when Morrison spoke every day at his press conferences — usually they come with an introductory piece of oratory about whatever is top of mind that day for the PM – he did not make any perceptible effort to address areas of interest to women. The air on Saturday night was thick and feathery with chickens coming home to roost. Seats with large numbers of Chinese-born voters, like Chisholm and Bennelong, swung hard against the government. Polling in the Chinese language Sydney Today suggested that Chinese-born Australians were not big fans of Defence Minister Peter Dutton's advice to Australians to ""prepare for war"". ACT Liberal Senator Zed Seselja — though counting continues — looks as though he might lose his seat, an unprecedented result surely related to the PM's airy promise last week to further fillet the public service. It cannot be a coincidence that the population of Western Australia — who Morrison last year dismissed as cave people because they secured the borders to their state — gave him an historic clubbing, with a swing of 11 per cent. When Leigh Sales asked Scott Morrison in the final week about the threat to the government in the ""teal"" seats, he replied in effect that voters in those seats were rich enough not to have to worry about real issues. ""Many of these places, I suppose, are less vulnerable to the impacts of the economy than, say, many of the places I've been in this campaign."" As we know, there's nothing women love more than a bloke telling them they don't know what they're talking about. The response on election night to these sentiments was unmistakeable. And Scott Morrison, just over a year after he declared himself open to a quota system, has presided over a campaign that cut the number of Liberal female MPs in the house of representatives from 13 to 6. It's difficult not to feel sorry for the departing Liberal women and for the Liberal moderates who lost their seats on Saturday night. They were punished for a set of circumstances not of their making. But I suspect every time Tim Wilson or Josh Frydenberg or Jason Falinski screamed about how much money their opponents were spending, or complained about how unfair it all was on them, or moaned that teal posters were being stuck up everywhere, it made things worse not better. And every time the teal independents were attacked as vacuous, or hypocritical, or hapless pawns of a powerful man, that made things worse too, because they likely reminded the professional woman listening of a time when things like that have been said about her. Those MPs were vulnerable because their party neglected for years to fix its relationship with women. And neglected for years to come to a sensible compromise on addressing climate change, rather than fighting like ferrets in a bag. And the overriding message of this campaign isn't really about Liberal or Labor. It's that local communities are tired of political bullshit. They don't want big parties to take their votes for granted — whether it's parachuting a high-profile external candidate in at the last minute, or refusing to do anything about aircraft noise (a powerful local issue that seems to have cost both the majors in the Queensland seats of Brisbane, Griffith, Ryan and Dickson). There's a massive lesson there to be learned. Are the right people listening?

14,Can you recycle corflutes?,politics,"  You can't have an election in Australia without tiny pencils, sausages and corflute. Corflute is a brand name so perhaps we should call it twin wall polypropylene substrate or corrugated plastic, but like Hoover and Rollerblade, the brand name has become the generic. For some people the major issue in any election is corflute. The questions and issues are perennial and are raised during local, state and federal polls. The substance is used by virtually all candidates. On a sign 600mm by 900mm, they will print their head shot, their party name, their seat and a slogan. During the campaign, these mini billboards will spread through our streets and suburbs like fake spider webs at Halloween. When the campaign starts, the corflute-a-phobic begin raising questions of timing and location: Are they allowed to be up now? How dare this person seek public office while flagrantly breaking the law! To whit, they have placed their head shot on a power pole. This is vile visual pollution and why should we then trust these vandals with anything else? By the campaign's end, the core coreflute-a-phobes have been joined by thousands more — the streets are full of these beaming signs of hope. But what happens to them after the last box is ticked and the last squirt of sauce hits the sausage? Is this just more landfill and litter? ABC Radio Sydney listeners told us of a thousand-and-one uses for expired election signage. One listener had a Malcolm Turnbull sign as a doormat just after he became PM. They saw it as both useful and a metaphor. The signs make great windscreen and car protectors during hailstorms and if that hailstorm breaks your roof tiles, there are some SES branches who keep a supply of old signs handy to plug the holes. They can be cut into thousand-piece jigsaws — just the gift for the political tragics in your life. Some use them as construction board for other puzzles. Many souvenir them and use them in their own campaigns and demonstrations. Cover the candidate with paint and inscribe your message on the blank side. They are repurposed in the family home in dozens of ways. If you have an open fire, place near the fire and put firewood on them. Careful though, they may be flammable. Many a floor of a chicken coop, rabbit hutch and guinea pig cage is lined with the head shot of one-time political aspirants. Whether you place this face up or face down will depend on your political leanings. You can also line your garage, kitchen cupboards and tool drawers with them. For those in cooler climes — perhaps Eden-Monaro, which includes the Snowy Mountains — they make excellent toboggans. The whole family can use them. Children's cubby houses, lemonade stands and musical instruments. One teacher said she can cut them into pieces and make pan-flutes out of them. She also bends them in half and uses them to display her students' art work. Cut out a giant photo frame for hilarious pics on your social media. Use the blank side as a canvas for budding Ben Quiltys. A concreter uses them for form work on small concrete pours. Ceramicists love them.

16,Who are the other four Labor ministers sworn in Monday?,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Anthony Albanese wasn't the only Labor member to be sworn into office on Monday — four of his colleagues and cabinet members were as well. Just after he was officially made Australia's 31st Prime Minister, some of the party's most senior members were also sworn into their roles, ahead of a full ministerial swearing-in in the coming weeks. The group was sworn in early because of the Quad leaders' meeting between Australia, Japan, India and the United States in Tokyo on Tuesday. While the full line-up of Labor's frontbench will likely be decided next week, here's who was also sworn into the ""interim ministry"", and what roles they've been given. Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles has, at least for the time being, been given the Employment portfolio. He will also be Acting Prime Minister while Mr Albanese is out of the country. The appointment is in line with his role in opposition as Shadow Minister for Employment, Skills and Small Business. But there are questions around his future in that role, with many believing he will instead choose to become Defence Minister. As deputy leader, he gets to choose what portfolio he takes on. In either role he faces some pretty tough issues — as Employment Minister he'll be responsible for maintaining low unemployment while also ensuring there are enough staff to fulfil some of Labor's key policies like more nurses in aged care. In Defence, he'd be overseeing a portfolio with one of the biggest budgets, submarine capability gaps and also have to tackle how to negotiate the threat of China to Australia and the region. Mr Marles was first elected to the seat of Corio in Victoria in 2007 and was briefly the Trade Minister for two months in 2013. Penny Wong has been sworn in as the Foreign Affairs Minister; she held the shadow portfolio in opposition for six years, since July 2016. Senator Wong is joining Mr Albanese on the trip to Tokyo in part to discuss Labor's major new package for the Pacific and South-East Asia, including major aid for the region. She and the Prime Minister have also flagged they want to discuss the threat climate change poses to Pacific nations. Senator Wong was first elected as a South Australian senator in 2001 and held the climate change and finance ministerial positions when Labor was last in government between 2007 and 2010. Jim Chalmers has been sworn in as Treasurer, another unsurprising choice given he has held the shadow treasurer role since the 2019 election and shadow finance portfolio before that. He will be responsible for delivering the first Labor budget in almost a decade once the government is officially formed, which could still be a little while away yet. According to Labor's costings, its budget bottom line will be $7.4 billion greater than the Coalition's, so the Treasurer will have to grapple with the already historic debt and deficit. Dr Chalmers was first elected to the Queensland seat of Rankin in 2013. Katy Gallagher was sworn in as Finance Minister, after holding the shadow finance minister position since 2019. She was also sworn in as Health Minister, Attorney-General and Minister for Women, but says these are just temporary as part of the interim portfolio. Along with Dr Chalmers, her role will be focused on how the government manages the economic situation left by the last government. Senator Gallagher was previously the ACT Chief Minister and made the jump to federal politics in 2016 to fill a senate vacancy. She was forced to resign from the position in 2018 for being a dual citizen but was re-elected as an ACT senator in 2019.

17,Josh Frydenberg concedes defeat in seat of Kooyong,politics,"  Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg has conceded defeat in the electorate of Kooyong in a video statement posted to his social media accounts. ""Today I rang Dr Monique Ryan to congratulate her on the election result in Kooyong and wished her well for the term ahead,"" he said. He said it was a ""privilege"" to serve the inner-Melbourne electorate for the past 12 years, and thanked the local community for ""their support and friendship"". ""I look forward to spending more time with my family,"" he said. Mr Frydenberg saw a swing of more than 10 per cent against him on a two-party preferred basis in the electorate. The loss marks the first time the seat has left Liberal hands since the party's inception in 1944, after previously being held by party leaders Robert Menzies and Andrew Peacock. The former treasurer refused to concede the seat on Sunday, initially opting to wait for an estimated 16,000 postal votes to be counted. In Victoria, the seats of Deakin and Macnamara remain in doubt as counting continues. The ABC has predicted the Liberal Party will now retain the seat of Menzies, with Keith Wolahan trumping Labor's Naomi Oakley. Incoming member Dr Ryan is one of 23 ""teal"" independents backed by a combination of grassroots support and the Climate 200 group. Dr Ryan told ABC Melbourne radio she was out in public when she received a call confirming her victory from Mr Frydenberg. ""It was respectful. Mr Frydenberg and I have waged a fairly willing campaign over the last few months, but it was nice to have received the call. I was grateful to him for calling me,"" Dr Ryan said. It brings an end to a tense election battle in the seat of Kooyong that saw tempers flare between the candidates. Dr Ryan criticised Mr Frydenberg during the election campaign after he publicly recounted a conversation with Dr Ryan's mother-in-law, who revealed she would be voting for the Liberal party and not her daughter-in-law. Mr Frydenberg's re-election campaign was also hampered by controversy, with Guide Dogs chief executive Karen Hayes stood down from her role after distributing pamphlets endorsing him. Dr Ryan attributed her win in Kooyong to changing demographics in the electorate, along with Mr Frydenberg's comments during the pandemic. ""The representative that they had was no longer reflecting their values, and that's why the people of Kooyong have looked elsewhere,"" she said. ""People were angry with Mr Frydenberg for the way that he spoke about Victoria during lockdown, and I don't think that he recognised the extent to which that stayed in their minds.""

18,'Shouldn't have been a change': McCormack says Coalition would have done better with him as deputy PM  ,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack has said the Coalition would have performed better in the federal election if he was the leader of the National party. Mr McCormack, the Member for Riverina, lost a leadership ballot to Barnaby Joyce last year and has repeatedly refused to rule out making another tilt at the leadership. ""There shouldn't have been a change of leadership of the National Party in June last year, there simply shouldn't have,"" Mr McCormack said. ""At the last election, the Nationals were all returned to their seats, and we had a couple of transitioning seats with incumbents retiring and new members coming in, and the votes were much higher last time than they were this time."" The Coalition's numbers were decimated by a rise of independents and the Greens in the lower house, but the Nationals have managed to retain all their seats, with the possible exception of Cowper which remains too close to call. Mr McCormack is yet to declare whether he will challenge Mr Joyce for the leadership but said he had been asked to. ""I have discussions with colleagues all the time, and some of them are wanting me to put my hand up,"" Mr McCormack said. ""I appreciate that some might have said only Barnaby Joyce would have got Hunter over the line. Well, he didn't."" The primary vote for some Nationals, including Mr McCormack, went backwards at this election, while others in seats like Clare and Mallee saw a boost in support. Mr Joyce praised the performance of the Nationals at the election, saying they outperformed their Coalition partners, the Liberal Party. ""Although there is a disappointment that the Coalition lost the election, the Nationals won every seat that they formally held, got within one step of two others, being Lingiari and Hunter, and even with three retirements and open seats, we won back those seats, and of course we picked up another senator,"" Mr Joyce said. Mr McCormack pointed to Mr Joyce's approach to climate change policy as one factor behind the loss of Coalition seats, saying he became a target for Labor, the Greens and teal independents. ""Certainly, no inner-city politicians or candidate was ever campaigning against Michael McCormack and using my name and discussing my integrity and reputation,"" Mr McCormack said. But when asked this morning whether his approach had impacted on the Coalition vote, he said there is a clear distinction between the Nationals and the Liberals. ""I'm not in the Liberal Party, I'm in the Nationals. It would be just the same to say I blame Tim Wilson for a loss of support in regional areas. People in inner-urban areas are not that stupid that they would realise the Nationals are not actually standing in those seats,"" Mr Joyce said. Nationals Senator Matt Canavan told Sky News on Sunday the Coalition suffered at the ballot box for adopting policies too far to the left. ""The electorate hasn't changed all that much in three years, but we did in the last three years. We adopted a Liberal moderate platform on energy, on climate, on the culture issues, and that platform has failed"" The member for Riverina, Mr McCormack said Mr Canavan's comments during the campaign were unhelpful, and that he disagrees with the senator's sentiment. ""There were very, very difficult times, and it was all well and good for Matt Canavan to say that net zero is dead during the election campaign,"" Mr McCormack said. ""That didn't help matters, and certainly didn't help matters in inner-city electorates."" ""It's all well and good to say one thing when you're in Gladstone, and one thing when you're down the back of a coal mine with coal dust all over your face, but you need to think about how that's going to be perceived in those inner-city electorates."" Mr McCormack said he was getting on with his job being the member for Riverina. ""I'm getting on with my job but, yes, the seat of Nationals leader will be vacant at our next party room meeting, and we'll see what happens.""

19,Finger-pointing among WA Liberals sparks warning party faces dire future after embracing 'fundamentalists',politics,"  The Liberal Party has lurched too far to the right in its embrace of religious “fundamentalists” and “will die as a party” without serious reform according to a WA Liberal veteran, as party stalwarts round on each other in the wake of a dismal federal election performance. Former federal cabinet minister Ken Wyatt, who lost his seat of Hasluck, condemned the party for being ""bloke centric"", while Liberal Party state president Richard Wilson promised a major overhaul of the way candidates were chosen. Former party leader Bill Hassell was scathing in his assessment of the party he led in WA in the 1980s, suggesting a dire future without major remedial action. ""If the recalcitrants in the Liberal Party are not prepared to get out of the way, or get out, we're going to die as a party, it's as serious as that,” Mr Hassell told ABC Radio Perth. Premier Mark McGowan also weighed in, dismissing the WA Liberals as a ""fringe group"". He said they were controlled by ""extremist factional powerbrokers"" — an allusion to ""The Clan"", an informal group of conservatives, including former federal finance minister and WA MP Matthias Cormann, upper house MPs Peter Collier and Nick Goiran, and Ian Goodenough, the incumbent federal MP in Moore whom the ABC computer predicts will narrowly retain his seat. Mr McGowan has refused to accept credit for Labor's strong showing in WA, instead attributing it largely to the Morrison government's decision to support Clive Palmer in his High Court challenge to the closed state border. ""It was a terrible decision… it was stupid,"" Mr McGowan said. ""Join with Clive Palmer — what were they thinking, why would they do that?"" Former Morrison minister Michaelia Cash was today joined by Mr Wilson in blaming the decision to join that High Court bid squarely on retired WA federal MPs Christian Porter and Mr Cormann. ""It proved to be the wrong decision, that's absolutely true,"" Mr Wilson said today. Mr McGowan's assessment was that if former Prime Minister Scott Morrison had listened to WA Liberals opposed to joining Mr Palmer, the election result in WA may not have been so disastrous. ""I suspect if the Prime Minister and Mr Porter had listened to them it might have been a bit of a different outcome here,"" Mr McGowan said. The Liberals lost the Perth metropolitan seats of Swan, Pearce, Hasluck and Tangney, while its been a tight race in the formerly safe Liberal seat of Moore, where Mr Goodenough is slightly ahead. They also appear to have lost the heartland blue-ribbon seat of Curtin to independent Kate Chaney. It comes after the state Liberals were almost wiped out after the last state election, when they were left with only two seats in the lower house. Senior WA Liberal and former Morrison cabinet minister Ken Wyatt, who had been the member for Hasluck, recounted people telling him on the day of the federal election they wanted to vote for him but could not because of his party's ""mindset"", particularly on climate change and women. In the space of five years, the WA electorate has delivered three incredibly emphatic rejections of Liberals in the state. ""I had a young woman saying to me 'your party needs to do something about women, including having more women in politics',"" Mr Wyatt told ABC Radio Perth. Asked about what the WA Liberal Party needed to do after its loss of so many seats in WA, he said the party had to act on the review conducted after the state election loss. ""WA needs some serious soul searching,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be bloke-centric like we've been in the past."" Mr Wilson promised party members would have a greater say in preselections in the future. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog ""We need the best possible candidates to be placed in our seats in the elections of 2025, both state and federal, and that means we've got to overhaul top to bottom the way we select candidates,"" he told ABC Radio Perth. ""And I expect that if people on our state executive or our state council don't believe that reform is necessary, I'd expect them to consider their positions on those bodies because I think we've been sent a pretty clear message now."" Mr Hassell said the party had received three recent messages at the ballot box in WA but had not been listening and had failed to implement any real change. ""We need action, we need very strong action, and we need very strong leadership,"" he said. He said the party had lurched too far to the right. ""Fundamentalists, whether they're Christian or Muslim or any other, are dangerous people because they don't want to live in the community according to general community standards,"" he said. ""They want to impose their particular belief system and philosophies on all of us, and that's one of the problems in the Liberal Party – what we call the religious right. ""I think they are … seriously misguided"" He said MPs should not interfere in the endorsement process ""because it's been politicians interfering that has reduced us to this rump."" ""We've lost the crown jewels. To lose Tangney, to lose Curtin is just wrong, wrong,"" he said. ""The only way it will be righted is if we have root and branch reforms.""

20,Voters send 'unequivocal' message on climate change as Liberals look set to retain Sturt,politics,"  James Stevens set to retain seat of Sturt as voters send 'unequivocal' message to Liberal Party The Liberals' James Stevens, who looks set to retain the South Australian seat of Sturt, says his party has been sent a clear message voters want action on climate change. Mr Stevens is the incumbent for the eastern Adelaide suburbs seat, which is usually considered a safe Liberal seat. He said while he was still not yet confident to claim victory over Labor's Sonja Baram, postal votes were so far in his favour. ""At this stage I'm getting a strong return on the postals, about 58 per cent of the postals are coming my way,"" he said. ""I might end up winning by 1,500 or 2,000 votes, but it is a very significant message that's being sent to me and the Liberal Party on the weekend in Sturt, as is the case across the country."" Mr Stevens said voters in Sturt had turned their backs on the major parties, favouring the Greens in what he saw as a clear call for action on climate change. ""Liberals [voters] chose the Greens as an option on Saturday, I think in most cases to send a message, I don't think they wanted to move to the Labor Party otherwise they would have voted for the Labor Party, but I think they felt that the Liberal Party was failing to understand their genuine concerns on climate change action in particular,"" he told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""That wasn't just the case in Sturt ... I might have been lucky enough to survive, unfortunately most others [in similar seats] haven't, but the message is unequivocal."" Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Mr Stevens said the Liberal Party had failed to make clear to voters what it had already achieved on climate change. ""I think we had followed a difficult path towards making our commitment to net zero by 2050 and that lost a lot of the capital and value we should have got from that important milestone decision that we made,"" he said. ""We were doing a lot more than people understood we were doing, but also I don't think it was enough."" He said a shift in attitude would be the only way to win voters back, and the party now needed to focus on holding the Albanese government to account. ""The Liberal Party is a party that should aspire to always be running our country, winning elections and being in government and if we're not prepared to listen to what people in seats like Sturt want then we won't be in government,"" he said. ""I think it's a very straightforward situation for us and I think we need to make sure the debate isn't about whether or not we need to deal with climate change, but whose approach is better."" South Australian Liberal Senator Simon Birmingham agreed the Liberal Party had to shift its attitude and take further action on climate change. ""If we continue down a pathway where people believe we are not genuine about action on climate change – and that is the real challenge there – that even with the work that was done to achieve a commitment a net zero , the process of getting there was so messy and so untidy and had opponents within the Coalition speaking out against it that people didn't think we were genuine in pursuing that commitment,"" he said. ""We absolutely need to make sure that we work to build a majority of support on issues that matter to Australians and environment, environmental management, climate change do matter, they need to be handled responsibly and not sacrifice jobs and business and industry across the country."" Greens candidate Professor Barbara Pocock looks set to gain a seat in the Senate, doubling the number of South Australian Greens senators. Professor Pocock said South Australia was part ""of what is a very significant shift across our country"". ""It is a vote for climate action, it is very clear ... it is a catastrophic vote for the conservative side of politics who have disappointed so many people. ""The conversation so much is about the disappointment of the last decade."" She said it was a misconception that action on climate change and a strong economy were mutually exclusive. ""It's a big mistake to pose those two things as opposites of each other,"" she said. ""If we don't embrace the renewable revolution, we are already part of it here in this state of course we are leading in our country, then we will cost jobs of the future. ""Young people understand that, many people see it and they want us to embrace even more quickly things like electric vehicles [and] green technology, which will expand our manufacturing.""

21,ASX edges higher as new Labor PM Albanese sworn in and global equity markets rebound,politics,"  ASX edges higher as new Labor PM Albanese sworn in and global equity markets rebound Australian shares have finished the day slightly higher, while Labor Party leader Anthony Albanese was sworn in as the country's 31st prime minister after nine years of rule by the conservative Coalition. ASX 200 closed up 0.1 per cent to 7,149. The All Ordinaries gained 8 points or 0.1 per cent to 7,399. Mr Albanese promised a ""journey of change"" as he vowed to tackle climate change, rising living costs and inequality. On the share market, miners climbed 0.8 per cent and touched a more-than-two-week high after iron ore prices surged on Friday. BHP Group, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group rose between 1.1 per cent and 2.8 per cent. Incitec Pivot was down 3.7 per cent after surging as much as 7.5 per cent when the fertiliser maker said it would spin off its explosives manufacturing and fertilisers businesses. Energy stocks added 0.3 per cent, benefiting from strong oil prices. Major oil and gas explorers Woodside and Santos gained 0.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively. Domestic technology stocks were up 0.4 per cent, despite Wall Street's weak finish last week. Block tumbled 2.4 per cent, while WiseTech Global gained 0.6 per cent. Financials shed 0.4 per cent, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group falling 0.1 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively. Among the top movers up were Codan (+14.5 per cent), Imugene (+12.5pc), Elders (+9.6 per cent) and A2 Milk (+3.5 per cent). The Australian dollar was also up, at 71.05 US cents at 04:27pm AEST. Global equity markets rebounded on Friday after the S&P 500 pared losses that briefly took it into bear market territory. China cut its prime rate for five-year loans, which influences mortgage prices, by 15 basis points in a reduction that was sharper than expected as authorities seek to cushion the impact of an economic slowdown. While a late-day rally on Friday stopped the S&P 500 from confirming a bear market, the gloom on Wall Street led the benchmark to fall for the seventh consecutive week, an event that has occurred only five times since 1928, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. How long the downdraft in equities lasts will depend on when inflation breaks, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""What really flummoxed investors this week, myself included, is when you have the types of companies that typically do well in economic softness, do terribly,"" Mr Tuz said, referring to poor earnings results at Walmart and Target. The S&P 500 closed up 0.01 per cent after being down 2.27 per cent at one point or below the level would confirm a bear market — a 20 per cent decline from its January 3 record closing high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.03 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite already in bear territory, fell 0.3 per cent. Equity valuations need to come down and the expected return on investments, the discount rate, needs to go up, said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Hermes. ""The market is starting to digest the idea that this might be a new world where the discount rate on risk assets is not zero anymore,"" Mr Auth said. ""You're seeing all these different areas of the market get pounded at the same time and it's just been very unsettling for investors,"" he added. MSCI's gauge of stocks in 47 countries closed up 0.37 per cent, but still fell for the seventh consecutive week, its longest losing streak since the index was launched in 1990. Earlier in Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index rose 0.73 per cent. US Treasury yields fell for a third straight session on concerns about growth prospects. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes fell 6.5 basis points, to 2.79 per cent. Gold edged up, heading for its first week of gains in five weeks on persistent worries over economic growth and the dollar's decline over the week. Oil prices steadied, on course for little change for the week as a planned European Union ban on Russian oil balanced concerns that slowing economic growth would hurt demand. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US112.91 a barrel, by 10:36am AEST.

22,Labor needs just three more seats to form majority government. These are the seats still in doubt,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Nine seats remain in doubt as vote counting continues after Saturday's election. With Labor needing three more seats to form a majority government, there's a lot riding on them. The Labor Party currently has 73 lower house seats and needs to get to 76 to govern without the help of crossbenchers. Of the nine seats that remain in doubt, Labor is projected to be ahead or considered likely to win in four of them. Workers for the Australian Electoral Commission have been furiously sorting and counting votes since polls closed at 6pm on Saturday. But there is a mountain of postal votes to sort through, and many of these will take up to two weeks to arrive to be counted. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog These postal votes could be important in determining the outcome in some of the extremely close seats below. This is how what things are looking on a national level at the moment. Here is the breakdown of the seats still in doubt. While this seat is still in doubt, the incumbent Bridget Archer appears to be the likely winner at this stage. And, despite her slim margin, Ms Archer says she is considering putting her hand up to become the next leader or deputy leader of the Liberal Party. ""I think I'll just have to wait until the party room meets to see what the final make-up is of the party room, talk to some colleagues and things like that,"" Ms Archer says. Liberal Trevor Evans is the current member for Brisbane. The one thing we can say is that he has not won his seat back, says Briggs. What is not settled is whether the Green or the Labor Party will win it. At the moment it looks like the seat will be decided on preferences. ""Some of the postals look to be favouring Labor. Absent votes in that seat look to be favouring the Greens,"" Briggs says. ""I think that this is one that we're going to be waiting a long time to know the results of. ""It's on the left of politics. Which party holds it? We don't know."" The Mid North Coast remains in doubt, with current Nationals member Pat Conaghan leading independent Caz Heise. The Nationals have seen a 9.1 per cent swing away from them. Cowper is set to remain in doubt until a better preference count is available. A postal vote preference count arrived yesterday, which gave 66.5 per cent to Ms Heise and 33.5 per cent to Mr Conaghan, significantly narrowing the estimated margin. The seat has been held for all but two years by the National Party since Federation. The seat of outgoing Liberal Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar is still too close to call. There is a projected 5.5 per cent swing against Mr Sukkar at this stage. But Briggs says the result is line-ball with 70 per cent of votes counted. ""This one is a really close one that we're going to have to see some more votes on,"" he says. ""Labor's ahead on the count that we've got at the moment but it's 50.7 per cent to 49.3. ""There's some early votes that are yet to come in and we don't really have many postal votes anywhere yet. We may get some more clarity on where that's going today."" Gilmore has bucked the trend federally with a 2.8 per cent overall swing towards the Liberal Party. Former NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance is ahead of current Labor MP Fiona Phillips. The Liberals have picked up a 4.5 per cent swing towards them, with Susie Bower leading on first preference votes. But this is a very close-run battle that is yet to be called. ""Now, I'm not going to say this one is falling Labor's way yet. I think it's a close-run battle,"" Briggs says. ""We think Labor is ahead but they've suffered a swing against them in Lyons there."" The Greens still have a path to victory in this seat. But Briggs says it seems more likely that Labor could take it. ""Josh Burns pulled a little ahead. You would favour him. But the Greens have done well,"" he says. Although Mandy Nolan was leading early in the vote count, current Labor MP Justine Elliot has taken the lead. Briggs says he considers Ms Elliot the favourite to win the seat. ""If Justine can stay ahead, she would be favourite,"" he says. Liberal candidate for Sturt James Stevens says he hopes to retain his eastern Adelaide seat. Labor's Sonja Baram is just behind Mr Stevens, with a 6.5 per cent swing against the Liberals. Mr Stevens says there is a challenge ahead for the party to re-engage with voters it has lost. ""About 56 per cent of postals are coming my way, so that's largely the votes to count, so if that trend remains, I might end up winning by 1,500 or 2,000 votes.""

23,"Liberals hurt by move to back challenge against WA hard border, Michaelia Cash concedes",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Senior West Australian Liberal Michaelia Cash has said she did not agree with the federal government's support of Clive Palmer's legal challenge to WA's hard border, conceding it contributed to the party's disastrous election result. Senator Cash made the comments after Labor won a majority of WA's federal seats for the first time this century. ""The decision was made at the time because of legal reasons,"" she said. ""The feedback that both Ben Morton and I had given at the time [was] we did not support the challenge. ""In the end, after consulting with Premier [Mark] McGowan, the Prime Minister understood that we needed to back Western Australia and we withdrew from the challenge. ""Certainly that initial decision, to back Clive Palmer, even though we reversed it, meant that the Labor Party was able to run an effective campaign against us, a very strong campaign."" Mr Morton's loss in the seat of Tangney, previously considered safe Liberal territory, was one of several shock results in WA. The WA electorate has issued three emphatic rejections of the Liberals in five years. The clock is ticking for them to turn things around, writes Jacob Kagi. Senator Cash believed the popularity of the Premier was key. ""The vote was clear, Western Australians very much supported the approach of Mark McGowan,"" she said. Senator Cash said WA had gone its own way through the COVID-19 pandemic, giving the state a different perspective on politics. ""We were able to do it differently in Western Australia,"" she said. ""We were able to close the border and keep everybody else out and in doing that, we lived a life that really, across Australia, no one else lived."" In 2021, Scott Morrison appeared to liken West Australians to cave dwellers, referring to the film The Croods and saying, ""we can't stay in the cave"". ""That was not what he was saying at the time,"" Senator Cash maintained. ""What he was saying was there was a light at the end of the tunnel."" Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Senator Cash insisted Mr Morrison ""was actually a great friend to Western Australia and that was evident in relation to getting us our fair share of GST"". ""On any analysis, that was one of the greatest things our government did,"" she said of the 2018 move to set a 70-cents-in-the-dollar floor on the amount of GST revenue a state could receive."" She said the swing to Labor could also be attributed to ""a true structural change in the way politics works in Australia"". Senator Cash said the WA seat of Curtin was always going to be ""very, very tight"", and reiterated that the so-called teal candidates were not necessarily independents, but a coordinated group of people. ""What we have seen is the Liberal Party vote has transferred, in many cases, to those independents,"" she said. ""Those inner-city seats, here it's in Curtin, you see them in New South Wales, you've seen in it Brisbane, you've seen it in Victoria. ""They're not going Labor, they are going teal."" She said the vote was also changing in outer-city seats, which used to be Labor territory. Senator Cash maintained the Liberals had run a good campaign in WA and would now seek a new beginning. ""The rebuilding process has well and truly started in the Western Australian Liberal Party,"" she said. Ken Wyatt, who lost Hasluck, said he believed the major parties had lost touch with families. ""That's why we've had so many independents come through,"" he said. ""Because they are speaking about the issues that families want addressed and parties are not immovable bodies, but they've just got to listen more, engage more. ""It's about being out there, talking to people every single chance that you get."" The former Indigenous affairs minister said he was ""not really"" disappointed over his loss. ""I have no regrets,"" he said. ""I have enjoyed every moment and I am pleased to leave a legacy for Indigenous Australians. ""We now have seven to nine members and that's an incredible shift in Australia's history."" Mr Wyatt said he had aspirations for the Indigenous Voice to be enshrined in legislation with a view to constitutional recognition, and he would have ""loved"" to have finished that work. He said having state parliaments reporting on Closing the Gap targets, and fostering Aboriginal economic development, were among his achievements.

24,Bridget Archer considering tilt for spot on Liberal leadership team,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Outspoken Tasmanian MP Bridget Archer says she is considering putting her hand up to become the next leader or deputy leader of the Liberal Party. Ms Archer — who is considered likely to retain her difficult-to-win seat of Bass — will be one of few moderate voices left in the party room after formerly blue seats like Kooyong and Goldstein were won by so-called teal independents. Asked on ABC Radio Hobart whether she would throw her hat in the ring for a leadership role, Ms Archer said she ""certainly will give it some consideration"". ""I think I'll just have to wait until the party room meets to see what the final make-up is of the party room, talk to some colleagues and things like that,"" Ms Archer said. ""I care about where we go to next. I care that we do learn some lessons from this and return to the best interests of Australians and put ideological considerations aside … I will do everything I can to fight to ensure it remains the Liberal Party."" Liberal MPs Karen Andrews and Dan Tehan have also suggested they may put their hands up for the top job, as has conservative Peter Dutton. Since Saturday, Ms Archer repeatedly said she and her constituents were sick of tribal, divisive politics. ""I think what Australians want and certainly what people in my community want is a return to representation, a return to representatives listening to their community and working together to achieve outcomes in the best interests of Australians,"" she told ABC Hobart. Ms Archer was George Town mayor before entering the federal parliament. Veteran Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz, who is fighting to retain his seat, told ABC Radio Hobart he believed it too early for Ms Archer to take on a leadership role, but talked up Braddon MP Gavin Pearce's chances of securing a shadow ministry. Mr Pearce and Ms Archer were both first elected in 2019. If Ms Archer does retain her seat, she will be only the second sitting MP re-elected in Bass in almost three decades. Her campaign centred on her personality and record, pivoting in the final week to purple signage without Liberal branding and the slogan ""Keep Bridget in Bass"". During her first term in parliament, she spoke against her party's policy on cashless welfare cards and twice crossed the floor — once in support of a national integrity commission, then during debate on religious discrimination out of concern for transgender children. Her comments came as Labor leader Anthony Albanese was sworn in as prime minister after the Liberals were swept from power in the election over the weekend. The Liberal Party's greatest losses came thanks to teal independents — women who wiped out moderate Liberals from once-safe seats in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. Incoming teal independents Monique Ryan, who defeated former deputy leader Josh Frydenberg, Zoe Daniel, who defeated Tim Wilson, and Allegra Spender, who defeated Dave Sharma, have said they want the incoming government to take greater steps to address climate change.

25,Liberal strongholds no more as country voters take out their frustrations on 'complacent' politicians ,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Two of the safest Liberal seats in Australia have become marginal for the first time in recent history, surprising people in regional Western Australia who feared their votes would not matter. Political analysts say the fall in the Liberal Party's primary vote reflected ""complacency"" among incumbent MPs and sentiment among traditional voters that they were being ""taken for granted"". The healthy margins held by former Morrison government cabinet minister Melissa Price and assistant minister Nola Marino in the seats of Durack and Forrest were slashed to under six per cent. In O'Connor, Rick Wilson also battled huge swings to Labor to see his 15.4 per cent margin drop below nine per cent. All three politicians have been in office for a combined 33 years and have been elected for another term. Many regional residents told the ABC on polling day they felt frustrated living in safe seats. Voters in Durack, Australia's largest seat by area, complained of feeling overlooked and forgotten throughout the campaign. Election promises in the bush were minimal and there were no high-profile visits from either major party during the campaign. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Jodie Lucas and Derek Stoney have lived in Karratha for 14 years and treated voting in Durack as a formality on Saturday. ""As long as my name gets marked off I'm all good,"" Ms Lucas said. ""I just feel they already know who is going to win before we vote."" Ms Lucas said many of her friends felt the same. ""That's what they all think. Why vote? It doesn't matter anyway,"" she said. Geraldton resident Jonelle Green said there was a sense of great apathy in a safe seat. ""A number of people have said, 'Oh, I don't vote. I have never voted' and I am, like, maybe that is part of the problem,"" she said. Karratha residents Harry and Maddy said issues like healthcare mattered to them but admitted they had not paid much attention to the election campaign. ""I feel like I’m such a small piece in such a big movement that it's just not going to make much of a difference,"" Maddy said. But Melissa Price rejected suggestions voters in Durack – the fourth most conservative seat in the country – felt they had been taken for granted during the campaign. ""They [seats] are only safe because you work hard,"" Ms Price said. ""I have never believed that, because you are considered to be a safe seat, that you don't get as much attention."" In WA's south, the Liberal Party has held Forrest since 1972 and some voters grappled with similar issues as they cast their votes on Saturday. Charlie Nadin said he wanted more attention paid to his electorate. ""It's irritating. It feels like a waste of a vote, sadly,"" he said. Mr Nadin said the provision of healthcare and affordability of housing were issues that he felt were not being adequately addressed in his seat. ""If you're a federal member, you should be pushing for these things for Bunbury and the Forrest region and I haven't seen any evidence of that,"" he said. Fellow Bunbury resident Maria Samantela's frustration almost stopped her heading to the polls on election day. ""We were like, who's going to look after the kids? We'll just stay here and not vote and just pay for the penalty,"" she said ""There's no point for us."" Forrest MP Nola Marino hit back at the suggestion politicians could become complacent in long-held safe seats. Ms Marino made just two election pledges during the campaign — for improved childcare and mental health facilities —  the same number as her unsuccessful Labor challenger, Bronwen English. ""You never ever take one day for granted in this role,"" she said. ""I respect the decisions that people make, that's what our democracy is about."" Ms Marino said she would work ""very hard"" to continue to represent her electorate but abruptly ended her interview with the ABC when asked what she could offer in opposition. Political commentator Peter Kennedy said winning a fourth consecutive term of government was always going to be difficult for the Liberal Party. ""A little element of complacency has crept in in taking traditional supporters for granted,"" Mr Kennedy said. ""Seats like Durack and O'Connor really seem to be Liberal Party heartland and as safe as a bank, as it were. ""In that regard, all candidates can sort of take things for granted … if voters feel like they're being taken for granted, they look elsewhere and that's what they've done."" Mr Kennedy said the seats of Durack and Forrest were now in play for both major parties at the next election. ""There could well be a huge battle between the major parties now for those seats,"" he said. ""Labor might think, well, they could be within reach. ""If the new government thinks they've got a chance of winning those seats, then they'll get more attention."" WA politics lecturer Martin Drum said voters in safe seats would always miss out, compared to hotly contested electorates. ""Your political leaders will spend most of their time trying to cover the marginal seats and win voters over there … and the safer seats just don't get the attention,"" he said. ""There's a lot less opportunity to get your pet project supported if you're a local member or candidate in the seat of Forrest."" Rick Wilson made no apology for that strategy. ""Resources have to be spent on the seats that you need to win or you need to hold,"" the sitting MP said. ""So no, I don't have any problem with more resources or more effort going into those seats because, on the flip side, the Labor Party didn't put a huge amount of resources into my seat either. ""Part and parcel of being a member of a party and you know being a team player, is that those resources if they're needed to be spent in other seats, that's where they should be spent."" In Mr Wilson's seat, truck driver Caleb Truscott said he had not been impressed by election promises from any of the candidates. ""They all seem to be chucking in the same amount of money … I drive around enough to see all the roadworks that get done … it's not enough."" But Mr Truscott said it was voters in control in safe seats. ""I guess it means [the Coalition] are doing a good job if everyone keeps electing them,"" he said. A spokesman for the WA Liberal Party told the ABC a review of election results would be conducted in the weeks ahead, including all regional seats.

26,How an 'outdated association with criminality' is leaving tattoo studios facing closure,politics,"  Insurance premiums for tattoo shops leaving businesses facing the prospect of closure For the past eight years, a tattoo studio has occupied 205 Brisbane Street in Ipswich, but that's about to change. Family-owned business Compass Tattoo will shut its doors in six months' time, with nowhere to go. A recent change in their landlord's insurance has forced their eviction, creating a frightening ultimatum: pay $30,000 a year — on top of their normal expenses — to keep their prime spot or get out. ""Our landlord has come to us and said the only way they can renew our lease is if we take on a pretty substantial landlord insurance bill,"" co-owner of the studio Angela Nayler said. ""His insurance every year is around $11,000 for the building. This year, if he keeps Compass Tattoo as a tenant, he's looking at around $41,000."" The mother of three said it's a bill the business simply cannot afford. ""He wants to keep us on. He's tried over 20 insurance companies and they all say the same thing — they won't insure him if there's a tattoo store in the building, because we're classed as high risk,"" she said. ""There are only a few [insurers] in Australia who will cover us, and they're able to push up prices as much as they like."" Ms Nayler said she had contacted over a dozen other insurers in a desperate search for an explanation for why tattoo studios were classed as high risk. She said a broker at Shield Insurance told her many insurers would not cover tattoo parlours ""due to gang affiliation and all of those sorts of things"". In a statement, Shield Insurance said ""insurers generally relay broad feedback such as it being outside of their underwriting scope, due to the high risk of the activity."" ""Gallagher Insurance has a facility for tattoo artists and to my knowledge this is the only option in-market."" Arthur J Gallagher insurance has been contacted for comment. An Insurance Council of Australia spokesman said capital is harder to come by so insurers' risk appetites are lower. ""Each insurer bases the offering of a premium on their claims experience,"" a spokesman said. ""An increase in claims activity in a segment can lead to an increase in premiums for that segment, or the insurer choosing not to offer insurance to that segment at all."" Matthew Sullivan from Eternal Mark Tattoo in Gympie said he had been made to feel like a criminal, despite having never been behind bars or committing a crime. ""I don't feel like I fall under the category of [an artist] or anything like that,"" he said. ""I'm basically put in the category of outlaw motorcycle member even though I'm not."" His rent has doubled this year after his landlord copped an insurance price hike of $16,000 because he had a tattooist as a tenant. ""We've gone from having an insurance premium of $4,000 to like over $20,000,"" he said. ""I have to pass the extra cost to the customer."" He said he feared the extra cost on top of his other expenses could put him out of business. ""Some days I feel like shutting the doors because I'm copping all these extra payments and I'm just like what's the worth?"" Mr Sullivan said. ""Something's got to change otherwise we're going to see a lot more small businesses shut down."" Australian Tattooist Guild president Alex Cairns said it was a ""common"" issue nationwide. ""Almost every tattoo shop owner that I've spoken to in the last two years has the same problem,"" he said. He said the industry had moved beyond its dark past with organised crime. ""I think there's an outdated association with an element of criminality,"" he said. ""That's a couple of decades out of date."" In order for tattooists to be licensed, they have to undergo strict background checks, including fingerprinting in both Queensland and New South Wales. ""You'd be pretty hard pressed to find examples where there was [links to organised crime]."" Red Hill building owner Samantha Morrison made the decision to evict her ""loyal"" tattooist tenant after she received an updated building insurance bill for an additional $10,000. ""We're losing the best tenant that we've ever had,"" she said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. Ms Morrison said when she questioned the price hike with her insurance company she was told it was because of the tattoo parlour. ""[They] mentioned Molotov cocktails, bombings,"" she said. ""It's unfair, it's discriminatory. ""Our tenant has no affiliates whatsoever — not even a parking ticket in his criminal history. ""I don't think this is beneficial for anyone except the people who are getting paid big commissions and throwing these bogus charges on poor little mum-and-dad businesses.""

27,"'Incredible privilege': Frydenberg thanks Kooyong, Monique Ryan says pandemic comments cost former treasurer — as it happened",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Dr Monique Ryan has thanked a ""respectful"" Josh Frydenberg after he conceded the race for the seat of Kooyong. The former treasurer has described the last 12 years as ""an incredible privelege"". Catch up on Monday's updates as they happened in our blog. By Michael Doyle We are wrapping up our federal politics blog for today. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg has conceded Kooyong, while many in the Liberal Party say change is needed after their defeat. Thank-you for joining us on the blog throughout the day. Goodbye for now. By Michael Doyle The spouse of the prime minister of Australia generally assists the prime minister with ceremonial duties, campaign events and various other responsibilities. And while Anthony Albanese's partner, Jodie Haydon, is preparing to take on these responsibilities, she's also gearing up to challenge the traditional, often stereotypical role of Australia's first lady. As she prepares to take on the high-profile role, Haydon will soon share the same experiences of the first ladies that came before her: living under a microscope. Read more of Angelica Silva's piece on Jodie Haydon here. By Michael Doyle Independent candidate Monique Ryan has thanked former treasurer Josh Frydenberg for his concession of the seat of Kooyong. The loss marks the first time the seat has left Liberal hands since the party's inception in 1944, after previously being held by party leaders Robert Menzies and Andrew Peacock. Incoming member Dr Ryan is one of 23 ""teal"" independents backed by a combination of grassroots support and the Climate 200 group. Dr Ryan told ABC Melbourne radio she was out in public when she received a call confirming her victory from Mr Frydenberg. ""It was respectful. Mr Frydenberg and I have waged a fairly willing campaign over the last few months, but it was nice to have received the call. I was grateful to him for calling me,"" Dr Ryan said. It brings an end to a tense election battle in the seat of Kooyong that saw tempers flare between the candidates. Dr Ryan attributed her win in Kooyong to changing demographics in the electorate, along with Mr Frydenberg's comments during the pandemic. ""The representative that they had was no longer reflecting their values, and that's why the people of Kooyong have looked elsewhere,"" she said. ""People were angry with Mr Frydenberg for the way that he spoke about Victoria during lockdown, and I don't think that he recognised the extent to which that stayed in their minds."" By Michael Doyle Outgoing resources minister Keith Pitt says his party has held up its end of the Coalition deal by retaining all its seats as he launches into his first term in opposition. ""My job will be there fighting for the things that matter, and it will be a very public fight,"" he said. He said the fundamentals would be the same. ""It is about, for the people I represent, cost of living and what they can afford, having a roof over their heads, making sure your job is there next week,"" he said. Mr Pitt said the Nationals took no responsibility for the Coalition's thumping election loss. He said the campaign was unlike any other he had experienced. ""To be honest it's been a pretty tough one. In terms of the campaign tactics from others, I've never seen this before,"" he said. Reporting by Lucy Loram and Scott Lamond By Michael Doyle As of this moment, Labor was yet to reach the 76 seats needed to form government. If it falls short, it will need the support of the crossbench to pass legislation in the House of Representatives. To be sworn in as Prime Minister, Governor-General David Hurley needed to be convinced that Mr Albanese would be able to govern in some form. The election results have shown that Labor was the only major party that would be able to govern — either in majority or minority. If the results had been closer and it was clear there would be a hung parliament, but no clarity around which party would secure the support of the crossbench to form government, then the Governor-General would not have agreed to swear in Mr Albanese or Scott Morrison. Mr Albanese has already received confidence and supply from crossbenchers Rebekha Sharkie, Bob Katter, Andrew Wilkie, Helen Haines and Zali Steggall. The Governor-General has to have confidence that whoever becomes prime minister will be able to maintain a stable government, whether that's with the support of the crossbench or not. He also would have received legal advice before the swearing-in to make sure it was the right decision. Usually, there would not be the kind of rush there is this time around, but the Quad leaders meeting in Tokyo has meant the process has had to be expedited. By political correspondent Brett Worthington By Michael Doyle Jenny Morrison arrived at Kirribilli House this afternoon in a car, as the family prepare to move out of the PM's Sydney residence. Ms Morrison didn't speak to media after pulling up in the driveway and entering the property. The Lodge, in Canberra, has historically been the official residence for Australian prime ministers and their families. While Mr Morrison would stay there when he was in the capital, he and his family primarily lived at Kirribilli House. By Michael Doyle Hello my friend. The AEC will count every vote which is cast, even if concessions happen. Someone would not concede unless they were 100 per cent sure they were going to lose. By Michael Doyle By Michael Doyle WA Premier Mark McGowan has dismissed suggestions his popularity helped Labor poll well in his state. He said new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese led a great campaign that helped capture the WA seats of Swan, Pearce, Hasluck and Tangney. Mr McGowan says the Liberal Party, at both state and federal level, does not appeal to mainstream Australia. ""They have become quite a fringe group. They don't have very talented people in the parliament, both state and federal,"" he said. ""They seem to be off on niche issues and arguing with each other rather than promoting the interests of the state, and the people of the state."" By Michael Doyle The Victorian Liberal Party has acknowledged the results of Saturday's election show change is needed in their party. Liberal seats of Goldstein and Kooyong were lost to independent candidates and two other seats are still too close to call. State Liberal leader Matthew Guy says while losing seats to independents is nothing new, it should prompt political parties to reflect. ""Elections give you a message, they've given both the Liberals and the Labor party a message in Victoria,' he said. ""It's now up to all of us to listen to them, because Victorians are saying they want change in one form or another."" By Michael Doyle Independent Dr Monique Ryan says she has spoken to former Treasurer Josh Frydenberg after he conceded the seat of Kooyong. The new member says she will make a statement shortly. By Emily Sakzewski Today I rang Dr Monique Ryan to congratulate her on the election result in Kooyong and wished her well for the term ahead.It's been an incredible privilege to have served as the local member for the last 12 years.Kooyong is where I grew up, and where, with my wife Amie, we are raising our family.Every day I have given the job my all.Inspired by the wonderful local people I have met, among them those who volunteer in our charities and sporting clubs, and work in our small businesses and schools.We have achieved so much together.It is their contribution that makes our community great. A community whose diversity, tolerance and values reflect the very best of Australia.I want to thank everyone who I have had the pleasure to work with locally.It's been quite a journey.Their support and friendship has been extraordinary and deeply appreciated.To the people of Kooyong, I can only say thank you.I look forward to spending more time with my family.  By Emily Sakzewski Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg has conceded defeat to his independent opponent Dr Monique Ryan. ""Today I contacted Dr Monique Ryan to congratulate her on the election result in Kooyong,"" he tweeted. ""It’s been an incredible privilege to have served as the local member for the last 12 years."" Mr Frydenberg said he looks forward to spending more time with family By Emily Sakzewski Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong are well on their way to Tokyo for a Quad meeting. But what can we expect there? Greg Barton is Chair in Global Islamic Politics at the Alfred Deakin Institute for Citizenship and Globalisation at Deakin University. He says at this week's meetings, Japan and India will be looking for signs Australia is serious about engaging with Asia. Another old friend with deep and long-established links in Asia, France, will be looking for signs of a reset. The US will be reviewing its expectations of what Australia, under a Labor government, is prepared to contribute to both the Quad security dialogue and to the AUKUS trilateral security pact. Read more of Greg's analysis here. By Emily Sakzewski Former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack says the Coalition would have performed better in the federal election if he was the leader of the National party. The Member for Riverina lost a leadership ballot to Barnaby Joyce last year and has repeatedly refused to rule out making another tilt at the leadership. ""There shouldn't have been a change of leadership of the National Party in June last year, there simply shouldn't have,"" Mr McCormack said. ""At the last election, the Nationals were all returned to their seats, and we had a couple of transitioning seats with incumbents retiring and new members coming in, and the votes were much higher last time than they were this time."" The Coalition's numbers were decimated by a rise of independents and the Greens in the lower house, but the Nationals have managed to retain all of their seats, with the possible exception of Cowper which remains too close to call. ""Certainly no inner-city politicians or candidate was ever campaigning against Michael McCormack and using my name and discussing my integrity and reputation,"" Mr McCormack said. He is yet to declare whether he will challenge Mr Joyce for the leadership, but said he had been asked to. ""I have discussions with colleagues all the time, and some of them are wanting me to put my hand up,"" Mr McCormack said. ""I appreciate that some might have said only Barnaby Joyce would have got Hunter over the line. Well, he didn't."" Reporting by Victor Petrovic. By Emily Sakzewski  An electorate held by the Nationals for all but two years since federation has given the party a shake-up by supporting a teal independent who has made the seat too close to call. Cowper, on the NSW Mid North Coast, was the only seat still in doubt for the Nationals almost 48 hours after polls closed in the federal election. A 6.54 per cent swing against incumbent member Pat Conaghan has left him about 6,000 votes in front of independent Caz Heise, according to the Australian Electoral Commission. Ms Heise has attributed the narrow margin to an electorate fed up with the status quo. ""The government are not serving us the way that they want to be served and they're not listening to us the way that we want to be listened to,"" Ms Heise said. Ms Heise campaigned on similar issues to her metropolitan counterparts — a more ambitious climate policy, a national integrity commission and better gender representation. She said those who had voted for her weren't satisfied with the National's climate policy. ""Taking real action on climate change, according to science not according to politics, is what the people of Cowper want,"" Ms Heise said. Mr Conaghan acknowledged that some of his Coalition counterparts had hurt their fortunes on Saturday. ""Comments from people like Matt Canavan saying net-zero is dead in the water did a great deal of damage,"" Mr Conaghan said. ""I've taken that up with my party and I'll certainly take it up with Matt Canavan."" Mr Conaghan said he supported the Coalition's net-zero emissions target by 2050. Reporting by Nick Parmeter and Fiona Poole. By Emily Sakzewski The peak body campaigning for the Uluru Statement to be implemented says the new government should begin charting a course to a referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. Commitments from the government on progressing the Uluru Statement have been welcomed by the From the Heart campaign, with Director Dean Parkin saying the government needs to set a timeline on its plan. ""We urge the new government to set a clear pathway to a referendum,"" he said. Before his press conference this morning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags installed in the media room and affirmed his plan to implement the statement and launch a referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament. First Nations' groups have previously put forward May 2023 or January 2024 as proposed referendum dates. Reporting by Dana Morse. By Emily Sakzewski Tasmanian Liberal MP Bridget Archer said the party should consider quotas to improve the number of women in the party after their loss on the weekend. Ms Archer said she was considering putting her hand up for the party's deputy leadership to stop it moving further to the right. She also said more needs to be done to improve representation of women in the party, flagging the possibility of quotas. ""I think it's something that needs to be considered, it's considered after every election,"" she said. ""I think we need to work to create an environment where it's actually an attractive proposition for women to seek preselection."" By Emily Sakzewski Dai Le, who beat high-profile Labor candidate Kristina Keneally in the Sydney seat of Fowler, says it's an ""honour"" to be elected. The former Fairfield deputy mayor overturned Labor's 14 per cent margin in the electorate to secure a narrow victory over Ms Keneally, a former senator and NSW premier. Ms Le is a former ABC journalist who has previously stood for the Liberals in state elections and believes her back story resonated in the diverse electorate held by Labor since its creation in 1984. She was born in Vietnam, arrived in Australia aged 11 after spending three years in a refugee camp in the Philippines. Read more about Dai Le's win here. By Emily Sakzewski As the Coalition begins to plan for its future, northern NSW Nationals MP Kevin Hogan says he will be looking for a leadership position within the party. Mr Hogan won the flood-affected seat of Page for the fourth time, with ABC projections showing him leading with nearly 63 per cent of the two-party preferred vote and attracting a 3.5 per cent swing to the Nationals. ""I'll be certainly asking for a shadow cabinet position to increase my influence and role there,"" he said. In the neighbouring seat of Richmond on the far north coast of NSW, Labor’s Justine Elliot is likely to retain the seat she has held for 17 years. The AEC is not releasing a preference count in Richmond but currently shows the incumbent Labor MP about 1,700 votes ahead of the Greens candidate, comedian Mandy Nolan, on first preferences. The ABC’s preference estimate for a count between Labor and the Greens projects Labor is well ahead by more than 10,000 votes. Reporting by Bronwyn Herbert.

28,From bad to worse: Where to for the WA Liberals after another disastrous election? ,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes After a 2017 state election bloodbath which toppled Colin Barnett's long-term government, WA Liberals consoled themselves with the message that things could not get any worse. How wrong they were. In the five years since, things have continued to get substantially worse for WA's once-dominant political force. At a state level, the Liberals barely exist. They held on to just two lower house seats in the 2021 election wipe-out, forcing them to hand leadership of the Opposition to the Nationals. Like in 2017, Liberals thought that result 14 months ago was as bad as things could get for them. And they were wrong again. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The scale of the Liberal losses in WA's federal seats may not be quite as extreme as that state result, but blue-ribbon territory has once again fallen all over Perth. And instead of battling irrelevance at just the state level, WA Liberals now face exactly the same fate federally. Once again, the WA electorate has sent a loud and clear message to the Liberals. And once again, voters will be watching closely to see how the party responds. Liberal strategists always knew some WA losses were possible, given the popularity of Mark McGowan, apparent voter resentment towards Scott Morrison and the Coalition's support for Clive Palmer's High Court border challenge. But as the campaign wore on, WA Liberals expressed optimism the damage might not be as bad as they once feared. Going into election night, they knew Swan and Pearce were deeply vulnerable and they had a serious fight on their hands from 'teal' independent Kate Chaney in Curtin. But strategists were expressing hope, bordering on confidence, that Ken Wyatt would hold on in Hasluck and the Curtin challenge would be overcome. In the end, the losses in those two seats were not even the most surprising results. Tangney, which has only been won by Liberals since 1984, fell to Labor by a not-insignificant margin. And even more shockingly, the Liberals are no certainties to hold on in Moore — a seat thought of as so safe that neither party really spent any real time even thinking about it going into polling day. Liberal Ian Goodenough is ahead there, but not by anywhere near enough to feel close to comfortable. In Pearce, Swan and Hasluck, the results were not even close. The Liberals barely even got 40 per cent of the two-party preferred in Pearce and Swan And while things were substantially closer in Curtin, that was not enough to prevent what should be the bluest of domains falling out of Liberal hands. The upshot is that the Liberals were thrashed right across Perth, even in territory they once felt comfortable in. And the losses were across the board too, from ritzy Curtin to outer suburban battlegrounds such as Pearce and Hasluck — the swings against the Liberals in many seats were in the double digits. For the WA federal Liberals who remain, the coming days and weeks will bring heavy soul searching as they try to begin rebuilding a shattered party. But there will also be extremely tough questions facing state Liberals. More than a year since their WA electoral annihilation, can they say things have actually improved, as they look ahead to the next WA election now less than three years away? Questions about how long David Honey should remain as WA leader may well become more pressing for state MPs nervous about what they saw on the weekend. The WA Liberal team hoped McGowan's popularity had taken a hit from the dire situation facing the state's hospitals and how he handled reopening interstate and international borders. But whether that is true or not — and the evidence of Saturday night's result certainly makes it seem dubious, at the very least — is now almost a side issue for conservatives, because WA voters have again made their views about the Liberals painfully clear. In the space of five years, the WA electorate has delivered three incredibly emphatic rejections of Liberals in the state. Now the clock is ticking to turn things around before voters are left to contemplate if they should repeat the trick next time they go to the polls.

29,"NSW Now: Heavy rain set to stick around all week, flood warnings in Lismore",politics,"  Here's what you need to know this morning. More rain is forecast for everywhere from the NSW south coast to the Queensland border today, with a minor flood warning in place for parts of the north coast, including Lismore. The Bureau of Meteorology's James Taylor says parts of the far north-east have received more than 100 millimetres of rain, including Kingscliff. Minor flood warnings are in place for the Wilsons River at Lismore this morning, along with the nearby Richmond River. Sharon Fox from the SES  says the state's north coast and Cronulla in Sydney's south have received especially heavy falls. ""If people wake to find their house has been inundated by heavy rain overnight, please give us a call on 132 500,"" she said. ""If you're experiencing any trees coming down due to the heavy falls, please do give us a call. If it's life-threatening, always dial triple zero."" The New South Wales Liberal Treasurer, Matt Kean, has labelled the weekend election loss an ""unmitigated disaster"", saying the party needs to get its act together to win back the support of those the party has ""abandoned"". His comments came after the Liberal Party lost three Sydney seats to teal independents, with moderate Liberal MPs unseated in Wentworth, North Sydney and Mackellar. Mr Kean, a senior moderate, said the party had paid the price for misreading the electorate and abandoning the centre ground. ""It's an unmitigated disaster. I mean, the Liberal Party needs to get its act together when it comes to dealing with the issue of climate change … [and] listening to women,"" he said. ""And they need to be standing up when it comes to integrity in politics and looking to have a serious policy when it comes to an integrity watchdog in our federal political system."" Nationals MP Michael McCormack is not ruling out another tilt at the party's leadership. The Member for Riverina has held onto his south-western New South Wales seat and says he has already discussed the broader results with Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce. Mr McCormack says a swing against him in his electorate is likely due to broader sentiment towards the federal Coalition. ""Look at the trying times we've had just in the past three years. There's a lot of angst in the community,"" he said. ""There's a lot people who feel aggrieved by the circumstances which have befallen them because of circumstances well and truly outside the government's control."" Police are appealing for information after the discovery of two mobile, clandestine drug laboratories and methylamphetamine in Sydney’s south-west. Last month, officers were called to a property on Long Street, Smithfield, after the discovery of two trailers containing chemicals, solvents and equipment consistent with the manufacture of prohibited drugs. The drug and firearms squad assisted in the dismantling of the labs and subsequent seizure of around 8 kilograms of methylamphetamine powder, and a further 28 kilograms of methylamphetamine liquid. Drug and firearms squad commander Detective Acting Superintendent Gillian Lister said police were confident that someone might have seen the owner or occupants of the vehicle in the vicinity of the property. “Methylamphetamine is a scourge on our community, and I urge anyone with information to do what is right and come forward to police,” Superintendent Lister said.

30,"For the first time in their history, Melbourne seats have turned from blue to red. But it's not all smooth sailing for Labor",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the first time in its 73-year history, Higgins has turned red. The well-heeled electorate has been Liberal since it was created in 1949 and has been home to prime ministers Harold Holt and John Gorton, as well as the country's longest-serving treasurer, Peter Costello. But now it is Labor's. It's just one part of the seismic political shift in Victoria, which, for once, has played a critical role in a federal election. In 2019, Victoria threatened to turn the election for Bill Shorten but it never eventuated. Three years later, the Liberal resistance has been broken. The party's vote across the state collapsed by nearly 6 per cent. And it's worse in its city seats, where it has lost Higgins and Chisholm to Labor, and the former blue-ribbon seats of Kooyong and Goldstein to teal independents. And it could lose more. Deakin remains on a knife's edge, while Menzies was in doubt until late Monday when the ABC predicted the Liberals would retain it. The trend is similar to the 2018 state election when Daniel Andrews annihilated his opponents, and the ALP seized seats across the eastern suburbs. And while some Liberal strategists were banking on anti-lockdown, anti-Andrews sentiment working in their favour, it didn't flow the Liberals' way. So why have voters deserted the Liberal Party? Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Liberals concede the party's brand has been smashed, particularly with Scott Morrison in charge. Liberals have privately reflected that the shift in attitudes towards the party in Victoria began under Tony Abbott's leadership, when a blokey approach turned women off. In short, it's drifted too far from the centre. As the dust settled on Sunday, Liberals conceded the climate wars had been damaging. So too the lack of movement on a federal integrity commission, which angered many voters who decided after nine years of Coalition rule enough was enough. Shifting demographics have also hurt the party — the Coalition has found it difficult to engage with younger voters. The government's perceived Sydney-centric approach was also not lost on voters. In Kooyong, it was easy to observe some voters feeling the Treasurer had sold out his home state, especially during Melbourne's devastating second 2020 lockdown. Two of the states that went hardest against the Morrison government, Victoria and WA, were the ones that copped the most flak from Canberra for their COVID response. Josh Frydenberg rejected the criticism of his pandemic commentary. But on other issues, particularly climate, he acknowledged the party needed to change. ""The people have spoken and it's now up to the Coalition to listen,'' he told ABC Radio Melbourne. While the soul-searching is only just beginning, some in the Liberals are surprised the defeat in Victoria isn't heavier. Some Liberals on Sunday highlighted that the Coalition had been in office for 17 of the last 22 years and in recent years had lacked a clear agenda. The campaign's messaging in the outer suburbs during the last week may have saved a few Liberal hides, but many aspects of its election strategy failed. In Kooyong, Josh Frydenberg's campaign was centred on name recognition, with ""Keep Josh"" a key message. But Liberals say there wasn't enough of a focus on his local agenda. The Liberals were keen to paint Anthony Albanese as a clone, or puppet, of Daniel Andrews. ""We thought there would be a bigger Dan Andrews effect in Vic and there hasn't … We have had such negative feedback about those harsh lockdowns in Vic, and we thought that may play out in those outer-suburban areas. Clearly, they haven't,'' Victorian Liberal senator Jane Hume conceded on election night. There's anger and despair that the Scott Morrison-led strategy of ignoring the party's crown jewels in order to win suburban seats failed so spectacularly. But that doesn't mean it's all smooth sailing for the ALP. It was not the thumping victory often reserved for a change of government. In its safe outer-suburban seats, places once considered Labor's working-class heartland, the party faced swings against it. The pandemic has turbocharged voters already feeling neglected by the government in areas that were hardest hit by the pandemic. Labor insiders concede there is a clear warning for it in the 'burbs and it needs to lift its game, especially before November's state election. The political groups who dub themselves ""freedom"" parties all performed well in Labor strongholds. By Sunday afternoon, the United Australia Party had 4.8 per cent of the statewide vote, One Nation had 3.7 per cent and the Liberal Democrats had secured 2.5 per cent. All major parties must grapple with this new movement. The Greens too did well. They have about 13.5 per cent of the state's votes and are within striking distance of winning a second Victorian seat in Macnamara. Postal votes will decide the outcome, but those should help Labor, with many Jewish voters in the electorate who do not cast their ballot on the Sabbath likely to favour the Liberals and Labor. The Greens were effective in leveraging the national discussion on teal independents who demanded stronger action on climate, a drum the Greens have been beating for years. There's no doubt politics has dramatically changed in Australia and Victoria, and a look at the state's electoral map shows you why. ""Safe Labor"" seats are turning green and ""safe Liberal"" electorates have turned red and teal. That is a big lesson for Premier Daniel Andrews heading into the state election at the end of November. There's also another lesson from the election: More than two years into the pandemic, the era of the incumbent is over. Andrews has more of an agenda to sell than Scott Morrison did, but he also oversaw the country's toughest and longest lockdowns. Labor knows it will need to sell a positive message to voters. As for the state Coalition, the lesson is that it needs an agenda to campaign on. It will need to differentiate itself from the federal Liberal brand, which could be a tough challenge if Peter Dutton becomes opposition leader. The Australian people have spoken, so how did it all unfold? Swings against the Liberals in the federal seat of Menzies, if repeated in November, could oust Matthew Guy from his Bulleen electorate, although that is a simplistic analysis. That risk could be reduced if the Coalition is able to focus voters' minds on a campaign based on state issues. While many conservative commentators are urging the Coalition to become even more conservative, this would be an unwise decision in Victoria, Liberals say. Many believe it must position itself as a sensible centrist party if it's to have a chance to be a genuine alternative to Andrews. Having an agenda will allow it to also highlight government failures without being a one-trick pony. To do that, the party needs to work out what it stands for and attract some fresh blood to the party. And that could be a big ask.

31,"The election is done and dusted. Here's who's in, who's out and who's just hanging on in the NT",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes After six weeks of campaigning, the political dust is starting to settle across the Northern Territory. And while some election candidates are already booking flights to Canberra, others are packing up their corflutes and contemplating their next political move. So, who's in, who's out and who's just hanging on? Here's a wrap of what went down on election night and what we can expect in its aftermath. It's close. Very close. But according to ABC chief election analyst Antony Green, Labor is projected to retain the seat. The retirement of veteran MP Warren Snowdon gave the Country Liberal Party (CLP) hope of seizing the electorate for the first time. But despite a swing towards its candidate Damien Ryan, the former Alice Springs mayor was still more than 1,000 votes behind Labor's Marion Scrymgour as of Sunday night. While there are still postal, absentee and interstate ballots to be counted, Mr Green believes the CLP won't get enough of the remaining votes to reel in Labor's lead. It means Ms Scrymgour is expected to add Member for Lingiari to her illustrious political CV, which includes the previous title of Deputy Chief Minister of the NT. In other results in Lingiari, the Greens' Blair McFarland is third on first preferences with about 10 per cent of the vote, while One Nation's Tim Gallard is fourth with just over 5 per cent. The mood at the major parties' election functions said it all. The CLP's event was a sombre affair; Labor's was a jubilant celebration. That's because incumbent MP Luke Gosling won a historic third term in office, with almost 60 per cent of the projected vote. After winning three years ago with a 3.1 per cent margin, the former commando this year defeated his CLP rival Tina MacFarlane with a projected margin of more than 9 per cent. After spending two terms on the opposition backbench, Mr Gosling is now hoping to get a ministerial portfolio in the incoming Albanese government. Of the other contenders in Solomon, the Greens' Aiya Goodrich Carttling came third with 14.5 per cent of the first preference vote, followed by the Liberal Democrats' Kylie Bonanni with 10.3 per cent. Even before the election, the Senate race was a foregone conclusion. Historically, the two Senate spots have been split by Labor and the CLP. So, it's no surprise the Territory's two major parties once again secured the majority of the first preference votes. It means Labor's Malarndirri McCarthy is all but assured of retaining her Senate seat. She's expected to be joined in Canberra by the CLP's Jactina Nampijinpa Price. Ms McCarthy is a Yanyuwa woman from the Gulf region, while Ms Price is a Warlpiri-Celtic woman from Alice Springs. It'll be the first time two Indigenous Territorians have represented the NT in the Senate. Most votes for Lingiari, Solomon and the Senate have already been counted. However, the distribution of ""declaration"" votes — which include postal, absentee, and interstate ballots — begins on Tuesday and could continue throughout the next fortnight. It's difficult to predict how influential they'll be as it's not known how many will be returned. But in a closely fought seat like Lingiari, the Australian Electoral Commission's Geoff Bloom said counting could continue for weeks before a winner is declared. ""We need to get these declaration votes through the counts and see what difference that makes to the numbers and the gap,"" Mr Bloom said. ""That is going to take the best part of two weeks for all of the declaration counts to be concluded.""

32,"There's a surprise contender for the sixth Senate seat in Queensland, and they've got high hopes",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Much has been made of the throng of Greens elected in lower house Queensland seats after the weekend's federal election, but could another voting trend play into the state's new ""Greensland"" nickname? With 34 per cent of the vote counted, Legalise Cannabis Australia has so far garnered 74,972 Senate votes, a swing of nearly 5 per cent from their 2019 results. Their candidate Bernard Bradley is within striking distance of the sixth Senate seat, ahead of high-profile minor party candidates Clive Palmer and Campbell Newman. As the count stands, Pauline Hanson will keep her seat in the upper house, but the UAP's chances are floundering and Mr Newman's Liberal Democrats are behind Legalise Cannabis. Whether they catch Senator Hanson and One Nation or not, the party has likely ensured they will receive AEC funding for exceeding 4 per cent of the Senate count in Queensland. Party president Michael Balderstone has been involved with the party since its origins in the northern New South Wales town of Nimbin in the early 1990s. Back then, the party was known as Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) Party. Mr Balderstone said the decision to change the name prior to the 2022 race helped the party cut through, but getting people to publicly campaign remains a hurdle. ""Not many people want to wave their arm around and say, 'Yeah! Yeah! I smoke weed!' whereas, you know, old hippies like me from Nimbin, it's expected of us,"" he said. ""Generally, most of our candidates were genuine medical cannabis users and people on the ground who are campaigning have got a strong passion."" Pain relief and the cost of medicinal cannabis are a pillar of the Legalise Cannabis 2022 campaign. ""They mocked us for a long time, you know, for saying cannabis is a medicine – we were ridiculed,"" Mr Balderstone said. ""Now it's accepted and anyone in Australia can get legal medical cannabis through their doctor, but it's pretty much grown in Canada or grown indoors. ""We could all be growing our own medicine."" Raylene Herd is one of the 75,000 who voted for the single-issue party in Queensland. Ms Herd has terminal cancer and uses medicinal cannabis to ease the pain, but it is not cheap. She receives around $1,860 a month in disability pension, but between $1,000 and $1,300 of that goes to her cannabis prescription. ""It doesn't leave you a lot of money to live with,"" she said. ""I lost everything. I couldn't pay my mortgage, I lost my house, I was homeless for a while and now I'm living with my 89-year-old father."" She said the cost of her pain medication pushes her budget to the extremes. ""After I get my medication, I'd be lucky to have $200, $300 a fortnight and that is for everything — that is to try and keep the car registered and petrol, that is trying to put a roof over my head, get food, everything,"" she said. ""I will barely eat, that's basically what it comes down to. I buy fresh food when I can, mainly fruit. ""Sometimes I buy ice cream and stuff to make smoothies to try and bulk myself up, but I'm losing weight horrendously. Because of cancer and because I just can't afford to nourish myself."" She said without the medicinal cannabis she is ""curled up in a ball in pain"", and the pharmaceutical options are simply not viable, wearing off too quickly and inducing a ""spiralling circle of pain and pharmaceuticals and vomiting"". ""Unless you have experienced the difference, you wouldn't understand it,"" she said. Queensland is where Legalise Cannabis Australia has had its strongest showing outside of the Northern Territory, where its 2,664 votes translate to 7 per cent of the vote. Mr Balderstone said the national campaign was run on a shoestring budget after the party spent more than $30,000 entering candidates in every state and territory, but lead Queensland Senate candidate Mr Bradley contributed money to the campaign in the Sunshine State. ""Queensland did have more money and energy for the campaign, maybe that made a difference,"" Mr Balderstone said. He also noted there have been nearly 130,000 applications for medicinal cannabis in Queensland, more than double any other state. ""Medical cannabis, I think, got more of an open green light in Queensland early on in the licensing of it. That's possibly helped too — to a lot of people from Queensland on medical cannabis,"" Mr Balderstone said. ""[There's] a lot of retirees in Queensland, and cannabis is fantastic for chronic pain or crook backs or if you can't sleep. ""A lot of people have discovered it legally. That'd be part of it, too."" Or perhaps, he said, it was just the general laid-back nature of the state's constituents. ""I think Queensland is just more relaxed, probably,"" he said. Adjunct professor of politics at Griffith University Anne Tiernan said she thinks the higher vote for Legalise Cannabis is more likely a reflection of a disgruntled electorate. What do you want to know about the upcoming election? How will it impact you? Do you have a story you want to share? Tell us more. Even so, she was surprised by their success, especially compared to the UAP. ""Isn't it extraordinary that the [United Australia Party] got so little a return on its investment of just vast amounts of spending and advertising and the Legalise Cannabis party has done so well,"" she said. ""It really begs the question about whether they then want to build a platform and a network – those small parties have often really struggled to do that, so it's probably a better result than they were expecting, but [it's] just indicative of how the major party vote splintered and fragmented across the state and across the nation."" Dr Tiernan said it was ""a bit of a stretch"" to assume this result was the beginning of a political wave for the party, but said it was important for any party to reach that magical 4 per cent. ""It means that they've got a financial platform to build on in a way that they didn't before,"" she said. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory.

""Our job really is to re-educate people on the truth, and that's getting out there,"" he said. ""The statistics are coming out of America ... people don't get criminal records they've got to carry all their life.

33,How Western Sydney voted and why the results were difficult to predict,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Voters in Western Sydney have delivered both major parties a ""mixed bag"" of results following Saturday's federal election. The Labor Party managed to increase its vote in most of its marginal seats, but lost Fowler in south-west Sydney — for the first time since its creation in 1984 — to a high-profile local independent. Meanwhile, the Liberal vote across the state was decimated at the hands of teal independents, but the party managed to retain some seats in Western Sydney. ABC chief election analyst Antony Green said there was no unifying trend across the seats. ""So it's a bit of a mixed bag of results … there's no general pattern of swings across Western Sydney,"" he said. A stand-out for Labor was the key seat of Greenway. Covering 81 square kilometres in Blacktown City Council, Michelle Rowland retained the seat with an increased swing of more than 6 per cent. In the marginal Liberal seat of Lindsay, on the western edge of Sydney, sitting member Melissa McIntosh was re-elected with a small swing against Labor. And the seats of Macarthur and Werriwa, in outer south-west Sydney, have again gone to Labor with almost no swing. The United Australia Party polled strongly in a number of seats, including the safe Labor seat of McMahon, winning 9.4 per cent of the vote there and, in Werriwa, 9 per cent. Mr Green said the outcome had more to do with how hard the parties had campaigned in the electorate. ""The results we've seen in Western Sydney seem to be more related to the amount of effort a party put in. ""So the Labor Party campaigned strongly in several electorates and got swings to it. Whereas, seats where they didn't do a huge amount of campaigning, like Lindsey, they didn't get much reward at all."" In the seat of Fowler, where Labor parachuted former NSW Labor premier, federal frontbencher and outgoing senator Kristina Keneally, the strongest campaigning came from the independent, Dai Le. Yesterday, Ms Keneally conceded, while behind by a little more than 3,000 votes. Businesswoman and deputy mayor for Fairfield City Council, Ms Le said her victory was a response to the Labor Party overlooking local Vietnamese Australian lawyer Tu Le to contest the seat in favour of experienced outsider Ms Keneally. The party's decision, at the time, caused controversy, with claims Labor was paying lip-service to issues of diversity. ""The Fowler community is saying, 'Look, we are going to have our own voice. We're going to stand up. We're going to speak up for ourselves',"" the Vietnamese-Australian candidate told the ABC yesterday. NSW Labor leader Chris Minns said the party would be looking closely at the result but there was a ""whole bunch of messages"" to take away from the poll. He acknowledged that candidates had to reflect the views of their constituents, but stopped short of admitting it had been a mistake to pre-select Ms Keneally into a seat she was not from. ""Well, look, obviously she gave it her all. She's gone out with dignity,"" he said. ""But the lesson for all members of parliament is you have to re-elect and work hard for your local community. ""And that's, obviously, a lesson that every political party will take from an election like we've just seen."" According to Mr Green, bringing in an external candidate ""encouraged the independent to run"" in Fowler. He said it was a strategy that Labor would have to re-think in future. In the seat of Parramatta, however, Labor's hand-picked candidate from the eastern suburbs, Andrew Charlton, retained the seat for the party. On Sunday night, Mr Charlton had registered 54.6 per cent of the vote compared to 45.4 per cent for Scott Morrison captain's pick, Maria Kovacic. The NSW Liberal Party's result was an unmitigated disaster, according to NSW Treasurer and senior moderate Matt Kean. He acknowledged that the Liberals did not get their choice of candidates ""right"". ""We need to make sure we're putting forward our best and brightest, that reflects the communities they're looking to serve,"" he said. ""I'm confident … [we can] come up with the winning formula that we need to get the right candidates for the right seats."" He also said the Coalition had a lot to reflect on in Western Sydney. ""I'm reflecting on the fact that we need to be focused on those communities,"" he said. ""We need to be focused on the concerns that they have around building infrastructure, providing schools hospitals, growing the economy, creating jobs and raising living standards — and ensuring that families in Western Sydney are able to give their kids the best education that they're able to access quality health care when they need it.""

34,"Eric Abetz, conservative warrior, 'unlikely' to win",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Eric Abetz's 28-year stint in the Senate looks all but certain to come to an end, with him requiring a mammoth below-the-line vote in order to continue his political career. The Jacqui Lambie Network's Tammy Tyrrell is considered likely to be elected to the sixth Senate seat, having received 56 per cent of a quota, with just over half the votes counted. Election analyst Kevin Bonham said a result with two Liberals, two ALP senators, Green Peter Whish-Wilson and Ms Tyrrell being elected was ""very clear cut"". ""On current figures, it's very hard to see anything that could unsettle that,"" he said. It means Senator Abetz requires a sizeable below-the-line vote to leapfrog colleague Wendy Askew for the second Liberal Party senate spot — a prospect Dr Bonham said was highly unlikely. ""His below-the-line vote would have to be absolutely enormous for him to retain, so I would assume that he is going to lose and that Wendy Askew will be the second Liberal,"" he said. ""Eric Abetz would need to have a below-the-line [vote] of something in the order of 10 per cent, which is almost twice what (former Labor senator) Lisa Singh got in order to become effectively the second Liberal in the count after preferences. ""That seems to be extremely unlikely, without having seen any figures."" Senator Abetz told ABC Radio Hobart on Monday morning that he was not making a concession ""at this time"". ""But it'd be fair to say it'll be pretty tough,"" he said. ""There's light, there's hope and so we will wait and see, but with that said, I'll be attending to tidying up my office. ""In the event I'm re-elected, I'll have a tidier office which won't be a bad thing, and if not, I'll have a head start on the task that awaits me."" He said the Liberal Party did well in Tasmania at the election but he was ""disappointed"" to have been placed third on the party's Senate ticket. ""The feedback I've got from the overwhelming majority of the party membership is a shake of the head and saying: 'What on Earth were they thinking?'"" he said. ""But that was the process within the Liberal Party, that's what they did, and we will now live with the consequence of that."" Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Prominent Tasmanian LGBTIQA+ rights campaigner Rodney Croome was not waiting for more votes to flow in, already celebrating Senator Abetz's political demise. ""Senator Abetz was a strident opponent of every step towards LGBTIQA+ equality and we welcome the election of Tammy Tyrrell, a supporter of the LGBTIQA+ community, to take his place,"" Mr Croome said. Liberal senator Jonathon Duniam, who took Senator Abetz's regular spot at the top of the party's ticket, said he was not willing to accept his colleague had lost his seat just yet. ""There's a lot of counting to go,"" he said. ""We could be a couple of weeks away from having a clear understanding of what the result will be. ""I remain hopeful that Eric will be returned to Canberra and can continue to do the work he does so well."" ""We know that with the preference flows going in all sorts of directions anything can happen. ""It is a tight race, and I don't think we can stand here confidently and say that one or another outcome will be where we get to,"" Senator Duniam said. Eric Abetz has been a mainstay of Tasmania's political scene since the early 1990s. Born in Germany in 1958 and emigrating with his parents to Tasmania three years later, Senator Abetz went to Taroona High School and studied at the University of Tasmania. It was there that he started to make waves in politics, serving as president of the university's Liberal club and becoming national president of the Australian Liberal Students' Federation. He pursued a legal career, eventually forming legal firm Abetz Curtis with friend Roger Curtis, and became the president of the Liberal Party's Tasmanian branch in 1990. He was elected to the Senate in 1994, chosen to fill a casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Liberal Brian Archer, after missing out on a Senate spot in the 1993 election. A conservative powerbroker inside the Liberal Party, Senator Abetz was appointed special minister of state by former prime minister John Howard in 2001 and joined the cabinet in 2006 as forestry minister. He was a member of Brendan Nelson, Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott's shadow cabinets between 2007 and 2013, holding the portfolio of innovation, industry, science and research before moving into employment and workplace relations. He held that portfolio as minister, as well as being the leader of the government in the Senate when Mr Abbott won the 2013 federal election, until he was dumped in 2015 when Mr Turnbull successfully challenged for the leadership. He has since been a vocal member on the backbench, espousing his Christian views on a range of policy matters. He has opposed same-sex marriage, action on climate change, and abortion rights, has regularly attacked the union movement and is a staunch advocate for the monarchy and Australia generating nuclear power. Senator Abetz was demoted to the third spot on the Liberal ticket last year, and has since said he has fallen victim to ""ageism and sexism"". Jacqui Lambie's office manager went to school in Ulverstone and Devonport on the state's north-west coast. The future of Labor's parliamentary agenda may rest in the hands of the Greens and independent Jacqui Lambie, who look set to hold the balance of power in the Senate. Her LinkedIn page shows she has had a varied work history, working as a service station attendant and on a farm in South Australia before working as a packer, potato harvester and farmhand on the north-west coast. She has also worked as an administrative assistant and in the employment services sector. When she was announced as the Jacqui Lambie Network's top Senate candidate, Ms Tyrrell likened herself to Senator Lambie. ""What you see is what you get. I'm honest, I'm frank, I'm genuine. I live in the real world, and we need more people from the real world in parliament,"" she said. ""I know I'm not a usual candidate for the Senate. ""I didn't go to uni, I don't have a law degree, I'm not rich or from a well-off family, and I've never been a member of a union. Most politicians seem like they've come straight from an assembly line. I've worked on one.""

35,Labor's election result may once have triggered an existential crisis in the party. So where does that leave Albanese?,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes In any other decade, this would be a result that triggers talk of an existential crisis in the Labor Party. Instead, Anthony Albanese becomes the 31st Prime Minister on a primary vote lower than Bill Shorten's repeat electoral failure in 2019. Remarkably, the ALP is the first party to win government from Opposition with declining primary support. Albanese appears likely to secure a majority in his own right. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog And while this will allow Albanese to claim a modest mandate on climate action, an integrity commission and childcare, his Liberal opponents are left a shattered mob with whole pews of its moderate wing obliterated from its fabled broad church. Welcome to the new world of Australian politics, one that has a whole third dedicated to a panoply of crossbench priorities. It is likely that the 2022 election will go down as the moment the long-strained two-party system of government snapped. The election result heralds a permanent structural change to Parliament. The old parties cannot be assured of control anymore, even if it's been coming for a while. The Australian people have spoken, so how did it all unfold? The Greens have gnawed at the ALP's left flank for decades. They will at least triple their number in the 47th Parliament, taking down a moderate Liberal along the way. Now the teal independents have wreaked havoc on a generation of other moderate Liberals in an instant — snuffing out the Treasurer and presumptive Liberal-leader-in-waiting Josh Frydenberg. His defeat is a terrible blow to his party. Frydenberg (Kooyong), Trent Zimmerman (North Sydney), Dave Sharma (Wentworth) and Tim Wilson (Goldstein) have preached moderation but were punished for consistently voting alongside Barnaby Joyce and Matt ""net zero is dead"" Canavan. The company they kept has been catastrophic. No wonder senior Liberal Simon Birmingham indicated a preference for the Liberals to live apart from the Nationals for a period. Birmingham clearly wants the blue team to find its own bearings, on climate especially. Scott Morrison's burden is voters' emphatic rejection. After winning the ""miracle"" 2019 election, Morrison shaped the Liberal Party in his own likeness. Voters didn't like what they saw. Labor got exactly what it had been angling for all along: a referendum on Morrison. Morrison's stubbornness on integrity only fuelled Labor's concerted traducing of his character. But the PM was damaged goods even before the six-week campaign started. His brand was shop-soiled and worn in the withering glare of contrasting COVID-19 grievances. In Victoria — the Coalition's weakest state — antipathy for the Morrison government only strengthened when the PM and Frydenberg criticised Premier Dan Andrews's lockdown response in 2020 and 2021. Traumatised Victorians, already sensitive to their sacrifices, instinctively sided with their Premier. In Saturday's election, they registered their delayed protest. So, too, in Western Australia, where Morrison was severely penalised for siding with Clive Palmer in a High Court constitutional challenge on Labor Premier Mark McGowan's hard border. Nothing bristles West Australians more than presumed attacks on its secessionist spirit. They reacted brutally, with a 10.9 per cent swing to Labor, triple the national average. The Liberals have surrendered hallowed Liberal turf to the ALP in Perth. And if, as it appears, the conservatives lose Curtin to independent Kate Chaney, it has lost the Liberal crown jewels. Morrison's support for controversial captain's pick candidate Katherine Deves became a poison chalice elsewhere. The Deves factor doesn't explain the losses to the teal independents, but became a symptom of Morrison's problems countering the inner-city progressive mood. He sought to campaign on his economic record and failed to present an ambitious policy agenda. Some Liberals say this was neglect, particularly given Labor's attempted framing of the contest as a judgement on him. They wanted Morrison, instead, to audition for the next term. However, without a compelling agenda, and his public standing damaged, Morrison instead set about encouraging voter hesitation about Albanese. Albanese helped Morrison in that regard. The Labor leader had the poorer campaign, struggling with details, occasionally looking unassured. Some say he was underprepared, perhaps even complacent. Others in Labor say Albanese's always been more of a ""big picture"" guy. The son of a single mother, born into a life in public housing, Anthony Albanese has achieved his life-long wish of becoming Prime Minister. In any case, like Morrison, Albanese eschewed a grand policy agenda for fear of repeating Shorten's mistake in 2019. So it became a contest between the undeserving and the unimpressive, the unpopular against the unconvincing. Morrison lost on both counts. In a tussle between two men intent on energising enmity against the other, Albanese was judged the least-worst candidate. But one-third of voters' primary support went to ""others"". An indictment of the two major parties? Possibly. More likely a sign of a fractured electorate that has been steadily sinking the floor from underneath the Coalition and the ALP. In this environment, federal politics will change. The crash-or-crash-through mentality will not be rewarded in the long term when two-thirds of the nation does not necessarily see it your way. So parliament is at a crossroads, even if Albanese musters a majority government in coming days. That's because the Senate will need careful negotiation. A decent and authentic man, Albanese must now attempt to strike an agreement on policies where ambition varies: think climate action and integrity. The Greens, teals and other independents bring their own ideas on these fronts. Albanese says he'll be a consensus leader. And there's no doubt he masterfully handled minority government for Labor from 2010 to 2013. He must now show the many Australians who did not give him or the ALP their first vote that, collectively, the nation has chosen the right man at the right time.

36,The final warning for Morrison fell on deaf ears. Now women have voted him out,politics,"  Scott Morrison can't say he wasn't warned that women were angry. But will the next Liberal leader heed the lessons Morrison ignored? The history of human congress is littered with the stories of men who wake up to Dear John letters after years of not listening properly when the women in their lives say they're unhappy. But Scott Morrison – who received God knows how many final warnings from Australian women over the past year but chose every time to continue bulldozing happily along — seems to have achieved something novel, having unmistakably on Saturday night received a John Deere letter. Morrison's bulldozing ways are central to this upheaval in the political landscape and to the damage done to the Liberal Party. Much of central Melbourne has been purged of Liberal men, replaced significantly by members of the fastest-growing single demographic in Australia, which for some reason unknown to modern political science also was the group most consistently ignored and talked-down to by Scott Morrison: professional women. The rout in Melbourne claimed Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and high-profile  junior minister Tim Wilson. It sent Peter Costello's old seat of Higgins to Labor for the first time ever, and seriously threatened Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar. ""At least Alan Tudge survived. That's the important thing, I suppose,"" quipped one ashen-faced Liberal on Saturday night. Tudge (the question of whose membership or otherwise of the cabinet has now been firmly settled by the Australian people) suffered a primary vote swing against him in Aston of about 11 per cent, but will make it out of this parched Death Valley of disapproval on his hands and knees, surviving on a malodorous cocktail of One Nation, Clive Palmer and Liberal Democrats preferences. In NSW, Sydney Harbour now wears a teal collar: North Sydney, Warringah, Mackellar and (though it's close) possibly Wentworth too. Central Brisbane's gone Green. And in Western Australia, a staggering 11 per cent slump in the Coalition's primary vote was paid out lavishly to Labor — which collected Swan, Pearce and Hasluck. It ousted Scott Morrison's confidant Ben Morton, in ""safe"" Tangney, thanks to Labor candidate Sam Lim, a dolphin trainer who speaks 10 languages. And Julie Bishop's old seat of Curtin — another treasure once much squabbled-over by Liberal aspirants — now joins the teal ranks, in the hands of lawyer, consultant and mum-of-three Kate Chaney. ""Women did not see their concerns and interests reflected in a party led by Scott Morrison in coalition with Barnaby Joyce,"" said Julie Bishop on the Nine network on Saturday night. Well, the question has to be asked: Why? Scott Morrison, feted within his party as a tactical campaign genius, missed chance after chance to notice what was going on with Australian women. And it's not like it was that hard to spot. When COVID-19 hit, who was simultaneously the most likely to lose paid work and the most likely to take on more unpaid work? Women. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Who was more likely to work in the low-paid sectors of whom Australia asked so much in the pandemic — aged care workers, cleaners, teachers? Women. Child care was the first sector pulled off JobKeeper. Who works in child care centres? Women. Who did the lion's share of supervising children in lockdown, caring for elderly relatives, and coping with the explosion of anxiety and despair among adolescents? Metrics abound to confirm that it was women, again. But when Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg presented their first COVID Budget, where was it aimed? At construction and manufacturing, significantly; male dominated sectors that were less badly hit by COVID-19, but more generously helped. Then came the shock wave of Brittany Higgins's disclosure of her alleged experiences in Parliament House. Women's disgust at the culture of Australia's Parliament spilled over into the streets in protests around Australia. Morrison — after having to be nudged by his wife Jenny — expressed sympathy for Higgins, but later piously reminded the marchers how lucky they were to be living in a country where protesters were not shot. None of these instances of prime ministerial cloth-earedness is a hanging offence, of course. But people learn about their prime ministers by watching how they respond under pressure. And observers of Scott Morrison this term could not possibly have missed that here was a man happy to force out a female CEO for handing out $20,000 worth of watches to high-achieving executives, while enforcing no consequences at all for the chain of blokes (including himself) who managed to blow $1.8 billion AND ruin lives on the grotesquely mishandled Robodebt. Last March, amid the storm of revelations about parliamentary culture, Morrison staged a press conference at which he said he had been ""doing a lot of listening over this past month"". ""I have heard about being marginalised, women being intimidated, women being belittled, women being diminished, and women being objectified. That is not OK. ""Women who are afraid to walk to their car from the train, and they carry their keys in their hand like a knife for fear of being attacked. That is not OK. That is not acceptable. ""These events have triggered, right across this building and indeed right across the country, women who have put up with this rubbish and this crap for their entire lives, as their mothers did, as their grandmothers did."" Morrison said he was sympathetic to the idea of a quota for the preselection of women in the Liberal Party. And then: Nothing. Preselections in his own state of NSW, as you may recall, devolved into an ugly, venal, factional dirt-fight among (largely) Liberal Party men determined not to let each other get the upper hand. The result? Many seats where the Liberal Party didn't even select a candidate until the election (whose timing was, keep in mind, also set by the Prime Minister) in an epic act of rudeness and arrogance to voters in those seats. In Warringah, the hand-picked candidate was Katherine Deves, a woman whose crusade on trans women in sport was applauded by Scott Morrison, though he distanced himself from some of her more deranged remarks. To the extent that Morrison explicitly mentioned women during the campaign, it was often to support the defence of women's sport, as argued by Deves and by the Tasmanian Liberal Senator Claire Chandler, whose private members bill to exclude trans women from women's sport Morrison warmly supported. And fine: It's perfectly reasonable to discuss these matters. But for a prime minister who promised $150m last election for the ""Female Facilities And Water Safety Stream"" to build much-needed change rooms for women in venues where only the blokes have showers and toilets, and then blew 80 per cent of that money on swimming pools for 11 Liberal and National electorates, the sudden conviction that the real problem for sporting women is the potential of a trans teammate is — well, a lot. As the Prime Minister fanned out over Australia campaigning in his famously image-rich style, it became clear that he was doubling down on his decision to chase the bloke vote. An analysis by the Financial Review at the one-month mark established that Morrison heavily favoured manufacturing locations for photo opportunities. Fifteen of those, compared to seven community events. Anthony Albanese, on the other hand, favoured photo-ops with health and care workers. This may seem trivial — and the Labor leader had his fair share of high-vis too — but there is no accident in the planning of campaign visuals. We see what they want us to see, and Morrison wanted us to see him in high-vis. And of course women work in high-vis too, but not to the same extent that men do. To the external eye, it looked like a deliberate strategic gamble; that the PM believed he could afford to burn professional women (and possibly some leafy Liberal seats) because he'd capture blue-collar men in outer suburban areas. Liberal vote-druids briefed that ""the trans stuff"" was absolutely hoovering up votes in religious and socially conservative communities in Labor-held seats. Except that when the votes rolled in on Saturday night, there was very little evidence of anything of the kind. Is a nasty campaign tactic rendered even nastier by the fact that it didn't work? I don't know, but this little frolic — sponsored enthusiastically by Australia's 30th Prime Minister — was an exercise in profound awfulness. (Worth reflecting, too, on just who will be doing the emotional work now of reassuring the young people affected by this campaign stunt, telling them they're okay and that they are welcome to play sport. Who will be doing that stuff? You know the answer.) The truly astounding part of this story is that there were good things Scott Morrison could have said to women. He had more women in his Cabinet than ever before. They've committed billions to aged care and to child care, eventually, and made some valuable inroads to mental health and domestic violence services. He has some excellent female ministers, with whom he did not campaign enough. But when Morrison spoke every day at his press conferences — usually they come with an introductory piece of oratory about whatever is top of mind that day for the PM – he did not make any perceptible effort to address areas of interest to women. The air on Saturday night was thick and feathery with chickens coming home to roost. Seats with large numbers of Chinese-born voters, like Chisholm and Bennelong, swung hard against the government. Polling in the Chinese language Sydney Today suggested that Chinese-born Australians were not big fans of Defence Minister Peter Dutton's advice to Australians to ""prepare for war"". ACT Liberal Senator Zed Seselja — though counting continues — looks as though he might lose his seat, an unprecedented result surely related to the PM's airy promise last week to further fillet the public service. It cannot be a coincidence that the population of Western Australia — who Morrison last year dismissed as cave people because they secured the borders to their state — gave him an historic clubbing, with a swing of 11 per cent. When Leigh Sales asked Scott Morrison in the final week about the threat to the government in the ""teal"" seats, he replied in effect that voters in those seats were rich enough not to have to worry about real issues. ""Many of these places, I suppose, are less vulnerable to the impacts of the economy than, say, many of the places I've been in this campaign."" As we know, there's nothing women love more than a bloke telling them they don't know what they're talking about. The response on election night to these sentiments was unmistakeable. And Scott Morrison, just over a year after he declared himself open to a quota system, has presided over a campaign that cut the number of Liberal female MPs in the house of representatives from 13 to 6. It's difficult not to feel sorry for the departing Liberal women and for the Liberal moderates who lost their seats on Saturday night. They were punished for a set of circumstances not of their making. But I suspect every time Tim Wilson or Josh Frydenberg or Jason Falinski screamed about how much money their opponents were spending, or complained about how unfair it all was on them, or moaned that teal posters were being stuck up everywhere, it made things worse not better. And every time the teal independents were attacked as vacuous, or hypocritical, or hapless pawns of a powerful man, that made things worse too, because they likely reminded the professional woman listening of a time when things like that have been said about her. Those MPs were vulnerable because their party neglected for years to fix its relationship with women. And neglected for years to come to a sensible compromise on addressing climate change, rather than fighting like ferrets in a bag. And the overriding message of this campaign isn't really about Liberal or Labor. It's that local communities are tired of political bullshit. They don't want big parties to take their votes for granted — whether it's parachuting a high-profile external candidate in at the last minute, or refusing to do anything about aircraft noise (a powerful local issue that seems to have cost both the majors in the Queensland seats of Brisbane, Griffith, Ryan and Dickson). There's a massive lesson there to be learned. Are the right people listening?

37,The first challenge facing Albanese is to restore Australia's economy,politics,"  For all the Coalition's boasts about superior economic management, Anthony Albanese's primary task will be to navigate his new government through the minefield bequeathed to him by his predecessors. Mounting deficits, a mountain of debt, an overstimulated economy and ill-disciplined spending are all operating in a macro-economic environment that no longer reacts or behaves the way the textbooks say it should. That will be no easy task. After almost a decade in government without ever once producing a budget surplus — despite promises to the contrary — the Coalition managed to double the nation's debt even before the pandemic hit. Its legacy? At least another decade of deficits and a trillion-dollar national debt. Ideology often trumped economics as the Coalition repeatedly shut off sources of revenue and added billions of dollars of unnecessary expenditure. It canned the mining tax after politicising it as an evil. In the process, it denied generations of Australians their rightful inheritance and — instead of investing in health, education and aged care — transferred the proceeds to foreign investors. Then there was the carbon tax. It dumped the Gillard government's revenue-neutral carbon price and replaced it with a massive and inefficient subsidy, handing out billions of dollars to polluters in a scheme that now has been transformed into… a carbon price. And while it could rightly claim credit for shielding much of the country from the ravages of the worst recession in a century, it did so via a $90 billion scheme, Jobkeeper, that hosed extraordinary amounts of cash onto a large number of recipients who simply didn't need it. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog That cash — along with an additional $240 billion COVID spending — has helped ignite an inflationary tinderbox. And, as a parting gift, the stage-three tax cuts — now endorsed by the incoming Albanese government — will strip $37 billion a year from revenue by early next decade, line the pockets of middle and high-income earners and turbo-charge inflation. More on that later. It is difficult enough to try to fix the mistakes of others. In some cases, such as the mining tax, it just isn't worth the political mileage to revisit old battlegrounds. But what do you do when all the old rules no longer apply? Two cornerstones of economic theory appear to have come adrift in recent times that will make life ever tougher for the new government. Both revolve around inflation: one the relationship between wages and inflation and the other, economic growth and inflation. For 30 years, consumer prices for everyday goods have been in check. Suddenly, they're surging out of control and most of the current crop of politicians and monetary chiefs are in unfamiliar territory. For years, the Reserve Bank was being castigated for not generating enough inflation. Suddenly, now, there's way too much. Wages, however, have remained stubbornly subdued, squeezing spending power in what essentially is a real pay-cut. Boosting workers' wages by 5 per cent – for all workers, not just those on the minimum wage — would lead to an increase in prices across the economy of about 2 per cent, according to a new report. It became one of the defining issues of the election: pressures around the cost of living. The burning question was whether the minimum wage should be raised to the same extent as the cost of consumer items. As the election entered its final week, two days of data drops from the Bureau of Statistics were supposed to resolve the battle. Everyone expected to see a lift-off in wages. The RBA had even taken the unusual step of raising interest rates during the election campaign in anticipation. Except, it didn't happen. When the data emerged, we saw the lowest unemployment in 48 years at just 3.9 per cent. With inflation powering ahead at 5.1 per cent, wages should have shown at least some early signs of momentum. Instead, the gulf between consumer prices and earnings widened as wages grew by just 2.4 per cent. It was a devastating blow for Scott Morrison, but now becomes an enormous challenge for Anthony Albanese. It was also an unnerving week for economists. According to what's known as the Phillips Curve, wages are supposed to rise when unemployment drops. Part of the accepted economic wisdom, it was a theory formulated by a Kiwi, A. William Phillips — who worked as a crocodile hunter in Australia before a groundbreaking stint at the London School of Economics in the 1950s. His theory makes perfect sense. When there's a shortage of workers due to low unemployment, business owners are forced to offer more money to attract employees. In tough times, when a lot of people are out of work, wages stagnate. But for much of the past decade, wages have been decoupling from employment. Somewhere around 2011, just after the Global Financial Crisis, the relationship began to break down in Australia. As the economy recovered, the Reserve Bank predicted wages growth would return. The graph below charts the RBA predictions each year against what actually happened. Instead of growing in 2011, wages growth slumped. So, the next year, the RBA figured it merely had been delayed and made a similar prediction for 2012. It didn't happen again. Increasingly desperate and exasperated, the RBA boffins repeated the projections each and every year for the next six years. Full marks for perseverance. There's no clear answer to why wages are stuck in neutral. The RBA postulated that employers were offering other incentives, such as one-off bonuses, extra days off and other benefits. Anything except permanent pay rises. Perhaps the reason it can do this is that the jobs market is not an entirely free market. It is governed by tight laws, particularly around industrial action. Our industrial relations system has been designed specifically to keep wages under control. Australian workers saw their base wages rise 2.4 per cent over the past year, but high inflation meant they took a large real pay cut. From industrial chaos in the 1970s, strike action and industrial disputes have fallen to negligible levels. Private sector wages have been restrained by Enterprise Bargaining Agreements while state governments have kept pay rises in check. Unwinding those arrangements would be nigh on impossible, meaning sustained wage rises in Australia are highly unlikely any time soon. After a year of making himself and the opposition a small target, however, the incoming prime minister took the unusual step of attaching a number to the upcoming tribunal deliberations on the minimum wage. Less than a fortnight out from the election, Mr Albanese nailed his colours to the mast, saying he ""absolutely"" supported a 5.1 per cent pay rise for the 2 per cent of workers on the minimum wage. Mr Morrison was quick to respond, backed up by many in the business community. Such an increase, he said, was ""like throwing fuel on the fire of rising interest rates and rising costs of living"". There's no doubt wage rises fuel inflation. But, if limited to those earning the bare minimum, they would be negligible. Wage rises deliver more spending power, adding to inflation. But so too, do tax cuts. And when it comes to inflationary pressure, the mammoth restructuring of our income tax system in 2024 will deliver it in spades. The Parliamentary Budget Office delivered its verdict a fortnight ago on the stage-three cuts, pushing up the overall cost by a further $22 billion. All up, the tax cuts will inject $206 billion into middle and upper-income earners' pockets in just its first eight years of operation. If consumer prices are still rising at this pace, that's going to force interest rates much higher. Fuel on the inflationary fire? Or scorched earth?

38,"Sworn in as PM, Albanese makes first change inside parliament before heading to Tokyo",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Anthony Albanese has been sworn in as Australia's 31st prime minister, as his incoming Labor government takes power after almost a decade of Coalition rule. Mr Albanese gave his first press conference as Prime Minister soon after being sworn in, flanked by several of his new ministers and a symbolic first change behind him. The incoming government has added the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags alongside the Australian flag. The weekend's election result has the Liberal Party on the hunt for a new leader, with Peter Dutton emerging as the most likely replacement for Scott Morrison. Mr Albanese was sworn in with his deputy, Richard Marles, and frontbenchers Penny Wong, Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher. Mr Marles was sworn in as Employment Minister, Senator Wong as Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Chalmers as Treasurer and Senator Gallagher as Finance Minister, Minister for Women and Attorney-General. The Prime Minister and Senator Wong have flown to Japan on Monday to meet with the leaders of the Quad — the United States, India and Japan. ""Travelling to the Quad meeting in week one signifies how important we believe this partnership is for our security,"" Senator Wong said in a statement. “And we will be taking new energy and much more to the table — including our commitment to act on climate change after a lost decade."" US President Joe Biden phoned Mr Albanese late on Sunday, congratulating him on the win and thanking him for choosing to travel to Tokyo for the meeting. There has been uncertainty about what role Mr Marles will hold. As deputy leader, he can pick his portfolio and there is speculation he wants to return to defence. Clarity on this will come next week when the full frontbench is sworn in. Mr Albanese wants national cabinet to meet in person in the coming weeks as he sets about implementing his agenda. He said the new parliament would sit for the first time before the end of July, but that he was still seeking advice from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet about when would be the most reasonable time for it to return. Liberal sources have told the ABC that Mr Dutton, who served as a senior cabinet minister throughout the Coalition's three terms, has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Mr Morrison. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was among the biggest victims of the Coalition's loss, losing both his seat and the likely leadership of the Liberals in opposition. The ABC has been told by sources that, without Mr Frydenberg, Mr Dutton appeared to have the numbers to become leader. Sources have also told the ABC that South Australian senator Anne Ruston is being touted as a possible deputy to Mr Dutton, with Liberals conceding they need to do more to get women into their ranks. About half the Liberal women in the lower house lost their seats in this election, fuelling the need for a woman to play a senior role in the leadership. Cabinet ministers Karen Andrews and Sussan Ley's names have also been touted, but their support in the party room remains unclear. Bridget Archer, who retained her seat — despite it being the Coalition's most marginal — told the ABC on Monday morning that she was considering nominating to be deputy leader, vowing to be a vocal, moderate voice. The Liberal Party's greatest losses came thanks to teal independents — women who wiped out moderate Liberals from once-safe seats in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. Liberal sources expect Mr Frydenberg will mount a political comeback but his path back to the parliament remains unclear. ""I still have fire in my belly,"" he said on Sunday morning, while refusing to concede until postal votes were counted. Labor has lost two women from its cabinet ranks, with Kristina Keneally's attempt to be parachuted into a safe Western Sydney seat failing, and Terri Butler losing her Brisbane seat to the Greens. The Greens will enter the next parliament with record numbers in their ranks. The party will hit a high-water mark of 12 in the Senate, where it now holds the balance of power. Thanks to gains in Queensland, the party has also added to its lower house seats. Labor had a big night in Perth, wiping out Coalition cabinet ministers and once-safe, prized Liberal seats. Attorney-General Michaelia Cash, the deputy Liberal leader in the Senate, blamed Mr Morrison for the party's fortunes in the west. She said his decision to initially back Clive Palmer's legal action against WA's closed border proved costly, with Mr Morrison's close confidant Ben Morton losing his Perth seat. ""We — Senator Cash and Mr Morton — did not support siding with Clive Palmer but the decision was made that we would,"" she said. As of Monday morning, Labor was yet to reach the 76 seats needed to form government. If it falls short, it will need the support of the crossbench to pass legislation in the House of Representatives. To be sworn in as Prime Minister, Governor-General David Hurley needed to be convinced that Mr Albanese would be able to govern in some form. The election results have shown that Labor was the only major party that would be able to govern — either in majority or minority. If the results had been closer and it was clear there would be a hung parliament, but no clarity around which party would secure the support of the crossbench to form government, then the Governor-General would not have agreed to swear in Mr Albanese or Scott Morrison. The Governor-General has to have confidence that whoever becomes prime minister will be able to maintain a stable government, whether that's with the support of the crossbench or not. He also would have received legal advice before the swearing-in to make sure it was the right decision. Usually there would not be the kind of rush there is this time around, but the Quad leaders meeting in Tokyo has meant the process has had to be expedited. Mr Albanese said he had already received assurances from several independents that they would support his government if Labor was unable to secure a majority in its own right. ""I have received and have had discussions with the existing members of the crossbench and received confirmation from Rebekha Sharkie, Bob Katter, Andrew Wilkie, Helen Haines and Zali Steggall that they would not support any no-confidence motions against the government, and that they would also secure supply,"" Mr Albanese said. Incoming teal independents Monique Ryan, who defeated Mr Frydenberg, Zoe Daniel, who defeated Tim Wilson, and Allegra Spender, who defeated Dave Sharma, have said they want the incoming government to take greater steps to address climate change. In the Senate, if it is unable to reach an agreement with the Coalition, it will need the Greens and, likely, Jacqui Lambie to pass legislation.

39,Five charts reveal a complex reality underscoring Labor's win,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes When you pick through the entrails of this most unusual election, a fundamental shift in Australian politics is laid bare. The way Australians regard the two-party system has changed — for both sides of the aisle. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Different dynamics are at play in different parts of the country, with the Coalition tending to lose seats to Labor in suburban areas, and losing to independents in wealthier areas of capital cities. It leaves Labor with a clear lead in seats in the house of representatives, even if the incoming Prime Minister doesn't quite end up commanding a majority. Like 2019, the two-party preferred swing varies from state to state. Swings toward the Coalition in Tasmania have helped it hold the marginal seats of Bass and Braddon. But Western Australia has delivered for Labor, with the party picking up a swing in the double digits. That has swept Labor members into office in Swan, Pearce, Hasluck and Tangney, with the seat of Moore still in doubt. The state swing chart paints a picture of a Labor whitewash, but the end result is far more nuanced than that. Anthony Albanese becomes Australia's 31st Prime Minister with his party winning a historically low primary vote. Altogether, the share of the primary vote going to candidates outside the major parties looks to be over 30 per cent. That's a record high, and a significant increase even compared to the trendline of recent decades. The crossbench has more than doubled in size, with teal independents some of the big winners. Liberal members in those seats have suffered large drops in their primary votes. In North Sydney, Trent Zimmerman's vote fell 14.5 percentage points, and in Goldstein, Tim Wilson lost 13.1 percentage points from his primary. The Greens look to have obtained their highest lower house first preference vote ever, marginally improving on their 2010 result. But more importantly, that vote has been concentrated in all the right places for the party to maximise its haul of seats. On top of retaining the seat of Melbourne, they've won Ryan in Brisbane and are in very good shape to win Griffith as well. The seats of Brisbane and Macnamara could be won by either the Greens or Labor. So if all goes well for the Greens, Adam Bandt could be leading a group of five MPs in the lower house — which would be the largest minor party stake in the lower house since 1949. While One Nation's national primary vote has gone up, that's largely an artifact of the fact that the party ran in more seats this election compared to 2019. In the seats Pauline Hanson's party ran in last time, the party has seen its primary vote go backwards. That includes some big swings in the seats they performed best in three years ago. In Hunter, the seat that One Nation had its biggest first preference vote, its first preference vote is below 10 per cent — nearly 12 per cent less than 2019. So while the non-major party vote has surged, the balance of votes in that bloc has shifted toward the left and centre of the political spectrum. In a campaign that included a bitter battle over the net-zero target, it's not hard to see who in parliament has won the day.

40,Long-time Liberal and Labor voters explain why they went Green or independent at the federal election,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The federal election result has shown a tectonic shift in voting, with a handful of Greens swept into the lower house and Senate, as well as some high-profile Liberal MPs losing to ""teal"" independents. Parliament is shaping to look very different with so many members on the crossbenches. So, what's driven voters towards the Greens and progressive independents? At 27, Tom Jordan has always put Labor first, but not this year. ""I've voted for the Greens first, Labor second,"" the Queenslander said. Queensland's losing LNP and Labor candidates in three inner-city Brisbane seats decline requests to speak to media, following a historic ""greenslide"" swing towards the Greens. ""As a unionist and a socialist, I've always voted sort of Labor on principle. So this is the first time that I didn't feel like I could do that with a good conscience, really."" He said the major issues for him were housing and healthcare, which he thinks both the ALP and Coalition have neglected. The Griffith voter said he also used his ballot as a protest against inaction by the major parties, helping to give Greens candidate Max Chandler-Mather the edge over ALP incumbent Terri Butler, who has conceded defeat. ""I think it's the only way to really push the major parties further to the left or further to doing something about climate change,"" Mr Jordan said. The recent floods and bushfires weighed heavily on Mr Jordan's mind. He thinks they might have contributed to the shift towards the Greens in Ryan, Griffith and Brisbane. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog ""I think it's interesting that Brisbane has been the biggest swing to the left and swing to the Greens, because we've just gone through some pretty catastrophic weather events,"" he said. Several well-funded independents ran against established Liberals on a promise of climate action and government integrity. Here's how the night has turned out for them. ""I think it's really fresh in everyone's mind; people are starting to realise that it does have something to do with climate change. ""I think people have seen how the federal government have dealt with a lot of that stuff, and realise that they haven't done a very good job."" In Sydney's affluent eastern suburbs, it's the teal independents seizing on the shift. Ian Tresise had voted for the Liberal Party for 58 years, but said he found it difficult to relate to the current Coalition. Mr Tresise cast his vote for independent Allegra Spender, in the eastern Sydney seat of Wentworth, where she has unseated high-profile Liberal MP and former diplomat Dave Sharma. Mr Tresise said he could not understand the attitude toward climate policy held by some in the ranks of the outgoing government, describing Nationals senator Matt Canavan's recent comments on the nation's net-zero target as ""outrageous"". It's because of this, he believes, the country is missing out on economic opportunities presented by a transition to renewable energy. Mr Tresise said he found Ms Spender to be an ""outstanding"" candidate who had energised the electorate. ""I have a daughter who works in energy policy,"" he said. ""She tells me that she's embarrassed to identify as Australian, because they say, 'how can you talk to us about energy policy when you're so bad?' ""That's pretty compelling."" In Mackellar, on Sydney's northern beaches, Sophie Scamps became the first independent to win in the seat's 73-year history. She unseated moderate Liberal Jason Falinksi in the process, riding the wave of an 11 per cent swing against the incumbent. John Forbes said because Mackellar had been such a safe Liberal seat in the past, he usually felt his vote did not matter. But when presented with the opportunity of an independent with policies he supported, he switched from blue to teal. Mr Forbes credited the decision in part to the influence of his daughter, Bronte, who barracked for Ms Scamps in the family home. ""I think collectively the policies that they [independents] had ticked a lot of boxes for a lot of people and that's what made it so successful,"" he said. ""Bronte was really about the climate change side of things but from my side it was more about the integrity.""

41,What's changed the day after the election? Here's some quick info to catch you up,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Good evening Australia. It's the day after the election and the results are still rolling in from across the country. If you've been off enjoying a Sunday sesh or the sunshine, here are the answers to five quick questions to catch you up. So far, the ABC has called 72 seats for Labor. But it is still not known if it will claim the 76 seats needed to form a majority government. The Coalition has won 52 seats. The Greens have won three seats, with a fourth one still in play. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Several seats remain in doubt, and it could be several days before there is a result. So far, 14 new women have been elected to the lower house. Three seats previously held by women were won by men. Seven seats remain too close to call including Bass, Brisbane, Cowper, Gilmore, Lyons, Macnamara, Menzies and Sturt. The outcome of those seats will determine if more women are elected to the lower house. Out of the 76 seats in the Senate, 40 are being decided this election. The ABC is projecting Labor will win 25 seats, short of the 39 needed for a majority. No government has held a majority in the Senate since John Howard's prime ministership. The Coalition could hold 30 seats, meaning the Greens and Jacqui Lambie might hold the balance of power. The Greens could have up to 12 senators — their largest-ever presence in the upper house. Lambie might have three Senate spots after her party gained a second Tasmanian seat. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson might lose her Queensland Senate seat. Her candidate in South Australia could win the final seat in that state. Clive Palmer's United Australia Party (UAP) is on track to win zero seats in the Senate. This is despite spending tens of millions of dollars on election advertising. So far, Legalise Cannabis Australia has received more Senate votes in Queensland, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania than the UAP.

42,Albanese's rise from humble beginnings to the prime ministership,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is a politician moulded by his humble start to life as the only child of a single mother who raised him on a pension in gritty inner-Sydney suburbia. He is also a hero of multicultural Australia, describing himself as the only candidate with a ""non-Anglo-Celtic name"" to run for prime minister in the 121 years the office has existed. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog His friends pronounce his name ""Alban-ez,"" like bolognese. But having been repeatedly corrected over the years by Italians, the nationality of his absent father, he introduces himself and is widely known as ""Alban-easy"". Mr Albanese's financially precarious upbringing in a housing commission home in suburban Camperdown fundamentally formed the politician who has led the Australian Labor Party into government for the first time since 2007. Addressing his supporters at Canterbury-Hurlstone Park RSL Club in his hometown of Sydney, Mr Albanese pledged to bring Australians together. He is still widely known by his childhood nickname, Albo, and lists his three great faiths in life as The Catholic Church, the Labor Party and the South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league team. ""It says a lot about our great country that a son of a single mum who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing down the road in Camperdown can stand before you tonight as Australia's prime minister,"" Mr Albanese said in his election victory speech. ""Every parent wants more for the next generation than they had. My mother dreamt of a better life for me. And I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars,"" he added. During the six-week election campaign, Mr Albanese repeatedly referred to the life lessons he learned from his disadvantaged childhood. As a young child, to spare Mr Albanese the scandal of being ""illegitimate"" in a working-class Catholic family in socially conservative 1960s Australia, he was told that his Italian father, Carlo Albanese, had died in a car accident shortly after marrying his Irish-Australian mother, Maryanne Ellery, in Europe. His mother, who became an invalid pensioner because of chronic rheumatoid arthritis, told him the truth when he was 14 years old: His father was not dead and his parents had never married. The incredible search that revealed the father Anthony Albanese thought was dead. Carlo Albanese had been a steward on a cruise ship when the couple met in 1962 during the only overseas trip of her life. She returned to Sydney from her seven-month journey through Asia to Britain and continental Europe almost four months pregnant, according to the Labor leader's 2016 biography, Albanese: Telling it Straight. She was living with her parents in their local government-owned house in inner-suburban Camperdown when her only child was born on March 2, 1963. Out of loyalty to his mother and a fear of hurting her feelings, Mr Albanese waited until after her death in 2002 before searching for his father. Father and son were happily united in 2009 in the father's hometown of Barletta in southern Italy. The son was in Italy for business meetings as Australia's minister for transport and infrastructure. Anthony Albanese was a minister throughout Labor's most recent six years in power and reached his highest office — deputy prime minister — in the government's final three months, which ended with the 2013 election. His ascent to the role came on the back of his support for Kevin Rudd in a leadership spill, which saw the former prime minister return as leader, ousting then-prime minister Julia Gillard in the process. An emotional Mr Albanese had backed Mr Rudd in an unsuccessful leadership spill the year previous, choking back tears when he announced his intent to support Ms Gillard's removal. He said he had made the move as an attempt to end the infighting which had plagued the party since Mr Rudd's 2010 ousting. The son of a single mother, born into a life in public housing, Anthony Albanese has achieved his life-long wish of becoming Prime Minister. In reference to ending the internal turmoil, Mr Albanese, who was then the leader of the house, said he wanted to get back to ""fighting Tories … that's what I do"". Mr Albanese's critics argue that it is not his humble background but his left-wing politics that make him unsuitable to be prime minister. The Coalition argued throughout the campaign he would be Australia's most left-wing leader since Gough Whitlam. It was Mr Whitlam's introduction of free university education that enabled Mr Albanese to graduate from Sydney University with an economics degree despite his meagre financial resources. Mr Albanese's supporters say that while he was from Labor's so-called Socialist Left faction, he was a pragmatist with a proven ability to deal with more conservative elements of the party. Mr Albanese has undergone what has been described as a makeover in the past year, opting for more fashionable suits and glasses. He also shed 18 kilograms in what many assumed was an effort to make himself more attractive to voters. Mr Albanese says he believed he was about to die when he was involved in a two-car collision in January last year and that was the catalyst for his healthier life choices. After the accident, Mr Albanese spent a night in a hospital and suffered what he described as external and internal injuries that he has not detailed. He briefly resigned himself to a fate he once believed had been his father's. The 17-year-old boy behind the wheel of the Range Rover SUV that collided with Mr Albanese's much smaller Toyota Camry sedan was charged with negligent driving. Mr Albanese said he was 12 when he was involved in his first political campaign. His fellow public housing tenants successfully defeated a local council proposal to sell their homes — a move that would have increased their rent — in a campaign that involved refusing to pay the council in a so-called rent strike. The unpaid rent debt was forgiven, which Mr Albanese described as a ""lesson for those people who weren't part of the rent strike: Solidarity works"". ""As I grew up, I understood the impact that government had, can have, on making a difference to people's lives,"" Mr Albanese said. ""And in particular, to opportunity."" On election day, before the vote counting started, he spoke of an advantage from his upbringing. ""When you come from where I've come from, one of the advantages that you have is that you don't get ahead of yourself. Everything in life's a bonus,"" Mr Albanese said. Mr Albanese's partner, Jodie Haydon, and his son, Nathan, from his first wife Carmel Tebbutt, shared the stage with the Labor leader during his victory speech. Ms Tebbutt, a former deputy premier of New South Wales, married Mr Albanese in 2000. The couple separated in 2019, but Ms Tebbutt was in the crowd last night and was acknowledged by Mr Albanese during his speech.

43,"New Greens senator elected in SA, as One Nation, Nick Xenophon and Rex Patrick disappointed at results",politics,"  South Australia will have two Greens senators for the first time since 2016, while Nick Xenophon and Rex Patrick have almost certainly failed to get elected. One Nation has received the highest vote of any party after Labor, the Liberals and the Greens, but its lead candidate is not hopeful of becoming South Australia's sixth representative in the upper house. With 592,000 South Australian Senate votes counted as of 4pm ACST, the Liberal Party has won two quotas, the Labor the same and the Greens just under one. One Nation received 4.1 per cent of the vote, ahead of the United Australia Party on 3.3 per cent. The unaligned candidates, which included former senators Nick Xenophon, Stirling Griff and Bob Day, also received 3.3 per cent of the vote, while Senator Patrick received 2.1 per cent. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Incoming Greens senator Barbara Pocock said the next generation of voters was backing her party's policies. ""We have had so many young people come up to us and just take a Greens how-to-vote, no-one else's,"" she said. ""And it's not just about the climate change future, it's about how will I afford a house, how will I get an education?"" Senator Patrick told the ABC his chances of being re-elected were ""low but not impossible"". Mr Xenophon — a former colleague of Senator Patrick in the Nick Xenophon Team — said he was waiting to see how the below-the-line votes fell in the Senate. ""I am not politically dead but rather on life support in an induced coma,"" he said. Senator Griff has also lost his seat, after running under Mr Xenophon in Group O on the Senate ballot. One Nation lead Senate candidate Jennifer Game was hopeful of winning a spot on the red leather after her daughter, Sarah Game, became South Australia's first state MP last month. The older Ms Game said the large number of small parties with similar policies appeared to have split the right-wing vote. ""While I think it's mathematically possible, I don't think it's likely,"" she said of her chances of winning. ""I'm just really thrilled to have got this far, to be honest, so it'd be a very big surprise to me to be elected. ""It all depends how the preferences will flow."" Simon Birmingham and Andrew McLachlan were re-elected as Liberal senators, while Penny Wong and Don Farrell will spend another six years in the Senate for Labor.

44,The winners and losers of the federal election,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Australia has a new government and potentially a new approach to federal politics as Greens and independents became the story of the 2022 election. So, who are the winners and losers from this year's federal election? After 26 years in parliament and just six in government, Anthony Albanese has led Labor from the political wilderness and back into office. The son of a single mother who grew up in public housing, he said he hopes his win will inspire a generation of future leaders. He's vowed to implement policies to address climate change, stagnant wages, closing the gender pay gap, Indigenous recognition and strengthening Medicare. It was a trifecta for the Liberal leader last night — he lost the prime ministership, stepped down as leader of the Liberal Party, and there was a swing of 6 per cent against him in his very safe seat of Cook. Teal independents — named after the colour most used for their election materials — have been one of the major stories of the election. Not only did they challenge incumbents, they beat them across the country. The Liberal Party suffered the biggest losses to independents, but Labor also lost a seat to independent Dai Le, who did not associate with the teal campaign. The Greens have had their best election result, taking their representation in the lower and upper houses to record levels. The party has won the Liberal Brisbane seats of Ryan and Griffith and looks likely to take the seat of Brisbane. Early Senate results suggest the party will reach 12 seats and play a crucial role if Labor is to pass any legislation. While not prepared to concede in Kooyong, it appears clear that not only are his aspirations to be PM over but he's lost his seat to independent challenger Monique Ryan as well. Mr Frydenberg is considered a huge loss for the Liberal Party as it attempts to rebuild after this rout. From the very first results on Saturday night, it was clear we were seeing an election the likes of which Australia had never seen before. With a huge national swing away from the Liberal Party, a smaller swing away from Labor and a surge in votes for minor parties and independents, the chamber will look nothing like the typical blue and red we've seen before. With Josh Frydenberg losing his seat, Peter Dutton emerges from the Coalition's defeat as the frontrunner to replace Scott Morrison as Liberal leader. The outgoing Defence Minister lost to Mr Morrison in a leadership ballot after the Liberal Party dumped Malcolm Turnbull as PM in 2018. The long-serving cabinet minister is one of the most high-profile Liberals still in the parliament. The moderate wing of the Liberal Party suffered the most from teal independent challengers, with the likes of North Sydney's Trent Zimmermann and Josh Frydenberg losing their seats. Leader of the moderate faction Simon Birmingham has been openly conciliatory, saying a lack of ambition on climate action and even historical decisions like taking equal marriage to a plebiscite had cost them in those once blue-ribbon seats. Without Frydenberg, it's unclear which moderate Liberal might now put their hat in the ring to run to be leader of the party. Labor's decision to parachute frontbencher Kristina Keneally into Fowler, one of the most diverse electorates in the country, prompted the Deputy Mayor of Fairfield to run as an independent. Ms Le did not take money from the Climate 200 group, distancing herself from the teal independents, and was able to capitalise on dissatisfaction at Labor's attempt to overlook local candidates for former senator Ms Keneally. The Western Sydney seat of Fowler was one of Labor's safest seats prior to the election, but the retirement of Chris Hayes opened up the field. Keneally's parachuting into a Labor stronghold seat held with a 14 per cent margin to solve an internal party battle has clearly backfired, and her political career may now be over because of it. The former NSW premier moved from Scotland Island in Sydney's northern beaches to Liverpool and spent much of the campaign fending off accusations that she did not understand the very multicultural community and would move on if she did not win. Fowler is one of the few seats Labor lost, so it's a strong personal rejection of the US-born former NSW leader. The popularity of the Western Australian Premier clearly boosted Labor support in the West, where it received its biggest swings. Despite some criticisms from his party for appearing alongside Mr Morrison early in the federal election campaign, Mr McGowan's pandemic popularity appears to have washed over into the federal contest. Labor's picked up at least four seats from the Liberals in WA, thanks to a statewide swing of more than 10 per cent. If federal Labor does manage to secure a majority, it will be a direct result of the WA swing and Mr Albanese will have Mr McGowan's popularity to thank. The first Indigenous person in Cabinet and first elected to House of Representatives was well-liked and, despite not facing an independent challenger, has lost his seat anyway. Wyatt was beaten by Labor's Tania Lawrence, who enjoyed an almost 12 per cent swing away from the MP who had held the WA seat since 2010. Despite all the advertising money spent across the country, Clive Palmer's United Australia Party looks to have not won a single seat in either house of the parliament. Jacqui Lambie appears to have successfully doubled her party's numbers in the Senate, with Tasmanian Tammy Tyrrell on track to join her boss in Canberra. As a party of two, the Jacqui Lambie Network will likely wield influence, given Labor would need support from the Greens and others to pass legislation that the Coalition opposes. It's likely Labor would first look to negotiate with Senator Lambie to get the final numbers to pass its agenda in the upper house. Bridget Archer was the Liberals' most marginal seat holder coming into the election. She bucked the nationwide trend of Liberal losses and looks set to hold onto her Tasmanian seat of Bass. In doing so, she will break the one-term curse that has hung over the seat for the last decade. Archer was one of the most vocal Liberal critics on a national integrity commission — crossing the floor to vote in favour of an independent member's private bill — and protections for queer youths, which she argued should be included in the government's controversial religious discrimination bill. The Labor MP for the inner-Brisbane seat of Griffith would have been environment minister in the incoming government. Instead, her seat looks to have fallen to the Greens, with Max Chandler-Mather gaining a 10 per cent swing. Western Australia delivered some of the biggest results for Labor on election night. One of the biggest victims was Liberal frontbencher Ben Morton, one of Scott Morrison's closest political allies, who suffered a major swing against him. Labor looks set to also win Cabinet minister Ken Wyatt's seat, former Cabinet minister Christian Porter's seat, Julie Bishop's former seat of Curtin, and the marginal Perth seat of Swan.

45,Debate over Indigenous Voice to Parliament may define Albanese's government,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes First Nations people are accustomed to being left at the back of the queue during election campaigns, which typically shrug off the shameful inequalities experienced by so many Indigenous voters. So it was a notable shift to hear incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese open his victory speech with what he spelled out as a key ambition — creating an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. It means we might be getting somewhere after decades of protracted debate over whether the nation should amend the constitution to give First Nations people more say over our lives. The new leader has said he wants a referendum in this term of government to change the constitution to create a permanent Indigenous advisory body to the federal parliament. Indigenous leaders are calling on the next Australian government to hold a referendum on a First Nations Voice to Parliament within two years. If the new government can get support for a bill in both houses of parliament, Australia will go to its first referendum in more than 20 years. Australians were last asked to consider changing the constitution in 1999 during a referendum on the question of whether we should cut ties with the monarchy to become a republic. Aboriginal leaders are pushing for a Voice referendum to be held in May 2023 or January 2024. Building consensus on a path towards a referendum is likely to be one of the major challenges for the Albanese government, but it will be helped by a wave of new independent MPs who support the move. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog This week marks five years since Indigenous people from across the nation gathered at Uluru to come to a consensus position on the best way to change the constitution to bridge the divides between black and white Australia. We don't know exactly what a Voice to Parliament would look like, how it would operate, or how many Indigenous people would be elected or appointed. It's a body designed to sit outside the parliament, to give frank input on policies designed to address this country's sustained failure to close the gap. Labor's Linda Burney has said there will need to be a comprehensive public education campaign to explain the Voice to millions of Australians before a referendum is held. Vote Compass asked whether Australia should amend its constitution to establish a representative body to advise Parliament on laws and policies affecting Indigenous peoples — and there was clear support for the idea. The Wiradjuri frontbencher will be the nation's first Aboriginal woman to take on the Indigenous Affairs portfolio — an incredible achievement — and she's acutely aware of the scale of the challenge before her. For starters, there are differing views within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities about the proposal — the gathering at Uluru was an historic consensus, but it was not unanimous. And there are questions about whether an advisory body with no veto power is ambitious enough. The Greens — a growing political force — have said they would prefer to see action on a Treaty and a truth-telling process before a referendum. But those who back the Uluru Statement — a movement which has predominantly been led by Indigenous women — argue there can be no genuine change in any area of policy without the input of a Voice. How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' Anthony Albanese has said he will reach out to the new leader of the Coalition in attempt to find common ground and shift conservative opposition to a referendum on the Voice. During the campaign, outgoing Prime Minister Scott Morrison bluntly replied, ""Why would I?"" when he was asked if he'd reassess his position on a Voice. But, if the Coalition — in the midst of a gruelling soul-searching period — does move further to the right, the push is unlikely to gain support from many conservative senators and MPs, and then there is a risk there will not be a bi-partisan position. Will that matter? History suggests a referendum will fail without bi-partisan agreement, but some constitutional lawyers say we have no contemporary evidence of that. With high community support for a Voice referendum, perhaps the nation could buck that trend. Thanks to the largest survey of voter attitudes in the country, we can assume Mr Morrison — and Malcolm Turnbull before him — fundamentally misunderstood the growing support for a Voice to Parliament in the community. Close to two-thirds of Australians back the proposal for a referendum, according to the ABC's Vote Compass, and even though a third of rusted-on Liberal and National voters oppose the idea, another 43 per cent support it. The Voice is yet another issue that did not get enough oxygen in a pared-back campaign but it may be the defining debate of Australia's 47th parliament.

46,'A microcosm of progressivism': Queensland Greens celebrate historic 'greenslide' in Brisbane as rivals go to ground,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Queensland's losing LNP and Labor candidates in three inner-city Brisbane seats have gone to ground, following a historic swing towards the Greens in the federal election. The Greens have won the traditionally blue-ribbon Liberal seat of Ryan, and Griffith, the seat of former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd, which has been won by Max Chandler-Mathers. They are also in a strong position in the seat of Brisbane, where Stephen Bates is in a neck-and-neck race with Labor's Madonna Jarret. A spokesperson for LNP's Trevor Evans, who is coming to terms with an 11 per cent swing against him, said today was ""not the right time to speak out"". Defeated member Julian Simmonds has also declined media requests after losing his seat of Ryan, which has been held by the LNP for the most part of 70 years. Labor's former member for Griffith, Terri Butler, has also refused requests to speak to media after conceding defeat online. ""I wish the new member well in delivering on all of the promises he has made,"" she said in a social media post. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Speaking in Queensland on Sunday afternoon, Greens leader Adam Bandt thanked the Queenslanders who were first-time Greens voters. ""A record number of people voted Greens for the first time in this election. I want to say thank you to everyone who voted for the Greens for the first time, especially here in Queensland,"" he said. ""This was a greenslide. More people turn to the Greens than ever before."" Likely to win a seat in the Senate, Greens' Queensland candidate Penny Allman-Payne said while she was ""incredibly proud and excited"" by the result, she was not surprised. ""I am so excited that Queenslanders have chosen to send a regional teacher from Gladstone to the Senate,"" she said. ""We've been campaigning for over 12 months right around the state and everywhere we've gone people have told us they can't find a house to rent... they can't get the dental treatment that they need. ""It doesn't matter where they live. People are experiencing the same thing. ""I live in a coal and gas community. People in central Queensland want a just transition to a renewable energy economy and we are the only party with a plan to do that."" Greens candidate Elizabeth Watson-Brown, who has gained the seat of Ryan, said it was the beginning of ""real change in Australia"". ""It is a really, really interesting representation that the tectonic plates are shifting in politics in Australia,"" she said. ""Many people came up to me at pre-poll and said to me, 'Elizabeth, I am going to vote for you this time. I had been a long-term Liberal voter and I feel completely abandoned'."" Candidate for Brisbane, Stephen Bates, said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" he will win the seat, describing the city as always being a ""microcosm of progressivism"". Re-elected Queensland Labor senator Murray Watt said the party's state election results were a ""mixed bag"". Mr Watt said while there were some ""bright spots"" in Labor's electoral results in Queensland, ""we would probably have liked to have done better"". What do you want to know about the upcoming election? How will it impact you? Do you have a story you want to share? Tell us more. He said Labor still has a ""real chance"" of claiming the seat of Brisbane, with the Greens ahead by just over 300 votes and counting. ""Across inner-city Brisbane, there has been a lot of demographic change in recent years with lots more young people moving in, and very strong environmental consciousness in those sorts of seats as well, that the Greens have been able to capitalise on,"" he said. Mr Watt said a federal Labor government will be able to deliver on climate action, an integrity commission and better treatment for women. ""We would certainly be hopeful of pulling back some of those votes in the future, once we've had the opportunity to do some of the things people want to see."" He said he believed Anthony Albanese will be able to bridge the political divide and unite all Australians. ""He's got a track record as a minister of bringing different groups together to reach consensus and to reach common goals,"" he said. ""It's not just something that he says, he's actually done this before, and I think he'll continue to do that now as Prime Minister.""

47,Greens and Lambie set to determine Labor agenda with Senate balance of power,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Greens and Lambie set to determine Labor agenda with Senate balance of power The Greens and Tasmanian Jacqui Lambie could determine the future of Labor's parliamentary agenda, with the minor parties looking set to hold the balance of power in the Senate. The Greens are on track to have their largest-ever presence in the upper house with 12 senators — two from each of the states. If Labor does not have the Coalition's support, the Greens' support will be mandatory for any legislation it wants to pass. But the Greens alone will not be enough. Senator Lambie looks to have gained a second Tasmanian seat, which will double her party's representation. The ABC is projecting Labor will win 25 seats, short of the 39 needed for a majority in the Senate — something a government has not held since John Howard's prime ministership. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The Coalition will hold the most seats, likely 30, in the majority-female chamber. If Labor holds 25 seats and gets the support of the Greens, Senator Lambie's two votes will be needed to pass legislation. The future of Pauline Hanson, one of the nation's best-known politicians in the country, remains unclear. Her party has one seat not up for election this term, with Senator Hanson in a fight to win the final Queensland Senate seat. Her candidate in South Australia could win the final seat in that state. If both Senator Hanson and Jennifer Game win, One Nation will have three seats on the crossbench. Former senator Nick Xenophon's political comeback has failed, polling behind One Nation and the United Australia Party. Liberal Zed Seselja, based on ABC projections at 2:30pm on Sunday, is ahead of independent David Pocock. However, the former rugby star remains within striking distance thanks to preferences from Labor, the Greens and another independent. The sixth seat in Victoria hangs in the balance, with Clive Palmer's United Australia Party ahead. That state looks to have re-elected two Labor senators, two from the Coalition and one from the Greens. Greens leader Adam Bandt, who sits in the lower house, has dubbed the election a ""Greenslide"" and warned his party will use its balance of power to push for greater climate commitments. ""This result is a mandate for action on climate and inequality,"" he said on Sunday morning. ""We put an alternative to people and people liked what they saw. A record number of people voted Greens for the first time at this election."" Liberal frontbencher Anne Ruston was the manager of government business in the Senate and played a crucial role in crossbench negotiations during the last term of parliament. Speaking on Saturday night, she said the Greens' wins could prompt Labor and the Coalition to negotiate more around policies. ""What it may actually deliver, though, is the fact that the two major parties may just have to start working a little more closely together to get sensible policy because I don't think Australians necessarily would like to see some of the policies of the Greens put into place by the Labor Party,"" she said. ""I think there is going to have to be a … new relationship between the two major parties to make sure we do get sensible policy, because we can get some pretty crazy policy if you're relying on the Greens to support Labor.""

48,How a dolphin trainer from Malaysia snatched the prize Liberal seat of Tangney from Scott Morrison's confidant,politics,"  Former dolphin trainers do not usually become MPs but, in a federal election where most political conventions seem to have been thrown out the window, it seems entirely appropriate that one has been elected in Western Australia. Meet Sam Lim, whose unlikely election victory over Scott Morison's close friend and adviser Ben Morton in the Perth seat of Tangney came as a  bolt out of the blue to almost everyone. Mr Morton had been widely expected to hold onto the outer suburban seat in Perth's southern mortgage belt, which he held with a comfortable margin of 9.5 per cent. But that was before a tidal wave of red swept over Western Australia, which saw Labor not only pick up the seats it felt it had a reasonable chance of winning —Pearce, Swan, Hasluck — but also Tangney. where it had not even dared hope for victory. Mr Lim, who migrated to Australia in 2002, detailed his unusual journey to represent the people of Tangney in federal parliament as he addressed the media on Sunday morning. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog One of eight children who grew up ""in a very poor family"", Mr Lim said his childhood home had a leaky roof, dirt floor and no running water ""So we had to struggle for the first 15 years of my life,"" he said. ""But that 15 years built me up to today. ""When I had to fight to win this seat, I utilised all that determination that I gained in the first 15 years of my life and I achieved it."" Mr Lim's childhood dream was to join the police force, but police pay rates were so low in Malaysia that, which led him to apply for ""my best job ever"" - that of dolphin trainer at a safari park. ""I loved it because dolphins are so genuine,"" he said. ""Dolphins never hurt you. If you feel hurt you jump into the swimming pool and the dolphin will come to you and try to comfort you. ""That was my best part of my career."" But when creditors moved in on the safari park, Mr Lim had to farewell his beloved dolphins, a time he described as one of mixed emotions. ""[It was] the worst part of my career at that time because we had to say goodbye to them, but we feel very happy they are back to their home,"" he recalled. From there, Mr Lim moved into small business and he attributed his success to his ""good karma"", which he said led to ""a lot of people … supporting me"". His success in business enabled him to move to Australia with his young family, which he described as ""a wild world …  a totally different world"". Despite his business success, Mr Lim's childhood dream of joining the police force continued to haunt him, and so he joined the WA Police in 2006. ""[Being] a police officer is a great job, I love the blue uniform,"" he said. In December 2020, Mr Lim, who speaks 10 languages, was awarded WA Police's highest accolade, its officer of the year award for his work with multicultural communities during the pandemic. Soon after, he was approached by Labor to run in Tangney. Having unexpectedly won the seat, Mr Lim is not shy of ambition. ""There is a big challenge for me to do better and I hope the Labor Party can be there for the next 45 years,"" he said.

49,A bad moon is rising and this is another dying gasp of an old order,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The poet Matthew Arnold wrote: ""The bridge is cross'd, and slow we ride."" That sums up this election. Arnold's poem Stanzas from the Grande Chartreusse was his quest for meaning in a world without faith. It perfectly captures the mood of our political times. Labor has crossed the bridge into government but with no great mandate, no sweeping reform, no grand vision. This is less a resounding vote for Labor — a dismal primary vote below 32 per cent — than a reflection of disillusioned voters, fed up with politics as usual and departing in droves from the major parties. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog This is a slow ride. Anthony Albanese charts rough seas. ""The autumnal evening darkens round, ""The wind is up, and drives the rain."" We are living through ""A dead time's exploded dream"". Liberal democracy around the world is battered. It is exhausted. It appears out of ideas. Australia's election campaign stumbled to a close with Albanese and Scott Morrison acting more like mortgage brokers trying to sell us a house. Buy now, pay later. We will even stump you the deposit or let you raid your super. That's what neoliberalism has delivered us: a ""what's in it for me"" election with no enthusiasm for major parties and no serious discussion of what really ails us. Western liberal democracy throughout the 20th century was built on two great ideas: the New Deal that drove American politics from the 1930s to 1980 and neoliberalism that promised a post-Cold-War world of market-driven globalisation and technological advancement, removal of barriers to trade and erasing borders: free movement of goods and people. It is the end of the Morrison government in an election which — while it might not have resulted in a landslide for the Opposition — has seen the conservative party decimated and shattered. The New Deal built on a compact between workers and business with a strong social safety net that helped fend off the appeal of socialism or communism. Stagflation of the 1970s — a mix of high inflation, low growth and high unemployment — dealt a death blow to the New Deal. By the time the Berlin Wall came down, that era was over. Neoliberalism appeared triumphant. Economies grew, poverty was reduced, progressive parties like Bob Hawke's Labor in Australia, later Tony Blair's Labour in Britain and Bill Clinton's Democrats in the US married their social agenda with the market-dominated economics of Britain's Margaret Thatcher and America's Ronald Reagan. As stagflation mortally wounded the New Deal, the global financial crash badly damaged neoliberalism. People felt abandoned and left behind. Inequality has skyrocketed. In the United States especially this has fractured the polity. Neoliberalism's faith in the market eroded communities. A cleavage has emerged between rural and urban populations — what British political writer David Goodhart called ""somewheres and anywheres"". This divide has driven political earthquakes like the Brexit vote and the Trump presidency in the US. Historian Gary Gerstle tracks this phenomenon in his book The Rise and Fall of the Neoliberal Order. He says: ""Losing the capacity to exercise ideological hegemony signals a political order's decline."" Neoliberalism does not exercise ideological hegemony. Its fall has coincided with a democratic recession worldwide marked by an erosion of freedom, loss of faith in institutions, and democratic capture by autocratic strongmen. Globally there has been a coming apart. Identity is key. Democracy has been marked by tribal culture wars. Neoliberalism was founded on a paradoxical alliance of free-market ideology with what Gerstle called ""neo-Victorianism"" driven by the socially conservative religious right. Several well-funded independents ran against established Liberals on a promise of climate action and government integrity. Here's how the night has turned out for them. On the left, Gerstle says black rights groups, feminism and multiculturalism also flourished in the neoliberal order which disrupted traditions and promoted hybridity and cosmopolitanism. The fracturing of the neoliberal order though has broken the identity wars wide open. The marginalised have occupied the centre. Liberalism doesn't speak to them. In some cases, these movements seek to up-end liberalism itself. Black Lives Matter is an example, breaking with the old civil rights leadership of the Martin Luther King Jr era. As one of the movement's key figures, Alicia Garza, said: ""The model of the black preacher leading people to the promised land isn't working right now."" Urgency and anger drive these movements that will not wait. They have heard it all before. Rawlsian liberalism, with its ""veil of ignorance"", neutrality and weightlessness, cannot bear the weight being put upon it by groups who feel abandoned or left behind. From the left to the right, identity groups are focused on disruption as much as change. It is about protest as much or even more than policy. The end of neoliberalism has created a void but few answers. It is a long death with the old guard of politics clinging to the corpse of neoliberalism, trying to breathe life into it. Here a wave of protest has washed over our federal election. The people are speaking, yet political leaders hear only what they want. Scott Morrison praised the strength of our democracy, and rightly so, yet this democracy has turfed him out not for what he has done but what he has not done. A vote against Morrison is not a vote for Albanese. The new prime minister says there was a mood for change but it is not Labor's change. It is change out of frustration. It is a cri de coeur. It is wrong to think this is all about a personal rejection of Morrison — that is part of it — or that Albanese will be a saviour. It is another dying gasp of an old order. It is a vote for change, but where is our purpose? Has it delivered us a parliament for the trying times ahead? A bad moon is rising. War is raging in Ukraine, and we are being told to prepare for war in our region. The world is in an inflationary cycle driving up interest rates and that will feed into higher unemployment. Supply chains are being disrupted. We are facing trillion-dollar debt. It will cost more to pay it back. China is recasting our world, an authoritarian superpower that is on track to be the biggest economy in the world. It is expanding its reach into what Australia considers its sphere of influence, the Pacific. The Solomons-China security pact has been a wake-up call. The 21st century will be defined by the big power rivalry between China and the United States. It will determine everything from the global economy to conflict to climate change. Does a parliament with a teal-coloured crossbench, more Greens, and a small-target Labor government have the answers to this age? We can hope so. More voices may bring more ideas. Anthony Albanese says he has always been underestimated. Let's hope so because Australia needs more from him than he has shown. His personal story of humble beginnings to The Lodge is inspiring and speaks to his strength and determination. Albanese now has a window to lead and to embrace the hard questions he avoided during the campaign. Yes, he presented a small target, but he is not without a mandate. He can grasp the opportunity for change on climate policy and finally take an Indigenous constitutional voice to a referendum. But he has little time to move and little space to manoeuvre. As Bob Dylan wrote: ""The line it is drawn, the curse it is cast."" Leadership in these times is as much a curse as a blessing. The order is rapidly fading. The answer does not come from resuscitating the old neoliberal order. It is gone, but we have nothing to replace it.

50,"For the first time, two Indigenous women are expected to represent the NT in the Senate",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Two Indigenous women on opposite sides of the political spectrum look set to represent the Northern Territory in the Senate. Both of the NT's Senate spots are expected to be won by Indigenous women for the first time Malarndirri McCarthy says she's excited about Labor's plan for a referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament The CLP's Jacinta Price says the country has been ""taken for a ride"" by the left side of politics Labor and the Country Liberals, as expected, have secured the bulk of first preference votes in the contest for the NT's two Upper House spots. It means Labor Senator Malarndirri McCarthy is predicted to retain her seat, with the Country Liberals candidate Jacinta Nampijinpa Price all but certain of joining her in Canberra. For Ms McCarthy — a Yanyuwa woman from the Gulf region who entered the Senate in 2016 — it will be her first experience as a member of a Labor government. She said incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese's commitment to embrace the Uluru Statement from the Heart was particularly important. ""I'm incredibly excited by the opportunity that federal Labor will have now to ensure that we do have [an Indigenous] Voice enshrined in the constitution to the Australian parliament,"" she said at a Labor election party in Darwin on Saturday night. Once the election results are finalised, Ms McCarthy said Labor's First Nations caucus members would get together to ensure a referendum on an Indigenous Voice takes place as soon as possible. ""There's no doubt there is a great sense of relief, but also vindication for federal Labor that our hard work, certainly since 2019, to bring the policies that matter to all Australians need to now be adhered to and acted on quite quickly."" Ms Price — a Warlpiri-Celtic woman and former deputy mayor of Alice Springs — said Australians had been ""taken for a ride"" by The Greens and others on the left side of politics. ""And they're going to soon find out what bed they have made for themselves,"" she told a CLP gathering in Alice Springs. She said it was ""concerning"" Labor had been swept into office and that ""Australia needs us now more than ever"". ""You can take some comfort in knowing that the bulldog in me is not going to stop."" In 2019, Ms Price ran an unsuccessful campaign to dislodge Labor veteran Warren Snowdon from his Lower House seat of Lingiari, which has the country's highest proportion of First Nations voters. Labor's Marion Scrymgour and the Country Liberal Party's Damien Ryan are locked in a tight contest for the traditionally safe Labor seat. On Saturday, she levelled criticism at Mr Snowdon, who retired ahead of this year's election. ""He sat there for 30 bloody years … with the people who are the most marginalised in this country, in his electorate, and he's done bugger all for them,"" she said. ""There's still people in the bush suffering. So there's still a hell of a lot of work to be done."" Mr Snowdon dismissed Ms Price's criticism. ""I don't regard what she has said as having any credibility,"" he said. ""She contested the federal election against me in 2019 and was resoundingly defeated. ""I would make the observation that it's the last decade that the Liberals have been in power and it failed First Nations people across the country, most particularly in the NT."" Last year, Ms Price was pre-selected as the CLP's Senate candidate after winning a battle against former Senator Sam McMahon. Dr McMahon later joined the Liberal Democrats to run for the Senate in this year's election.

51,'It's the national electorate that's breaking apart': Antony Green on the election result,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Australia has a new prime minister, but Labor's path to victory has been unlike any election in history. With a sea of teal independents winning seats on climate change and anti-corruption platforms and a swing towards the Greens in some capital cities, it seems clear that Australia's appetite for the two major parties has diminished. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog This is reflected in the primary vote count, which will see Labor form government with just around a third of first-preference votes. As of Sunday afternoon, they had  secured at least 71 seats — under the required 76 to form a majority government. ABC chief election analyst Anthony Green has covered more than 90 elections. Here he takes us through the key takeaways — and some of the still unanswered questions. We've never seen support for the major parties drop so low at a federal level before. The nearest comparison would be One Nation's breakthrough in Queensland in 1998. In countries with comparable electoral systems, like Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, we saw the support for the long-dominate parties starting to subside in the 1970s and 1980s. That didn't happen in Australia — the '70s saw a polarisation. I think compulsory voting has added an inertia to the way our political system works and has prevented a decline in the major party vote. What last night's result shows is that the two major parties are no longer represented across all parts of the country. There was a time when both major parties would get a substantial majority of the vote in every seat. People are looking at the national vote level, and missing the fact that the change is occurring at a much lower level; there are parts of cities where Labor's votes have disappeared, and there are parts of the country where the Liberals and Nationals did very poorly and the independents did well. It's the national electorate that's breaking apart. Realistically, the only third party is the Greens. They received 12 per cent of the vote nationally. One Nation and the United Australia Party got between 4 and 5 per cent each. At 12 per cent and with concentrated support in particular areas, the Greens are able to win individual electorates and with their level of vote, they're able to elect senators. When the Greens' Adam Bandt won Melbourne in 2010, it was the first time a minor party had won a House of Representatives seat in a general election since before the war. They've now won several. But while they've got huge success in inner-city seats, they are a negligible force in large parts of Australia. As for One Nation and Clive Palmer's United Australia Party, there hasn't been anything significant. One Nation's vote rose because it stood three times as many candidates. If you look only at the seats it contested last time, its vote fell. Clive Palmer's vote is only slightly higher than last election. One Nation and the United Australia Party's impact will be with their preferences, and we're not exactly sure what those are. The rest of the shift is support for independents, with the highest number of independents ever seen set to enter parliament. Candidates with significant profiles and backing are able to win seats on the right issues. (Independents have so far won 11 seats, with the Greens on track to take four.) An oddity was, one of the independents that I thought had the best chance of winning, Rob Priestly in the Victorian seat of Nicholls, wasn't able to take the seat from the Nationals. People were critical that the teal independents — a group of female candidates running on similar platforms of climate change and a federal anti-corruption body — were getting so much more coverage than other independents but look at, say, Dai Le in Fowler who won over Labor's Kristina Keneally. She was just a local independent, she wasn't a movement, she wasn't undermining the party system — she was a local independent complaining about Labor selection processes. The teal independents are a broader movement and they have had enormous success. No. One or other of the traditional parties will continue to form government. The son of a single mother, born into a life in public housing, Anthony Albanese has achieved his life-long wish of becoming Prime Minister. New Zealand moved to proportional representation in the 1990s — a system that gives the public two votes, one for their local member and another for the party they want to see in government — and the two traditional parties are still the only parties that can form government. They can take partners on, but they're still the only two parties capable of forming government. The Greens have got significant inroads, but they will still not form government. They will be in the parliament, they may as members have a say on government policies — they'll say yay or nay — but in the end, they're not the party of government. The two outcomes possible out of this election are a Labor majority or Labor minority government. If the former, it will be a very small majority. Both will be as stable as each other, it doesn't make a difference to some extent. Labor will talk to the Greens, they will talk to these crossbenchers. The crossbench will probably demand action on climate change and on an Independent Commission Against Corruption — Labor has a commitment to both. It's a question of whether it's a stronger or weaker commitment. Several well-funded independents ran against established Liberals on a promise of climate action and government integrity. Here's how the night has turned out for them. Looking at Australian state parliaments over the past two-and-a-half decades, the Labor Party has consistently shown itself better able to deal with crossbenchers, while the Coalition has struggled when they've been put in minority government positions. You look at the success of the Labor government in South Australia, Victoria's Steve Bracks coming to government in 1999, the Carr government in NSW at various times, and the Beattie government in Queensland — all had various periods where there were alliances on the crossbench and they all managed to move along. The federal Gillard minority government had a more mixed problem — and in some senses, their problem wasn't the crossbench but the perception that they had backflipped on an election policy. That was their undoing. If all the Greens and independents vote against legislation, the Labor Party could lose things but they're not going to be brought down. The Coalition is not forming government in that parliament, there's no opportunity to do so. What is more likely to happen is that Labor will talk to selected independents if they're after votes on certain issues. It will be an interesting job for the Leader of the House. No, but the total major party vote has never been so low, either. A parliament is elected, and a government will be formed. People have voted in 151 electorates and have elected 151 members to the parliament, and that parliament will resolve a government. The Australian people have spoken, so how did it all unfold? The Labor Party had a low vote, but there was a 12 per cent vote for the Greens. There is a significant loss of seats by the Liberal Party to independents with policies the Coalition didn't support. People say there hasn't been a shift from the Coalition to Labor, that the public isn't wedded to that agenda. Well, no there isn't. But the fact is there's a whole swag of new members of that parliament that want action on climate change and action on corruption commissions, which the Coalition wasn't offering and Labor is offering a version of it. That's what the Australian electorate has elected. It might not be from one party, but that's what the public voted on. The caveat is there's a vast gulf between the cities and results in the country. This result has shown the starkest cleavage between city and country that we've seen in a long while on very fundamental issues like climate change policy. We've seen extraordinary sweeping change across the capital cities. And this is not just Greens and independents. In Western Australia, it's all been for Labor, the Liberals don't hold a seat in Adelaide, they might hold one in Perth, and they may hold only three in Melbourne. Apart from Scott Morrison's seat of Cook, the Liberals hold no seats that border the harbour or the coast between Pittwater and Botany Bay in Sydney — which is just unfathomable given past history of voting patterns in Sydney. In Brisbane, there are three inner-city seats set to be won by the Greens. You couldn't have a party more at odds with what people in regional Queensland want. The difference in Queensland is starkest between city and country, but it's there across the rest of the country as well. Because the major party vote was so low, it was difficult to determine the final two candidates in seats. Also, where new independents were running, we didn't have a preference count history for most of those seats, which makes it difficult to use our method of calling seats based on preference counts. We had to call it on first preferences. Normally, I've had to deal with two or three of those situations at an election, not 15. Going forward, it may be that this election was a particularly difficult one. If the major party vote continues to decline, then we will continue to see more of these sorts of results. There are ways we can make our software more sophisticated to deal with these sorts of things. We changed our software back in the 1990s when we started to get more of these contests that weren't two party. When you're getting first preference votes, and then you're getting actual preference votes, there's a complexity of detail that's difficult to keep on top of. The most interesting thing was that we've had six weeks of political commentary naming seats as key battlegrounds, and some of them were complete rubbish. For example, the Labor Party easily held Corangamite and easily held McEwen. And for all the talk of Western Australia, Labor had huge swings. There was talk that Labor might only win two seats, and they've won five. It was a wipe-out in Western Australia and it will allow a Labor government to take office. The main takeaway, however, is that there has been a substantial rejection of the Coalition government that has not necessarily translated to an embrace of the Labor government. But it has definitely translated into new members elected who want something done about climate change and a corruption commission. So it's a definite shift in policy from the members elected. There'll be some finalisation of the pre-poll voting count today. On Monday, the Australian Electoral Commission will start to re-throw the seats where they have the wrong preference count. And probably, by Tuesday or Wednesday, we'll have a much clearer result. But some seats will take to the very end, in two weeks' time.

52,Ben Morton thinks the Liberals' WA bloodbath is down to McGowan's popularity — but Labor thinks otherwise ,politics,"  Close Scott Morrison confidante and outgoing Member for Tangney Ben Morton has conceded the popularity of Premier Mark McGowan was a significant factor in Labor's haul of seats in Western Australia and the Liberals' decimation. But Labor said that was a failure by the Liberals to take responsibility for their losses. Labor MPs pointed to what they said was the Liberal’s disconnect with the community and taking the state for granted, especially when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called West Australians “cave people” and sided with businessman Clive Palmer over the state’s closed border. In perhaps the most stunning result of any state in the election, Labor picked up at least four seats from the Liberals in Western Australia — Swan, Pearce, Hasluck and Tangney — with a massive state-wide swing of more than 10 per cent. Mr Morton, Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet in the Morrison government, had not been expected to lose his seat but, in a shock result, suffered a swing of more than 13 per cent to Labor's Sam Lim, with more than 66 per cent of the vote counted. ""I think Mark McGowan was absolutely a factor in this election campaign, we haven't seen the swings that we've seen in the last state election occur,"" Mr Morton said. ""So less of a factor this time, less of a swing to the Labor party that we saw at the last state election. But one that obviously goes against the Liberal Party in WA."" There has also been a swing of more than 11 per cent to the Labor party in the once-safe Liberal seat of Moore, in Perth's north, and it is now too close to call. If the Liberals were to lose Moore, it would leave them with no seats in the metropolitan area, with the ABC computer also predicting a win for independent Kate Chaney in the previously-blue ribbon seat of Curtin. Liberal Andrew Hastie's seat of Canning, just beyond the southern and south-eastern edge of the Perth metropolitan area and once held by a comfortable 11.6 per cent buffer, has been reduced to a marginal seat. Mr Morton said he had not yet turned his attention to what went wrong in Western Australia or how the party should change in the west. But in the seat of Hasluck, which had been held by Ken Wyatt, Minister for Indigenous Australians in the Morrison government, some Liberals at his post-election function had strong views. Some Liberals told the ABC they were angry with what they saw as a lack of party support for Liberal candidate Celia Hammond in Curtin, who held the seat for one term after taking over from former foreign minister Julie Bishop. Ms Hammond was not Ms Bishop's choice to replace her, but was instead the pick of former finance minister and WA Liberal powerbroker Matthias Cormann. Others expressed amazement at the result so far in Moore and were particularly critical of the ongoing influence of ""the Clan"" within the party, an informal group of Liberal conservatives including Mr Cormann, state Upper House MPs Peter Collier and Nick Goiran and Ian Goodenough, the incumbent federal MP in Moore. There was also a belief expressed to the ABC by some Liberals in Hasluck that the federal Liberals had failed to effectively explain what the Morrison government had done to address climate change issues. In Curtin, Ms Chaney was one of the teal independents in previously heartland Liberal seats who campaigned on climate change and appealed to dissatisfaction among voters with the way the Liberal party had evolved. ""Whatever happens, the Liberal Party will need to spend some time thinking about who and what it stands for,"" she said. ""We do know that communities care, including this community, about climate, corruption, long-term economic thinking and social inclusion. ""We do know there is a place for optimism in Australian politics. Whatever happens next, I now feel optimistic about the ability of community to drive change, to be heard and to make things better."" Labor's clearly overjoyed newly-elected MPs fronted the media on the South Perth foreshore on Sunday. Incoming member for Swan Zaneta Mascarenhas said voters did not like what the Coalition offered. ""It's been a pretty amazing ride we had last night and a better future starts today,"" she said. ""The truth is Mark McGowan showed what leadership looks like in a crisis, Scott Morrison didn't."" There will now be at least nine federal Labor MPs from Western Australia, and potentially 10 if Tom French wins Moore. Tracey Roberts, who has been elected in Pearce, said the community sent a strong message about the Morrison government's performance. ""On the doors and talking and engaging with people, they sensed a very strong sense of disconnect,"" Ms Roberts said. Perth MP Patrick Gorman said Sunday was not the day to give the WA Liberals advice on how to rebuild from the ground up, but he did lay out why voters punished them. ""What we have seen is a very clear message, that you do not take this state for granted, you do not treat this state the way Scott Morrison and the Liberal party have for the last few years,"" he said. ""We've said it a million times, but they did call us cave people, they did side with Clive Palmer against Western Australia."" Senior West Australian Labor MP Madeleine King, who holds the seat of Brand, said the extra WA representation would be heard in government, after a quick rest following the long campaign. ""Maybe go and watch the footy this afternoon, have a bit of a lie down,"" she said. ""But tomorrow the work really starts … standing up for Western Australia, I hope, into the very long-term future."" Incoming Hasluck MP Tania Lawrence said the three key issues she would fight for in her electorate were aged care neglect, for both residents and workers, cost of living pressures, and a focus on women and affordable childcare costs.

53,These are the Victorian seats on a knife edge as the vote count continues,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The Liberal Party is battling to hold onto key seats in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, while Labor is edging ahead in a tough contest with the Greens for the inner-city electorate of Macnamara. National swings away from the Coalition have been replicated in Victoria, helping Labor sweep to victory. It is not yet clear whether Labor will get enough seats to form an outright majority or whether it will need to negotiate with a crossbench dominated by ""teal"" independents and Greens MPs. A number of key Victorian seats may decide whether incoming Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will govern with a majority or minority government. Menzies straddles the upper Yarra River and outer-eastern Melbourne suburbs such as Bulleen, Warrandyte, Doncaster, Donvale and Bulleen. The electorate has only been held by two members since it was created in 1984 — former Liberal Party deputy leader Neil Brown and retiring MP Kevin Andrews, who was the MP since 1991. Until this election, it had been considered a safe Liberal seat and was held by Mr Andrews on a comfortable 7 per cent margin at the last vote. But a massive swing away from the Coalition meant Liberal candidate Keith Wolahan and Labor's Naomi Oakley were neck and neck when voting closed on Saturday night. Eyes are also on Deakin, covering suburbs like Forest Hill, Vermont, Heathmont, Ringwood and Croydon. As counting closed on Saturday night, the race between outgoing assistant treasurer and housing minister Michael Sukkar and Labor challenger Matt Gregg was too close to call. The Liberal Party has also faced a swing against it in nearby Casey, which was vacated by outgoing Liberal MP Tony Smith. With more than 70 per cent of the vote counted, Liberal candidate Aaron Violi was still on track to win the seat for his party. Victorian seats where Labor lost ground to the Liberal Party on a two-party basis included Scullin, La Trobe and Holt, as well as the new seat of Hawke. This is despite the Liberal Party seeing a reduced primary vote, instead making gains on preferences from minor parties including United Australia Party and One Nation. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The swing in Menzies is representative of the picture in other seats spanning formerly blue-blood Liberal heartland. Menzies shares its western border with Kooyong, which the ABC has called as lost by outgoing treasurer Josh Frydenberg to independent ""teal"" challenger Monique Ryan. Mr Frydenberg has not officially conceded but acknowledged it would be ""very, very difficult"" to retain the seat. The nearby seat of Higgins has also left Liberal hands for the first time since it was created in 1949, with infectious diseases physician Michelle Ananda-Rajah claiming victory for Labor over the Liberals' Katie Allen. And in Goldstein, which takes in wealthy bayside suburbs like Brighton in Melbourne's south-east, another ""teal"" independent Zoe Daniel has claimed victory over Liberal Tim Wilson in a historic win. Chisholm, which has changed hands between the Liberal and Labor parties over recent decades, has been comfortably won by Labor's Carina Garland. Alongside the teal independents, the Australian Greens have been another clear winner of the 2022 vote. Leader Adam Bandt has been comfortably returned to his seat of Melbourne. The party is also hopeful of picking up another Lower House seat in Macnamara, which takes in inner-south-east Melbourne suburbs like Port Melbourne and St Kilda. Labor's Josh Burns was ahead by more than 3 per cent when voting stopped on Saturday night, but the Greens' Steph Hodgins-May secured a more than 7 per cent increase in her party's primary vote in the seat. In Melbourne's inner-north, Labor comfortably retained Cooper and Wills, but the Greens' primary vote picked up significantly in both those seats. In the Queensland electorate of Ryan, which covers leafy western suburbs of Auchenflower, Indooroopilly and Ashgrove in Brisbane, the Greens' Elizabeth Watson-Brown has defeated Liberal Julian Simmonds. The Greens' Max Chandler-Mather is ahead in Griffith and Stephen Bates is also in front in the seat of Brisbane.

54,Liberal MP James Stevens pulls ahead of Labor's Sonja Baram in Sturt,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The Liberal Party is almost 400 votes ahead on a two-party preferred basis in what had been the safe seat of Sturt, in Adelaide's eastern suburbs. Labor's Sonja Baram was leading by 0.6 per cent (or 890 votes) when counting finished last night, but after counting until 4pm ACST today, Liberal MP James Stevens was 386 votes ahead. The vote had been neck-and-neck in the morning. Mr Stevens first won the electorate in 2019 following the retirement of Christopher Pyne. It had a 6.9 per cent margin in 2019, putting it outside the realm of what is usually considered a marginal seat. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Last night, Ms Baram said voters wanted to be listened to. ""I'm surprised by the swing but I've been working really hard, you know, having one-on-one conversations and when I'm talking to people, they're saying what they want and it is not what the Liberal Party was delivering — absolutely not,"" she said. Mr Stevens last night said he believed he had done enough to hold on, despite the big swing against him. ""I haven't won it yet,"" he said. ""I intend to and hope to win the seat, but I think we'll need to wait a few days before I can properly claim victory."" Labor appears to have won Boothby with a margin of more than 3 per cent, although Liberal Rachel Swift has not yet conceded. Labor's Louise Miller-Frost leads by almost 6,000 votes with only one polling place yet to have its ballots counted. Premier Peter Malinauskas said it was a win for his party. ""It looks as though, for the first time since 1946, Labor has won the seat of Boothby,"" he said. ""That's a very significant showing and one that speaks to the culture of South Australian Labor, and regardless of showings and affiliations we get around one another.""

55,Liberals looking for new leader after Morrison takes responsibility for loss,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Liberal politicians have begun jostling to replace outgoing Prime Minister Scott Morrison as party leader after Labor seized government from the Coalition. Mr Morrison on Saturday night took responsibility for the loss and said he would step down as Liberal leader. The biggest Liberal losses in the election were to independent women, the ""teal"" candidates, who were running on integrity and climate policies. Party insiders say Defence Minister Peter Dutton is the frontrunner to be the next Liberal leader. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's likely loss in his once-safe Melbourne seat has thrown open the leadership battle since he was most likely to lead the Liberals in opposition. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Queensland MP Karen Andrews called a Sunday morning press conference where she talked about her national security credentials and said it was time for her party to reflect on the loss. She said it was ""way too early to have a discussion about leadership"" when asked if she would nominate for the position. ""I am not commenting on any leadership speculation,"" she said. Ms Andrews was among the first women to speak out about the culture in her party, saying she had ""had a gutful"" when revelations emerged about the treatment of women in Parliament House. Party sources suggested Trade Minister Dan Tehan and Industry Minister Angus Taylor were also possible candidates. When Ms Andrews first entered politics, she beat Mr Dutton in pre-selection when he was seeking to shift from his marginal Brisbane seat of Dickson to the safer Gold Coast seat of McPherson. Mr Frydenberg, once seen as a future Liberal prime minister, looks set to be the biggest victim of the Coalition's loss but has left open the possibility of returning to politics. ""I still have fire in my belly,"" he said. The outgoing deputy leader said his party needed to get more women into Liberal ranks and that Australia had not been served well by culture wars on climate change. The bulk of Liberals to lose their seats to independents are moderates. Finance Minister Simon Birmingham, the leader of the moderates, also backed the need for more women. He said on Sunday morning that the Liberals needed to go further on tackling climate change. ""When you then look at where we have lost and particularly traditionally heartland seats, that is perhaps the loudest message to the Liberal Party and it's the one we are going to have to heed most strongly,"" he said. How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' Mr Morrison's hand-picked candidate in a once-safe Liberal seat, Katherine Deves, attracted headlines throughout the campaign for anti-trans comments. She was comfortably defeated by independent Zali Steggall, who secured a second term representing Warringah. Senator Birmingham said Ms Deves's candidacy proved damaging to moderate Liberals, particularly Trent Zimmerman in the neighbouring seat of North Sydney. ""They are being punished by association with candidates in adjacent seats, and in Trent's case there are no more adjacent seats than North Sydney and Warringah,"" he said on Saturday night. ""So you are seeing a real contagion effect. ""That’s a real devastating blow because it is people like Trent who we need to make sure the party rebuilds the vote in the communities that we have clearly lost and the voters we have clearly lost, and yet we’re going to be missing some of those crucial people.""

56,Kristina Keneally concedes defeat in seat held by Labor since 1984,politics,"  Former NSW Labor premier, frontbencher and outgoing senator Kristina Keneally has conceded defeat in the south-west seat of Fowler. The seat, held by the Labor Party since its creation in 1984, was one it hoped to keep by parachuting in high-profile Senator Keneally. It will now go to local independent Dai Le, with Labor registering a swing against it of more than 16 per cent. Senator Keneally took to Twitter to announce her defeat. ""At the end of today, it seems that Labor will not claim victory in Fowler,"" she said. ""I congratulate Dai Le and wish her well. ""Thank you to the people who voted Labor & the volunteers on our campaign. And congratulations to Albo & Labor — a better future for Australia lies ahead."" Ms Le, the Deputy Mayor of Fairfield, had earlier today said she was quietly confident of winning, attributing her success to her strong ties to the community. ""I think the Fowler community is saying we are going to have our own voice, we are going to stand up, we're going speak for ourselves."" ""They [voters] knew Kristina Keneally as a NSW Labor party leader who led them to their most significant loss and the fact she lived in Scotland Island, even though she claims to live in Liverpool,"" she added. ""A lot of people are telling me they are sick and tired of major parties, and people are telling me Kristina Keneally is not connected to this community — she has no roots here."" Labor deputy leader Richard Marles said Senator Keneally had fought for the people of NSW for her entire political career. ""She [Senator Keneally] was very excited about representing the people of Fowler given the opportunity. We have not conceded it and whatever plays out there, we will work through the lessons of it."" Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The decision to place her into Fowler to solve an internal party battle over who would get the top spot on Labor's NSW Senate ticket, attracted controversy at the time. Retiring member Chris Hayes had initially thrown his support behind Vietnamese Australian lawyer Tu Le to represent the diverse electorate. Mr Hayes later said he accepted the decision of the party and Senator Keneally said he had been supportive since she was endorsed. ""There was certainly a lot of anger out in the seat of Fowler with regards to Tu Le, the Labor candidate who is of Vietnamese background, being overlooked and Kristina parachuted into that seat,"" said Liberal senator Hollie Hughes on Channel Ten's election night coverage, as results started to swing towards Ms Le. ""I don't think Dai Le would have run had it been Tu Le and I think that's where the anger's come from. Frank Carbone certainly wouldn't have engaged in the way that he has, he's a very popular local mayor."" Labor's Ed Husic, also an MP in Western Sydney, told Channel Ten Ms Le's strong local profile gave her an edge. ""I think in the case of Kristina, Dai Le is a very well-known local candidate so that was a very tough contest,"" he said. Ms Le was backed by popular local mayor Mr Carbone, who has appeared on much of her campaign material in a long-standing but unusual political marriage. In 2016, she was suspended from the Liberal Party for a decade after running as an independent in the Fairfield mayoral race, and Mr Carbone was kicked out of the ALP for doing the same. He was re-elected Mayor in that election. Prior to that, Ms Le had run for Liberals in the state seat of Cabramatta, reducing Labor's margin to 2.1 per cent at the 2011 election. Both Ms Le and Mr Carbone are well-known and popular faces around the area, having been prominent voices during the strict Western Sydney Delta lockdown last year. Her campaign has been centred on the fact she is a local who lived through the harsh lockdown alongside voters. After a difficult 12 months, some of those who campaigned locally said there was still anger about the inequitable treatment of Western Sydney communities during the lockdown, and the selection of Senator Keneally. It's understood the Keneally camp felt she had been warmly welcomed by the community, while not taking a win in the seat for granted. Ms Le came to Australia as a refugee when she was 11, and is a prominent member of the local Vietnamese community. According to the 2016 census, 16 per cent of the community has Vietnamese ancestry. Despite suspending her from the party, the Liberals preferenced Ms Le on their how- to-vote cards in Fowler. Their candidate, Courtney Nguyen, campaigned locally, but was largely absent from media coverage of the local race.

57,'Teal revolution' to push Labor on climate targets as defeated Liberals take stock,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Incoming ""teal"" independent MPs have flagged their willingness to work with Labor in the event of a hung parliament, but say they will push the party on stronger emissions reduction targets. Monique Ryan is projected to win the leafy Melbourne electorate of Kooyong from outgoing treasurer Josh Frydenberg — the first time the formerly blue-blood seat will leave Liberal hands since it was created. On Sunday morning, Mr Frydenberg said he was waiting for about 16,000 postal votes to be counted before he conceded the seat formerly held by Liberal leaders Robert Menzies and Andrew Peacock. ""But as I said very clearly last night, while it is mathematically possible that we retain Kooyong, it obviously looks very, very difficult indeed,"" he said. ""I've worked as hard as I could in my role as the member for Kooyong, which has been an absolute privilege to serve my community … that being said, when the tide goes out, it doesn't matter how hard you swim."" The ABC has called the seat for Dr Ryan, who said her team was ""not calling it a win just yet"". Dr Ryan is one of the ""teal"" independents backed by a combination of grassroots support and the Climate 200 group who has swept to claim a number of blue-blood seats. The candidates share broad policy objectives of climate action, federal integrity and equality, especially for women. The nationwide swing against the Coalition, as well as the success of the independents and the Greens, has secured Anthony Albanese enough seats to become the next prime minister. While it is clear the Labor party will be able to form government, it is not yet clear whether the party will be able to do so without crossbench support. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Most of the independents have flagged a willingness to negotiate with either major party. Dr Ryan told the ABC's AM program Mr Albanese would need to be ""prepared to come to the table on effective and immediate action on climate change, and on an ICAC that met with an appropriate model for that"". She confirmed this would mean a 60 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030 — much higher than Labor's current target of a 43 per cent reduction by 2030. Urgent and immediate action is needed worldwide to prevent catastrophic damage from climate change, repeated and successive reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have found. Dr Ryan said she would not offer confidence and supply unless Labor pressed ahead with a more ambitious emissions target. ""We have to have immediate action on climate change. We can't wait,"" she said. ""The Labor party's current target that they've taken to the election is manifestly inadequate. And that, I hope, is the power of the crossbench, that we can drive further action on this most important of issues."" Dr Ryan said Climate 200 convenor Simon Holmes a Court would not be actively involved in her time in Parliament. Zoe Daniel, who took the Melbourne seat of Goldstein from Liberal Tim Wilson, confirmed she would push Labor to legislate an emissions reduction target of 60 per cent by 2030 so the major parties did not have ""wriggle room"" on the goals. She reiterated her four campaign pillars of ""climate, prosperity, integrity and gender equality"" would be her priorities in any negotiations. Mr Wilson conceded defeat on Sunday afternoon and congratulated Ms Daniel on her victory, noting the loss of his seat was part of a wider pattern in inner-city Liberal seats across the country. In Malcolm Turnbull's former seat of Wentworth, Allegra Spender defeated Liberal Dave Sharma. She said the country needed an emissions reduction target of at least 50 per cent by 2030 ""and I'll be using all my power to try to achieve that in this Parliament"". Mr Albanese has flagged his intention to imminently introduce legislation for a federal ICAC. He said the issue of climate change should no longer be controversial, saying ""we have an opportunity now to end the climate wars in Australia"". But he has repeatedly said during the election campaign there would be ""no deals"". The crossbench looks set to be dominated by MPs with strong climate agendas, with at least six of the ""teal"" independents picking up seats and the Greens securing at least two Lower House seats. Dr Ryan said while the teal candidates were ""not a party in any way, shape or form"", she expected to work with the independents and the rest of the crossbench on policy if she was elected. Incoming Labor finance minister Katy Gallagher did not confirm whether the makeup of the crossbench would force a compromise on climate policy. ""We had a clear target in the election campaign, a clear policy, and in government we'll do exactly what we said we would do,"" she said. Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles told Insiders his party was still hopeful it could secure enough seats for a majority but would have to negotiate with a senate crossbench. ""But Anthony [Albanese] is a person who is enormously skilled at bringing people together … we are confident that we can get the agenda through Parliament."" In the New South Wales seat of Mackellar, independent Sophie Scamps comfortably won against Liberal Jason Falinski. Kylea Tink has ousted moderate Trent Zimmerman from North Sydney, and Zali Steggall has kept her seat of Warringah after ousting former prime minister Tony Abbott in 2019. In the west, independent Kate Chaney has claimed victory over Celia Hammond in the formerly safe Liberal seat of Curtin. Several well-funded independents ran against established Liberals on a promise of climate action and government integrity. Here's how the night has turned out for them. While Labor has been the beneficiary of swings against the government, this election has seen a trend away from a two-party system overall. ""It's very, very clear that … there's been a teal revolution at this election,"" Dr Ryan said. Goldstein's Ms Daniel said the victories were because the Liberal Party had ""drifted so far to the right that people didn't feel represented"" and the Labor Party ""has an identity crisis where it has been trying to represent the workers and the inner-city professionals"". How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' Outgoing finance minister Simon Birmingham conceded the Liberal Party lost votes from women and the Coalition would need to think about its emissions reduction stance. ""Given the fact that we are looking like we will exceed that 2030 position of 26 to 28 per cent, of course, we should commit to being able to go further,"" he told Insiders. Mr Frydenberg said he did not believe Australia had been ""well served by the culture wars on climate change"". ""There was obviously a lot of issues that were salient in Kooyong and one of those was climate change, the top of the list for many,"" he said. ""I explained what we were doing, and have done. A lot of people wanted us to do more. And I suspect that that was one of the driving factors behind the result."" He said the success of the teal vote would ""provide lessons for the Coalition"" as to how they tackled climate in the future. In his last press conference as treasurer on Sunday morning, Mr Frydenberg said he was proud of what he and the Coalition had been able to achieve. Mr Frydenberg shepherded the country through the economic fallout of the pandemic and oversaw schemes like JobKeeper. He denied his criticism of the Victorian government's lockdowns was a factor in his defeat.

58,'An opportunity to end the climate wars': Incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese says Labor ready to take charge,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese says Labor is ready to govern after emerging victorious in the federal election, promising Australia now has an opportunity to end ""the climate wars"". Labor will form government, having secured at least 72 seats in the House of Representatives, although it remains unclear whether the party will reach 76 seats and govern in majority, or have to rely on support from the crossbench. The LNP has lost 20 seats, with high-profile MPs Josh Frydenberg, Tim Wilson, Ken Wyatt and Ben Morton all set to leave parliament. The LNP has so far held on to 50 seats. Independents, including several of the high-profile ""teal"" candidates, have won 11 seats. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The Greens are on track to win up to four seats, after receiving a significant increase in their primary vote in areas around Brisbane which have been subject to flooding. Counting will resume on Sunday, with 14 seats still in doubt. Mr Albanese spoke briefly with reporters just after midnight. ""We'll be a good government, we're ready, we're ready to govern,"" Mr Albanese said. Asked about climate change, Mr Albanese said the issue should no longer be controversial in Australia. ""We have an opportunity now to end the climate wars in Australia."" Mr Albanese said Labor's victory was good for multicultural Australia. ""I think it's good … someone with a non-Anglo Celtic surname is the leader in the House of Representatives and that someone with a surname like Wong is the leader of the government in the Senate,"" he said. Mr Albanese is expected to be sworn in on Monday morning, to ensure he can represent Australia at the Quad international leaders meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday. Independent candidate Monique Ryan, who appears likely to win the Victorian seat of Kooyong from Liberal Josh Frydenberg, has told the ABC that Labor's current policy on emissions reductions of 43 per cent by 2030 was ""manifestly inadequate"". She said the party would need to commit to a larger reduction, such as proposed by independent Zali Steggall's climate change bill, in order to win her support on confidence and supply in a hung parliament. ""That's what I would be working towards, an absolute minimum of a 60 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, [and] hoping for more than that,"" Dr Ryan said. ""I think we need to put in place a legislative framework to ensure that no future government can wriggle out of that action on climate change. ""We have to have immediate action on climate change, we can't wait for the Labor Party's current target that they've taken to the election, it's manifestly inadequate."" Incoming finance minister Katy Gallagher said Labor would implement the climate policies it took to the election. ""Australians want an end to the climate wars and we can do that as a Labor government, we promised that before the election campaign,"" she said. ""We'll implement the plan we took to the election, but it's absolutely clear Australians want to end the climate wars and they want to see real action on climate change, climate policy and all the economic opportunities that will come from having a mature and honest approach to these challenges."" Senator Gallagher wouldn't say if the new government could be pushed for more ambitious reduction targets if they can't form a majority. ""I don't think so, Australians expect their government to do what they said they would do in the campaign,"" she said. ""Of course there's a bit of counting to go, a few seats are too close to call but we're hoping to form majority government."" Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles said his party would not do deals with the crossbench to form government, and was optimistic they could secure a majority. Mr Marles said negotiations to get legislation through would be needed in the Senate regardless of the outcome in the House of Representatives. ""We're really confident that the agenda we've laid out we can get through the Parliament, but Anthony is a person who is enormously skilled at bringing people together,"" Mr Marles said. ""We're not going to do the kind of divisive legislation that we've seen from Scott Morrison over the last decade, which has been aimed at wedging his opponent but dividing the country. Anthony wants to bring the country together again. ""That will be reflected in the way in which we approach the parliament, and we're confident we can get the agenda through the parliament.""

59,Labor's western fairytale came true last night and Mark McGowan had a lot to do with it,politics,"  Pundits had predicted Western Australia could be influential, with the possibility of a swing nearing 5 per cent impacting the national result. But in delivering changes as big as 10 per cent across the board, WA voters have made Labor's wildest dreams come true, and played a key role in taking Anthony Albanese to the Lodge. And some may argue, it came down to one man. For months, Western Australians have been told this election wasn't about the state's wildly-popular Premier Mark McGowan. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog But the election result tells a different story. It tells the story of people who placed their trust in McGowan to lead the state through the most frightening time of this generation. Ever since, they've largely been rewarded for that trust, so when it came time to decide who should next lead the nation, it was little surprise they trusted McGowan's judgement yet again. It's a hard truth even the state's most senior Liberal, and a fierce campaigner, Michaela Cash acknowledged on the night. ""We lived a fundamentally different life to the eastern states … and that has obviously played out tonight,"" she told Channel Seven's election coverage. Labor's western fairytale might have played out very differently though if it weren't for two fateful decisions by Scott Morrison and his government. When he opposed WA's hard border and supported Clive Palmer in his High Court challenge, many West Australians felt it was another example of Canberra being out of touch with the west. Initially, he stood strong on both before backflipping when he realised the political cost of those choices. The Liberal Party looks set to lose four seats in WA, with Curtin in doubt as a huge swing sees WA reject conservative party policies. But the damage was done, presenting easy campaign fodder for Labor, which has been keen to remind voters of both decisions. While most were unanimous that those issues, as part of the broader ""McGowan factor"", would define the election, almost all underestimated by just how much. Some in the Liberal Party had already resigned themselves to losing Swan and Pearce but maintained hope the swing would be less than 5.9 per cent. That would at least mean respected Indigenous Affairs Minister Ken Wyatt could hold onto the seat he has represented for more than a decade. But when Hasluck fell, bad things got worse. Tangney, held on a comfortable margin of 9.5 per cent, was rarely spoken about during the campaign. To see it change hands, from a close friend of Morrison's, Ben Morton, to local police officer Sam Lim, shows just how widespread McGowan's popularity is for voters on both sides of the political divide. But to say the result was only about those factors belittles Western Australian electors. The scare teal independent Kate Chaney was able to deliver in the Liberal stronghold of Curtin gives another insight into voters' minds. With nearly $1 million in donations behind her, Chaney was able to do what many other Climate 200-backed candidates did around the country. They cut through the left-right divide to bring to the fore two issues moderate Liberals felt they weren't being heard on – the need for an independent corruption watchdog, and the need to act on climate change. In a state that's drying out and burning more because of a warming climate, it's little surprise that traction delivered a significant swing in what's usually a Liberal stronghold. Saturday's result is also devastating for the state Liberal Party machine, which has been limping along since last year's landslide state election. That left them with just two Lower House members and forced the party to hand leadership of the Opposition to the Nationals. After being told they were ""headed for the door"" by a scathing internal review in the wake of that result, it seems they've been able to make little progress in changing voters' minds. No doubt Western Australians will be told of the soul searching and reflections WA Liberals will be undertaking in the weeks and months ahead. But having taken another big step towards that proverbial door, the party will have to make some big changes to bring itself back from the brink.

60,Celebrations but lessons for Labor after swings in three Tasmanian seats,politics,"  Regardless of whether Labor manages to form a majority government, it has major lessons to learn from its performance in northern Tasmania. The party has suffered swings against it in Bass, Braddon and Lyons, where two-term MP Brian Mitchell is locked in a tense battle with Liberal challenger Susie Bower. Liberal Gavin Pearce has turned the north-west electorate of Braddon into a safe seat, extending its margin beyond 8 per cent. His challenger, Labor's Chris Lynch, has won just 22 per cent of the primary vote, a huge swing of about 10 per cent against him. Liberal MP Bridget Archer set to become the first politician to win re-election in the seat of Bass in 20 years. In Bass, Liberal Bridget Archer looks to be bucking the trend of instability, becoming the first MP set to be re-elected there in 20 years. With almost 70 per cent of the vote counted, she's narrowly extended a razor-thin 0.4 per cent margin. And in Lyons, where Labor insiders were confident Mr Mitchell would secure a third term, he's just in front but the margin has eroded from 5.2 per cent to 0.2 per cent. Mr Mitchell's primary vote has plummeted below 30 per cent, dropping by a sizeable 7 per cent. It could be looked at as Tasmania retaining the status quo — re-electing all five sitting MPs — but a closer look at the figures reveals a much more worrying picture for the Labor party. Its primary vote has failed to reach 30 per cent (its average across the nation sits at about 32 per cent) in any of the three electorates, despite more than $480 million worth of election promises and repeated visits from the country's next prime minister, Anthony Albanese. It's not clear whether the Labor message and candidates failed to resonate, or the dissatisfaction with the Coalition felt in other states simply didn't exist in Tasmania. In all likelihood, it's probably a combination of both. In Bass, Ms Archer has publicly distanced herself from her party and leader Scott Morrison, regularly denouncing party policy and twice crossing the floor during her first term to vote against the government. Some may say that outspoken nature, which Ms Archer described on election night as ""too real sometimes"", meant voters saw her differently from the other Liberal MPs they voted out around the country. It could also be that Labor's candidate, former MP Ross Hart, simply failed to convince voters he was worthy of a second shot at federal politics. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Mr Lynch, a Burnie councillor with a reasonably low profile, also struggled to convince Braddon voters of the need to change away from Mr Pearce. His chances were likely not also helped by revelations he had been convicted of possessing a trafficable quantity of amphetamine in 1994, when he was 29 years old. But his result leaves the Labor party with lots of headaches and means the seat can no longer be considered marginal at the next federal election. There's a view that the 2019 election result in Lyons, where Mr Mitchell won with a 5.2 per cent margin, was not truly reflective of the mood inside the electorate after his challenger Jessica Whelan was disendorsed by the Liberal Party over anti-Muslim social media posts. Some argued that meant the seat was always likely to be considerably closer this election. But party powerbrokers didn't see it being this close with Mr Mitchell still locked in a fight for his political life at the close of counting on election night. It helps to explain the morose mood of Labor supporters at the party's election function at the Glenorchy Football Club, a world away from the elated party faithful in Sydney during Mr Albanese's victory speech. Labor has plenty of work to do to convince Tasmanians that they're worthy of their votes. But with more than 70 election promises made to the state during the campaign, they'll have lots of opportunities to do it.

Look back on how Sunday's developments unfolded in our blog. By Jessica Riga Thank you for your company today! You can continue to stay up to date here on our Australia Votes website. We'll be back tomorrow to bring you the latest news and reactions as more votes continue to be counted. See you then! By Jessica Riga US President Joe Biden has called Prime Minister-elect Anthony Albanese to congratulate him on his win. Here's a statement from the White House: President Biden reaffirmed the United States' steadfast commitment to the US-Australia alliance and his intent to work closely with the new government to make it stronger still. President Biden expressed deep appreciation for the Prime Minister-Designate's own early commitment to the alliance, reflected in his decision to travel almost immediately to Tokyo to attend the Quad Summit—a vital opportunity to exchange views and continue to drive practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden looks forward to a close partnership between our administrations that will benefit the American people, the Australian people, and the world, starting with consequential meetings in Japan this week. By Jessica Riga Liberal MP's are in discussions about who will form their next leadership team, following last night's federal election loss. Peter Dutton, who's been a senior cabinet minister throughout the Coalition's three terms, is the expected frontrunner. Meanwhile, Anne Ruston, Karen Andrews and Sussan Ley have all been touted as potentials for taking on the role of deputy. Speaking on Sky News, Ms Ley wouldn't say if she would put her hand up, but acknowledged that the party has lost the support of many female voters. ""We need to heed the message that women have told us because as I understand it, many women in the teal seats were not happy with us,"" she said. ""I want to sit down and hear from them. I want to hear what they are not happy about."" Reporting by Stephanie Borys By Jessica Riga  Labor frontbencher Linda Burney says the process is complex but ""will be something that will change our nation."" ""Remember, that is a constitutionally enshrined voice in the Constitution, which requires a referendum. ""We will start at the beginning of a treaty an agreement making process. [It's] complex, and will take a long time. But they have a very firm view in my mind of how we should do that. And, finally, a national process of truth telling. ""This will be something that will change our nation. This will be something that will spark the imagination of everyone. And the support already in the community, in the corporate sector, and in the non-government sector, for an enshrined Voice in the Parliament is just enormous. ""Have a look at the work that has already been done, make sure you consult and talk to the original people that put the Uluru Statement the together. I've already started the process. And make sure that you consult widely on what the question should be, what the timing should be, and, of course, there is a legislative process that we have to go through as well. ""Labor has a First Nations caucus, and that includes the now Attorney-General of Australia, it includes me, and it includes many other people in the Labor Caucus. So we will be using that part of our mechanism to make sure that we are driving forward. And, of course, most importantly, talking to the Shadow Cabinet, talking to the leader, and making sure that we move forward together in terms of this nation-building process."" By Jessica Riga Former dolphin trainers do not usually become MPs but, in a federal election where most political conventions seem to have been thrown out the window, it seems entirely appropriate that one has been elected in Western Australia. Meet Sam Lim, whose unlikely election victory over Scott Morison's close friend and adviser Ben Morton in the Perth seat of Tangney came as a  bolt out of the blue to almost everyone. Mr Morton had been widely expected to hold onto the outer suburban seat in Perth's southern mortgage belt, which he held with a comfortable margin of 9.5 per cent. But that was before a tidal wave of red swept over Western Australia, which saw Labor not only pick up the seats it felt it had a reasonable chance of winning —Pearce, Swan, Hasluck — but also Tangney. where it had not even dared hope for victory. Mr Lim, who migrated to Australia in 2002, detailed his unusual journey to represent the people of Tangney in federal parliament as he addressed the media on Sunday morning. By Jessica Riga After decades of protracted debate over whether the constitution should be amended to give First Nations people more say over their lives, Anthony Albanese's vow to hold a referendum on it is a notable shift, writes Indigenous affairs editor Bridget Brennan. First Nations people are accustomed to being left at the back of the queue during election campaigns, which typically shrug off the shameful inequalities experienced by so many Indigenous voters. So it was a notable shift to hear incoming prime minister Anthony Albanese open his victory speech with what he spelled out as a key ambition — creating an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. It means we might be getting somewhere after decades of protracted debate over whether the nation should amend the constitution to give First Nations people more say over our lives. By Jessica Riga Here's an update from Matthew Doran, who has been travelling with the Labor Leader throughout the election campaign. A quick coffee on a Sunday morning down at your local cafe is a ritual for many Australians. Even Prime Ministers. Although, they come with a far bigger posse around them. Anthony Albanese has woken up as Prime Minister-elect, after a stunning election night for the Labor party. Mr Albanese conceded he could've used a bit more sleep - but apparently Jimmy Barnes was calling him at 3:30am to congratulate him. One can only imagine how that conversation went down. With partner Jodie and dog Toto in tow, to say Albanese was mobbed at the cafe at the Marrickville Library may be underselling it. He was joined by Sally Sitou, who successfully took the seat of Reid for Labor - the new MP warmly welcomed by the crowd. Albanese signed a corflute for a young fan. ""Keep the faith"", he wrote. That won't be too hard an ask, given the euphoria in the seat of Grayndler this morning. By Jessica Riga By Jessica Riga It's the day after the election and the results are still rolling in from across the country. If you've been off enjoying a Sunday session or the sunshine, here are the answers to five quick questions to catch you up. By Jessica Riga You can tune in here.  By Jessica Riga A lot of you are asking about the seat of Ryan in Queensland. Here's an explanation from the Australian Electoral Commission: This seat had its TCP count reset. When that happens you only have the first preference count to rely on for a while. Patience. Let's see what happens as it moves forward. By Jessica Riga The way Australians regard the two-party system has changed — for both sides of the aisle. Here's Casey Briggs with some of the factors that contributed to Saturday's election result. By Jessica Riga The federal election result has shown a tectonic shift in voting, with a handful of Greens swept into the lower house and Senate, as well as some high-profile Liberal MPs losing to ""teal"" independents. Parliament is shaping to look very different with so many members on the crossbenches. So, what's driven voters towards the Greens and progressive independents? At 27, Tom Jordan has always put Labor first, but not this year. ""I've voted for the Greens first, Labor second,"" the Queenslander said. ""As a unionist and a socialist, I've always voted sort of Labor on principle. So this is the first time that I didn't feel like I could do that with a good conscience, really."" He said the major issues for him were housing and healthcare, which he thinks both the ALP and Coalition have neglected. The Griffith voter said he also used his ballot as a protest against inaction by the major parties, helping to give Greens candidate Max Chandler-Mather the edge over ALP incumbent Terri Butler, who has conceded defeat. ""I think it's the only way to really push the major parties further to the left or further to doing something about climate change,"" Mr Jordan said. By Jessica Riga Labor MP Kristina Keneally, who was parachuted into the safe seat of Fowler, has conceded to Independent Dai Le. By Jessica Riga Lots of you are asking about Ryan in Queensland. In the last little while, our election results page is showing Liberal MP Julian Simmonds leading by 131 votes. UPDATE: Here's what the AEC has said on Twitter: This seat had its TCP count reset. When that happens you only have the first preference count to rely on for a while. Patience. Let's see what happens as it moves forward. By Jessica Riga A wave of protest has washed over our federal election. The people are speaking, yet political leaders hear only what they want, writes Stan Grant. By Jessica Riga And would she put her hand up if she wasn't in the Senate? ""Today is a day for me to focus on my colleagues who no longer have seats in parliament, for me to focus on the West Australian team,"" Michaelia Cash says. Reporter: Surely the Liberal Party cannot lurch further to the right under Peter Dutton given what has just happened. Michaelia Cash: Again, this is something we need to look at as a party. But as a party you need to remain true to yourself. You need to remain true to your principles. I think we ran a good campaign. I think we have been a good government. By Jessica Riga The WA Senator has rejected the idea that Scott Morrison's comment about West Australians being ""cave dwellers"", in relation to their hard border during the COVID-19 pandemic, had an impact on how the state voted. ""That was not what he was saying at the time. What he was saying there was a light at the end of the tunnel,"" Cash says. ""Scott Morrison was actually a great friend to Western Australia and it was evident in relation to getting us our first share of GST."" ""In relation to the way we managed COVID, we were able to do it differently in Western Australia. We were able to close the border and keep everybody else out and in doing that, we lived a life that really across Australia no-one else lived."" By Jessica Riga Michaelia Cash doesn't answer the question directly and says we're currently seeing a ""structural change"" in how Australians are voting. ""It is a very good question and obviously after any election, bearing in mind that there are still postal votes being counted and there are still some seats to be decided, but the overall result across Australia is clear. ""This is something that we really do need to have a look at and I likened it last night on the panel that I was on to a structural change that really is happening in politics and that structural change, you really did see last night. Those inner city seats, here it's an Curtin, you see them in New South Wales, centred in Brisbane, Victoria, they are very much, they are not going Labor, they are going ""teal"". And then you have those outer seats that are traditionally Labor Party held but they are now aspirational voters. While they may not have become Liberal seats last night, in so many of them, the voters changing so I think what you are now seeing is a true structural change in way politics works in Australia."" By Jessica Riga ""Curtin was always going to be very, very tight,"" Michaelia Cash says. ""As we saw across Australia, this was a coordinated group of people who came together, they have called themselves independents, they are not necessarily independent, they are a coordinated group of people who have come together and have campaigned incredibly effectively across Australia. ""They have been very, very well funded and certainly given that they were only running in Liberal seats against sitting Liberal members, what we have seen is the Liberal Party vote has transferred in many cases to those independents. ""Curtin is still a very tight race and obviously the postals are still being counted, but again, you had a teal independent running against a Liberal, the Liberal Party vote has clearly been reduced and on that basis, Curtin at the moment is incredibly tight.""

62,The shock election result in Queensland that was hiding in plain sight,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes A teal volcano has erupted in Sydney and Melbourne. The surge of support for independents at the centre of Australia's two largest cities has been sudden, jolting and devastating to the conception of what is Liberal heartland. In Brisbane, a third force has also made a dramatic arrival. The Greens have taken the LNP stronghold of Ryan in the leafy inner west, with their candidate bearing striking similarities to the professional women who ran as independents against moderate Liberals in the southern capitals. Elizabeth Watson-Brown is an architect who ran her own firm for 21 years and is an adjunct professor at the University of Queensland. Greens candidates are also leading in the seats of Brisbane and Griffith over the LNP and ALP incumbents, respectively. That such a traditionally conservative state, which has never sent one Green to the lower house, could in one swoop send three, is a remarkable step change. This, however, was no explosion of support. Rather, it's been a slowly creeping tide that's risen from the inside of the city out; first with the election of Jonathan Sri to the inner-city ward of The Gabba to Brisbane City Council in 2016, Michael Berkman to state parliament in 2017, and Amy McMahon's crowning victory of defeating then-deputy premier Jackie Trad in the 2020 state election. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog But even so, this federal high-water mark still raises two questions: Why now? And why did those voters not choose Labor? Jim Chalmers, soon-to-be treasurer in the Albanese government, lamented on the ABC election broadcast that the party would have liked to have picked up more climate-conscious voters in those key contests. Perhaps it was too much for dyed-in-the-wool Liberals to switch to their bitterest rivals. Also, look at the topography of the seats in question. They all hug a Brisbane River which flooded so spectacularly and ruinously just three months ago. Many might have seen a demonstration of climate change. Labor has some soul-searching to do over the result in Queensland. It held six seats coming into the election and will come out of it at best with seven, and at worst with five. At the end of counting on election night it had won 27.8 per cent of first-preference votes in Queensland, the second lowest in the country and only marginally in front of Tasmania at 27.6 per cent. It will not hold a seat any further north than Blair, whose uppermost boundary is south of Noosa. At the start of the campaign, there were hopes of taking the coal seat of Flynn and at the end there was talk of Leichhardt in the Far North. It did not come close. Queensland is not just the most decentralised state, it is perhaps the most starkly contrasting in political terms. Conservative politicians such as Pauline Hanson and Clive Palmer have taken huge bites out of the right flank of the LNP as Brisbane has become just as progressive as inner Sydney and Melbourne. Now the Labor Party led by Anthony Albanese may have to cobble together support from other urban left-of-centre politicians. It will take more to convince regional Queenslanders than the usual lip service from leaders on elections nights when they vow to ""govern for all Australians"". The divide between left and right, at least in Queensland, seems to be growing. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. This election also, arguably, has lessons for the government of Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. If Brisbane voters are demanding the federal government do more about climate change then they may turn their eyes to the state government's targets. Scott Morrison said he had Australia on track to cut emissions by 30 to 35 per cent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels (although he declined to revise the official target of 26 to 28 per cent). Queensland's current 2030 target is a 30 per cent reduction, set back in 2017.

63,Who are the Greens and what do they stand for?,politics,"  The Greens Party has been around for 30 years, but it's only in recent elections they've started to make a real claim on the crossbench seats. This election, it is possible they could pick up four seats, up from just one in 2019. Here's what you should know about the party that shook up this election. In a win that was never really in question, Greens leader Adam Bandt won his seat of Melbourne. He has held the seat for more than a decade, and took the reins of the party after Richard DiNatale stepped down in 2020. On Saturday night, it was three neighbouring electorates in Brisbane that caught the attention of the nation. The seat of Brisbane is currently swinging from Liberal Trevor Evans towards Stephen Bates, who joined the Greens in 2019. Mr Bates drew attention to himself when he took the unorthodox strategy of taking out a Greens advertisement on gay dating app Grindr. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Mr Bates was born in the UK before moving to his mum's home state of Queensland. He says an incident while working in hospitality in the US, in which he stumbled upon a coworker in tears over having to choose between paying for insulin or rent, fostered his belief in the Greens' values. The electorate of Griffith is close to shifting from Labor's Terri Butler to Greens' candidate Max Chandler-Mather, who also contested the election in 2019. Mr Chandler-Mather grew up in Brisbane's inner-city southside, where he currently lives. He says he strongly backs policies that roll back the privatisation of services like electricity. And in Ryan, Elizabeth Watson-Brown defeated Liberal MP Julian Simmonds. Ms Watson-Brown comes from an architecture background, which she says focused on sustainable design. She says she is particularly passionate about Greens' policies on affordable housing and greening urban spaces. Most know the Greens for their, well, green policies. Here's where they stand on more of the key issues this election. The Greens are best known for their emphasis on environmental policy. The party believes the world is in a climate crisis and Australia should work towards achieving a net-zero economy by 2030, two decades sooner than Labor or Coalition policies. In order to do so, the Greens believe Australia should completely transition out of fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas and into renewable energy within the next eight years. The Greens acknowledge Australia relies heavily on fossil fuel exports to support the economy, and says it envisions kicking off a renewable export industry to replace it. The Greens stand for free education, from early childhood through to tertiary degrees. They also stand for abolishing student debt and reinvesting in the TAFE system. Key in the lead-up to the election was the cost of childcare, and the Greens support free childcare access seven days a week. One of the poster policies for the Greens this election was to include dental in Medicare subsidies. Greens leader Adam Bandt claims major credit for the introduction of childhood dental into Medicare in 2010. The party also has a strong viewpoint on mental health support. It has a policy of increasing the mental health help Australians can claim under Medicare by scrapping the limit of sessions that can be claimed. It also pledges to increase funding for the NDIS. A key housing policy the Greens spruik is to build one million new homes across Australia to decrease the pressure on the housing market. For renters, it pledges to put a cap on rent increases and put money into renter advocacy groups. The Greens say its policies on health care, childcare, rent and housing, as well as an increase to income support payments, will ease the cost-of-living burden. The party also pledges to amend labour laws to increase the power of workers, legislate against insecure work and increase wages. The Greens stand for a Treaty with Australia's Indigenous populations. Without going into specifics, the party's policy platform also describes an opposition to ""racist policies"" and ""over-policing"" of Indigenous communities. By this point, you may be thinking the policies outlined above are sounding expensive. The Greens plan to fund their policies by greatly increasing the tax rate of billionaires and big corporations. More recently, the party says it will also force companies who received JobKeeper payments while making profits during the pandemic to return their payments.

64,This win for Albanese is the most transformative election result you can imagine,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes There may have been lots of swirling currents but the results of the federal election overwhelmingly showed that 2022 was, finally, the climate election. But it was also an election that profoundly changed the political geography and demography of Australia. And an election that rejected smarty-pants political tactics and messaging, and a call for our political leaders to take the job of government seriously. It wasn't just that the independent candidates running on climate change made spectacular gains. There was also a swing to the Greens — and at least one more seat in parliament for them, if not more. Even in the so-called ""coal"" seats like Hunter and Flynn, there was not a huge swing, as had been predicted, towards the Coalition because of fear of loss of coal jobs but in fact towards Labor. It is the end of the Morrison government in an election which — while it might not have resulted in a landslide for the opposition — has seen the conservative party decimated and shattered. It has seen Treasurer Josh Frydenberg unseated from the seat of the Liberal founder Sir Robert Menzies, and a rout in the wealthiest electorates of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. Scott Morrison's close ally, Special Minister of State Ben Morton, also lost his seat of Tangney in Perth after suffering a swing of almost 12 per cent against him. Formerly safe Coalition seats are now marginal seats and there have been inroads made in places Labor has never gone before. There was a swing of more than 6 per cent against Scott Morrison in his own seat and seats that the Coalition targeted — like Blair in Queensland and Lingiari — also stubbornly resisted the PM's visits and overtures and swung further to Labor. The demographics of the seats the decimated Liberal Party now represents are very different groups of people to the ones it represented a decade ago. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The balance of power of the Coalition will also change. The Nationals have held all their seats but the Liberals have lost so many. The Coalition will be a very, very small opposition grouping, while the crossbench is likely to be around twice as large as it was in the last parliament. The downfall of the government — and the destruction of so much of what has been the old Liberal Party — and the story of the independents also make the story of the night — that we have a new Labor government — seem almost a postscript when of course it is the most important story for the future. It seemed to remain a possibility that Labor might be able to form a government in its own right on Saturday night — but whether it can or not, the fact it is set for majority or minority government after having won on just 30 per cent of the primary vote says much about the way Australian politics has profoundly changed at this election. One of the most important things to note about the nature of the new Labor government is that it will be an Albanese Labor government — it was Albanese, as leader of the house, who more than any other person made the last Labor minority government work. He is a superb negotiator and coalition builder: skills that will be crucial whatever the final numbers. And that sets the culture for his government. His Leader of the House, Tony Burke, is an equally wily negotiator. There are multiple options for Labor if it wishes to negotiate on particular issues and, significantly, a path through roadblocks that have held Australia back for a decade on climate change. A proper integrity commission looms, which could help re-establish some sense of probity in government and trust from voters. And an Indigenous Voice to Parliament may also finally make progress. It's the most transformative election you can imagine, both in the country and in the way we govern ourselves. Laura Tingle is 7.30's chief political correspondent.

65,Missed out on election night? Here's five quick questions to catch you up,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes G'day Australia. The country looks very different today after the results of the federal election. If you went to bed early, or didn't bother tuning in, here are the answers to five quick questions to catch you up. Labor won the 2022 federal election. But it is still not clear if Labor can form a majority or minority government. Labor has won 72 seats but needs 76 to govern without relying on the Greens or independents for confidence and supply - voting for the government’s budget legislation. The LNP lost 26 seats, including several high-profile MPs. The Greens are on track to win up to four seats. The independents have won 12 seats. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Labor leader Anthony Albanese will be the next prime minister of Australia. He is expected to be sworn in on Monday morning. This is to allow him to attend the Quad meeting in Tokyo with Senator Penny Wong on Tuesday. Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles will be acting prime minister while Mr Albanese is in Japan. The son of a single mother, born into a life in public housing, Anthony Albanese has achieved his life-long wish of becoming Prime Minister. Let's start with the seats that were taken by the independents. And the Greens victory that no-one saw coming. Greens candidate Max Chandler-Mather won the seat of Griffith, south of Brisbane, from Labor's Terri Butler. Several well-funded independents ran against established Liberals on a promise of climate action and government integrity. Here's how the night has turned out for them. Now for the seats that were lost to Labor. Liberal-turned-United Australia leader Craig Kelly lost his seat of Hughes in NSW, winning less votes than the Liberal, Labor and independent candidates. As of Sunday, there are still a few key seats in play. The only good news for the Liberal party might be in the NSW seat of Gilmore where Andrew Constance, a former state MP, has achieved a swing against sitting Labor MP Fiona Phillips. The seat of Brisbane, held by Liberal Trevor Evans, might fall to Greens candidate Stephen Bates. Greens candidate Steph Hodgins-May is less likely to edge out Labor's Josh Burns in Macnamara in Victoria. Labor candidates are tightly contesting the seats of Deakin, Bennelong, Menzies and Moore. Scott Morrison resigned as leader of the Liberal Party on Saturday night. He will hand over the leadership at the next partyroom meeting. Mr Morrison said he would remain in parliament as the member for his NSW seat of Cook, which he retained despite a swing to Labor candidate Simon Earle. The next Liberal leader is expected to be Peter Dutton, who is the stand-out candidate among the party's remaining MPs.

66,Here are the policies Labor campaigned on to win the election,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Labor will form the next parliament of Australia after winning the 2022 federal election. Led by Anthony Albanese, Labor have made pledges to deliver on several issues. Here is where they stand on the major ones. Labor's aged care policy, launched in Anthony Albanese's budget reply speech, focuses on five main areas. It promised to have a registered nurse on site at all times of the day. It would require staff to spend at least three hours and 35 minutes with each resident — in line with the aged care royal commission's recommendation. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Labor did not specify how many minutes each resident would have with a registered nurse per day but said each resident would have ""more time with a registered nurse"". It said it would deliver more staff to the sector and says Labor supports the push for an increase to workers' wages and will fully fund any increase. Labor says it will create a National Anti-Corruption Commission by the end of the year. They said it would cover alleged corruption by politicians and by public servants. Labor's model would have public hearings for everyone — including politicians — unless there was a good reason not to. The commission would also have the power to start its own investigations and not wait for a matter to be referred to it. It would also be able to investigate things that happened in the past. Labor promised more generous subsidies pretty much across the board — including locking in the government's changes for second and additional children. It would also raise the maximum subsidy rate to cap it at 90 per cent for the first child in care. Labor's long-term goal is to provide a universal, 90 per cent subsidy to all families. The family income threshold would be lifted from $354,305 to $530,000 and there would also be no annual cap. It would cost $5.4 billion over four years. Labor has committed to net zero emissions by 2050 and a 2030 target of 43 per cent. Its plan includes investing in green metal production — metals produced using renewable energy — making electric cars cheaper, upgrading the electricity grid to allow it to handle more renewable energy and installing community batteries and solar banks around the country. Labor is pretty much in lock-step with the Coalition on Defence spending. Anthony Albanese has said a Labor government will not let Defence spending fall below the Coalition's target of 2 per cent of GDP, but did not put a figure on how much they would spend on the ADF if it wins the election. Labor also promised an independent ""Defence Posture Review"" into Australia's military resources and strategy. Labor promised to create 20,000 new university places with a focus on areas where there are currently skills shortages. It would also offer more enrolments for students from regional and remote areas, First Nations students and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Labor's pledged to cover the cost of 465,000 TAFE spots over the next four years, which would include 45,000 new places. It'd spend $50 million upgrading IT systems, workshops and labs nationally as well. On apprenticeships, as part of Labor's plan it would pay for 10,000 new apprenticeships for people training in renewables or other clean-energy jobs. Labor is promising to introduce tax breaks for electric cars which would save people about $2,000 on a $50,000 vehicle. The policy would cost $200 million over three years and would work by exempting some electric vehicles (EVs) below the luxury-car tax threshold of $79,659 from import tariffs and fringe benefits tax. If businesses provided the same car to an employee through a work scheme the company could save up to $9,000 a year. The discount would begin from July this year and be reviewed in three years' time to reassess the take-up down the track. Labor plans to effectively scrap the Coalition's agriculture visa and instead set up a new agriculture stream within the existing Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme. The party said it will pay the up-front travel costs of Pacific workers travelling to Australia. Labor plans to ban farmers from exporting live sheep. Labor has promised to set aside $500 million from its National Reconstruction Fund to help the agriculture sector diversify and enter new markets. Labor also promised to return 450 gigalitres of water from the Murray Darling Basin to the environment, leaving less for farming and other industries. Labor has pledged to deliver funding to strengthen Australia's biosecurity system but has not said how much it plans to spend. They pledged to spend $7.5 million over four years on 20 extra biosecurity dogs and trainers to guard against disease. Labor went slightly further than the Coalition, promising to lower the cost of medicines by $12.50 to a maximum cost of $30. It promised to fund 50 ""urgent care clinics"" which it says will take the pressure off hospital emergency departments. The centres will cost $135 million over four years and will be based at GP surgeries and centres. They'll be open seven days a week from 8am to 10pm. It has also promised to match the Coalition's continuous glucose monitoring device and Seniors Health Card expansion promises. Labor's main housing policy was a new ""shared-equity"" scheme, that would see it essentially buying 30 or 40 per cent of a property with the owner. That percentage of the property could then be bought off the government by the home owner over time. Labor committed to creating a regional housing scheme with 10,000 places a year. It also suggested the price caps on houses were too low and committed to reviewing them immediately if elected. Labor also promised to create a $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, with the returns on investment being used to build 30,000 new social and affordable houses, some of which will be allocated to frontline workers and women fleeing domestic violence. It said would match the Coalition's proposal to lower the age at which people can put money from selling their house into super to incentivise people downsizing. Labor looks set to proceed with most Coalition infrastructure projects that are underway. But it plans to save $750 million by abolishing the Coalition's new Regionalisation Fund and cutting funding from the invitation-only Community Development Grants Program. There are few publicly available details about the Regionalisation Fund and the guidelines are not due to be released until July. Labor's election costings list $367.2 million in new spending for ""Infrastructure Projects"" but its pledges far exceed that. For example, Labor promised to put $500 million in its first budget for high-speed rail on the east coast and spend $2.2 billion on the Victorian government's suburban rail loop project. Labor has promised to review and reform the scheme to ensure plans are not ""arbitrarily cut"". It also wants to lift the staffing cap at the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), which oversees the scheme, review the use of external lawyers and consultants, streamline the process for initial plans, improve service delivery in regional Australia and work with people with disability on any future changes to the scheme. Labor matched both the Coalition's policies on freeze deeming rates for pensioners and other payments for two years as well as expanding the eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card by raising the income threshold. Labor supports boat turn-backs and offshore processing centres. But Labor opposes the use of temporary protection visas, because, it argues it keeps refugees in a state of limbo. The party did not comment on whether it would lift the number of humanitarian visas offered a year, but has previously supported offering more place to refugees from Afghanistan, Ukraine and Syria. Labor announced last year it would support the final stage of the tax cuts if it wins the election, meaning regardless of who wins, billions of dollars will flow to wealthy Australians. Labor said it would not introduce any new taxes except for multinationals, but did promising to close loopholes for big international corporations which it says would create almost $2 billion in revenue over four years. Labor committed to the $4.5 billion upgrade plan already underway. It has also promised to spend a further $2.4 billion expanding full-fibre NBN access to an additional 1.5 million premises by 2025. Labor's election costings document says it will decide how to pay for this pledge in consultation with the NBNCo. Labor promised $480 million for a fixed-wireless upgrade to help regional customers. Labor also promised $656 million for regional telecommunications initiatives, including money to provide multi-carrier mobile coverage on roads with coverage black spots.

""I also want to acknowledge and thank Jenny Morrison and their two daughters for their contribution and sacrifice as well.

My fellow Australians, I think they've got the name by now. I think they've got that. ""I know at the beginning of the campaign they said people didn't know me but I reckon they've got it. ""During this campaign, I have put forward a positive, clear plan for a better future for our country. And I have shared the two principles that will be part of a government that I lead.

68,"Labor set to win bush seat of Lingiari, fighting off swing towards Coalition",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Labor has won the Northern Territory seat of Lingiari after fending off a concerted effort by the Country Liberals, according to ABC chief election analyst Antony Green. The traditionally safe Labor seat was held by veteran MP Warren Snowdon for the past two decades, but his decision to retire ahead of the election gave the Country Liberals the chance to seize it for the first time. However, the most recent tally room figures show Labor candidate Marion Scrymgour has a 1.2 per cent buffer over her CLP rival Damien Ryan. It equates to a lead of just over 1,000 votes, which Mr Green believes will be large enough to overcome the outstanding postal and absent votes yet to be counted. Ms Scrymgour's current margin is significantly down on Mr Snowdon's 2019 result, when he won the seat with a 5.5 per cent margin. The ABC has contacted Ms Scrymgour and Mr Ryan for comment. Ms Scrymgour, who has cultural ties in the Tiwi Islands and Central Australia, was the first Indigenous woman to be elected to the NT parliament. She later became the Deputy Chief Minister, which at the time made her the highest ranked Indigenous woman in a government in Australia's history. Until her preselection, she was the chief executive of the Northern Land Council, which represents traditional owners in the Top End. On Saturday night, Ms Scrymgour told her supporters in Alice Springs that the race was tight. ""But we are in a better position than we all thought we'd be,"" she said. In a speech to the CLP faithful in the Red Centre, Damien Ryan also acknowledged the narrow margin. ""We've given a very big fight,"" he said. Two Indigenous women on opposite sides of the political spectrum are expected to represent the Northern Territory in the Senate. Lingiari covers 99.99 per cent of the Northern Territory, including the regional hubs of Alice Springs, Katherine and parts of Palmerston, as well as dozens of remote Aboriginal communities. Mr Snowdon's 21-year grip on the seat was largely based on his strong performance in remote areas, where he attracted 76 per cent of the vote, compared with about 44 per cent in the more populated centres. Ms Scrymgour suggested remote community residents had again sided with Labor. ""When we look right across the bush, that's come home strong for us,"" she said. However, Mr Ryan said the CLP had won the count in the remote community of Gunbalanya. ""I don't think it's been done before, so that was stunning,"" he said. Ms Scrymgour, who has cultural ties in the Tiwi Islands and Central Australia, was the first Indigenous woman to be elected to the NT parliament. She later became the Deputy Chief Minister, which at the time made her the highest ranked Indigenous woman in government in Australia's history. Until her preselection, she was the chief executive of the Northern Land Council, which represents traditional owners in the Top End. Mr Ryan is a former mayor of Alice Springs and was the long-term president of the Local Government Association of the Northern Territory. He previously ran for the CLP in the 2020 NT election, but fell just short of victory in the seat of Araluen. The battle for Lingiari saw multiple visits from high-ranking members of both parties, including Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog A range of political issues emerged in the electorate during the campaign, with crime a dominant theme in the main population centres, while housing, health and transport were the focus in remote areas.

69,"Labor, Anthony Albanese make history with 2022 federal election victory",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes With a one-in-100 year pandemic and devastating natural disasters setting the backdrop, the 2022 federal election is historic for a variety of reasons. Labor has won government for the first time in almost nine years, with Anthony Albanese to become Australia's 31st prime minister — the 12th person from the Labor Party to hold that title. Albanese is also the fourth person to serve as deputy prime minister and prime minister, after John McEwen, Paul Keating, and Julia Gillard. And for the first time since 2007, the ALP has won more seats than the Coalition — they formed a minority government after 2010's line-ball election, and then lost in 2013. Since the 2013 federal election, Australian politics has gone through many changes at the top. The Liberal Party had three prime ministers over nine years in government: Tony Abbot, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison. The National Party had four different leaders, meaning Australia had four deputy prime ministers. Warren Truss held the position until February 2016, before Barnaby Joyce took over. The former deputy prime minister is declared ineligible to sit in Parliament by the High Court. Joyce lost the role over the Section 44 saga, where he became ineligible to sit in parliament because he was technically a New Zealand citizen. Michael McCormack was deputy prime minister from 2018 to 2021, before Joyce retook the role. Meanwhile, in opposition, Bill Shorten took the party to two elections before Albanese became leader following the 2019 election loss. The Greens have also had three leaders during this time: Christine Milne, Richard Di Natale and current leader Adam Bandt. During the 2013 federal election, held on September 7, the number-one song on the ARIA charts was Roar by Katy Perry. Jennifer Lawrence had earlier won the Oscar for Best Actress in Silver Linings Playbook. Barack Obama was president of the United States and David Cameron was prime minister of the United Kingdom. Boris Johnson was still the mayor of London. Pope Francis was six months into his role as the head of the Catholic Church. In Australian sport, horse trainer Gai Waterhouse was a few weeks from winning her first Melbourne Cup with stallion Fiorente. Hawthorne would soon win the first of three consecutive AFL premierships, while Gold Coast Suns captain Gary Ablett won the Brownlow medal. The Liberal and National Coalition is facing its first major rebuild since 2007, when they suffered a thumping loss to Kevin Rudd's Labor. The Coalition won just 65 seats in 2007, with prime minister John Howard losing his seat of Bennelong. In the aftermath, Brendan Nelson became leader of the Liberal Party, with Warren Truss becoming the new Nationals leader after the resignation of Mark Vaile. While Truss held the leadership of the Nationals for the best part of a decade, the Liberal Party went through a tumultuous time. Nelson's leadership lasted less than a year, when he was challenged and defeated by Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull would last little more than a year before another challenge saw Tony Abbott take the reins. Abbott held the Liberal leadership from 2010 to 2015, guiding the Coalition to two elections and becoming prime minister in 2013, before Turnbull and later Scott Morrison would take over.

70,Morrison couldn't deliver a second miracle to part the teal sea,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Australian politics has experienced a seismic and profound shift. Scott Morrison's prime ministership is over on the back of a female independent climate revolt. It's the women, stupid. The Liberal Party has been smashed by a sea of teal women. Liberal Senator Simon Birmingham told the ABC that gender was ""clearly a factor"" in the election result. Former Liberal minister Julie Bishop said independents appealed to people who felt that the moderates within the Liberal Party were not being heard in a government that was led by ""Scott Morrison and Barnaby Joyce"". The Coalition's own tracking polls said Morrison was unpopular with women. In fact, it was lethal. In the chase for Labor's blue collar heartland, Morrison failed to connect with women. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog In the end, Morrison couldn't deliver the government a second miracle and lost his party some of its historical heartland on the back of a climate, integrity and independent insurgency. His 11th-hour epiphany that he is a bit of a ""bulldozer"", and then his promise to remain a bulldozer but switch gears just wasn't enough to convince Australians he deserved another three years, or that he was capable of sufficient personality and policy change on key issues like climate change. A generation of Liberal politicians have been lost and the recriminations will be wide and deep. After six weeks of campaigning, and three years of trouble-plagued governing, voters have sent one giant message to the major parties: do not take them for granted. This election is the shock the major parties must learn from or their power will continue to diminish. Labor was able to successfully turn this election into a referendum on Morrison's character and three-year legacy but not yet enough to win a clear majority — that is the reality the party must grapple with. Anthony Albanese is the architect of this Labor strategy and has weathered criticism for being too timid over his term as Opposition Leader. Yet, his strategy of making the government the issue and paint it as tired and out of ideas has had some impact — he will become Australia's next prime minister. It was just three years ago that Morrison became the Coalition's biggest asset, winning the so-called unwinnable election and cutting through to pull off an unlikely win. Three years later, after holidaying in Hawaii during the nation's biggest existential bushfire crisis, failing to read the room to race to obtain vaccines or enough RATs, as well as being depicted as a man consistently ""missing"" in action and unprepared to take responsibility, voters have decided to switch camps. They have done that despite expressing a broad lack of enthusiasm for Labor — the primary vote tells the story there — but the baseball bats have been out for the Liberals where it matters most. The Coalition entered this election from behind but with one central goal — to paint Albanese as too risky, too economically illiterate, and therefore unelectable. They failed, despite making some inroads on the back of Albanese's own-goals. Albanese's focus on cost of living and wages has been a success, as has the negative zeroing-in on the public's anger at Morrison. This election is the first time since 2007 that Australians have been able to deliver a verdict on the full term of a prime minister and they have not wasted the opportunity, although the next parliament will have the biggest crossbench in decades. The ""teal wave"" has swamped the Liberals, and Morrison's chase for working-class suburban seats in Labor heartland wasn't enough to counter it. Now Labor inherits the cost-of-living crisis they focused on to push this government out of office. They face an inflation conundrum, and interest rates set to rise as workers continue to languish. The recriminations inside the Coalition will begin as the moderates seek to flex their dwindling muscle to make the case that the Prime Minister's strategy hurt them in their heartland.

71,"Frydenberg faces loss in Kooyong, as independent Monique Ryan pulls ahead",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Josh Frydenberg faces federal election loss in Kooyong, as 'teal' independent Monique Ryan pulls ahead Deputy Liberal leader and outgoing Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says it will be ""difficult"" but not impossible to hold onto his inner-Melbourne seat of Kooyong, where independent Monique Ryan appears likely to claim victory. Mr Frydenberg, who has been tipped as a natural successor to outgoing Prime Minister Scott Morrison, has faced strong competition from Dr Ryan, one of the so-called ""teal"" independents. On Saturday night, Dr Ryan was ahead in Kooyong, and the ABC election computer projected Mr Frydenberg would lose. Addressing his supporters, Mr Frydenberg acknowledged the task ahead of him. ""While it's mathematically possible that we win in Kooyong, it's definitely difficult,"" he said. ""They say in politics that politicians are the volunteers and our families are the conscripts, and a truer word couldn't have been said. ""Because the fact is, I have been supported every single day of this job by the most remarkable partner in life, in my wife Amie."" He told the crowd his prep-aged son had told him earlier that day: ""A girl at school says her mum is more important than you."" ""Amie replied, 'Blake, all mums are important!',"" Mr Frydenberg said. ""Amie has been the most extraordinary mum, and maybe after tonight I get a bit more time to try and be the most extraordinary dad."" In traditional Liberal heartland in Melbourne's leafy inner-east, Kooyong takes in suburbs such as Kew, Hawthorn, Balwyn and Camberwell. The seat has been held by the conservative side of politics since its creation at Federation, boasting former prime minister Robert Menzies and former Liberal leader Andrew Peacock as previous local members. Mr Frydenberg has comfortably held the seat since 2010. Dr Ryan has been the first challenger seen as having a real chance to oust the Liberal Party. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Mr Frydenberg is the Liberal Party's most senior Victorian. As the treasurer, he has played a key role in developing the federal government's support programs as Australia navigated rolling COVID-19 lockdowns over the past two years. Dr Ryan is a neurologist who most recently headed a department at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. Her campaign has been funded by donations from thousands of grassroots supporters and the Climate 200 group created by businessman Simon Holmes a Court. Dr Ryan has been running on a platform of climate action and greater integrity in federal politics and on Saturday night told her supporters ""Kooyong, our climate has changed"". Dr Ryan, who said she was not making a victory speech, thanked hundreds of supporters who assisted her campaign. ""We started because we wanted action on climate change … our government wasn't listening to us, so, we've changed the government,"" she said. ""And that is the power of the people."" Dr Ryan has declined to say which party she would endorse in the event of a hung parliament, but has previously said she would work with whoever had the strongest policies on climate and electorate. The contest has been highly visible, with billboards, posters and corflutes plastered around the electorate and large volunteer bases handing out flyers during the campaign. The debate at times turned personal, with a stoush emerging earlier this month after Mr Frydenberg shared an anecdote about Dr Ryan's mother-in-law at his campaign launch. Tensions also flared on election day, with the Liberal Party accusing Dr Ryan's campaign team of publishing posters that did not include all the necessary authorisation information.

72,Who is Anthony Albanese?,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The son of a single mother, born into a life in public housing, Anthony Albanese has achieved a long-held ambition of becoming Prime Minister. He replaces Liberal Scott Morrison and becomes the 31st person to hold the nation's top job. A career politician, Mr Albanese arrived in Canberra as John Howard rose to power in 1996. He'd studied economics at university but always seemed destined for a career in politics. ""I came out [of the womb] with three great faiths – the Labor party, the Catholic Church and the South Sydney Rabbitohs,"" Mr Albanese said during the election. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Best known as ""Albo"", the Labor leader has spent the bulk of his political career at the frontline of ALP politics – though most have been spent in opposition. Mr Albanese's 26 years in politics have included just six in government, during which he held the infrastructure portfolio. But his shift into the prime minister's office won't be completely new for Mr Albanese, who briefly served as the acting PM in 2013, having become Kevin Rudd's deputy when he returned to power. The 59-year-old has a son and is divorced. He was joined on the campaign trail by his partner Jodie Haydon, who he met in 2019, the same year he became Labor leader. Mr Albanese first attempted to lead Labor in 2013 but lost to Bill Shorten, who served two terms. As leader, he deliberately kept a low profile and insisted he would be ""kicking with the wind"" as the election loomed. Some in Labor feared he was a creature of opposition and might not have what it takes to lead Labor from the political wilderness to government. Mr Albanese underwent a major transformation after a car crash early in 2021. He lost weight, updated his wardrobe and insisted he was ""hungry"" to become PM. As the pandemic dragged on, Mr Albanese capitalised on issues with the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the availability of RATs to drive up his personal approval ratings and the political stocks of Labor. He overcome a day one gaffe on the unemployment rate and used surging living costs and falls in real wages to argue the case for a change in government. Mr Albanese takes over as Prime Minister at a time of soaring inflation, low unemployment and a budget with $1 trillion in debt. He is a member of the left faction and represents the inner-Sydney seat of Grayndler.

73,"Labor's Luke Gosling set to win Top End seat of Solomon, locking in historic third term",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Labor MP Luke Gosling is projected to retain the Northern Territory electorate of Solomon, becoming the first politician to win the Darwin-based seat three times in a row. The former commando is forecast to get about 59 per cent of the two-candidate preferred count, a significant increase on his margin in the 2019 election. Country Liberals candidate Tina MacFarlane is projected to secure about 41 per cent of the vote. ""Solomon has been safely retained by Labor,"" ABC election analyst Antony Green said. Mr Gosling told a cheering crowd of supporters at the Nightcliff Social Club that ""we are the most incredible place in the nation and we will go from strength to strength, hopefully with federal Labor"". ""It's early days, everyone says there is a lot of counting to be done but I'm so proud to be part of Albo's team, I'm so proud of our local Territory team."" The electorate includes half of the NT's population but just 0.01 per cent of its land mass, including Darwin and parts of Palmerston. Mr Gosling was first elected in 2016 when he defeated the then CLP incumbent Natasha Griggs on a 7.4 per cent margin. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Mr Gosling was re-elected in 2019 on a margin of just 3.1 per cent, making Solomon the 12th tightest result in the country. The prospect of Solomon returning to the Country Liberals in 2022 made it the focus of multiple campaign visits from the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader, as well as other senior members of both major parties over the past six weeks. If the projection is confirmed, it will be the third time Ms MacFarlane has run an unsuccessful campaign for the Country Liberals, after previous attempts in the NT's other seat of Lingiari in 2013 and 2016. Ms MacFarlane said she was yet to concede defeat. ""There’s a lot of votes to still come in. I am hopeful we might be able to get there. But we have to wait and see what happens,"" she said. ""I’m not devastated or falling apart, it's how it is, it’s politics, it’s reality. “The people of Solomon voted, and whatever they decided, I well and truly respect it."" Ms MacFarlane said the results so far reflected the national trend away from the Coalition, as well as the splintering of the conservative vote in Solomon by the Liberal Democrats. The NT's new Chief Minister Natasha Fyles, who took over from Michael Gunner, described Mr Gosling as the ""history-making Member for Solomon"". ""It's been a big fortnight in the Territory but no better way than to cap it off with this evening's result,"" she said. Labor Senator Malarndirri McCarthy said she was feeling cautiously optimistic about the result in the vast electorate. ""I have much faith that we are well and truly going to hold on to Lingiari,"" she said in Darwin. Mr Green said it was still too early to project the outcome in Lingiari because of the sharp contrast between results in remote polling booths, which traditionally favour Labor, and regional hubs like Alice Springs, which usually lean towards the CLP. Lingiari was previously held by veteran Labor MP Warren Snowdon on a margin of 5.5 per cent. Mr Snowdon was the local member in Lingiari for the past two decades until his retirement this year. Former Alice Springs deputy mayor, Jacinta Price, looks set to enter the Senate for the Country Liberal Party. She will join Labor's Malarndirri McCarthy, who is projected to retain her seat in federal parliament's upper house.

74,'Teal' independent Zoe Daniel claims victory over Liberal Tim Wilson in Melbourne seat of Goldstein,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes ""Teal"" independent Zoe Daniel has claimed victory in the once-safe Liberal stronghold of Goldstein, declaring the result demonstrates that ""community can make a difference"". With more than a third of the vote counted, the ABC projected Mr Wilson only had around 40 per cent of the vote and would not be able to win. Shortly afterwards, Ms Daniel claimed victory over the two-term MP at her campaign headquarters. ""What we have achieved here is extraordinary,"" the former ABC journalist told supporters on Saturday night. She paid tribute to feminist activist Vida Goldstein, after whom the inner-Melbourne electorate was named. ""She ran as an independent several times because she was so independent that she couldn't bring herself to run for either of the major parties,"" Ms Daniel said. ""Vida was not elected. This seat is in her name and today I take her rightful place."" Ms Daniel also thanked Cathy McGowan, the so-called ""godmother"" of the independents movement, who has stayed politically active through a network supporting independent candidates. Ms Daniel dedicated her win to her former ABC colleague and trailblazing journalist Caroline Jones, who passed away this week aged 84. ""Caroline was a great mentor to me, she was a special woman from the ABC, a journalist who lifted other women up, including me, and today I'd like to dedicate this victory to Caroline Jones,"" Ms Daniel said. She said she planned to ""inject some sensible decision making"" and empathy, honesty and sincerity into federal politics. ""This moment is a testament to the strength of our democracy,"" she said. ""I think we have some tests ahead and there's a lot of stuff to fix. But what this says is that community can make a difference."" Goldstein takes in beachside suburbs including Brighton, Sandringham and Beaumaris, and Highett, Hampton and Bentleigh further inland. It has been held by the Liberal Party since its inception in 1984, with Mr Wilson representing the seat since 2016. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Ms Daniel is one of the so-called ""teal"" candidates who amassed a grassroots support base and funding from the Climate 200 group. She has campaigned on a platform including climate action, a federal integrity commission and truth in political advertising. She has described herself as a swinging voter, confirming she voted Labor last election and for Mr Wilson three years before that. Mr Wilson has accused ""outsiders"" of coming in to try and change the electorate. Mr Wilson was a policy director at the free-market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs and Australia's Human Rights Commissioner before being pre-selected for Goldstein. He was Assistant Minister to the Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction from October 2021. Mr Wilson was a vocal proponent for the yes vote in the marriage equality plebiscite and proposed to his now-husband in the House of Representatives. Before the count progressed, Mr Wilson told the ABC he had faced a well-resourced ""unholy alliance"" of forces that had joined to oust him from office. ""Every election is tough in an electorate but what we've seen is an unholy alliance come together,"" he said. ""GetUp!, Extinction Rebellion, Labor Party, The Greens, all abandoning their traditional camps to back behind a journalist and frankly, the ABC's given them a dream run as well."" The battle for Goldstein has been controversial since before the campaign officially began, with a battle over corflutes making its way to court in a case Ms Daniel's team ultimately won.

75,'Planet Greensland': Greens win in Ryan shakes up Queensland's electoral map,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The Greens have won the blue-ribbon Liberal seat of Ryan on the back of a massive swing to the party in inner-Brisbane, which has put them in a strong position to claim two more. Greens candidate Elizabeth Watson-Brown has defeated one-term Liberal MP Julian Simmonds in the seat of Ryan in Brisbane's western suburbs. The seat has been won by the Coalition at every general election since 1972. Mr Simmonds's primary vote slipped below 40 per cent and the Greens will win the seat on preferences after securing a swing of more than 11 per cent. ""We are now on planet Greensland and we are taking it forward,"" Ms Watson-Brown told the party faithful in Brisbane. The Greens' Max Chandler-Mather is ahead in Griffith and Stephen Bates is also in front in the seat of Brisbane. Mr Chandler-Mather said the Greens' result in Brisbane was a ""beacon of hope"" for Australians ""that you do not have to settle for the political status quo"". ""I think we had a massive swing here because we spent 14 months knocking on over 90,000 doors, running community campaigns about everything from flight noise, helping clean up after the floods, we took a philosophy we needed to embed in our communities and in people's lives,"" he said. Voters in each of these seats were badly affected by flooding in Brisbane in February and March. With almost 33 per cent of ballots counted, the Greens were also likely to secure another senator from Queensland. It remains unclear if Labor can form a majority government, the ALP is on track to finish ahead of the Coalition and likely to reach a minority government at a minimum. Despite the Greens potentially claiming up to three seats in Queensland, the state remains an LNP stronghold. The LNP won 23 seats out of 30 in the state in 2019, and while there has been a swing towards Labor in most seats, it was not enough for the party under Anthony Albanese to make up any ground. Ms Watson-Brown will become the country's second Greens MP after Adam Bandt won the seat of Melbourne in 2010. Mr Bandt, now the Greens leader, told the ABC the party had been targeting Brisbane's inner-city electorates ahead of the election. ""In Griffith, we've knocked on every door and had over 30,000 conversations with voters in that seat and that has been our strategy across those inner-city Brisbane seats,"" he told the ABC. ""I've spent time with my colleagues in Queensland and New South Wales to take a comprehensive approach that said we need to get out of coal and gas but do it in a way that supports workers and communities … that is important for people not just in those areas but also to those in the inner city as well, who are seeing we are making the transition, but doing it fairly. ""Those key elements, we have been campaigning strongly on those for three years within the Parliament and outside the Parliament and we are seeing the results of that."" Mr Bandt suggested recent extreme weather in the state played a role in the result. ""We've just had three years of droughts and then fires and then floods and then floods again and people can see that this is happening,"" he said. ""I think increasingly what we're seeing is that that cuts across all voting persuasions, it cuts across all demographics — people know it's happening."" Addressing his supporters on Saturday night, Mr Bandt congratulated Labor leader Anthony Albanese on his election victory, and said he wanted to work with the party. He said the Greens had work to do ""to ensure that we come to an understanding that means we can deliver stable, effective and progressive government in this country with a new prime minister"". Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Shadow Treasurer Jim Chalmers, the MP for Rankin in Logan, south of Brisbane, said it was a sign the Labor party perhaps needed to re-evaluate its climate change policies. ""That is something that we'll have to engage with,"" he told the ABC. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. ""Clearly that aspect of it is disappointing to us because we do have an ambitious, credible climate change policy which is all about cleaner and cheaper energy. ""We built a broad coalition for that policy and we would have liked to have picked up more climate-conscious voters in the city, so we'll have to work out why that hasn't been the case."" Defence Minister Peter Dutton secured re-election in the seat of Dickson, north of Brisbane, but acknowledged the Liberal Party had ""suffered a terrible day"". ""There are colleagues around the country, good people, who have potentially lost their seats,"" he said. ""There are still thousands and thousands of postal votes and pre-poll votes to count, so there's some hope in some of those seats."" The Member for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch, looks set to retain the Far North Queensland seat and enter his ninth term in government, despite Labor targeting the seat as a winnable one. The LNP have so far retained two Senate seats in Queensland, with both James McGrath and Matt Canavan re-elected.

While it remains unclear if Labor can form a majority, the ALP is on track to finish ahead of the Coalition and more likely to reach a minority government, the ABC has projected. This win means Mr Albanese will replace Scott Morrison as Prime Minister, making him the 31st person to hold the nation's top job. The son of a single parent who grew up in public housing, Mr Albanese has reached the pinnacle of his career after 26 years in the parliament. ""It is an incredible honour,"" Mr Albanese told reporters after leaving his house to head to speak at a party event. Introduced by Labor Senate Leader Penny Wong, Mr Albanese took to the stage and claimed victory. ""I say to my fellow Australians, thank you for this extraordinary honour,"" he said. ""Tonight the Australian people have voted for change. ""I am humbled by this victory and I'm honoured to be given the opportunity to serve as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia."" The Labor leader will be sworn in with four of his most senior frontbenchers on Monday. Mr Albanese said he hoped his story would inspire a future generation of Australian leaders. ""My mother dreamt of a better life for me and I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars,"" he said. ""I want Australia to continue to be a country that, no matter where you live, who you worship, who you love or what your last name is, that places no restrictions on your journey in life."" Mr Morrison took responsibility for the loss and said he would step down as Liberal leader. ""To my colleagues tonight who have had to deal with very difficult news and who have lost their seats tonight, I, as leader, take responsibility for the wins and the loses,""  he told the Liberal Party faithful on Saturday night. ""That is the burden and that is the responsibility of leadership."" Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Mr Morrison congratulated Mr Albanese, wished the incoming government well and said he would pave the way for the Labor leader to be sworn in as prime minister, to allow him to travel to Tokyo for a meeting with world leaders on Tuesday. ""I always believed in Australians and their judgement and I've always been prepared to accept their verdicts and tonight they have delivered their verdict,"" Mr Morrison told supporters in Sydney. Labor started the campaign, notionally, with 69 seats. As of 10:30pm, the party looks set to make history by winning government from opposition despite going backwards on its national primary vote — down 2 per cent as of 10:30pm. ""A win is a win is a win,"" Labor frontbencher Tanya Plibersek said. Crossbench and minor parties have experienced major gains, while the Coalition's primary vote is down more than 5 per cent. The Liberal Party suffered major losses to so-called ""teal"" independents, which look to take the once safe seats of Mackellar, Goldstein, North Sydney, Wentworth and Kooyong, which will take the crossbench to record levels. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg looks to be one of the highest profile Liberal losers, telling supporters at 10pm that his path to re-election looked tough in the seat of Kooyong. ""So while it's mathematically possible that we win Kooyong, it's definitely difficult,"" he said. Mr Frydenberg was considered a frontrunner to lead the Coalition in opposition. Labor has also picked up Liberal seats in Reid and Robertson, in NSW, Higgins and Chisholm, in Melbourne, multiple seats in Perth and the Adelaide seat of Boothby. The Coalition has lost the seat of Ryan, in Brisbane, to the Greens. But not everything has gone Labor's way. Senator Kristina Keneally's attempt to move to the lower house appears to have failed, with the ABC projecting independent Dai Le will win the Western Sydney seat of Fowler, one of the most-diverse electorates in the country. Fellow Labor frontbencher Terri Butler is also in a battle in her Brisbane seat of Griffith. Defence Minister Peter Dutton held his seat and becomes one of the most likely contenders to be the next Liberal leader. ""We have, as a Liberal family, suffered a terrible day today,"" he said. ""There are colleagues around the country, good people, who have potentially lost their seats."" Finance Minister Simon Birmingham said his Liberals needed to take stock from the swings it was seeing against it in once-safe seats. ""It is a clear problem that we are losing seats that are heartland seats, that have defined the Liberal Party for generations,"" he said. ""And so, if we lose those seats, it is not certain that we will, but there is clearly a big movement against us and there is clearly a big message in it, and we need to heed that message.""

77,The 'teal bath' of independents heading to parliament,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Election night is shaping as a resounding victory for a group of independents who have challenged both parties to do more on climate change and accountability. The so-called ""teal independents"", named after the colours of their campaign materials, are candidates contesting in typically safe Liberal seats on a platform of greater climate action and implementing a federal integrity commission. These candidates were backed by a well-funded campaigning machine called Climate 200, which raised about $12 million from more than 11,000 donors. And while most of these independents are challenging established Liberal politicians, Labor is also taking note of the rise of so many independents. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Liberal MPs Tim Wilson, Trent Zimmerman, Jason Falinski and Dave Sharma are projected to lose their seats to teal challengers, with another Liberal likely to fall in WA. The biggest scalp of the night looks to be Josh Frydenberg, who concedes he may have given his last speech as Treasurer. Former Liberal Party apparatchik Tony Barry is calling the night not a bloodbath but a ""teal bath"". With the close of vote counting at midnight on the east coast, here are the results so far for some of the most closely-watched independent candidates contesting in Liberal heartland. Sydney doctor Sophie Scamps was the first win among the teal independents tonight. Dr Scamps was challenging Liberal incumbent Jason Falinski for the NSW seat of Mackellar. With 70 per cent of the vote counted at midnight, Dr Scamps is projected to win. Dr Scamps was previously practising as a GP in the seat before announcing her candidacy. The ABC has projected Dr Scamps will win the seat from the Liberals, and speaking to Channel Nine the candidate claimed victory. ""This is about genuinely trying to represent our community and take our voice and values to Canberra. We're super excited. This is a win for democracy,"" Dr Scamps said. Sitting Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman has conceded his loss to independent candidate Kylea Tink in the seat of North Sydney. The ABC has also projected a win for Ms Tink, who was the chief executive of the McGrath Foundation. The seat has been held by the Liberal Party since 1996, after it was briefly held by an independent. Finance Minister Simon Birmingham said the loss was a ""devastating blow"" for the Coalition. Allegra Spender looks likely to claim the NSW seat of Wentworth from Liberal MP Dave Sharma, who has previously faced tough contests against independents for the seat. Ms Spender is a businesswoman who was the managing director for fashion labels Carla Zampatti and Bianca Spender. She leads with half the vote counted at midnight, and the ABC projects she will succeed against Mr Sharma. The seat of Wentworth was once represented by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, and fell to an independent when he quit parliament. It was won back by Liberal MP Dave Sharma at the last election. If Monique Ryan wins in her seat of Kooyong, it will be one of the biggest stories of the night. Dr Ryan is facing off against Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, not only one of the most senior members of the government, but also tipped as a future leader of the Liberal Party. Dr Ryan has spent her career in medicine and public health, and says she's ""definitely not a politician"", but was driven to run over frustration at government inaction on climate change. With half the vote counted at midnight, Dr Ryan was leading in the two party-preferred race. ABC election analyst Antony Green held off making a call on the hotly contested seat, but shortly after midnight gave the win to Dr Ryan. Mr Frydenberg spoke to party faithful to reassure them the fight was not over. ""There's still thousands of postal votes to count,"" he said. ""While it's mathematically possible that we win in Kooyong, it's definitely difficult."" Mr Frydenberg conceded it could be his ""last press conference as Treasurer"". Dr Ryan said she had not prepared a victory speech but appeared triumphant as she spoke to supporters. ""Our government was not listening to us, so, we have changed the government... and that is the power of the people,"" she said. ""We started with a very, very uneven playing field. We're evening it up"" The head of Climate 200, Simon Holmes à Court, who himself has been campaigning heavily in Kooyong, said the teal movement had seen massive success. ""[Volunteers] have knocked on every knock-able door in the electorate,"" Mr Holmes a Court said. ""The communities have seen through the fake moderate [Liberals]. These MPs have lost, or ex-MPs I guess,  who have lost their seats have been seen through as fake moderates in electorates that want moderate politicians."" Kooyong has been held by the Liberal Party and its conservative predecessors for its entire existence, most famously being the seat of party founder Robert Menzies. Zali Steggall has kept her seat of Warringah and appears to have increased her lead. Ms Steggall drew massive attention when she claimed the seat of Warringah on Sydney's North Shore from former prime minister Tony Abbott. Her 2019 victory, partly funded by the then-nascent Climate 200 group, has been an inspiration for the group to drive a larger campaign this election. Ms Steggall was widely predicted to win against Liberal contender Katherine Deves, who brought significant attention to the contest over her controversial views on transgender people. Finance Minister Simon Birmingham said the Liberal Party made a mistake running Ms Deves as their candidate, telling the ABC ""we've paid a price in Warringah"". Zoe Daniel was a foreign correspondent for the ABC who has made implementing a national integrity commission one of her highest priorities. The ABC has projected Ms Daniel will win Goldstein. The bayside seat of Goldstein in Melbourne has been held by the Liberal party since it was established in 1984, and by Mr Wilson since 2016. ""What we have achieved here is extraordinary,"" Ms Daniel. ""This moment is a testament to the strength of our democracy. Community can make a difference."" Voting closed two hours later in Western Australia than in the east coast states but independent candidate Kate Chaney is in the lead in Curtin with more than 60 per cent of the vote counted at midnight. Ms Chaney was most recently an executive for Anglicare in Western Australia and is the niece of form WA senator Fred Chaney. Curtin has been a Liberal-held seat since its inception, and was previously represented by former foreign minister Julie Bishop, and most recently by Celia Hammond.

78,ALP set to gain Boothby for first time in more than 70 years,politics,"  Labor looks set to pick up the Adelaide seat of Boothby for the first time in more than 70 years, according to ABC election analyst Antony Green. Boothby is South Australia's most marginal seat and was the focus of a predominantly three-cornered contest — between Labor, the Liberals and teal independent Jo Dyer — to replace outgoing Liberal MP Nicolle Flint. With more than half the vote counted, the ABC's election computer is predicting Labor's Louise Miller-Frost has defeated Liberal candidate Rachel Swift. Earlier, Green told ABC viewers that Boothby was among the ""seats which are changing"". Tonight, Ms Miller-Frost all but claimed victory, taking to the stage flanked by her three triplet sons and husband. ""This is our win – hopefully this is our win. This is our positive result, shall we say,"" she told supporters. ""There are still some preferences to be counted, but I’m feeling really very hopeful."" Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Ms Miller-Frost told supporters the likely result reflected the views of the electorate on a range of issues. ""We went out there to talk to them about what they wanted,"" she said. ""They want action on climate change, they want a federal ICAC … they want action on aged care."" Going into the election, Boothby was South Australia's most knife-edge seat and was retained by the Liberals at the 2019 election on a margin of 1.4 per cent. While its boundaries have changed over the decades, Boothby has been in Liberal hands since 1949. Dr Swift earlier acknowledged the tense nature of the race. ""It is a close contest, we always knew it would be a close contest in Boothby,"" she said. ""I think it's going to be a long night. We still have a lot of pre-polls to count, a lot of postal votes to count, but the pre-poll so far has been really positive. ""I'll just continue to do what I've done for the past 12 months which is chat to the community and watch numbers come in."" On Twitter, independent challenger Jo Dyer acknowledged her own defeat, but said she had been proud of ""what we added to the campaign"". ""In theatre, there are no small parts — it's all about the impact you have when on stage,"" Ms Dyer tweeted. ""We had a big impact in the Boothby race."" The recent South Australian state election represented an electoral trouncing for the Liberal Party, and most of SA's 10 federal lower house seats have registered swings away from the Coalition. While the seat of Sturt, in Adelaide's eastern suburbs, is not usually regarded as marginal, incumbent Liberal James Stevens has had a fight on his hands to retain it. The current count has Mr Stevens marginally ahead of Labor's Sonja Baram. Mr Stevens, who won the seat in 2019 on a 6.9 per cent margin after Christopher Pyne retired, said the party now had some serious challenges ahead as it confronted the prospect of a ""rebuild"". ""Tonight's a tough night for the Liberal Party and we had another tough night two months ago,"" he said. ""I hope that I'm re-elected here in Sturt. I believe that will be the case, but it is a tight contest and it's too early to call the result. ""We've got some challenges, there's no-doubt about it. There'll be another time to talk about those challenges and what we need to do to rebuild our great movement here in South Australia to be one that leads this state and leads this country forward."" Former SA deputy premier Vickie Chapman — who is at the Robin Hood Hotel, where supporters of Mr Stevens have gathered — was measured in her assessment, acknowledging Mr Stevens had a fight on his hands. ""It's obviously a difficult time for James but as you know, we've just experienced the state election again where there are multiple parties and significant independents,"" Ms Chapman said. ""We have a situation where it can be several weeks before we know the actual answer to who is going to be the local member."" Ms Chapman said the result would likely come down to pre-polls and postal votes, and said the number of candidates had had an impact on the outcome so far. ""Generally pre-polls will support a swing to the Liberal Party but we'll see,"" she said. ""We see a huge drop in the primary vote, splintering off across eleven candidates. I can't think of a time when we've had eleven candidates, it's the highest in all of South Australia. ""That just simply splinters the primary vote and naturally there's been this drift and how those cards fall as they drift off is really the key to this."" The regional seat of Grey has also recorded a swing against the Liberals, but it does not appear to be anywhere near enough to threaten long-time MP Rowan Ramsey. Mr Ramsey's main challenger was independent candidate Liz Habermann, but he is currently ahead on a significant margin and the ABC is projecting he will retain the seat. With more than a quarter of the vote counted, Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie looks to have secured the seat of Mayo, seeing off Liberal challenger Allison Bluck. On the current count, Ms Sharkie has also picked up a significant swing towards her.

79,Labor on track to win marginal seats of Chisholm and Higgins from Liberal Party,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Labor is on track to wrest two seats from the Liberal Party in Melbourne, including what would be an historic victory in the former Liberal stronghold of Higgins. The ALP is ahead in the ultra-marginal electorate of Chisholm — which covers Mount Waverley, Burwood and Box Hill — where the sitting member is first-term Liberal Gladys Liu. With more than 22 per cent of the vote counted, the ABC's election computer has predicted a win for Labor's candidate Carina Garland. Ms Garland is an academic and former assistant secretary at the Victorian Trades Hall Council. Chisholm has changed hands between the Liberal and Labor parties in recent decades, often with a small majority. At the last federal election, both major parties nominated candidates with Chinese backgrounds. It was a first in Australian political history and reflected the fact that about one in five people in the Chisholm electorate have Chinese ancestry. Chisholm was the state's most marginal seat in the 2019 vote, when it was won by the Liberal Party's Gladys Liu on a margin of 0.5 per cent. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog There were 12 candidates on the ballot this year, so preference flows from the minor candidates could play a crucial role as more votes are counted. In Higgins, Labor's Michelle Ananda-Rajah, an infectious diseases doctor who rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic, is on track to defeat first-term Liberal MP Katie Allen. Dr Allen, a paediatrician, held the electorate on a margin of 2.6 per cent after the 2019 poll. The seat in Melbourne's inner south-east has been held by the Liberal Party since its creation in 1949 and has been held by two former primer ministers — John Gorton and Harold Holt. Traditionally a safe Liberal seat, Higgins — like many inner-city electorates in Melbourne — has experienced a rise in support for the Greens in recent years. Higgins was today the site of controversy because of green-coloured signs urging people to ""put Labor last"" erected across the electorate. Labor took the matter to the Federal Court, which issued an injunction ordering the signs be taken down. The Liberal Party is also set to lose the seats of Kooyong and Goldstein, which have both been represented by the conservative side of politics since their creation. Liberal MP Michael Sukkar was also facing a fierce contest in Deakin, which remained too close to call on Saturday night. By 9pm, Labor was on track to retain several other key seats in Victoria. Labor's Libby Coker looked set to retain the seat of Corangamite, which takes in outer Geelong and the northern Surf Coast. Ms Coker was facing a challenge from Liberal Stephanie Asher, who left the role as Geelong mayor to contest the seat. Corangamite has become a knife-edge seat in recent years as demographic shifts and boundary redistributions have changed the way the electorate votes. Peta Murphy was also projected to hold the seat of Dunkley, which covers the south-east bayside suburb of Frankston and its surrounds. Dunkley has changed hands between the Liberal and Labor parties over the years as its boundaries have changed, with barrister and former crown prosecutor Sharn Coombes contesting the seat for the Liberal Party this year. Labor was also on track to pick up the new electorate of Hawke, covering satellite communities in Melbourne's west and north-west, taking in areas such as Sunbury, Melton and Bacchus Marsh. After its creation, it was notionally held by Labor on a margin of 10.2 per cent, and the party recorded two-party majorities in 25 of the 26 polling places included in Hawke's boundaries at the 2019 election. Sam Rae, a former state secretary of the Victorian Labor Party who headed Daniel Andrews's election campaign in 2018, was running for Labor and is projected to win the seat. RMIT professor Enamul Haque was the Liberal candidate. Minor parties — such as Clive Palmer's United Australia Party — were expected to pick up votes along the peri-urban fringe. The Nationals' grip on power in Victoria's north was also shaken, with a tight race emerging between new Nationals candidate Sam Birrell and independent Rob Priestly in the electorate of Nicholls. While Mr Birrell is on track to win the seat for his party, the mood at his Shepparton campaign gathering was bittersweet. His independent rival hacked a significant chunk off the Nationals' historical 20 per cent margin, threatening the Coalition's comfortable reign in the region. And while Mr Birrell’s party has retained the seat, it will not be under a Coalition government. Mr Birrell admitted the seat’s stark swing against the Nationals showed his party ""needs to listen to the electorate very carefully"". ""Having said that, I think all governments needed to make very difficult decisions during the pandemic,"" he said. ""The electorate is very annoyed and upset and independents offer a bet each way in that you can have a political representative who's not associated with the really difficult decisions either the Coalition or Labor might have to make. ""I don't think it's a good trend."" Meanwhile in a speech to supporters, Mr Priestly said while he may not have claimed victory, the seat was no longer a Coalition stronghold. “We've taken Nicholls from being one of the safest seats in the country, never discussed, never part of the national agenda, to being at the centre of the political discussion,"" he said. ""It may not have been this one, but it will be the next one or the one after for sure. ""Nicholls is going to be completely contestable every time."" To the east, independent MP Helen Haines was on track to retain seat of Indi, which would be the fourth consecutive time the seat has been won by an independent candidate.

80,Scott Morrison's Coalition unable to form majority government,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Scott Morrison's Coalition government will be unable to form a majority government, the ABC's election computer has projected. The Liberal Party is under a lot of pressure in once-safe heartland seats, losing to so-called ""teal"" independents. It remains unclear if Labor will be able to form a majority government or if Australia will have a hung parliament. With more than a quarter of the vote counted, Labor looks to have won the seats of Chisholm, in Melbourne, and Reid, in NSW. The ABC is also projecting former athlete turned GP Sophie Scamps becomes the first so-called ""teal"" independent looking likely to win. Independents also looks set to win North Sydney and Goldstein. ABC chief election analyst Antony Green has projected the Coalition appears unable to reach 76 seats, unless postal votes are radically different from the count as of 8:40pm. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Incumbent Liberal MP Jason Falinski’s primary vote has fallen to around 40 per cent, meaning he will not be able to win a third term in parliament. Finance Minister Simon Birmingham said his Liberals needed to take stock from the swings it was seeing against it in once-safe seats. ""It is a clear problem that we are losing seats that are heartland seats, that have defined the Liberal Party for generations,"" he said. ""And so, if we lose those seats, it is not certain that we will, but there is clearly a big movement against us and there is clearly a big message in it, and we need to heed that message.""

81,"'Clear rejection of the Liberal Party': Massive swing to Labor in WA as Hasluck, Swan, Pearce, Tangney fall",politics,"  Western Australia has turned its back on the Liberal party with a massive swing of around 10 per cent, and the loss of four seats to Labor. The collapse in the Liberal vote is the biggest swing in the country away from the Liberals and a massive result for a state where the conservative side of politics has traditionally performed strongly at a federal level. With a national swing away from the Liberals of around 2.5 per cent, Scott Morrison's Coalition has lost government and Anthony Albanese will become the Prime Minister. However, it is unclear whether Labor will have enough seats to govern in its own right or will have to form a minority government. ""This is this story. If Labor gets in to majority government, it's because of Western Australia,"" ABC election analyst Antony Green said. ""Western Australia has behaved completely differently from the rest of the country. ""It's a clear and very strong rejection of the Liberal Party and a big swing to the Labor Party."" Labor has picked up the previously safe Liberal seat of Pearce, which used to be held by former Attorney-General Christian Porter and Swan, which was held by the retiring Liberal Steve Irons. It has also gained Hasluck, held by indigenous Affairs Minister Ken Wyatt, while the very safe Liberal seat of Moore, held by Ian Goodenough, is also in doubt. And in another Liberal shock, Liberal Ben Morton has lost Tangney, which he previously held with a margin of almost 10 per cent, with Labor challenger Sam Lim set to be sworn in. Before today, 10 of the 15 federal electorates in WA were held by the Liberal Party, and the remaining five were Labor. With four of these confirmed to have fallen to Labor, several others are too close to call, and even previously safe Liberal seats such as Canning, held by Andrew Hastie, have become marginal. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The most marginal of Labor's seats previously was Cowan in Perth's south-east, held by Labor's Ann Aly by a slim 0.9 per cent, but she appears to have substantially increased her majority. Former Wanneroo mayor Tracey Roberts is the new ALP member for Pearce, in Perth's north east, while engineer Zaneta Mascarenhas is the ALP's member for the inner Perth seat of Swan. Ms Mascarenhas said she felt there was a strong sense of change and people wanting more from the Federal Government. ""We've seen poor leadership from Scott Morrison, out of touch, [he] doesn't want to take responsibility."" ""What we saw with Mark McGowan was how he decisively led during the pandemic — something we didn't see from Scott Morrison."" Meanwhile, Tania Lawrence has defeated Mr Wyatt in Hasluck, on Perth's eastern outskirts. One of the most interesting battles has taken place in the affluent western suburbs seat of Curtin, where so-called ""teal"" independent Kate Chaney is leading Liberal Celia Hammond. Antony Green says Ms Chaney is ""well-positioned"" to win the blue-ribbon seat which was once held by former Defence Minister Julie Bishop. Ms Hammond, the former vice-chancellor of Notre Dame University, previously enjoyed a margin of almost 14 per cent. Ms Chaney, a former corporate lawyer and strategy director at charity Anglicare, has been campaigning for more action on climate change, political accountability and women's issues. The significance of the west to the national vote was not lost on the leaders of the two major parties. How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' Labor launched its campaign in Perth for the first time since 1940 and Prime Minister Scott Morrison dashed across to WA for the last day of his political campaign in a final bid to win over the voters of Swan, Pearce, Hasluck and Cowan.

82,Liberals' Bridget Archer likely to retain 'ejector seat' Bass in key Tasmanian result,politics,"  Liberal MP Bridget Archer looks set to become the first politician to win re-election in the seat of Bass in 20 years, as the electorate of Lyons remains far too close to call. Ms Archer held the northern Tasmanian electorate, known as the nation's ""ejector seat"", by a razor-thin 0.4 per cent margin before this weekend's election. The ABC projects she will buck that label and defeat Labor candidate Ross Hart, with the former George Town mayor on track to extend her margin. Ms Archer said she was feeling ""overwhelmed, quite emotional and really proud"" following the campaign. ""I've been really privileged to represent the people of Bass through a really difficult time and to support them through that, and I just feel so humbled that they have offered me the opportunity to continue to do that,"" she said. ""My commitment to the people of Bass is that I will continue to act in their best interests, that I'll continue to be that genuine and authentic person. ""I'm a bit too real sometimes, I have brought all of my vulnerability to this role. It's been very challenging for me and at times I've wondered if I'm up to the task, but I hope that from doing that that it gives comfort and courage to other people and they can see themselves reflected."" Ms Archer said it was too early to speculate on what had cost the Coalition the election but said she would be fighting ""tooth and nail"" to hold the Labor Party accountable as it forms either majority or minority government. Ms Archer is one of four Tasmanian MPs set to retain their seats, with Franklin, Clark and Braddon all called by the ABC's Antony Green. But the fifth seat — the sprawling electorate of Lyons — remains too close to call, with Labor MP Brian Mitchell locked in a tense battle with Liberal councillor Susie Bower. The ABC's projection has Brian Mitchell marginally ahead of the Meander Valley councillor with 70 per cent of the vote counted. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Liberal Gavin Pearce has retained Braddon, increasing his margin in the north-west Tasmanian seat which was previously considered marginal. The beef farmer and former Wynyard RSL president first won the seat in 2019, dethroning Labor's Justine Keay and this time around defeated Labor candidate Chris Lynch. Mr Pearce believed voters rewarded him for his hard work on their behalf, saying since being first elected, unemployment had dropped and more jobs had been created. ""Finally we've turned the corner and you know I've worked damn hard to make sure that's happened, and they recognise hard work, certainly when they see it here in Braddon,"" Mr Pearce said. Mr Pearce said he would call on his experience in the defence force when dealing with the new Labor government. ""Certainly when it comes to the rough and tumble of negotiating, you know you get a couple of hundred soldiers under your command and I tell you what, they try you out from time to time as well."" ""I'll be a loud voice for the region, they know that."" Independent Andrew Wilkie has been re-elected in the Hobart-based seat of Clark on a comfortable margin. Mr Wilkie has held the seat, formerly called Denison, since 2010. He stayed clear of his election night supporters' party due to being in COVID isolation. Mr Wilkie, who joined his celebrations via video link after testing positive to COVID-19, said he was delighted to secure a fifth term. ""Elections are a wonderful celebration of democracy and to have secured a fifth term is tremendous validation that my consistent calls for greater fairness and action on many key issues have resonated in the greater Hobart community,"" he said. ""I will continue to work hard to honour the trust the community has placed in me and will never take it for granted."" The southern Tasmanian seat of Franklin has been called for Labor's Julie Collins. It is Labor's 11th straight victory in the seat, which has been held by Ms Collins since 2007. In the Senate, where 43.6 per cent of the vote has been counted, the ABC projects that Jacqui Lambie Network candidate Tammy Tyrell is on a path to be elected. She would be the only new Tasmanian addition to the Senate under those projections, at the expense of long-serving Liberal senator Eric Abetz who was relegated to the third spot on the Liberal ticket. Ms Tyrell has received 56 per cent of a quota, with the Liberal Party on track for 2.15 quotas, only enough to re-elect Jonathon Duniam and Wendy Askew. The Greens' Peter Whish-Wilson and the ALP's Anne Urquhart have also been re-elected. Labor's Helen Polley (the party has 1.88 quotas) is considered likely to be re-elected. Ms Tyrell said she would be watching the remainder of the count closely. ""It would be like Christmas day, it would be like that … 16th birthday where you get the present and you go like 'Yes! Mum has come through' but being able to speak for Tasmanian voices in their tone and giving their message would be amazing,"" she said.

The ABC has received multiple copies of the texts from voters nationwide, including in the NSW electorates of Hughes, Macquarie, Greenway, Banks and Robertson, as well as the Victorian electorates of Dunkley, Corangamite and Casey. The text, which has been criticised for politicising national security, reads: ""BREAKING: Australian Border Force has intercepted an illegal boat trying to reach Australia. Keep our borders secure by voting Liberal today. https://vote.liberal.org.au"".

Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog ""As Australians go to vote today it is important that they are informed about the choice that is before them,"" a party spokesperson said. It comes after Scott Morrison this morning confirmed an unauthorised vessel from Sri Lanka had been intercepted on its way to Australia. The Prime minister told a media conference the vessel was intercepted under government policy and following normal protocols. ""In the interests of full transparency in the middle of an election campaign, the Labor Party was advised of this and a statement has been issued by the border protection authorities."" Several hours later, voters around the country started receiving text messages alerting them to the ""BREAKING"" news. Do you know more about this story?

Dr Moffitt pointed to the 2001 election and the Tampa affair as a possible precedent, when the Howard government's refusal to accept the passengers seeking asylum after being rescued by a Norwegian tanker became pivotal to the campaign. ""But that wasn't sending out mass texts on the last day,"" he said. ""This is a 2001-2004 tactic, just updated with mass communication."" Gerard Mathews, a voter in Bennelong who also received the SMS, told the ABC he thought the text message was intended to scare voters.

""I can confirm that there's been an interception of a vessel en route to Australia. That vessel has been intercepted in accordance with the policies of government and they're following those normal protocols,"" he said.

86,Premier Mark McGowan heckled over vaccine mandates as about half of West Aussies opt to vote early,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes West Australians are lining up at polling booths across the state to cast their vote, but about half of all voters made their choice about who should lead the country before today. The state has about 1.8 million eligible voters and more than half a million have cast their ballot papers at pre-poll voting centres while more than 300,000 valid postal vote applications have been received. Australia-wide, more than 50 per cent of Australians have already voted at pre-polls or via the post, setting a new record in the country, says the Australian Electoral Commission. A last-minute change to voting rules, only made yesterday, meant people who have tested positive to COVID-19 will be able to vote over the telephone this election. That includes people who have tested positive since last Friday night, however, close contacts without symptoms cannot use the telephone service, as they are able to vote in person. It's unclear how many West Australians will be eligible to vote over the telephone today, but with about 91,000 active COVID-19 cases in the state, it's likely to be around that figure. For some West Australians, today means democracy sausages and a chance to have their say on how the next three years will look for the nation. However, with the rest of the country up to two hours ahead of the West, voters in this state have the final say, which could be crucial in the outcome of this election. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. Prime Minister Scott Morrison chose to spend the last day of his political campaign in Western Australia, in a final bid to win over the previously Liberal-leaning state. But even Labor took the unusual step of holding its campaign launch in WA for the first time since 1940. Labor has sought to capitalise on the popularity of WA Premier Mark McGowan on the campaign trail, with the state leader appearing side by side with Anthony Albanese during his visit west in the final week of the campaign. But it didn't all go smoothly for Mr McGowan as he attempted to vote in the safe Labor seat of Brand, in Perth's south. The WA Premier was repeatedly heckled by a United Australia Party volunteer over vaccine mandates, while in line to cast his ballot. ""Why can I go to the football, but I can't work in my job,"" the heckler said. ""I'm one of your constituents. It's a fair question, I deserve an answer."" Mr McGowan told the man he would not talk to him before the Premier's security intervened. ""The good thing about the mandates is we got to the highest vaccination rates in the world, the best health and economic outcomes in the world and I think sometimes that is not well understood,"" the Premier said. ""Mr Palmer's team don't like it, but they're really just a bunch of oddballs."" After Mr McGowan had cast his vote with his son Samuel — who had voted for the first time — he told the media he had appreciated the attention Western Australia had received during the election campaign. ""What you don't want to be is forgotten, and one of the good things hopefully that will come out of this is more balance in Western Australia,"" he said. He admitted it had been a hard-fought election campaign but said he was confident Labor would be elected. ""I'm very confident about one thing tonight, that Craig Kelly will not be the prime minister of Australia tomorrow."" The Coalition currently holds 10 of the state's 15 Parliamentary seats, as Labor sets its sights on claiming the marginal seats of Swan, Pearce and Hasluck. In the electorate of Swan — where the Liberal party holds the seat by 3.2 pe cent — voters queued at the polls, waiting for the doors to open at 8am. Labor's Swan candidate, Zaneta Mascarenhas, arrived at the polls this morning on her cargo bike, with her two kids riding in the cart, which she said was her usual school drop-off vehicle. Ms Mascarenhas is going up against Liberal candidate Kristy McSweeney. Perth resident Ella Bracone voted at a primary school and said that coming along on election day made her feel more involved in the community. She said climate change was a major factor in voting for her Swan candidate. ""Healthcare is a big one for me … I'm a healthcare worker and climate is a huge one as well, which has definitely influenced how I voted in my local election."" Meanwhile, Liberal MP and Indigenous Affairs Minister Ken Wyatt — who holds the seat of Hasluck — has voted at Ellenbrook Primary School. On Wednesday, the AEC revealed some regional polling booths in WA may not be able to open due to staffing shortages. However, the ABC has been told all polling stations have opened as planned, including across the O'Connor electorate. Liberal MP Rick Wilson is seeking a fourth term in parliament as the member for O'Connor – an electorate spanning a massive 1.1 million square kilometres — and is campaigning in Albany on the State's south coast today. Labor candidate Shaneane Weldon began her day campaigning in Kambalda in the WA Goldfields region and is due back in Kalgoorlie-Boulder to vote at O'Connor Primary School around 11am. There are also dozens of minor party supporters out in force today. There was a minor hiccup this morning when the Goldfields Arts Centre in Kalgoorlie-Boulder was briefly evacuated due to a fire alarm. Meanwhile, in the state's north, the ALP's candidate for Durack Jeremiah Riley has just cast his vote at the Broome Civic Centre with Labor Senator Pat Dodson. Mr Riley is challenging incumbent Liberal Party MP and Morrison Cabinet Minister Melissa Price, who holds the seat by a significant 13.5 per cent margin, making it one of the safest Liberal seats in the country. Durack is also the biggest in terms of geography at 1.6 million square kilometres, spanning from just north of Perth to the tip of the Kimberley. Mr Riley is a Yamatji man from the state's Midwest and hopes a predicted swing towards the ALP across the country will see the cards fall in his favour today. ""I feel confident that we're [ALP is] going to win, whether I win that is the question,"" he said. ""Hopefully I can swing this huge margin to get us over the line. ""I really have given it my best shot."" Mr Riley said he hopes to highlight issues relating to childcare, aged care and securing an Indigenous voice to Parliament if he pulls off a miracle today.

87,Labor Party wins court battle to remove 'misleading' green signs in Melbourne electorates,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The Federal Court has ordered green signs urging voters to ""put Labor last"" to be removed from Melbourne polling stations after an election-day challenge from the Labor Party. Labor lodged the court bid this morning, after writing to the Australian Electoral Commission to say members of its campaign team witnessed people putting up signs in the knife-edge seat of Higgins. The ALP said the posters had also been put up in the electorates of nearby Goldstein, and in McEwen and Hawke on Melbourne's peri-urban fringe. Labor said the signs were ""misleading"" as they used the same colour scheme as the Greens Party but instead purported to be authorised by a Hendrick Fourey of the Business Owners and Contractors Union. The union's website says the group was formed in 2019 and ""brings together and represents small-medium business owners and contractors"". In an earlier Twitter post, the Greens called the signs ""desperate tricks"". Member for Higgins Katie Allen denied any knowledge of the signs, while the Victorian Liberal Party said it did not authorise the election materials. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog The AEC confirmed with the ABC it had received a complaint about the signs and was reviewing the matter. Its injunction orders that any officer of the AEC is authorised to now remove the signs. The commission was unable to disturb the election material until the injunction was ordered. The electorate of Higgins was held by Liberal Katie Allen on a margin of 2.6 per cent after the 2019 poll. The seat in Melbourne's inner south-east has been held by the Liberal Party since its creation in 1949 and has been held by two former prime ministers — John Gorton and Harold Holt. Traditionally a safe Liberal seat, Higgins — like many inner-city electorates in Melbourne — has experienced a rise in support for the Greens in recent years. Dr Allen is being challenged by Labor candidate Michelle Ananda-Rajah, a doctor, and Greens candidate Sonya Semmens, who works in the non-profit sector. The Liberal Party has lodged its own separate complaint to the AEC over signage in the Melbourne seat of Kooyong. The complaint states that how-to-vote cards and corflutes for independent candidate Monique Ryan are written in Chinese, but are authorised solely in English. If election material is written in another language, AEC requirements dictate that authorisation must be notified in both English and the language used. The ABC has independently sighted one of Dr Ryan's posters which did not have any Chinese-language authorisation message. The AEC told the ABC it was aware of the authorisations and understood that rectifications were being put in place to have the full, appropriate authorisation statement on the products. A spokesperson for Dr Ryan denied the allegations and said authorisation requirements on all election material had been met. ""All Chinese election campaign material used by Dr Ryan's campaign, including How to Vote cards, are properly authorised in the correct languages,"" the spokesperson said. In a copy of the letter from the Liberal Party to Dr Ryan seen by the ABC, lawyers said ""we note you have stated they are correctly authorised"". ""However, contrary to this assertion your campaign has told the AEC that you are rectifying inappropriate authorisation on these same materials,"" the letter said. ""We demand that you immediately remove from display or distribution these unauthorised signs and how-to-vote cards."" The seat of Kooyong is set to be hotly contested, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg facing down a challenge from Dr Ryan. Dr Ryan is one of 23 ""teal"" independents running under the banner of the Climate 200 group, funded by activist multimillionaire Simon Holmes à Court. The election campaign has been marked by breaches of the Commonwealth's electoral act. Signs authorised by conservative lobby group Advance Australia falsely depicted independent candidates David Pocock and Zali Steggall as members of the Greens. In 2019, a senior Victorian Liberal Party figure admitted in court that Chinese-language signs used in two Melbourne seats at the last federal election were designed to convey the appearance of official AEC material.

88,The 24 key seats that will decide the election result,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes National swings don't tell the full story of an election; individual seats hold the key to success. Polls have now closed in the eastern states and the counting has started. Keep an eye on these 24 key seats which could change hands. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Macquarie lies on Sydney's western and north-western fringe. It has traditionally been a marginal Liberal seat won only occasionally by Labor. Gained by Labor's Susan Templeman in 2016, her narrow victory in 2019 was the first time since 1983 that a Labor member had been re-elected. Her victory margi­­n was just 371 votes and Macquarie the last seat declared in 2019. As in 2019 the Liberal candidate is Sarah Richards. Bass — in the north-east corner of Tasmania centred on Launceston — has become known as the ""ejector"" seat in recent decades, with nine of the last 10 elections resulting in a change of sitting member, and eight seeing a switch in the seat's party status. In 2022 it will be Liberal MP Bridget Archer who takes her turn trying to break the string of one term Bass MPs. She will be opposed by the MP she defeated in 2019, Labor's Ross Hart. Chisholm — in the eastern Melbourne suburbs — is a perennial marginal seat, though usually Labor held in recent years. Former speaker Anna Burke's retirement in 2016 saw Chisholm become the only seat gained by the Liberal Party, a victory that saved the Turnbull government. New Liberal MP Julia Banks walked away from the party after Turnbull was replaced as leader in 2018, but Chisholm did not become the expected Labor gain. It was won by new Liberal candidate Gladys Liu. She is opposed by Labor's Carina Garland. Cowan is an inner-northern Perth seat and has been represented by Labor's Anne Aly since gaining it at the 2016 election. The new Cowan contains roughly equal numbers of voters from the old Cowan and the abolished Stirling, so Vince Connelly has almost as many claims to represent the seat as Aly. Cowan has moved against the national trend before, being one of only two seats lost by Labor in the election of the Rudd government in 2007, but there are not great expectations of a repeat performance in 2022. Once a safe Liberal seat in Victoria's western districts, successive redistributions have caused Corangamite to shed rural areas and contract towards Geelong. Labor won Corangamite for the first time in nearly eight decades in 2007 and retained it for a second term in 2010. The seat was re-gained for the Liberal Party by Sarah Henderson on the election of the Abbott government in 2013. After two terms as MP, Henderson had her margin wiped out by a redistribution ahead of the 2019 election and she was defeated by Labor's Libby Coker. Henderson has since been appointed to the Senate. The Liberal Party has a high-profile candidate for the 2022 election in former Greater Geelong Mayor Stephanie Asher. Blair is based on Ipswich to the south-west of Brisbane. It has been held by Labor's Shayne Neumann since 2007, even managing to hold on against the anti-Labor mood in 2013 and 2019. Unless Labor performs even worse than in 2019, then Neumann should be able to retain Blair. The LNP candidate is Sam Biggins. Wentworth has traditionally been a safe Liberal seat. Malcolm Turnbull took the seat's margin out beyond 15 per cent, but his departure saw Wentworth won by independent Kerryn Phelps at an October 2018 by-election. Phelps was narrowly defeated by Liberal Dave Sharma at the 2019 election, but he now defends his narrow 1.3 per cent margin against a new independent challenger — Allegra Spender, a businesswoman in her own right but also daughter and granddaughter of prominent Liberal MPs and daughter of the late fashion designer Carla Zampatti. Boothby, covering the southern suburbs of Adelaide, has been Liberal held for decades, but it has become more marginal over the last 20 years. Siting Liberal MP Nicolle Flint is retiring, leaving Boothby as the key seat to watch in South Australia. The new Liberal candidate is Dr Rachel Swift, opposed by Labor's Louise Miller-Frost. Boothby is also being contested by independent and former Adelaide Writer's Week director Jo Dyer. Gilmore was Labor's only real seat gain in 2019 but should never have been lost by the Liberal Party. The victory of Labor's Fiona Phillips in 2019 was only the second time Labor had won the South Coast seat since it was first contested in 1984. Scott Morrison's choice of former Labor Party President Warren Mundine as Liberal candidate upset local branches, causing the Nationals and the previously chosen local candidate to run as an independent, preference leakage allowing Labor to win. The new Liberal candidate is Andrew Constance, until recently member for the local state seat of Bega and the high-profile transport minister. Higgins covers a string of once strongly conservative-voting inner eastern Melbourne suburbs where demography and voting patterns are shifting. Former Liberal member Kelly O'Dwyer retired in 2019 and new candidate Dr Katie Allen saw the Liberal first preference vote drop below 50 per cent for the first time, the seat's usual double digit margin dipping to 3.7 per cent. Higgins is a seat that both Labor and the Greens think is winnable, and Allen's opponents in 2022 are Labor's Dr Michelle Ananda-Rajah and the Greens' Sonya Semmens. Long-term Hunter Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon is retiring in 2022. The Labor National Executive has chosen coal miner and Olympic shooting medallist Daniel Repacholi as the party's candidate, upsetting local party members and triggering the nomination of several independents. One Nation finished third with 20 per cent of the vote in 2019 and the party's preferences came close to defeating Fitzgibbon. The National Party's candidate is James Thomson. Despite the seat's remote location compared to the bulk of Australia's population, Solomon behaves more like an outer metropolitan electorate where cost of living and service issues dominate. First contested in 2001, Solomon was won by the Country Liberals at four of its first five contests before being gained by current Labor member Luke Gosling in 2016. He won re-election in 2019 despite a 3 per cent swing against him. His CLP opponent will be Tina MacFarlane who has twice previously been the CLP candidate for Lingiari. Braddon takes in the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania and includes the major centres of Devonport, Burnie and Queenstown. While Braddon has re-elected more sitting members than neighbouring Bass, it has still changed party at six of the last eight elections. Current Liberal member Gavin Pearce was first elected at the 2019 election and will be opposed in 2022 by Labor's Chris Lynch. For decades it was a safe Labor seat in Sydney, but on its current boundaries, Reid is essentially the abolished seat of Lowe which had long been a marginal seat won by both sides of politics. Fiona Martin is the sitting Liberal member while the Labor candidate is Sally Sitou. Swan — across the river from the Perth CBD — was traditionally a marginal seat that tended to be Labor-held until won by Liberal Steve Irons in 2007. Irons is retiring this year. The new Liberal candidate is former journalist and ministerial adviser Kristy McSweeney, opposed by Labor's Zaneta Mascarenhas. Parramatta has been held by Labor's Julie Owens since taking it from the Liberal Party in 2004. Owens is retiring this election which opens the seat to a Liberal challenge. Liberal Party results in local state seats have been strong in recent years, and the party will hope to capitalise on the loss of Owens' personal vote. The Labor Party has taken the potentially dangerous decision to appoint an outsider as its candidate, choosing former Kevin Rudd Economics Adviser Andrew Charlton despite living in Sydney's eastern suburbs. The Liberal candidate is businesswoman Maria Kovacic. Former Cumberland Mayor Steve Christou is running as an independent and recommending preferences away from Labor. Leichhardt — which extends north from Cairns — is the sort of far-flung regional seat where sitting members can entrench themselves, which is exactly what Liberal Warren Entsch has done. First elected in 1996, the only time he hasn't been elected since was in 2007 when he temporarily retired. As in 2019, his Labor opponent is Elida Faith. More than any other tourism seat in the country, Leichhardt has suffered from border closures during COVID, losing all international tourists and most interstate tourists courtesy of Queensland's closed border. Brisbane has been held by Liberal Trevor Evans since 2016, but faces a threat from two opponents in what has become a three-way contest. In 2019, Evans polled 47.8 per cent of the first preference vote to 24.5 per cent for Labor and 22.4 per cent for the Greens. Unless Evens keeps his first preference percentage in the high 40s, strong flows of preferences could deliver victory to whichever of Labor or the Greens has the higher first preference vote. The Labor candidate is Madonna Jarrett, the Greens represented in the contest by Stephen Bates. There will be more attention than usual on Lingiari with the retirement of long-serving Labor member Warren Snowdon. Snowdon's personal vote will be missed by Labor, especially in the larger population centres. The new Labor candidate is former NT Deputy Chief Minister Marion Scrymgour, opposed by former Alice Springs Mayor Damien Ryan. Lingiari covers 99.9 per cent of the Northern Territory and around a third of votes are collected by mobile polling teams visiting remote communities. That such an establishment inner Melbourne electorate can be listed as at risk highlights recent problems in the Victorian Liberal Party as well as the shifting demographics of Kooyong. It has been held by Treasurer Josh Frydenberg since 2010. Kooyong's Liberal margin is 6.4 per cent based on a two-party contest, or 5.7 per cent in the final two-candidate contest versus the Greens in 2019. The Labor Candidate is Dr Peter Lynch, the Green candidate Piers Mitchem, but the bigger threat is Independent Dr Monique Ryan. Goldstein has been held by Tim Wilson since 2016. His Independent challenger in 2022 is former ABC journalist Zoe Daniel. North Sydney has been held by Liberal Trent Zimmerman since a 2015 by-election. While North Sydney is traditionally a safe Liberal seat, it previously left the Liberal fold when won by independent Ted Mack in 1990 and 1993. Hoping to emulate Mack's success in 2022 is former charity CEO Kylea Tink. As with several other inner-Sydney Liberal seats, the ""teal"" independent challenge is forcing the Liberal Party to devote considerably more resources to North Sydney than is normal at a federal election. Fowler is in Sydney's outer south-west and is one of the city's most ethnically diverse electorates and the centre of the city's Vietnamese community. Fowler has been a safe Labor seat since it was first contested in 1984, generally held by relatively low-profile Labor MPs. Retiring MP Chris Hayes tried to engineer pre-selection for a member of his staff with a Vietnamese background, but the Labor Party decided to move former NSW premier and current Labor Senator Kristina Keneally into the seat. While there is no chance of the seat being won by the Liberal Party, Keneally's candidacy has encouraged City of Fairfield Councillor Dai Le to nominate. Le has previously run Labor a close race as first a Liberal and later an Independent in the state seat of Cabramatta. Nicholls is a very safe Coalition seat, but sitting National MP Damian Drum is retiring, opening up the seat for both Coalition parties to contest. The new National candidate is Sam Birrell opposed by Liberal Steve Brooks. At the two previous three-cornered contests in 1996 and 2016, Labor finished a distant third and Labor preferences played a role in the result. Nicholls is of interest because it is being contested by a high profile Independent, Rob Priestly. Nicholls is a seat open to a strong Independent challenge given it sits next to Independent-held Indi, and the local state seat of Shepparton is also represented by an Independent. If Priestly polls higher than one of the Coalition candidates, he could win on leakage of preferences.

89,"Sturt in play, along with Boothby, as South Australia heads to the polls for the federal election",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Labor is becoming increasingly confident of winning the marginal Liberal-held seat of Boothby in Adelaide's south and has now shifted its attention to Sturt in Adelaide's east, a political expert says. But University of Adelaide emeritus professor of politics Clem Macintyre said it would be hard for Labor's Sonja Baram to win the Liberal stronghold off sitting MP James Stevens, who holds Sturt by a 6.9 per cent margin. ""Sturt will be a very hard seat for Labor to win,"" Professor McIntyre said. ""It's a seat that Labor's been looking at and one they've been putting a lot of resources and time into. ""If Labor is winning Sturt on Saturday night, then I think we're going to be expecting a very significant Labor majority."" Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese yesterday invited cameras to film him having coffee in Norwood with Ms Baram and former prime minister Julia Gillard in Sturt. ""The fact that Anthony Albanese was in Sturt on Friday I think suggests that Labor has still got some optimism about Sturt,"" Professor MacIntyre said. ""But it's a significant margin to make up."" Mr Stevens, who took over the seat from Christopher Pyne last election when he retired, saw a 1.5 per cent swing in his favour, but he said this election was set to be a ""really tight contest"". ""I know it's really going to come down to the wire,"" he said. Ms Baram said it was great to have her party's leadership in her electorate yesterday. But when asked when she realised Sturt was in range, she said she still had not. ""It's clear that there's an interest in Sturt and it's a reflection of the change that people in Sturt are looking for,"" Ms Baram said. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog While visiting Adelaide yesterday, Mr Albanese also spoke at Cabra Dominican College, in the state's most marginal seat of Boothby, in Adelaide's south, which is held by outgoing Liberal MP Nicolle Flint by a 1.4 per cent margin. Mr Macintyre said it appeared Labor thought it would win the seat for the first time in more than 70 years. ""I think Labor is increasingly confident that they will win Boothby and so, in a sense, the Liberals have shifted their defences from Boothby, to a degree, to Sturt, and Labor has shifted its attention to Sturt with some optimism,"" he said. Boothby Labor candidate Louise Miller-Frost said there was a mood for change among voters in her electorate. ""I think people know that if we don't change the government, we won't get action on climate change, we won't get action on the aged care royal commission and we won't get a federal ICAC,"" she said. ""People are very keen. They understand that if you want change you have to vote Labor."" Despite her competition receiving a visit from the party leader the day before polling day, Liberal candidate Rachel Swift said she was not concerned. ""I don't think about the Opposition Leader,"" she said. ""All I'm focused on is the people of Boothby and listening to their priorities."" Dr Swift said she had the right experience to address her constituents' concerns, which included the cost of living, the economy, health care and job security. ""People really want someone who's got an international set of skills and experience to look after them in Boothby,"" she said. The seat of Grey, which covers a 92 per cent of South Australia, has also been a talking point this election, after independent Liz Habermann, who also ran in the March state election, put her name forward. Running for the state seat of Flinders, Ms Habermann recorded a significant swing towards her, but not quite enough to win. Given Grey covers the same area (plus much more), Mr Macintyre said the seat would garner more attention than usual. ""We'll be watching Grey at this election probably with a lot more interest than would normally be the case, simply because of the rise of the independents and the fact that Liz Habermann did as well as she did at the March state election,"" Professor Macintyre said. Liberal Rowan Ramsey has held the seat since 2007, recording a 13.3 per cent margin at the last polls.

90,Kylie caught COVID twice in eight weeks. So will reinfections slow Western Australia's pandemic recovery?,politics," Coronavirus After a relatively mild first bout of COVID-19, triple-vaccinated Perth teacher Kylie Lund was shocked to catch the virus again so quickly — and so badly — just eight weeks later. She tested positive for the second time last Friday and went downhill quickly, having to call an ambulance on Sunday night after finding it difficult to breathe and swallow. ""I have had worse hangovers than my first COVID but this [second] just floored me,"" she said. ""It's such a weird virus."" As Western Australia continued to record its highest-ever daily COVID-19 infections this week, a small but growing number of people like Ms Lund are also becoming reinfected with the virus. While the case of a healthcare worker testing positive for two different variants of COVID 20 days apart might be rare, reinfections are increasingly common. So, what are the odds of getting sick a second time? It's a scenario that has been recorded around the world but the concept of reinfection is somewhat novel in WA, where the population is still adjusting to its first wide-scale community outbreak more than two years into the pandemic. A WA Health spokesperson said they were in the early stages of tracking reinfections in WA, which it defines as an infection more than 12 weeks after a previous infection. While this is the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia definition of reinfection, it does not capture Ms Lund's experience of eight weeks between infections. ""A person can experience reinfection of COVID-19 strains, similar to how a person can be reinfected by common colds or influenza,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""Reinfection can occur twelve weeks or longer following initial infection."" The Telethon Kids Institute's Peter Richmond said that data from overseas showed that reinfections were not common, with about one in every 2,000 infections being a reinfection. ""It is relatively rare, to be honest, and is generally not associated with a particularly severe second infection,"" Professor Richmond said. But he said that because WA was experiencing such high rates of infection, the chances of being exposed to the virus were very high. ""If you think every day in WA we're now getting 17,000 [cases], then you would expect eight of those people would get reinfected in a short period of time if they're exposed to the virus,"" he said. Schools, in particular, have been particularly hurt by the COVID-19 outbreak. Ms Lund started the school year soon after receiving her booster vaccination in mid-January but caught the virus from a student in early March. She thinks her second bout of the virus came via her daughter. As a teacher, she feels bad about her absence from the classroom — this is her fourth round of COVID leave, including time off as a close contact — and its impact on her students and fellow teachers. ""When I rang my principal, I just burst into tears,"" she said Professor Richmond, who is the director of the Institute's vaccines trial group, said the Omicron variant was about 10 times as likely to be associated with reinfection compared with previous strains of the virus. Most of us know someone who has managed to dodge catching COVID-19, despite being in a household with people who are sick. What makes some of us more resistant than others? He said reinfection was more likely in unvaccinated people, while those who were both vaccinated and had a previous infection had stronger immunity. ""Vaccination alone seems to be better than infection alone in preventing a subsequent infection,"" he said. While WA has a high vaccination rate, with 80 per cent of the eligible population triple-jabbed, immunity is beginning to fade for some as this current wave of infection hits new peaks. Some older and more vulnerable community members have been receiving a fourth jab, which Professor Richmond said international research had shown could help to prevent reinfection up to two months afterwards. He is hoping to learn more through a study he is leading into the immune response to a fourth jab and whether they can predict who will be reinfected. But when asked whether we will be in a constant cycle of infection and reinfection, he said it was still difficult to tell. ""It will eventually level out but it may be, like we have with the cold virus, we don't really get rid of them. We just don't notice them so much,"" he said.

91,"Why is social media getting spammed by politicians despite an election ad blackout, and who's spending the most on it?",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Expect to have your social media feeds swamped with election adverts today as politicians try desperately to hold onto their seats and hopeful challengers lay siege. Under federal election rules, a campaign media blackout fell across all parties on Thursday, barring them from advertising on radio and television. The Australian Electoral Commission recorded 743,000 pre-poll ballots that day, the biggest pre-polling day in Australia's history. But because it is not pre-internet days and media has spread well beyond traditional outlets, the blackout no longer gives voters a reprieve. It instead diverts the campaign online and across social media. According to data from Meta (the parent company of Facebook and Instagram), ALP candidate for the Brisbane seat of Petrie, Mick Denton, has pumped more than $14,000 into Instagram and Facebook adverts this past week — the equivalent of $2,000 a day. Amount spent in past seven days on Facebook, Instagram — data accessed May 19 He was hoping to unseat the LNP's Luke Howarth, who has attempted to fight him off by spending about $6,000. The ALP incumbent in Brisbane's seat of Lilley, Anika Wells, has poured more than $64,000 into advertising on Instagram and Facebook since mid-2020. She is the biggest spender of all Queensland's major party candidates, having rolled out 680 Facebook and Instagram advertisements over the past two years. Ms Wells has spent more than $4,000 in the past seven days alone. She is trying to hold onto a seat with a margin of just 0.6 per cent — the tightest in the state. The second-highest spender was the LNP's Phillip Thompson, who is defending his Townsville seat of Herbert in north Queensland. Despite holding a comparatively safer seat with an 8.4 per cent margin, he has still spent more than $50,000 since August 2020 on about 500 Instagram and Facebook adverts, including $4,216 in the past week. The media blackout only applies to television and radio, which meant video platforms like YouTube and social media apps like Facebook, TikTok and Instagram were exempt, along with newspapers and websites. Totals since August 2020 for Facebook, Instagram — data accessed May 19 Text messages, including those transmitting multimedia, were also exempt from the blackout, a platform controversially used by Clive Palmer and his United Australia Party. Griffith University associate professor Paul Williams said social media spending gave candidates and parties big bang for their buck, with their messages better-targeted than a TV, radio or website ad. ""There's so many people that don't watch any television at all,"" he said. ""They don't buy newspapers, they don't buy magazines, and their only form of news consumption, or indeed entertainment, is from their laptop, their tablet or their phone. ""[This includes] YouTube clips, TikTok, whatever it is, where they will see these social media political ads."" Find out how political parties and candidates are seeking to influence your vote on Facebook, and help us shed a light on the hidden campaign. Achieving the same reach through major media outlets could cost candidates millions of dollars. But Dr Williams said with millions of people voting ahead of election day through pre-polling and postal votes, the blackout made even less sense. ""It's time to amend the Act, lose the blackout or capture social media in the blackout,"" he said. ""Or lose the blackout then look at [campaign] spending caps."" An 18-month inquiry into the 2019 federal election recommended the blackout should be reviewed ""with a view that the restrictions on commercial radio and television broadcasters be removed"".

92,"Remote polling teams use boats and helicopters to reach voters, but this year's challenges are unprecedented ",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes But when the Australian Electoral Commission's remote voting team on Thursday travelled to Binjari — she cast her vote anyway. ""They told us if we don't vote we get a fine — I didn't want to, it's hard to vote for someone that's not supporting us,"" she said. ""We’re left to suffer in our community, and I don't think my vote will make a difference."" Over the past couple of weeks, the AEC has been attempting to pull off one of the country's biggest logistical events in the vast outback electorate of Lingiari. It is a seat with a landmass double the size of Texas, taking in roughly 99 per cent of the Northern Territory and all the jurisdiction's remote Indigenous communities. In boats, planes, helicopters and 4WDs, remote polling teams have trekked thousands of kilometres to reach voters like Ms Raymond, living in a part of the country with the lowest voter turnout. Voter participation in remote Indigenous communities is in decline, and has been lower than the national average since First Nations people were granted the right to vote in 1962 — but this year, they've faced even more challenges. Some remote communities have had just a couple of hours to cast their ballot, while most urbanites have had access to pre-polling centres for weeks. Certified interpreters have been scarce and some smaller homelands have missed their chance to vote altogether. Northern Land Council Chair Samuel Bush-Blanasi — who recently accused the AEC of ""failing"" Aboriginal voters by not engaging more people in the bush ahead of the election — said the AEC should be spending more time in remote communities. ""This short window for voting does not take into account daily life in remote communities where people have other commitments, including work, childcare, travel as rangers and so on, as well as important cultural obligations,"" he said. The 2021 Senior Australian of the Year, Dr Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr Baumann, said she was disappointed in the ""hiccups and confusion"" that played out across the Territory, hindering Aboriginal votes. She said her community in Daly Waters had no access to interpreters when the remote polling team set up booths, and pointed to the government's failure to close the gap on issues like health and education as reasons why Aboriginal voters felt disengaged. ""The majority of people were confused and wanted someone to sit with them to explain the system,"" she said. Whoever voters decide will inherit Lingiari from retiring MP Warren Snowdon also inherits some of the nation's toughest challenges. Residents living in two homelands on the outskirts of Gapuwiyak were left with no other option than to drive hundreds of kilometers to a voting centre, after an AEC team travelling in a helicopter was stranded at a remote outstation last week. ""They didn’t have sufficient fuel … so the helicopter pilot returned to Gove, left the AEC staff on the ground and it must have got too late in the day and the weather was bad, so the helicopter wasn’t able to get back in,"" Lynne Walker, a former senior Labor politician, said. ""They had a little bit of food between them … and were provided with some sheets and sleeping space on the verandah, but apparently it was a pretty uncomfortable night. ""So of course it wasn't going to be possible for that team to get to Raymangirr and Gurrumuru the next morning. “There was no plan to send an alternative team.” Ms Walker said residents of the homelands received no communication from the AEC, and were left feeling ""disappointed and disenfranchised"". “Yindi djama [a phrase commonly used by Yolngu people] means big job and that’s certainly been the case for everyone on the ground … but for the years that I've worked on Federal and Territory campaigns around Northeast Arnhem, it's probably been one of the most disrupted remote area polling schedules that I've seen."" Rob Roy, who lives in Kalkaringi, a community 480km south-west of Katherine where the main spoken language is Gurindji Kriol, said while lots of people turned up to vote, once they had their pencil in hand, the process became a minefield. He said there was no credited translator there to help people navigate the ballot. “Most old people take their grandkids to help them,” he said. Greg Dickson, a linguist and interpreter in Ngukurr, said he was roped in to provide in-language assistance at the last minute when the remote voting team visited the community of around 500 people. Kriol interpreter services are used across Australia and often form a bridge between Indigenous communities and the wider population. Yet many people don't see the need. This year, the AEC has relied on recruiting local assistance where it can, instead of engaging the Aboriginal Interpreter Service's certified interpreters, who are trained to be impartial. In the seat of Lingiari, where around 40 per cent of voters are Aboriginal who often speak multiple languages, Mr Dickson said the void of interpreters could have resulted in scores of informal votes. ""I was flat out pretty much all day,"" he said. ""Almost everybody here in Ngukurr speaks Kriol as a first language … federal voting only happens once every three, four years … it's a weird thing that requires literacy, requires understanding of the electoral system, requires a bit of basic numeracy. ""It's something that people need assistance with.” In an official complaint leveled against the Australian Electorate Commission, Matthew Ryan and Ross Mandi allege voter suppression has been taking place in remote Indigenous communities since 2012. The Australian Electoral Commission's NT manager Geoff Bloom said that with voting teams travelling to 193 locations, ""finding interpreters across that whole spectrum was very challenging"". He conceded it was ""not a great outcome"" that an interpreter was not present at Ngukurr. ""The Remote Area Mobile Polling challenges that we've had in this election are absolutely unprecedented,"" he said. He said COVID presented immense challenges to staffing and listed the lack of charter flights as a big driver hindering the team's ability to reschedule visits. In 2017, the federal government slashed funding to the Australian Electoral Commission's Darwin office cutting 16 staff to three, and axing the Indigenous Electoral Participation Program, which was only reinstated last year. A spokesman for the AEC refuted claims the cuts have been detrimental to polling in the NT, but Charles Darwin University researcher, Michael Hartwig said it had created apathy in communities. ""Many communities don't see a representative or an AEC employee from one election to the next,"" he said. ""They've had three or four years of Territory government, in particular, not living up to its promises, getting money from the federal government and not [seeing it flow] through in housing, in health, in crime."" He said a quick visit to a community days before the election just would not cut it to increase voter participation, and that instead it would take ""days in there winning the confidence of the people, convincing them that voting is important"".

93,"Greg Butler has contested 21 elections since 1977, but this may be his last",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Greg Butler has been in the game of politics, on and off, since 1977. Over 21 campaigns, including this one, he has attempted to be elected as a representative of the Australian people. In all those years since he hasn't wavered in his pursuit of political office. But what keeps him going, this time as a candidate for the New South Wales seat of Eden-Monaro? And what change has he seen in the political landscape over the past 45 years? Born in Goomalling in Western Australia, Mr Butler moved east with his parents at six months old. He spent six years growing up in Bega in southern New South Wales and later moved to Wollongong. In 1977, his political career began when he ran for the position of Lord Mayor of Wollongong. Unsuccessful, he would in the years that followed join the Australian Democrats — an emerging party led by former Liberal politician Don Chipp. In Mr Butler's eyes, the Australian Democrats were a centrist party that amalgamated the policies of parties that existed at the time, including the Australia Party and the environmentalist group United Tasmania. It was during this early time that he made his mark on politics by joining protests, run by the Tasmanian Wilderness Society, against the damming of the Franklin River. ""They were organising people to jump over a fence and walk down a road towards the dam site,"" he said. ""The government was arresting anyone who did that, even though it's public land, so I said, 'righto, we'll all go through that experience and find out exactly what's involved with that'. ""So I went through the non-aggressiveness training that they had, jumped over the fence, walked down towards the dam site. ""I was the first person to do that not get arrested after 1,500 arrests or so. ""At the time, I was a little disappointed I didn't get arrested, but they didn't arrest anyone else after that, so it was a bit of a watershed moment."" Forty-five years of campaigning — while still working in between in various jobs, including on Canberra's light rail project — have given Mr Butler a sense of progress but also frustration. He said some things were much the same as when his political career began as they are now. ""Labor and Liberal were spending all their time throwing mud at each other,"" he said. ""And nobody was really getting on with policies. There was a gap between them, [and] we filled the gap."" An engineering major at university, he was passionate about sustainability and the environment at the time and said it was a much more marginal issue then than it is now. But on the status of certain other social issues, he is not so pleased. ""We still have three million Australians living in poverty,"" he said. And that is one of the main reasons Mr Butler has once again decided to contest an Australian election, despite the rigours of the campaign beat. ""In 45 years, that hasn't changed much,"" he said. ""There just aren't the safety nets there, there isn't the system there to lift people out of poverty and get them participating in society as they should."" The Australian Democrats describe themselves as ""the watchdog of the Senate"". Environmentalism, a voice to parliament and poverty are some of the party's central policies. Over the years the party has also drawn some notable members, including Cheryl Kernot, who was an MP representing Queensland between 1990 and 1997. As a long-time member of the Australian Democrats, Mr Butler believes minor parties are starting to gain more of a foothold than previously in Australian politics. ""They're starting to get a bit of traction to the concept that you can actually vote for the candidate of your choice,"" he said. ""At the very start, there were people saying, 'oh, you waste your vote if you vote for [the Australian] Democrats'. ""And what's happening now is that Labor and Liberal are now starting to struggle to convince people that they are the only choice."" As for whether he will run again, Mr Butler, at 69, is not certain. After all these years, he has other things he wants to do. ""My wife's been very patient and understanding and I have promised her things and this has put that on hold for a while,"" he said. ""She's got a 1956 Morris sitting in the garage I said I'd help her with. So if I get elected, I could be in trouble I think."" However, he said campaign number 21 was a significant birthday, and that it should still be celebrated in some way. ""I think they should give me the keys to Parliament House,"" he said.

94,"It's been a campaign of Rickrolls, but Rick Astley promises one thing politicians don't",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes What should I write about this week, a politics-weary broadcaster asks her son (well, it worked last time). ""Rickrolling,"" says the 10-year-old brightly. Can you believe it? A digital prank from the early 2000s, and several years before my son was even born, has become the new craze at my kid's school, with many pre-teens taking great delight in tricking each other into linking to one of the most annoying ear-worms of our times. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog ""Do you even know who Rick Astley is? How did you guys get into this?"" ""Memes, of course!"" Memes — the Uber-eats of public discourse, with on demand, right-to-your-door delivery of snack-sized take-downs, put-downs and backdowns, and the kind of thing in an election like this that can make or break a campaign. I'm tempted to describe that soccer tackle as a Rickroll, except that unlike a pre-emptively apologetic Astley, the first word out of the Prime Minister's mouth was not an apology, oddly enough. I'm also tempted to describe the repeated and smarmy attempts by some journalists at cheap gotcha moments as a kind of Rickroll: you click on a link that's supposed to take you to sober, independent reporting and find yourself in an episode of Jerry Springer. Make no mistake, if you're not across the basic detail — and yes Mr Albanese, that does include the unemployment rate — that is a problem and you will be properly marked down for it. But being screamed at to ""say the number"" or recite six points of a policy for which you have a fully-briefed minister, is at least show-boating nonsense, at worst the fulfilment of a specific agenda. These attacks might have made more sense if we'd seen balanced examples of tough questioning when the prime minister Rickrolled his way out of some questions by pivoting to completely extraneous issues — but we often didn't. I fear this is the election that permanently breaks apart any trust between the consuming public and large parts of the media, such has been the corrosion of faith between those charged with the task of accountability and those who crave it. There has been some fine, thoughtful reporting – and there has also been some absolute rubbish. We will only have ourselves to blame. But maybe the biggest Rickroll-er might have been the boffins at the Australian Electoral Commission — or, to be fair, those in power who make the rules for them. The possibility of tens of thousands of Australians being disenfranchised because their COVID infection missed the arbitrary cut-off date for phone voting was astonishing. The electoral commissioners last-minute rule change saves the AEC from viral misstep of the season. Most importantly, this has been a genuine contest. If anyone tries to tell you that ""they're all the same"" and there has been no real policy to get your teeth into this campaign, then please ignore them. As with almost every other election, the choices are wide and varied — from the major parties to the most obscure independent — with offerings that will meet you exactly where your most pressing issues are, no matter what those issues might be. And for that reason, I think this election campaign has fulfilled its policy brief: they might not be all the policies you want to see, but there are enough to make a real choice. And it's the act of choosing that matters.

95,How are the key seats in Queensland going? Follow live,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes The Sunshine State was a major factor in delivering the Morrison miracle in 2019 — a blue tide across Queensland saw the LNP win 23 seats out of 30. Labor holds just six seats in the state and not a single one outside the south-east corner. The ALP will be hoping to reverse some of its losses last time around, while the Coalition will be keen to keep its grip on as many seats as possible. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Glenn Kefford from the School of Political Science and International Studies at the University of Queensland said the electoral battleground of Queensland was crucial to the overall result. ""Queensland is always critical. It is the jewel in the crown of the Coalition and any seats that the government loses in Queensland is going to make it difficult for them to retain power,"" he said. So which seats should we be watching? Follow results from some of Queensland's key seats. You can jump ahead to an electorate here: The inner-city marginal seat of Brisbane has been billed as one of the most important in this election. Dr Kefford pointed to the inner-city triumvirate of Brisbane, Griffith and Ryan as the seats to watch. All three are held by the major parties — Brisbane by the LNP's Trevor Evans, Ryan by the LNP's Julian Simmonds, and Griffith by Labor's Terri Butler — but are facing an outsize challenge from Greens candidates. The Greens and their preferences could have a major say. ""My sense is that Labor will likely pick up Brisbane,"" Dr Kefford said. Brisbane, held by a marginal 4.9 per cent, covers the city's CBD and inner-city suburbs on the riverside and northside. Outside the south-east corner, the central Queensland seat of Flynn has attracted attention during the campaign. The LNP's retiring member Ken O'Dowd holds the seat on a safe margin of 8.7 per cent. The marginal Labor seat of Griffith has been held by Labor's Terri Butler since the 2014 by-election on a margin of 2.9  per cent. Dr Kefford said he backed Labor to retain the seat. ""I that it is likely that Butler will be returned and that despite all of the work that the Greens have been doing and a likely increase in their primary, I think Labor's primary is going to increase as well,"" he said. Labor's Shayne Neumann has held the seat, centred on Ipswich and its surrounding suburbs, since 2007. His margin was cut back to just 1.2 per cent in 2019. It's Queensland's second-most marginal seat and the Coalition has demonstrated it is hopeful its candidate, commercial real estate agent Sam Biggins, it will unseat Mr Neumann. The seat has seen Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce no less than six times during the campaign. The entry of wildcard candidate, Jack Dempsey in the very safe LNP seat of Hinkler has also made it an interesting contest. Political scientist with Griffith University Anne Tiernan was doubtful of Mr Dempsey's chances in the race. ""I'm not sure that he'll get there in Hinkler but it certainly has made it a contest with [LNP incumbent] Keith Pitt,"" Professor Tiernan said. Mr Pitt, the Minister for Resources and Water, holds the seat on a generous margin of 14.5 per cent. The sprawling marginal seat of Leichhardt stretches from Cairns up to Cape York in Far North Queensland. This federal electorate, which has been held by the LNP's Warren Entsch since 2010,  has garnered plenty of attention during the campaign, with climate change, cost of living and damage to tourism front of mind for voters. The LNP holds the seat on a 4.2 per cent margin. Professor Tiernan said the ultra-marginal seat of Lilley was no longer likely to change hands. The prediction comes after LNP candidate Vivian Lobo's campaign was disrupted by allegations he provided false information to the Australian Electoral Commission. ""They've just had candidate trouble in Lilley which is disappointing for [the LNP's] campaign and has sort of left [Labor incumbent] Anika Wells probably pretty safe in that seat I think,"" Professor Tiernan said. Labor holds the seat on a margin of 0.6 per cent. Professor Tiernan said another marginal seat to watch is the swinging seat of Longman, which includes the Sunshine Coast and Caboolture. ""The other one that everyone's had their eye on is Longman — it's really, really hard to know,"" she said. The mainly urban electorate, which sits on a margin of 3.3 per cent, has been held by the LNP's Terry Young since 2019. Professor Tiernan said preference flows from minor parties such as the United Australian Party will be decisive. ""I think Longman is one that Labor would really hope to pick up, and I think the fragmentation of the vote makes it very difficult to see which way that's going to come out and I don't think anybody knows."" The blue-ribbon seat of Ryan, stretching west of Brisbane's CBD, is ostensibly safe on a margin of 6.0 per cent — but it was one of the only LNP seats where the vote slipped in 2019. The seat is currently held by the LNP's Julian Simmonds. Dr Kefford said the electoral race in Ryan was ""a bit of a cliff hanger"". ""I think Ryan is a really difficult seat to call because I think we are going to see both Labor and the Greens primary vote increase and the LNP primary to decrease,"" Dr Kefford said. ""That is a really tough electorate to call. I think Julian Simmonds would be feeling quite nervous."" There are several high-profile candidates who are vying for a Queensland Senate seat. While there's six seats up for election, it's generally understood that only three are in play — with the LNP certain to retain two and Labor certain to retain one. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. One Nation leader and current Senator Pauline Hanson, Clive Palmer from the United Australia Party and former Queensland premier Campbell Newman for the Liberal Democrats all have high profiles in the state.

Counting for the Senate always takes longer than the House of Representatives, and it could take weeks to finalise the result.

96,"Albanese promises to bring Australians together, fully commits to Uluru Statement from the Heart — as it happened",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Newly elected prime minister Anthony Albanese says his team will work every day to bring Australians together, saying he will lead a government ""worthy of the people of Australia"". Look back at how the vote count unfolded here in our blog. By Caitlyn Davey This blog is closed but you can get more updates for Sunday, May 22, and see how the counts are unfolding on Sunday's blog. By Jessica Riga Thank you so much for your company throughout this huge day! You can catch up on all our election coverage here on our Australia Votes website. We'll be back tomorrow morning to bring you all the latest news and reactions from the federal election results as they continue to roll in. Until then, from all of us bloggers, have a good rest of your night! By Georgia Hitch After a mammoth evening, here are the key takeaways: By Nicholas McElroy By Nicholas McElroy  By Jessica Riga By Jessica Riga Here's political reporter Matthew Doran, who is in Labor HQ tonight. ""Do we sleep, or do we drink? I say drink!"" That was the declaration from one young Labor supporter, shortly after Anthony Albanese declared Australia was under new management. 'Working Class Man' by Cold Chisel started blaring, as the relief, laughter and joy spread across the room at the Canterbury-Hurlstone Park RSL. Three years ago, there were similar comments from the Labor faithful about the choice between drinking and sleeping. But the desire to neck a few beers was borne of mourning, rather than celebration. In May 2019, it was about an hour or two into the vote count when Labor's rank and file started to see the writing on the wall. They'd lost the unlosable election. Tears ran down faces, as people ran for the doors. The conference room near Essendon Airport was empty within minutes of Bill Shorten conceding the election and quitting as leader. Fast forward three years and, obviously, it was a different tone. The bloke from the public housing flat in Camperdown had just become Prime Minister — even though his command of the House with a majority is still to be determined. The party faithful couldn't give a stuff whether they reach 76 seats tonight. They just want to bask in the electoral glory. Anthony Albanese said his late mother was watching down on him tonight, and has said during the campaign he hoped she'd be proud. There's a few hundred other people here this evening who share that pride. By Nicholas McElroy Boris Johnson: ""Congratulations on your election as Prime Minister of Australia. I look forward to working with you as we reap the rewards of our comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, the AUKUS partnership and the unmatched closeness between the British and Australian people."" By Georgia Hitch Wentworth, the blue ribbon Liberal seat in Sydney, will also go to a so-called teal independent. Antony Green has called that Dave Sharma has lost his seat to independent Allegra Spender. With more than half the vote counted, the ABC projects Mr Sharma’s primary vote will fall below 40 per cent and he has suffered a substantial swing against him. It means the former ambassador will leave parliament after just one term. Ms Spender has worked in the UK Treasury as a policy analyst, and most recently as Managing Director at Carla Zampatti Pty Ltd, her family's fashion label. By Georgia Hitch Antony Green says there's enough votes in now to call Kooyong for Dr Monique Ryan, meaning Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will officially lose his seat. With more than half the vote counted, the ABC projects Mr Frydenberg’s vote has fallen by more than 6 per cent, and he will be defeated on preferences. Dr Ryan is one of a group of teal independents challenging inner-city Liberal MPs at this election. She has been director of the neurology department at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne Mr Frydenberg is a leader of the moderate wing of the Liberal Party, and was widely regarded as a potential future leader of the party. By Georgia Hitch We missed it before because Anthony Albanese was speaking but the counting has stopped in the eastern states for tonight, it stops at midnight local time around the country. It'll resume tomorrow, including postal votes. By Jessica Riga Labor MP Anika Wells has retained the seat of Lilley. The ALP was helped in the fight for the ultra-marginal electorate by candidate problems within the LNP. She says the decisive result was partially a reflection of her time in parliament, but also a rejection of the Prime Minister. “As a first term MP you spend every day and every night wondering if you are doing enough for your people, if you’re working hard enough and if they think you are doing enough for them,"" she said. ""When you get a result tonight like this one, it’s just really heartening to think that you went OK.” Ms Wells also pointed to the handling of the Omicron wave and the Brisbane floods as an influence on the vote in Lilley. “I think if you look overall across Queensland, the overwhelming sentiment is a rejection of the Prime Minister,"" she said. “Where that protest vote is going is patchy."" “My impression based on standing in pre-poll in the rain for 11 days is that Green vote really went up in the last 72 hours.” Reporting by Emilie Gramenz By Georgia Hitch Coalition Out: In doubt: Labor Out: In doubt: By Jessica Riga It's been a long night in the northern Victorian electorate of Nicholls – previously the safest coalition seat in the state. The Nationals have retained the seat, despite a tight race with Independent candidate Rob Priestly. But at the party for Nationals candidate Sam Birrell, the mood was bittersweet. His independent rival has hacked a significant chunk off the Nationals' vast 20 per cent margin, threatening the coalition's comfortable reign. And while Mr Birrell's party has retained the seat, it won't be under a Coalition government. He admitted the seat's stark swing against the Nationals tonight showed his party ""needs to listen to the electorate very carefully"". ""Having said that, I think all governments needed to make very difficult decisions during the pandemic,"" he said. ""The electorate is very annoyed and upset and independents offer a bet each way in that you can have a political representative who's not associated with the really difficult decisions either the Coalition or Labor might have to make. ""I don't think it's a good trend.""  Meanwhile in a speech to supporters, Mr Priestly said while he may not have claimed victory tonight, the seat is no longer a coalition stronghold. ""We've taken Nicholls from being one of the safest seats in the country, never discussed, never part of the national agenda, to being at the centre of the political discussion,"" he said. ""It may not have been this one, but it will be the next one or the one after for sure. ""Nicholls is going to be completely contestable every time."" Reporting by Charmayne Allison By Jessica Riga By Georgia Hitch Josh Frydenberg’s challenger in Kooyong, Dr Monique Ryan, a teal independent, has addressed her supporters to say thank you. ""Kooyong is never going to be quite the same again,” she said to the jubilant room, who clapped and cheered as she spoke. ""This is not a victory speech - it is just a thank you to all of you ... We started because we wanted action on climate change and we felt that it was the most important challenge of our time. ""It bloody well is. Our government was not listening to us, so, we have changed the government ... And that is the power of the people. “Everything that we have done, we have done with love. That's a strange word to be using in a political campaign, but that, there's been love. Most of us have never done anything like this before. I think that all of us will remember this as one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. ""We started with a very, very uneven playing field. We're evening it up."" By political reporter Kathleen Calderwood. By Georgia Hitch ""To my partner, Jodie. Thank you for coming in to my life and for sharing this journey. And to my proudest achievement, my son, Nathan. Thank you, mate, for your love and support. Your mother, who's here tonight, Carmel, we are both so proud of the caring, wonderful, smart young man you have become. ""To my mum. Who's beaming down on us. Thank you. And I hope there are families in public housing watching this tonight. Because I want every parent to be able to tell their child no matter where you live or where you come from, in Australia the doors of opportunity are open to us all. ""And like every other Labor government, we'll just widen that door a bit more. Friends, we have made history tonight. And tomorrow, together, we begin the work of building a better future. A better future for all Australians. Thank you very much."" By Nicholas McElroy Mr Albanese: ""I said I've been underestimated my whole life during the campaign. Now while all that is true, I have also been lifted up by others who saw something in me. And who encouraged me in life on this journey. ""And I pledged to the Australian people here tonight, I am here not to occupy the space, but to make a positive difference each and every day. ""And to the amazing diverse people of Grayndler. All politics is local. And in 1996, there were various people who wrote off the chances of Labor holding on to that seat. This is my 10th election. And I want to say thank you for placing your faith in me. It is an absolute honour to be your voice in our national parliament."" By Georgia Hitch ""My fellow Australians, no-one gets here by themselves. And I wouldn't be standing here tonight without the support, hard work and belief of so many people. To my parliamentary team, including my Deputy, Richard Marles, and my Senate leader, Penny Wong. My terrific economic team led by Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher,"" he said. ""On Monday morning, arrangements are in place to have these people sworn in as members of my team. To enable Penny and I to attend the important Quad leaders' meeting in Tokyo with President Biden, Prime Minister Kishida and Prime Minister Modi. And I want the leaders of the economic team to start work on Monday morning as well. I wanted to thank my shadow ministry and my amazing caucus members, including the people who are here tonight at this joint function. I want to thank all of our Labor candidates. ""I want to thank all those who have worked so hard for this victory. We stand on your shoulders. Most rank-and-file members of the Labor Party will never ask for anything. They knock on doors, they make calls, they work so hard. They hand out how-to-votes. They push the cause of Labor at the local P&C, the local kid's footy, the local netball, when they're shopping in the supermarket, when they talk to their neighbours. I thank each and every one of the true believers of the Australian Labor Party. ""And I proudly thank the members of the mighty trade union movement. ""I do want to thank my campaign director, our amazing national secretary, Paul Erickson, and his team. My staff are led by Tim Gartrell, my first campaign director back in 1996. And my electorate office team, who haven't seen that much of me, who look after this electorate led by Helen Rogers. ""Thank you very much. But to all those - and I'm not going to name them because there's too many - there's a lot of people who believed in me and backed me over many decades in this great movement to be where I am today."" By Jessica Riga ""We are the greatest country on earth. But we can have an even better future if we seize the opportunities that are right there in front of us.

97,"Bedrooms the size of closets, no repairs and a lot of mould: Welcome to Sydney's nightmare rental market",politics,"  Sydney has become a landlords' market and desperate renters are paying the price Long searches, skyrocketing prices, and diminishing quality. Sydney has become a landlord’s market, and desperate renters are paying the price. Advertised bedrooms that are no bigger than closets. A stair railing hanging loose from the wall. Bathrooms that don't have a door. Mould — and a lot of it. None of these details mentioned on recent rental listings asking for upwards of $1,000 in rent a week. For people who haven't been on a rental hunt in a while, this might sound like a horror story. But for those looking for a somewhat affordable home in Sydney's inner-city suburbs, it's a Saturday morning bingo card. Here's how it often plays out. Before you're even through the door, you'll be standing alongside up to 30 other hopefuls. You'll then be shuttled through the property, back to back, elbow to elbow, in an allotted 15 minutes. In the end, you find out at least three other groups have already offered above the asking price. And then, with fingers crossed, it's straight on to the next inspection. Rental vacancy rates across Greater Sydney dropped to 1.4 per cent in April, according to Domain, with the number of vacant rentals halved in the three months between December and March. Meanwhile, the median weekly asking price for a rental house is at a record high. In other words, Sydney is currently what you call a ""landlords' market"". Across the country, most states are seeing similar surges. According to Domain's latest rental report, the median price for house in Australian capital cities rose to $508 in the first three months of the year — the highest it's ever been. It's a far cry from the height of the pandemic, when the lack of international migration drove down rental prices and drastically increased vacancy rates. Across Greater Sydney, the vacancy rate peaked at 3.8 in April 2020, with similar highs recorded later in the pandemic. The impact of the current boom is palpable at rental inspections, as prospective tenants share stories of long searches, budgets above what they can afford to pay, and disappointment at the quality of what's available in their price range. And the crisis is not confined to the inner city. Mary Thoms has been looking for a property for herself and two young grandchildren in the Liverpool area since Christmas last year. At this point, she says she'll take whatever she can get. ""Waking up early in the morning, the first thing is that thought: get a house, a place, so you can have a roof over your head."" ""Every Friday I'm looking at Domain to see if there are any good houses or even units, that are three-bedroom and spacious."" ""But at the inspections, there's a lot of people, so you get rejected. It's heartache, I'm just tired of looking."" We speak to Mary outside an inspection for a four-bedroom townhouse in Casula in Sydney's west. At $580 a week, it's above the median price for the suburb — but well below the cost in suburbs closer to the CBD. The grandmother is currently living in a unit in Blacktown, which has been plagued with break-ins and maintenance issues that have not been fixed. Even though the price is above what she would like to pay, Mary says she's going to apply for the property. But she's not feeling optimistic. ""They're all going to apply,"" she says, referring to the handful of other groups there for the inspection. ""So we're going to apply, too."" The real estate agent also expects the property to go quickly; it's a modern family home with a yard, located right near Casula Public School. It's exactly the type of property currently in short supply and high demand in south-west Sydney, according to Michael Busdon, the property manager at Raine and Horne Liverpool. ""During the pandemic, house rentals increased and apartment rentals dropped, and we had to offer people rent reductions in order for them not to vacate their apartments,"" he says. ""It seems that house rental hopes have bolted a little, and now apartments are having their turn."" In a ""normal market"", he says, you would usually expect between five and eight people at a house inspection in his area. Now when a house is on the market, assuming it's in good condition and well-located, it's in excess of 16. To explain this you only need to look at the real estate's print-out of available properties; during the pandemic, it was four to five double-sided pages long — now it's down to one page, front and back. ""I have seen it worse than this,"" he says, referring to the early 2000s, when people would submit their application forms with cash attached ""as a bribe"". Thankfully, he hasn't seen that happen this time around, but adds: ""This could be just the beginning"". Unlike those queuing up for inspections, Michael doesn't see the booming rental market as an entirely bad thing. ""It depends what side of the fence you are on,"" he says, ""if you're a tenant, you're probably not liking what is happening, if you're a landlord, you're probably feeling a little bit relieved."" That's because for the first time in years, as migrants return to Sydney after border closures and renters get back to business as usual, landlords are in a position to increase rents — just as the reserve bank lifts interest rates for the first time in 11 years, adding to the monthly cost of mortgages. While there are major differences between the city rental market compared to the outer suburbs — the median rental price for a house in Blacktown in Sydney's west is exactly half that of the inner-city suburb of Surry Hills — Michael sees it as more of a continuum: when vacancy rates drop in the city centre, people start to nudge outwards out of desperation, eventually driving up prices and demand elsewhere. ""Gentrification happens in the rental market too,"" he says. Even with the push outwards, many are still scrambling to be close to the city whether it be for work, lifestyle, or convenience. Especially as prices increase across the board. ""I'm in the Campbelltown area which is just as expensive as the inner west,"" says 20-year-old Laila Sumner. ""I'm in a one-bedroom that doesn't even have a proper bathroom, just a toilet and a shower, and I still pay $300 a week."" Laila is hoping to move to the inner west with her partner to be closer to her job in the city, but outside an inspection for a two-bedroom apartment in a nondescript, red-brick building in Marrickville, the pair aren't optimistic about their options. ""The first place we looked at was a bit of a slum, it smelt of mould,"" Shay Wilson, 22, says. ""It was a terrace house that had been broken up into four separate apartments. I was like, 'ah, maybe not'. Everyone walked in and then straight back out."" As for the Marrickville apartment, advertised for $430 a week, the review wasn't much better. While it fell within their $400 to $500 a week budget, it was old and severely lacking in built-in storage. ""It's almost like a guessing game,"" Laila says. ""Nothing seems like it's priced fairly at all — it's kind of like 'Oh I think people will pay this for that house, let's just put it at that'."" At the same inspection is 25-year-old Madison McGrail who has good reason to be looking for a new place: she's just broken up with her partner who she lives with in Redfern. But timing is not on her side; since her most recent move in June last year, she says there are fewer available options and the ones that tend to be lower quality — even with a bigger budget of $550 a week. ""It's just yucky apartments out here,"" she says. Of the six places she'd inspected so far, she hadn't applied for any. ""The level of quality that people think they can show houses in [isn't acceptable],"" she says. ""I was at one the other day, and I was like 'is this place going to get cleaned again before we move in?'."" Eirene Tsolidis-Noyce is the general secretary of the newly-formed Renters and Housing Union (RAHU). The organisation was formed in response to the COVID pandemic, in an urgent bid to ensure renters who lost work as a result of lockdowns were able to remain in their homes. But as the pandemic has progressed, and lockdowns have eased, their attention has turned to issues within the home. ""We have black mould, seriously urgent repairs, hot water that's not running, electricity that's gone wrong,"" she says. ""The broader trend is that the properties we are living in are not kept to a minimum standard and the responses we receive from agents on our own, as tenants, are not adequate."" The median rental price for a house across Australia's capital cities hit a new record high in the first three months of this year. But it's not just Australians bearing the brunt of soaring rental costs. The time frames set out for landlords to respond to repairs differs between states. In NSW, tenants can organise for any urgent repairs — including broken hot water systems, blocked toilets, gas leaks, and broken stoves — to be fixed themselves and be reimbursed if the cost is under $1,000 and the landlord had a reasonable opportunity to respond to the request. But when it comes to non-urgent repairs, such as a broken dishwasher or mould, there's no avenue for tenants to go it alone with a guarantee to get their money back. Eirene says these sorts of requests often go answered. Part of this comes down to the lack of property availability: there's no urgency to make expensive repairs or improvements when tenants know there are few other options. On Crown Street in the trendy inner-city suburb of Surry Hills, a crowd has gathered outside an impressive looking three-story Victorian terrace. Despite the drizzling weather, the group huddle under umbrellas cradling takeaway coffees from the myriad of cafes on the block. Listed at $1,200 a week for four bedrooms and two bathrooms, the property is the most expensive we visit. It's also the most busy; between 30 to 40 people eventually show up for the inspection. At least one group is quick to walk straight back out. ""In the photos it looks like it's got bright lights or it's in the middle of the day,"" says Scotty Bensley, who arrived in Sydney late last year from New York. ""But when you go in the house it's super dark. There's a bit of Photoshop work."" For about two months, Scotty has been on a ""mad hunt"" for a place with his two friends after his temporary accommodation in Pyrmont began leaking. The group are realistic about the cost of living in the inner city — they're looking at any and all suburbs surrounding the CBD, from Surry Hills and Paddington to Newtown and Marrickville — and each person is prepared to pay up to $400 a week for their room. The most-recent place they applied for they negotiated above the asking price, but so far, it hasn't been enough. ""We're all 29 and 28, working men, but I guess there's a perception of a party house, young guys — we just want to find somewhere to live,"" he says. Recent university graduate Lola Trajkovic is also at the inspection hoping to find a share house for herself and three friends. After landing a full-time job, it's the 22-year-old Northern Beaches resident's first foray into the rental market. She thought the house was nice, but after speaking with the real estate agent, she says she was told they expect people to offer above the asking price — excluding her from the race. ""We've been looking at property websites for a couple of months, and I've found that even in the past two months they've increased in price,"" she says. ""We haven't started applying yet, but we're expecting to have a lot of trouble."" ""Our expectation at the moment is that we'll start looking, then we'll reassess, we'll lower our standards, and come back and try again."" After a tough two years, real estate agent Tom Jones believes it's a positive time for landlords, many of who took a significant hit to their normal cash flow during the pandemic. This, he says, is because the cost of owning property in Sydney is also ""drastically high"". ""Even though these rents seem to be high for tenants, if you're an investor looking at it on a yield basis, it's still not a good return."" As the leasing and new business manager at Village Property, an agency that specialises in rentals across the Sydney metro area, north shore, southern suburbs, and Parramatta, Tom's witnessed firsthand what he calls ""a drastic change in the market"" that began towards the end of January summer holidays. But while that means good news for his clients, he's sympathetic to the plight of renters: ""It's definitely difficult in this market for renters to get their applications approved because there's a lot of options for landlords."" With more competition, Tom says applicants are finding innovative ways to get noticed. While many with the means go straight to the offering more money route, others are trying a more personal approach; some are calling agents directly ahead of time ""so they know who you are"", while others bring along printed out biographies or statements to the inspection. Talking points about inflation and interest rates delivered by politicians on mammoth salaries feel far removed from the reality of the cost of living crisis on the ground, as hundreds of new people turn to food banks to survive. But asked what the best thing applicants can do to secure the keys, Tom returns to old-school advice. ""If you're really good at submitting your application with all the documents and information, and have everything ready like your references and tenancy ledger, it makes it easier for us to present your application to the owner quicker,"" he says. ""[It's also] important to build that rapport at the inspection and let the agent know that you're interested, that way we know where to spend our time and efforts looking into things."" Two weeks after meeting Mary at the inspection in Casula, we give her a call to ask how she went with the application. As of last Saturday, she hadn't heard anything back. ""It's pretty disheartening when you don't hear from them,"" she says. ""It gets so exhausting that you say you'll take whatever, but still that's not even happening. It's just waiting, waiting, waiting, and then you continue the search."" She's since widened her radius, meaning she'll be looking at places further away from where her children live. But she's desperate, and there's a deadline looming: her grandson is celebrating his third birthday in June and she'd like to do something nice in a new home. ""It's all about the children, as long as I have a nice place for the children,"" she says. ""But finding a decent one is like winning the lottery.""

98,The main question at the heart of the election campaign hasn't been answered,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Before what feels like the interminable 2022 election campaign began, Labor was testing advertising with voters in focus groups. The party's leader, Anthony Albanese, wanted to have his beloved little white fluffy dog, Toto, in some of the ads, prompting conniptions from Labor's advertising consultants. ""No,"" they were heard to cry. ""Just no!"" Little white fluffy dogs might be very nice. But do they convey the sorts of images about leadership that we want in our leaders? Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Years ago, the former general secretary of the NSW Labor Party, John Della Bosca, perhaps unwisely observed in an interview that former federal leader Kim Beazley needed to convey a bit more political mongrel. Cartoonist Patrick Cook promptly drew a picture of Beazley walking into a pet shop with an ALP apparatchik. ""We want to buy a mongrel!"" the apparatchik demands. ""Do you have any fluffy ones?"" inquires Beazley. So, it's been amusing to watch Toto turning up in social media content, which has been harder for the hard heads to control. There was Toto on Albanese's social media accounts, for example, sitting next to him at the dining room table while the Opposition Leader was in COVID isolation working on his campaign launch speech. Appearances aren't, and shouldn't be, everything. But, they are a lot in politics. Much was made about Albanese's appearance by the Coalition in the early days of the campaign: that he had lost weight, got different glasses. The suggestion was they were all signs that he was a bit of a fake. But that was in the days before a prime minister who invented his Daggy Dad persona got entangled up in his own remake: a man who decided a week ago that changing was a good thing; conceding that he had in the past been a ""bit of a bulldozer"", then reversing that... sort of. By Friday morning, veteran radio host Neill Mitchell was asking Scott Morrison: ""So what? Are you a bulldozer with different gearing? Or a whipper snipper? Or a lawnmower?"" A bulldozer with a different gear, apparently. But one who, in a bad turn for appearances, was seen to have crash-tackled a small child on a football pitch. How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' These pictures, and word pictures, are both the fluff and the crucial elements of an election campaign. But 2022 has been a campaign more than most where the two leaders have been defining themselves in terms of each other. While the Prime Minister has been arguing that he is the strong leader, the man who has made the tough decisions, he as much as Albanese seem to have been running their campaigns by playing against, being defined by, what they think the other represents, not by what they necessarily are selling themselves. That is, the ""You might think I am not very good but the other guy is even worse"" pitch. Whatever both are selling, the daggy dad and the boy from the council housing signify the long-term shift in the images politicians use to sell themselves to us. They are just like us now: the everyman who stumbles and makes mistakes, not the leaders who strived to look like all-knowing patricians who we wanted to respect. Equally, and rather bizarrely when you think about it, the campaign has seen a certain passive tone on the question of what a Morrison or Albanese government can do for us. In an ideological sense, that is more understandable from a Coalition which doesn't really believe in government and which indeed proudly says it wants to get government out of our lives and our faces. But in its efforts to get into government by sticking as close as possible to the Coalition on the greatest number of issues, Labor, too, has not been too keen to suggest it has much influence over events or policies that can change the country. Throughout six weeks of campaigning, the two major parties seeking to lead Australia have laid out their respective visions for the future. Here's what has been put on the table. Its greatest transformative eventual ambition is universal childcare — which would indeed be transformative for many working women — but beyond that, the most transformative thing it is promising is about making government honest through an integrity commission. This, of course, would be no small thing. But it is about government, not about the policies it might make. Consider the biggest hip pocket issues at present: the cost of living and the cost of housing. When Scott Morrison was asked on early morning television on Friday about falling real wages, the challenge wasn't that wages weren't rising but inflation was running at twice the rate of wages. Inflation, he said, was ""coming from outside Australia"". In other words, beyond the power of the government to fix, apart from a few once-off, short-term handouts. Anthony Albanese has argued for an increase in the minimum wages equivalent to inflation, but notes that this is not his decision, but that of the Fair Work Commission. Similarly, with housing, the Coalition's big policy move is to let people use their own money held in super to pay for their own homes. Labor's policy might offer a (repayable) contribution from government to a home deposit, but only to a lucky 10,000 households. Even after a pandemic which left us both reliant on, and at the mercy of, government and public health policy functioning well, our political parties don't seem to believe we will trust them to transform their lives. In the case of the Coalition, they don't even seem enthusiastic about cleaning up the messes in government that have been taking place on their watch — like the delivery of government services for the aged and disabled. The domestic pressures on the incoming government will be to fix these fundamental services they are supposed to provide, and try to bring some order to the chaotic state of the budget and how it is spent. And it will be doing this at a time when there will be demands on its time from the outside world in a way possibly unprecedented since 1945. Australia's strategic situation means that we will no longer be simply able to passively sit and watch the superpowers arguing among themselves, or even choose to insert ourselves into global issues where we feel like it as we were once able to do, like peace settlements in Cambodia or ending the Apartheid regime. At home and abroad there will be pressures to transform Australia. This election may also see another step in the transformation of the bases of our major political parties: the drift of the Coalition away from its well-heeled base to the outer suburbs. And Labor possibly winning government without winning back some of its traditional base. Just how whoever wins the election will deal with such immense challenges is the real question to be resolved on May 21, 2022. Laura Tingle is 7.30's chief political correspondent.

99,When will we know the result of Australia's 2022 federal election?,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes When will we have an election result? It's the big election question that no one has a satisfying answer for just yet. That's because it all comes down to how close the race is between the two major parties by the end of today. So, at a bare minimum, we will start to get election results from some time from 6pm AEST onwards. Although there has been a high number of early votes this election, a new law will allow the electoral commission to start sorting votes early — from 4pm to be exact. ""We will hopefully not be up as late as in 2016 and 2019. There is a new law that permits the electoral commission to start sorting pre-poll votes by 4pm on Saturday,"" the ABC's chief election analyst, Antony Green, says. That means staff will be able to prepare votes so they are able to be sorted and counted right away from 6pm. ""Hopefully, they can get to the count of pre-polls quicker,"" Green says. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Green will be popping up regularly on your ABC screens after polls close. The updates will also be coming through in our live blog. You can follow all of the latest election updates in our live blog, and the rolling coverage on the ABC News Channel. After 6pm, results will start to be released by the Australian Electoral Commission. As they come in, the results will be fed into the ABC election computer managed by Green. Green — who is usually the first to call Australian elections — will monitor the data and call the election based on the results. In March, Green called the South Australian state election at roughly 7:30pm. At the 2021 WA election, he called the result at about 8:40pm. The last federal election in 2019 was called by Green at about 9:30pm. He says one of the earliest elections he called was at roughly 7pm in 2013, when it looked obvious Labor had lost the election. Again, it depends on how close the result is. With a bit more of the vote counted now, Green's given his latest update and the main message is things are messy because primary votes are split across a bunch of different parties — not just Labor and the Coalition. Green says it could be 'two or three weeks' to work out who forms government. How Labor won amid the 'teal wave' If most of the polling throughout the election is correct, and Labor has a 53 per cent lead, Green says a trend will emerge pretty early. However, if the polls are incorrect, we may have to wait longer for a result. The latest polls have shown a tightening in the race between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese. It's worth keeping in mind that polling was wrong in the last election and has been in other major elections.

100,"Bushfires, reef bleaching, animal extinctions — Australia's environment is under threat. But are our politicians paying attention?",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Australia's environment — the places and animals that make the continent unique — has been a conversation point for communities and government in the past few years, but it's had relatively little attention for most of the election campaign. It's hard to forget the devastation wrought in 2020, as the Black Summer bushfires killed or displaced an estimated 3 billion animals, or the impacts this year when the sixth mass bleaching event hit the Great Barrier Reef. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Koalas were listed as endangered across most of the east coast and we saw warnings that some of our ecosystems are heading for collapse. This all occurred while Australia remained atop an unenviable list, as the nation with the highest mammal extinction rate. It's against this backdrop that the next government will be measured, by those concerned with Australia's environmental standing. Labor has left it until the closing days of the campaign, but has now released an ambitious set of environmental policies, which marks a significant difference from what the Morrison government is offering. Climate change is being buried this election. So we asked some of Australia's leading climate scientists for their verdict on how the major parties' policies stack up. While the Morrison government's platform continues its existing measures, Labor is saying it will also honour those, and increase investment in several of them -- plus it's added a suite of new policies that aim to ease the extinction crisis and make Australia a global leader on environmental issues. Since the Coalition came to power, it has mostly copped criticism from environment groups. According to the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Coalition has cut spending on the environment as a proportion of the total budget by about 40 per cent since 2013. In the case of Australia's action — or inaction — on climate change, the science has something to say, writes Michael Slezak. Perhaps as a result of that funding cut, it has failed to develop recovery plans for more than 200 threatened species — a key mechanism under federal environment law to help reverse the decline of threatened species. And when it commissioned a landmark review into federal environmental laws by former ACCC boss Graham Samuel, Samuel said that if the government didn't implement the key reforms he recommended, it would be accepting ""the continued decline of our iconic places and the extinction of our most threatened plants, animals and ecosystems."" The government did not implement the reforms. Labor had been critical of much of this during its time in opposition but offered little in the way of a concrete alternative until this week. Now, Labor has said it will implement one of the Samuel Review's key reforms — establishing a federal Environmental Protection Agency to ensure compliance with environmental laws. And it has promised a full response to the rest of the review if it wins government. Last week, Labor promised $224.5 million over four years for its Saving Native Species Program,which it says will help clear that backlog of recovery plans, and help reduce the extinction rate in Australia. Combined with Labor's stronger policies on emissions reductions, the policies have won praise from conservation groups. Australian Marine Conservation Society chief executive Darren Kindleysides said that if enacted properly, the policies ""will bring a desperately needed boost to the protection of our oceans and threatened wildlife, which has been hamstrung by outdated and ineffective laws, weak enforcement and poor resourcing"". When a federal EPA has been mooted previously, the idea has been opposed by the mining lobby group, the Minerals Council of Australia, who said it would add to ""red and green tape which delays projects, costs jobs and threatens competitiveness."" When it comes to the Great Barrier Reef, the Morrison government announced in January it would invest a further $1 billion dollars in water quality, reef management and research. That was widely applauded by conservationists, most of whom complained, however, the government was not doing enough about the reef's biggest threat: climate change. Labor says it will continue that funding, and top it up with a further $194.5 million to help restore damaged reefs; to work with farmers to reduce pollution running onto the reef; and for additional research funds for heat-tolerant corals. Among the environmental issues the Morrison government has championed while in office is recycling. It's established a $280 million Recycling Modernisation Fund, trying to kick-start a ""circular economy"" in Australia. Labor is pledging to continue that, and strengthen it with a further $60m, as well as making sure that when the government itself buys things, they are more often made of recycled materials. Both parties are boosting Landcare (which facilitates local groups to help improve the environment) as well as the Indigenous Ranger program. Labor has also announced a $200m plan to improve urban rivers, and a set of initiatives intended to establish Australia as a leading player in international environmental programs and negotiations. The Greens have released a comprehensive environmental policy, which — like Labor — promises a federal Environmental Protection agency. Its plan also includes a target of zero extinctions by 2030, and a $24.5 billion investment over 10 years to restore wildlife habitat and the planting of 2 billion trees by 2030. The party wants to end native forest logging — an industry that has been implicated in increasing bushfire risk and contributing to the decline of threatened species — but which is often supported by Labor and Liberal-National governments. And the Greens have a range of other strong policies including phasing out single-use plastics and expanding Marine Protected Areas. The ""teal"" independents have a range of policies on the environment. They are all campaigning on strong emissions cuts, but many also have policies — which range in terms of detail — aiming to protect habitats and animals. On the other end of the spectrum, One Nation wants Australia to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, build more coal fired power stations and many more dams. It's clear Labor plans to do more than the Coalition to stop extinctions, and protect the places and habitats many Australians value. And, if we wind up with a minority government come Saturday night, odds are both major parties would be pushed for further action by the Greens, or independents on the crossbench.

102,"Labor the frontrunner on election day, but Coalition still sees a path to victory",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Polls have opened across the country and Australians have only a few more hours to cast their votes and determine whether Scott Morrison and his Coalition or Anthony Albanese and Labor will lead the nation for the next three years. Labor, which has spent almost a decade in opposition, arrives at election day feeling it has the best chance to form majority government. The Coalition concedes its electoral path to a fourth term in office is narrow but still possible. The Australian Electoral Commission is forecasting half of all votes will have already been cast before today, up from 40 per cent in 2019. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. Mr Morrison and Mr Albanese spent the last day of the campaign making their final pitch to voters. For the Prime Minister, it was warning voters not to change government, to stick with the party that led Australia through the COVID-19 pandemic. ""We're turning the corner and we're getting the pandemic behind us. We can't take the risk of turning back now,"" Mr Morrison said. The Opposition Leader urged voters that the only way to improve their standard of living would be to change the government. ""There's three more years of the same, or there is myself, who wants to bring the country together,"" Mr Albanese said. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Irrespective of who wins, the next government will have to contend with soaring inflation, real wages going backwards, a budget with close to a trillion dollars in debt, a war in Eastern Europe and a more assertive China in the Pacific. Labor started the six-week campaign ahead in the polls, with the weight of expectation on Mr Albanese's shoulders. The polls, both public and internal, have tightened but the opposition retains a slight advantage. The Coalition started the election notionally with 76 seats — the slimmest margin to govern in majority. Labor, which notionally has 69 seats, needs a net gain of seven seats to form majority government. A net gain of four seats would get the ALP ahead of the Coalition. Both sides expect the Liberal seats of Reid, in Sydney, Boothby, in Adelaide, and Swan, in Perth, to fall to Labor. The opposition also hopes to pick up extra seats in WA, northern Tasmania, south-east Queensland and affluent suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne. The Coalition's most likely prospect is the NSW south coast seat of Gilmore, with hopes in Corangamite, outside Geelong in Victoria, and in Northern Territory. Senior sources within the Liberal Party remain hopeful it can make inroads into safer Labor seats in outer suburban electorates, like Blair in Queensland and McEwen in Victoria. Complicating the path to 76 for the major parties is the threat of teal independents, many of whom are posing a serious threat to moderate Liberals in what were once safe seats. The final day of campaigning began with a change in voting rules to allow more people with COVID-19 to cast their ballot by phone. The Australian Electoral Commissioner has warned that could mean people would face lengthy delays voting on the phone. Party sources have told the ABC that polling suggests women are backing Labor at a greater proportion than men, with the opposite for the Coalition. Mr Albanese seized on that and recruited former prime minister Julia Gillard to make a rare political appearance on the campaign trail. He spent the day in Sydney, Adelaide, Launceston and Melbourne. Mr Morrison spent the bulk of the day visiting seats in Perth and was joined by his wife, Jenny, who has highly visible on the campaign trail. Mr Morrison and Mr Albanese have both faced highs and lows throughout the election. The Opposition Leader's day one gaffe, where he was unable to state the unemployment rate, dominated the first week of the campaign. A week in isolation after contracting COVID-19 allowed Labor the chance to reset its campaign. The Prime Minister, having faced months of criticisms about his leadership — both in and outside his party — wanted an election on the economy and national security. He got both but not how he wanted, with China signing a security pact with Solomon Islands and a mid-campaign interest rate hike. Both leaders will start election day in Melbourne before returning to Sydney to vote and for evening events.

103,Albanese criticises 'some of the nonsense' election coverage as on-the-day voters set to decide his fate,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has hit out at some political journalists and their coverage of the election campaign, saying it is putting some Australians off politics. On the eve of a closely fought federal election, the Labor leader described some of the media pack's behaviour and coverage over the past six weeks as ""nonsense"". Mr Albanese created headlines at the start of the campaign when he could not name the unemployment rate. He apologised for the ""memory lapse"" and insists he ""owned it"" but, afterwards, he was repeatedly quizzed by journalists to list details of his policies. Some of his team have been increasingly annoyed by the behaviour of a few journalists and media outlets. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog During a wideranging interview with 7.30, Mr Albanese made it clear he was frustrated as well. ""With respect, some of the nonsense that's gone on from some of the journalists thinking that the campaign was about them and gotcha moments is one of the things that puts people off politics,"" he said. The Labor leader has been criticised by some of his own supporters and pundits for not putting forward more policy ideas, and running a small-target strategy. However, when asked whether he should be vowing to do more for some of the poorest Australians, he said he would not over-promise and under-deliver for voters. ""What I will deliver is what I say I will deliver,"" Mr Albanese said. In a final pitch to undecided Australians heading to cast their ballots on Saturday, Mr Albanese also outlined his main priorities if he were to win the nation's highest political office. ""Cheaper child care, cheaper energy bills, a future made in Australia, end the climate wars, a national anti-corruption commission, and move forward with the constitutional recognition of First Nations people with a voice to parliament,"" he said. National opinion polls throughout this campaign have consistently suggested Labor has a healthy lead on a two-party preferred basis. Newspoll on Friday had the Opposition ahead 53 to 47. However, the situation in key seats is considered to be much tighter than those surveys suggest. Both major parties are spinning that they are favoured or experiencing a last-minute surge. ""I think it will be tight everywhere,"" a Coalition minister said. ""There is a path for us to win a majority but it is very tight and a hung parliament seems more likely right now."" The Liberal and National Parties can't afford to lose any seats to retain a majority, while Labor needs to win seven and not lose any to win government. A majority Coalition government is now considered by campaign strategists to be the least likely outcome. Five seats are thought to be most at risk of falling to Labor or the Greens: Brisbane (Qld), Reid (NSW), Chisholm (Vic), Boothby (SA) and Swan (WA). There are also many other electorates where the Coalition is being closely challenged by the Opposition and high-profile independents. Those include Wentworth (NSW), Longman (Qld), Leichhardt (Qld), Goldstein (Vic), Higgins (Vic), Nicholls (Vic), Bass (Tas) and Pearce (WA). Some in Labor say they are now ""quietly confident"" of at least being the biggest party by the end of Saturday evening and potentially winning a small majority. However, they expect to have to pick up one or two electorates in every state, as opposed to experiencing the benefit of a big national swing. There is also some concern about how preferences from right-wing minor parties such as the Liberal Democrats, One Nation and the United Australia Party could flow, particularly in Queensland. ""If it all goes bad tomorrow and we're trying to work out what happened, that's where I'd start,"" said one senior Labor frontbencher. The Coalition is still hoping it can offset some of its losses by taking a seat or two off Labor. Its targets include Blair (Qld), Gilmore (NSW), Parramatta (NSW), Lingiari (NT) and Corangamite (Vic). It has not been a campaign filled with many major policy announcements. Instead, large periods of time have been focused on ""gaffes"" or personal attacks. As a result, neither leader is particularly well-liked and, in parts of the country, the Prime Minister is considered very unpopular. While campaigning in Perth on Friday, Scott Morrison again shrugged off criticism and declared he could defy the polls, urging the so-called ""quiet Australians"", presumably referring to undecided voters, to stick with him. ""This isn't an election about me, or Mr Albanese, for that matter,"" Mr Morrison said. ""It's about you and what your aspirations are. It's about what you're hoping to achieve."" ""Those opportunities are there, but we cannot take them for granted."" In his final pitch to voters, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce declared his National Party would continue to stand up for regional areas against what he claimed was the ""Zeitgeist that socially belittles those who underpin the wealth of our nation"". ""What the Nationals see as providing a fair outcome for people away from the capital cities, the Labor Party sneer at as pork-barrelling,"" he said. ""We stand up for jobs in mining, which the Labor Party believes [is] politically incorrect,"" he said. ""The Nats have a plan, to make our nation as strong as possible as quickly as possible and we accept we may be sneered at as we achieve that."" Millions of Australians have already cast their ballot or have applied for a postal vote, which should ease pressure on polling places on Saturday. The Australian Electoral Commission had been worried about staffing shortages and long lines due to workers pulling out after contracting COVID-19. However, as of Friday night, all planned polling stations will open on Saturday morning. ""Our 105,000 workforce across Australia has had approximately 15 per cent turnover in the past week alone, and this risk will continue tomorrow morning,"" electoral commissioner Tom Rogers said. ""To those people working for us tomorrow, thank you for putting your hand up. Please, unless you wake up [COVID symptoms], come in to work to make sure that your polling place can open. ""To voters, if there is a queue, remember to treat our staff with kindness. You wouldn't have a local polling place with them.""

104,Labor leader Anthony Albanese speaks on ABC 7.30,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes On the eve of the federal election Opposition leader Anthony Albanese speaks to Leigh Sales on ABC 7.30. Catch up on the interview with our live blog below. By Jacqueline Howard This is where we will wrap things up. Thanks for joining us for this short but sweet blog of the Prime Minister's appearance on 7.30. Don't forget to check out the ABC's special Federal Election page on the website for more details and expert analysis from the election. If you missed the interview or want to watch it back, check out the show on ABC iView or you can watch back on the ABC's YouTube channel. By Jacqueline Howard  Just in case you didn't know, the election is tomorrow! So, if you're still not sure where your political views align with the major political parties, now might be a good time to check out the ABC's Vote Compass. Check it out here. By Jacqueline Howard That's a wrap from the interview. Here's what you thought about Anthony Albanese's performance. Feels like Ms Sales is being a lot more interrogative of Labor’s policies than she was of LNP’s policies when she interviewed Morrison. Professional interview. Albo presented Labor's policy agenda without resorting to knocking the LNP. By Jacqueline Howard Sales asks: What would you say to a voter on Fowler who might think ""Labor's parachuted in Kristina Keneally, who doesn't live in our seat and I don't want a rich white woman from somewhere else to come in. I'll take the local who knows my concerns, who speaks Vietnamese and who gets our community."" Albanese: What I'd say is that Kristina Keneally is a senior member of the Labor Party. She served as Premier of New South Wales. She's passionate about making a difference in politics, including to the community of Fowler in south-west Sydney. She will have a seat around the Cabinet table and will make an enormous difference to that electorate. Kristina is someone with great capacity, intelligence and able to advocate for that community. She'll be an outstanding, strong representative, and I'm sure that they'll be very proud of what she's able to deliver as part of a Labor government. Sales then quotes from the opinion polls, that after a 6-week campaign, about a third of voters don't want to vote for either major party. She asks, without reference to the Coalition, what does that say to Mr Albanese about Labor? Albanese: Well, Labor's primary vote is up ... We've seen over a period of time, a drift away from the tradition whereby people were born into a Labor family or a conservative family. Society has changed. And we have far more various views and a growth of minor parties. But every opinion poll shows that Labor, in terms of our primary vote, is attracting more support than we did at the last election or the one before that, or the one before that. By Jacqueline Howard  Mr Albanese is asked about Labor's promise to attract high performers to the teaching profession. She says the issue is not necessarily about attracting new teachers to the workforce, but retaining teachers because of the workload and the stress. Here's how he responded: Well, one of the things that we can do is to take some pressure off the education system.  We make no apologies for the policy about attracting more high-performance teachers into the profession. We need to value teaching. It's an honourable profession. And we need to lift its status. We have a range of other policies that we've announced, including funding for schools to bounce back from COVID. We know that students and teachers have done it really tough. And providing a additional support for every school for mental health support or for excursions in order to, according to the priorities of those schools, will make a difference as well. Sales then asks Mr Albanese about the Coalition's promise to allow some prospective home-buyers to draw on their super to make a deposit. She asks: What shouldn't Australians have a choice of what to do with their super savings as the Morrison Government is offering? Here's how Albanese responded: Because we don't think that you should get an asset by getting rid of another asset. And what we have here is a policy that is consistent with the Government that has undermined superannuation every opportunity that it has had. We already know that women retire with less income than men. This Government have continued to undermine superannuation at every step. And we don't believe this is a policy that didn't last, really, until the Monday morning, when Minister Hume went on TV and said this would push up house prices and therefore, wouldn't provide any substantial benefit. Sales then pivots to renewables. She asks what year Mr Albanese thinks that Australia will be out of coal production? Albanese: That will be determined by decisions in board rooms here in Australia and around the world. Sales: So, what do you mean by that? Do you mean that the private sector will choose whether or not there's a market for coal? And what is the role for Government? Albanese: The role for Government is our Powering Australia plan that provides a mechanism of support for renewables. Under our plan, renewables will be 82 per cent of the national energy market by 2030. That plan will see the creation of 604,000 additional jobs. Five out of every six in regional Australia. It will deliver some $52 billion of private sector investment. Sales: But you haven't done any modelling to check, what would the timeline therefore be for a full transition out of coal into renewables? Albanese: Well, the reputechs have done, Australia's leading energy economics firm, Reputex, and what they found is the figures coming through. There hasn't been a new coal fired power station built under this Government. And one can expect that there's no signs of that continuing in the... Changing in the future, because the market is speaking. The cheapest form of new energy in Australia is renewables. There's great prospect in areas like green hydrogen and other emerging industries as well. That is what is happening, and it's being driven by the market. And during the last election campaign, the Federal Government in another example of waste committed millions of dollars to the proponents of a new coal-fired power station in Colinsville that hasn't happened and won't happen, because it doesn't stack up in terms of the energy market. By Jacqueline Howard Leigh Sales asks Mr Albanese how Labor will, in the short-term, fix the issue of business owners struggling to fill staffing vacancies. Albanese: Well, we will have 465,000 fee-free TAFE places in areas of skills shortage. We'll also have an additional 20,000 university places. We understand that we need to train Australians for those jobs. Sales: But sorry to interrupt you, but the gaps are there right now. So there's urgent need right now and the policies don't fix it right now? Albanese: Well, you can't just change ten years of damage in one day. What you need to do is train people for those jobs. You need also to look at the migration system. I've said that very up-front in areas like nurses, historically Australia is a great migration country. One of the things that we need to do, though, is to be less reliant upon temper labour, and one of the things that we can task Jobs Australia, a body we will set up that will include private representatives and business representatives as well as different levels of Government, is to identify what are the skills that we'll need this year, next year, five years, ten years time? How do we train Australians for those jobs? How does the migration system fit in with that, and make sure that we get a better match-up of the labour market with the skills that Australia needs. By Jacqueline Howard  Leigh Sales tries to call Albanese out on an occurrence at the beginning of the campaign trail, when he failed to recall the unemployment figure. Mr Albanese disputed her summary of the situation. Read the exchange below: Sales: During the campaign, you made the unemployment figure mistake. You said this week that Australia's borders were closed when they're not. You supported a 5.1 per cent wage increase and then wound it back to say that it would only be for minimum wage earners. Albanese: That's not right. Sales: You did. Albanese: That's not right! Sales: You said it the first time and then you clarified. Albanese: That's not right. That's not right. Some of the nonsense that has gone on! Sales: It is. Albanese: I'll tell you what happened. We were asked a question. We were asked a question about if the Fair Work Commission came out with a 5.1 per cent increase, would you welcome it? And I said absolutely. Absolutely I would. Sales: You didn't specify... You specified a couple of days later. Albanese: No, that's not right. That's not right. And during this campaign, with respect, some of the nonsense that's gone on from some of journalists... Thinking that the campaign was about them and gotcha moments is one of the things that puts people off politics. The whole debate that day was about the case that is before the Fair Work Commission on the minimum wage increase. That's what the case is about. Sales: I take your point about about some of the questioning that people ask. But let me ask you about the unemployment figure one. People make mistakes, so I'm not siding you about that. But it really did set your campaign off to a shaky start. What actually happened there? Did you not know it? What actually happened? Albanese: I fessed up to just having a memory lapse at that particular time in that context. I'm not about making excuses. I owned it. And moved on. Sales: OK. By Jacqueline Howard Leigh Sales continues questions on the pandemic, and puts it to Albanese that, under Mr Morrison's leadership, ""the outcomes for Australia are among the best in the world"". Here's how Mr Albanese responded: ""Our health system, because of Medicare, is one of the best in the world, if not the best. Australians responded magnificently to the challenges. That's what Australians do. The strength of our Australian society was shown. ""But also, at the same time, the vulnerabilities of our economy, the fact that we're at the end of global supply chains meant that we didn't have enough PPE, we didn't have enough ventilators, we struggled to get access to vaccines. ""The problem for this Government is that they don't have a plan for the future. And during the pandemic, we were responsible, we were constructive, we didn't play politics. We actually went into the Parliament and said 'we have some disagreements with this legislation, but in advance, if our amendments aren't carried, we won't allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good'."" Leigh Sales asks Mr Albanese about Labor's 2016 campaign claim that Medicare would be privatised under the Coalition. Mr Albanese concedes it has not been privatised, but asserts the health system has become more difficult to access. ""Well, what we had last year was some 900 changes to the Medicare schedule, including for things like hip surgery and those changes not brought forward in a way that was transparent. ""What people out there know is that right now, it's harder to see a GP. Harder to see a doctor. That's one of the reasons why we have our urgent care clinics proposals. And I stand by our policies about strengthening Medicare. We know that the incoming Health Minister, if this government is re-elected tomorrow, has said in the past that the Medicare system is unsustainable."" By Jacqueline Howard  Mr Albanese put the credit on the general public and said Mr Morrison's lack of urgency meant the response to the pandemic was worse. ""The Australian people have been magnificent. They responded by looking after each other, whether they were people in the care sector or just people going out and getting vaccinated. ""But what we know is that the impact was worse from the pandemic because Scott Morrison said it wasn't a race for getting the vaccines to Australia. And then he did the same thing when it came to rapid antigen tests. When it came to issues like economic support, Scott Morrison described wage subsidies as a dangerous idea. ""Eventually they put it in and when they did put it in, they designed a scheme that gave $20 billion to companies who were actually increasing their profits, even though they knew that that was happening. They didn't adjust in the same way that New Zealand, for example, did.""

105,"With the rarest Pokemon finally spotted in the wild, this is how the campaign ends",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes This is how the campaign ends. Not with a bang, but with a squirt of jet fuel as Bulldozer Airways and Albo Force One zoom around the continent in a final burst of activity. The Prime Minister went all the way west — visiting Swan, Pearce and Hasluck, all Coalition-held electorates ranging from ""in deep strife"" to ""probably fine"". Labor leader Anthony Albanese, meanwhile, went to Adelaide and the seat of Sturt to tickle another former prime minister out of the woodwork. They've been pretty rare Pokemon over the past six weeks, apart from John Howard, who's been trundled out in all the electorates Morrison dare not visit. Paul Keating has held his peace apart from a single, majestic snort of contempt when the government announced its intention to smash his superannuation piggy bank. Tony Abbott has distributed some low-risk hostage videos, Kevin Rudd's done a spot of freelancing, and Malcolm Turnbull, having exiled himself to New York, has permitted himself only periodic acts of mischief. But yesterday, Anthony Albanese managed to convince Julia Gillard — the 27th prime minister of Australia, and the former PM least-given to interference in contemporary politics — to join him for a campaign stop. Gillard made a rare exception to her standing policy to stay the hell out of domestic politics because — she said today — she believes an Albanese government would be better for women. ""What I want to see for this country is a government that cares about, values and includes women,"" she said. Kind of a gracious gesture on her part, given that Albanese was a long-term supporter of Kevin Rudd's, and a very solid part of the reason Australia stopped having a female PM when it did. But that's politics. Full of forgiveness. It's six weeks old now, this campaign. And after 42 days of two men doing their best to seem exactly the right combination of sincere, articulate, empathetic and yet commanding, yesterday's Financial Review/Ipsos poll found that a full third of Australians still isn't very keen on either of them. What will history recall of this marathon flogfest, apart from the ""There's a hole in your costings, dear Labor, dear Labor"" jingle that's now being sung by millions of children thanks to its regular appearance on YouTube Kids, a phenomenon driving even Liberal-voting parents to the brink of nervous collapse? Well, it's hard to forget the first day of the campaign, on which a sheepish Anthony Albanese confessed himself unable to recall what the unemployment rate was. Whatever anyone says about the gotcha questions that flowed from this moment (""How many biscuits in a packet of Tim Tams — the double coat variety?"" ""Can you calculate pi to 13 places?"" ""What's the gestational period of the long-nosed potoroo?"" and so on), this was a bad moment and the nauseous look on Albanese's face confirmed it. But we all have moments we regret. In the first debate, for example, in Brisbane, the PM responded to a mother asking about the NDIS for her autistic child with the introductory obligation that ""Jenny and I have been blessed, we have two children who haven't had to go through that."" We know now, of course, that this conversational sally — which set off no alarms as it made its journey from prime ministerial frontal lobe all the way through to the point it became audible to other humans — was felt in an extremely salty way by every parent who's ever had to endure stupid remarks or inappropriately-offered prayers in car parks, playgrounds, doctors' waiting rooms or supermarket check out queues. The candidates covered a lot of territory. Sometimes more than once. The PM went SIX times to the Tasmanian seat of Bass, which is Liberal, but only by the breadth of the tenderest body part of the male bee. As Sod's law would have it, this seat is held by Bridget Archer, the Liberal MP who has been probably the most troublesome to Morrison. In her single term in office, she has crossed the floor to defy him on the government's non-appearing integrity commission, stuck up for trans kids and made it known that she didn't appreciate the bullying tactics of his office. Here is a photo of the pair mutually enjoying one of their six catch-ups. The PM also has been six times to the Labor seats of Lyons, also in Tasmania, and Parramatta, which is in western Sydney. Albanese also has been to Bass a lot: Four times. He's also been four times to the seat of Leichhardt in far north Queensland, which is held by wily old croc farmer Warren Entsch, an arrangement Mr Albanese would cordially like to terminate. There were some places, however, Morrison did not go. Basically, any area with a concentration of Carla Zampatti stores is trouble for the PM; the daughter of the late fashion designer and Liberal scion is running against Dave Sharma in the nation's richest seat — Wentworth — and the ""teal rot"" has spread across wealthy Liberal electorates in a way that is very worrying for Liberal HQ. Part-funded by billionaire Simon Holmes a Court, these ""teal"" candidates bring a new and hectic edge to what was already going to be a pretty exciting election broadcast tomorrow night. What else happened? Oh — Anthony Albanese got COVID and sat things out for a week, just long enough for everyone to note how articulate his stand-ins were. Awkward. Morrison wished the Labor leader well, and compounded his existing reputation for graciousness by observing that on balance, he had done more and achieved more when he himself had COVID, not that it mattered or anything, just saying. Tanya Plibersek, the woman everyone assumes is still deputy Labor leader until reminded that actually she isn't any more, played an unusually low-key role in the Labor campaign. I mean, she didn't operate with Tudge-degree obscuredness, but you'd think — wouldn't you — that in a campaign marked significantly by the incumbent PM's strained relationship with women, the challenger would be wearing his articulate, popular status-of-women spokeswoman like a gardenia in his lapel? Another mystery for the collection. Towards the end of the campaign, some actual issues semi-accidentally emerged. Albanese promised to back an increase to the minimum wage sufficient to overcome inflation. His colleagues sort of walked it back a bit, then walked back the walking back; the thing was like a colicky horse after a few days of this carry-on, but the final uneasy position seems to be that Labor supports pay rises for low-paid workers, and so does Morrison, except Morrison reserves the right to oppose Albanese's way of procuring said pay rises because his way would be inflationary. Nice and clear, all round. Neither man's method, by the way, would either be as expensive OR as inflationary as the $20 billion worth of tax cuts for the rich to which both have cheerily committed, and are due in 2024. They just haven't been discussed much during this campaign, possibly because at a certain wealth point, it becomes rude to talk about money. Morrison's campaign launch, late in the piece, advanced the proposal to let people crack open their super to buy their first house. For the government, this policy has many advantages; it's simple, easy to explain, superficially attractive to people who want to buy a house, and sends a bat right up Paul Keating's nightie. The other late-breaking campaign development, in some personal news, was Morrison's self-identification as a bulldozer. After a few tremulous days in which fascinated interviewers explored what this meant for Morrison, and whether he would or could change, Morrison reclaimed Bulldozer Pride and by Wednesday was happily flattening primary school kids in Devonport. Really, you wouldn't be dead for quids, would you? Even the COVID-afflicted can now vote, thanks to some late rearrangements by the good folk at the Australian Electoral Commission. Which is good news for Pauline Hanson, who tested positive earlier this week and now presumably will watch election night from an Ivermectin float tank in an undisclosed location. Go forth and vote! Vote once! Vote wisely! Remember in the House of Reps you need to number all the boxes! And that's all from me. See you at 6pm tomorrow, on ABC TV. Bring snacks.

106,Solomon Islands Opposition Leader accuses AFP of renting property from government MP for inflated price,politics,"  Solomon Islands Opposition Leader accuses AFP of renting property from government MP for inflated price The Australian Federal Police has become engulfed in a political furore in Solomon Islands after the country's Opposition Leader accused it of renting a property from a key government MP and powerbroker for a hugely inflated price. However, the allegation has been forcefully rejected by the AFP and the Solomon Islands government. On Thursday, the Democratic Party's leader, Matthew Wale, put out a press release alleging that the AFP had rented a ""beachfront property"" owned by Namson Tran, a close ally of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, for just over $35,000 a month. ""The AFP's deal with this Solomon Islands government politician raises a lot of questions surrounding their independence and … is likely to undermine the public's perception of their work in Honiara,"" Mr Wale said. He also alleged that it was ""ethically not right for AFP, or any foreign police force for that matter, to undertake business deals with any Solomon Islands politician"". ""The AFP should clarify their business deals with [Mr] Tran on this property as it clearly jeopardises AFP's mission here in Solomon Islands. If AFP is striking deals with government MPs, then it surely compromises their work here,"" he said. The ABC has asked Mr Wale's office to provide documentation supporting the allegation but they declined. A statement from the Solomon Islands government on behalf of Mr Tran rejected Mr Wale's allegation as ""full of concocted lies"". The statement said the AFP had approached Mr Tran last year and leased the property for what it said was a market rate of $SBD26,000 ($4,528) per month. ""The lease agreement was signed where a monthly Withholding Tax of 10 per cent of $SBD26,000 is paid monthly to the Solomon Islands Government,"" it said. The AFP confirmed to the ABC that it had leased a block of land in Honiara ""to support ongoing operational requirements"", although it did not provide further details. However, it denied any wrongdoing or paying an inflated price for the rental property. ""Any suggestion the AFP has not acted with integrity in this matter is categorically false,"" an AFP spokesperson said in a statement. That statement did not say how much it paid for the land, saying it was ""limited in what further information it can provide, due to commercial-in-confidence issues"". The episode is another demonstration of how strained Australia's ties are with major players on both sides of the political divide in Solomon Islands right now. Mr Wale has been a fierce critic of Mr Sogavare's move to sign a security pact with China, which has stirred great anxiety in Australia. However, he has also accused the Australian government of ignoring warnings that he gave last year about the prospect of China and Solomon Islands strengthening security ties. That drew a strong reaction from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), which took the rare step of issuing a statement directly rejecting Mr Wale's account, and insisting the Opposition Leader had never directly raised the subject with the department. The China-Solomon Islands security pact is likely to hit the headlines again next week, with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi expected to visit Honiara on the first leg of his trip through the Pacific.

108,Prominent Aboriginal elder joins Northern Territory's dismal homeless statistics,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Outside her mother's funeral this week, prominent Larrakia elder June Mills Gudbiling anointed family and community leaders with white ochre she had collected and ground up that morning. They were honouring her mother, Kathy Mills OAM, a leader and activist in the Aboriginal community. After the service, June Mills had nowhere to go but back to but her car. ""I'm homeless. I am able to stay here and there with family now and again, but pretty much I'm living in the car,"" she said. June Mills Gudbiling is well known in Darwin for performing Welcome to Country ceremonies, teaching children traditional stories and language, advocating for better approaches to youth justice and tackling climate change. She does much of this work for free while living on welfare. The pandemic has exposed generations of neglect in the funding of remote housing for Aboriginal Australians. In the Northern Territory, families still hold on to hope their children will see a better future. Now she's been evicted from public housing in Darwin's northern suburbs, and said she cannot afford anywhere to live. ""Its really embarrassing. It's hurtful and, at the moment, I'm just living with it. I'm like, 'Well, it is what it is',"" she said. Ms Mills Gudbiling admits she was a messy public housing tenant. She was told by NT Housing that she no longer qualified for a three-bedroom house because she has only one son still living with her. They rejected the offer of a singles flat for both of them, because it only had one bedroom. ""In the end, they came to say it was about fire, that a power cord was a fire hazard,"" she said. ""But they kept changing the story: It was because I had an unregistered car … there was long grass that needed mowing … it was messy."" NT Housing would not comment on Ms Mills Gudbiling's case but said anyone who has had their tenancy terminated for a variety of reasons cannot apply for public housing again in the territory for two years. The chief executive of the NT Shelter housing advocacy group, Peter McMillan, is calling on the territory government to work harder on avoiding evictions in the jurisdiction that already has the worst homeless statistics in the country. ""In the NT, we have one in 20 people who are homeless. That corresponds with one in 200 people who are homeless across Australia,"" he said. ""So, we have such a significant housing shortage, and an increase in the number of people who are either homeless, or at risk of homelessness, is the last thing that we can really afford to see."" NT Shelter is also appealing to both levels of government to commit more resources to easing the housing squeeze in Indigenous communities, public housing and the private rental market. Mr McMillan said having somewhere to live should be considered a human right. ""In Commonwealth legislation, it's recognised as a human need but it's not recognised as a human right in any of our states and territories,"" he said. ""Back in 1948, there was a charter on human rights agreed at the United Nations, Article 25, which makes it very clear people have a right to housing. When Cherylene Campbell and her sons finally got a home with disability access, they thought it was a dream come true — until they were evicted. ""We should have that. Countries like France and Scotland and others have agreed to that and, in their case, they've been able to give commitments that anyone who is evicted from last-resort housing, that should only happen when there's an exit plan. ""And when tenancies are starting to get into difficulty, that's where support agencies should be coming in to work with government, to work on their difficult tenants, and get things back on track before they get out of whack."" Indigenous people make up 30 per cent of the Northern Territory's population, but 88 per cent of them are homeless. Northern Territory's public housing waitlist ranges from two to eight years, and evictions have risen from one in the past four years to eight so far this year. Some were not because of the tenant's fault. Aboriginal health worker Simon Johnston can't understand why he has been evicted, along with seven children, from Indigenous public housing in Tennant Creek. ""It makes you angry because kids are involved and there's four kids under five and nowhere else to go with them,"" he said. The organisation managing the house, Julalikari, told the ABC there were no complaints about the family. However, it said, Mr Johnston was only ever given the property as temporary accommodation, and the NT government has asked for the house back to provide youth programs. Mr Johnston has had to split up his family and bring them to relatives in Alice Springs and Groote Eylandt. He said he cannot find a private rental in Tennant Creek at the $400 a week he was paying for the public house. ""There's a lot of people in Tennant Creek looking for houses but can't find any, and the prices are pretty expensive,"" he said. ""But, being on my own now, I can go and live in a tent. ""There are lots of people sleeping in tents on the edge of Tennant now."" In the Northern Territory public houses are sitting unoccupied for months on end. Mr Johnston said he and other Tennant Creek residents have been frustrated hearing the Northern Territory and federal politicians promise to provide more Indigenous public houses in Tennant Creek. The Northern Territory government said it built 10 Indigenous town camp houses there last year, after several years of no new houses being provided. It has promised that, in Tennant Creek and surrounding remote communities, 141 new houses are coming, although it hasn't said by when. Mr Johnston remains sceptical. ""People aren't taking notice anymore of these promises, because we are used to those kind of words being spread and then nothing being delivered,"" he said. The territory's new Chief Minister, Natasha Fyles, says her government will speed up its plan to provide more Aboriginal public housing. ""We have got on with that job but it takes time,"" she said. ""But it is an absolute focus for us and, so, we have got a range of programs, and we will be out there delivering those houses."" Mr McMillian estimates the territory is currently 9,000 public and affordable houses short, and this is expected to rise to 15,000 within 15 years. ""In the Northern Territory, we receive 1 per cent of [federal government] funding for homelessness, despite having 11 per cent of the population [homeless], so we get $20 million, compared to $170 million that Western Australia gets for far fewer homeless people,"" he said. ""So we're calling that a $167-million-a-year rip-off for the Northern Territory."" As June Mills Gudbiling walked back to her car after the funeral, all her remaining belongings were piled up in the back seat. She said she feels unable to ask her kids, who have their own big families, if she can stay. ""I haven't humbugged anybody. I'm trying to sleep anywhere safe I can find. I haven't wanted to burden anybody with my predicament,"" she said.

109,Heavy police presence blamed for shift towards one major party among Western Sydney voters,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes In a Sydney cafe, Izzat Khatib can expertly manoeuvre the delicate handles on a coffee machine to make a full-bodied espresso. It's almost a reflex after 22 years as a cafe owner in the Western Sydney suburb of Bankstown. Over his two decades in business, the father-of-six has experienced the impacts of a changing economy on his small business many times. However, in those years, he had never experienced anything like the COVID-19 lockdowns of 2020 that forced him to shut his doors for more than two months. When he could finally reopen, Mr Khatib and other business owners in the shopping centre had to contend with a newly imposed — and major — police presence, a COVID-19 measure enforced by the state government. He remembers 15 police officers patrolling just outside the cafe doors, and said it was a clear deterrent to takeaway customers. ""As a business, we struggled,"" he said. ""I was sitting here turning over around $80 a day. ""They were questioning why you were coming into the centre. They were quite heavy-handed. It was intimidating. ""It seems to have been more in the west than anywhere else."" It led to a disillusionment with the major parties. Then, one day, he discovered his regular customer, John Koukoulis, was also a member of Clive Palmer's United Australia Party (UAP). Mr Koukoulis is now the UAP candidate in the Sydney seat of Watson, and Mr Khatib is a member of the UAP backing his campaign. A Palestinian Muslim by heritage, Mr Khatib said it was not so much his multicultural background that directed him towards the party, but rather his experience as a small business owner in the working-class suburb during COVID-19. ""Definitely the biggest thing was [UAP's] no lockdown [policy],"" he said. Clive Palmer says he plans to spend about $70 million on the coming federal election campaign. Here's how the massive campaign budget could influence the federal election. It's almost a protest vote, and he feels other major and minor parties have little to offer him. ""Sometimes in life we need a change. So it's always been Labor-Liberal. I don't think anyone [here] looks at One Nation, obviously,"" he said. ""UAP seems to be more honest actually, you feel that. ""There is a sense [Clive Palmer] is my next door neighbour, he is my friend."" Mr Khatib said that, despite appearances from its larger-than-life founder — Queensland billionaire Clive Palmer, who fronts much of the party's advertising — the UAP was a very multicultural party. ""It's the most multicultural you'll ever see … It's all walks of life,"" he said. The UAP's support among multicultural groups is being noted anecdotally by observers as one of the unexpected trends to emerge during the 2022 election campaign. An uptick in support has also been seen in focus groups of UAP voters conducted by RedBridge, a political consultancy that has worked with Labor, minor parties and independent candidates. ""We get a very … culturally diverse representation,"" RedBridge's Simon Welsh said. Do you know more about this story? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au One of the issues that comes up frequently is resentment over lockdowns. ""It's certainly feeding into it. And that experience is being replicated in our research, in terms of when we do focus groups with UAP voters,"" he said. Mr Khatib said that, among the Muslims he knows, ""there's a lot of talk going around about the UAP"". Adel Salman from the Islamic Council of Victoria was not surprised. He said harsh lockdowns in Western Sydney were viewed by many to be targeting Muslim areas, and long lockdowns in Melbourne had also built up a reservoir of resentment. ""When you have a populist party talking against that and talking about freedom of the individual and freedom from lockdowns, etc., I'm not that surprised that … there may be some people within the Muslim community who would actually be supportive,"" he said. Mr Salman said the UAP might perform better than expected in areas such as Western Sydney and Melbourne's outer suburbs, but ""that would still be … a minimal number of votes"" overall. The Islamic Council of Victoria ran a survey of Muslim Australian voters this month. Lockdowns did not emerge as a leading issue. ""[It] didn't register as one of the top concerns, but other areas did: Religious discrimination, Islamophobia … [have] come up quite often,"" he said. Mr Koukoulis himself is from a Greek background and is chief executive of registered training organisation Ransford College. He said the UAP appealed to a diverse group of people. ""We've got young people. We have Muslims, non-Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists,"" he said. ""They know that I relate to them and they relate to me and I'm their voice."" However, it remains to be seen whether these anecdotal trends will play out in the numbers once ballots are counted. Watson is held by long-time Labor MP Tony Burke, with a margin of more than 17 per cent, and is considered a very safe Labor seat. At the 2019 election there was a 3.7 per cent swing away from Labor and the UAP picked up 4.2 per cent of the vote, or about 3,500 votes. Polls suggest that UAP will have support from about 4 per cent of the electorate, including in Watson, but some analysts believe the party's support could be underestimated by polling to date. ""Certainly the vote looks [to be] going up,"" Mr Welsh said. He said RedBridge's research suggested the stigma of admitting to be a UAP supporter was fading fast. But it's still not easy for pollsters to reach UAP voters. ""They're just very difficult people to get into the research process,"" he said. ""They're difficult to get on the phone. It's difficult to get them to answer a poll because, [for] so many of them, the core problem is that they don't feel like the political system responds to them."" Mr Koukoulis is sending his preferences in the lower house to One Nation and then the Coalition, with Labor and then The Greens last. Elsewhere, Watson voter Diane Yammine has also signed up to the UAP. The mother-of-three said she felt the two major parties were not offering anything new and was particularly attracted to UAP's policy of capping housing interest rates at 3 per cent. A cap on mortgage repayments would come as welcome relief for millions of borrowers. But can it be done and who would end up paying for it? ""I love UAP policies on interest rates and freedom of religion,"" she said. ""They're not just sort of sticking to policies that don't work. ""They're looking outside the square."" She, too, was unhappy with the NSW Liberal-National state government's handling of COVID-19 lockdowns. ""There was just a lot of forcefulness going on and our voice was taken away, and a lot of control,"" she said. ""It just made me want to see what else is out there."" Coming from a Lebanese Christian background Ms Yammine said she did not view the UAP as a homogenous party, the way some might. ""It's definitely multicultural. It's very diverse,"" she said. While the UAP's chances are rated as low by the experts, Mr Khatib will be watching Saturday's election result closely. ""Will they win? I hope so. I reckon they might give it a very good shake.""

110,Fee-for-flattery: WeChat publisher offers candidates a positive spin. But there's a price to be paid,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes A mysterious media agency is behind a fee-for-service offering to federal election candidates, including Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, placement of favourable news articles and interviews on the Chinese-language social media platform WeChat. Australian Financial News (AFN) has published more than 131 advertisements and articles related to the federal election since January, according to researchers from Deakin and Monash universities who are monitoring election material on Chinese social media. Some of this content is presented as news articles written by independent journalists. The ABC has discovered a proposal from AFN for a political candidate that offers, for a fixed price, six weeks of ads, as well as a video and article on WeChat. AFN has helped at least five political campaigns from across the political spectrum advertise to Australia's Chinese-speaking community via WeChat, which boasts more than 1.2 billion active users, many of whom are among the 1.2 million Chinese Australian voters who will cast their ballot on Saturday. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Labor leader Anthony Albanese, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher, and North Sydney candidates Catherine Renshaw for Labor and independent candidate Kylea Tink, have all been featured in advertisements on AFN's WeChat channel. Mr Frydenberg — who is in a life-or-death struggle in the inner-city Melbourne seat of Kooyong against independent candidate Monique Ryan — has paid for advertisements on AFN's WeChat Channel. It was Mr Frydenberg's campaign that featured most prominently on the AFN channel, with more than a quarter of all AFN election content — including ads, advertorials and commentary — since January 6 containing at least one reference to the Treasurer. When pitching to prospective clients, AFN also sent examples of the WeChat advertisements they had published on behalf of Mr Frydenberg to prospective political clients. ""There are banner advertisements with the Australian Financial News promoting the Morrison government's economic record and plan for a stronger future,"" a spokesperson for Mr Frydenberg said. ""Information on Anthony Albanese's record of supporting higher taxes on Australians has also been featured through banner advertising. WeChat researcher Robbie Fordyce from Monash University also noted there had been a marked increase in the number of advertisements and positive editorial content about Mr Frydenberg from April 2022 onwards. He said ""this level of coverage"" would typically only be available to paid clients. While the Treasurer's office acknowledged that it had placed authorised campaign advertisements on AFN, it denied paying the company to publish flattering editorial coverage. ""There is no payment for articles,"" Frydenberg's spokesperson said. Though AFN has been a prominent player on WeChat during the election campaign, it maintains an elusive business presence. Its listed business address in the Barangaroo precinct of inner Sydney was empty when the ABC visited last week. Its phone number was also no longer connected to the business. Its director, Han Guoliang, was also previously a director of, and shareholder in, Chinese-Australian media outlet Sydney Today. In 2020, AFN apologised for publishing ""false allegations"" about an Australian funds manager. A 2021 AFN press kit, it refers to itself as an ""AFN think tank"" which lists economist and former Labor Party trade minister Craig Emerson as a member. Mr Emerson says he's never heard of AFN. ""I'm unfamiliar with this organisation, and don't have any recollection of having been involved in any of their dealings,"" he told the ABC. ""It appears the description of me is straight from my website."" The press kit also listed a series of companies and Australian government departments as their ""cooperative partners"". The list includes organisations such as business news and data provider Bloomberg, two of Australia's largest consulting firms, PWC and KPMG, and Victorian government agency Invest Victoria. Of those that responded to the ABC, all denied having any current connection with AFN. Invest Victoria said it had ""no record of any relationship or partnership with Australian Financial News"". Fan Yang from Deakin University — who is part of a research group that examined more than 3,200 election-related advertisements and articles on WeChat from 134 public accounts since May 2021 — says companies such as AFN operate as a fee-for-service business while maintaining the appearance of a news organisation. ""They're somewhere between the media and a business,"" she said. The research team found that AFN was one of the most-prolific publishers on WeChat of federal election-related content, and published more advertisements and articles about Mr Frydenberg than any other of the public accounts they monitored. ""In the last week, we have seen several cases with two articles a day from AFN with references to [Mr] Frydenberg,"" said Monash University's Dr Fordyce. Ms Yang and her colleagues also found that, across all 134 WeChat accounts they monitored for election content, 7.7 per cent included some mention of Mr Frydenberg, whether in an article's text or as an advertisement appended to a report. Mr Frydenberg's campaign also appeared to have provided AFN, and another WeChat channel, with original materials that would later appear in effusive articles. Eddie Chan, who runs a Melbourne dry cleaning business, was featured in a video and two articles on WeChat, praising the federal Treasurer. Mr Chan told the ABC the glowing video interview was arranged after he personally offered to help Mr Frydenberg in his re-election efforts. He said Mr Frydenberg arranged for his campaign team to film Mr Chan in his shop. The footage later appeared on AFN's WeChat channel. Mr Chan was happy to appear in the promotional material, saying it reflected his genuine view of Mr Frydenberg. ""Josh puts people together. He has a strong local connection,"" Mr Chan said. Independent candidate for North Sydney Kylea Tink has also run advertisements and an interview article has appeared on WeChat via AFN. Her campaign told the ABC the company provided a tailored proposal for several advertisements, an interview and a translated video that would run over six weeks. The advertisements, video and article were a package deal. In the headline story featuring Ms Tink, AFN wrote that the candidate ""understood the importance of seeking common ground while reserving differences"". ""Participating in public welfare affairs has made her more aware of the current social situation and public sentiment in Australia,"" the article said. At the bottom of the paid interview with Ms Tink, a disclaimer states the article is an ""election promotion"" article. An AFN article published on WeChat about Labor's candidate for North Sydney, Catherine Renshaw, includes the following authorisation: ""The above information is authorised by Bob Nanva of the Australian Labor Party (NSW). Level 9, 377 Sussex Street Sydney NSW 2000."" Under Australian electoral laws, content considered to be ""electoral communications"" typically requires an authorisation to ensure transparency, accountability and traceability. There is no such disclaimer or authorisation in the articles about Mr Frydenberg. Asked about the lack of a proper authorisation, Ms Tink's campaign said they would inform the publisher and ask them to add one. The AEC and Professor Renshaw have been contacted for comment, but neither responded by publication time. AFN's articles about Mr Frydenberg are almost universally flattering and, in some cases, appear lifted from other news outlets. One of the AFN stories, published in mid-February, was titled ""The next Australian Prime Minister is about to be decided?"" It describes Mr Frydenberg's life story, and appears to be paraphrasing positive sections of previous media reporting about the Liberal candidate from other outlets, including The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian. The article claims Prime Minister Scott Morrison was being abandoned by voters for leaving for Hawaii during the Black Summer bushfires and for attending football matches during the pandemic. ""Voters are running away in droves,"" the article said. ""If the Coalition hopes to return to power, it cannot rule out a new leader, and the current treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, would be a favourite."" Inside the Canberra bubble, ""drops"" are a well-known media management tactic used by politicians of all stripes — more often by the government of the day and especially in the run-up to an election. The glowing article then dives into how Mr Frydenberg's love for tennis has shaped him into a capable leader before explaining how his Jewish heritage made the ideal replacement for the country's top job. That story was read more than 25,000 times since it was published, among voters with Chinese backgrounds. AFN did not respond to ABC questions about whether Mr Frydenberg's office had reviewed or approved the articles before publication. However, the story was taken down after being contacted by the ABC. The Treasurer is facing off against independent candidate Monique Ryan in the Victorian electorate of Kooyong where, according to 2016 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), one-in-nine residents report having Chinese ancestry. He has faced backlash from Chinese-Australian voters over the Coalition's anti-China rhetoric. AFN and Labor did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.

111,New Northern Territory cabinet minister follows in the trailblazing footsteps of her father,politics,"  Member for Karama Ngaree Ah Kit named as Northern Territory government's new cabinet minister The daughter of a trailblazing politician is set to follow in her father's footsteps, with Ngaree Ah Kit joining the Northern Territory government frontbench. Ms Ah Kit, the member for the Darwin northern suburbs seat of Karama, will enter the Territory cabinet after serving as the parliament's speaker since 2020. ""It is an honour to be selected by my peers to be the next minister of the 14th legislative assembly,"" Ms Ah Kit said in a statement on Friday morning. ""I am looking forward to my new role and will embrace portfolios and duties required of me."" Ms Ah Kit's father was the late John 'Jak' Ah Kit – a former NT government minister who spent a decade in parliament. He was the Territory's first Aboriginal minister, who during his long and colourful career was known as a fighter and advocate for Indigenous Territorians. Towards the end of his life, Mr Ah Kit was also the CEO of the Northern Land Council. He passed away in 2020, aged 69. ""I'm proud to acknowledge my dad's legacy that he left serving Territorians for 10 years, and I look forward to creating my own,"" Ms Ah Kit said today. ""I thank my constituents and look forward to representing them and all Territorians."" Ms Ah Kit hails from the Territory, and from Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and Chinese heritage. She replaced former NT Labor leader Delia Lawrie as the member for Karama in 2016. The position in cabinet was freed up after Natasha Fyles replaced Michael Gunner as chief minister last week. In the statement released today, Ms Fyles pledged that her team remained ""united and stable"" following Ms Ah Kit's promotion. The government did not step forward for a press conference following the announcement. The news ends days of speculation over who would take the role, with acting deputy speaker and former AFL player Joel Bowden also considered to be in contention.

112,More than 200 West Australians with COVID have now died this year as cases continue to swell,politics," Coronavirus More than 200 West Australians have now died with COVID-19 this year, as the state continues to grapple with surging cases. WA has recorded another 15,205 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of active infections to 89,895. Of those, 304 are in hospital, including 11 in intensive care. Another five deaths have been recorded, bringing the total number of COVID-related fatalities in WA this year to 203. With the number of people stuck in isolation with COVID-19 continuing to climb, Premier Mark McGowan said ""way more"" than 3,000 health staff were currently furloughed because of the virus. He said in the ambulance service, about 40 per cent of staff were absent because of COVID. It means St John Ambulance will be running 15 per cent fewer ambulances than usual during the day today, with 69 vehicles on the road rather than 82. Premier Mark McGowan says WA's ambulance service could have asked the Department of Fire and Emergency Services for help on the night Georgina Wild died. ""I don't think there's any avoiding the fact that that is a difficult situation for any workforce to manage,"" Mr McGowan said. ""It's occurring more so among our health workforce because of the people they work with, and also because of the fact that many of them have kids at school who become COVID-positive who then bring it home."" But he said the government was doing everything it could to manage the situation, including by placing health and police staff in St John's control room and preparing firefighters to drive ambulances. After a parliamentary inquiry into WA's ambulance service tabled its findings yesterday, Mr McGowan today committed to not bringing the service into the public sector. One of the inquiry's 48 recommendations was that St John Ambulance be given five years to improve its service, before considering a new provider or for the government to take control. The Premier said he thought that recommendation was ""reasonable"". ""Frankly I don't think it will occur, that it would come back in-house,"" he said. ""But monitoring and making sure there's better performance, I think, is a really, really good thing to do."" The Australian Medical Association's WA president, Mark Duncan-Smith said he was pleased and surprised by that outcome. ""I think that they suggested to continue with the St John's contract because if they didn't do that at the moment, it would have brought too much pressure to bear and too much light on the lack of capacity that the McGowan government has created in the hospital system due to neglect over the last five years,"" he said. When asked about ambulance ramping, Mr McGowan seemed to point the finger partially at GPs. While many in Western Australia are enjoying new freedoms, some in the community are choosing to stay home. He said doctors were pushing patients toward hospital emergency departments by putting up signs asking people with respiratory illnesses not to come in. ""I would request that GPs don't do that. I'd just ask, don't do that,"" he said. ""Isn't the Hippocratic Oath that you're supposed to allow anyone to come in and receive medical attention? ""So I'd just ask our GPs across the state, if people are unwell, please deal with them. Referring them to our emergency departments just puts additional pressure onto our hospitals."" The President of the Royal Australian College of GPs, Karen Price, was critical of Mr McGowan's comments, saying they showed a lack of understanding. ""Some general practices are not big enough to actually see respiratory patients,"" she said. ""If a doctor or their staff becomes unwell with COVID then the whole clinic has to often shut down if it's a small clinic, and this is particularly relevant for rural and remote regions. ""Given that GPs have done 117 million or so services in the last year, I think it's cheeky to say that GPs have not been lifting their weight."" Professor Price said GPs needed more support, and that governments of all levels needed to come together to find a way to provide that help. Dr Duncan-Smith also leapt to the defence of GPs.""GPs out in the community are doing a great job. GPs are keeping people out of hospital,"" he said. ""This is another attempt to use another scapegoat to blame for the McGowan [government's] lack of investment in capacity of the hospital system over the last five years."" Opposition Leader Mia Davies said the Premier should not be trying to blame others for issues in the health system. ""This Premier needs to accept that under his watch, for the last five years, this government has overseen a crumbling health system. They have underinvested and they are now trying to spend their way out of a crisis,"" she said. ""He needs to concentrate on repairing the health system instead of deflecting to other organisations."" May looks set to be the worst month this year for ambulance ramping, with paramedics so far spending an average of 189 hours a day parked outside hospitals waiting to transfer patients. That is higher than the daily rate recorded in March, when WA recorded its previous peak in ramped hours for the year. It comes as the government made a last-minute change to the state's COVID rules ahead of tomorrow's election. Signed by Acting Police Commissioner Col Blanch yesterday morning, the directions mean asymptomatic close contacts, who would otherwise have to stay in isolation, will be allowed out to vote. That's provided they wear a mask, return a negative rapid antigen test in the two hours before leaving isolation and go straight to and from their nearest polling place. At the last count, about 24 per cent of West Australian voters had cast their ballot early. And while the Australian Electoral Commission had been worried it would not have enough staff to operate some polling booths in WA, it said in a statement on Friday afternoon that all positions had been filled. But Commissioner Tom Rogers warned that was not the end of the issue. ""If some of the small number of people we've lined up to work at a local voting centre withdraw on the morning of the election, we may not have back ups available in that town,"" he said. ""To those people working for us tomorrow, thank you for putting your hand up. Please, unless you wake up COVID-positive, come in to work to make sure that your polling place can open. ""To voters, if there is a queue, remember to treat our staff with kindness. You wouldn't have a local polling place with them."" Some WA businesses claim they may be forced to close their doors due to staffing shortages, with cases expected to peak at 25,000 in the coming weeks. Bespoke by Barista HQ cafe in Victoria Park has faced extreme staffing pressures due to staff either contracting the virus or having to isolate. Owner Maureen Chandwani said despite being located on one of Perth's busiest cafe and retail strips, her business was struggling to survive. ""I think nearly 70 per cent of our staff at different times have been affected by COVID,"" she said. ""So we've had a stretch where for 14 days, we did not have staff members on the job and we didn't know how to sustain the business."" Ms Chandwani and her husband have owned the cafe and barista training centre for nearly four years and usually have 15 workers on the floor. ""On Mother's Day we did not advertise at all, [because] we didn't even know if we were going to be open or not,"" she said. ""We had no chef in the kitchen because he got COVID, we had no baristas because they got COVID. So it was just basically my husband and myself. ""Even on the weekends where we are really busy, people are waiting for their food for like 40 to 45 minutes, and that's become normal now."" Ms Chandwani said the situation had left her ""emotionally stressed and drained"", knowing she may have no other option but to shut the doors. ""It's very, very hard at the moment to sustain the business, to be able to pay the rent, to be able to pay the wages, because the numbers have dropped a lot,"" she said. ""There are government grants and stuff like that, but they're just not enough to cover all the cost. We're just trying to hold the fort and somehow move on."" Other businesses in the area have also told similar tales, with Indian restaurant Colaba Social delaying its opening by a couple of months due to understaffing. ""It's picking up now since we opened and the restrictions have come down but before that, we were struggling to find the staff,"" chef Shyam Verma said. ""Sometimes staff get COVID and then sometimes three or four people have to isolate, which has really affected us on the busy nights as well [because] we can't provide the good customer service. ""It's very hard when we're really short of staff and everybody has like a lot of other commitments back home, like I have a family with kids so I can't be working many long hours.""

113,Here's how to vote if you're one of the thousands of Australians stuck in COVID-19 isolation for election day,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes A last-minute change to voting rules has been made so people who have tested positive to COVID-19 will be able to vote over the phone this election. It includes people who have tested positive since last Friday night and means more people will be eligible to vote over the phone. But how exactly does it all work? Originally, the rules said only people who tested positive for COVID-19 after Tuesday night (May 17) and would be in isolation for polling day on Saturday May 21 would be able to use the phone system. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. After an uproar — including threats of a legal challenge — the Australian Electoral Commission recommended on Friday morning that phone voting should be extended to those who have tested positive since last Friday (May 13) at 6pm, in cases where they have not voted early or applied for a postal vote. The federal government accepted the recommendation shortly after it was made. Voters who are blind or have low vision will also be able to vote over the phone, and have been able to register for the service since May 9. Close contacts without symptoms cannot use the phone service, because they are able to vote in person. Yes. If you need to vote this way, you will need to register first. You can register online on the Australian Electoral Commission's website, and will need to provide proof that you have tested positive to COVID-19 after the deadline last Friday. Details of a positive RAT or PCR test, including a reference number and serial number if available, will need to be provided. Voters will need to confirm their details on the electoral roll, complete a questionnaire and choose a PIN before receiving a telephone voting registration number by SMS or email. After registering and receiving the number, electors can call in to vote until 6pm on Friday, or between 8am and 6pm on Saturday. The Australian Electoral Commission has strongly urged people to prepare before calling to vote by checking relevant ballot papers and deciding preferences first, saying phone voting is an emergency measure. The commission has warned there could be long waits because its staff need to follow a process to keep votes secure, which could take a while — especially if voters are not well prepared. By using a registration number, votes remain secret because the assistant at the other end of the line will not know the voter's name or address. The assistant will record the vote onto hard-copy ballot papers, read it back, transfer them into an envelope and place them into a secure ballot box.

114,We fact checked Scott Morrison on the Coalition's federal integrity commission. Here's what we found,politics," Fact Check Scott Morrison says the government's proposed integrity commission would have the powers of a royal commission. Is that correct? Under attack from Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese during the third leaders' debate on the Seven Network, Prime Minister Scott Morrison defended his government's proposed bill to establish a federal integrity commission. ""The bill has powers of search, it has powers compelling witnesses. It has powers of a royal commission,"" Mr Morrison said. Is that correct? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. Mr Morrison is cherrypicking. Experts told Fact Check there were indeed similarities between the coercive powers of a royal commission and the government's proposed model for a federal anti-corruption commission. For example, as referenced by Mr Morrison, the powers of search and the ability to compel witnesses to appear before the commission are comparable. Other similarities include powers to require people to surrender documents and other evidence, the ability to apply for telecommunication intercepts, and the power to have individuals arrested or passports confiscated. However, by highlighting the similarities between the respective bodies, Mr Morrison's claim obscures important and fundamental differences. The Royal Commissions Act is relatively brief, leaving scope for commissioners to use their powers broadly. In contrast, the much longer Commonwealth Integrity Commission bill imposes many constraints, including how investigations can be initiated and carried out. In particular, there are significant differences in powers in the proposed ""public sector division"", covering most of the public service, parliamentarians, higher education providers and research bodies — estimated to be 80 per cent of the proposed commission's remit. In this division, unlike a royal commission, the CIC would lack the power to hold public hearings. There are also differences in this division on what types of conduct can be investigated, who can be investigated and how much of its work can be reported publicly, in contrast to royal commissions. Experts told Fact Check that these restrictions undercut the new body's powers in a way that did not apply to royal commissions. They also pointed out that the CIC would have less ability than a royal commission to exercise the powers it did have, because its proposed annual budget fell well below the cost of many single-issue royal commissions. Fact Check has previously tested a similar claim from Social Services Minister Anne Ruston. Social Services Minister Anne Ruston says the government's model for a federal integrity commission has powers ""well in excess"" of a royal commission. Is that correct? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. In November 2021, Senator Ruston said: ""Our particular bill suggests that the powers of the commission are well in excess of a royal commission."" Fact Check found that claim to be overblown, based on expert interpretation of the government's exposure draft legislation released in November 2020. At the time, other Coalition politicians had made similar versions of the same claim. Comparing the CIC with royal commissions appears to have first been raised by then attorney-general Christian Porter in November 2020. In a media release announcing the draft legislation, Mr Porter said the CIC would have""greater investigatory powers than a Royal Commission"". The same assertion of ""greater investigatory"" powers can also be found in a statement on the Attorney-General's Department website. Much like Senator Ruston, Liberal backbencher Jason Falinski wrote on Facebook the CIC would have ""stronger powers than a royal commission"", while fellow backbencher Dave Sharma claimed the CIC draft legislation had ""powers akin to a royal commission"". Mr Morrison's claim comes closer to that of Mr Sharma, in that he did not claim that the powers of the government's proposed model for an integrity commission would be greater, and did not mention ""investigative powers"". As set out in Fact Check's analysis of Senator Ruston's claim, the Australian Law Reform Commission explains that a royal commission is an inquiry established by a government ""usually to ascertain factual circumstances and make recommendations"". The Royal Commissions Act 1902 establishes powers for the Governor-General to commission a person or persons to investigate into and report on any particular issue that relates to or is connected with ""the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth, or any public purpose or any power of the Commonwealth"". As established in an earlier fact check, royal commissions have in recent times been established to inquire into suspected wrongdoings, but in the past have also been set up for experts to propose solutions to policy problems. The ALRC notes that: ""Royal commissions occupy a unique place in the Australian system of government, being the highest form of inquiry on matters of public importance."" The ALRC explains that a federal royal commission has coercive information-gathering powers including the ability to summon a witness to give evidence or produce documents. The Royal Commissions Act creates a number of statutory offences for failure to comply. Is there ""nothing that ASIC can't do that a royal commission can do"" as Scott Morrison suggests? ABC Fact Check investigates. However, penalties such as fines and imprisonment are imposed by a court and not the royal commission itself. The ALRC quoted from a 1954 High Court decision: ""The commission can neither decide nor determine anything and nothing that it does can in any way affect the legal position of any person. Its powers and functions are not judicial."" The parameters of a royal commission's investigation are typically broad and established via its terms of reference. Hearings are normally held in public and its findings are published in the form of a report. According to the statement on the Attorney-General's Department website, the Commonwealth Integrity Commission was proposed ""to strengthen integrity arrangements across the federal public sector"". ""The CIC would be a centralised, specialist centre for the prevention and investigation of corruption in the Commonwealth public sector and higher education and research sectors,"" a departmental explanatory document reads. ""The CIC would be established as a new independent statutory agency, subsuming and replacing the existing Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity."" As noted, in November 2020, Mr Porter released draft legislation outlining the government's proposal for the CIC. Under the government's proposal, the CIC would be split into two divisions. The ""law enforcement integrity division"" would have jurisdiction over certain federal law enforcement agencies, such as the federal police, as well as public sector agencies with investigative functions, like the Department of Home Affairs. The ""public sector integrity division"" would investigate parliamentarians, the public service, higher education providers and other Commonwealth entities. Using ABS data and other government reports, researchers at Transparency International Australia, a not-for-profit anti-corruption research and advocacy organisation, calculated the law enforcement division would account for approximately 20 per cent of its remit with the remaining 80 per cent falling into the public sector division. Law enforcement division Public sector division Source: Attorney-General's Department The department's fact sheet says in relation to each division that the commission can investigate ""conduct that involves an abuse of office or perversion of the course of justice"". Beyond that, there are differences. The public sector division can only investigate these matters ""where this conduct would also constitute one of a list of corruption-related offences against a law of the Commonwealth."" The law enforcement division is not subject to this restriction. In addition, it can investigate ""corruption of any other kind… giving priority to serious and systemic corruption"". Referrals in the public division can only be made by certain individuals including the Attorney-General, the responsible minister for the agency investigated, Commonwealth Integrity Office Holders and certain parliamentarians. Investigations in the law enforcement division can be referred by anyone — including members of the public. The powers to hold public hearings and publish findings also differ significantly between the two divisions. Hearings relating to the law enforcement division would be held in public. In contrast, hearings relating to the public sector division, including politicians and their staffers, ""must be held in private"", the government's bill says. The exposure draft refers to various reports by the integrity commissioner. In one case, reports relating to both divisions must include proposed actions or actions taken and any recommendations made by a commissioner. However, only in the law enforcement division can those reports include the Commissioner's findings and the evidence on which those findings are based. The bill also places explicit limitations on public reporting about ""a parliamentarian, the office of a parliamentarian or a staff member of the office of a parliamentarian"". The two divisions have the same rules when it comes to coercive information-gathering powers, with courts able to impose penalties including fines and imprisonment for failure to comply. There are indeed some similarities in the powers vested in a royal commission and in the government's proposed model. Upon the release of the government's consultation draft, both Mr Porter's initial statement and the Attorney-General's website point to six similar examples: hold hearings and compel witnesses to testify enter and search premises require people to surrender documents and other evidence use telecommunication interceptions have individuals arrested confiscate passports Mr Morrison specifically referred to the first two of these examples. Although this is not an exhaustive list of the available powers to the proposed integrity commission, professor of public policy and law at Griffith University and board member of Transparency International Australia AJ Brown previously told Fact Check it served as a useful comparison between the two bodies. Professor Brown said there was no significant difference between the government's model and a royal commission for these two particular powers. This also applied to the ability to require people to surrender documents and other evidence. On the other powers, there are some minor differences. In terms of issuing arrest warrants, Professor Brown said there were some differences with the CIC having a remit to make arrests in relation to offences whereas a royal commission's arrest powers were limited to offences relating to a failure to appear before the commission. But while the CIC has a broader scope in respect to arrests, it is required to apply for warrants via a superior court judge whereas a royal commission has the power to issue a warrant directly, he said. Both the CIC and a royal commission would have the power to order telecommunication intercepts. However, under provisions of the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, the CIC would likely be able to make applications directly to a court whereas a royal commission must first seek approval via the relevant Commonwealth minister (currently the Prime Minister), Professor Brown noted. Similarly, the CIC does have specific provisions to confiscate passports that are not found in the Royal Commissions Act. But in practice, a royal commission would have the ability through its general powers to apply to a court to have a passport confiscated. Senior fellow at the Centre for Independent Studies Scott Prasser, who has written books on royal commissions and was a member of the advisory committee to the Australian Law Reform Commission's review of the Royal Commision Act, also previously told Fact Check that similar coercive powers were available. Experts spoken to by Fact Check for its previous analysis identified some major differences between the government's proposed CIC and a royal commission. Importantly, a royal commission has the power to conduct public hearings. As associate professor and deputy director of the Australian Centre for Justice Innovation at Monash University Yee-Fui Ng observed, the presence of public hearings marks a difference between the Royal Commissions Act and the government's bill.""A royal commission has the power to conduct public hearings, which is a power that the CIC does not have for the public sector division,"" she said. ""The division covering ministers, public servants, advisors — the main part of the public service — does not have that major power."" So why is this an important distinction when comparing the two bodies? Dr Prasser told Fact Check public hearings were fundamental to the function of royal commissions. ""The whole purpose of royal commissions and public enquiries is that they are open, people can see them and they can see the evidence being given,"" he said. He added that royal commissioners had the discretion to hold hearings out of public view in certain circumstances, for example where it was deemed necessary to protect the identity of a witness, but that it was a ""normal expectation they would be held in public"". Furthermore, as Professor Brown argued, public hearings represented an important investigative power of a Royal Commission. ""[A royal commission] is all about gaining evidence by calling people to hearings, but then also exposing that evidence to a public audience which then triggers more evidence from other people,"" Professor Brown said. ""It also influences the truth of evidence people give, for the same reason as when people are called to give evidence in an open court, it influences what they say because they know everybody can hear them. ""There may be other specific powers of compulsion or discovery which the CIC would have under the legislation, which the Royal Commissions Act doesn't include, but these fade into insignificance compared to the power to call evidence in public hearings."" In all three of the leaders debates, Mr Morrison explicitly referenced the length of the Government's proposed CIC bill, in the third debate speaking of ""347 pages of legislation"". But as experts previously told Fact Check, the length of the CIC exposure draft actually acted as a constraint on its powers. While the Royal Commissions Act is comparatively brief and mainly concerned with powers of investigation, the CIC legislation is substantially longer and more complex setting out parameters around factors such as what constitutes corruption and how investigations may be initiated. Dr Prasser said that in practice, this resulted in ""all sorts of curtailments or requirements for how the commission will operate"" compared with a royal commission. Professor Brown noted these issues of scope and jurisdiction were also important factors pertaining to how these powers could be exercised ""It's one thing to have a power, but if you don't have the jurisdiction to use that power — then what's it worth?"" he said. One key jurisdictional difference of a royal commission, Dr Prasser said, was a commissioner's discretion to take a broad interpretation of its terms of reference. The CIC on the other hand would be bound by legislation to limit its focus on a more narrowly defined set of issues. Associate Professor Ng also told Fact Check that the powers of the two organisations should be considered in the context of the effectiveness of the body. ""It's not just a question of the technicalities of what powers are or are not there, it's a question of how this body is to be effective,"" she said. ""It's about whether the design is set up so it can investigate matters of concern — and the way it's currently set up, it would not do so."" Specifically, she pointed to the high threshold of conduct that constituted a Commonwealth criminal offence present in the public sector division as acting on a limiter of the other coercive powers of the commission. ""If an issue can't be investigated in the first place, then you couldn't invoke those powers anyway,"" she said. A further difference between the two bodies relates to their respective funding. As Dr Prasser noted, there was usually no curtailment on a royal commission's resources. ""Some royal commissions cost more money than the total budget of anti-corruption bodies around Australia,"" he said. Resourcing was also identified as a potential limiter of the CIC in a February 2021 report published by the Grattan Institute evaluating the proposed legislation stating: ""The modest budget proposed also raises questions about whether it will be able to adequately fulfil its remit."" The report noted that the 2019-20 budget set out an annual funding allocation for the CIC of $30 million once fully established. However, the existing Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity which will be subsumed by the CIC to form the enforcement division, already has a budget of $20 million, leaving only $10 million to fund the activities of the public sector division, or substantial budget cuts within the enforcement division. In contrast, budget papers show a total allocation of $145.3 million over two years to fund the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide. A further $28.9 million over two years was allocated to the Department of Veterans Affairs to assist in responding to information requests from the Commission.

It's the day after the election and the results are still rolling in from across the country. If you've been off enjoying a Sunday sesh or the sunshine, here are the answers to five quick questions to catch you up. So far, the ABC has called 72 seats for Labor. But it is still not known if it will claim the 76 seats needed to form a majority government. The Coalition has won 52 seats. The Greens have won three seats, with a fourth one still in play. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Several seats remain in doubt, and it could be several days before there is a result. So far, 14 new women have been elected to the lower house. Three seats previously held by women were won by men. Seven seats remain too close to call including Bass, Brisbane, Cowper, Gilmore, Lyons, Macnamara, Menzies and Sturt. The outcome of those seats will determine if more women are elected to the lower house. Out of the 76 seats in the Senate, 40 are being decided this election. The ABC is projecting Labor will win 25 seats, short of the 39 needed for a majority. No government has held a majority in the Senate since John Howard's prime ministership. The Coalition could hold 30 seats, meaning the Greens and Jacqui Lambie might hold the balance of power. The Greens could have up to 12 senators — their largest-ever presence in the upper house. Lambie might have three Senate spots after her party gained a second Tasmanian seat. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson might lose her Queensland Senate seat. Her candidate in South Australia could win the final seat in that state. Clive Palmer's United Australia Party (UAP) is on track to win zero seats in the Senate. This is despite spending tens of millions of dollars on election advertising. So far, Legalise Cannabis Australia has received more Senate votes in Queensland, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania than the UAP.

117,Missed out on election night? Here's five quick questions to catch you up,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes G'day Australia. The country looks very different today after the results of the federal election. If you went to bed early, or didn't bother tuning in, here are the answers to five quick questions to catch you up. Labor won the 2022 federal election. But it is still not clear if Labor can form a majority or minority government. Labor has won 72 seats but needs 76 to govern without relying on the Greens or independents for confidence and supply - voting for the government’s budget legislation. The LNP lost 26 seats, including several high-profile MPs. The Greens are on track to win up to four seats. The independents have won 12 seats. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog Labor leader Anthony Albanese will be the next prime minister of Australia. He is expected to be sworn in on Monday morning. This is to allow him to attend the Quad meeting in Tokyo with Senator Penny Wong on Tuesday. Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles will be acting prime minister while Mr Albanese is in Japan. The son of a single mother, born into a life in public housing, Anthony Albanese has achieved his life-long wish of becoming Prime Minister. Let's start with the seats that were taken by the independents. And the Greens victory that no-one saw coming. Greens candidate Max Chandler-Mather won the seat of Griffith, south of Brisbane, from Labor's Terri Butler. Several well-funded independents ran against established Liberals on a promise of climate action and government integrity. Here's how the night has turned out for them. Now for the seats that were lost to Labor. Liberal-turned-United Australia leader Craig Kelly lost his seat of Hughes in NSW, winning less votes than the Liberal, Labor and independent candidates. As of Sunday, there are still a few key seats in play. The only good news for the Liberal party might be in the NSW seat of Gilmore where Andrew Constance, a former state MP, has achieved a swing against sitting Labor MP Fiona Phillips. The seat of Brisbane, held by Liberal Trevor Evans, might fall to Greens candidate Stephen Bates. Greens candidate Steph Hodgins-May is less likely to edge out Labor's Josh Burns in Macnamara in Victoria. Labor candidates are tightly contesting the seats of Deakin, Bennelong, Menzies and Moore. Scott Morrison resigned as leader of the Liberal Party on Saturday night. He will hand over the leadership at the next partyroom meeting. Mr Morrison said he would remain in parliament as the member for his NSW seat of Cook, which he retained despite a swing to Labor candidate Simon Earle. The next Liberal leader is expected to be Peter Dutton, who is the stand-out candidate among the party's remaining MPs.

118,Here's how to vote if you're one of the thousands of Australians stuck in COVID-19 isolation for election day,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes A last-minute change to voting rules has been made so people who have tested positive to COVID-19 will be able to vote over the phone this election. It includes people who have tested positive since last Friday night and means more people will be eligible to vote over the phone. But how exactly does it all work? Originally, the rules said only people who tested positive for COVID-19 after Tuesday night (May 17) and would be in isolation for polling day on Saturday May 21 would be able to use the phone system. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. After an uproar — including threats of a legal challenge — the Australian Electoral Commission recommended on Friday morning that phone voting should be extended to those who have tested positive since last Friday (May 13) at 6pm, in cases where they have not voted early or applied for a postal vote. The federal government accepted the recommendation shortly after it was made. Voters who are blind or have low vision will also be able to vote over the phone, and have been able to register for the service since May 9. Close contacts without symptoms cannot use the phone service, because they are able to vote in person. Yes. If you need to vote this way, you will need to register first. You can register online on the Australian Electoral Commission's website, and will need to provide proof that you have tested positive to COVID-19 after the deadline last Friday. Details of a positive RAT or PCR test, including a reference number and serial number if available, will need to be provided. Voters will need to confirm their details on the electoral roll, complete a questionnaire and choose a PIN before receiving a telephone voting registration number by SMS or email. After registering and receiving the number, electors can call in to vote until 6pm on Friday, or between 8am and 6pm on Saturday. The Australian Electoral Commission has strongly urged people to prepare before calling to vote by checking relevant ballot papers and deciding preferences first, saying phone voting is an emergency measure. The commission has warned there could be long waits because its staff need to follow a process to keep votes secure, which could take a while — especially if voters are not well prepared. By using a registration number, votes remain secret because the assistant at the other end of the line will not know the voter's name or address. The assistant will record the vote onto hard-copy ballot papers, read it back, transfer them into an envelope and place them into a secure ballot box.

119,"As the federal election campaign draws to a close, what key promises have the major parties made?",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Politicians make pledges, promises and all sorts of persuasive offers in election campaigns. But it is not easy to keep track of the drip-feed of announcements from the major parties. Before heading to your local polling booth, catch up on the major promises – or lack thereof – on five key issues. Relief from childcare fees during the COVID pandemic put the issue front of mind for many families. The prospect of easing the financial burden for parents, as well as encouraging primary carers to return to work, has seen the major parties offer significant changes. Earlier this year, the Coalition increased childcare subsidies by 30 per cent for families with two or more children (to a maximum of 95 per cent) and promised to scrap the annual cap at the end of the year. The policy costs $1.7 billion over three years. Labor matched that commitment and offered to extend the subsidy boost to families with just one child in child care, but at a cap of 90 per cent. Labor is also offering to extend subsidies to more well-off families. Currently, subsidies are means-tested and cut off when parents earn a combined $354,305 a year, but that would be raised to $530,000 under a Labor government. It is one of Labor's most expensive promises, costing $5.4 billion over 4 years. The Greens want to make child care free and universal, providing up to 100 hours a fortnight of fully subsidised care, at a cost of $19 billion over 4 years. Catch up on all the news about the 2022 Australian federal election from May 23 in our blog After two years of life dominated by the ravages of a global pandemic, health has not been the electoral contest that might have been expected. The Coalition and Labor have duelled on lowering the cost of medicines. The Coalition's promise to lower the cost of prescription medicines by $10 a script was met and raised by Labor with a promise to cut them by $12.50. The Coalition has a few other policies to lower the cost of prescription medicines for older Australians and those who need a lot of medication. Labor promised to create 50 Urgent Care Clinics by giving existing medical facilities more funding to extend their hours and range of treatments in an effort to keep patients with minor injuries and illness out of emergency departments. That promise is worth $135 million over 4 years. But neither major party promised to tackle what state premiers – both Labor and Liberal – desperately want, which is permanent, equal sharing of public hospital costs. Currently, the Commonwealth pays 45 per cent of the annual increase in the cost of providing services in public hospitals, capped at 6.5 per cent a year. But with health costs rising much higher than the cap each year, the states are left paying for an ever-larger portion of the costs. They have called for the Commonwealth to remove the annual cap and split the costs equally. But Scott Morrison rejected their call and Anthony Albanese has only offered to sit down and negotiate on the issue. Economic management has been central to this election campaign, as it has at every national poll. But for all the rhetorical questioning about who can be best trusted to manage the economy, the Coalition and Labor have broadly the same approach to reducing Australia's trillion-dollar debt. Both eschew spending cuts, other than variations on tightening public service expenditure (the Coalition increasing the ""efficiency dividend"" for government departments and Labor vowing to reduce the use of consultants in the public sector). Both also shun raising taxes or adopting new ones, with the limited exception of Labor's promise to close loopholes that multinational corporations exploit to avoid paying tax. Instead, both parties promise to improve economic growth to the point that revenue gradually exceeds expenditure so that the budget eventually returns to balance and debt is paid down over time. But the Greens are proposing a tax increase, or rather, seeking to reverse a planned tax cut. The so-called ""Stage 3"" income tax cuts have already been legislated by the Coalition and accepted by Labor. These are changes that will remove the 37 per cent income tax bracket entirely, which benefits Australians earning more than $120,000 a year. The contest of climate policy has been characterised by both internal disputes and partisan debates. But the major parties settled their climate policies well in advance of the official election campaign and have been content to focus on other issues. Both the Coalition and Labor support a target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, while the Greens want that milestone reached by 2035. Child care, domestic violence and science jobs: here's what women do and don't get in the Federal Budget. The Coalition is not budging from its Abbott-era target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, despite projecting it will surpass that comfortably. Labor's target of 43 per cent by 2030 has been backed by business groups, but not by environmentalists, who say it should be in the realm of 60 to 75 per cent. But it's not just a matter of how quickly emissions should be reduced: how to do it is just as contested. Labor's approach centres on a $20 billion government intervention to fast-track upgrades to the national electricity grid to accommodate the influx of renewable energy, which has different requirements from a system dominated by coal-fired power. It also intends to make better use of the ""safeguard mechanism"", to gradually tighten limits on pollution by the biggest industrial emitters. The Coalition's ""technology, not taxes"" approach involves funding the development of low-emissions technologies – ranging from carbon capture and storage to ultra-low-cost solar energy – on the basis that affordable alternatives need to be developed in order to achieve a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The Greens are vowing to use any leverage they have in the next parliament to push for a more rapid transition to renewable energy generation and for an immediate halt to new coal, oil and gas developments. They have also proposed re-nationalising the electricity grid and 10-year wage subsidies for coal workers leaving the industry to dampen the economic and social impacts of de-carbonising the economy quickly. Affordability for buyers and availability for renters are twin crises across the country. While the Coalition and Labor vow to address both, the struggle to purchase a home has received more attention in this election campaign. The Coalition is encouraging older Australians to downsize by offering them more tax breaks, in order to boost the supply of family-sized homes on the market. More controversially, it would also allow Australians to use up to $50,000 of their superannuation savings to bolster their loan deposits. Labor's emphasis is on its ""shared equity"" proposal, which would see the Commonwealth purchase up to 40 per cent of a home. Both major parties support an expansion of existing guarantee schemes, where people only need to have a 5 or 2 per cent deposit to avoid lender's mortgage insurance. Without initiatives to boost supply, some economists have suggested many of these policies will see further inflation of house prices. But that comes down to planning and regulation, requiring complementary action from state and local governments. For renters, immediate relief is not in sight. Labor has promised to build 20,000 social housing properties over five years through a Housing Australia Future Fund. The Coalition is promoting the continuation of the National Housing Finance Investment Corporation, which underwrites loans for community housing organisations. While increasing housing stock in future years is vital, it will not help families struggling to find affordable rentals right now.
