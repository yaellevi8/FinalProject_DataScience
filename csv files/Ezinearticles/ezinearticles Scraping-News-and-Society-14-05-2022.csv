3,Nourishing the Balance of the Universe,News-and-Society,"

					This nation's Founding Fathers, seemed to realize, and recognize, perhaps, because, of their frustrations, previously, under the English system, it was essential, to create a system of government, where no one individual, nor small, elite group, possessed, too - much power!
