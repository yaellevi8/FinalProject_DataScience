1,Uses of Silicon Carbide Ceramics in Different Industries,Buisness," With the passage of time, there has been continuous development in the world of solar energy, nuclear power, smart grid, electric vehicles, rail transportation, aerospace, aviation, and navigation. Therefore, this trend has increased requirements for power equipment performance. These days, the first generation of silicon materials is about to hit the theoretical limit that was originally determined. The third generation features a wider bandwidth, electron saturation, and thermal conductivity. In this article, we are going to talk about a new type of material called silicon carbide ceramics. And we will specifically discuss the applications of silicon carbide ceramics in different industries. Read on to find out more. As far as potential is concerned, silicon carbide ceramic is the most mature choice. As a matter of fact, many of its indicators are much better than silicon. For example, it has a 300% higher bandwidth. Apart from this, the theoretical operational temperature of this material is 600 Celsius. Now, let's talk about the different uses of this material. Electric Vehicles Since these modules can have a sustainable, intelligent, low carbon, and green development, we can say that the advantages of this material are primarily reflected in the following three aspects. 1. Simplification of the power supply Network and boosting the frequency 2. Increasing the temperature and reducing losses 3. Improving efficiency and reducing the volume As far as power conversion is concerned, components made of silicon carbide cal can help improve performance. In electric models, the active load-bearing component is the electric motor. These motors have different rotational speeds. Therefore, these motors require repeated acceleration and acceleration during the process of driving. Therefore, the working condition is more complex compared to the speed regulating system. Transmission Systems If you have a silicon-based device, your best choice is are switch made from silicon carbide. This is because this material has an extremely low resistance. Therefore, it is an ideal choice for applications where high frequency and temperature are involved. The thing is that this material can reduce the loss of power by up to five hundred percent. Moreover, it is possible to reduce weight and size by over 40%. Therefore, it can help have a positive impact on the grid configuration and adjustment of energy strategy. Solar Energy Field If you are looking for advice that can be used in solar inverters, silicon carbide is an ideal choice. It comes with a small size, reduced costs, and much higher efficiency. Typically, the conversion efficiency of these inverters is around 96%. But if silicon carbide is used, it is possible to increase the efficiency to 97.5%. In other words, these devices can help produce power losses by 25%. Apart from this, these inverters can help boost conversion efficiency significantly. LED Lighting These days, the popularity of LED devices that use silicon carbide is on the rise. The thing is that these LEDs are much brighter and can reduce the cost by up to 50%. They are 200% brighter than other types of lights. Similarly, they have 10 times more thermal conductivity. In routine life, you can apply this type of lighting for different types of environments, such as color display devices, information screens, indoor lighting, and signal lights. The thing is that they can help reduce pollution and cost. In short, these are four uses of silicon carbide ceramics in different industries."
2,An Overview of SiC Material,Buisness," Basically, silicon carbide ceramic is one of the most advanced materials. As the name suggests, it is made from carbon and silicon. In nature, it's found as a rare form of mineral moissanite. Since 1893, silicon carbide ceramic has been in production. It is possible to bind the grains of this material. The idea is to make something really hard. Since there is a rising demand for marine engineering, the automobile industry, space technology, and nuclear energy, the demand for this material has also been on the rise. Let's find out more. These ceramic offers a wide range of excellent features like chemical corrosion resistance, thermal shock resistance, increase hardness, thermal expansion coefficient, reduced wear resistance, and high-temperature resistance. This is the reason this material is commonly used in many industries, such as energy, information electronics, space technology, environmental protection, chemical industry, automobile industry. Nowadays, these ceramics are used in the form of corrosion-resistant containers in a lot of industries, such as the petrochemical industry. This material is used in different types of devices, such as mechanical seal parts, bearings, and cutting tools. Apart from this, it is an ideal choice for different types of engine components, rocket nozzles, gas turbines, and many other things. Fundamental Properties Chemical Properties In an oxygen reaction, when the temperature hits 1300 Celsius, a protective layer appears on these crystal surface. When the protective layers become thicker, the inside of silicon carbide becomes even stronger. As far as compound resistance, alkalinity and acidity are concerned, silicon carbide comes with excellent acid resistance. However, it does not have good enough alkaline resistance. Physical Properties From the density point of view, almost all types of silicon carbide crystals are the same. When it comes to hardness, this material stands at it 9.5 Mohs. Besides, the Knoop hardness level is between 2670 and 2815 kg/mm. The good thing is that this level of hardness is much higher than most of the abrasive materials, such as diamond. The thermal shock resistance and thermal conductivity are also very good. Since the thermal expansion parameters are not that impressive, SiC ceramic is one of the best refractory materials. Electrical Properties At constant temperature, commercial silicon carbide ceramic serves as a type of semiconductor. The internal resistance of this material comes down when the temperature increases. Besides, the conductivity of this material is different when it comes to impurities. Good Hydrophilicity When it comes to hydrophilicity, silicon carbide ceramic features strong covalent bonds. Based on the electronegativity calculations of Pauling, the ionic property of this material is just 12%. So, we can say that this material features not-so-good wear resistance, big elastic modulus, and a high level of hardness. Long story short, this was an overview of silicon carbide ceramic. Hopefully, this overview will help you get a deeper understanding of this material. Since this material has a lot of great features, it is used in a wide range of industries."
