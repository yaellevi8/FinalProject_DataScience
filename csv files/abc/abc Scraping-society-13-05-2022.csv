Inspired by the concept of ""human libraries"", Bunbury Multicultural Group vice chair Shamara Williams decided to set up a collection of ""international bestsellers"" as part of the area's multicultural and Fringe festivals. Over two days, strangers borrowed the ""human books"" for an hour of private conversation and spoke about everything from everyday life to individual experiences of racism. ""It's important to keep these conversations intimate to allow people to open up and actually share what's really in their heart: to be authentic, honest and raw even,"" Ms Williams said. The experiment, inspired by the Human Library movement which began in Denmark more than 20 years ago, has been set up in other places including Hobart and in Queensland. ""It's an amazing concept."" Ms Williams, a migrant from Sri Lanka, has been living in regional Western Australia for more than 30 years and jokes she's ""still not a local"". ""There's an expectation you're here for a certain number of years but that number is unknown [and] it's a lot harder on new migrants until they get to that point,"" she said. She believes the opportunity to bring people from seemingly different worlds to simply speak to each other in a safe space can reduce prejudice. ""Stories are so powerful and it has the ability to change perspectives,"" she said. ""I'd tell anyone to give it a go in your own little community."" When Shizleen Aishath first moved to Australia in 2013, she hadn't given much thought about the headscarf she wore until an incident at the shops. Ms Aishath moved to Bunbury to get settled before her husband and children joined her from the Maldives. ""I was at the shops with a friend [and] this little lady came up and spat on me and said, 'go back to where you came from',"" she said. ""The shock was so big that I did not even react ... did not even realise that I'd been spat on."" While the incident has made Ms Aishath more cautious when out in public, it has also given her more drive to stand up against discrimination. ""It made me really, really aware of our role in the community to both educate and actually speak up,"" she said. ""Because my worry was there'd be a lot of people who wouldn't."" For Ms Aishath, the library initiative provided a ""beautiful way"" for people to ask questions. ""There is a lot of miscommunication out in the community and this brings that to the table,"" she said. ""Us being such a multicultural community, we need to start doing stuff that is not just celebrating a day."" Through one-on-one conversations in the library, she was able to open up about her matriarchal upbringing and challenge assumptions about why she wore a scarf. ""[In the Maldives], it's very normal to wear a scarf and it's also very normal not to wear a scarf,"" she said. ""I was the first person in my whole family to start wearing a scarf. ""For us, it's a choice."" Ms Aishath said similar conversations had the potential to help many other minority groups including people living with disabilities and those who identify as LGBTIQA+. ""It also allows the community to have a chat about those positive experiences,"" she said. ""All these different diversity groups do bring something to the table that isn't normally discussed."" Bunbury Mayor Jaysen Miguel said while a lot of work had been done to celebrate and acknowledge diversity in the regional community, there was always room to do more. ""Support, both financially and in-kind, to events such as the Reconciliation Week bridge walk, NAIDOC Week, the South West Multicultural Festival and the new This is Me series, is crucial to not only continuing to educate our community, but acknowledge our diverse community and provide a safe, welcoming place to [be],"" he said. ""While unfortunately there may be some in the community who express outdated views, many of our residents welcome and support our culturally and linguistically diverse community."" The Mayor also encouraged people who witnessed racism and discrimination to speak out. ""When people who witness racism speak out against it, this makes the person being targeted feel supported, and can make the person being racist reconsider their behaviour,"" he said. ""Don't put yourself at risk. But if it is safe to do so, speak up and stand with the victim. Even a simple gesture can be powerful.""

1,"After 800 editions and 17 years, the future of Wilcannia's treasured local paper is in doubt",society,"  The Wilcannia News is an archive of the town's history — so what happens if it shuts down? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Ever since it went to print 17 years ago, the Wilcannia News has been run by an enthusiastic and dedicated team of volunteers. The paper's content is gathered, collated and printed independently in Wilcannia. While the already sharp decline in readership of newspapers around the country was exacerbated by the pandemic, the vital role of the Wilcannia News only became more apparent last year as the town grappled with an outbreak that was spreading like wildfire. The team has consistently managed to produce a weekly 15-page newspaper that informs and engages readers across the region and beyond — digital copies are sent as far as Brighton in the UK. But the publication has struggled to attract and retain new volunteers and has been forced to slash its weekly edition to monthly. If the volunteers can't find more help soon, the paper will be forced cease printing. Wilcannia-born Nola Whyman has used the paper as a crucial way to stay in touch with her country and community while she lives and works elsewhere. ""It's really important for me to know what's going on there, what's happening with family on the ground, what programs are being offered,"" she said. ""It's great for my kids to see photos of their cousins, uncles and aunties and everyone gathering, and it's been so consistent."" As a child, Ms Whyman used to rush out the front of the house to meet the mailman and help deliver the newspaper to the neighbourhood. ""Seeing, over the years, the positives reported in Wilcannia paper is important, because all we ever see coming out a lot of the time is quite negative of our hometown,"" she said. ""To me now what's in the media sometimes isn't the full story and that doesn't give justice to our community."" Robert Clayton from Wilcannia River Radio said the paper had been a vital platform to encourage better community outcomes. ""There are a lot of good stories here in Wilcannia, but due to the lack of volunteers they're not being told,"" he said. ""People in the community wouldn't quite push themselves as much in doing good, in what they're doing. ""To see your photo in the newspaper you'd buy three copies just to give to family. ""It's just a really good feeling that we have that sort of newspaper where we can put local people's and students' achievements in."" Christine Elliot has long volunteered at Wilcannia News, but between managing the golf club and sourcing and writing much of the paper's content, the time to hang up her hat is looming. ""We've always been stretched for labour and four of us have been involved in the paper every week since December 2004,"" she said. ""So it's been a 17-year haul and we're not getting any younger."" With more than 800 printed editions, the paper focuses on the preservation of the town's deep colonial history and provides a physical archive of happenings in the town through its regular ""History Corner"". It also publishes eulogies in full. ""One thing that has been lacking in Indigenous communities is that background of their family,"" Ms Elliot said. ""Many years ago I was asked by a couple of elders how they can do their family tree and I thought, 'Well, I don't know.' ""But this is a way we can help people in the future do their family tree, because it will be there."" The paper also acts as a public noticeboard, publishing upcoming health service visits and school information for parents. ""I just rely on it for the hospital clinics — you can put it on the fridge,"" Ms Elliot said. ""In football season we publish the football draw and most of them get stuck on fridges, and the … recording on what's happening at the schools, which is just as important. ""I think it's like everything you probably don't realise until it's not there."" Wilcannia News president John Pineo said the paper proved a vital source of accurate information when the town became the epicentre of a COVID-19 outbreak last year. ""The Washington Post picked up on Wilcannia's outbreak at the time and a lot of media scrutiny wasn't totally accurate,"" he said. ""I think living here through the outbreak, we probably did capture really the true sense of how it was."" With a mission statement to inform, connect and unite, Mr Pineo said focusing on publishing positive news while not ignoring the negatives had played an instrumental role in keeping community unified. ""What we print each week is not to point out something negative and whinge … [but about helping to] find the solution to it,"" he said. ""We try and focus on the good things happening in the town. ""I hope in a hundred years from now people will look back on it and see what life in Wilcannia was like back then."" The uncertainty of the paper's future has attracted the interest of local economic developer, RED.I. Site manager and Wilcannia River Radio host Brendon Adams has earmarked the potential for a collaboration with the town's media sector to create more secure employment opportunities. ""Even for us, as part of the radio station, we read a lot of information from the paper to inform listeners of our deadly station,"" he said. ""If Wilcannia News does fall, we are looking at making our radio station a larger media hub where we not just have radio but video and print. ""Media is such an important part for remote communities and we think it needs to continue.""

2,"So you want to be a backyard beekeeper. You, and many others",society,"  Growth in amateur beekeeping contributing $173.5 million per year to the sector For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency For this group of students, it has been a dream to keep bees. They're taking part in a beekeeping course run by one of Tasmania's most experienced commercial beekeepers. Some, like Ellie Langdon, are keen to take it up as a hobby, others are looking for a new business. ""There's a lot to it, more than I thought, but I've found it really interesting finding out the intricate details about their life and how they work,"" Ms Langdon said. ""I've nagged my husband for so long about beekeeping he did cave in and make me a hive and bought me a course. ""I'm glad I've done the course before leaping into my active hive."" Beekeeping has surged in popularity in the past five years. In that time, numbers of recreational beekeepers have tipped over 28,000 nationally, up from 23,000. Trevor Weatherhead, chair of the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council, attributes the upsurge in recreational beekeeping to media highlighting concerns about declining bee populations and the popularity of the hobbyist's Flow Hive. Mr Weatherhead said COVID lockdowns had also prompted a spike in beekeeping. ""Ironically, I think COVID has played a little bit of a role in this. I've seen a few stories out there where people have got into bees in their backyard because of COVID they couldn't go anywhere,"" Mr Weatherhead said. Military veteran Marc Webb struggled to leave his house in Adelaide, years after a serious incident in Afghanistan left him wounded and traumatised. He never thought bees would be what save him. The backyard industry has become a valuable sector in Australia. The AgriFutures Australia snapshot of the country's honey bee industry likens recreational beekeeping to recreational fishing: comparable in size to the commercial arm of the industry and just as important economically. The report authors estimate the economic value of recreational beekeeping at $173.5 million per year. In comparison, the commercial honey bee and pollination sector is worth $264 million. Agrifutures, the government's research and development arm, estimates that recreational beekeepers spend $72 million per year on bee equipment including hives, bee suits, smokers and beekeeping courses. Southern Tasmanian commercial beekeeper Peter Norris has been in the business for years. He has been running classes as well as selling bee equipment. He said the past couple of years had seen an increase in their popularity. ""People are becoming more aware of how important bees are,"" Mr Norris said. ""It increases the appreciation of how much is involved and the necessity of bees and hopefully it will help educate people about being more careful with sprays and things like that."" Mr Norris said he had run three courses so far this season, an indicator of the growing interest in the backyard hobby. A growing number of women are among Australia's surging beekeeping hobbyists. Anita Long and Jenni MacLeod run beekeeping education programs and a group called Sister Hives. ""Sister Hives started as an idea around Anita's kitchen table,"" Ms MacLeod said. ""We talked about how great it would be to run a program specifically for women."" A weekend pilot of the female-only program sold out in 48 hours. ""It demonstrated to us that there was a need for connection, community and skills-building; particularly among women who want to do beekeeping,"" Ms MacLeod said. Spring boarding off the success of the trial, the pair went on to secure funding from the Tasmanian government to run a 12-month program for aspiring women beekeepers. ""We were overwhelmed with inquiries,"" Ms MacLeod said. ""We were funded initially for 25 places but we received over 120 inquiries from across the state. ""We ended up receiving 60 applications and we then went back to our funding body to make sure that everybody could be included in the program, because the key point about this program is connection, the skills."" Across Australia there are a multitude of classes for amateur beekeepers, a multitude of groups they can join, and plenty of equipment they can buy to support their hobby. It is particularly important at a time when the industry is keen to protect our island nation's bee population from some of the devastating diseases that have wreaked havoc overseas. Industry bodies are encouraging hobby beekeepers to register with their state's Primary Industries Department, but it is not yet compulsory everywhere. Tasmania is the only state or territory that does not have mandatory hive registration, although there is hope to have it in place by April 2022. Mr Weatherhead said it was vitally important for backyard beekeepers to register their hives. ""It's important that you do register because it's a biosecurity matter,"" he said. ""If ever we did get an incursion of a pest that is not in Australia we need to know where those beehives are, then we can go out and check them."" But without penalties it could be considered soft regulation and the Australian Honey Bee Industry Council admits it is almost impossible to enforce. Taking a beekeeping course is the first step towards being able to recognise when a hive becomes unhealthy. ""We encourage beekeepers to join up with the local bee club so that way … they then realise what their responsibilities are,"" Mr Weatherhead said. ""You've got to know how to look after your beehive. They're not something you put there and leave and don't look at. You need to look at bees to make sure they're all right. ""You don't buy a new car and keep driving it and driving it without servicing it, [it's] the same sort of thing with bees. ""You need to check on them at least every two weeks to ensure they're getting enough food, they've got water supplies, the hive is not too crowded and there's no disease.""

3,'People would be outraged': Women evacuated in latest confronting domestic violence case,society,"  Remote community shocked by latest domestic violence allegations For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Two women have been evacuated from a remote Aboriginal community in northern Western Australia amid allegations of prolonged sexual and physical assaults. It is the latest in a string of disturbing domestic violence cases in remote Kimberley towns that have highlighted gaps in services and the complex cultural context making it almost impossible for women to escape. The two women had been living with a man in a house within a bush community since March. In mid-September they sought help from local police, alleging they had been subjected to repeated sexual and physical violence. People who spoke to the women in the hours after they came forward say they alleged the man held them against their will at the time, and took control of their bankcards and money. The women were flown several hundred kilometres to a larger Kimberley town for medical checks. One woman was taken to hospital and both have since given statements to police. WA Police have confirmed that a man has been charged with one count of common assault and one count of aggravated assault occasioning bodily harm. A woman who has been a social worker in the area for a number of years and knows the pair said it is a distressing case. Speaking to the ABC on condition of anonymity, she called the alleged victims ""two of the bravest women I've ever met"". ""Violence is normalised in the communities here, but this case has blown me out of the water."" She said it should be a wake up call about the severity of the violence occurring in remote communities. After a history of abuse, they are living proof that people can change. ""I feel like this would not be allowed to happen in the city — it would be leading the 6:00pm news and people would be outraged."" ""It's almost impossible for women to get out of these situations, because even if they can physically find a way to get a lift or a plane ticket to a different community, there's often pressure from families to return to their partner. ""We need help. But it's very hard to get staff out here, so the whole situation is really frustrating and really upsetting."" The police investigation is ongoing, with detectives planning to fly to the bush community in coming days to interview residents. The evacuation comes amid growing calls for violence-prevention programs tailored to protecting First Nations women; research shows they are 11 times more likes to die from assault. The Kimberley courts regularly hear horrific cases of abuse. Earlier this year, a man was jailed after he and his nephew raped a woman who they had lured from the local women's refuge. In her victim impact statement, the victim said her family had shunned her when they found out she had been sexually assaulted. In a separate case, Kimberley man Daniel Chungarai was jailed for subjecting his partner to a six-hour ordeal, in which he punched her while she was breastfeeding, shaved her head, stabbed her repeatedly, jumped on her, and tied her feet together with electrical cord. The couple's children witnessed the assaults and one — a 12-month-old baby — was showered with broken glass. Most northern towns have women's refuges run by local Aboriginal organisations, but thousands of people live in bush communities where support is limited for those wanting to escape a violent relationship. Community leaders say there is also a desperate need for programs to empower young women and challenge the normalisation of violence linked to jealousy and controlling relationships. Earlier this month, Women's Safety Minister Anne Ruston committed to developing a standalone strategy for Indigenous communities, to sit alongside the national plan currently being developed to end violence against women. The existing plan has been in place for twelve years, and the new documents will come into effect for a decade, starting in July next year. Indigenous rights activist June Oscar, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, met Minister for Aboriginal Australians Ken Wyatt last week in Broome to discuss the issue. ""I think we are making some change, but it is slow,"" Ms Oscar said after the meeting. ""We must grasp this opportunity to be frank and honest about the issues. ""But we need other ministers and all parliamentarians to listen; not just Indigenous affairs, because local women are bringing solutions to the table."" Minister Wyatt said he was committed to bringing about practical change. ""We are increasing the budget in this [domestic violence] area, but I do know there are gaps,"" he said. ""Isolation and distance to services is always problematic ... and in some circumstances people are aware of the [violence], but because they're in a small community they don't report it. ""This is a priority one for me, because the flow-on effect to children is having the visual images of a battered mother, or a battered aunty, or a battered sister. ""And that is unacceptable and it is cowardly."" Minister Ruston's office says the government is working with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Council, state and territory governments and Indigenous communities to develop the plans within the first half of 2022.

4,Rock painting hide-and-seek relieves the lockdown blues,society,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Search NSW ROCKS on Facebook and you will find more than 100,000 members participating in a group aimed at lightening the load during lockdown. The rock painting hide-and-seek has quickly become a creative activity inspiring people to paint, go on walks, and find a rock purposely planted or buried in the landscape — no matter their age. When 7-year-old Arlo and his 4-year-old sister Luciana, affectionately known as Lulu, discovered a painted rock on their walk along the Blue Mile in Wollongong, the pair were immediately captivated. ""We saw the big one first, so it was very exciting because we hadn't seen one with such a beautiful design on it before,"" their father Chris Yates said. ""And then when we read the back, then it was even more exciting because we had a little treasure hunt on our hands."" ""The rocks were all on the steps down at the harbour,"" Arlo said. When put together, the six rocks formed a turtle. ""We haven't had it for very long,"" he said. ""We discovered a few things about it, like the big triangular piece has a dot in the middle and that dot glows in the dark."" According to Lulu, the large piece is ""a love heart, not a triangle"". ""We are keeping it for a few days and then we are going to hide it,"" Arlo said. Lulu wants to keep it forever. ""We are not going to give this turtle away,"" she said. ""I like how somebody went to all the effort to paint these rocks and then hide them at the beach for us to find,"" Arlo said. ""We were really grateful … and daddy even said that we were literally the most grateful people to find it."" Mr Yates said the find had ""definitely added a touch of colour to our walks"". Kabrina Piirlaid, from Agnes Banks in the Hawkesbury region, started painting rocks when lockdown began two months ago and has already distributed more than 30 around her community. ""You don't have to draw your own image. You can find one that inspires you and transfer it over onto a rock and paint it in your own style,"" she said. Despite the call for recipients to photograph their findings and publish it on the Facebook page, many do not. But this does not stop enthusiasts such as Ms Piirlaid from participating. ""Most of the time you don't see your rock turn up afterwards. Sometimes you do, but you just keep on liking everyone and encouraging people because it's fun,"" she said. ""I'm enjoying it and it's a good thing to do."" The last time she planted rocks, Ms Piirlaid hung around to see what happened next. ""We saw someone find one. I didn't know them. They took a photo of it and re-hid it, and it was just that process of watching to see how it all works,"" she said. ""I saw it a couple of days later on Facebook and the ripple effect of happiness that comes from it all is wonderful."" Retired illustrator David Stanley's contributions to the NSW ROCKS project are exceptional, winning hearts across the state. ""In the area I have been dropping rocks there are a number of people making a massive effort, sometimes 30 rocks at a time,"" Mr Stanley said. He produces two or three painted rocks a day which takes him roughly three hours to finish. He also makes daily posts to the group which receive thousands of engagements in likes and comments. ""My main thing has been wood carving Welsh lovespoons, but the interest in the rocks has sidelined me a bit,"" he said. ""I've painted myself into a corner."" Mr Stanley said the Facebook group was helping people in at least two ways. ""They are doing the walk, and I'm doing more walking than I've ever done before,"" he said. ""Ironically, at a safe distance, I've met more people in the local community than you would come across in normal life."" As a professional artist Mr Stanley enjoys creating his contributions, but he also admires those who are encouraging their children to participate. ""People are working with their kids doing it, and that's a good thing,"" he said. ""People are doing something for someone else and that's also a good thing too."" The creators of NSW ROCKS got the idea from the Rock Painting Club SW WA on Facebook, and thought it was a great way to keep children busy. Matt Stevenson, one of the original NSW ROCKS Facebook group members, joined in 2017. “Devices are a huge distraction these days and we want to get kids painting and back into parks,” Mr Stevenson said. ""We started with 20 people on the first day and it's grown from there to over 100,000 now."" Photos on the page of painted and found rocks have gained in popularity over the lockdown period. Although there are localised groups focussing on regions like #Gongrocks, Mr Stevenson believes NSW ROCKS is the place to be. ""We don't promote other groups apart from state groups. Localised groups are exclusive whereas we are inclusive. ""If you enjoy travelling you shouldn't have to join a local group to find rocks there, you can search for it through the NSW ROCKS page."" The group's 11 volunteer moderators respond to more than 300 requests a day to join the online community. ""There are people watching the page 24/7 because you can't guarantee that everything posted on there is going to be positive, so we snuff out negativity,"" Mr Stevenson said. Its members say NSW ROCKS is all about positivity, giving people something fun to do and something to look forward to, inspiring joy. ""You can't have one without the other. It's like a giant hide-and-seek game. You need both sides to be successful,"" Mr Stevenson said. ABC Illawarra will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

5,Man left 'raw and completely degraded' after a Canberra removalist allegedly racially abused him,society,"  Canberra man allegedly racially abused by removalist makes complaint to Human Rights Commission For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A Canberra man who was left ""completely degraded"" after allegedly being racially abused by a removalist is urging people to ""stand up and fight"" against racism. Mechanical engineer Aditya Kumar said he was racially abused while trying to hire a removalist in Canberra on Monday, and has lodged a formal complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) Under the ACT government's lockdown restrictions moving residence interstate is permitted, but Mr Kumar said a dispute over what was included in the cost was what led to the racial slurs. Mr Kumar said he was called a ""curry dog"" and an ""Indian dog"" during the dispute — abuse that left him ""raw and completely degraded"". It is the second recent incident of alleged racial vilification in Canberra, after another man was abused and had his phone smashed in Civic last month. Mr Kumar, who is planning to move interstate, said he posted a removal job to a local third-party website site a few weeks ago. The job was initially accepted by a local removalist, but a disagreement arose over what it entailed. ""The argument was about me not being upfront about how many boxes I needed to be moved,"" Mr Kumar said. ""Words were exchanged, and I did not hold back either, and I was ok with it until he started making racist remarks."" Screenshots show the two men exchanged barbs over text message — including Mr Kumar telling the man: ""kindly go f*** yourself, you piece of shit"" — before Mr Kumar said the removalist racially abused him. ""Tough words over phone right you Indian dog,"" one of the messages to Mr Kumar said. ""You are full of shit you knew you would tried [sic] adding extras not the first Indian dog I've come across. ""Curry dog."" Mr Kumar said he was shocked by the comments. ""I felt raw and completely degraded,"" Mr Kumar said. Mr Kumar eventually decided to send a formal complaint to the AHRC. The ABC has contacted the AHRC for comment, but the Commission states on its website that it does not comment on individual cases of alleged discrimination, or complaints that may have been made. Mr Kumar said it was the second time he had been ""bluntly"" racially abused in Canberra, and said he chose to speak out to engender change. ""A lot of people on the Canberra Noticeboard Group on Facebook suggested that I let it go, "" Mr Kumar said. ""But every time we let one of these incidents go, it gives people like this the courage to and go do it again, since there is nothing anyone ever does about it. ""I say stand up for yourself and fight it. Let them know that is not OK.""

6,Port Macquarie's astronomical society over the moon about observatory rebuild,society,"  'Most people drive past and think it's a toilet block': Major upgrade for Port Macquarie Astronomical Observatory For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Port Macquarie's Observatory is set to get a major redevelopment thanks to a multi-million-dollar grant from the Bushfire Local Economic Recovery Fund. The local astronomical association has been successful in its application for a $4.86 million grant to upgrade the 55-year-old facility in Rotary Park. Port Macquarie Astronomical Association president Robert Brangwin said it was a fantastic achievement. ""Not just for us, the members, but for the whole district — for the businesses around us,"" he said. He said the new centre would be able to hold about 80 people and the dome would be replaced with one twice the size. Mr Brangwin described the present observatory as ""quaint inside"". ""It's got a lot of heart and soul but it's very tiny, 12 people have to duck their head to get in the doorway and the roof inside there,"" he said. ""It can be very claustrophobic at times. ""Prior to COVID, on some open nights we had more than 60 people in that auditorium and sometimes we had kids sitting in the aisles."" Mr Brangwin said they intended to employ a professional astronomer and install a much bigger telescope. The next stage is to move onto the construction plans. ""The concept is that it will look iconic on the site because it's an iconic site in town and it will stand out so people we hope will drive past and say, 'What was that'? and they'll come back and have a look,"" chair of the planning committee Chris Ireland said. It's expected the upgrade will also attract more tourists to the coastal town, Mr Ireland said. He said it was hoped they could establish ""direct links to all the major telescopes in the world"" and project them on large screens. ""It will be futuristic inside — my idea is that it will look like the inside of a spaceship."" Port Macquarie MP Leslie Williams applauded the community-run organisation. ""They've had some big plans and big dreams in the past few years and today it's all going to become a reality. ""This is not only about providing a fantastic new centre in terms of astronomy for locals but attracting visitors to the area and it will be an attraction. Member for Cowper Pat Conaghan said the new observatory would bring tourism back to town. ""We've forgotten about the bushfires, how bad they were,  the schools were closed and the shops were closed. ""Most people drive past and think it [the observatory] is a toilet block. ""This is a huge tourism drawcard for the local area."" But the most exciting aspect of the upgrade was the education facilities that would be offered, Ms Williams said. ""I have no doubt that not only schools from our local region but from across the state will be flocking here to have a look at this wonderful facility and what it offers in terms of learning more about our space."" Mr Conaghan sits on the Industry, Innovation, Science and Resources Committee — a joint parliamentary committee in Canberra. ""One of the recent inquiries we had was about space and the shortage of skills in Australia for our future space industry and this is just an appetiser, something like this is an appetiser for our young people to say, 'hey I can get into the space industry'.""

7,How social media 'robbed' mum of privacy with her dying son,society,"  How social media 'robbed' Gold Coast mum of opportunity to privately grieve her son's loss For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Sue* was 1,800 kilometres from home on New Years Day in 2020, when she received the fateful call from her eldest son. He told her that Dallas, her 21-year-old son, had been hit by a car. The freak accident had happened while crossing the road, leaving her youngest son with critical injuries, fighting for his life in hospital. Sue booked the next flight home, ""willing the plane to hurry up"" and she arrived seven hours after first taking the call. ""I was desperate to see both my sons. I was stunned and shocked upon entering the ICU to be confronted by a crowd of people – some I did not know,"" she said. ""I was not asked who we wanted there for us."" After speaking with a doctor and social worker, Sue said it was decided that information about Dallas's condition would be kept private – and importantly – off social media until they felt ready to share. ""We did not need to explain or justify our decision,"" Sue said. So, when the family began to receive ""invasive"" calls and text messages asking about Dallas' injuries, Sue grew concerned about what might be circulating online. ""I assumed my request would be honoured and respected. How wrong I was,"" Sue said. With only days to spend with Dallas, Sue said she wanted to remain calm for him. ""I wanted my son to be able to leave this world knowing we were okay to let him go, not wanting him to suffer,"" she said. Instead, the family began receiving condolence messages, long before Dallas had passed. ""I was shattered,"" she said. There were also large gatherings held – shared publicly online — and pictures of people ""getting drunk"" and ""grieving"" for Dallas, Sue said. ""I was confused. One gathering was to tell of my son's impending death after I specifically asked them not to tell. ""It was heartbreaking, considering we were sitting with my critically injured son that was still very much alive. ""I was robbed. Time with my precious son was taken away."" Sue said a Facebook group chat had been created to share updates about Dallas' condition — against explicit requests for privacy. The messages, she said, were ""fabricated"" and they told others the information had come directly from her, despite them having not spoken to anyone. ""They invited others to visit my son in hospital, without asking us. His dignity was totally exposed, his injuries were horrific,"" she said. ""It is like we never mattered."" As ill-informed social media tributes flowed for Dallas, the local newspaper misreported the date of his death and, worse, incorrectly stated his brother was his father, forcing Sue to call the journalist to correct the story. ""That newspaper gained their information from social media, no one contacted us to confirm those details,"" she said. Sue said she personally asked that no information about Dallas be shared on social media but — after her requests were ignored and disrespected — she was left feeling isolated and in disbelief, questioning herself as a parent. ""He [was still living] at home and we conversed every day,"" Sue said. ""It was like he was not mine, like he belonged to everyone else. ""Did anyone stop to think of us, what we were going through or how we would feel seeing these things?"" The ""horrid"" experience was ""life-changing"", to the extent that mundane tasks like shopping for groceries have become a challenge for Sue. ""I hate shopping. I just want to go home. [I'm] also fearful of who I may bump into, not knowing what they have been told,"" she said. ""I walk the dog at night, preferring the solace of darkness than to be seen out. ""I am in the process of moving away. I am torn, not wanting to leave this home with so many wonderful memories. ""There is not one day I have not cried since my son left us — mostly for him, for my daughter, and for my other son."" Sue felt the tragedy was exploited by some to ""keep up appearances on social media, to be the most popular, the most important and to get the most attention"". ""Peoples' addiction to social media seemed to override any sense of humanity and genuine compassion,"" she said. ""If it is another person's tragedy, it is not your place to get involved unless asked to do so. ""We received so many beautiful cards, flowers, food and messages – sadly these were overshadowed by all the hurtful things we endured."" Sue said Dallas would not have wanted the family to suffer as they did and remembers him as a ""loveable larrikin"". ""He could be funny, he could be crazy, he could be adventurous, he was loyal and he loved life,"" she said. Dr Jaimee Stuart is a lecturer in the School of Applied Psychology at Griffith University, researching young people's online and offline behaviour. Young people can be ""shielded"" from the consequences of their online behaviour because they feel distant to those they might be harming, Dr Stuart said. ""Things you say online may be very different from something you say offline because, if you say or do that to somebody in person, there would be direct consequences that you would have to face then and there."" Dr Stuart believes the remedy for this lies in broader education around media literacy, which must be modelled in the home and taught in schools. ""Without media literacy education, young people find it much more difficult to manage or self-regulate the way they behave online,"" Dr Stuart said. ""We shouldn't be using the internet as a vehicle to cause harm. ""We should be minimising harm and enabling our children to do the same thing so we are modelling behaviour at the same time. ""On the internet [you need to] think, 'If you were face-to- face with them, would you say that or not?' and, if you think not, maybe you should refrain."" * Sue requested anonymity for this story.

8,A majority of Australians say they're trying to lose weight. Jen's not one of them,society,"  The Australia Talks survey has revealed 60pc of us are trying to lose weight. Let's unpack why For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Jen Bray spent years of her life on diets, but these days she isn't trying to lose weight — and that puts her in the minority. The small business owner from Melbourne said her parents put her on Weight Watchers when she was just nine years old. ""So from nine years old I learned how to count calories, how to restrict and how to deny myself things that were enjoyable and food that's not even unhealthy — I denied myself cheese and bread,"" she said. ""They're not bad foods, but I learned before I was even a teenager to stop eating those things."" The results from the Australia Talks National Survey 2021 reveal 60 per cent of Australians are currently trying to lose weight. In fact, more people agree than disagree with this statement across all demographics — age, gender, income, region, education, ancestry and voting preference. Jen said she started to earn praise for her weight loss when she left school, but it came at a huge personal cost. ""The more weight I lost, the more attention I got, the better people saw me — society saw me — but the worse I felt,"" she said. ""I was living in constant fear of putting on weight and my whole life became about staying thin and it was at a huge cost where I couldn't go out for dinner anymore, I didn't even have enough energy to socialise."" Things hit rock bottom when one day, on the way to uni, she did not have enough energy to get off the tram. ""I couldn't get off, I couldn't stand up, I couldn't will my body to move,"" she said. Jen's mum picked her up and took her to the doctor — the event sparked a decade-long recovery. ""Even though I wanted to change, it was still so hard,"" she said. ""I'd kick the wall in the dietician's office and scream ... even just wanting to get better wasn't enough, it was many years of trying to change the way I felt about myself."" ""I've slowly gotten better and now I follow so many accounts on Instagram of beautiful fat people enjoying life, and the more fat people I'm exposed to, and see that they are living and loving and enjoying themselves fat, has slowly changed the way I think."" Now 40, Jen exercises five times a week and chooses healthy foods. ""But my weight crept back to what it was when I was 18 and I feel like when it comes down to it, maybe I'm supposed to be that way, maybe … there's no such thing as an ideal way,"" she said. ""I used to think I'd rather be dead than fat, and now I turn up at the gym, the fattest person in the class and I'm proud like, I want to show people what fat people can do."" Alex Haslam, a psychology professor at the University of Queensland, said it could come down to the stigma around size. ""The fact that everybody wants to lose weight tells you something about social norms, obviously around losing weight, but more generally the idea that being overweight is seen as undesirable,"" he said. ""If you are overweight and you're seen to be overweight then you potentially open yourself up to criticism from other people. ""So in a way, what people are saying here is, I don't want to be in a group that's stigmatised."" Associate Professor Tegan Cruwys, a clinical psychologist at the Australian National University, agreed. ""We do live in a culture which does highly value certain body shapes over others, and those body shapes aren't super easy for most people to obtain, especially in an environment where we've got this hyper-availability of delicious foods and a culture that makes it challenging for people to get enough activity in a day,"" she said. ""It is the case in our society that lots of people are carrying extra weight, not just more weight than is necessarily healthy, but also more weight than is socially valued and, as a result, a lot of people are unhappy about that. ""We do see a relationship between people who want to lose weight and and poor mental health."" Dr Cruwys says weight discrimination has become an acceptable form of discrimination in society and is often presented as constructive criticism. ""There's a really strong belief that by discriminating against people with obesity, we will somehow encourage them to lose weight, that it's like an effective behaviour change strategy,"" she said. ""But in fact, we see the exact opposite — the data tends to suggest that the more people are exposed to discrimination and stigma for their weight, the more weight they gain."" We asked 60,000 Australians about their lives. See where you fit on the issues that matter. Size discrimination is something Jen has experienced firsthand. ""Every time I go to the doctor it [my weight] is constantly pathologised without even any medical tools to find out if I actually am unhealthy,"" she said. ""I keep getting told that the way I am is wrong, but I'm healthy and I exercise … and I'm still wrong."" Jen said she recently consulted an endocrinologist about whether there were any other underlying reasons she carries more weight. ""She took a bazillion tests and it came back that I was perfectly healthy, I'm healthier than most people … no diabetes, no signs of elevated blood sugar, my heart rate, everything was great and she still said, 'have you considered weight loss surgery?' ""I just find it so frustrating."" Dr Cruwys says there is a perception our bodies can be easily changed by ""health kicks"" — but that's not the reality. ""It is extremely challenging and most people who attempt to lose weight — and most people who do lose weight — will regain it,"" Dr Cruwys said. She likened it to pushing a boulder up a hill. ""We've got all these factors working against us that are kind of pushing us as a society towards weight gain and towards unhealthy lifestyles. ""And when we as individuals try to push against that, we are really fighting a losing battle most of the time."" Dr Cruwys says what tends to be more effective for long-term change is adjusting the social context we find ourselves in, rather than individual behaviours. ""When we are spending more time at organisations that support healthy lifestyles, when we are living in environments that are really walkable … those are the sorts of things that support long-term change."" According to Australia Talks, people aged 40-49 are the most likely to say they are trying to lose weight. Ray Bondzulic is one of them. The 49-year-old Brisbane-based sales manager said the reason he wanted to lose weight was to live longer, stay fit and look good. ""I think moreso I'm trying to turn back the clock a little bit,"" he said. ""I've trained on and off for a lot of years, but I've been always trying to get the top results, and then I'd go back to my old lifestyle of just eating junk food every day and drinking every night."" Ray broke his back in a jet ski accident not long ago, which gave him a new perspective on his health. ""As I get older I think health is more important than weight, even though they're kind of related, but yeah, I feel like if I'm healthier I can deal with things a lot better,"" he said. The survey also revealed 65 per cent of Australians would characterise their physical health as good or better, and almost half of Australians said they exercised several times a week. Australians are also more likely to be part of a sporting club, gym or exercise class than a religious group, social club, or political organisation. So if large portions of the population say they're healthy and exercise regularly, why is there still such a strong desire to lose weight? Tim Douge, accredited exercise physiologist at Studio 99 in Brisbane, said the survey results highlighted the disconnect between weight and health. ""Weight loss is really complex, there are a lot of different variables that go into it,"" he said. ""Our weight is often a lot more symptomatic of how we're feeling personally and it can tie into self-confidence and body issues, so people often focus on exercise for weight loss, not for health reasons."" Dr Cruwys says the survey results suggest people are much more motivated to change their physical appearance than their health. ""My sense is that what's happening there is that most of those people who are saying they want to lose weight, they're not trying to do so for health reasons by and large, even though they might associate weight loss with health."" Two years ago the ABC asked tens of thousands of people to share their thoughts, feelings and experiences. The Australia Talks National Survey is back again — here's what we found out. When it comes to getting active and exercising, Tim said weight loss alone could be the wrong motivator. ""Exercise for weight loss is really quite hard to do — you have to exercise at a high volume every day to reach success."" While Tim said people who do regular physical activity have a better chance of weight loss, the reason people stick to exercise for weight loss long-term is for the other benefits — more energy, better mental health and better sleep. ""They then stick with their lifestyle change for other, more beneficial reasons [and] weight loss becomes a nice side effect,"" he said.

9,How to talk to your family at Easter (without summoning the Four Horsemen),society,"  How to get through difficult conversations at family lunch this Easter long weekend For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Millions of Australians will don masks and brave highways to catch up with family this long weekend, but family lunch can sometimes take a turn for the worse. Nearly all of us have ideological and political fault lines in our immediate and extended clan, often along a generational divide. The SIgnal is the ABC's daily news podcast. Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts. Whether it's climate change, religion, border closures, or just plain old party politics, most families have topics that are conversational land mines. So how do you get through family lunch without setting one off? Georgie and her brother Charlie first started making their views known to their dad Peter when they were in their late teens. ""Georgie probably more so than Charlie, but both have got very strong thoughts about what's right and wrong,"" said Peter. Peter and his wife are both retired and live in regional Victoria, and Georgie works for an NGO in Melbourne, specialising in education. ""Georgie certainly has some very different political persuasions and ideas to what I was brought up thinking."" The list of tricky conversations they've had since then is long, but one stands out. Both Georgie and Peter point to one big disagreement several years ago, and Georgie said it was a catalyst for change in their family. ""I have a fairly strong view around gender equity and I remember having a conversation with my dad around him joining an elite men's club,"" she said. ""First of all, he didn't tell me he was going to join, because he said to me: 'I knew you'd cause a fuss.' ""My brother basically spilled the beans when we were all together and I reacted in a fairly profound and devastated and frustrated way. ""I would have said to him: 'How could you possibly do something like this, I'm a woman and you are married to a woman and you'll probably have a granddaughter one day, and don't you care that you are contributing to what is gender inequity?"" ""That didn't land beautifully with my kind and generous dad, who absolutely strives to be a very good person and is a very good person."" Georgie made a special trip to see her dad and talk about it later, and she made her case about why she thought he shouldn't be a member. ""He said to me, 'Is this a deal breaker?' and I said, 'it's not a deal breaker, it's your life but it will always be something that I'll be challenged by.'"" It never came up again. ""From what I understand he's not a member of said club, but I don't actually know,"" said Georgie. Peter said he is still a member of the club. Recalling the disagreement, said it ""was not deemed to be politically correct, within the family, especially by Georgie."" ""The solution was, over all these years, 'you'll do something that I might not necessarily approve of, and I'll do the same' but I'm not going to lose a daughter over it."" Despite that specific clash remaining unresolved, it sparked a bigger shift in Georgie's family. She pitched an idea to them that from then on, rather than give gifts to each other at Christmas, they donate the money to charity — but not just any charity. In the lead up to Christmas, there's a big family discussion about where the pool of money should go and it has opened up a proxy discussion about their values, according to Georgie. ""What we value is the conversation that we can spark around areas of interest that we want to support."" She said she would recommend the same approach to other families Peter added that there's no doubt his children have shifted his own views over the years. ""Growing up in an all-boys school, going through the private school system there were things that were ingrained into us,"" he says. ""I have no hesitation in saying I was a homophobe and I am certainly not now. ""That has come about through considerable discussion and interaction with a number of the younger generation, [who] I admire immensely"". He said the same shift has happened on a range of other topics and he has no doubt his views will continue to evolve. Clinical Psychologist Dr Charlotte Keating gives Peter and Georgie's family full marks for their approach, but said it's easy for things to go a much uglier way. ""When the particular issues at hand are ones that feel very personal, where people's communication style can be more combative or reactive or judgemental."" ""When relationships break down, it's got a lot to do with poor communication leading to that loss of connection."" If the disagreement is to do with an immutable part of a person's identity, such as their sexuality, it can be incredibly painful. ""Often, deep down, there's that real sense of feeling unloved, or feeling rejected, when there's parts of ourselves that are not understood or misunderstood."" As for how to avoid family catch-ups taking an ugly turn, Dr Keating has some practical advice. ""I think it's really important to stick with your truth and to speak it from a place of heartfelt lovingness,"" she said. But that doesn't mean you're obliged to talk about topics likely to start world war three. ""We do have some level of choice about what we are prepared to actually talk about on the day."" She says if things do get heated, it's okay to hit pause and make time to discuss it later, in a different setting, perhaps without alcohol in the picture. ""That's a way of setting some boundaries about what you're comfortable with."" If a proverbial landmine has gone off, Dr Charlotte Keating also has advice on how to keep the argument from escalating. She refers to the well-known psychological framework, known as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, coined by an American husband and wife team of clinical psychologists, Julie and John Gottman. The Gottmans' research suggests the presence of these so-called four horsemen are very accurate predictors of whether or not a couple will ultimately separate. But Dr Keating said the theory is also a useful tool in managing family conflict. The Four Horsemen: Noticing these behaviours in yourself and in others can help cut problems off before they become a problem, said Dr Keating. ""You want to notice things getting emotional before it gets to that point,"" says Dr Keating. And finally, being aware of these behaviours can also help to plan for conversations ahead of time, so you can prevent the Horsemen from showing up. ""Even role playing with a partner or a friend,"" said Dr Keating. ""It takes the anxiety and the tension out of it for you because you've got a way of navigating it, you've done it before.""

10,Nerrissa says she's suffered years of racism at school in Victoria — and not just from other students,society,"  Greater Shepparton Secondary College student says racist incidents left her feeling 'subhuman' For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Senior student Nerrissa Leitch should be concentrating on her studies, but she says she is often exposed to racism at school that makes her feel ""subhuman"". ""Many of my friends come from different backgrounds, different nationalities, and they've been told to go back to their own country. Things like the n-word,"" said the 17-year-old Yorta Yorta and Gunaikurnai woman. Ms Leitch is in her final year at Greater Shepparton Secondary College (GSSC), which was found to be ""a picture of systemic racism"" in a scathing report obtained by the ABC. Commissioned by the Department of Education and Training after a series of race-related incidents, the independent report found the workplace was ""complicit"" in racism experienced by students. Ms Leitch said she had encountered racism over a number of years at the school. ""It's not only the students with racist opinions, it's also the teachers and the staff,"" Ms Leitch said. ""I really think the staff also need cultural awareness training, and to be more culturally inclusive."" The same recommendation was made in the report, written by cross-cultural consultant Georgia Birch, which was presented to the school in November but has not been publicly released. The ABC has attempted to contact GSSC for comment. Among the report's 47 recommendations is for the school's all-white leadership and all-white teaching teams to take part in ""ongoing cultural intelligence training"". The report found ""a high number of racist incidents"" experienced by students had involved teachers. It also said some teachers were reluctant to report racist behaviour for fear of being isolated or bullied by colleagues. There are approximately 575 students from multicultural backgrounds enrolled at Greater Shepparton Secondary College, and more than half are Aboriginal. Other students come from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Congo, Malaysia, Philippines, Samoa and Tonga. When I was a teen, I wanted to be the cool black girl, the safe black girl. But that came with baggage I wasn't ready for. Despite its diverse cultural mix, the report found the school's leaders had one-dimensional view of multiculturalism and Aboriginal culture in the school, and had suggested that ""tokenistic interventions, such as having Aboriginal artefacts in the foyer"" were enough. Meredith Peace, the President of the Victorian branch of the Australian Education Union, said neither the union nor the school's staff had been given a copy of the report. ""Media reports in relation to the Department of Education's report suggest there are significant issues that would concern our members and the school community,"" she said in a statement. ""GSSC staff must have the opportunity to understand the contents of the report and be engaged properly in the work required to address the issues raised. ""Racism should never be tolerated and we expect the Department to provide the additional resources necessary to assist the school community to tackle the issues."" A spokesman for the department said that racism was never acceptable, and that a cultural steering advisory committee had been established to examine the report and its recommendations. ""It will be the cultural advisory steering committee that provides advice to the school about the best way forward from this point,"" said David Howes, the deputy secretary of schools and regional services. ""The challenges that the school faces are the challenges that the broader community faces and what is happening outside the school does impact what does happen inside the school."" Suzanna Sheed, the independent member of state parliament for Shepparton, said aspects of the report were ""obviously very concerning,"" and that resourcing in the area was an ongoing issue. ""We have high levels of disadvantage in Shepparton and we have to fight for resources,"" she said. ""And we've been doing that for so long with so many groups in our community, all addressing issues, putting out fires, treating things as a crisis when they arise. ""I think this is a real opportunity for us all to work together, look at all the programs and organisations we have in our town and see how we can go forward."" The report comes at a time of immense change, as four high schools are merged into the college to address poor educational outcomes. New facilities are being built to create a ""super school"" at a cost of $121 million. Once the capital works program is completed, Greater Shepparton Secondary College will become Victoria's largest government school, with an anticipated enrolment of 2,700 students. Ms Leitch said she would love to see the school introduce more programs to allow Indigenous children to connect with their Elders, and wellbeing areas so that students have a safe place to go. ""A language program would be something that's so special, and just more programs for Indigenous kids, and not just Indigenous kids, for all cultures,"" she said. The changes may come too late for Ms Leitch, as she prepares to graduate this year. But she says change is needed so that other children don't have to experience the same racism she and her friends endure each day. ""I don't want the future generations to experience what we've experienced,"" she said. ""It's just not good enough. I think everyone deserves to belong, and everyone deserves to have a safe space.""

11,"Safety audit finds 'immediate, severe risk' to residents at a Gold Coast aged care centre",society,"  Safety audit finds 'immediate and severe risk' to Southport Lodge aged care centre residents For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A Gold Coast nursing home has failed every quality standard in a surprise audit by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission (ACQSC). A report published by the ACQSC shows the Southport Lodge was non-compliant in all eight of its measured quality standards during an audit conducted December 15-18, 2020. The ACQSC identified that there was an ""immediate and severe risk"" to the safety, health or wellbeing of Southport Lodge residents. It has imposed a six-month sanction on the Southport Lodge, barring it from receiving Commonwealth subsidies for any new care recipients for six months. ACQSC's report said the facility did not have a sufficiently skilled workforce to ""provide safe and timely quality care"". ""The service does not adequately demonstrate that deterioration or change of a consumer's mental health, cognitive or physical function, capacity or condition is recognised and responded to appropriately, specifically in relation to consumers who experience a fall overnight or develop an acute respiratory illness,"" the report says. ""There are no registered staff available overnight to assess consumers who may experience a deterioration during this time."" A lack of understanding of strategies required to minimise a potential COVID-19 outbreak was also noted, as well as no documented palliative care or end of life procedures. The facility also faced losing its approved aged care provider status unless it appointed an adviser to help it comply with ACQSC standards, and provided relevant training within six months for officers, employees and agents. The ACQSC said Southport Lodge, which is owned by Planlow Pty Ltd, had already taken action, appointing an adviser on December 31, and it would continue to be monitored. The Southport Lodge has been contacted for comment. Fadden Federal MP Stuart Robert said the health, safety and wellbeing of senior Australians was of utmost importance to the Australian Government. ""If the provider fails to take timely remedial action, there are other actions that the commission may take to ensure the safety of care recipients,"" he said. ""The Serious Incident Response Scheme legislation includes additional regulatory tools providing the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner with functions and powers to respond to serious incidents and provide compliance notices and directions to take action, and will also include imposing civil penalties, infringement notices, enforceable undertakings, and injunctions."" It follows the abrupt closure of the Earle Haven nursing home in Nerang in 2019, which left 68 elderly residents homeless. Earle Haven also formed part of the Royal Commission into Aged Care, which heard half of the residents were being physically restrained in the weeks before it closed. Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia CEO Geoff Rowe said he was surprised by the breaches. ""What really concerns me is this is happening at a time when there is a spotlight on aged care,"" he said. ""Over the past 18 months they have had a Royal Commission that has been looking at the quality of care in aged care and you would think that is a time when providers would be on their absolute best behaviour."" He said unannounced audits by the ACQSC to nursing homes, like the Southport Lodge, were turning up concerning results. ""Rather than in time gone by where aged care facilities were told, 'You're going to have an audit on this date, you can expect the quality auditors to come in', we saw quite bizarre things happening — and this is not about Southport Lodge — but certainly other facilities on the Gold Coast where special crockery and cutlery was brought in for the audit, there were special meals, clients who were seen as difficult were taken out for the day,"" he said. ""There was a real facade around the whole audit process. ""Now with the unannounced visits, they're just turning up and getting a phone call to say, 'We're out the front, we're coming in' and we're seeing it, warts and all."" Beth Mohle from the Queensland Nurses and Midwives Union said the issues raised reflected ""a fundamental failing"" of the aged care system.

12,'I don't need alcohol to be myself': Why more people are going booze-free,society,"  Sober lifestyle grows in popularity, with more Australians giving up alcohol For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Ten years ago, teenager Ezrah Waith was in a bustling nightclub on the Gold Coast's glitter strip, with lights flashing and music pumping, when he had an epiphany. ""I just remember standing in the middle of Sin City and realising I didn't need alcohol to be myself,"" Ezrah said. It was almost sacrilege in the schoolies' capital of Australia, where drinking alcohol is a veritable right of passage for many. ""They call it 'liquid courage' for a reason — because it gives people the confidence to do things, but I felt I was always comfortable with myself."" Now 30, Ezrah and his wife Tyrene are proud to remain booze-free and it seems their sober lifestyle may be catching on. According to an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) triennial survey, the number of people who had ditched the drink rose from 1.5 million to 1.9 million between 2016 and 2019. Weight gain and hangovers were cited among the reasons. The AIHW report found the proportion of ex-drinkers had fluctuated since 2001, but 2019 recorded the highest proportion of ex-drinkers over that period. The coronavirus pandemic may have disrupted people's drinking habits in 2020, however, the AIHW said no clear patterns had emerged yet of the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on alcohol and other drug consumption. Christmas parties and work social gatherings can often be an irritating experience for the sober-minded, but the advent of no and low-alcohol drinks has allowed people like Ezrah and Tyrene Waith to fly under the radar. ""It's not so much that the questions annoy me, but it gets repetitive after a while if you are constantly explaining why you are not drinking,"" Ezrah said. ""I like non-alcoholic beer and gin and tonics; I've found ones that are quite enjoyable. They taste very similar [to an alcoholic drink]. ""It's more socially acceptable to drink non-alcoholics. When you are not drinking, people think you are not having fun. ""People will hardly ever notice you're drinking non-alcoholics."" Faye Lawrence is the founder of Untoxicated, a non-drinking network of 8,000 Australians who socialise over morning teas and activities like mini golf and camping. They are part of a growing movement called ""sober curious"". Ms Lawrence said whether people drank alcohol or not did not have to be ""black or white"". ""It's about having that sense of curiosity and picking for the individual what works for them and how they want to show up in the world. ""It's that mindful drinking, where one day you might have an alcohol-free vodka or wine, and other days you might want to go out with mates and have a big night."" Ms Lawrence said ""cool, fun and attractive"" alcohol-free alternatives helped non-drinkers overcome the fear of missing out. ""We're social animals, we also want to fit in and if you turn up and have an alcohol-free cocktail, no-one is going to notice that you're not drinking, so a big deal doesn't have to be made about it,"" she said. With the rise of the sober curious, Burleigh-based distiller Catie Fry is tapping into a market that traditionally only catered for beer and wine drinkers. Ms Fry is the first distiller in Australia to produce a zero-alcohol and mid-strength range of white spirits. ""I wanted to make something that was complex, bold and rounded, but do it in a lower-alcohol form and be able to have a couple of drinks and be okay,"" Ms Fry said. ""You'd call them a botanical vodka, but they're crafted very much like a gin."" The distiller's inspiration came after being treated ""like a house plant"" during her two pregnancies, when the only drink options were water or juice. ""It's distilled in exactly the same way; I work with 21 different botanicals all up in my range of three infusions and I craft my botanicals with a wheat-based spirit,"" Ms Fry said. The mother, wife and entrepreneur said she was also determined to change the culture of the male-dominated distilling industry. ""I didn't have much of a chance to be in the distillery uninterrupted, which I get. You can't have kids running around in the distillery, someone's got to look after them,"" she said. ""But I got excluded a little bit, so I bought a copper still and experimented when the kids went to sleep."" Her three varieties are marketed to a female audience, but the mother of two said she was surprised by the overwhelming interest they had from men. ""People said if I was too feminine or female-focused, then you'll lose half your market and alienate men,"" she said. ""But I don't think anyone's ever said that to Jack Daniel, Jim Beam, Johnny Walker or XXXX, which are marketed to men and consumed by women. ""Little wins like this for women show young girls that they can be a distiller too, or have their own distilling company, or mechanic shop, or anything really."" Ms Fry hoped her company would help bring about a shift in the drinking landscape. ""Things are changing and there are so many amazing craft distilleries that are getting with the times and becoming more inclusive so look around, be proud and you'll find others who want to come along with you,"" she said.

13,"In 2021, the NT will introduce surrogacy laws — but that's 'too late' for some",society,"  The NT Government will introduce surrogacy laws in 2021 — but it's 'too late' for some For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tara and Luke Kaspar have been trying to have a baby for the past decade. They've spent nearly $100,000, raided their superannuation accounts and been through 28 rounds of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) — falling pregnant twice and miscarrying both times. Luke, who comes from a big family, says as tough as it's been financially, it's been tougher still on their mental health. ""It was tough mentally and on the hip pocket, but more mentally,"" he says. After years in limbo, Tara and Luke are just months away from becoming parents using Tara's sister as a surrogate and egg donor. But the couple lives in the Northern Territory — the only jurisdiction in Australia with no surrogacy laws — so their journey is far from over. When their twins are born in June, Tara and Luke will find themselves in a stressful legal purgatory, because surrogacy in the NT is neither legal or illegal. Doctors still don't know why Tara hasn't been able to carry a baby to term. After her second miscarriage, Tara and Luke asked their doctor about legal surrogacy options. They say they were stunned to discover the Northern Territory had none. Darwin council alderman and mother-of-two Rebecca Want de Rowe says she was similarly shocked when making her own enquires about surrogacy five years ago. Rebecca, whose husband Kent is the Director of NT Parliament, had a miscarriage in 2016 when she was 11 weeks pregnant with the couple's third child. ""Through my grief, and sharing my story with a lot of people, it really became obvious how many women out there are struggling with infertility [and] miscarriages,"" she says. ""People who I thought were choosing to not have a family, were actually not having families because they were not able to."" Rebecca wanted to be a surrogate herself, but without the legal framework to support her, she wasn't able to push ahead with her plans without leaving the Northern Territory. So, in 2018, she launched a petition calling on the NT Government to introduce altruistic surrogacy legislation, laws which can't be used for financial gain. The NT Government has now committed to introducing surrogacy legislation, but with the bill yet to be introduced or debated in NT Parliament, their ascension to law could be months off. For Rebecca, that means having to travel interstate to become a surrogate for friends in Sydney — if coronavirus travel restrictions allow — which will also mean taking time away from her job and two young children. And for Tara and Luke, whose children are due in June, it will also be too late. Tara's sister Renee Andrews says she didn't hesitate to offer to be a surrogate for her sister and Luke. ""Of course I was going to do it, that's my younger sister,"" Renee says. ""They're very loving people and these kids are going to be very blessed."" Renee, who has three young daughters herself, will deliver Tara and Luke's twins at the end of June. But because Renee is giving birth to the babies, and there's no surrogacy legislation in the Territory, it will be Renee's name on their birth certificates — not Tara's. Tara will need to adopt the babies or push for a parenting order after they are born and until then, she won't be able to get maternity leave, which means they will continue to chew into their savings. ""It's like we haven't endured enough pain to have to endure more,"" Tara says. ""It feels like it's never going to end, we'll have to keep jumping hurdles."" Sarah Jefford is the only lawyer in Australia who exclusively practices in surrogacy and donor conception law in Australia. She's also an IVF mum, egg donor and former surrogate and describes helping another couple start their family as ""one of the very best things"" she's ever done. ""When surrogacy hits the headlines, it's often negative,"" Ms Jefford says. ""I never once regretted it, and I've never spoken to a surrogate that has regretted it."" Across Australia, between 60 and 80 babies are born via surrogacy every year, and Ms Jefford wants Australian families to be able to discuss infertility without the fear of stigma. She says she knows dozens of Northern Territory families who have moved interstate to access surrogacy or used an overseas surrogate because they didn't want to relocate. ""I probably get one or two enquires a month from people in the Northern Territory who think, 'I need to pack up and go,'"" Ms Jefford says. ""All the other jurisdictions have had surrogacy legislation from as early as 2004. ""Most surrogacy legislation is from about 2008 to 2010, so it's been a while, it would have been nice if the Northern Territory had caught up a little sooner."" For families who choose to stay in the Northern Territory, such as Tara and Luke, the way forward isn't clear cut. And Ms Jefford says any new laws introduced in the NT must put the rights of the child first, before the interests of the surrogate or the intending parents. ""Any laws around children really need to focus on the child's best interests at heart,"" Sarah says. This means giving children access to information about who their biological parents are and if they're conceived with the help of a donor. Tara and Luke hope that sharing their story will help other Northern Territory families struggling with infertility, and to let them know they are not alone and there is hope. Despite the legal challenges ahead, Tara and Luke are simply grateful to have two healthy babies on the way. ""It's amazing, thinking we'd never have kids, to now having two,"" Tara says. They're catching up on all the sleep they can before the twins come home in June.

14,Regional Victoria and Melburnians embrace as COVID-19's 'ring of steel' falls,society,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Melbourne woman Sarah Vincent was on the road with her family well before the crack of dawn today as Victoria's ""ring of steel"" was lifted. Over four months, Ms Vincent and millions of friends and family members were kept apart by the separation of greater Melbourne and the rest of the state, enforced at the height of the state's coronavirus crisis to limit travel. On Sunday at 11:59pm it was finally relaxed, and Melburnians and regional Victorians came together on Monday for the first time since July. Melbourne has come into line with regional Victoria's coronavirus restrictions. Here's what that means for cinemas, sport and travel. ""We know so many people have missed those they love the most, those they need to see and have been desperately keen to see for such a long period of time,"" Premier Daniel Andrews said. Ms Vincent had not seen her mother, Wodonga resident Jennie Johnson, in six months — aside from the odd message or video call. The escape to the north-east Victoria also meant her two-year-old son Blake would have more space to play and spend precious time with his grandparents. ""It felt so good to see my mum and have a cuddle. I've been waiting a long time for it,"" Ms Vincent said. ""It's been very difficult, especially with a little one and not being able to have everyone around. ""I had a lot of mental health issues being in lockdown all the time, I couldn't go anywhere."" Jennie Johnson said she was on the verge of tears when she saw her daughter pull into the driveway with her young family after counting down the hours. ""We've been hanging out for this, it's been very difficult not being able to see them all,"" Ms Johnson said. ""It's been difficult not watching the little one grow up — missing his birthday, missing everyone's birthdays. It's given me a new appreciation for family."" The family said they planned to go on picnics, visit the shops, and spend some quality time together. ""Blake seeing his grandparents is a massive thing, and him being able to be a kid and run around having fun, getting muddy, and not being locked down,"" Ms Vincent said. ""It's so different out here. It's like I can breathe again."" Melbourne woman Zoe told ABC Radio she was headed for Anglesea this morning for a surf at long last. She told Virginia Trioli's Mornings program it ""felt like life was coming back"". ""It looks like it's going to be heaven,"" she said. ""We gave a big 'whoop' when we hit the 25-kilometre mark and the ring of steel, and said 'goodbye Porpoise Spit'."" Kate from Ballarat said she was looking forward to seeing her son this weekend, having been separated for five months. She said the most frustrating thing had been tough restrictions in areas of the state where there had been few cases. ""We've been waiting for Melbourne to open up, we've had very low numbers. Some areas in the western region have had none,"" she said. ""You've got little businesses that are struggling because we're waiting for the whole state to be on par, and that's the hardest part."" The timing of the Government's decision could not have been better for Gordon Bahn from Leongatha in South Gippsland. Mr Bahn and his wife Gillian today celebrated their 52nd wedding anniversary with their daughter Diane and granddaughter Zoe who travelled from their home in Melbourne's south-east. He said it was ""lovely"" to see his family for the first since June. ""One of the things that Diane wanted to come down for was to wish us a happy anniversary,"" Mr Bahn said. ""And Zoe loves to do her cooking, so she cooked us a little cake for our anniversary, that was very enjoyable, and just an enjoyable time to have them here together."" But he said he did not have plans to travel to Melbourne to see his other grandchildren while there was still a risk of catching coronavirus. Mental health service Beyond Blue received thousands of calls from Victorians seeking support over the past four months. Among the main queries received were concerns about isolation, general uncertainty, job losses, and not being in touch with family and friends. Beyond Blue's lead clinical adviser, Grant Blashki, said with the state open again, there was a great feeling of enthusiasm and relief as people could reunite. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Victorian news. ""There's obviously a lot of joy and relief, but I'm also seeing mixed emotions,"" Dr Blashki said. ""There's a bit of apprehension — particularly older members of the community who have lost confidence and are nervous, and also those who may be dealing with anxiety getting back out there. ""I think a lot of regional people not having access to tourist dollars has been a really big hit and they're excited to see people visit again."" Dr Blashki said it could be tough for some people affected by the lockdown and separation moving forward. ""I'm suggesting people take it slow, particularly those who have had anxiety or stress.""

15,"Puppy prices soar during lockdown, with breeders and shelters struggling to match demand",society,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Barb Traeger knows just how hard it has become to get a dog. When she retired in June, she decided it was the perfect time to get a puppy. She had owned dogs previously, she had space at her Langwarrin home in Melbourne's outer south-east and she knew she would have the time to spend with a pet. Ms Traeger initially looked for a Jack Russell puppy online but the cheapest puppy she could find was selling for $5,000. ""They were just way out of our price, they were very expensive,"" she said. It took many applications, but Ms Traeger was able to adopt a dog instead. She has been enjoying training her dog Allie during Melbourne's extended lockdowns, saying it has given her something positive to focus on. For teacher Kate Ellis, it was a case of just in time, when she purchased her puppy. She organised to buy a dog before COVID-19 for her 40th birthday, but by the time she was able to pick up her Airedale puppy, Melbourne was in its first lockdown. ""It was incredible timing, I was living on my own at the time and I got this incredibly vivacious, very hilarious dog,"" she said. She said her puppy brought a lot of fun to her life during a difficult time. Data from Melbourne councils show just how strong demand for dogs has been. In Maribyrnong City Council in Melbourne's west, more than 1,000 more dogs have been registered this year, compared to the same time period last year. Hume City Council in Melbourne's north has seen nearly 700 more dogs registered since lockdown started this year compared to the same time period last year, while the City of Stonnington in the city's south has seen a rise of nearly 200 extra dogs being registered. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic The RSPCA's Tegan McPherson said the organisation had seen a significant increase in applications for pets this year. ""We have seen in excess of 26,000 online applications to adopt a pet since the start of the pandemic,"" she said. She said the RSPCA has had hundreds of applications for some dogs. ""It has been really difficult for the staff as well, because obviously people are disappointed or become a bit frustrated (if they miss out on a dog) and unfortunately it is just the nature of the demand we are seeing at the moment,"" she said. Border Collie breeder Jacqui from Gippsland said demand for her puppies had gone through the roof since lockdowns started, with a lot of enquiries coming from Melbourne. But she said some people were not thinking through how big a decision it was to get a dog. ""You don't just get a puppy because you are bored, you get a puppy because you have been looking for a while, you are focusing on it and you want a puppy long-term,"" she said. Jacqui is worried the state will see more dogs in shelters after lockdowns end. She has not raised her puppy prices because of the pandemic, and said she was shocked to see some border collie puppies being sold for about double the usual price. The Australian Association of Pet Dog Breeders president Tracee Rushton said there had been an incredible jump in demand particularly for small, apartment-friendly dogs, and oodles — dogs that are crossed with a poodle. Ms Rushton said registered breeders had to match market rates, to avoid creating a secondary puppy market. ""The problem is if we don't price our puppies in accordance with the current market rate, what we have found is that we get people purchasing puppies for a cheap price, then turning around and immediately reselling those puppies for a greater amount,"" she said. ""That is not what we want to see as breeders, we want to see our puppies go to a forever home."" She said families struggling to find or afford a dog could consider adopting a breeding dog, with many retired by the age of about four, or contacting breeders to see if they are willing to negotiate on the price. While Julie Nelson from the Master Dog Breeders and Associates said supply had become a problem during the pandemic because many Victorians usually bought dogs from interstate, but that had become difficult with border closures.

16,"'Parliamentarian, soldier, rail enthusiast, family man': Tim Fischer memorial plaque unveiled at Albury Train Station",society,"  Tim Fischer memorial plaque unveiled at Albury Train Station For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Members of Tim Fischer's family have attended a memorial plaque unveiling at the Albury Train Station to honour the former deputy prime minister. The plaque was unveiled on the first anniversary of Mr Fischer's state funeral that was held in Albury on August 29, 2019. Although Mr Fischer's wife, Judy Brewer, was unable to attend the event due to the coronavirus pandemic and the NSW-Victoria border closure, Ms Brewer witnessed the event via FaceTime. The Fischer family was represented by Mr Fischer's brother, Tony Fischer, and his sister, Vicki Baudry, who unveiled the plaque. As well as being a parliamentarian, diplomat, author, rail enthusiast, farmer and soldier Tim Fischer was also a broadcaster and chose to host his ABC Great Train Show podcast series out of the Wodonga studios in 2008 and 2009. The plaque was gifted by the ABC and honoured Mr Fischer's contribution to the local community and beyond and acknowledged his love of the Albury Train Station. Ms Brewer said she was pleased a memorial plaque for her husband was now at the station. She said the station was one of his favourite places and he often used it for travel, meetings, interviews and book launches. ""It  was our 'meeting place' in Albury both before we were married and after. He could always entertain himself there if I was running late!,"" she said. Before his state funeral was held at the Albury Entertainment Centre last year, Mr Fischer's funeral train stopped at the station and a military service was held on the platform to honour the Vietnam veteran. In the Great Train Show podcast series, Mr Fischer often spoke of his love for the station and its important place in Australian history. The Albury Railway Station is heritage-listed and officially opened in 1882. It was designed by the engineer-in-charge for the New South Wales Railways, John Whitton, and includes a platform that is 455 metres long — one of the longest in the southern hemisphere. The station played a significant role in the Second World War, the different gauge system between states on the New South Wales and Victorian border meant hundreds of soldiers swapped trains in Albury during the war. Mr Fischer often spoke of the individuals who stood on its platform due to the change in rail gauge. Notable travellers included authors Mark Twain and Agatha Christie, opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, cricketer Don Bradman, and military leaders General Sir John Monash and General Douglas MacArthur. The Duke of York, who later became King George VI, would have once stood on the platform, as would Saint Mary MacKillop and various politicians including Australia's first prime minister Sir Edmund Barton and the first woman elected to the Australian House of Representatives, Dame Enid Lyons.

17,Adelaide Showground 'eerie' with inactivity after first cancellation in 75 years,society,"  Adelaide Showground 'eerie' with inactivity after first cancellation in 75 years For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A veritable ghost town has replaced what should have been the city's busiest location at this time of year, according to Royal Adelaide Show (RAS) stakeholders, but all is not lost thanks to online interest in some of its most popular offerings. Originally scheduled for a September 4 start, the Adelaide Show's stages, carnival rides, marquees, stables and exhibition displays would have been getting assembled behind the Showground fences for an annual event that brings about $317 million to the SA economy. ""We'd be in the final stages of set-up here, about seven days from where the livestock start rolling in, so we'd be right in the thick of it,"" Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of SA chief executive John Rothwell said. Instead, the show was cancelled in April due to COVID-19 restrictions, the biggest in a string of event cancellations at the 26-hectare multi-purpose venue in Adelaide's inner-south. Other than skeleton staff, maintenance workers and perhaps a few tourists in its new caravan park, the showground has been at its quietest since the last disruption during WWII. Mr Rothwell said the ""dark days"" in the pandemic's first few months created an ""eerie"" atmosphere at the venue. Just 10 per cent of its full-time staff were still coming to work, while others were made redundant or put on reduced hours with the support of the Federal Government's JobKeeper package. ""We have lost 95 per cent of our income, which is extraordinary, and it happened in the third week of March when all our events and exhibitions just disappeared overnight,"" he said. The show is by far the biggest loss, however, accounting for up to 60 per cent of the society's revenue in regular years. The digital world has offered some respite, with the show's two high-profile ram sales, the Elite Sale and the Merino and Poll Merino sale, to be held online. The Royal Adelaide Beer and Cider Awards will also still be held, along with its Wine Show, despite the public elements of those competitions having been cancelled. ""We have a few exhibitions and events still booked for the last quarter of this year, so our focus now is on those we can accommodate, as well as those in February and March next year,"" Mr Rothwell said. Other stakeholders feeling the loss include Showbag Shop director Emily Williams, whose company usually produces about 1.1 million showbags for capital city and rural shows, including about 250,000 for the Adelaide event alone. She said 90 per cent of their income came from shows right across the country, most of which had been cancelled. Despite her company also relying on the JobKeeper package to retain staff on reduced hours, Ms Williams said they turned out to be busier than expected thanks to a boost in showbag sales online. ""I think there are a lot of families who couldn't go to their show but wanted to retain their tradition of buying showbags,"" she said. ""When they hear they can still buy them, they do. ""It can also be people buying gifts, showbags for the kids to keep them entertained, birthday presents and kid's parties."" Mr Rothwell said the first time the Adelaide Show was cancelled was during the Victorian Gold Rush of 1852 when men rushed interstate, erroneously ""assuming that the women who were left behind could not run the show"". It was also cancelled during the WWI and WWII years, as well as during the Spanish Flu pandemic, which was spread by soldiers returning from WW1. He said the society had gone into debt in order to stay afloat, but had benefited from the City of Unley waiving its council rates for 12 months, and a Federal grant of more than $2 million. It had also used the time to finish a versatile caravan park ahead of schedule in the south-east corner of the showgrounds, where old stables were demolished. Among those missing their chance to present their best efforts at the Adelaide Show this year are photographers, artists, cooks, horticulturists, pet owners, livestock workers, dairy farmers, tropical fish enthusiasts and flower lovers, to name a few, plus countless companies from the exhibition halls. Embroiderers' Guild of SA member Susannah Whitney, who won Best Handicraft Exhibit in Show during 2019, said members would otherwise be very busy preparing for the show. ""I think everyone is still working on things, but we just haven't been able to get together and see them,"" she said. ""Normally we have our stitching group meetings every week, where we all meet and stitch together and look at what each other is doing, but we had to close down in March and are only just starting to reopen.""

18,National shearer shortage looms as New Zealanders battle the border,society," ABC Rural For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australia's shearing contractors and wool producers fear a national shearer shortage with COVID-19 border closures and travel restrictions, making it difficult for New Zealand shearers to enter the country. Key points: Every August an influx of 500 shearers from New Zealand arrive in Australia primed for spring shearing — but not this year. They handle at least seven million sheep over three months and head home to New Zealand for their own season in December. Shearing Contractors Association of Australia (SCAA) secretary Jason Letchford said the looming workforce shortage was a major concern for the industry. ""We are really in a desperate situation to get the sheep shorn this year in spring,"" Ms Letchford said. Read our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic He said if sheep were not shorn in time, the season would be extended, which would cause financial losses for producers and also pose a risk to animal welfare. ""If you don't have good animal husbandry practises you lose your asset,"" he said. The SCAA is working with the Department of Agriculture, Home Affairs and state governments to find an agreement on New Zealand shearers coming to Australia. Mr Letchford believed a fast and proper solution was needed. ""I realise that the governments are walking this very narrow band between safety and keeping the virus at stake, but there are jobs and commercial issues at stake,"" he said. ""It can't just be a blanket approach where we turn of the tap in one area and it has unintended consequences across other industries. ""But we have a critical shortage of shearers in Australia and we the New Zealand workers who are COVID-19 free,"" he said. ""At this point in time with the $3,000 entry for quarantining and actually getting through an Australian port is making it look unlikely any will be able to come across."" Mr Letchford said with the drought breaking in many parts of Australia the national sheep flock was only set to surge from the current 65 million head as farmers look to rebuild and retain more stock and more shearers would be needed. Craig Gilbert, who runs Woolaway Contract Shearing in Naracoorte, South Australia, feared he might not be unable to secure a full workforce if the agreements for NZ shearers entering Australia did not change. His business brings half of its staff into the area as seasonal workers from interstate and overseas, but he might have to work with a skeleton workforce and ask growers for more flexible shearing arrangements. ""We simply don't have the numbers of shearers here in Australia to cover all that to get it done in the time frames that growers require,"" Mr Gilbert said. ""If the sheep need to get shorn and they don't get shorn that will have a significant impact on the area, on growers and on their price and on the wellbeing of the animals."" ""It's not just like you can say we are going to shear your sheep in December instead of October. Of course the season changes, and it gets a bit hotter, the animals can suffer from grass seeds, they can suffer from flies, and that's distressing for the animal."" He found it ""somewhat frustrating"" to see New Zealand shearers denied entry to Australia and believed the Department of Agriculture needed to step up and understand the significance of shearer coming from New Zealand, which now was a COVID-19 free country. Mr Letchford recognised many Australian's were out of work due COVID-19 and were looking for work. Shearing was still a skilled trade that had to be learnt over time. ""We do welcome people to the industry but the reality is you won't be able to pick it up overnight, so we are not going to be able to retrain a Virgin flight person to be a be a shearer suddenly,"" Mr Letchford said. ""People come into the industry and start as a shed hand and we would love that, and there is plenty of training available for that."" However, he is not aware of any people from COVID-19 impacted industries trying to enter the shearing and wool handling industry. ""New Zealand has the labour force that we need as we just don't have enough skilled workers here in Australia to do it."" ""It's very frustrating that we can't easily access those workers in New Zealand."" But it's not only Australia's shearing sheds that are short-staffed. New Zealand's industry also fears a workforce shortage for its peak season starting from November to March, when usually shearers from Australia and the UK flock to the nation. New Zealand Shearing Contractors Association president Mark Barrowcliffe said a delay of their season was on the cards and despite talks with their Department of Immigration there were additional challenges to bring overseas shearers into the country. ""We have to comply with quarantining rules for the staff, that's putting a cost on either the person coming over or the employer, so there is a few issues to deal with there,"" Mr Barrowcliffe said. ""We want to do it faithfully for the employee and whatever country they are coming to or are leaving from."" While the industry remained hopeful about their discussions with the Department of Immigration, Mr Barrowcliffe said they were also upskilling local stuff to partly pre-empt the looming shortage. However, with the situation of New Zealand shearers heading to Australia, he believed there was a 'bigger reluctance' from workers due to the increasing coronavirus cases in Australia. ""We are a very family-orientated industry, so once you move away from your family at the moment, you can't just pop back quickly if something happens, and the family coming first is definitely keeping a few people at home,"" he said. ""They are just not prepared to risk their own communities or risk not being able to attend and event if something happened."" The Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment said in a statement provided to the ABC that WoolProducers Australia (WPA) and the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) hade identified the need for more than 480 seasonal New Zealand shearers and shedhands for July-November. ""The department recognises that the wool industry traditionally uses a mobile pool of workers, including a group that moves from New Zealand to Australia for a substantial proportion of its workers and that extended delays to shearing can pose serious problems with regard to animal welfare, on top of the commercial impact for wool producers,"" the statement said. WPA and the NFF are seeking support for New Zealand shearers and shedhands to enter Australia using exemptions from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. In the statement, the Department of Agriculture said, at this point in time with Australia's borders closed, the only means to get workers in is for travellers to seek an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner based on those workers providing critical skills. ""Ultimately it is the decision of the Australian Border Force Commissioner as to whether or not to approve a border exemption."" The movement of workers between different states is governed by state health directions, the statement said. ""It is important that potential workers and employers understand those requirements before they seek to travel."" ""Feedback from industry to the department is that recent border closures are, in general, being managed well and not causing significant difficulties.""

19,"The African-Australian community is suffering a crisis of confidence, and one community leader is working to solve it",society,"  Ballarat's African community is punching above its weight — it just doesn't realise it For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The African-Australian community in Victoria's Ballarat punches above its weight, but the community itself struggles to realise its own potential. The president of the Ballarat African Association (BAA), Michael Akindeju, knows how much African-Australians contribute to the local community. But Dr Akindeju says the community itself is suffering from a shortage of self-esteem and he wants to change that. ""We are punching above our weight, nominally,"" he said. ""But that is not what the community is reflecting."" The BAA started 15 years ago and now has more than 1,200 members hailing from 14 different African countries. ""Most of our people here locally in Ballarat are professionals,"" Dr Akindeju said. ""We have a large portion of our population that work in daycare, in the primary healthcare sector … medical doctors, we have professional engineers, only a few really are unemployed."" Dr Akindeju said stereotypes, casual racism and discrimination have taken a toll on the community's confidence. As an example, he spoke of a community member who had run a successful business in Africa, hand-making shoes, but since arriving in Ballarat in 2013 has not felt he could set up and run the same business. When asked why, Dr Akindeju said the man worried his product would not be seen as being up to Australian standards and there was not a path to foster his enterprising ambitions. The stereotype of the African migrant as a low-paid, poorly-educated worker — and not as the entrepreneurial, self-assured businessman — has created a self-fulfilling prophecy which Dr Akindeju has intended to break. ""It's had a great impact on self-identity and self-esteem,"" he said. ""The reflections that the community would give back to us will still be the stereotype … they have battered the self-worth and self-image of our people."" This problem is something the community is solving themselves by running a series of workshops to help community members to develop a sense of purpose. In doing so Dr Akindeju hopes it will ""rebrand the African identity"" in the community. The workshops will pair career and financial advice with the more existential tasks of developing a long-term ambition to strive towards. Dr Akindeju expects these workshops to succeed because, crucially, they are being planned and run by the community itself. ""To date, programmes have been designed and have been run by agencies and governments in Ballarat, for Africans, and have not acknowledged adequately the nuances of our culture,"" he said. ""And so mostly, what you find is that they are just ticking the boxes — but that is not sufficient. ""It doesn't lead to sustainable developments."" A key part of the BAA workshops is promoting the stories of exceptional community members, like 23-year-old Lamourette Folly. Ms Folly was born in a refugee camp in Benin, a small country in Africa's Gulf of Guinea, after her family travelled there from neighbouring Togo. She spent the first 11 years of her life there. ""When we came to Australia there was another culture that we had to try and circulate our life around,"" Ms Folly said. ""And the Australian culture was immensely different to our culture."" But this has not tempered her ambition. Ms Folly is currently studying a master's degree in international tourism and hotel management, but also wants to be a journalist, having studied that field as well. ""I haven't let identity stop my path in life,"" she said. Ms Folly wants to empower other young people in her community, including her younger brothers. ""One thing African kids have in common is competition,"" she said. ""You know, I keep telling them [my brothers], 'If you do a diploma, I'll do my bachelor's; if you do your bachelor's, I'm going to do my master's; if you go and do your master's, I will do my PhD'. ""So we keep trying to better each other. ""Because I see, if I do better, the younger kids in our community are going to look at me and say, 'Oh, Lamourette is doing that — why can't I do it?'""

20,73 millionaires did not pay a cent in tax — but it wasn't all through negative gearing,society," Updated 
    
      July 20, 2020 10:02:29 Seventy-three millionaires paid no tax in 2017-18, while Australia's richest people live in Sydney's Double Bay, on average earning more than 16 times the nation's poorest, who live in central-west Queensland.  The latest taxation statistics for 2017-18 are based on the tax returns of 14.3 million Australians. Seven of the nation's average highest earning postcodes are in NSW, while six of the lowest earning postcodes are in Queensland.  There were 73 Australians who earned more than $1 million in the 2017-18 financial year that did not pay a cent of income tax, up from 69 the year before. Negative gearing remains a popular tax break. More than 1.3 million of the nation's 2.2 million landlords declared a net loss on their investment properties. Almost 1.8 million of those landlords had a mortgage on their property and were claiming interest deductions — that is about 80 per cent of property investors. Postcode 2028, Double Bay, had the highest average taxable income, at $242,428. The second average highest earners, with an average taxable income of $198,828, live in postcode 2027, taking in Sydney harbourside suburbs Darling Point, Edgecliff, HMAS Rushcutters and Point Piper.  The third average highest, earning $196,816, reside in Melbourne's postcode 3142, taking in Hawksburn and Toorak. DOVER HEIGHTS, HMAS WATSON, ROSE BAY NORTH, VAUCLUSE, WATSONS BAY The nation's poorest income earners reside in mostly small towns in Queensland. Postcode 4732, which takes in Muttaburra and Tablederry in central-west Queensland, has the lowest average taxable income in the country at $14,681.  This was followed by postcode 4426, including Jackson, Jackson North and Jackson South, with an average income of $19,396. And third lowest was NSW's 2308 — the Newcastle University, Callaghan area — with an average income of $21,054. ERRINUNDRA, MANORINA, CLUB TERRACE, COMBIENBAR, BEMM RIVER, CABBAGE TREE CREEK, BELLBIRD CREEK $27,617 The 2017-18 statistics also cover average taxable income by occupation and state. Medical practitioners again dominated the highest earning occupations, much like the year before. Surgeons on average made $402,582 in taxable income.  Anaesthetists filled the second spot with an average income of $382,674, and internal medicine specialists came in third with an average income of $301,129. Financial dealers took fourth place with an average income of $272,895, while psychiatrists took fifth place with an average income of $225,206. The lowest-earning professions were dominated by hospitality, with farm work and baggage handlers also featuring. Fast-food cooks are the lowest earners (average income $18,608), followed by hospitality employees ($19,102), hospitality apprentices or trainees ($19,431), farmers ($20,089), farm, forestry or garden workers, apprentices or trainees ($20,686), and baggage handlers ($22,244).  There were 14,907 Australians who declared a total income of more than $1 million in 2017-18. Combined, they reported $37.4 billion of income — an average of just over $2.5 million each — and collectively paid $15.9 billion in tax, a total tax rate around 42.5 per cent.  However, out of that millionaire group, the data also show 73 paid no net tax in 2017-18. For 54 of those millionaire earners, that was because they had enough deductions to lower their taxable income below the tax-free threshold of $18,200. For whatever reason, one other million-dollar earner fell below the threshold but still paid $721 in tax that year. A further 19 people who earned more than $1 million that year declared taxable incomes above the tax-free threshold but still managed to avoid paying tax, presumably due to various offsets and rebates. The statistics suggest this is a generous group, at least in terms of donations and gifts that are tax deductible, which totalled just over $1.4 billion and made up almost three-quarters of the gap between total and taxable incomes. Negative gearing property does not seem to be a strategy favoured by this ultra-high earning group, with net rental losses of just $121.3 million claimed between them, and a modest rental profit of almost $20 million reported overall. The Australia Institute's senior research fellow David Richardson said it wasn't just millionaires getting away with tax minimisation. The data also shows that more than 2,000 people earning between $100,000 and $1 million per year succeeded in paying no income tax. ""Australia's tax system is shot full of expensive and inequitable loopholes,"" Mr Richardson said. ""A key principle of a fair tax system is that people with similar incomes should pay similar amounts of tax, but in Australia that principle seems to have been completely abandoned. ""There are people on the minimum wage paying more tax than people with million-dollar incomes.""  The average landlord reported just over $21,000 in rental income, with around $13,300 in interest payments, more than $3,400 in capital works and more than $10,100 in ""other deductions"". The median, or typical, landlord received less rental income but also had a much smaller loan and other expense claim.  Of the 1.3 million landlords reporting net losses, the average was $9,156 and the median was $5,670. Part of the difference between the median and average reflects the fact that the median landlord only holds one investment property, while the average is skewed higher by those who own two or more. Nowhere is the difference between the median, representing the typical person, and the average, skewed by the wealth, more apparent than in share investing. Of the just over 2.8 million people who declared they had received franked dividends, the median payment was just $557, while the average was more than 15 times higher at $8,743. Likewise for the tax credits associated with receiving franked dividends, which were typically worth $240, while the average was $3,634. This distinction between the median and average sharpened further when it comes to capital gains, or the profits from selling investment assets. Of the slightly more than three-quarters of a million taxpayers who reported a net capital gain in 2017-18, the median was just $2,290. The average was $30,794, meaning relatively few people made some very large gains.  Want to find out how much your neighbours earn? Search for your postcode in the ATO database below. Median income is what the middle, or typical, person in your area earns.  The average is generally skewed higher by those whose who earn a lot more than what the typical person does. All of these are ""taxable"" incomes, meaning after any deductions for things like work-related expenses, managing tax affairs or offsetting losses, such as those from negative gearing property. If your postcode is missing, it is probably because the ATO has only included postcodes in this table where at least 200 people filed tax returns, which also explains why none of the lowest income areas in the table above do not appear in this table, because they all had fewer than 200 taxpayers filing returns.

21,What should life look like after this? Our top writers share their hopes for post-COVID Australia,society,"  Australian authors share their hopes for life after COVID-19, from social justice and mindfulness to women's work and biosecurity For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency While we're not exactly sure when and how this pandemic will end, things are slowly beginning to return to a semblance of normalcy in Australia. But do we want normal? What can we learn from this time of great instability and slowdown; from long stretches spent away from our loved ones and our workplaces? And what about the future of those people and sectors — including the arts — so adversely impacted by the lockdown? Do you love books? So do we! Join our Facebook group to talk books — with each other, with specialists from across the ABC and with your favourite authors. As social distancing restrictions shift and we reorientate ourselves once again, ABC RN's The Book Show asked five prominent Australian novelists — adept at imagining different worlds and ways of being — about the kind of country they'd like to see on the other side of this pandemic. ""We've been given an opportunity to change our ways. It's a warning of sorts,"" says Noongar novelist Kim Scott, reflecting on both the summer's bushfires and the current pandemic. Scott sees this as a chance for ""reweaving our moral fibre"" and restructuring our society around social justice and equality in education, health and housing. The two-time winner of the Miles Franklin Award (for That Deadman Dance in 2011 and Benang in 1999) says that there were moments during the pandemic when he thought we were moving in that direction. ""[But] my sense of that opportunity has been derailed by the callous destruction of a significant site in the Pilbara,"" says Scott. During National Reconciliation Week, mining giant Rio Tinto detonated explosives which destroyed two 46,000-year-old rock shelters. ""Something in the intimacy and connection and the common concerns of humanity [that we'd developed during the pandemic] was just destroyed in that explosion,"" says Scott. His optimism was also shaken by the death of George Floyd, which sparked a wave of renewed Black Lives Matter protests in the United States. Protests in Australia followed, focussing on Indigenous deaths in police custody. ""Racism, and the refusal to acknowledge it, is a problem here in Australia and the cause of a big divide,"" the writer says. Tune in for author interviews and news from across the book world. Scott's 2017 novel Taboo told the story of a community reckoning with an historical massacre of Noongar people. But for Scott, a post-pandemic Australia needs to go beyond acknowledgement. ""We need to think about rebuilding in the interests of social justice, starting at the foundations,"" he says. He says that that foundation should be the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which would ensure that First Nations voices are heard and centred in the rebuild. Alice Pung is a journalist, essayist and writer who has often explored racism in her writing — including in her young adult novel Laurinda and her award-winning memoirs Her Father's Daughter and Unpolished Gem. Pung says that Asian Australians have often been viewed as ""the model minority"" — which has meant that their problems haven't always been recognised — but that the pandemic has both fuelled and drawn attention to racism against Asian Australians. ""So I guess it's been a very eye-opening time for everyone,"" she says. ""Yet having grown up in a quite rough suburb, and having lived experiences of sometimes quite physical racism, I can assure you that there's an underlying tide [of racism in Australia] that the wrong kind of political stoking could ignite."" Pung's family have been a major support to her during the pandemic. ""I hope [out of this] we recognise the importance of extended families, especially the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren,"" she says. Through the pandemic, Pung has been educating her children from home, giving her a new appreciation for the work of teachers. ""I hope that post-pandemic we will understand, appreciate and imagine all the things that teachers do during a day to occupy our children,"" she says. Anna Funder is a Miles Franklin award-winning novelist (All That I Am, 2012) as well as the author of internationally acclaimed nonfiction novel Stasiland. Like Pung, Funder says she was struck by how much we've relied on teachers through the pandemic, as well as health workers — workforces that are largely female, underpaid and insecure. ""What I really hope coming out of this is that they are paid [better] for that work,"" she says. ""[And that] the incredible skill and the incredible emotional intelligence it takes to do [that work] is valued … [instead of being] undervalued because of the feminisation of those workforces."" Funder — like many writers — is used to working remotely, but she's had two of her children learning from home during the pandemic too. She's observed that conversations around home-schooling have been led by mothers. ""The women were trying to work at the same time as they juggled the work of running a household — which primarily falls to them — as well as additionally … the work of homeschooling,"" Funder says. She's hoping the pandemic has made women's work more visible, which might result in more equitable domestic workloads. ""[I] hope for some more permanent gender recognition of what goes on in feminised workplaces, outside the home and within the home,"" Funder says. Stella Prize-winner Heather Rose's latest novel, Bruny, is about a family fight that also happens to be a political fight, over a bridge between Tasmania and Bruny Island. ""I've been thinking a great deal about what the world might look like beyond 2020. And how we might shape a future that works better for all of us,"" says Rose. ""I think COVID-19 has given us a really interesting shift in values. We've been able to see what makes our communities work and what doesn't."" Rose is concerned by job losses due to the coronavirus shutdown, as well as future job losses brought on by increasing automation. ""It's time to bring in a universal basic income that protects our most vulnerable,"" she says. The future of the environment is also on Rose's mind. ""I am really saddened by the fact that we have allowed our natural resources to be dug up and shipped out,"" she says. ""That has made a lot of mining companies and a lot of magnates very rich … [but] it's done nothing for the long-term wellbeing of Australia, as we face the challenges of life with dwindling resources."" Moving forward, Rose would like to see a ""sovereign wealth tax"" on the extraction of minerals and resources, the proceeds of which would be used to fund health, education and renewable energy. ""I would also like to see us give very serious consideration to agricultural security and biosecurity into the future,"" she says. ""If we really do want to move forward, we've got to lead more mindful lives, and we need our solitude. We need our sabbaths,"" says writer and human rights advocate Arnold Zable. Zable's beloved 2001 novel Cafe Scheherazade was set in a St Kilda cafe that became a local institution, and Zable says that during the pandemic he's been spending more time in his neighbourhood. ""We've gone perhaps from the global to the local,"" he says. The author has been taking long walks and conversing more regularly with his neighbours. ""It's triggered memories of past times when … people have been more open to each other."" But Zable acknowledges that these simple pleasures are not universal, pointing to the situation of refugees in Australian immigration detention. ""We have to become more conscious of the need to be advocates for a society in which we truly do care for each other, and a society that really tackles structural inequalities,"" he says. Zable recently released an essay collection titled The Watermill, which includes four stories — from across the globe — that explore trauma, memory and resilience. ""Thinking about the post-COVID-19 future, I think it's important to focus on what we've gone through, and not to forget it.""

22,Birpai woman leading campaign to remove statue of Edmund Barton from burial site,society,"  Campaign grows against statue of first Australian PM Edmund Barton at Aboriginal burial site in NSW For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Thousands of people have signed a petition demanding the removal of a statue of Australia's first prime minister, Sir Edmund Barton, from a traditional burial site in NSW. Port Macquarie's Historical Society President agrees the statue is in an inappropriate place Port Macquarie woman Arlene Mehan, of the Mid North Coast's Birpai people, is leading the campaign to force Port Macquarie-Hastings Council to move the statue from Town Green park on the banks of the Hastings River. The seven-day-old petition has more than 2,100 signatures and comes amid global action by the Black Lives Matter movement to tear down statues of white historical figures. Ms Mehan said the Barton statue had always been an issue with her family. ""You wouldn't put a statue of Hitler in a Jewish space, so it's been a bit of a thorn,"" she said. ""It's a burial site and you're putting a figure of white Australia on an Aboriginal burial site — it's just not appropriate."" The statue of Australia's first prime minister is close to a small monument on the burial site. ""Everyone knows that statue but not everybody knows the monument to the burial site, which is located only 10 metres from that statue,"" Ms Mehan said. Remains at the burial site are more than 1,800 years old, she said. ""As a Birpai woman, I'm looking for something to dismantle in the local community that represents racism and the statue does,"" she said. ""Consider what this statue means for us as a community and what message we are giving to, not only members of the community, but visitors as well. ""It brings up a lot of trauma for people, how we glorify these figures."" Ms Mehan said she would present the petition to the council and was open to talks on the statue's future. ""The onus is on the council, who had put it there without community consultation in the first place in 2001, the onus is on the council to remove it,"" she said. Port Macquarie Historical Society President Clive Smith said he there was ""absolutely no reason"" it could not be moved. ""In some ways, as being Australia's first prime minister and a connection with the area, maybe it is appropriate to have a statue of him somewhere in the vicinity but probably not at that location,"" he said. An ABC-wide initiative to reflect, listen and build on the shared national identity of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Sir Edmund, a member of the Protectionist Party, was a local state MP before federation in 1901 when he became the nation's first PM. He played a key role in drafting the national constitution and his government passed the Immigration Restriction Act, forerunner to the White Australia policy. He later became a founding member of the High Court. ""I can see why it would not be considered appropriate by probably a good percentage of the population when he was one of the authors of the constitution, which basically wrote the Aborigines out,"" Mr Smith said. ""I don't have any particular opinion on statues except that I often think there are too many statues to dead white men whose achievements get reviewed from time to time and are perhaps not as great as they were once thought to be."" The Port Macquarie-Hastings Council said it was not appropriate to comment on a petition it had not received.

23,Family of five receive new bushfire recovery 'pod' home just in time for winter,society,"  Family hit by bushfires on Mid-North coast score first six-person pod to house them while they rebuild For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The first of around 200 six-person pods providing semi-permanent homes for bushfire-ravaged families has been delivered to a family of five on the New South Wales Mid-Morth coast. The Disaster Recovery Minister, Deputy Premier John Barilaro, was on the Willis family's property at Yarranbella, west of Macksville, to hand over the keys. Carpenter Patrick Willis said the 12-metre dwelling would be a welcome change from camping out. ""It's been a bit cosy in the camper trailer, a bit cool at night, so the pod's going to be very helpful,"" he said. ""It's been a bit of fun really, the camping part of it — but it's wearing thin now."" The shack they had bought, just before their property was devastated by fire, was to be home until they built a house. ""I don't mind the camping but it's hard work for Karly with the kids,"" Mr Willis said. ""You know what kids are like — it gets pretty muddy out here and coming into winter it's been some chilly nights of late, so it will be a bit nicer to be out of the camper and into something with hard walls."" At the height of the bushfires, Mr Willis' parents also lost their home to fire on the South Coast. ""On New Year's Day, got the phone call that my family home where I grew up — where my brother, his kids, my parents live, had also burnt,"" Mr Willis said. ""It took the wind out of our sails. I'd had enough"" The arrival of the pod coincided with the day of their second wedding anniversary. ""I would like to say I went to a lot of trouble to organise this to land on today, but it's just a bit of good luck,"" Mr Willis said. ""But she deserves some good luck. ""I can turn our skeleton of the house back into a job site and get things out of the way so I can work in there a bit more comfortably and easier."" Mr Willis said he was most looking forward to not having to fill a cast iron bath everyday. ""Just not having to light a fire and wait for two hours to get some hot water is pretty cool,"" he said. ""Washing machine's a big one, we have a lot of dirty clothes out here with little kids.""

24,"Using ropework, recycled pots and intuition to build a suburban garden empire",society,"  Succulents, traditional ropework and sustainable materials create garden haven for retired couple For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency There is love in the air at the sparkling suburban garden belonging to Anna Sofocleous and her partner, Nick Skourmallas. The retired Wollongong couple, who exhibit and sell a range of succulent plants in pots in their back garden, have found comfort in their self-isolation, even when customers have been stroppy about self-distancing. The busy hobbyists produce an array of gifts, mostly using recycled and salvaged sustainable materials like old teapots, discarded jewellery and clippings from Mr Skourmallas's aunt's garden. Ms Sofocleous sits on the back porch of an afternoon, patiently creating macramé potholders, an airy change from the aged care facility where she spends mornings with her mum. ""When I retired, I became interested in the idea of doing more hand crafts whilst I was taking care of my elderly mum, and I found macramé,"" she said. ""I sit every day, talking to my mum, doing my macramé ... listening to her stories, and it became a hobby and I'm enjoying it."" Ms Sofocleous took up macramé, a form of traditional ropework using knots, four years ago. What she couldn't remember from the 1970s, she learnt by watching YouTube videos. Want more local news?

There are only basic instructions on YouTube and then you just have to figure it out yourself,"" she said. When she first started, it took close to six hours to make one macramé potholder, but now she is whipping them out by the hour. ""It was really difficult, and I was going to give up,"" she said. Sometimes Ms Sofocleous includes beads in her designs, which, like all her other materials, she picks up for very little cost. ""I cut up salvaged necklaces,"" she said. She recommends cotton rope but warns that nothing lasts forever, especially recyclable, sustainable materials. ""macramé doesn't last forever. It gets very dusty. Because it's a natural fabric the weather will, within five years, rot it. It will fall to bits."" Mr Skourmallas is responsible for the succulents that go into pots, as well as a vast assortment of other plants in his 30-year-old garden. ""When I bought this house there were only three rocks around the letterbox. That was the garden and I've put in all this garden myself,"" he said. His friends, neighbours and Greek aunties have helped him out a lot. ""When I go and re-pot their pots, they say, 'take whatever you like, Nick,' so sometimes I come home with six or seven bags ... full. ""I go walking every day and old people call me over. Sometimes I have to call Anna with the car, I've got that much,"" he said. ""There is so much you can propagate on your own. You can make your own, and it's never ending."" He is an old-fashioned gardener, relying on sunshine, clean water and intuition. ""Stick your clipping in the dirt, not too deep, and keep it moist and out of the sun for the first few weeks,"" he said. He knows within two weeks whether a plant is likely to survive or not. ""It will let you know. It will either change colour, the stem may rot, it will fall down, or you'll see the new shoots coming. By four weeks it's ready to sell,"" he said. As customers queue two by two to peruse and purchase the plants, Ms Sofocleous delights in her achievements. ""If you go searching, you'll find a lot of recyclable stuff. People can do this. There's so much out there, and you can actually do it yourself.""
