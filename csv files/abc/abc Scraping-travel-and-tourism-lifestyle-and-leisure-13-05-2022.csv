0,New push for Kalgoorlie and Esperance air link in a potential 'game changer' for WA's south coast,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Proposed air link between Kalgoorlie and Esperance a potential 'game changer' For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tourism officials hope a new partnership will make flights between Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Esperance a reality on Western Australia's south coast later this year. It comes as the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder steps up efforts to reinstate an eastern states air link, which was suspended at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Kalgoorlie-Boulder-Esperance Aviation Development Partnership is made up of the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, the Shire of Esperance and tourism body Australia's Golden Outback (AGO). AGO Esperance tourism development manager Simon Latchford said negotiations were underway with prospective carriers and was hopeful flights could begin as early as September. He quipped the ""walls are coming down"" after two years of the pandemic and WA's hard border ending in March. ""For us to be able to work together to get large aircraft running services out of Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide into Kalgoorlie, we can then leverage off that by providing an appropriate connecting service between Kalgoorlie and Esperance,"" Mr Latchford said. ""That's a game changer … from a business perspective you can fly up in the morning and fly back in the evening in Esperance. ""So it's great for business and it's great for tourism, obviously, because people can now access the region."" Regional Express (REX) is the only commercial passenger service flying into Esperance on a government-regulated route from Perth. The airline began operating the route in February 2016 and has a contract with the state government until June 30, 2023. Meanwhile, the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been canvassing the local business community about preferred days for flights to Melbourne. A short online survey asked questions such as how many times a year businesses would use the service and for what purpose. Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport manager Chris Barnes said he could not discuss which airlines were in negotiations about an eastern states air link. He said there had been ""excellent feedback"" from the business community. ""We already have an understanding, from our historic numbers, of what the average traveller would be using those services for and what the peaks are,"" he said. ""It's important we understand what the business travellers are seeking and what businesses are requiring on those routes, so when we look at negotiating these routes, we can understand best what works best for everyone."" Virgin Australia's direct flights to Melbourne were suspended when the pandemic prompted the introduction of tough border restrictions and eventually forced the airline into administration. Qantas previously ran direct flights between Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Adelaide but the route was axed in 2014 due to poor ticket sales. Meanwhile, the state government today announced $4 million to underpin new direct flights between Karratha and Geraldton. Operated by Aviair, the new route expands the existing Inter-Regional Flight Network, which currently provides flights between Karratha and Port Hedland, Newman and Broome, and Newman and Port Hedland. WA Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said it would significantly reduce travel times, with many small business and FIFO travellers in Geraldton currently travelling to the Pilbara via Perth.

1,A bird's-eye view of tractors seeding in WA's Wheatbelt at night,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure," ABC Rural Tractors seeding crops in WA's Wongan Hills blend with the stars from the night sky For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency When Virgin Australia pilot Kris Parnell was stood down at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, he headed out to Western Australia's wheatbelt to help at the family's tree nursery and drive harvesters for a season. Now that he's back in the air full time, Mr Parnell says it's a joy to look down over the same area from 36,000 feet, or 11,000 metres, and see the tractors seeding through the night. He said for most of the year it would be a sea of black, but during seeding and harvest, it was a different story. ""It's quite incredible when you get a dark night like we've had this week with no moon early in the evening. It's just a sea of lights that look very much like stars,"" he said. ""We fly on our instruments so it doesn't really affect us but if you're flying on visual cues to know which way the plane was up, you'd find it very hard to know because the stars and the ground look exactly the same from all the tractors and the seeding equipment."" Mr Parnell took a photo from the air about 150 kilometres north-east of Perth, near the Wongan Hills area. He said the glow in the picture was Perth city. ""I just took that picture because I've been describing it to my dad and a few mates out there from when I was working on the harvester, and I thought, 'I'll have to try and get a photo of this,'"" he said. ""I was just playing around the long exposure on the phone and that photo came out so I was pretty happy with that.""

2,Bear essential: Treasured teddy rescued from outback after dad's travel photo blunder,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Lost teddy bear 'Pooh' reunited with family after being lost in the outback For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A long-lost teddy has finally been reunited with his family months after being left behind in outback NSW. Gordon Wilson left his son's treasured bear 'Pooh' on a fence post along the Barrier Highway near Broken Hill in March while part way through a 5000km journey from Bowen in north Queensland to Perth in WA. Mr Wilson had been taking photos with the bear as a way of keeping himself and the family entertained. After being ""distracted by flies"" and driving off – it took hours for Mr Wilson to realise he'd left his son's prized possession more than 150km away. He decided against going back, and that's where the real adventure began. He and his wife Lois Wilson logged onto to social media and began posting on Broken Hill Facebook groups, asking if someone had seen or picked up the bear. What happened next came as a shock to the Wilsons. Their appeals for help were shared all over the internet. ""I was actually quite amazed by the reaction and how many people were following the story,"" Mr Wilson said. Grazier Mitch Rodgers was one of those interested onlookers. Determined to reunite the family with their beloved bear, he drove out from Comarto Station near Wilcannia to find Pooh where he had been left. While the plan had initially been to post him back in the mail, Mr Rodgers and Mr Wilson thought the adventure should continue. So they decided to harness the power of social media to find more people willing to travel with the bear across to the west coast. ""Mitch went to great trouble and started to share the story on social media with some great photos,"" Mr Wilson said. ""The story then took on a life of it's own and if it wasn't for Mitch it probably wouldn't have got off the ground like it did."" He said Pooh's journey garnered interested from as far afield as Scotland, where he had relatives. He said Pooh travelled 150km to Broken Hill and visited Silverton before heading south to Mildura in Victoria. ""He then received a lift from a couple to Adelaide and from there flew to Perth,"" he said. ""I'll tell you what it took off pretty quick,"" Mr Rodgers said. ""It was just good to hear that people were getting a bit of joy out of it."" 24-year-old Ben Wilson, who's had the bear since he was a baby, is still stunned that so many people dedicated their time and effort to make sure the teddy was returned. ""I thought that was it, and I was never going to get him back,"" he said. ""I'm grateful for Mitch, the Broken Hill community along with anyone and everyone who was involved,"" Ben said. Asked if Pooh would be having any more adventures anytime soon….the answer was ""unlikely"". ""He'll be staying with me until I have my first child and then when he or she gets old enough, I'll tell them the story of what happened here,"" Ben said. ""Because it's not something we're going to forget anytime soon.""

3,First new baby in decades brings life to tiny town where a dark mystery may never be solved,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tourists Ondra Hadras and Lucie Minarikova could not have imagined they would land jobs feeding emus and crocodiles in one of Australia's smallest outback towns, infamous for a dark mystery that may never be solved. Then, mere moments after touching down in the Northern Territory – thousands of kilometres from their Czech Republic home country, they were swept off to Larrimah – a dot on the Stuart Highway with no schools, petrol stations, restaurants or even a grocery store. Population, fewer than 11. ""When we got here the internet connection was very poor, we didn't know about the history of the town, or about the missing persons case,"" Lucie said. ""We're used to travelling around to different places, so we just packed our bags and headed here to work."" The couple planned to stay for a fleeting few weeks as the newest publicans of the Pink Panther Hotel to earn some extra money on their travels. But then the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, trapping them for far longer than expected. They became parents just a couple of months ago when they welcomed the first baby born in Larrimah in more than two decades. Mathew's birth single-handedly grew the population by about 10 per cent and significantly lowered the median age of a town where residents are closer to 100. ""It's a one-in-a-million story,"" Ondra said. ""This is something which not many people do … our family can't even imagine [what it's like] when we tell them all the things we do. ""When Mathew grows up, we'll be telling him he grew up next to a crocodile cage, in a really special place."" In a town where every single resident now gathers together for Christmas, and most convene at the Pink Panther Pub for an end-of-day beer about 5pm, Mathew ""gets a lot of attention,"" Ondra said. But attention is not out of the ordinary for the residents of Larrimah, who are now accustomed to news crews rolling into town, documentary teams settling in for a couple of weeks and ongoing police probes. A coronial inquest into the missing persons case of Larrimah larrikin Paddy Moriarty, who disappeared without a trace in 2017, last month found he was dead. Even without a body, coroner Greg Cavenagh said he believed Mr Moriarty's colourful life came to an end in suspicious circumstances. ""Paddy was killed in the context of and likely due to the ongoing feud he had with his nearest neighbours,"" he stated in his official findings handed down in April. The case has captured global attention, yet remains unsolved despite a probing book and a podcast. These days, if asked to describe their hometown, most of Larrimah's residents do not hesitate to say it's nearing its demise, even with the most recent population explosion. ""We're all in our 70s and 80s now … we'll all die out eventually,"" long-term resident Karl Roth said. But it hasn't always been that way. During World War II, about 10,000 troops were stationed at Larrimah and years later it served as a railhead until the line closed in 1976. ""It was never a big town … when we first moved here the population was about 28, including kids, but all the stations would come in back in those days,"" Mr Roth said. ""This place used to hum on a Friday, Saturday night."" For Ondra and Lucie, the quietness of Larrimah was a major selling point, and as the sole managers of the ageing hotel, they are usually run off their feet keeping a zoo of animals alive and catering to the flocks of grey nomads on their travels around Australia. ""It gets really crazy with the tourists here during the dry season,"" Lucie said. ""We are the chef, the waiter, the cleaner. We do it all."" Ondra and Lucie say they would look back on the journey as a once-in-a-life-time experience. They have no plans to leave just yet. ""There is something about this place. We have emus that stick their heads in our rooms in the morning,"" Lucie said. ""We never liked the big cities … but for me this is more like an interesting extreme, where you will live for a period of time … and we plan to stay for a few more years."" She said it was not a job where she went into an office and sat for eight hours. ""When you work here you go and feed Sam the crocodile, and the emus, and our parrots, and long-billed corella,"" she said. ""For people from [the] Czech Republic, that's pretty special.""

7,'Perfect storm': Staff shortages threaten Top End tourist season ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Standing in the gleaming lobby of the major Darwin hotel he manages, Markus Kaliss says this dry season has the potential to attract a record number of bookings for the venue – if only he could find enough staff. ""At the moment we're not fully booked, but there's already now days and weeks where we're saying 'you know what, that's it, we don't sell more because we can't handle [it], unless we find staff',"" Mr Kaliss said. ""So we are now capping capacity, simply for staffing reasons."" Mr Kaliss is not alone. The pandemic has brought a challenging two years for businesses, and Mr Kalliss's hotel is one of countless hotels, restaurants and bars across Australia struggling to meet demand due to staff shortages. But while the problem is nation-wide, it's threatening to have a particularly severe impact in the Top End, as it enters its peak tourist season this month. Mr Kaliss said it was a ""tough time"" for territory hospitality businesses, which were also grappling with existing staff taking time off after catching COVID-19 or leaving due to the territory government's wide-ranging vaccine mandate. ""We've never seen this shortage of labour that we need here,"" he said. Alex Bruce, the head of the Territory's peak hospitality industry body, said Top End businesses were bracing for strong demand this dry season, especially from interstate. But with few international visitors in Australia – including prospective workers – and a large number of former domestic staff having left the industry for other sectors during the pandemic, Mr Bruce said the staffing situation was dire. ""What we're hearing now from people that have travelled over to South-east Asia, is a lot of people that were working in the tourism and hospitality industry in those countries, they've moved into other industries as well,"" he said. ""So we're facing a bit of a perfect storm – we don't have enough domestic local workers, and we don't have enough international workers coming back online now."" Mr Bruce said the crisis was having serious impacts on hospitality businesses, which were still trying to recover from a difficult few years during the pandemic. ""You're seeing restaurants unable to open during the day, during the week, even though the demand is there,"" he said. ""We are hearing that some of the hotels around town can't get all their rooms online. ""So it's still a great time to get out and about – the weather's never better — and you'll still get a good experience in our venues, but the tip is this year, to plan and book, and book early."" Martin Bouchier, the owner and chef of a restaurant in Darwin said the current staff shortage at his business made the dry season a ""scary"" prospect. ""There's just not the [staff] around to be able to accommodate the people that want to come into the town as tourists,"" he said. ""So we're bringing people into the CBD, into Darwin and into the Northern Territory, and yet there's not the backpackers or the international students or the working group to keep us going."" Today Tourism and Hospitality Minister Natasha Fyles announced more funding for the territory's tourism industry, ahead of the delivery of the 2022 NT budget tomorrow. It includes $1.3 million for attracting and retaining tourism staff and $1 million for marketing to international students, as well as $14.2 million for generally promoting the NT over the next year. Mr Bruce said the initiatives were welcome, with international students making up ""a core part of the hospitality workforce"". However, he said a range of measures were needed to help solve the sector's staffing crisis, including fast-tracking work visas, easing working hour limits for international students, and even the NT government scrapping its worker vaccine mandate. ""It's not just when the borders open we can flick a switch and get everybody back,"" Mr Bruce said. ""We're on a three-year rebuild for our workers.""

8,Search begins for 'good people' to take over remote island resort,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Sweers Island Resort hits market for $3.95m as owners vow 'good people' will take it over For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Known among anglers as a fishers' paradise, the pristine Sweers Island Resort in the Gulf of Carpentaria has hit the market at $3.95 million. Its reputation for world-class fishing, resort accommodation and pristine beaches means more than 900 accommodation nights have already been booked by tourists for 2022. Thomas, better known as Tex, and Lyn Battle have held the perpetual lease, on the land of the Kaiadilt people, for the past 34 years. While interest in the island is high, the couple say it will take a special type of buyer to seal the deal. ""It's been a hard decision to sell up. We've been here for 34 years but my date of birth has caught up to me and we've realised we have to sell,"" Mr Battle said. ""We've already said no to a few developer-types, that's definitely not what we want. ""Our ambition is to have good people take it over. ""We want someone who is going to love this place as much as we have and who is going to maybe invest in a few upgrades. A chef would be nice, for example."" Along with its own private airstrip, accommodation, fishing charter facilities, liquor licence, mobile and internet, the resort is the only tourist hotspot in the region. Private Islands Online's Richard Vanhoff said many potential buyers had already shown interest. ""No other land for lease will be made available on any islands within the Gulf of Carpentaria for the use as resort business, so no competition,"" Mr Vanhoff said. ""The phones have been running hot since it got out there and most of the inquiries have come from groups of people."" Mr Battle said it was a ""walk in, walk out"" sale. ""If someone buys it, they get everything we have here. Cabins, workshops, machinery, everything,"" he said. As the couple prepares to depart the island at the end of the year, they say the biggest highlight of managing the getaway has been the people they have encountered over the years. ""We've met everyone from council workers to millionaires. They're all the same when they're here. They come here to enjoy themselves,"" he said. ""The highlights have simply been visits from nice people or seeing people return year after year and enjoy themselves. ""It's a special place, and while we are sad to leave it, rest assured we will be visiting again.""

9,"Jetstar to fly directly from Canberra to Melbourne, Gold Coast",travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Jetstar expands direct flights to and from Canberra to include Melbourne and Gold Coast For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Jetstar is adding two new routes to its Canberra service with direct flights to and from both Melbourne and the Gold Coast. The budget carrier, owned by Qantas, entered the Canberra market in December with flights to and from Brisbane. Now Jetstar has announced that daily flights to Melbourne will begin on July 1, with the Gold Coast service starting in mid-September. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said Jetstar's Brisbane-Canberra route had proven successful over the past five months, with more than 80 per cent of seats sold. ""This is a real vote of confidence from Jetstar in the Canberra market,"" he said. ""It's going to work both ways for us: it's going to be great for Canberrans who want to get to the Gold Coast or down to Melbourne. ""But it's also going to open the door for thousands of extra tourists to be able to get to Canberra in an affordable way."" While new flights might make it easier for Canberrans to enjoy a Melbourne or Gold Coast getaway, it is the potential influx of inbound visitors that the ACT government and tourism operators are focusing on. ""Visit Canberra will work with Jetstar on cooperative marketing campaigns to promote the new services,"" Mr Barr said. ""Melbourne is our second biggest inbound market after Sydney, so it's going to be an easy opportunity for us to grow our Victorian tourism and particularly short-break tourism over weekends. ""Now to have four airlines flying [to Melbourne] and competing, really is fantastic news. ""One of the challenges for us is that it's often been cheaper to fly to Bali or to other parts of Australia than it has been to fly into Canberra, so this is a game-changer for us."" Canberra Region Tourism Industry Council chief executive, Naomi Dale, agreed the new services would ""make a big difference"". ""It really gives us access to a whole new set of people who otherwise would not make the time to travel to Canberra,"" she said. ""Just the way that Canberra is perceived as an expensive place to visit or travel to, it will make a huge difference having access to that budget airline."" Mr Barr also said Canberra was ""edging closer"" to the return of international flights, with talks ongoing with Australian and overseas carriers. ""Piece by piece we are rebuilding the aviation network out of Canberra,"" he said. ""We'll have some further announcements, we hope, in the months ahead."" Canberra Airport chief executive Stephen Byron offered further details, saying Qatar Airways had been set to resume daily flights to Canberra but a shortage of planes had forced them to delay the restart. He said the airport was also in close contact with Singapore Airlines. ""I was up in Singapore a couple of weeks ago talking to Singapore Airlines and it's very much on their radar as international travel picks up,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mr Byron said mask-wearing in the airport terminal was still being heavily policed, despite restrictions continuing to ease across the country. He said he hoped the airport's mask mandates would be lifted mid-week. ""What amazes me is it's taken 10 weeks already,"" he said. ""You can be in a nightclub for four or five hours and dance until 3am and drink and stand up, and none of that needs a mask, then surely sitting quietly in an airport lounge cannot be more dangerous than that.""

10,Russians to be deported from Bali for obscene Instagram content,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency It's known as the Island of the Gods, but that's lost on some Western influencers who like its picturesque temples and landscapes for risque social media content. Russian yogi influencer Alina Fazleeva and her husband, Andrey, will be deported and barred from entering Indonesia for six months, after Ms Fazleeva offended Balinese Hindus by posting images of herself posing naked on a centuries-old sacred tree. Known as Kayu Putih, which translates as ""white wood"", the giant tree behind Babakan Temple in Bali's Tabanan district is believed by locals to be 700 years old. The image went viral after Niluh Djelantik — a prominent Balinese fashion designer and politician — posted a screenshot asking people to report Alina to immigration authorities and the police. ""She should be responsible for the cost of the cleaning ceremony to be carried out by villagers,"" Ms Djelantik said. ""Trashy tourist. Go home!"" she later posted. Ms Fazleeva deleted the offensive post and published another photo depicting herself offering prayers while clothed at the same tree. ""I apologise to all the people of Bali and Indonesia. I regret what I have done,"" she wrote in Indonesian. ""I am so ashamed, I did not mean to offend you in any way, I had no knowledge of this place,"" she said. ""I just prayed under the tree and went straight to the police station to explain this and apologise."" Despite the apology, Bali's Governor, Wayan Koster, personally ordered her deportation, saying in a statement it was ""far important to preserve the culture and respect the dignity of Bali"" than tolerate such behaviour for tourist dollars. Ravinjay Kuckreja researches indigenous religion at the State Hindu University of Denpasar in Bali and hosts the Being Bali podcast on local culture. He said that, for Balinese Hindus, ""sources of water like springs, statues, trees and volcanoes are amongst the many everyday objects that are sanctified and regarded as sacred"". Having one's naked body against a holy tree was thus considered ""sacrilege"" by Balinese Hindus, who revere large trees as embodying ""a divine ogre named Banaspati Raja (lord of the forests)"", Mr Kuckreja said. ""The tree is completely sacred ... it is considered a manifestation of God,"" he said. The incident came shortly after immigration officials said they would deport a Canadian man who had filmed himself attempting the ceremonial Māori Haka on a volcano worshipped by Balinese Hindus. Jeffrey Craigen, a self-described ""mind body healer"", live-streamed himself dancing, naked, on the peak of Mt Batur while proclaiming that stripping naked made him into a ""fearless child of God"". Mr Kuckreja said that dancing naked at Mt Batur was considered even worse than posing naked on the tree, because the volcano was ""exceptionally sacred"" for Balinese Hindus. Jamaruli Manihuruk, the immigration head in Bali, said locals across the province were urged to ""proactively monitor and report various violations committed by foreigners to authorities [so that they can take] strict action"". Neither Ms Fazleeva nor Mr Craigen responded to requests for comment. Such incidents are not new in Bali. In August 2019 — shortly before the pandemic devastated the local tourism industry — a Czech couple uploaded a video of themselves splashing holy water on intimate body parts during a visit to a Hindu temple complex. Another video recently circulated on Indonesian social media appears to show a Caucasian man masturbating under a waterfall in Bali. The island welcomed more than six million international travellers in 2019. With Indonesia's borders largely closed due to COVID-19 in 2021, however, Bali saw only around 50 foreign tourists for the whole year. Bali is welcoming back most international tourists, including Australians, without a requirement to quarantine. Other holiday destinations in South-East Asia are also scrapping restrictions for foreign travellers. Direct international flights to the island resumed in February 2022 and fully vaccinated travellers are no longer required to quarantine upon arrival. With life approaching normal and an influx of foreigners to Bali, so returns tourists behaving badly. ""Balinese culture, Balinese ancestral beliefs, and Hinduism, are one in everyday life in Bali,"" said AA Ngurah Adi Ardhana, a local MP and deputy head of the Indonesian Association of Hotels and Restaurants in Bali. He said tourists came to Bali for many reasons and that authorities needed to be prepared for such incidents by educating foreigners about local customs and maintaining the sanctity of holy sites. ""Preventing it is far better than having to repeat it and causing disturbances to this sanctity,"" Mr Ardhana told the ABC. Hindus account for some 90 per cent of Bali's population and around 2 per cent of the total population of Indonesia — a Muslim-majority country where religion is fundamental to identity and plays a major role in cultural and political life. A 2020 Pew survey found 98 per cent of Indonesians said religion was ""very important"" to their lives, compared to just 18 per cent of people in Australia. It was one of Bali’s best kept secrets, then tourism boomed. Now COVID has forced locals back to nature. Blasphemy is illegal in Indonesia, with most high-profile cases consisting of a member of a minority religion offending Muslims. Jakarta's former Christian governor, Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama, was controversially jailed in 2017 for supposedly blaspheming Islam. Mr Kuckreja said that, while Balinese Hindus rarely had the opportunity to claim blasphemy against members of the Muslim community, in the case of foreigners, it was different. ""It's about getting their rights, about getting respect,"" he said. Indonesia's Tourism Minister, Sandiaga Uno, said recently that he was keen to promote traditional culture via ""tourism villages"" to international visitors in Bali for the G20 conference in November. Mr Kuckreja said that within Balinese culture, visitors from other parts of Indonesia and from overseas were considered ""guests"" and thus treated with the island's famous hospitality. ""It becomes really weird when the guest would then do something obscene … It's kind of misusing the hospitality that they are giving to guests."" It is not difficult to identify holy places in Bali, he said, given that trees and other objects were usually adorned with offerings and ceremonial cloth. ""[Tourists] should really understand that they are guests and they don't own everything. Before they want to do something, just ask,"" Mr Kuckreja said. ""It's just so much more polite to ask, 'Hey, can I hug your tree naked?' and get an appropriate response.""

12,The small island near Australia promising to be the new Great Barrier Reef mixed with Bali,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  East Timor's coral reefs are the most biodiverse in the world. Why are they surviving climate change? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Luis Melky Here-Huno — or Melky as he is known around here —  is East Timor's first qualified diving instructor. We meet in Dili, where Melky is teaching more than 40 Timorese kids how to swim and introducing them to diving theory, before taking them on their first dive. For most of these children, Melky's lessons are their introduction to East Timor's stunning coral reefs, recognised as the most biodiverse in the world. ""I want to keep teaching Timorese people to dive and help them understand what is down in our ocean so we Timorese people can learn to take care of our coral reefs,"" he says. The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste is one of the world's youngest nations, gaining its independence and officially changing its name in 2002, after a brutal war with Indonesia. From its inception, the tiny nation has sought to project itself as an eco-tourism alternative to Indonesia's island of Bali, 2,000 kilometres west. But as Timor-Leste reopens to the world post-COVID a key challenge remains: how can its pristine natural environment be maintained while building sustainable livelihoods for locals like Melky? ""Everyone is talking about climate change here — people are worried about the future of the reefs,"" Melky says. ""I know what is inside the ocean here now — and if the coral reef is dying we won't have an industry."" Melky, 30, grew up in Dili close to the ocean, and spent much of his childhood at the beach. He never dreamed he would one day make a living as a dive teacher, but he recently won a tourism champion award for his efforts. He was just 10 years old when the war ended and has vivid memories of huddling at the port in Dili, waiting for the United Nations peacekeepers to arrive to provide protection from occupying Indonesian forces. ""So many people had died but for young people at the time we felt very happy,"" he says. ""Timor-Leste is very small but at least we are independent."" Melky's first job was collecting garbage in Dili. Then he worked as a security guard watching the cars of divers while they went out on diving trips. ""While I waited for them, I used to wonder what they were doing down there under water,"" he says. His lucky break came when he met Kate Barker and Ivan Samra, the British and Mexican co-owners of a dive school, and began working with them in 2016 as he trained to become a dive instructor. ""I want tourism to become much bigger in Timor-Leste, but not so it becomes like the next Bali,"" he says. ""In Bali you can see the beaches are covered in rubbish and it's just too commercial. We want more tourism, but we want it to be more natural and environmentally friendly."" Melky is not the only one with a passion for preserving Timor-Leste's environment. Catherine Kim grew up in the suburbs of Washington DC, a long way from the coral reefs of Timor-Leste. ""I first heard of the coral reefs in Timor-Leste in the first year of my PhD at the University of Queensland when the project I was working on planned a field trip there,"" she says. ""To be quite honest I wasn't at all familiar with Timor-Leste as a country but I was drawn to it in part because it was newly independent. In that regard I felt there was a lot to tell people about this tiny new country with amazing coral reefs."" Over four field trips between August 2014 and October 2019, Dr Kim contributed to the most comprehensive surveys of Timor-Leste's reefs ever undertaken. Together with data from XL Catlin Seaview Survey and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the research results underpinned her PhD thesis. Part of Dr Kim's research focuses on the island of Atauro, 30 kilometres north of Dili, which boasts extraordinary coral reef habitats and associated marine biodiversity, including endangered, threatened and protected marine megafauna. ""It is part of the Coral Triangle which is the marine epicentre of biodiversity,"" she says. ""These reefs are recognised as the most biodiverse reefs in the world. So part of my interest in studying them is a belief that this is something people really should know about."" Dr Kim's research used data from water temperature and detailed reef surveys to confirm that the tiny country's coral reefs were remarkably high in biodiversity. She further discovered that Timor-Leste's reefs — which sit on the southern edge of the Coral Triangle, an area of ocean stretching from Papua New Guinea to the Philippines and down to Indonesia — appeared to have lower levels of bleaching compared with other reefs such as Australia's Great Barrier Reef. ""What I found from those surveys taken during the rainy season in Timor was that the temperature was a couple of degrees cooler than the satellites were picking up,"" says Dr Kim. ""That was interesting because those bleaching forecasts are based on satellite data of surface temperature. But [for a coral reef] a single degree of difference is quite significant. So despite the satellite predicting bleaching based on satellite data the actual temperature was below that."" Although ocean temperatures are usually warmest after summer (April in the southern hemisphere), Dr Kim's research shows that the waters in Timor-Leste were cooler than predicted when the potential for bleaching events were at their highest. ""One of my key findings was that Timor-Leste could be viewed as a climate refugium in terms of ocean warming and climate change,"" she says. ""That cooler temperature is a significant protective factor against bleaching. So I found that while there is bleaching occurring in Timor Leste, those reefs have a bit more of a buffer in terms of ocean warming."" Dr Kim says if current warming trends continue, most of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef will be gone within a century but the reefs of Atauro may remain in a similar state if other threats are properly managed. ""We cannot underestimate the myriad of threats that impact coral reefs,"" she says. ""Ocean acidification, land-based pollution, overfishing and unsustainable human activities [are some of them]. Dealing with these issues needs to coincide with managing the most significant variable threat to reef health, which is climate change."" For the nascent diving industry in Timor-Leste, there is hope that tourists and divers will be drawn to the remarkable coral wonderland in Atauro before it's too late. ""Part of the reason I have a business in Timor-Leste is to support the local people and try to do things differently,"" says Ivan Samra, co-owner of the Dreamers Dive Academy Timor and President of the Marine Tourism Association of Timor Leste. ""But I am not naive. Coral reefs are dying right now all over the world. Look at the Great Barrier Reef, the Cayman Islands and the Pacific Ocean. ""I am 30 years old but we speak about it every day because we are very aware that by 2040 or 2050 tropical reefs may not exist. Just by its oceanographic conditions and sheer luck, Timor Leste may be one of the last places with coral reefs left in the world within the next decades."" Today, Timor-Leste is positioning itself as an eco-tourist destination that boasts a relatively untouched natural environment compared to neighbouring Bali. Nick Hitchins, who pilots emergency support and tourism flights between Dili and Atauro Island, says the plan – while exciting — poses significant challenges. As well as its impressive coral reefs, Atauro Island is also home to some of the world's poorest people, Hitchins says. ""The challenge facing the Island and the rest of Timor-Leste is how to balance environmental impact with the need for survival in its rawest sense."" While flying the the 30-kilometre stretch between Dili and Atouro in a tiny Australian made Gipps Aero GA8 plane, Hitchins explains a modest $2 ""reef-tax"" levied on all visitors is designed to help offset the fact that locals are now not allowed to fish in protected waters. ""This goes some way to providing alternative means of livelihood,"" Hitchins says. But there is a greater challenge remaining, he says. ""We must ensure that it's not just the world's wealthy who benefit from local tourism and that our Western environmental ideals don't inadvertently worsen the plight of those living in extremely isolated, impoverished societies,"" he says. One of the ways Atauro is seeking to balance environmental and economic outcomes is through Tara Bandu, an animistic spiritual belief that uses traditional laws to manage natural resources. ""Our ancestors used Tara Bandu to protect our most sacred natural places including the fish, animals and important species,"" says Osaias Soares, president of the Atauro Marine Tourism Association. ""It taught people that if we go slow and tread lightly the environment will benefit us. So now we are applying Tara Bundu to our marine protected areas."" Soares says that when he was growing up on Atauro Island there were many more seabirds and animals, but their numbers have dwindled over the past two decades. ""There are only a few seabirds left now, not like when I was a little boy,"" he says. ""Atauro used to focus more on agricultural production and livestock but because of the failure of agriculture to thrive here people switched to focusing on marine shallow water industries in the reef area."" Soares studied marine biology in New Zealand and has brought that knowledge back to Atauro to work with local tourism operators and marine conservation groups. ""We need to teach our local Timorese people about the science of the oceans and reefs here,"" he says. ""Maybe they will tell the tourists about the life of giant clams and how they reproduce. Then they take people into the Marine Protected Area and show them the clams."" Soares knows Atauro is not immune to the threats from climate change. Coral bleaching would be a disaster for his tiny island because of its reliance on marine activities. ""We have one of the most beautiful natural resources in the world here and we are doing our best to take care of the marine area,"" he says as we walk along Beloi beach with the coral reefs just metres away. ""In order to keep it we ask Australia, China, America and other countries that rely on carbon production to find an alternative. Please help us in Atauro and Timor Leste because we want to protect our environment so the world can enjoy them with us."" James Norman flew to Atauro courtesy mission aviation fellowship.

14,Ball gowns and woolly slippers: Regional Queensland heats up for winter,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Regional Queensland tourism ready for winter boost as events coincide with cool weather For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Ball gowns and woolly slippers are emerging from cupboards across southwest Queensland as the temperature drops and a busy events calendar heats up. The outback conjures images of hot red sand and temperatures soaring past 40C. But winter in southern and south west Queensland can routinely get down to freezing — not that cold weather will stop a good party. Charleville business owner Courtney Bylett said the region's social season kicked off as the mercury fell. ""We've got races, cultural shows, football season and gymkhanas — mate anything you want, we've got it out here,"" Ms Bylett said. The Charleville Show's ball is being held on Friday night for the first time in several years, bringing a crowd and heralding the start of a busy event season that will have plenty of locals booked out for weekends with no break in sight. ""You'd think we'd all start hibernating [when it gets cold] but none of that bothers us,"" Ms Bylett said. ""Give us a jacket, give us a fire drum, give us a couple of cold rums and a jumper and we're good to go."" Southern parts of Queensland are expected to experience cool weather in coming days as a high pressure system in the Great Australian Bight directs air from the Southern Ocean across southeast Australia. Weather bureau forecaster Shane Kennedy said the cool change would be followed by a rise in temperatures by next Tuesday. ""The coldest places [in Queensland] are most likely to be the Granite Belt and parts of the Southern Interior near the New South Wales border, so looking south of Cunnamulla,"" he said. ""Those temperatures are likely to be well below 10C at night, and getting down to 5 or 6 on Saturday and Sunday morning."" He said that was fairly close to the May average in the Darling Downs but getting up 3 and 4C below average in the Maranoa and Warrego district. Mr Kennedy said the winter was forecasted to be warmer than average. ""It's likely to be the coolest morning of the year for many parts of the Southern Inland area over the next couple of days, particularly the weekend,"" he said. A dusting of snow is a common sight for Queensland's coldest town, Stanthorpe. It's not only residents who enjoy the cooler weather, but tourists who make the journey up from the southern states after two years locked out. Granite Belt Wine Tourism president Martin Cooper said tourists loved the colder weather. ""It's frantic,"" Mr Cooper said. ""People love to come out in beanies, scarves, gloves and parkers."" Mr Cooper also owns and runs a winery which has cabins as accommodation amongst the vineyard. ""Between our accommodation we estimate we're going to use about 22 tonne of firewood this winter and we've been organising the supply for the last two months,"" he said. ""We've got heaps of piles of firewood ready to put next to our cabins every night."" Mr Cooper has a few words of advice to ensure a positive holiday as smaller towns experience a huge influx of tourists and caravans. ""Make your bookings,"" he said. ""Restaurants are filling up, the accommodation is filling up and you don't want to be disappointed, so get your bookings in."" Ms Bylett said patience was also appreciated as tourists made their way west. ""[Tourists] are very much welcome,"" she said. ""Sometimes it's a bit unfortunate we don't have a lot of cafes to offer to them."" She said tourist season could be a bit overwhelming in small towns. ""Be patient with us, but we're doing our best to work towards what you guys [tourists] need."" ABC Western Qld will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Tuesday.

15,Which flights will Qantas beat to take the world's-longest-haul title?,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas will break records with Sydney-to-London haul. Here are the some of the longest-duration flights in the world For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Qantas has revealed plans for the world's longest-duration commercial flight by the end of 2025, ferrying passengers between Sydney and London on Airbus A350s in just over 19 hours. Only a handful of airlines fly non-stop over such vast distances, feats that present a host of challenges, including the capability of planes, commercial viability and even the health of crew and passengers. Here are some of the longest-duration flights in the world today: Singapore Airlines Flight SQ24 to New York's John F Kennedy International airport is currently the longest commercial journey in the world, taking passengers more than 15,000 kilometres from the city-state to the eastern United States on Airbus A350-900s. It also operates the second-longest journey – Flight SQ22, also on A350-900s, to Newark in the US state of New Jersey, which is scheduled at 18 hours and 25 minutes. Qantas will use the A350-1000 variant for its planned Sydney-London flights. The longest current Qantas route – QF9 – connects Darwin in northern Australia with London daily, with passengers covering almost 14,000km on Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Its flights were originally operated between London and Perth, but were moved to Darwin because of Australia's COVID-19 travel restrictions. Qantas has said it will resume its Perth-to-London route this year. Singapore Airlines Flight SQ35 takes passengers more than 14,000km over the Pacific Ocean, from Los Angeles on the US West Coast to the Asian city-state in 17 hours and 10 minutes. The carrier's San Francisco-Singapore flight is scheduled at 16 hours and 40 minutes. Cathay Pacific said in March that it was planning to alter its New York-to-Hong Kong route over the Atlantic instead of over the Pacific Ocean, making it a longer journey than Singapore Airlines Flight SQ24 to JFK. The flight path will cover ""just under 9,000 nautical miles"" (16,668km) in 16 to 17 hours, the airline told AFP in a statement. It declined to be drawn on why its flight path gave a wide berth to Russia's airspace, which it has previously flown through, according to Bloomberg. Many airlines have cancelled routes to Russian cities or are avoiding Russian airspace over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Cathay Pacific said the decision was taken because ""strong seasonal tailwinds"" made the new route more favourable.

16,Queensland state school students caught up in international travel ban,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Queensland state school students have been unable to attend international events due to an education department ban on overseas travel, despite open borders. In March 2020, Queensland Education Minister Grace Grace banned international travel for state school staff and students due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While Australia's international borders reopened after two years in February this year, the ban on government school staff and students remains in place. Independent schools are not bound by the department's ban. The department's restriction has prevented two teams of students from Brisbane State High School, who won a national linguistics competition, from travelling to the Isle of Man to compete at the International Linguistics Olympiad. Additionally, students from Mountain Creek State High School, Merrimac State High School and Worongary State High School were prevented from going to compete at the 2022 VEX World Robotics Championship the United States this week after they qualified at the national level. In a social media post praising some of the students ""incredible results"" the department of education said they would be joining the competition online due to travel restrictions. Tory, a mother of one Brisbane State High School student unable to travel for the competition, told ABC Radio Brisbane they were initially excited at the opportunity for Ben and the team to represent their school. She said she had spent the past 10 days trying to find out when the ban would be lifted from both Education Queensland and Queensland Health. ""I understand why the ban was brought in and you know, I appreciate that it's been really difficult times,"" she said. ""However, now obviously, international travel is open to private citizens and Education Queensland is actively encouraging international students to come and study here. ""So I just wanted to find out when the ban would be lifted to see whether we could accept the invitation and start booking tickets."" She said she suspected the ban would be lifted soon but she said ""trying to find out when the ban would be lifted has been a really fraught exercise and I don't have an answer"". An education department spokesperson said the department was working through ""issues related to COVID insurance and other matters"" to lift the restrictions ""as soon as it is responsible to do so"". ""On Queensland Health advice and in line with the Declared Public Health Emergencies, and during a world health pandemic, as at 15 March 2020, all departmental international student and staff travel was put on hold until further notice,"" the spokesperson said. ""The safety of students and staff who travel overseas will always be our number one priority, and we will always follow the health advice."" A Queensland Health spokesperson said the health advice in March 2020 and throughout the pandemic was appropriate at the time. ""The Department of Education can provide comment on policies they may have put in place during the pandemic for staff, students and teachers,"" the spokesperson said. Education Minister Grace Grace declined an interview with ABC News.

17,Planning a European holiday? It will cost more and take longer to get a passport,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Travel agents say Australians who are planning a European holiday this year should expect to pay 25 per cent more for their trip than pre-COVID prices. Despite the opening of international borders, flight capacity is still limited and the tourism industry is dealing with a staffing shortage. Flight Centre CEO Graham Turner said recent interest in international travel had been ""huge"" and the industry was struggling to attract enough staff. Mr Turner said a lack of airline capacity, especially out of Queensland, was also a major problem. ""The reality is, if you want to go to Europe in summer, late June, July, August, you need to get in quickly because there's just not enough seats,"" he said. ""And it'll be more expensive than pre-COVID, probably about 20-25 per cent more expensive."" Flight Centre had 21,000 staff globally before COVID but its workforce now is only about half that. Mr Turner said an industry-wide staff shortage and an increase in demand for bookings had led to  ""queues out the door"" at some travel agents. ""There's a lot of pent-up demand,"" he said. ""We're back to 60 or 70 per cent of the pre COVID traffic so there's a lot of pressure on our people, our frontline people, which is one of the things that is a worry for us. ""All we want is more airline capacity, and we need more people to help our customers out as well. ""Because obviously, inevitably customer service will suffer a bit, or a lot in the odd case."" Australian travellers are also being warned of delays to passport processing. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said following the reopening of Australia’s international border it had experienced high demand for passport services. Between January and March this year, DFAT issued about 390,000 passports – more than double the number it issued over the same period in 2021. ""Due to the high demand, passport applications are currently taking longer to process,"" the spokesperson said. DFAT said travellers should allow at least six weeks for passports processing. ""Current processing times are, on average, 17 business days,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is well short of the time frame the department is encouraging customers to renew their passport."" Gold Coast Airport CEO Chris Mills said last month's passenger numbers were close to the previous April record set during the Commonwealth Games in 2018. ""When we recorded those numbers a couple of years ago international traffic was well and truly a key part of our business,"" he said. ""So to see these sorts of numbers we're achieving just short of pre-COVID levels without international traffic is a really good sign."" Despite the ongoing staffing issues, Mr Mills said the airport was coping with operational challenges. ""We've demonstrated we can manage these large numbers and keep people moving to their destination,"" he said. Flight Centre says it is hoping to open another 50 offices as soon as it can find enough staff. ""The shops are all kept up to date but we just don't have the staff to open those last 50 or so at the moment,"" Mr Turner said. ""Over the next six months, we'll be building up our staff numbers. ""I think the [airline] capacity will be pretty much back to normal for the Christmas holidays. ""We're pretty confident we'll get back to be able to really look after customers over the next two or three months, look after people really well.""

18,Brisbane's Rivergate Marina secures approval for $200m superyacht expansion ,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Brisbane's Rivergate Marina secures approval for $200m superyacht expansion For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Brisbane could welcome dozens more luxury superyachts annually, becoming a major industry hub in the Asia Pacific after Brisbane City Council recently approved Rivergate Marina's $200 million superyacht expansion plan. The multi-million-dollar project will see Rivergate's existing marina expand into the largest superyacht hub in the region, able to accommodate up to 60 superyachts per year for maintenance and retrofitting. Rivergate Marina director Tom Hill said the flow-on effects of attracting more superyachts to Queensland would have big impacts on the local tourism economy. ""We had an overseas boat with us last year and the year before, and the weekly charter for this vessel was in the millions, and the flow-on effect for this boat being in our waters for a bit over a week was $2.5 million,"" Mr Hill said. The marina has been operating since 2006 but anticipates its expansion plans — mostly funded by the company but with hopes of government contributions — will significantly boost its ability to service luxury yachts. A $31 million ship lift that can move 90-metre-long yachts of up to 3,000 tonnes in weight is a key feature of the 27,878m² development, which will be staged over two sections. ""Picture a large superyacht coming into the Brisbane River and getting lifted up on a large boat trailer, being put onto a hardstand here where thousands of employees will be working on these boats,” Mr Hill said. ""Whilst the boat will be up on a hardstand, or in a purpose-built refit shed, the crew and the captain and the owner will be able to stay at our trade centre, a five-storey building on-site with amenities … a pool, a bar.” Mr Hill said the massive ship lift would also offer some defence capability, allowing the company to work on some Defence vessels. The project will be constructed in two stages, with the second stage a five-storey trade building with offices, training rooms and 14 short-term crew accommodation units. At Tuesday's city planning committee meeting, councillors were given details of the development application made by Rivergate Marina and its potential economic impact on the city. Three 35-metre-tall sheds will be built to house superyachts undergoing retrofitting, while hardstand capacity for 10 vessels and two water service berths will also be constructed. The project is anticipated to host 433 jobs during construction, putting $154.6 million into local business, and host 1,458 jobs post-construction, with $525 million injected into the local tourism economy. City planning committee chair Adam Allan said the ""multifaceted"" development would ""put Brisbane on the map"" in the superyacht industry. In April last year, industry body Superyacht Australia reported Australia's domestic superyacht industry had doubled in size during the pandemic, with border closures prompting a spike in charters and holidays aboard the luxury vessels. Superyachts have been a target market for Queensland for several years with the state government releasing a five-year superyacht strategy in 2018, aiming to become the key superyacht hub in the Asia Pacific. The superyacht industry was predicted to contribute more than $1.1 billion to the gross state product, with nearly 8,000 full-time-equivalent jobs in south-east Queensland by 2021. On the Gold Coast, a $9 million superyacht berth was opened in February at the Southport Yacht Club, backed by the state government, described by Mayor Tom Tate as a ""red-carpet moment"" for the city. A superyacht mooring trail announced by the state government for the Brisbane River, which could have conflicted with the Kangaroo Point Green Bridge, was put on hold during the pandemic.

19,Private landowners yet to approve Parnkalla Trail upgrade along Port Lincoln foreshore,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Parnkalla Trail upgrades hope to link Axel Stenross Museum in safer Port Lincoln foreshore walk For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Negotiations are ongoing between private landowners and the Port Lincoln City Council over proposed upgrades to the popular Parnkalla Trail. If approved by property owners the foreshore walk from the Lincoln Hotel will be extended through to the Limani Hotel. Council CEO Matthew Morgan said discussions with home owners have been ongoing since 2016. ""We're dealing with various different landowners including private landowners and government landowners,"" he said. ""We [already] have full government permission to utilise the coastal path from the Limani to Axel Stenross. ""[But with] the Limani through to the foreshore there are various different private landowners. If they agree we will go coastal; if they don't agree then we will go roadside."" This week the incumbent Member for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, announced $6.8 million to upgrade parts of the Parnkalla Trail if he is re-elected this month. The upgrade is phase 3 of City of Port Lincoln's Foreshore Redevelopment Project. The council has already begun works along the foreshore earlier this year as part of phase 2 of the project. Mr Ramsey said the trail was an important part of the city's attraction and said that both locals and tourists would enjoy the upgrades. ""I think we will see a lot more of the locals getting out to exercise in the morning, going for a walk, going for a run, all those things. And it will be great for the Port Lincoln community,"" he said. ""I think it's a really, really important part. The frontage of Port Lincoln is one of the delights of the place, it's a great tourist attraction."" The trail was formally developed in 1986 and follows the coastline around Boston Bay, providing visitors and locals with the opportunity to enjoy the views of the coastline. In 2008, the council developed a Parnkalla Trail Strategy, identifying key aspects of the path that needed upgrading. Mr Morgan said the upgrades were needed urgently between the Limani Hotel and the Axel Stenross Museum close to the highway as it could be dangerous for some walkers. ""There are points where you're dicing with traffic and heavy vehicles and putting your life in your own hands. That won't happen if this project is funded,"" he said. He added the council was looking to start construction on phase 3 of the project within the next year. ""It probably has a 12-month construction period, so [it'll be] about two and a half years until the path is completed,"" he said.

20,Carriage trade: Decommissioned Gold Coast monorail on track to be holiday units,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Decommissioned Gold Coast monorail carriages on track to become holiday accommodation in NSW For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency After gathering dust in a storage yard for five years, the former Broadbeach monorail carriages may be on track for a new role as holiday accommodation after a private buyer has expressed interest in purchasing them. The once ""futuristic"" public transport system was decommissioned on the Gold Coast five years ago. Built in 1989, the monorail ferried passengers between the Oasis Shopping Centre and Jupiters Casino until it was mothballed in 2017. Trucking business owner Alberto Marques transported the carriages to his Arundel storage yard when the system shut. He said the original buyer intended to use the carriages in a new theme park that never eventuated. ""We ended up with them, and we thought we've got to do something with these carriages,"" he said. ""So we put them up [for sale] ... and maybe someone wants to do a cubby house."" Mr Marques said the carriages were in good condition and have remained untouched since they arrived in his yard. ""I have got two full sets which is one leading carriage at the front and back, because the monorail goes both ways, and then in the middle it's got three mid-carriages,"" he said. ""They've got the seats and the bars and the doors. ""Sometimes we go in there and have a coffee."" Mr Marques said he was negotiating with a surgeon who is interested in buying the carriages and trucking them to a property near New Italy in the New South Wales Northern Rivers region. ""He's really interested in the full set,"" he said. ""He's interested in taking them down to New South Wales … and he wants to set them up as a B&B [Bed and Breakfast]. ""So people actually push the button and go inside the room."" The business owner said he expected to sell the leading carriages for between $3,000 and $4,000, while he hoped to sell the mid-carriages for between $2,000 and $3,000.

21,What passengers can expect on Qantas' longest commercial flight in the world,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  What passengers can expect on Qantas' longest commercial flight in the world For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency They are the futuristic jets that will soon fly us halfway around the world without a stopover. That's if you can spend almost 20 hours confined to the cabin. Qantas announced the purchase of 12 Airbus A350-1000s for their long-haul Project Sunrise flights from Sydney to London and New York beginning in 2025. They will become the longest flights in the world, eclipsing the Singapore to New York haul of just over 17 hours. Qantas boss Alan Joyce championed the purchase, delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as the ""last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance"". So, what can the 238 passengers expect to see and how would a 20-hour flight work? Despite the fanfare, A350s have actually been flying in Australian skies for a few years. Cathay Pacific uses the aircraft on its Melbourne to Hong Kong route and Qatar Airways, which has the largest fleet of A350s with 19, flies it from Sydney to Doha. Internationally, A350s are being used on routes including Shanghai to Boston, Paris to Santiago and Manchester to Los Angeles. The plane is 73 metres long and most airlines use a 3-3-3 seating configuration in economy. The jet is competing with the Boeing 787 and 777X for market share. Qantas has partnered with the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney to investigate the impacts of ultra-long-haul flying on the human body. Professor Steve Simpson was part of a research team that hooked passengers up with wearable health monitors in the week before and after a long-haul flight in a series of tests in 2019. ""You're not sleeping well, you're fatigued, you're at low pressure, all the sorts of physical things that happen from being in the air,"" Professor Simpson said of the findings. Blood clotting in the legs, a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is a risk during long-haul flights. But Professor Simpson said non-stop flights from Australia to London or New York were no more risky than current long-haul routes. ""There's no evidence that being in the air for 15 hours is any worse than being in the air for 19 hours,"" he said. Qantas' A350 will feature a ""wellbeing zone"" where passengers from all classes can stretch their legs. Professor Simpson said getting some physical activity, even if it was a five-minute stretch, was critical to minimising the health impacts of flying. He added that cabin light, meal service, types of meals and stretching could all help passengers feel more refreshed at their destination. The plan has the backing of Tony Lucas, the president of the Australian and International Pilots Association. ""The fatigue of those sorts of 20-hour flights is certainly something that we're going to need to manage,"" he said. ""We'll work closely with Qantas and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to make sure that we've got a good regime in place, I'm sure the Australian and travelling public expects their crews to be well rested."" Mr Lucas suggested changing the crewing arrangements could be one way of managing the issue of fatigue. ""Traditionally on long-haul flights we would operate the aircraft with one captain, one first officer and two second officers,"" he said. ""What we might find on these Sunrise flights, is that we operate with a slightly heavier crew, that is with one captain, perhaps two first officers and one second officer."" Shane O'Neil flew 18 hours from Darwin-London to see family in February. ""I felt better than if we had gone through Dubai, the total duration was less and we didn't have the anxiety of changing planes,"" he said. Travellers at Sydney Airport gearing up for intercontinental flights on Monday were more hesitant. Sophie Ball and Max Barker were jetting off to Vancouver for a working holiday. ""This is our longest one for both of us, 14 hours, so another six on top of that wouldn't be great,"" Mr Barker said. Maile Loloa said a 20-hour flight sounded ""a little bit crazy"". ""I can't even last on a four-hour plane, so I don't know how its going to be on a 20-hour plane,"" she said.

23,Direct flights from Sydney to London and NYC are starting — this is how long passengers will need to spend on board,travel-and-tourism-lifestyle-and-leisure,"  Qantas announces plans for world's longest passenger flights, direct from Sydney to London and New York For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Qantas has announced it will begin direct flights from Sydney to London and New York from 2025. The new routes will be the longest passenger flights in the world, and are expected to take more than 19 hours. A Qantas test flight direct from New York to Sydney in 2019 took 19 hours and 16 minutes. The airline has bought 12 Airbus A350-1000s to operate the routes, and says the planes ""will have the range for direct flights between Australia and any city in the world"". Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline was looking for ways to make the lengthy new routes pleasant for passengers, including a ""wellbeing zone"" in the centre of the planes. ""The cabin is being specifically designed for maximum comfort in all classes for long-haul flying,"" he said. The A350-1000 planes will seat 238 passengers, 140 of those seats will be in economy class. NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said the announcement was ""a huge win for the state"". The airline has operated direct flights between Perth and London since 2018, however these were suspended during the pandemic due to Western Australia's tough COVID-19 border restrictions. It is now flying between London and Darwin instead. The airline, with Mr Joyce as a passenger, undertook the 2019 test flight to gauge the effects of long-haul travel on passengers. Fifty passengers and crew were fitted with technology devices to test their wellbeing during the flight and were given space for exercise. President of the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA), Tony Lucas, said the announcement represented a ""huge moment of renewal for the aviation industry"". Mr Lucas said the long-haul flights would present a challenge both operationally and in terms of fatigue, and those issues would need to be worked through with Qantas. ""We'll submit reports and monitor flight and study times, monitor how we are feeling both in flight and after arrival in London or Sydney ... and we'll learn from those experiences,"" he said. ""Given that no-one's ever operated these sort of flights before, that will be a learning experience for both Qantas and us as pilots, and we expect that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority will be involved in that process as well."" Mr Joyce said the airline had initially hoped to order the new planes in 2020, but that the pandemic had delayed the purchase. He also announced the airline's domestic fleet would be revamped with 40 new Airbus A321s and A220s . Those planes will touch down in Australia from late 2023.
