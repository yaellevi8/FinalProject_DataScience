0,It's a key promise to limit enormous emissions from fracking. But a government email has fuelled concerns it might not happen,environment,"  NT government bureaucrat warns fully implementing fracking recommendation 9.8 could scare off gas industry in confidential email For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A senior Northern Territory environmental bureaucrat warned that fully implementing a key commitment to limit fracking emissions could scare off the gas industry, confidential government correspondence reveals. The document, obtained by the ABC under Freedom of Information, also warns there might not be enough carbon credits in Australia to offset all emissions from fracking in the Beetaloo Basin. The basin, about 500 kilometres south-east of Darwin, is a large shale gas field that has formed a critical part of the federal government's post-COVID ""gas-led recovery"". When the NT government lifted a ban on fracking in 2018, it agreed to ""seek to ensure"" there would be no net increase in Australia's life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from producing gas, a recommendation known as ""9.8"" in a landmark fracking inquiry. However, in an email from within the NT Department of Environment from March last year to Chief Executive Joanne Townsend, public servant Paul Purdon asks ""how ambitious"" the government wants to be, saying the ""preferred approach"" was to focus on emissions within the NT's control, as well as the net-zero by 2050 target. ""Full implementation of recommendation 9.8 would place the NT at a competitive disadvantage in attracting gas production and related downstream development,"" Mr Purdon writes. In response to questions about the email, an NT government spokeswoman said all public policy advice ""should include analysis of how it applies, intersects or conflicts with other policies and policy commitments"". Environmentalists claim the correspondence raises serious questions. ""It's not appropriate for the environmental regulator to be factoring in questions of whether or not the gas industry is going to appreciate having to offset their emissions,"" Hannah Ekin from the Arid Lands Environment Centre said. ""We see this again and again — [the government] are bending over backwards to facilitate this gas industry, regardless of what the impacts are on our community. The correspondence has escalated long-standing concerns that Recommendation 9.8 to offset emissions could be weakened. The fracking inquiry's recommendation specifically related to limiting life cycle greenhouse gas emissions – that is, all emissions created from the production of gas in the NT as well as its transportation and consumption elsewhere. Politicians, environmentalists, traditional owners and gas company representatives have arrived in Darwin for a public hearing into the Beetaloo Basin. Many of those emissions will occur outside of the Northern Territory, so the inquiry made the Recommendation a responsibility for the Commonwealth government too. The NT government has previously said gas companies will play a significant role too, and it has recently progressed policies that would require companies to use mechanisms like carbon credits to offset their emissions. However, in the email, Mr Purdon wrote that a key question for the government was ""how ambitious [it] wants to be in implementing recommendation 9.8 in the NT itself"". He wrote that one option would be ""to require the offsetting of all production emissions (petroleum companies only)"" and another would be to ""require the offsetting of all production, transportation and consumption emissions in the NT"". He also wrote that it was ""questionable"" whether the national supply of recognised carbon credits would be enough to offset life cycle emissions from NT gas. Mark Ogge, a climate and energy advisor with the Australia Institute and observer in this space, said it was ""absolutely damning that there's not enough offsets in all of Australia to offset the potential emissions from fracking in the Northern Territory."" ""If that's the case and there's not enough offsets, it simply means — if the emissions can't be offset — then fracking shouldn't be able to go ahead,"" he said. Other challenges Mr Purdon listed in the email include: ""The preferred approach to delivering recommendation 9.8 is to focus on the emissions that are in the Territory's control, in the context of the net zero by 2050 target and the pathway required to achieve the target,"" the email said. There is also confusion over the extent of the Morrison government's support for the recommendation. The federal government holds that the fracking inquiry's report was not a report for the Commonwealth, but said it would work with the NT government to honour its commitment. NT Renewables and Energy Minister Eva Lawler has denied the federal government has distanced itself, pointing to a bilateral energy and emissions deal signed last month. ""Recommendation 9.8 means that we all have to work together to achieve that recommendation,"" she said. She said her government had taken many steps to achieve the recommendation, including progressing emissions offsets policies which require companies to address climate change. Ms Ekin from the Arid Lands Environment Centre said she was concerned the government's focus was shifting to its broader target of net zero emissions by 2050. But she said failing to honour the commitment before production begins could call ""into question the viability of living in the Top End of Australia into the future"". ""We think everything needs to be done to prevent out-of-control climate change — the stakes are that high,"" she said.

1,"Wombat Forest clean-up makes more mess, activists say",environment,"  Wombat Forest salvage logging continues after Game Management Authority removes protesters For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The removal of logs felled by last year's ferocious storm through Victoria's central highlands has resumed in the Wombat Forest after protesters were removed from the worksite. Storms in June 2021 felled countless trees in parts of the Wombat Forest Vic Forest has employed contractors to clear fallen logs near Babbington Hill in the Wombat Forest Wombat Forestcare says removing the logs is unnecessary and is causing more damage to the environment Logging contractors were not impeded by local environmentalists from the Wombat Forestcare group on Wednesday, although several of the protestors continued to monitor the clearing work from a nearby road. The contractors and the protesters have accused each other of threatening behaviour during the dispute. Contractor Jim Greenwood said his team of four workers was employed by Vic Forest to remove the logs through 120ha of the forest at Babbington Hill. He said it came at the request of the commercial arm of the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation. He said activists from Wombat Forest Care had not interrupted their work since Game Management Authority staff had intervened. ""It's the first time (the work has not been interrupted) for days,"" Mr Greenwood said. ""Overall, it's not real good: the interaction between the workers and protesters."" Wombat Forestcare spokesperson Gayle Osborne said her group was protesting the damage that was being caused by the group. ""This is meant to be a national park, and promised to be a national park, and now we are seeing this massive destruction of the area,"" she said. She said contractors had cleared nearly a hectare of standing trees to create a ""massive"" log landing that could fit two B-double trucks and machinery. ""They have compacted the soil and created large tracks through the forest,"" Ms Osborne said. Ms Osborne conceded the logs could not be removed without causing damage, however she said removing the logs was unnecessary because they did not present a fire risk. She said the logs needed to stay on the ground to provide future natural habitat. ""Some of the tracks are close to trees that survived the storm, which are home to threatened greater gliders, and have now been weakened to the extent they may fall anyway,"" Ms Osborne said. ""There's also a wedge-tailed eagle nest on the hill and the machinery has been working illegally too close to that."" Mr Greenwood said there had been additional damage to parts of the forest as the contractors removed the fallen logs. ""We can only do what we can but it's impossible to do no damage,"" he said. ""But we certainly aren't going out of our way to do more (damage) and we are not taking anything out that was not already damaged."" He said survey work had been done to protect threatened species. ""We have a tablet which tells us the areas we are not allowed in, and it's not just about the animals,"" he said. ""There are areas we are not allowed in because of a type of daisy."" Mr Greenwood said protesters were risking their lives by entering the work area. ""Three walked in other day just before dark,"" he said. ""They were all in grey and black clothing and you couldn barely see them."" He said he told the protesters whould have a vest on so workers could see them and they had taken that on board. ""It's about making sure no one gets hurt,"" he said. ""If I am lifting and moving a log that weighs 10 to 12 tonnes, I cannot just stop. ""They don't realise the danger they are in. It's crazy.""

2,"Western Australia gets its first real rain of the season, but it's too late for many sun-scorched plant",environment,"  Half of Western Australia forecast to get rain over the next two days in first decent falls of the season For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Parts of Western Australia are being warned to brace for heavy rain and damaging winds from this evening, as two systems combine to bring a blast of wintry weather to half of the state. Already on Thursday, rain totals of up to 60 millimetres have been recorded through west-coastal and south-western parts of the state. A road weather warning is in place for people in Perth. A severe weather warning has been issued for people in parts of the Central West, Gascoyne, and Pilbara for damaging winds up to 90 kilometres an hour and heavy rainfall, likely to develop from early afternoon near the coast. Six hourly totals between 60 and 90 mm are possible, and isolated falls of 100 to 150mm are possible in the north-west, including Exmouth and Onslow, according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). A separate warning has been issued for people on the south coast, from Augusta to Hopetoun, for damaging winds up to 90 kilometres an hour. Western Australia is being hit by its first significant rain of the season, bringing crucial falls to crops and sun-scorched forests in the south-west of the state. About half of the state is forecast to receive rain over the next two days, with showers extending from the West Pilbara to Eucla. BOM duty forecaster Jessica Lingard said today would be the main event. The south-west land division, including Perth, is expected to receive the highest rainfall totals between 20 and 50 millimetres from yesterday to Friday. Agricultural areas may receive between 10 and 30 millimetres and isolated falls of up to 80 millimetres are possible near coastal parts of the state. Most of the rain will fall on Thursday, with showers easing in the South West on Friday, but continuing in northern and eastern regions until Saturday. A dangerous swell of between five and eight metres is also expected to kick between Shark Bay and Israelite Bay from Thursday night and into Friday. Tides may also be higher than normal. Ms Lingard said the rain was being driven by a combination of a cold front and a moisture-laden cloud band extending from an ex-tropical cyclone. ""We had those three cold fronts that moved through in quick succession a couple of weeks ago, but they didn't bring much rainfall and they didn't push very far inland,"" she said. ""So this is sort of the first significant system that's moving decently over the agricultural areas."" After a scorching hot summer, which broke several heat records, including the hottest summer on record for Perth, it will be a much-needed break for the region. Murdoch University lecturer in environmental and conservation sciences Joe Fontaine said while some deeper-rooted plants had been shielded by a soaking wet winter in 2021, the intense heat had taken its toll. ""What we've been seeing in parts of the northern jarrah forest is that sites with a little less water for plants have begun to die,"" he said. ""Shrubs, which are the most shallow rooted plants, have begun to die, and in other places trees on a shallower rooted soil have begun to die back."" He said some plants would not recover, but there was still hope for others and the coming rain would be vital. ""So you can imagine, it's like running a marathon every summer for these plants,"" he said. ""The deeper you go into autumn without significant rainfall, the greater the likelihood that those plants don't make it over the finish line. ""So a good season break like this, that will dump 15 to 30mm of rain, is quite important."" Farmers in the Great Southern who have planted their grain crop for the year also have their hopes pinned on the rainfall. So far autumn rainfall has been mixed across the state. While the south coast, parts of the central west and Gascoyne are slightly above average, Perth, the Great Southern and the South West have had average to below-average rainfall. Tarin Rock grain farmer Ed Naisbitt told the WA Country Hour they had not had decent rainfall in over a month. ""The leaves are wilted and are hanging limp, and it's quite obvious that there's moisture stress, so under those situations they're not going to be growing vigorously. ""Looking at them probably just makes the person stressed. ""So you just cross you fingers and hope the rain will come."" He said they were hoping for another 25mm of rain. Agricultural areas are forecast to get between 10 and 30mm, according to the bureau. Current climate outlooks suggest it is going to be a wet winter for most of Australia, except for the south-west corner of WA, which has an equal chance of receiving an above or below-average rainfall. There are also early indications a negative Indian Ocean Dipole phase may develop in the coming months, however, the bureau notes the accuracy of outlooks at this time of year are low and should be viewed with caution. A negative Indian Ocean Dipole typically increases the chances of above-average winter and spring rainfall for much of Australia. Its influence is generally minimal for south-west WA, but it did play a role in Perth's wettest July in decades in 2021.

3,How do the climate policies of the three major parties stack up? We asked some experts to rank them,environment," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency You'd think the government and opposition would be keen to focus on the number-one issue for voters this election campaign. Yet if 2019 was the climate change election, 2022 is shaping up to be the don't-talk-about-climate-change election. Despite climate change topping voters' (29 per cent) list of concerns, both the Labor Party and LNP have been avoiding it like the plague. While that might suit them — given the perceived divisiveness of the issue among some of their prospective supporter bases — it leaves many climate-concerned voters with very little to go on. So, we've asked some Australian climate scientists, all of them IPCC-contributing authors, to take a look at the climate policies of the Coalition, Labor and the Greens, and give you a breakdown of how each major party's climate policies stack up. Responses have been trimmed for brevity, and omitted where they have doubled up. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese gear up for the third and final leaders' debate. The Liberal Party policy includes net-zero by 2050 and a 2030 emissions reduction target of 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels, though they say we're on track for higher than that. Their Long-term Emissions Reduction Plan includes such focuses as clean energy technology, carbon capture and storage, and investment in emerging technologies like low-emissions cement and agriculture. It's a ""clear plan"" for achieving net-zero by 2050, according to a statement on Scott Morrison's website, that will ""deliver results through technology not taxes"". The Labor Party policy includes a net-zero target by 2050 and a 2030 emissions reduction target of 43 per cent on 2005 levels. Their Powering Australia plan includes a national electric vehicle strategy, electricity grid upgrades, and investment in green manufacturing. Their plan will ""prioritise growth and investment for the regions"" according to the ALP website, while delivering Australian business ""certainty"". The Greens policy is to reach net-zero by 2035. Their focus includes clean energy generation and a transition away from coal and gas by 2030. Their Powering Past Coal and Gas plan outlines EV and green industry strategies, and includes ending fossil fuel subsidies and closing tax loopholes. Their plan will ""create hundreds of thousands of jobs, bring electricity costs down, and drive our economy into the future"", according to their website. The ABC put a set of four questions to each of the scientists. They were first sent on April 27, so some answers may pertain to policies current as of that date, regardless of subsequent updates. Peter Newman — no ""This policy is not seriously ensuring the transition begins immediately and leads to interim targets that are achievable, and hence could lead to net-zero by 2050. [That is what is needed to] keep us within reach of the 1.5C target. The work on hydrogen hubs may be the best thing the Liberals have done, but does not appear in the policy, so it doesn't seem a serious exercise. The assessment here is based on what is provided as the Liberal Policy for Environment. However, it does not set out many of the activities already underway and/or committed and in budgets. This means it seems to be lacking substance … [and] the public have only this very simplistic list of ideas."" Lesley Hughes — far from it ""If every country was to follow Australia's lead on climate, the world would be headed for warming in excess of 3C and even up to 4C. At 3C or 4C … Black Summer will be considered a cool year. Really, if we are to have any chance of limiting warming to 1.5C, Australia needs to be aiming high, and setting a target to cut emissions by 74 per cent by 2030 and getting to net-zero emissions by 2035. This is the target recommended last year by an independent Climate Targets Panel…"" Nerilie Abram — wildly inconsistent ""To limit warming to 1.5 degrees requires Australia's emissions to be cut by 74 per cent by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2035. The current Liberal Party policy would have used up our entire remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5 degrees before we even get to 2030."" Peter Newman — the best thing yet ""This policy is the best thing yet we have seen in Australian politics to get us to being a good global citizen that abides by its Paris commitments. An ALP government could take these commitments to the next UNFCCC [United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] conference in Egypt in December and show they have ratcheted up their level of commitment with a clear set of strategies behind them."" Nerilie Abram — no ""It increases the ambition of Australia's 2030 emission reduction target to 43 per cent, which is a substantial improvement on the Liberal Party target, but isn't the 50-74 per cent reduction that Australia needs to make by 2030 to play our part in meeting the Paris Agreement."" Andy Pitman — 1.5C virtually impossible Professor Pitman gave the same response to this question for all parties. He said that he believes limiting warming to 1.5C is now ""virtually impossible"". ""Any party that commits to limiting warming to 1.5C needs to explain how [they will do it]. It would require overshoot and active removal of carbon from the atmosphere which is subject to multiple technical and feasibility constraints."" Peter Newman — yes, but ... ""Yes in theory, but not in practice. Paris requires commitments to go beyond targets by having detailed strategies of how to achieve them. These strategies are good ideas, but [need to be] linked into detailed modeling that relates to delivery."" Lesley Hughes — yes ""Yes, this policy does meet that goal. It is the only policy from a major party that matches the scale and pace of action the climate science demands. Any shot at limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius requires drawing down significant amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The Greens' plan recognises this, and proposes achieving 100 million tonnes of 'negative emissions' by 2040, although it does not elaborate on how this will be achieved."" Nerilie Abram — yes ""The policy of the Greens is consistent with the scientific evidence for the scale and speed of emission reductions needed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees."" Lesley Hughes — no confidence ""To be frank, we have no confidence whatsoever in the LNP's Net Zero by 2050 plan. It may as well have been written in crayon. Remarkably, the Liberal-National Government's own modeling for this does not get Australia to net-zero by 2050. It is, in fact, only a little more than half by 2050."" Nerilie Abram — no confidence ""Their plan for net-zero relies on untenable assumptions of greenhouse gas removal and doesn't actually even get to zero by 2050."" Andy Pitman — not enough information to assess ""That is very hard to assess because there are no intermediate targets. Given it is not ""the Liberal Party"" that is central here, rather it is the Coalition, and given statements from some in the Coalition, I would prefer to see a legislated 2035 target from which to build."" Peter Newman — confident ""The modeling by Reputex [energy research company] in the ALP policy seems very credible and traces each policy into a quantitative delivery of 43 per cent greenhouse gas reduction by 2030, based on conservative and well-researched assumptions. These early interventions are the most important part of the transition to 2050, as once they are underway they take off."" Lesley Hughes — confident ""First of all, the modeling Labor has used is robust and it checks out. So I can say with confidence that the 2030 target in the ALP plan has set Australia on a path to achieve net-zero in 2050."" Andy Pitman — low confidence ""I think net-zero is hugely challenging to achieve and some of the strategies are less likely to deliver emission reductions than I think the ALP hope. However, they have set a target for 2030 which I think is important as it … allows an evaluation of how they are tracking."" NB. The Greens consider net-zero by 2050 a ""death sentence"" and aim to reach net-zero by 2035 or sooner. Some of the responses below relate to the Greens' aim of net-zero by 2035. Peter Newman — low confidence in net-zero by 2035 ""[I'm] not sure they can get to 100 per cent by 2035. This is a serious plan which is quantified and costed with jobs and greenhouse gas savings clearly assigned in each state. The need to make such policies become real and deliverable begins with good modeling and then has to bring all the states. This is hard to see in the document."" Nerilie Abram — low confidence in net-zero by 2035 ""I don't doubt the ambition of the Greens, and their aim for net-zero by 2035 is science based. But net-zero is a hugely challenging target that we don't yet have the technical capability to achieve, and this plan doesn't lay out the detail for how Australia will reach [it]."" Andy Pitman — moderately confident in net-zero by 2050 ""The Greens' climate policies are consistent with what scientists have been saying for a long time. If implemented, I think this would get Australia close to net-zero by 2050."" Peter Newman — not serious ""Not serious and lacking detail even on their best projects being announced. Obviously, they are divided and unable to make a serious contribution."" Lesley Hughes — not an effective climate policy ""The Morrison government's climate policy can be summarised pretty quickly and simply really, in that the Morrison government has no effective federal climate policy. [They] are actively supporting the expansion of fossil fuel production while at the same time banking on … technology that may or may not materialise sometime in the next three decades to solve the greatest threat of our time: climate change. That's a hell of a gamble."" Nerilie Abram — lacks ambition ""It has lots of catchphrases designed to make it seem like they are doing enough, but it lacks any real ambition and is not based on the scientific evidence."" Andy Pitman — difficult to assess without targets ""A 2035 target should be part of the equation in my view, and without that target, the viability of the Liberal strategies is difficult to assess."" Peter Newman — a solid start ""A very solid start with the potential to make a real difference. There is confidence in this climate policy as it's been taken seriously with a very good quantitative basis to the next steps, which can put us clearly into being Paris-compliant. There could be much more of a target, but it's still up there with most progressive nations."" Lesley Hughes — a good start ""It's a good start, but it could certainly be more ambitious. Under the ALP plan, renewable energy (like solar and wind) is expected to power 82 per cent of our electricity needs by 2030. So there's a focus on transitioning the grid to renewables. Notably, the modeling will lead to significant jobs growth and private investment."" Nerilie Abram — promising elements ""This policy has some very promising elements, including a strong focus on emission reductions this decade … that is certainly what is needed if we are going to tackle the climate change problem."" Andy Pitman — not particularly ambitious but … ""It balances what is electorally palatable with meeting the 2C limit under Paris. It is not particularly ambitious but, given where we are, it is probably about as ambitious as can be achieved without a very great deal of courage."" Peter Newman — strong, though lacking sophistication ""This has a series of policies for adaptation and mitigation that are quantified, though not with the sophistication of the Reputex [ALP] modelling. It shows how they will reach 100 per cent by 2035 and then by 2050, it goes into negative emissions by regenerating the landscape with carbon farming. However, it is not modelled showing delivery. It is simply straight lines from now to a precipitous drop to 100 per cent in the next 12 years. They have some transport policies including public transport, but in the end, they are focused on decarbonising power. The repair of the landscape is a strong part of the policy, but lacks detail."" Lesley Hughes — a lot to like, with some gaps ""There is a lot to like about this policy. It's ambitious and it takes tangible and urgent steps to reduce emissions quickly and to rewire and electrify Australia. It would also see big polluters having to pay for the damage caused by their emissions contributions. However, it does have some gaps: it does not cover Australia's responsibility to support vulnerable communities abroad with adapting to the impacts of climate change. The plan could also be strengthened with clearer steps and targets for phasing out gas production and exports from Australia."" Nerilie Abram — science based, but lacks detail ""The aims of this policy are science based, but the plan lacks the level of detail and modeling of the major parties. The Greens, together with independent candidates, could have an important role to play in forcing the future government to raise ambitions, so that Australia's emission reductions efforts this decade happen with the speed and scale that is needed."" Andy Pitman — broadly consistent with science, but ... ""I think the Green's climate policies are broadly consistent with the science — the challenge is their implementation and that needs to be done urgently, and politically feasibly.""

4,Repeated mass emperor penguin chick deaths prompt dire climate change warning,environment,"  Emperor penguin at serious risk of extinction due to climate change For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The emperor penguin is at severe risk of extinction in the next 30 to 40 years as a result of climate change, according to research by the Argentine Antarctic Institute (IAA). The emperor, the world's largest penguin and one of only two penguin species endemic to Antarctica, gives birth during the Antarctic winter and requires solid sea ice from April through to December to nest fledgling chicks. If the sea freezes later or melts prematurely, the emperor family cannot complete its reproductive cycle. ""If the water reaches the newborn penguins, which are not ready to swim and do not have waterproof plumage, they die of the cold and drown,"" said biologist Marcela Libertelli, who has studied 15,000 penguins across two colonies in Antarctica at the IAA. This has happened at the Halley Bay colony in the Weddell Sea, the second-largest Emperor penguin colony, where for three years all the chicks died. Every August, in the middle of the southern hemisphere winter, Dr Libertelli and other scientists at Argentina's Marambio Base in Antarctica travel 65 km each day by motorbike in temperatures as low as -40 degrees Celsius to reach the nearest Emperor penguin colony. Once there, they count, weigh, and measure the chicks, gather geographical coordinates, and take blood samples. They also conduct aerial analysis. The scientists' findings point to a grim future for the species if climate change is not mitigated. ""[Climate] projections suggest that the colonies that are located between latitudes 60 and 70 degrees [south] will disappear in the next few decades; that is, in the next 30, 40 years,"" Dr Libertelli said. The emperor's unique features include the longest reproductive cycle among penguins. After a chick is born, one parent continues carrying it between its legs for warmth until it develops its final plumage. ""The disappearance of any species is a tragedy for the planet. Whether small or large, plant or animal — it doesn't matter. It's a loss for biodiversity,"" Dr Libertelli said. Global warming is already changing the world before our eyes — let's see what has happened in your lifetime. The emperor penguin's disappearance could have a dramatic impact throughout Antarctica, an extreme environment where food chains have fewer members and fewer links, Dr Libertelli said. In early April, the World Meteorological Organization warned of ""increasingly extreme temperatures coupled with unusual rainfall and ice melting in Antarctica"" — a ""worrying trend"", said Dr Libertelli, with Antarctic ice sheets depleting since at least 1999. The rise of tourism and fishing in Antarctica have also put the emperor's future at risk by affecting krill, one of the main sources of food for penguins and other species. ""Tourist boats often have various negative effects on Antarctica, as do the fisheries,"" Dr Libertelli said. ""It is important that there is greater control and that we think about the future.""

5,Proof's in the paddocks as young family breathes life into 'tired' property,environment,"  Permaculture principles help young SA family regenerate sustainable dream property For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Joel Catchlove and Sophie Green were focused on regeneration when they bought 19ha of hilltop grazing land on South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula in 2012. They had spent years looking for the right property to apply their permaculture knowledge before finding what would become Yarnauwi, a small, scenic farm near Second Valley, about 80km south of Adelaide. Mr Catchlove, who had completed a permaculture design certificate at South Australian permaculture farm The Food Forest, said they arrived with ""90 per cent ignorance and 10 per cent masochism"". ""We had always had this sense of wanting to develop a small scale, regenerative vision for how you might regenerate a patch of land, but also be somewhat self-reliant with the community around you in terms of food and fuel,"" he said. They had a mammoth task of applying permaculture principles to manage a plot of rural land that had been cultivated for cattle, sheep and hay for 170 years. Mr Catchlove said he learned the difference very quickly having come from an urban context where the scale was different and people were used to being able to control a lot of elements. ""Things look a bit dry? You water them,"" Mr Catchlove said. ""Whereas we came here and suddenly there's everything going on — sinkholes forming, there's gullies, huge amounts of kangaroos. ""So there were all these things that were suddenly beyond our control."" With their children, Annika and Asher, Mr Catchlove and and Ms Green focused on a couple of influential permaculture ideas as they began work. The ""big one"" was about observing and recording. Mr Catchlove said it was about spending time learning about the unique capacities and limitations of their patch of land. It involved a stream of constant questions about what was happening with the soil, fungi, plants, weather and animals. Another is the idea of ""zoning"" the property by fencing it into different areas depending on the amount of energy they would need, such as house versus habitat zones. They also asked Adelaide University's Indigenous language group Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi for a property name and were granted Yarnauwi — meaning ""bald hills"". It was also a nod to nearby gathering place Yarnauwingga — to acknowledge the Kaurna people's cultural connection to the area. ""Part of the observe and interact thing for us has been about understanding the history and getting a sense of First Nations uses, but also how it's evolved over time, what the impacts have been of colonisation, and therefore [asking], 'What do we need to do to kind of help the landscape function?',"" Joel said. The proof is in the paddocks — after a decade of Joel's and Sophie's efforts, Yarnauwi is visibly thriving. Almost 8,000 trees have been planted on the property with the help of friends, family and neighbours to draw back local fauna. ""Rebuilding habitat has always been a really big motivator for us,"" Mr Catchlove said. ""When you see this landscape, it's been cleared for a long, long time and we really wanted to see, particularly, woodland birds come back. ""In the last couple of years, we've started seeing a number of those woodlands starting to return, which is really pleasing."" The Food Forest co-founder Graham Brookman said the permaculture movement hade gained traction internationally over the past 35 years. ""I think that the concept of sustainable living has exploded and permaculture is just one part of that,"" he said. ""Permaculture gives you the whole picture and I think that's why it's such a brilliant kind of philosophy — it's not aligned with any religious things, so it can be taught and accepted worldwide, and it doesn't have any particular political affiliation. ""All it's asking people to do is really respect the planet, and here are some really great tools for doing it, whether you live in a city, in the country or wherever."" Mr Brookman said permaculture would only continue to grow as climate change affected farming practices, fertiliser prices rose and the world faced a potential food crisis. ""The nurseries have not been able to keep up with the demand for seedlings and seeds,"" Mr Brookman said. ""If you look at our local Mitre 10, it's got more organic fertilisers there than you can shake a stick at. ""So this stuff is happening. Whether people use the word permaculture or not is sort of beside the point, as long as one way or another they get that idea of holistic decision making through their heads.""

6,Rare May fires driven by 'violent winds' in Siberia kill at least 10,environment,"  Rare May fires break out in Siberia, killing at least 10 For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Fires that have broken out across south-western Siberia have killed at least 10 people and damaged hundreds of buildings, according to local authorities. Hundreds of firefighters are trying to contain the blazes, which are a rare occurrence in the region during May and have been fuelled by a lack of rain and fierce winds, they said. In the Krasnoyarsk region, at least five people lost their lives in the fires, which damaged about 450 homes, the local authorities said, declaring a state of emergency. In the Kemerovo region, three people were found dead in a burnt home. In the Omsk region, two people died. ""Extinguishing [the fires] is being complicated by meteorological conditions. Violent winds are fanning the flames and preventing them from being put out,"" the regional ministry for emergencies in Krasnoyarsk said on Telegram. Regional governor Alexander Uss said gales of up to 40 metres per second had brought down trees and power lines across large swathes of the Krasnoyarsk region, sparking the fires. Authorities said 300 firemen backed by 90 vehicles were fighting the flames. ""We have called for help from neighbouring territories but are aware that will in the best case not arrive for some hours,"" said Mr Uss, adding temporary shelters were being opened for people in the worst-hit areas. ""I have given the order to cut off electricity in part of the region — save for survival facilities, service stations and water supply systems,"" he said. Roman Vilfand, of Russia's Hydrometeorological Research Centre, told the TASS news agency that such fires were rare in May. ""But there hasn't been rain for a long time, there were fires, and then strong wind,"" he said. Forest-rich Siberia has suffered from unprecedented fires for several years. Last year, they belched 16 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, according to an annual European climate report.

9,'Just hanging on': Can feral-free zones across NSW bring native mammals back from brink of extinction?,environment,"  Feral-free zones plan in South East NSW to bring native mammals back from the brink of extinction For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency It may not be a well-known fact, but feral animals remain one of the biggest threats to Australia's native wildlife. Now it is hoped the construction of ""feral-free zones"" across NSW national parks will help bring dozens of species back from the brink of extinction. The state government is proposing to create 65,000 hectares of feral-free national parks, with the first coastal zone being proposed in the South East of NSW, near Bombala. Head of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Atticus Fleming, said the plan would help address one of Australia's biggest conservation problems. ""Australia has the worst mammal extinction rate in the world, and we've got a lot of species that are just hanging on,"" he said. ""One of the biggest factors in that extinction rate has been the impact of feral cats and foxes and other feral animals."" The New South Wales government has proposed feral-proof fences around 2,000 hectares of the South East Forest National Park, Nungatta. Native mammals including the long-footed potoroo, eastern bettong, smoky mouse and eastern quoll are among the species the project could reintroduce into the area. The $2.5–$3 million zone is one of seven predator-free areas set up by the state government and the first to be established on the east coast. Mr Fleming said it was hoped it would help ""turn back time"" for the bushland. ""People will be able to come and see the Australian bush as it was a couple of hundred years ago before feral animals arrived,"" he said. Sections of the South East Forest National Park were severely burnt during the 2019–2020 bushfires. David Lindenmayer from ANU's School of Environment and Society said the reintroduction of native species would help the bush recover. ""These animals actually play a really important role in engineering the ecosystem,"" Professor Lindenmayer said. ""These animals do a lot of digging and burrowing, which actually helps lead to much better infiltration of rain, much stronger patterns of plant growth and much higher levels of plant cover."" While conservationists like professor Lindenmayer welcome the creation of these ""mainland islands,"" he said more work needed to be done. ""It really makes no sense to do these kinds of things unless we tackle the other drivers of animal decline,"" Professor Lindenmayer said. ""Problems like extensive logging, too much fire and land clearing need to be tackled as well."" Another issue he raised was the ""lack"" of funding for conservation by the state and federal governments. ""Our investment is about one-tenth of what it needs to be — so we need to get that sorted out,"" he said. ""We know that actually saving Australia's endangered species would be the equivalent of a screen door in a submarine."" However, NSW Environment Minister James Griffin said the government was spending more on conservation than it ever had. ""We've never spent more money than we're spending right now,"" he said. ""More than $80 million is going into wildlife restoration."" The public is encouraged to have their say on the plan of management regarding the South East feral-free zone before construction begins in the middle of the year. It's hoped the first native species can be reintroduced by the end of 2023.

10,How much are you willing to pay to help reduce carbon emissions? Vote Compass has the answer,environment,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency It is the question that has driven a protracted debate, which has gripped Australian politics for the better part of a decade. How much should Australia do to reduce its carbon emissions? At a time when climate change poses one of the biggest challenges for the nation and the globe, Vote Compass data shows an overwhelming number of Australians want more action. Almost 60 per cent of voters want ""much more"" cuts to emissions, and another 20 per cent said Australia could be doing ""somewhat"" more. In all, 79 per cent support further action. Just 7 per cent of voters thought Australia should be cutting fewer emissions, another 13 per cent thought we could be doing about the same as now. In Perth, Catherine Patterson and her family of four are doing everything they can to reduce their carbon footprint. Ms Patterson, who works for an environmental charity, said she and her husband are mindful of travelling too much and ""only do trips away when necessary"". Most of their furniture is second-hand and the family strives to reduce waste around the house by composting and thinking about each new item they buy. Ms Patterson is pleased that many other Australian families are also supportive of a move to cut our emissions further. ""It's really great to see that sentiment, because I feel that personally, but I am also quite surprised because a lot of people have jobs that rely on oil and gas, it's great to hear that [most Australians] feel that way."" Given the evidence is ""real, and that its impacts appear to be significant"", many voters believe climate change has personal implications, according to Dr Peter Chen at The University of Sydney. Tasmania has gone from being an emitter of carbon dioxide to now removing more than it is emitting to the atmosphere — with researchers saying the turning point was when the logging of native forests stopped. ""Since the last election, we've had major fires and major flooding."" Dr Chen, who lectures on public policy, said after the election later this month, political scientists will be asking one key question: ""Are we going to see a big impact of the salience issue of climate in this election? ""Because there was a lot of discussion about the climate at the last election which didn't really eventuate. ""People saw it as an important issue, but not one they would change their vote over."" A majority of voters who intend to support Labor, the Greens and the Liberal-National parties supported a greater cut in emissions. But there was a clear difference along party lines among those who thought Australia could commit to ""much more"" action. At 94 per cent, an overwhelming number of Greens voters are looking for much more action, 81 per cent of Labor voters agreed, compared with 23 per cent of Liberal-National voters. ""I don't think the split is surprising, I guess it shows that issue has become extremely partisan and a marker of party differences,"" Dr Chen said. There was still majority support among Coalition voters for Australia to reduce its emissions — 58 per cent thought the government could do more, while a third of Liberal-National voters were comfortable with what the nation was already doing. The Coalition and Labor have both committed to a net zero by 2050 target. But Labor has committed to cutting emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. The Coalition has stuck with its target of making cuts of between 26 and 28 per cent by 2030. Its plan includes utilising carbon capture, low emission steel production and hydrogen. Labor is investing in upgrading the transmission network and supporting community batteries and electric vehicles. Catherine Patterson's family factors in environmentally friendly investments into their budget. Investing in solar panels, an electric vehicle and charging station has enabled them to reduce their bills ""quite substantially"", Ms Patterson said. ""Before we bought them, it was an investment… but it's been quite incremental, we haven't tried to do everything at once, we've done one thing at a time and we've saved up for it."" Vote Compass asked how much voters would be prepared to spend each year to help prevent climate change. A quarter of Greens voters said they'd be willing to pay more than $2,000 annually to mitigate climate change. While a quarter of Coalition voters said they wanted to pay nothing. Paying between $100 and $500 per year felt about right for voters of all major parties — a quarter of Labor, Liberal-National and Greens voters selected this answer. And on the question of whether we should stop exporting coal to other countries to be used for electricity, Australians had a mixed response, with 23 per cent saying they strongly agreed. Another 24 per cent of Australians ""somewhat"" agreed. A relatively high proportion of voters were neutral on the question at 17 per cent, and 34 per cent disagreed either strongly or somewhat with stopping coal exports for energy. More Australian women agreed with halting coal exports — 55 per cent were in favour, compared with 37 per cent of men. Coalition voters were not in favour of stopping coal exports — 63 per cent disagreed with that idea, either strongly or somewhat.

11,Major mine sat on government panel that chose its own independent monitor,environment,"  McArthur River Mine representatives sat on government tender panel that chose new independent monitor For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A massive lead and zinc mine at the centre of numerous environmental scandals had a hand in the appointment of its own independent regulator, according to confidential documents obtained by environmentalists. The mine's new independent monitor was selected by a tender assessment panel late in 2019 FOI documents show two representatives from the mine sat on that panel The independent monitor's latest report found the mine was highly compliant with its environmental requirements The revelation is contained in tender documents released to the Environment Centre NT (ECNT) under Freedom of Information laws. They relate to the appointment of the McArthur River Mine's new independent monitor — an environmental oversight body that assesses the mine and the government department regulating it, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade (DITT). The documents show two representatives from the major mine, about 1,000 kilometres south-east of Darwin, sat alongside government bureaucrats on the seven-person tender assessment panel that selected the mine's new independent monitor in late 2019. Consulting firm Advisian scored highly on the procurement criteria and was subsequently awarded the work. However, it was later revealed that the government had changed the scope of the monitoring from an environmental assessment to a compliance audit and accepted a tender that was much cheaper than estimated. A group of NT public servants who alleged management fraud and misconduct has affected their ability to regulate major mines are dismayed the ICAC has rejected their complaint. The environment centre's Kirsty Howey said the mine's involvement in the tender process raised questions about the integrity of Advisian's glowing latest report card. ""The crux of the independent monitor report is that the monitor needs to be independent of government, and free of influence from government and the mining company,"" she said. ""It makes clear that [mine owner] Glencore has influenced that process. ""We think that is extremely concerning and completely at odds with the promise that's been made to Territorians about independent oversight of this mine"". The independent monitor's report is one of the key ways any significant environmental risks are monitored and disclosed to the public, including the waste rock dump that sparked health concerns when it spontaneously combusted in 2013. The government (DITT) said it did not believe the mine's involvement in the tender selection posed a conflict of interest. ""The tender assessment panel was led by the NT Government, and consisted of representatives from multiple NT Government departments and MRM,"" she said. ""An independent probity advisor was engaged to oversee the assessment process."" Asked if it requested to be on the committee, a spokeswoman from the mining company said: ""The Northern Territory Government has always been responsible for coordinating the tender and appointment of the Independent Monitor"". Advisian's latest report, covering the year to April 2021, was released yesterday and found both the mine and the department were highly compliant with their regulatory requirements. It concluded there were no environmental issues requiring urgent investigation and the McArthur River and its tributaries — a key concern for nearby communities — were in good health. However, Ms Howey claimed the report had become ""light on detail"" under the changed scope, and appeared not to include important information like a register of potential significant risks. ""Effectively, what this document has been reduced to is a tick-and-flick exercise which ticks off whether certain regulatory requirements have been met, rather than undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment of what this mine poses,"" she said. ""There has not been any assessment of risk able to be undertaken by the independent monitor, which means that really the report is worthless."" The report itself said the risk register had not been revised since January 2020 and risk mitigation controls had not been formally reviewed. The minor compliance issues it identified mainly related to record-keeping, and two of the open-cut mine's largest environmental risks — its waste rock dump and tailings storage facility — received near-perfect compliance scores. While concluding fish in the region were safe to eat, the report said metals above safe levels were detected in two fish species in a creek within the mining lease boundary. However, it said there was only an ""extremely low risk"" to human health from consuming fish in the area. The mine's acting general manager, Adam Hatfield, has welcomed the report. ""The Independent Monitor's positive findings about our environmental performance and the continued good health of the McArthur River are a testament to the ongoing progress we've made in recent years,"" he wrote in a statement. The ABC has previously revealed that the department sought a lower environmental security bond for the mine than the one the company itself calculated, raising questions about the relationship between the mine and the department regulating it. The department also approved a change to the mine while the government was in caretaker mode. The mine said it directly employs about 1,200 people and contributed $600 million to the economy last year.

13,Your home could be 'uninsurable' by 2030. Here are the top 10 electorates most at risk,environment," Science Climate change means 1 in 25 homes could become uninsurable by 2030, report warns For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency About one in 25 Australian homes are at high risk of becoming effectively uninsurable by 2030, according to a new Climate Council report based on analysis by a climate risk assessment group. That number rises to more than one in 10 homes for some of the most affected regions, including parts of Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Greater Shepparton, Ballina and Port Adelaide. The report authors warn that Australia is heading for an ""insurability crisis"" as climate change increases the risk of worse weather extremes, resulting in ""skyrocketing"" insurance premiums. ""We're talking about half a million properties — it's not insignificant,"" said Nicki Hutley, report co-author and economist with the Climate Council. ""This has implications for every single taxpayer in Australia."" Of the top 10 electorates to be impacted, most (80 per cent) are due to the increasing insurance risk posed by riverine flooding, according to the ""Uninsurable Nation"" report, which was released on Tuesday. Bushfire and surface-water flooding, or overland flooding not associated with river swelling, also feature prominently in pushing insurance premiums higher in the coming years. When a property becomes ""effectively uninsurable"", it means the insurance premiums are so high as to be unaffordable to the average home owner, according to Karl Mallon from Climate Valuation, who provided the Climate Council with the data. Once there is more than a 1 per cent chance in any given year of a property incurring major damage from an extreme weather event, that's when premiums start to escalate, Dr Mallon said. ""Once you exceed that threshold, typically the costs start to increase; so instead of paying $1,000 a year, you get $3,000 a year and it climbs — we've seen premiums of $30,000 a year,"" he said. ""Essentially, we stand by the view that once you get above these levels, there will be many people who cannot afford this insurance."" Had trouble getting insurance for your home? We'd love to hear from you. You can contact us at science@abc.net.au. Had trouble getting insurance for your home? We'd love to hear from you. You can contact us at science@abc.net.au. Queensland is projected to be the hardest-hit state, with up to 193,000 properties (6.5 per cent of the total number) deemed to be at high risk of uninsurability by 2030, followed by New South Wales with more than 148,000 properties. The findings were based on a business-as-usual, high emissions outlook for climate change. Dr Mallon said what banks and insurance companies choose to base their premiums on varies, but they're required to factor in business-as-usual forecasts. Let's break down the climate change policies of the major parties: Coalition, Labor and Greens. ""The kind of guidance coming out from the governing regulatory bodies in Australia and around the world, they almost all insist that every company have a view on the high emissions scenarios,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, that's where we're tracking, is along those pathways."" At this stage, the high emissions scenario is looking likely through to 2030, Ms Hutley said. ""What we call the high emissions, worst-case scenario is the path we're currently on with no pathway adjustments,"" she said. ""This is actually what we're facing down if nothing happens [and] with the 2030 scenario, most of that [warming] is already baked in."" The report also includes an interactive map with moderate and best-case emissions scenarios, where users can explore outcomes through to 2100. ""Even under the moderate scenario, things still don't look that great,"" Ms Hutley said. In the federal electorate of Nicholls in Victoria, which includes Shepparton, Moira, Campaspe, Mitchell and parts of Strathbogie Shire, as many as one in four houses are predicted to move into the insurance ""high risk"" category by 2030. Strathbogie mayor Laura Binks said her community was ""already living the reality of climate change right now"", but she was still surprised to see how at-risk the Strathbogie Shire could become. ""Seeing this report, yes, it's the high emissions, worst-case scenario outlook for our community, but it's really alarming and arresting,"" Councillor Binks said. In 2021, Strathbogie became the 100th council in Australia to declare a climate emergency. Councillor Binks said this report had reinforced the need to get emissions down. As images of flooding fill our bulletins, it's important to remember that this isn't happening in a vacuum. Extreme weather is going to get more common under climate change. ""We'd absolutely welcome meaningful [climate] action at the state and federal level that the scientists are telling us we have to take,"" she said. Councillor Binks said there were already a number of climate-positive projects in the Strathbogie Shire, including a microgrid at Euroa and carbon-neutral wineries, but that building resilience against future extreme weather events posed a bigger challenge. ""It's certainly a part of the work that our operations and engineering teams are doing, is looking at ways we can build resilience,"" she said. ""[But] the challenge we have at Strathbogie is we have a large area but a fairly small rate base."" That means the council can't generate the revenue locally to invest in expensive infrastructure projects. ""What we'd love to see is more meaningful support and partnering from state and federal governments,"" Councillor Binks said. ""We don't want to see rural and regional places get left behind."" Our changing climate could soon make it harder to get a mortgage on the Queensland coast. We had three properties assessed, with mixed results. Climate Valuation calculated the data used in the report with a program that input variables including flood mapping, elevation, and forest cover, combined with global climate models, to assess the ""upper range"" of risks posed to every address in Australia. Assuming an average house cost of $314,000 (it was $320,000 last year according to the ABS), they then calculated what is called the MVAR, or maximum value at risk, for each property. Houses that scored an MVAR of 1 per cent, which means that extreme weather was likely to cost them on average 1 per cent of the value of their property each year — $3,140 based on the assumed average house cost — were deemed to be at ""high risk"" of becoming effectively uninsurable. Because extreme weather events happen with a degree of random probability, jumps in insurance premiums can be difficult to predict. However, Dr Mallon says that, in general, insurance companies and banks have been underestimating the growing risk of climate change. ""Unfortunately, we think it's not going to be a smooth curve from here over the next five years,"" he said. ""We think there's going to be some bumpy corrections."" What people need to understand, he said, is that while a 1 or 2 per cent chance of an extreme weather event might sound low to the property owner, to an insurer, that could be an unacceptable risk and cause for boosting premiums. ""Everyone is saying, 'What's the statistical probability of an extreme weather event?'"" Dr Mallon said. ""If I was a home owner, I'm more worried about what the insurers and banks are going to do, than what is the possibility of an event coming through.""

A spokesperson for the Insurance Council of Australia says climate change is ""worsening extreme weather events, which has implications for affordability and availability of insurance"". ""At present there is no area of Australia that is uninsurable, although there are some locations where there are clearly affordability and availability concerns,"" the spokesperson said. ""Insurance [assesses] risk, and that means that for those in flood-prone or cyclone-prone locations, cover can be costly. ""In late February, ICA released our election policy document, Building a More Resilient Australia, which states that the next Federal Government must increase its investment to $200 million a year and this must be matched by the states and territories, in line with a 2014 Productivity Commission recommendation.""

14,A reckoning is coming for Australia's largest river system,environment," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes A reckoning is coming for the Murray-Darling Basin and its $13 billion management plan. Very few people believe water will be found in time For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The lakes and dams are full, the crops bountiful, and birds and fish are returning, but a reckoning is coming for Australia's largest river system. Delivery of the $13 billion Murray-Darling Basin Plan, arguably one of the country's largest and most ambitious environmental reforms, hangs in the balance with just two years to go before major water-saving deadlines must be met. Very few people who have been paying attention believe the water will be found in time. What happens then has all sides of politics divided. For too long, too much water was taken out of the rivers and the environment suffered. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has remained controversial ever since its introduction back in 2012. So, why is it back on the agenda? In 2012 a new way of doing business was legislated – with bipartisan support — and a plan was set about how much water could be withdrawn from the Murray-Darling Basin. The plan says 2,750 gigalitres, more than five Sydney Harbours worth of water, must be given back to the rivers. Plus, an additional 450GL should be recovered through what is called efficiency projects. South Australia, at the bottom of the system, said it would only sign on to the plan if the 450GL was included. The deadline for both targets is set for June 2024. In 2018, the federal and state water ministers agreed to set a strict criteria about how the 450GL could be recovered. They'd essentially decided that too many regional communities were suffering because there was less water, less money and fewer people in the towns where the water use had changed. The ministers agreed no water could be put toward the 450GL target unless it could be done in a way that met their criteria to ensure no socio-economic harm to communities. It's unclear how legally-binding that criteria is. So far just 2GL has been recovered toward the target. Now federal Labor says it would ensure delivery of the 450GL for the environment if it is elected later this month. And it hasn't ruled out buying the water back from farmers — a prospect that outrages the Victorian Labor Water Minister Lisa Neville. Ms Neville was one of those who led the charge to have the water ministers agree to the criteria by which the 450GL could be recovered. She vehemently opposes buybacks. The Nationals agree. Last year, backbench Nationals used debate in the federal parliament to break from cabinet and attempt to legislate to axe the 450GL, outlaw any more Commonwealth buybacks and extend the deadline for water-saving projects beyond 2024. ANALYSIS: Catch-up on the latest from the campaign trail on Friday with Annabel Crabb It failed and spectacularly embarrassed Coalition partners the Liberals, whose South Australian senators promptly issued a statement re-instating their support to deliver the legislated Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full, and on time. This is how it looks so far. Victorian Labor and the federal Nationals are in lockstep. The Nationals and Liberals are at odds with each other. And federal Labor is promising to deliver more water for the environment by ignoring the state water minister's criteria but ""working with the states"". All allegiances are being tested, but for now, the federal Water Minister Keith Pitt, who was returned to cabinet in return for the Nationals' support for Australia's net zero by 2050 target, is resolute the Coalition government policy is not to buy back water from farmers to meet the water savings deadlines. ""It is the government's position that there'll be no more buybacks. From the Prime Minister down we have that commitment,"" Mr Pitt told the ABC earlier this year. In the same interview, Mr Pitt said there would be some water savings projects that would not be completed on time; another sentiment not shared by his Liberal colleagues. Away from the 450GL, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan states that 605GL must be recovered for the environment from water-saving projects managed by the state governments. The idea is that by re-engineering weirs or removing silt from lakes more water savings would be made. The Millennium drought didn't just expose river beds — it also exposed deep tensions between environmental and economic sustainability. This too will need a miracle if it is to occur by the middle of 2024, progress on some of the projects is so slow it is almost non-existent. One project, at the Menindee Lakes, was to recover 106GL but has been delayed and re-scoped. Last October, then NSW water minister Melinda Pavey warned the overhauled project would not make 106GL in water savings, nor would it be completed on time. If the project does go ahead it would likely recover significantly less water, with one insider suggesting 40GL at best. Ms Pavey has since been dumped from the NSW water portfolio and the community is yet to be convinced of the latest approach. Another project, known as 'constraints management' would see water flow through low-lying areas and requires almost 4000 landholder agreements to be reached. A decade into the Plan and so far not one landholder agreement has been signed. That's zip, zero, zilch, nada. If not for the return of healthy rains in recent years you might expect a riot over the uncertainty in the communities that depend upon and enjoy the rivers. Last month, Australia's Agriculture Minister David Littleproud, also a National, said if the Plan's water-saving deadlines needed to be extended, they should be. But with South Australian Liberals opposed to NSW and Victorian Nationals it is unclear how the Coalition would reach consensus within its own ranks. The matter could very well be a consideration when the Coalition agreement is re-negotiated, post-election. From here, it looks like hell is more likely to freeze over before Victorian Water Minister Lisa Neville and federal Shadow Water Minister Terri Butler see eye-to-eye on basin policy and the path to consensus for Labor is just as murky. The challenge for either a federal Coalition or Labor government to convince state water ministers – who haven't met for more than a year – about the best way forward seems almost insurmountable. All the while climate change projections see less water flowing into the rivers. Australia's largest river system is home to more than 2 million people, including those from more than 40 First Nations. It provides drinking water for more than 3.5 million people, is home to 16 internationally recognised wetlands and produces more than $30 billion in agriculture and tourism each year. The Murray-Darling Basin is for all Australians to share. How that is done won't be a major issue in this year's federal election, but perhaps it should be.

15,Shearwater shock: Dozens of dead birds found in coastal town for fourth straight year,environment,"  Dozens of dead shearwaters found in Port Fairy for fourth year in a row For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Dozens of dead juvenile short-tailed shearwaters have been found strewn across a lawn outside a popular tourist attraction in south-west Victoria for a fourth straight year. The short-tailed shearwater, or mutton bird, is one of Australia's most common and hardy birds. Each year the birds clock up more than 32,000 kilometres, following the warm weather between the northern and southern hemispheres as they chase an ""eternal summer"". About 50 juvenile short-tailed shearwaters were this week found strewn across a lawn near a popular breeding ground at Griffiths Island in Port Fairy, three-and-a-half hours west from Melbourne. The cause of death remains unknown, and Victoria's Department of Environment and Moyne Shire Council have been notified. Port Fairy's short-tailed shearwater population has endured a horror run over the past four years. Alarm bells were raised in 2019 when the 40,000-strong colony was uncharacteristically late to arrive to its south-west home. A significant number of shearwater deaths were recorded that summer and again in 2020. Things were looking brighter last year, with colony numbers bouncing back before this weekend's latest kill. It is understood the juvenile birds were expected to leave the island this week to follow their parents north to Alaska for the summer. The Moyne Shire Council sent staff to collect the birds on Sunday. ""It’s understood artificial light may have an impact on the fledglings,"" a council spokesperson said. ""As such, council has taken steps to reduce artificial light in the area around Griffiths Island. ""The light in the rotunda at the entrance to the island causeway will be switched off until after the fledglings have migrated."" The council is also investigating if other lighting in the area can be lowered or switched off during fledging, while still ensuring safety of the public. The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said its investigations remained ongoing. ""The cause of the deaths isn’t known. DELWP officers have collected a sample of the birds for assessment,” a spokesperson said.

16,They suck your electricity while you sleep. What you need to know about vampire appliances,environment,"  They suck your electricity and money while you sleep. What you need to know about vampire appliances For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency No, they're not Twilight-themed appliances. However, like Edward Cullen, appliances left on stand-by are a big red flag. Working behind the scenes while you're sleeping, vampire appliances are consuming energy even when they're turned off. So what are they and will turning them off at the wall make any difference to your power bills? Let's find out. These particular appliances enter a stand-by mode rather than fully powering down, meaning they continue to consume energy even while turned off. Essentially, it means you're paying for electricity that you're not even using. According to Canstar Blue's estimates, appliances on stand-by could cost you up to 10 per cent of your electricity bill: That's more than $100 annually. This depends on various factors, including the number of appliances left on stand-by, each appliance's efficiency rating and the rate you pay for electricity. Nevertheless, it's unnecessary power usage that's costing you more. Appliance Hourly standby usage Annual standby cost Gaming console 5.4W $13.14 Washing machine 1 – 6W $2.62 – $14.90 Dishwasher 3W $7.99 Source: Canstar Blue If an appliance has a remote control, LED light, touch-on button or similar function, then it uses stand-by electricity. Another way you can tell is if you can feel heat coming from an appliance that you aren't using, such as your laptop charger when it's not plugged into your laptop. Why do they do this? Because these devices constantly run background functions while on stand-by. Wi-Fi checks, downloading content and continually having to prepare for remote, touch or voice activation all contribute to stand-by electricity usage. While the amount of electricity that feeds into most devices is minuscule, some devices may cost you more than others. In 2021, Canstar Blue examined the stand-by costs of common household appliances. Its findings revealed some of the most expensive appliances and devices were: Yes. The best way to save on stand-by costs is to make a habit of switching appliances and devices off at the power outlet when they're not in use. Phones at 100 per cent battery still plugged into chargers, cordless vacuum cleaners sitting quietly in the corner, your Google Home patiently waiting for your daily ""What's the weather today?"" question — individually, these devices on stand-by draw a small amount of energy. However, Choice's home products expert, Denis Gallagher, says that, if you've got more than a dozen appliances around the house, it's going to start adding up. ""We've seen an average of 15 to 17 connected devices in the home in 2020."" ""In just a few years time, that amount is going to double,"" he said. And let's not forget the bigger cost: Choice says the stand-by energy used across Australia collectively amounts to tonnes of extra greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere. Ultimately, it pays to shop around and check the star rating of appliances. The price of electricity is the cheapest it has been in almost a decade, and average annual household bills are going down. But consumers could be paying even less. Here's how. The Australian Energy Star Rating System is intended to indicate electricity usage running costs. However, it also provides a useful guide to stand-by costs. Essentially, the more energy efficient an appliance is, the less electricity it will use on stand-by. You can modify the settings on some smart televisions and smart consoles to minimise their stand-by functionality. You can do this to stop them from running background functions, such as scanning for Wi-Fi. Some electricity boards can detect when an appliance has entered stand-by mode and will cut its electricity feed entirely. It can also detect when you’re trying to turn the device back on and recommence its feed of electricity.

17,Masked owl habitat concerns fail to stop tailings dam work in Tarkine rainforest,environment,"  Bob Brown Foundation loses federal court bid to stop MMG mine tailing dams in Tarkine over masked owl concerns For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency An environmental group has lost its Federal Court bid to halt preliminary works for a controversial mine tailings dam inside the takayna/Tarkine rainforest in Tasmania's west. The Bob Brown Foundation argued mining company MMG's work would cause ""irreversible damage"" to the habitat of the rare Tasmanian masked owl. But the move was dismissed by Justice Mark Moshinsky, telling the court an injunction restricting the company from undertaking the proposed action altogether ""appears to go too far"". In January, the federal Environment Department found design and assessment work from MMG did not require approval under the Commonwealth's Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). Despite that, the company had to include measures to protect various species, including wedge-tailed eagles and Tasmanian devils, but not the masked owl. Justice Moshinsky told the court it was unnecessary to impose an injunction because MMG had now given an undertaking to protect the masked owl. ""Had MMG not offered to give the undertaking, I would have considered it appropriate to make an order restraining MMG,"" he said. MMG has agreed to apply a 15-metre exclusion zone to trees suitable for masked owl nesting, with the trees to be marked with tape and their GPS coordinates recorded. The foundation's campaign manager, Jenny Weber, said it was ""not a good day"" for threatened species in Tasmania. ""It's a pro-mining decision over the environment,"" she said. ""Compromising any part of nature is just not acceptable. It's so important to us to keep places like takayna/Tarkine intact."" Tasmania's Rosebery mine needs to build a new tailings dam or risk closure, costing 500 jobs. But some are standing against the weight of public opinion and likelihood of arrest to protect the environment. However, Ms Weber said the court decision had put the Chinese-owned company on notice. ""We will be in those forests to monitor the behaviour and activities of MMG and we will be absolutely noting if they go outside their undertakings,"" she said. ""Every time MMG enters into these forests, it is a step towards building this enormous tailings waste dump."" She said it was ""back to the barricades"" for conservationists who would continue protesting. The foundation's bid to overturn federal government approval for the tailings dam will be heard in July. Tasmania's Rosebery mine, which has been operating since the 1930s, produces zinc, copper, and lead concentrates, as well as gold ore. The mine has two existing tailings dams, but a new one is required for the mine to survive past 2024. South Marionoak, across the Pieman River from the Rosebery mine, is where MMG has proposed to build the dam, with a footprint of 285 hectares. In a statement, MMG general manager Steve Scott said he welcomed the decision. ""It confirms that MMG has, at all times, acted legally under the strict terms and conditions set by the federal government,"" he said. ""We are taking specific and conservative steps to avoid impacts on masked owl habitat, including applying an exclusion zone around any potential habitat trees.""

20,'Do not eat' advisory for shellfish in entire Gippsland Lakes region as toxic algal bloom grows,environment,"  Blue-green algae outbreak at Gippsland Lakes grows, with only Lake Wellington safe for swimming For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A toxic blue-green algae bloom in Victoria's Gippsland Lakes is growing, prompting authorities to upgrade warnings. Lake Wellington is now the only part of the inland waterway network considered safe for direct contact with humans or pets. A ""do not eat"" advisory for shellfish remains in place for the entire system, including for shellfish from Lake Wellington. Fishers have also been told to gut and gill whole fish before eating them. A warning from the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said it was not yet known how long the bloom would last. ""There is no definite length of time that these species of algae will remain in the lakes,"" it stated. Contact with blue-green algae can cause allergic reactions, gastroenteritis and nausea. Monash University biochemistry professor Perran Cook said the current outbreak was not the worst the system had seen. ""While significant, this is considered a medium outbreak,"" he said. ""In East Gippsland we experienced a far worse outbreak in 1992."" Professor Cook said current water temperature, salinity and nutrient levels were ideal for algal growth. ""Algal blooms are a naturally occurring phenomenon and occurred prior to colonisation,"" he said. Since the artificial opening of the lakes to the ocean at Lakes Entrance in the late 19th century, many have questioned its effect on algal blooms. ""It's also likely the permanent opening of the entrance has had a mitigating affect overall,"" Professor Cook said.

21,"Chinese resort developer Freesoul fined $650,000 for damaging Fijian mangroves and reef",environment,"  Chinese resort developer Freesoul fined $650,000 for damaging Fijian mangroves and reef For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A Chinese company that dug a channel through mangroves and a coral reef to provide access to a multi-million-dollar resort and casino development on a Fijian island has been fined $FJ1 million ($650,000) by the High Court in Suva. In the landmark judgment handed down on Thursday, Justice Daniel Goundar also ordered Freesoul Real Estate Development to pay a $FJ1.4 million bond, refundable once the damage had been remediated. The company was found guilty in April last year of two counts of undertaking unauthorised development on Malolo, a tourist island in Fiji's west, where it removed mangrove trees and destroyed extensive parts of a reef to create the boat channel. Justice Goundar said the company had ""caused substantial harm to the environment"" and the sentence reflected the ""community's disapproval for the offender's lack of respect for the environment"". He added there was ""no comparable case in Fiji"" for sentencing purposes. ""The offender had no regard for the marine life and corals that existed in the area where the channel was dug,"" he said. ""The structural damage done to the area is irreversible."" While the affected areas could not be restored to their natural states, he said the damage could be mitigated with works with an estimated cost of about $FJ1.3 million. Freesoul's lawyer David Toganivalu told the ABC the company had not yet decided whether it would appeal the judgment. ""Definitely they want to start the project again,"" Mr Toganivalu said. ""They will need to work with the Department of Environment to see how to rehabilitate the place again."" ""The fine was a bit too high, but that was to be expected,"" he added. Local media quoted Environment Minister Mahendra Reddy as saying the case would serve as a deterrent to other developers failing to comply with environment laws. Navrin Fox, an Australian who has a long-term lease on land neighbouring the development site and who had raised concerns about Freesoul, said he was ""surprised and happy"" the fine was substantial. ""It's good to see the Fijian government and the court system standing up for what's right,"" he said. ""I think that they could go one step further and cancel Freesoul's lease, because they have shown negligence. ""To dig that much reef out and to dump it in front of our lease land and do that without any authority to do it is just pure negligence, and they knew what they were doing."" Fiji's Prime Minister apologises for the arrests, saying ""rogue"" police officers were to blame, and praising media for exposing a Chinese company's ""illegal environmental destruction"". Wildlife Conservation Society Melanesia director Stacy Jupiter also welcomed the sentence but she too said the fine did not go far enough. ""This bond of $FJ1.4 million isn't going to be nearly enough to cover the restoration,"" she said. ""You'll never be able to get back the value of services that has been lost because this channel has been created. ""It takes reefs hundreds to thousands of years to be able to build structures of the size and scale of which they've destroyed and so you can't rehabilitate this. ""No amount of money can rehabilitate what's been taken away."" The story was brought to national and international attention in 2019 when three New Zealand journalists were arrested after being denied an interview with the director of the company Freesoul at its offices in the capital, Suva. They spent the night on the floor of a Fijian police station before being released the following day with the Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama apologising for their treatment.

22,"Landfill the size of 50 football fields burns in Delhi, engulfing city in acrid smoke amid heatwave",environment,"  Delhi engulfed in smoke as landfill blaze rages amid heatwave For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Acrid smoke hung over New Delhi for a second day after a massive landfill caught fire during a scorching heat wave, forcing informal waste workers to endure hazardous conditions. The landfill in northern Delhi's Bhalswa is taller than a 17-storey building and covers an area bigger than 50 football fields. Waste workers who live in nearby homes had emptied onto the streets on Tuesday evening (local time). However, by Wednesday morning, the thousands of people who live and work at the landfill had begun the dangerous process of trying to salvage garbage from the fire. ""There's a fire every year. It is not new. There is risk to life and livelihood, but what do we do?"" asked Bhairo Raj, 31, an informal waste worker who lives next to the landfill. He said that his children studied there and he could not afford to leave. The Indian capital, like the rest of South Asia, is in the midst of a record-shattering heatwave that, experts said, was a catalyst for the landfill fire. Three other landfills around the Indian capital have also caught fire in recent weeks. The landfill in the latest fire was planned for closure more than a decade ago, but more than 2,300 tons of the city's garbage is still dumped there every day. The organic waste in the landfill decays, resulting in a build-up of highly combustible methane gas. ""With high temperatures, this spontaneous combustion will take place,"" said Ravi Agarwal, the director of Toxics Link, a New Delhi-based advocacy group that focuses on waste management. Several fire engines rushed to the landfill to try to douse the fire. At night, the landfill resembled a burning mountain and it smouldered until early morning. March was the hottest month in India in more than a century and April has been similarly scorching. Temperatures crossed 43 degrees Celsius in several cities and forecasters expect them to continue rising. ""India's current heatwave has been made hotter by climate change,"" said Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute in Imperial College London. She said that, unless the world stops adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, such heatwaves would become even more common.

23,North-west gets eco-tourism boost as state allocates $500k for adventure trail,environment,"  $500,000 Victorian government funding to plan, design Kerang-Koondrook Rail Trail For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency What was once an important supply chain for early colonialists living on the Victorian-New South Wales border is set to become a popular outdoor adventure attraction for the Gannawarra Shire. The Victorian government has handed over $500,000 to start the planning and design work for a 22-kilometre cycling and walking trail between Kerang and Koondrook. The trail will follow parts of the former Kerang-Koondrook Tramways route, which delivered supplies to Kerang from the Koondrook Wharf, transported downriver by paddle steamer. Built and operated by the Shire of Swan Hill (later the Shire of Kerang) from 1889 until 1952, when Victorian Railways took over, the tramway was privately owned, had no signalling and had rails of lighter construction. Gannawarra Shire Mayor Charlie Gillingham remembers the tramways running when he was a child. ""When I was young, going to school, students used to travel on the tramway to Kerang."" Victorian Railways operated passenger services on the line until 1976, and freight services ended in 1978. The Koondrook Wharf was dismantled by the Marine Board in the late 50s, and in 1975 the rail turntable was removed, but a replica steam train is located at the old Koondrook station, just across the road from the wharf today. In recent years, redevelopment of the wharf and an emphasis on eco-tourism and outdoor adventure along the Murray River have created new opportunities for the region. ""We do focus a lot on nature-based tourism, and with the new wharf in Koondrook, glamping and the new all-abilities playground, Koondrook and the Gannawarra are going places,"" Cr Gillingham said. The Kerang and Koondrook Rail Trail will eventually extend from Kerang out to the Ramsar-listed Lake Charm and Reedy Lake. It will form part of the wider Murray River Adventure Trail — a multi-sport adventure trail that runs the length of the Murray River from Lake Hume, near Albury-Wodonga in the east to Mildura and Wentworth in the west. That trail takes in river red gum forests and major sites along the Murray, providing visitors the opportunity to experience the iconic river in its natural environment through active recreation. The land-based trail is about 1,040 km, while the water-based trail (for kayakers and other craft) is 1,390 km. State MP Mark Gepp said it was a real asset for northern Victoria and would turn the Murray River into a ""magnificent"" tourist opportunity. ""Tourism doesn't start and stop at a border. The Murray River doesn't recognise a postcode"", Mr Gepp said. ""It's about connecting all these different projects, these different amenities and infrastructure in the Gannawarra, which aren't done in isolation with each other but are designed to connect up to all the wonderful things going on here."" Loddon Murray Cycling Club president Brent McKnight said that once completed, the Kerang-Koondrook Rail Trail would be great for local cyclists and tourists alike. ""A lot of our members do, when they go off and visit different areas, take on the rail trails,"" he said. ""But unfortunately, we've got to travel a fair way to do that, so this will be new for us. It'll be fantastic."" He said it should be a good way to connect people who might not be avid riders, with the 22-kilometre length easily achievable in a little over an hour ""depending on which way the wind is blowing"". ""Most rail trails are not so much a sealed surface but made of a compacted gravel which does make it difficult to use a proper road bike, "" Mr McKnight said. ""However, the introduction of a lot of mountain bikes and what we call gravel bikes, which is a bit of hybrid bike, is ideally suited to a rail trail. ""The biggest thing we see about a rail trail like this is it's all off-road, which means it's much, much safer, especially for young families to take on because the road here can be quite busy with a lot of trucks."" Gannawarra Shire Council's chief executive Tom O'Reilly also has high hopes for the project. ""Once completed, this project will drive economic growth to the region through increased visitation and expenditure, while enhancing community wellbeing and livability, and employment opportunities for local trades and indigenous workforce through construction and new product development,"" he said. The state government has fast tracked the funding for the project to support recovery in the Gannawarra shire and northern border region, which was heavily impacted by travel restrictions during the first two years of the pandemic.

24,Freezing turtle hatchlings mistake Gold Coast homes for ocean,environment,"  Loggerhead turtles rescued from Palm Beach after mistaking homes for horizon For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Dozens of turtle hatchlings are lucky to be alive after they were found in a ""sorry state"" on a sand dune at a popular Gold Coast beach. The 40 loggerhead turtles were found near a nest in the beachside suburb of Palm Beach on Sunday. The underweight babies were disorientated by nearby house lights, according to turtle rehabilitator and Turtle Watch Gold Coast head Siobhán Houlihan. Ms Houlihan is urging people to turn their lights off during nesting season, and wants to see more done to dim construction lights. She said without volunteer groups, the entire clutch would have died. The turtles were transferred to Sea World to ""warm up"" before being released on Monday. Four of the babies died, but Ms Houlihan said the number could have been much higher. ""Honestly, if we hadn't intervened and nobody had found them, they would have just perished upon the journey,"" she said. ""Most of them were cold-stunned, weak and lethargic — most of them were on their back, they were stuck in the in the dune grass … going towards the street lights."" She said the turtles weighed about 20 grams and that a healthy weight was about 24 grams. ""They were in a pretty sorry state when we when we did find them,"" she said. It is the third nest found by Turtle Watch volunteers on the Gold Coast this season. Another loggerhead nest was found at Main Beach, as well as a green sea turtle clutch at Palm Beach. The Gold Coast's residential population is expected to swell to one million over the next two decades and construction is booming to keep pace. Ms Houlihan said it was common for turtles to get confused when they hatched near popular beachside suburbs. ""When they come out of a nest, they're looking for the lowest light horizon, which is normally the ocean — they know that the moon reflects off it,"" she said. ""But then obviously they're seeing these bright lights, so they can't actually see … the ocean. ""So they're going towards the house lights."" Turtles face a number of obstacles on Australia's coast, including construction, weather, plastic pollution and shark nets. Ms Houlihan said the Turtle Watch program was helping, but education and practical changes were crucial. ""There's a slogan … 'Reduce the glow to help the turtles go,'"" she said. ""If we can educate the locals that live on Palm Beach there, that during nesting and hatching seasons in the evening, close your curtains or turn lights off that you don't need. ""It would be great if we could see some more environmentally friendly lighting along those along those beaches. ""Having [hatching] events like this help to have those conversations and we can definitely have the conversations with the relevant people that can make those decisions."" In a statement, a Gold Coast City Council spokesperson said ecological assessments were undertaken ""as part of the design process for all city beachside projects that require lighting, such as along our oceanways."" Ms Houlihan said there was always more people could do. ""We can look at reducing our impact as best we can, just in all things in life,"" she said.
