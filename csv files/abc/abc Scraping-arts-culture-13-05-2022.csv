0,"$100,000 Archibald Prize goes to portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens by Blak Douglas",arts-culture,"  Archibald Prize won by Blak Douglas for portrait of artist Karla Dickens, the second time an Indigenous artist has won For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Dhungutti artist Blak Douglas (aka Adam Hill) has won the $100,000 Archibald Prize for his portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens — the second Indigenous artist to win the prize in its 101 years, following Western Arrernte artist Vincent Namatjira in 2020. This is Douglas's fifth time as an Archibald finalist, and accepting the prize at the Art Gallery of NSW ceremony, the self-taught painter said: ""This painting represents 20 years of taking the risk of pursuing a dream [and] surrendering normalised employment. And I'm sure many of my artist colleagues can relate to that."" Douglas painted Dickens, a friend and in his words ""legendary practitioner"", knee-deep in the muddy floodwaters of her hometown in Lismore, Bundjalung Country — holding a leaking pail of water in each hand, and looking grumpy. His painting reflects on the damage and after-effects of the devastating February and March floods in the Northern Rivers. ""I've been up there [to Bundjalung Country] several times; it's a war zone,"" Douglas told ABC News. ""And so to be able to further aid some of my dearest, closest friends up there, through this win — not only metaphorically, but also financially — it's a big plus."" The portrait, titled Moby Dickens, also speaks to Dickens's frustration with the government response to the February and March floods. Speaking to ABC Arts in April, she said: ""[I told Adam] 'As long as you make it grumpy. I want to be grumpy.'"" ""If [the painting] makes one more person aware of what's happened where I live, I'm really grateful for that,"" Dickens said. Speaking via live video link from her home, during the ceremony, Dickens said she was ""over the moon"", and thanked her friend for ""acknowledging everybody up here on Bundjalung Country that has gone through so much"". ""I'm so proud of you, Adam. Such a killer painting,"" she added. The judges also highly commended artist Jude Rae's portrait of Australian engineer and inventor Saul Griffith. The $40,000 Sulman Prize (for ""subject painting, genre painting or mural project""), meanwhile, was awarded to artist duo Claire Healy and Sean Cordeiro for their mixed-media painting Raiko and Shuten-dōji, depicting the fight between the warrior Raiko and the demon Shuten-dōji. The $50,000 Wynne Prize for landscape painting went to Nicholas Harding for his work Eora. Accepting the award, Douglas acknowledged his ancestors: ""My Irish Scot, German and English mob, as well as … the Dhungutti of mid-north coast New South Wales."" ""This is incredibly historic, given that I'm the first Koori to paint a Koori to win the Archibald Prize; the first First Nations New South Wales Aboriginal artist [to win]."" Douglas is a self-taught painter whose pop art aesthetic is informed by training in graphic design, illustration and photography. ""My dear family have been supportive all the way along through this career to get to this point,"" he told assembled onlookers. ""Particularly the matriarchs in my family; women are a very strong part of my family."" Speaking to ABC News afterwards, he described the path to his winning painting as ""a long haul"". ""It felt like building part of the Great Wall [of China] just painting this thing; it's quite a task to paint something that big."" It's Douglas's largest Archibald entry so far, and he said ""whilst Karla is physically diminutive in stature, it's important that we memorialised [her in this way]"". ""And that's what I try and do with my paintings often — because we need to memorialise First Nations people en masse."" Douglas was previously a finalist for the Archibald Prize in 2020 (with a portrait of young Arrernte and Garrwa activist Dujuan Hoosan), 2019 (with a portrait of Bidjigal artist Esme Timbery), 2018 (Wiradjuri artist Uncle Roy Kennedy) and 2015 (Budjedi elder and ""Aboriginal cultural entertainer"" Uncle Max Eulo). ""It's nice in any way to honour another artist,"" Douglas told ABC News last week. ""We are a minority in terms of vocations in this country."" At the award ceremony, he said he was ""proudly represent[ing] a legion of creatives consistently dealt the rough end of the stick, unfortunately … But that may change with a change of government, perhaps"". Exhibitions for the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes will open on Saturday May 14 at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Tops Arts & Culture headlines.

1,Adnate mural immortalises 'strong-willed' Yorta Yorta women,arts-culture,"  Matt Adnate immortalises two remarkable Yorta Yorta elders as part of Shepparton mural project For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Yorta Yorta elder Uncle Lance James feels fortunate to have up grown up alongside his 13 brothers and sisters during an era when many First Nations children were denied that right. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains images and names of people who have died. His late mother Aunty Mary James and another pioneering community leader the late Aunty Violet Harrison have been immortalised in a mural on the Goulburn Valley Water office in Shepparton. ""It's a great location for these two giants, who raised 27 children between them — amazing, isn't it?"" Uncle Lance said. ""Aunty Violet had 13 children, my mum had 14, so that speaks for itself, to raise all of us, not to be taken away back in the days of the Stolen Generations and the removal of children."" The work by mural artist Matt Adnate is his fourth as part of the Greater Shepparton City Council and Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation's Aboriginal Street Art Project. ""To have this sort of concentration in a city like this just goes to show that you can really transform the environment,"" Adnate said. ""There's a lot of depth and meaning behind the people that I'm painting. These are really important people to the local community and it's been an absolute honour to keep coming back over all these years."" Aunty Violet and Aunty Mary were heavily involved in supporting the local Aboriginal community. Aunty Mary was a founding member for the Shepparton Aboriginal Funeral Fund and worked with police, housing and social welfare organisations, advocating for First Nations people. Other Yorta Yorta leaders already painted as part of the project include Uncle William Cooper, Pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls, Aunty Margaret Tucker, Nora 'Nanny' Charles, Private Daniel Cooper, Aunty Geraldine Briggs and Aunty Elizabeth Morgan. Both Aunty Violet and Aunty Mary were born at the Cummergunja Mission,  in 1906 and 1913 respectively. The mission was an Aboriginal reserve beside a bend in the Murray River on Yorta Yorta country in New South Wales, near the Victorian town of Barmah. In 1939, the mission was the site of the Cummeragunja Walk Off, a nine-month protest against the living conditions and management of the site. The Walk Off is described as the first mass strike of Aboriginal people in Australia. After leaving Cummergunja and moving to the neighbouring towns of Mooroopna and Shepparton, Aunty Violet and Aunty Mary went on to become founding members of Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-Operative and the Shepparton Aboriginal Keeping Place. Artist Tom Day returns to Gunditjmara Country in south-west Victoria to help paint a 30-metre-high mural of his great-grandfather and great uncles, granting them the place in history they have long been due. They advocated for better housing for their community at The Flats, a stretch of land between Shepparton and Mooroopna where Aboriginal people lived in poor conditions until the late 1950s. When Queen Elizabeth visited Shepparton in 1954, the local government installed hessian bags and curtains to block The Flats from view. Uncle Lance remembers walking across the bridge between Shepparton and Mooroopna in protest as a schoolboy, alongside his mother, Aunty Violet and their families. ""We wanted better housing. We wanted housing like everyone else,"" he said. ""We were able to get 11 buildings put up where Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-Operative started [and] that made a big difference."" Aunty Violet Harrison was a formative figure in her grandson Gary Cooper's life and he's thrilled to see her celebrated in the mural. ""I can't tell you the words to explain how I feel,"" Mr Cooper said. ""She was a pioneer growing up, she fought for justice and now she's being rewarded for it,"" he said. ""She was terrific, Nan. She was only a little lady but she was very strong-willed and very strong in her ways. ""I suppose you had to be back then. ""I think we've learned a lot from her growing up and I probably wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for her.""

2,From Gold Coast to Turin — Sheldon Riley's Eurovision journey,arts-culture,"  Australia's Sheldon Riley may be Not The Same but his Eurovision dreams are finally coming true in Turin For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Just over two months ago, an emotional Sheldon Riley achieved his long-time dream — a trip to Italy to represent Australia at the Eurovision Song Contest. Amid cheering crowds at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, Riley — a talented 23-year-old Filipino-Australian performer best known for his work on reality TV shows like The Voice and America's Got Talent — had earned top spot in Australia Decides with his power ballad Not The Same. And yet he quickly realised that while his dramatic, dark, industrial staging had worked on the Gold Coast, he would have to dream things up again if he wanted to make his mark at Eurovision in Turin. This week, all the thinking and planning since then comes to the moment of truth for his big Eurovision adventure, when Riley steps on stage at the PalaOlimpico and tries to qualify for the final of the global music extravaganza that is watched by up to 200 million people around the world every year. ""I won't say anything bad about Australia Decides, because I won. I could have been happier, but because of COVID there was a lot of setbacks, there was a lot of rehearsals we couldn't get to, and … just COVID-wise, it meant there was only so much creative control I was able to have,"" he told ABC before flying out for the contest. ""But the performance was too dark, it was too heavy. I learned a lot from Australia Decides, I realised my song isn't a sad song, it's not a negative song and it shouldn't be a song that's too heavy and emotionally driven in a negative sense. The song has a lot of light, it has a lot of hope. ""I think it shines really brightly for a lot of people who don't have a voice and I needed to present that on stage, and the whole dark thing, it's not the right staging for the song."" Riley calls Eurovision a ""juggernaut"" of a competition. It's the world's biggest live music event, and for competitors it's not just a case of winning their national final or being named as the performer of the song for Eurovision, then resting up before turning up in the host city to do the business. ""Eurovision season"" runs for months. Italy picks its winner after a huge music festival of their own, San Remo. Many of the songs are then tweaked between winning and the contest itself — sometimes to improve the arrangement, other times to get the length of the song down to three minutes. If they don't get to that time limit or under, it can't be performed at Eurovision. The other part is what could be termed the campaign element. There is no formal advertising for Eurovision, but performers do countless interviews in their own and other countries to raise the contest's profile. And then there are the ""pre-Eurovision parties"" that have become a big part of the lead-up, as various competitors go to places like London, Spain, the Netherlands and Israel to perform concert versions of their songs in front of tightly packed, noisy crowds in nightclubs or other venues. Riley went to two parties, in London and Tel Aviv — and it was an eye-opening experience for a number of reasons. ""It's still well and truly in the Eurovision bubble. Unfortunately I lost my voice in London, which really messed me up in London and Israel Calling, but I was still so happy to be there,"" he said. ""In the end you really don't know how big Eurovision is until you go to Europe and see how much people obsess over the whole thing. So it was nice to get an experience and a kind of taste test for what's coming."" The contest itself has changed markedly in recent years — with the proliferation of reality TV singing shows, a lot of entrants are either chosen via a reality show format, or are experienced in those type of shows. Among Australia's Eurovision entrants since 2015 have been inaugural Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian and 2006 runner-up Jessica Mauboy, and X-Factor winners Dami Im and Isaiah Firebrace. Now it's Riley, who has used shows in Australia and the United States to showcase his performing vision, which mixes big songs with a flamboyant image, striking fashion, jewellery and masks. He wrote his song for Eurovision years ago as a message to his younger self about the struggles of dealing with Asperger's Syndrome and feeling ""not the same"" in his appearance, his experience and how he related to the world. Riley's voice, both powerful and capable of fragility, has driven many a reality TV run, but on the Eurovision stage it packs a real punch. But is his grounding in reality TV on two continents an advantage for Eurovision? Not really, he says. ""I think a lot of people are comparing my experiences from The Voice — quite naturally — with all the reality TV I've done to Eurovision, [but] nothing quite has been able to prepare me for how big Eurovision actually is,"" he said. ""In some ways it's very similar to reality TV, but in most ways it's completely different. ""I mean, I've been prepping this for years and years — I've wanted this for such a long time. But this is the most unexpected show, you never know what is going to happen."" He describes Not the Same as ""the hardest song I've ever had to sing"", part of the reason he didn't want it as a Eurovision song in the first place. Eurovision was watched by 183 million viewers in 2021. Here's how you can watch it this year. ""I mean I've learned the song when I was 15, I feel like I know it, it hasn't really changed much since I wrote it. But it's also the hardest song I've ever had to sing — it's such a massive sing,"" he said. ""I think it's the only thing I'm kind of worried about, which is crazy because I've never had to worry about my voice — I've always just kind of trusted it would be OK. ""It's the only thing I'm really worried about, is getting the vocal perfect. It's not like the Eurovision we remember from five or 10 years ago, where it was all about how fun and exciting it was. ""[Now] everyone's a Eurovision expert, especially because of all these reality shows — everyone knows what good singing is, and everyone knows what a f***-up is. ""There's nowhere to hide on this stage, there's no autotune, there's no pre-record, it's just a massive song to sing."" Riley describes Not The Same as ""quite the storytelling song"". ""I wanted to capture little moments that people can rewatch and remember,"" he said. ""I don't want to do the same thing as everyone else. The outfit will be the statement piece of this performance in terms of what's visually happening. ""It's being made by Alin Le'Kal, who's a very incredible designer that I'm very honoured to work with. The dress weighs 40-plus kilos, the outfit … we're practising with sandbags to move around. ""I think it's about 180,000 crystals the outfit is covered in, and lots and lots of feathers."" Member of the Australian delegation — and director of SBS production partner Blink TV — Paul Clarke explains the challenges of a famous staging from 2019. ""When we first designed Kate Miller-Heidke's dress it looked beautiful, but it weighed about 25 kilograms and she couldn't climb the poles she was on in the dress. So it needed a major refurb,"" he said. ""We're not after quite as much [movement] of Sheldon, and he's actually quite a powerful young man — he's very strong."" Rehearsals at Eurovision are designed to get the artists used to the stage, and performing the song, but more to help coordinate movement on stage and the camera angles and effects used to create the visual performance. It's a reminder that although the contest has a live audience — which brings fans together from all around the world and is integral to the atmosphere of the occasion — this is, in the end, a very big TV show. Under a new agreement this year, first rehearsals at Eurovision are closed to press and fan media — causing some consternation — with exclusive clips and backstage chat released on TikTok. The first glimpse was frustratingly brief. There was the dress — white, not black, as at Australia Decides. There were steps of some sort and that was about all you could see. Backstage, Sheldon walked back afterwards, telling the camera: ""That was insane — I mean no-one should have to sing that song three times [in one rehearsal], right? Jesus."" ""I'm so grateful — I still can't believe I'm doing this."" Sacha Jean-Baptiste is the creative director for Australia's three-minute presentation to the world in Turin. She is something of a Eurovision-whisperer, having designed stagings for a number of big entries at the contest. Keep up with all the latest news from the Eurovision Song Contest, including: None of the entries she has worked on have yet won the contest, but that's not the point. She gets the vision part of Eurovision — and one of her creations from last year particularly caught the eye, and led to some ideas from Australia's organisers. ""When you think about what's possible there — Duncan [Laurence], the previous winner from the Netherlands, was literally sitting at a piano and he won Eurovision with just a huge orb behind him, an enormous light. Just the power of it and the simplicity of it worked,"" Clarke said. ""We've got a lot of lights at our disposal and I think one of the key performances for me, which was last year was Gjon's Tears from Switzerland [designed by Jean-Baptiste]. That was basically taking someone who was more introverted and taking them to a huge audience. ""Just the way that that was conceived was I thought really well done — it was like an internal monologue. I loved it, and there was a really simple set that went with that. ""In some ways, that's our model."" The accredited media have since seen the second rehearsals, and clips have gone up showing a bit more of the action. Despite what Clarke said about Riley's strength, there is a challenge here — the physical challenge of singing one of the two or three most demanding songs in the contest while walking at least 40 kilograms worth of outfit up a staircase. If he was emotionally drained after Australia Decides, Riley might be physically spent after three sets of rehearsals, last night's jury performance (which will determine the jury vote but won't be broadcast) and tomorrow's semi-final — and then if all goes well, a repeat of jury final, dress rehearsal and the grand final on Sunday morning our time. There is, of course, an elephant in the room in Turin — the presence of Ukraine and Kalush Orchestra with their entry, Stefania, which is the hot favourite to win for reasons including but not limited to the song and its performance. Eurovision is supposed to be non-political, all about the songs and the entertainment. But it's hard to avoid it in reality — when, for example, the Portuguese entry in 1974 was the signal for the beginning of a military coup. Even with previous Ukrainian entries — like Verka Serduchka's famous glam-stomp, Dancing Lasha Tumbai, which sounded suspiciously like ""Russia goodbye"" when sung; or 2016 winner 1944 by Jamala, a powerful vocal performance of a song about Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin's mass deportation in 1944 of the ethnic Tatar population from Crimea. The spotlight at this year's Eurovision Song Contest is firmly on Ukraine's entry, with Kalush Orchestra strong favourites as their country continues to fight an invasion from Russia, so that raises the question of who will host the contest in 2023 if they win. This year's song is a folk-rap number inspired by one of the band's grandmothers, but it will be performed as the eyes of the world and media are focused on their homeland, and its invasion by Russian forces. When Kalush Orchestra took to the stage for the first semi-final on Tuesday night local time, they received a standing ovation before and after their performance. Unsurprisingly, they qualified for the final. With half the scores for Sunday's final made up of the televote by the European — and Australian — public, it is not hard to imagine a big chunk of those votes being given to Ukraine as a show of support for the country and not just the song. And Sheldon Riley is OK with that — he would even welcome it. ""Eurovision completely saved my life, it was such a dark time for me, I think this contest brought me so much love and so much hope, I would love to see Ukraine win this competition, I think they deserve it, I think they need this hope,"" he told the gathered fan and legacy press in Turin. Although, he doesn't think the song is the best in the contest, stating his preference for Cornelia Jakobs's heartbreak hit Hold Me Closer for Sweden. Riley has been asked both before and after landing in Turin about the moment his emotions spilled over on stage at the Gold Coast for Australia Decides, and whether he thinks there could be a similar moment at the PalaOlimpico. ""The thing I think I really want to make clear to everybody is I am someone in Australia who has never been recognised or respected as a legitimate artist or a musician,"" he said. ""[But] in that moment I was performing to a room full of people that I didn't need to explain myself to, singing a song that I wrote very personally at 15 years old, in a very emotional sense of a competition I've wanted to do for years and years and years. ""At the actual Eurovision it will be emotionally driven, but I'm going to be really strong. I've realised that I've had my moment at Australia Decides that was so powerful for me, but this song isn't for me anymore, it's for other people as well. ""I'm excited to go out there and be strong for people who need to, or want to, hear my message."" Riley's big Eurovision adventure has taken him from reality TV to the ""Olympics of singing"". Regardless of the result, it's clear that it's lived up to his hopes. ""[What I'm hoping for], it's already happening, being able to speak about my music, about my fashion, about my art and have people see what I do,"" he said. And if he's the one who gets to stand on the stage and sing his song for a second time on Sunday morning Australian time, then everyone will get to see what he does.

3,Colin Firth stars in a straightforward retelling of a real military strategy involving a dead body,arts-culture,"  Operation Mincemeat stars Colin Firth in a straightforward retelling of a WWII strategy to trick Nazis with a decoy corpse For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency It might sound like the title for a gory, straight-to-video action movie, but Operation Mincemeat was a real World War II strategy – a secret Allied scheme to deceive the Nazis by dropping a corpse carrying fake military plans into enemy terrain, in the hopes that it might divert Hitler's forces from the real invasion planned for Sicily. Despite the absurdist potential of a story involving a reluctantly heroic stiff, this version of the event, from British filmmaker John Madden (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel; Shakespeare in Love), is an earnest and tastefully mounted dramatic thriller starring a cast of plummy thespians, including not one but two erstwhile Mr Darcys, in Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen (Pride and Prejudice). At this point, these movies are starting to feel suspiciously like parodies of cinema for an older audience. It's 1943 and – for those who haven't been paying attention for the last 75 years – the war is at a stalemate. Allied forces are plotting a crucial invasion of Sicily, but in order to divert attention from the operation and give their troops the best chance at success, they're determined to leak information to Nazi intelligence about a bogus campaign launching in Greece. The plan is the remit of the Twenty Committee, a secret cabal of British intelligence strategists dominated by the steely John Godfrey (Jason Isaacs), who run a hidden war in the shadows where – as the film's narrator hilariously informs us – ""the truth is protected by a bodyguard of lies"". The Committee's ranks include one Ian Fleming (Emma.'s Johnny Flynn, yet another Austen movie alumni), a young naval intelligence officer who refers to Godfrey as 'M' because he reminds him of his mother's authority. Among the other starchy, stiff-upper-lip caricatures, there's an officer named Bentley Purchase (Paul Ritter). Presumably, Basil Exposition is somewhere just out of frame. The corpse drop is the brainchild of Firth's intelligence officer Ewen Montagu, a middle-aged judge who family and friends believe to be serving as a naval commander. His plan has committee support in Macfadyen's agent Charles Cholmondeley, wily administrator Hester Leggett (Penelope Wilton), and ambitious secretary Jean Leslie (Kelly Macdonald), who agrees to pose as the dead man's sweetheart in exchange for a seat at the table. Together they set out to find a cadaver that might convincingly pass as a deceased Royal Air Force pilot. It's a plan that just might be crazy enough to work: the corpse will wash ashore in Spain carrying not-so-secret plans concerning an Allied attack on Greece, while a network of double agents will ensure the fake intel finds its way to Berlin. Not since Weekend at Bernie's has a stiff played such a pivotal role in the outcome of history. In Madden's version of the story, the committee selects the corpse of a vagrant (portrayed in flashback by Lorne MacFadyen) who drank himself to death on rat poison. There's debate about the real-life identity of the body the British used: some accounts suggest it was a deceased navy man, while Montagu himself said the corpse was ""a bit of a ne'er-do-well, and that the only worthwhile thing that he ever did, he did after his death"". Charming. Grisly as the scenario is, the film's most lively moments arrive via a brief passage of pitch-black humour, as photographers attempt to pose the dead body for an ID photo – with predictably unsuccessful results. Made up to look like a freshly drowned pilot, the newly monikered Acting Major William ""Bill"" Martin is packed on ice, bound for the Spanish coast. As Fleming would later put it: you only live twice. In order to tease this out to feature length, Madden and screenwriter Michelle Ashford (Masters of Sex), adapting the book by historian Ben Macintyre, fashion a tale of mild dramatic intrigue, with details of the characters' personal lives supplying emotional texture while the fate of the military operation hangs in the balance. (Seven-decade-old spoiler alert: it was a success.) There's some enjoyable attention to detail in the elaborate fabrication of the pilot's identity, with a running gag about the overripe dialogue in the soldier's fake letters that plays off the idea that everyone on the intelligence staff appears to be writing a spy novel. ""My God, who isn't writing a novel?"" says an exasperated Montagu, after yet another spook declares his intention to turn his exploits into fiction. And that's even before we get to Fleming, for whom the movie at times resembles an origin story: a visit to the intelligence department's 'Q' branch, for example, sees the future Bond scribe marvelling at a military issue wristwatch equipped with a miniature buzz-saw – catnip for 007 fans familiar with the author's war history. Operation Mincemeat is polite and polished stuff, content to stick to a predictable narrative and let history's stranger-than-fiction details supply the personality. Madden and cinematographer Sebastian Blenkov (Their Finest) shoot in anamorphic wide-screen for that old-school feel, delivering the kind of war movie your grandpa would love (that's a compliment, especially in an era where too many films resemble over-lit television shows). The film is stacked with fascinating details, but Madden can't always overcome the predictability of a narrative that might have come alive in the hands of a more daring filmmaker. A romantic triangle between Macfadyen, Firth and Macdonald, meanwhile, doesn't catch fire despite the actors' charms – and Firth, reliable as ever, and Macdonald, a long-underrated trouper, are both very good here. Given the premise, the movie could have been a little more strange, even funny: in one scene, a British officer mentions German General Jodl – pronounced ""yodel"" – and the moment practically begs for a cameo by Mel Brooks in full Sound of Music regalia. Comic treatment of the material isn't unprecedented either: back in the 50s, Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers and Harry Secombe's BBC radio troupe The Goon Show staged a parodic account of Operation Mincemeat in The Man Who Never Was, based on the book of the same name that also inspired the 1956 movie version (that film's deadpan line, ""Every body belongs to somebody,"" goes unmatched here). If Operation Mincemeat was already grist for the satirical mill in 1953, less than a decade after the war, it begs the reasonable question as to why this straightforward adaptation needs to exist at all, all these years later. The answer, of course, is obvious. Movies about quirky, feel-good episodes or stirring, patriotic victories in Britain's past are uncomplicated by the nation's more chequered 20th-century history, not to mention its Brexit-addled present; they're perfect for aging audiences who don't want to feel challenged or uncomfortable in the cinema. The fact that these audiences are now baby boomers looking back to their parents' stories of unambiguous heroism points to a curious retreat into familiarity. Maybe this is how nostalgia wins. Operation Mincemeat is in cinemas now. We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

4,"A woman shopping for a gun, a doctor doing the unthinkable: The thrillers broaching a dark topic",arts-culture,"  Debra Oswald, Jane Caro and Robert Lukins explore extreme responses to domestic abuse in new thrillers For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Jane Caro's new book begins with a woman shopping for a gun. In The Mother, Caro's first novel for adults, we meet 50-something-year-old Miriam Duffy, a successful real estate business owner and grandmother of two. Miriam, recently widowed, is not someone you'd expect to find contemplating a glass cabinet full of lethal weapons. At first, she tells the man behind the counter that she's ""just looking"", but the licence in her handbag reveals a different story — she's here to buy. This moment finds an echo in a handful of new novels in which women are faced with equally stark choices. In Debra Oswald's book, The Family Doctor, a woman stands staring at a syringe whose contents could kill the patient she is attending to. In Robert Lukins' Loveland, a woman watches a man pick up a knife, and knows how it will end. Compulsively readable yet unsettling, they raise a difficult question: what happens when the law fails to protect women from violent men? ""It's always interesting to see new trends emerge in writing, and these Australian authors certainly seem to have revenge on their minds right now,"" says Claire Nichols, host of ABC RN's The Book Show. ""These books forced me to consider what I would do in a hopeless situation. There's a vicarious thrill in seeing these women take matters into their own hands, but their actions obviously throw up a whole new set of ethical questions for the reader to consider."" When Caro decided to write The Mother, she turned to Annabelle Daniel, the CEO of Women's Community Shelters, for advice. Daniel sent her the transcript of the judgement of Simon Gittany, convicted for the horrific murder of his partner, Lisa Harnum, in 2013. Daniel had told Caro that this was the best summing up of coercive control she had ever read. ""The judge really talked about how the violence escalates, how the abuse escalated,"" Caro told The Book Show. ""It gave me a trajectory of how to do the drip, drip, drip, that builds the tension; that mounting fear that both Miriam and the reader, hopefully, feel."" In The Mother's opening pages, Miriam buys a Smith and Wesson nine-millimetre gun, and Caro spends the first half of her book showing us why. We are introduced to Miriam's youngest daughter, Ali, as ""the difficult one"". When Ali marries Nick, Miriam is initially relieved — her new son-in-law seems to dote on his wife. But then Ali begins to withdraw from her family and career, and Miriam, still grieving the loss of her husband Pete, can't quite put her finger on why. Caro drew on extensive research to paint a compelling and subtle portrait of coercive control as it develops. Nick doesn't turn violent right away, but the psychological and emotional manipulation he deploys is almost more terrifying because it causes Ali, and then Miriam, to doubt their own judgement. ""It's undetectable, hard to explain,"" says Caro. ""When you tell someone what happens, it either sounds ridiculous, like you must be exaggerating, or not bad enough to be a problem."" Caro wanted to convey how this can lead victims to remain silent. Especially if they discover their partner is surveilling them, and many do, it only ratchets up the fear and isolation. ""When it's most likely to escalate into violence is in fact when the women try to escape or make attempts to reinstate some sort of independence and freedom. That's when coercive control can become something deadly."" Without lived experience of such a situation, Caro was careful about whose perspective she presented. She wanted ""someone who was observing this happening, rather than someone to whom it was happening"". ""I wanted [Miriam], in a way, to represent us, because most of us, fortunately, we're not necessarily in a relationship like that, but we may watch it from outside, even if all we do is read the headlines … ""I wanted her feelings, terrors, dilemmas, struggles with both disbelief and belief, to mirror ours, so we could experience it vicariously through the novel and through her."" Debra Oswald too chose to centre the perspective of a bystander in The Family Doctor. Her opening pages could have come from a newspaper article, a scene in which a woman and her children have been murdered by her estranged partner. Stacey's body and those of her children are discovered by her oldest friend, Paula. They've been living with Paula for six months, hiding from Stacey's abusive ex, Matt. It is Paula, the family doctor of the title, who witnesses Matt kill himself after having murdered his family. Long after her home became a crime scene, Paula keeps circling that moment, wondering what signs she missed, and what she might have done to prevent the tragedy. ""It's a pang of responsibility that many of us feel about friends we know who've been in bad situations,"" says Oswald. ""Both Paula and Anita, her friend, feel this. They spend a lot of time after the deaths thinking, 'Should we have known? Should we have intervened?'"" When Paula encounters another woman who is clearly being abused by her partner, the question goes from hypothetical to practical. And in answering the question, Oswald manages to subvert notions of what a thriller can be. ""It's not a puzzle book. It's not a mystery to be solved,"" Oswald told The Book Show. Instead, her novel's relentless pace comes from the suspense of whether Paula and Anita will do the unthinkable, and how their own relationship will hold up under the strain of those choices. ""I kind of enjoyed the idea of the challenge – can I hold people with a forward momentum rather than a puzzle?"" ""They're just human beings with flaws and beauty inside them, who are stumbling around in the world, trying to do the right thing, and sometimes making a mess of it."" Robert Lukins wasn't thinking of plot points or big reveals when he started writing the manuscript that would become Loveland. In fact, it was never intended to be a novel — instead he described it as an ""elongated thought exercise"" and a ""solo counselling session"". ""I talked to my male friends, and everyone shakes their heads and talks about how terrible [toxic masculinity and gendered violence] is, but it's always something that is happening somewhere else; it's other men, it's imagined men, somewhere in society that we don't know anything about. It's never us, it's never our friends, it's never our family — but it is. This is us,"" says Lukins. The first version of Loveland was a story in which he interrogated his male characters. He wrote about their upbringing, the family relationships, the lives they lead, anything that could explain why they became violent and controlling. Then he got to the end and, unconvinced, started over again … and again. After six drafts, Lukins realised he couldn't make it work. ""I hit this brick wall because in the end with these men, I found plenty of reasons and plenty of excuses, but no justification obviously,"" Lukins told The Bookshelf. Having lived with these characters for so long, he started to reconsider his role as the author and whose voice and perspective he was privileging. When he chose to centre his story on grandmother and granddaughter May and Casey, he found a way to tell a story about how women live with — and survive — abusive men. ""It became a conscious, punitive act by me to push these men's experiences outside the sphere of the novel,"" says Lukins. ""The men in this story are present through their actions and present through their culpability. But ultimately, this is a novel of the experiences of these women and how they exist."" Kate Evans, co-host of The Bookshelf found herself thinking about how crime fiction can act as commentary on violence, justice and the law. ""It also has a reputation for providing resolution of some sort, if only narrative resolution,"" she says. ""But these novels are interesting in their discomfort: what does it mean to add vigilantism to the mix, especially if it seems justified? Where does it place us as readers, if we thrill to the idea of social-justice revenge? Are we then reading with one eye closed, squinting?"" In each of the novels, the women reach a point where there's seemingly nowhere left to run, and have to consider meeting violence with violence. As a doctor, Paula sees it as her job to ""protect the vulnerable little bodies of the children and women who come seeking her help"", says Oswald. Haunted still by the murder of her friend Stacey, Paula sees few other options. ""I hasten to add, I'm not advocating murder as a kind of transgressive daydream, that moment to channel our rage momentarily into 'What if we just killed one of these guys before he could hurt anybody?' Instead, I think it's about playing 'What if?' with that idea,"" she adds. ""That's what fiction can do, that non-fiction can't do … It's a way of saying, this is the level of desperation we are talking about, that under the right circumstances, a kind of perfect storm of trauma, a sequence of events might push a person who would normally never cross the line to cross the line."" For Lukins, it was never about writing revenge fiction. ""Revenge implies a choice. These are specific acts of survival. These characters have been placed in situations where all of their choices have been taken from them,"" he says. Connecting generations by structuring the novel around parallel timelines – May in the present and Casey in the 1950s – Lukins is also able to chart the cost of violence, which he describes as causing ""damage in all directions"". ""When the characters of my novel are forced to take action, it takes a huge toll on them, and it's one that they might never recover from."" Caro doesn't offer easy solutions — she says she has none. But that isn't why she wrote this book. ""I think that fiction takes the reader into compassion rather than judgement,"" she says. ""I really wanted us to stop having cliched judgements and views about women who find themselves in these terribly abusive relationships."" Caro is referring to questions she's heard when a domestic abuse news story breaks, questions like, ""Why didn't she just leave? Why did she keep the children from him? Why was she attracted to a man like that?"" ""I think novels take us out of our head and into our heart and our gut, so we don't judge Miriam and Alison, instead we feel [for them],"" says Caro. For Oswald, writing The Family Doctor was a way to transmute some of the deep anger she felt as she read story after story in the news about women and their children being assaulted. ""I wanted to wield that rage to other more positive, beautiful things, like the urge to protect people and the power of female friendship, and find a way to tell a story that would harness both those sorts of powerful forces."" Lukins, who set out to confront his own culpability, says writing the novel left him in no doubt that he — and everyone else — was complicit in gendered violence. He wants to see ""real-world change"" — significant legal reforms and improved financial support for survivors — and he's wary of anything less tangible. ""Maybe it's comforting in a way to read an article or a novel and then you feel like you've sort of reached a place of better understanding, but if nothing changes, then ultimately it's just an exercise in making ourselves feel better,"" he says. ""I suppose there's nothing wrong with starting a conversation, but if that conversation never goes anywhere, then I think it can do more harm than good.""

The 56-year-old is suing the ABC and Nine Entertainment Co over stories published in 2018 which alleged he assaulted female cast members during a 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. He is also suing actor Christie Whelan Browne, who played the female lead in the show, and was interviewed by the news outlets. McLachlan denies all claims of sexual harassment and bullying in the stories and says they ruined his reputation and put an end to his acting career. On Friday, the media outlets' barrister, Michael Hodge QC, tried to depict McLachlan as a man with a temper who would take his frustrations out on his co-stars. He asserted that during one show on May 9, 2014, McLachlan was so angry about a scene that had not gone as planned he yelled and swore at his colleagues backstage before kicking a rubbish bin. ""You said 'you're a bunch of untalented, ungrateful c***s',"" Mr Hodge told the court. ""No I did not,"" McLachlan said. The actor also rejected claims he forcefully grabbed Whelan Browne's face on stage later that night and said he only found out she made a bullying complaint when he read the news reports four years later. McLachlan also rejected ""storming off"" after musical supervisor Tony Castro gave him singing advice and telling his co-stars that ""[Mr Castro] wouldn't like the food at Sydney Hospital"". Throughout the trial, McLachlan has maintained he enjoyed jovial relationships with many of his female co-stars and ""theatrical"" yet platonic hugs and kisses were common. On Friday, he told the court it was possible he sat on the lap of actor Erika Heynatz and kissed her neck backstage one day, but strongly denied putting his crotch in her lap or ever entering her dressing room without consent. The long-time performer repeatedly claimed he and Whelan Browne were good friends throughout the show, but on Friday the court was shown an email which McLachlan sent to production director calling Whelan Browne ""Lucifer"". The email read: ""I was privately celebrating London's directive that the perpetually problematic Whelan Browne be sent packing."" ""Lucifer is being given another chance next week. Really???? OMG. ""The princess wins again … we all continue to march to the sound of her selfish, delusional, disrespectful and frankly nasty drum."" McLachlan said those were only his ""professional"" views of Whelan Browne and ""friends call each other all sorts of things"". Eleven women will give evidence during the trial alleging McLachlan behaved inappropriately during various theatre and TV productions and will detail allegations of groping and indecent exposure. One actor also in The Rocky Horror Show, Angela Scundi, accused McLachlan of an unwanted kiss on stage in which he used his tongue, but on Friday McLachlan told the court it was a ""peck"". The jury were shown raw footage from McLachlan's interview with Channel Seven program Spotlight last year which showed he and his partner re-enacting the scene to try and prove a ""pash"" wasn't possible given the musical timing. McLachlan was also seen telling the Channel Seven interviewer that he was the ""star of the f****n show"" and he would never put the scene at risk by lingering for a kiss. The trial continues.

11,"NSW Now: State government urges rail unions against strikes, as talks hit a snag",arts-culture,"  Sydney News: Rail unions and state government in gridlock over new train rollout timeline For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Here's what you need to know this morning. Talks aimed to stop industrial action have hit a snag after five weeks of enterprise agreement negotiations between rail unions and the NSW government. Minister for Employee Relations Damian Tudehope wants the New Intercity Fleet (NIF) $2 billion intercity trains to be rolled out immediately. ""I urge the unions to consider their position carefully and not to resort to extreme industrial action while the government's offer for rail workers is finalised,"" he said. ""Today I advised the leadership of the union movement that I will not support any Rail, Tram and Bus Union demands that further delay the rollout of the New Intercity Fleet."" But the Rail Tram and Bus Union's spokesman, Alex Claassens, said such a move would be unsafe. ""We want to fix these trains, we want to fix our enterprise agreement, we want to get on with our jobs operating the system for the people of NSW,"" he said. Actor Craig McLachlan will be further cross-examined today in his defamation trial. McLachlan is suing the ABC, Nine newspapers and actor Christie Whelan Browne for defamation over stories published in 2018. The articles contained allegations he indecently assaulted, harassed, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. Yesterday he was accused of repeatedly lying in his trial, after giving contradictory evidence about on-stage kissing during The Rocky Horror Show. The actor denied the accusation. Two days ago, McLachlan said he never kissed any of his female co-stars below the shoulders or arms during a bedroom scene in the show. But yesterday he admitted he once kissed Whelan Browne on the hip. He said the only reason he did so was because he dropped a fake cigarette used as a prop and had to improvise while trying to retrieve it from the bed. An investigation is underway into whether a shipment of drugs into regional New South Wales is linked to Indonesia's biggest seizure of cocaine. Fifty-four kilograms of cocaine, worth $20 million, was found near the body of a professional diver in the Port of Newcastle on Monday. Investigators believe the original shipment into Newcastle weighed 300 kilograms, with a street value of  $120 million. Only about 100 kilograms made its way into Australian waters and on Sunday, 179 kilograms of the drug was found near Merak Port on Java. A superyacht operator who lives in Cairns is set to be extradited to Sydney today to face charges of supplying and importing a commercial quantity of drugs. James Blee, 62, was arrested trying to board a flight to Singapore on Wednesday.

12,"Eight months after fleeing the Taliban, Afghan refugee Nazdana steps onto the runway at Australian Fashion Week ",arts-culture,"  Proud moment for fashion designer as Afghan refugee who fled the Taliban steps onto the runway at Australian Fashion Week For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Peeking out onto the runway from backstage at Australian Fashion Week, Australian-Afghan designer Mariam Seddiq could hardly believe what she was seeing. Modelling one of her looks under the glare of the lights was 24-year-old Nazdana Bakhtiari, who only eight months ago fled from Afghanistan with her mother, escaping the Taliban takeover. ""It was incredible. I was like, 'how is this happening?'"" the Western Sydney-born designer said. ""This time last year she was there (in Afghanistan). No way in hell would she have thought she'd be doing something like this. ""A woman can't even walk out of the front door at the moment."" The pair first met when Ms Seddiq was looking for women skilled in traditional Afghan beadwork, known as mora doozi, to use in her garments. A local contact from Fairfield in Sydney's west put her in touch with Ms Bakhtiari, her mother Zakia and a friend, who had only recently arrived in the country, after leaving Kabul airport on a military evacuation flight. ""I went to their apartment and I saw their work and I knew I had to include beadwork back into my designs, so they'd have work but in an arty way,"" she said. It was during their collaboration that the idea that Ms Bakhtiari might step out of the shadows to display her handiwork came about. ""When I dropped them home after work hand sewing, (Nazdana) mentioned she might want to model for me, so she's been practising for three weeks,"" Ms Seddiq said. ""It just seemed like a dream to take it one step further."" Ms Seddiq sees her designs, a mixture of couture gowns, suits, and jewellery as way to empower women. ""It's not just because of this Afghanistan thing. A lot of women forget how strong they are and what they're capable of. So that's really important to bring it out of all walks of life,"" she said. Her show at Australian Fashion Week in Sydney featured diverse models with a range of ages, sizes, genders and ethnic backgrounds. ""It just felt like more of a real show rather than a really curated show of skinny models,"" Ms Seddiq said. The former student of Bankstown Girls High School has gained a celebrity following, with her designs worn by Orange is the New Black actor Diane Guerrero, as well as Australian music stars Iggy Azalea and Delta Goodrem. Ms Seddiq said Australia had been slow to appreciate the work of its culturally diverse designers. ""I started in LA and was getting noticed in the US before I started getting any attention back home. ""It's about time Australia embraced its brown folk.

13,Keeping up with the Kardashians: Women turning to cosmetic surgery to be 'ethnic but not too ethnic',arts-culture,"  Why new cosmetic surgery trends that 'pick and choose' from cultures raise cultural appropriation concerns For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Who wins and who loses when beauty trends celebrate cosmetically altered looks that are ethnic — but 'not too ethnic'? Growing up in Sydney, Petronie was taught to be proud of her Blackness. The message was instilled in her by her mum and dad, who are from Zambia and the Republic of the Congo, respectively. ""They were always telling me that I'm Black and I'm beautiful, and just making sure I really believed that,"" Petronie says. Though it was powerful, it still couldn't shield the 26-year-old model and influencer from pervasive western beauty norms. In 2007, when US reality TV stars the Kardashians shot to fame, Petronie was one of the millions of people around the world who began noticing physical alterations in the sisters. In particular, she watched Kim Kardashian's ""nose changes over time"". And whenever Petronie used social media filters — which tweak facial features, often for comedic or beautifying effect — she noticed that some shrank the size of her nose. By the time she was 21, Petronie decided she wanted cosmetic surgery, too. ""I wanted my nose to be a bit thinner and pushed up,"" she says. But Petronie is acutely aware that while cosmetic surgery can erase some features like a non-Caucasian nose, it can also emphasise others, like big lips or almond-shaped eyes. That cosmetic procedures allow people to capitalise on the desirability of those cultural features — while removing others — is a pop culture paradox, and it's impacting the steadily growing number of Australians who are opting for cosmetic procedures. Many are weighing up the relationship between their culture and their appearance, in the face of trends that promote a look of ethnic — but, some argue, ""not too ethnic"" — ambiguity. Adria Goldman is assistant professor of communication and digital studies at the University of Mary Washington in the US. She says the term ""Blackfishing"" describes ""an act of cultural appropriation where someone non-Black tries to present themselves as Black"". That could be through darkening their skin, adopting an Afro-centric hairstyle, or getting a more voluptuous shape, through photo editing or even butt augmentation. ""Oftentimes [it's] for profit or some other personal gain,"" she says. Blackfishing is a criticism that's been levelled at the Kardashians, and other celebrities including Australian singer Iggy Azalea, British singer Rita Ora and American singer Ariana Grande. Some accused of Blackfishing or of cultural appropriation have counter argued that in fact they are enacting cultural ""appreciation"", Dr Goldman says. But, she argues, while intent is worth considering, ultimately it's not the point. ""A person can appropriate Black culture and say that their intention was not to do harm — but appropriating Black culture does do harm,"" she says. It can reinforce ""surface level"" or ""misinformed"" ideas about Black culture. ""It's commodifying this culture with no gain to Black people."" Like Petronie, social media consultant Natasha also watched the Kardashians' appearances morph over time. Natasha is Middle Eastern-Australian and was very insecure about her appearance when she was growing up. ""I never felt like I was the pretty girl, ever. And I think that was because … I was around mostly white people,"" she says. By the end of high school, she had endured years of teasing about her looks. Yet, at the same time, reality TV was demonstrating that appearance isn't fixed. ""I started realising, oh wow, things can be changed,"" Natasha says. So at 18 years of age, Natasha, who is now 26, began cosmetic enhancement — first lip filler, then rhinoplasty or a nose job — to alter what she calls her ""ethnic nose"". But she says that modifying her cultural features has come at a cost. While she publicly, and proudly, identifies as a woman of colour, she says she's been criticised online for having ""absolutely no features that correlate with a woman of colour"" and for being ""white passing"". For Natasha, such statements diminish her personal experience. ""They don't know the torment I went through growing up,"" she says. ""I start to think it's my fault because I've changed my ethnic features. ""But it's so wrong."" Natasha says the comments also diminish the discrimination faced by her Aramaean forebears. ""My people have gone through so much persecution … and even my parents, moving to Australia [have endured] so much hardship,"" she says. The criticism levelled at those who undergo cosmetic surgery to modify their cultural features is one that philosopher and physician Yves Saint James Aquino is familiar with. He has studied the ethics of cosmetic enhancement, specifically blepharoplasty or double eyelid surgery, a procedure that is most popular in South East Asia. Dr Aquino, who is also a research fellow with the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, says people who undergo this surgery are often criticised for ""betraying their heritage"" or being ""a race traitor"". He argues it's a reductive position to take. ""Heritage and culture is more than appearance,"" he says. Dr Aquino believes that people, women specifically, ""should be able to do whatever they want with their body"". But he also believes that ""choice"" to undergo body or face modification is a concept that ""we have to interrogate"" in the context of media, peer group and broader societal pressure. ""Even if no one's pointing a gun at your head, you live through all these pressures, all these directives … [so] is that an authentic choice?"" One of those pressures is social media. Dr Aquino knows of cosmetic surgeons who report that their clients want ""to change their face based on specific [social media] filters"". He says other clients want to alter their noses because the angle of a selfie gives the illusion of an increased nose size. ""So it's a very weird, perceptual thing that's influencing their self-image … it's the way they hold their phone,"" he says. The cosmetic enhancement industry in Australia is booming. We meet the people chasing their aesthetic ideal and those jumping off the cosmetic enhancement conveyor belt. Gemma Sharp has also noticed shifts in cosmetic surgery requests. A clinical psychologist and Senior Research Fellow in the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre, Dr Sharp leads the Body Image Research Group. She says there's been a move away from a ""traditional facelift, which is used to 'rectify' ageing processes"". Rather, ""preventative"" procedures such as fillers are becoming more common among younger people. Dr Sharp says the expansion of the sorts of people having procedures is thanks to reduced costs, increased availability and the normalisation of cosmetic surgery through the media. ""People who tended to seek cosmetic procedures were more likely aged 30 and over in the past, but now we are seeing people seeking them as young as late teens and 20s."" In the last five years or so, there's been a sharp increase in the use of injectables (such as in wrinkle-reducing or lip-filling procedures) in Australia, and the Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) operation, which ""is the fastest growing cosmetic surgery in the world"", Dr Sharp says. At 2018, Australians were spending more per capita on cosmetic surgery than in the US, with anti-wrinkle (Botox) injections the most popular operation at the time. Cosmetic surgery wasn't on the mind of 14-year-old Kina when she started posting selfies on social media. For a long time, Kina, who has Indian heritage, only posted photos with filters applied to them. At first, the filters were ""cute hearts"" or ""a nice background"", she says. ""And I was like, that's lovely."" Then she realised the filters could also ""slim down my nose … make my nose look upturned … make my lips and eyes bigger [and] my face slimmer"" and ""significantly lighten my skin"". ""I looked like a white person,"" Kina says. It began to change the way she thought about herself. ""I was just like, am I not pretty otherwise? It came to the point where I could not take a photo without a filter because I would look at myself and find all these little faults."" Kina started to ask herself, ""Why can't my nose be slimmer? Why can't my lips be bigger? Why can't my face have more of a structure to it instead of being so round?"" She recognised the filters' ""toxic"" influence and today she tries to avoid them. But she's concerned that she and her peers are bombarded on social media with ideals about an ""unattainable body"". ""[The beauty ideal] is very much centred around white women having racially ambiguous features, like those big lips, the very Middle Eastern and South Asian brows and eyes, and Black bodies,"" Kina says. ""It's just very unsustainable because nobody actually looks like that."" And it sends a powerful message of inadequacy to teenagers online. ""If I went and asked younger girls around my age, 'Do you have insecurities? Do you hate anything about yourself?', so many girls will be like, 'I hate my body, I hate my face [or] how my lips look or [how] my eyes look,'"" Kina says. ""If you ask them, 'Do you want to get surgeries when you're older?' so many girls will say, 'Yes, I can't wait.'"" Kina says race, and racism, is front and centre of the problem. ""People will go, 'Oh, this part of your ethnic features? Ugly. But this part? I want this part so bad … Your nose is flat, that's gross; but your eyes, they're so pretty.'"" What do people of colour, who've often been racially vilified for their appearance, have to say about others cherry-picking their features? Dr Aquino describes this as a ""mixed race"" western beauty trend that privileges ""racial ambiguity"". ""All of a sudden, you're beautiful because you look ethnic, but not too ethnic',"" he says. ""There is a certain range where we find things to be acceptable."" Dr Goldman says there's a powerful marketing opportunity within that range. ""One of the things about the Kardashians and about racial ambiguity in general is that individuals have the ability to sit in the middle of this white and non-white [identity], reaping the benefits, while avoiding the costs."" Petronie has noticed an increase online in the presence of big hips, big lips and big bums in young women, including among white women. For her, it demonstrates an inescapable hypocrisy. ""I find it interesting because [white people] were teasing us before because Black people had big lips. ""And now that's what you want. ""When you're not Black and those are Black features — the lips and even the hair, like braids — it's cultural appropriation,"" she says. Petronie argues the act of assuming physical features or styles that are typical of a culture other than your own — full lips or full hips, or cornrows, for example — brings with it some responsibility. If you emulate Black culture, she says, ""then I want you to keep that same energy when it comes to issues that are happening within the Black community"". Stand with the Black Lives Matter movement, for example. ""Make sure that you're an ally. Don't just pick and choose what parts of our culture suit you, because Black culture is not a trend,"" Petronie says. Rokeshia Ashley, an assistant professor at Florida International University who specialises in body image and modification, wants to move on from talking about the Kardashians. She says plenty of Black women are now ""taking hold of this conversation"" and are ""also using their bodies as social capital"". She points to public figures such as model Blac Chyna, entrepreneur Jai Nice or influencer Eliza Reign as examples. Whether through modelling clothes or paid social media sponsorships, the women are creating revenue ""how they see fit"", she says. ""Although it may seem morally compromising to some, they are well within their right to govern their bodies autonomously."" Dr Ashley says rather than consider body modification — a term she uses to include cosmetic surgery as well as changes to hair or make-up — as inherently bad, we should be more ""receptive and supportive to what Black women want to do with their bodies"". Black women's bodies ""have always been governed"", whether by slavery or health institutions, or through other means, Dr Ashley says. ""Globally, with anti-Blackness, we didn't have the opportunity to be able to say, 'This is what I want to do with my body.'"" Whatever that choice is today, she supports it, so long as it can be done safely and with all the education and information at hand. Unlike some of her online critics, Natasha doesn't conflate her cosmetic procedures with her relationship to her cultural background. ""I'm very, very proud of being Middle Eastern,"" she says. And she's happy today with her slimmer nose and other cosmetic modifications, which she says have ""definitely made me more confident"". Petronie, on the other hand, decided against cosmetic surgery, and is also content with her decision. Her nose job idea was discouraged by her partner and, after considering it for a while, Petronie agreed she didn't need it. ""[I thought], you know what, I'm just going to embrace my culture [and] embrace my nose,"" she says. ""This is a Black person's nose. This is not every Black person's … but it's who I am. It's part of my history, my background. So I think I will be keeping it.""

14,"'Irreplaceable': Globally-renowned master of the yidaki, Mr Gurruwiwi, dies in Arnhem Land",arts-culture,"  Mr Gurruwiwi, globally-renowned master of the yidaki, dies in Arnhem Land For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Mr Gurruwiwi, a renowned and celebrated master of the yidaki, more commonly known as the didgeridoo, has died in Arnhem Land after a long battle with illness. He has long been considered the world’s foremost master of the yidaki, an instrument developed by the Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land, and a symbol of Aboriginal Australia. WARNING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised this article contains an image of a person who has died. Mr Gurruwiwi's family have given permission for his last name and image to be used. Mr Gurruwiwi's exact age at the time of his death was unknown, however it is believed he was in his late eighties. Zelda Gurruwiwi, Mr Gurruwiwi's daughter, said her family and the Galpu people were ""feeling sad and feeling proud"". ""He flew with the yidaki, he was travelling with the yidaki,"" she said. ""He shared that from his own heart to the world."" Ms Gurruwiwi said her father left a powerful legacy. ""We're proud of him. Outside, physical, we're sad. Inside, spiritually, bright,"" she said. ""Sharing culture, he was holding that culture, living with that culture and he was walking with it. ""It's all there, that life. You know what he said last minute to me? He said: 'My work is done.' ""He shared the love, kindness, happiness, laughter, joy, because he was living in a world that he came from."" A leader of the Dhuwa moiety Galpu clan of north-east Arnhem Land, Mr Gurruwiwi lived in Birritjimi on the Gove Peninsula, about 1,000 kilometres east of Darwin. There, in north-east Arnhem Land, Mr Gurruwiwi's father Monyu gave him the specific role as the primary custodian of the yidaki for his clan. Outside of his home, he took the yidaki, an instrument he called his ""whole life"", to the world. The sound of his yidakis has been described as being imbued with the power of lightning and thunder, and he became popularly known as a master of the instrument — a status burnished when Mr Gurruwiwi was chosen to make the yidakis for Yothu Yindi. His instruments toured with the band and have been heard in studio recordings played on mainstream radio all over the world. Mr Gurruwiwi was also known as a healer and a teacher, and those who came across him would often remark on his grand wisdom and wit, warmth and charisma, and larger than life presence. Describing him as ""irreplaceable"", Will Stubbs, the coordinator of the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre in north-east Arnhem Land, said Mr Gurruwiwi was a vital holder of knowledge. ""Mr Gurruwiwi was a true one-of-a-kind legend. He had international cult status within the world of didgeridoo players,"" he said. ""The yidaki or didgeridoo originates from here and the Galpu clan have primary responsibility for the songlines that detail that origin. As leader of that clan he vigorously promoted and defended that legacy. ""There are literally thousands of people from many overseas nations who have been welcomed into his modest family home to learn the intricacies of the instrument over the last 35 years. ""He is truly irreplaceable."" Until his death, Mr Gurruwiwi lived in dilapidated housing at Birritjimi, where homes were built in the 1970s to house the managers of a Rio Tinto mining operation. In 2020, he said his family's pleas for safer housing had gone unheard for years: ""We want people to start recognising us, hear our voices,"" he said. The year before, the Royal Australian Mint adopted a design by Mr Gurruwiwi for a $1 coin. Mr Gurruwiwi was the key consultant of the 'Yidaki: Didjeridu and the Sound of Australia' exhibition by the South Australian Museum, one of the most comprehensive projects to ever chronicle the instrument. The exhibition examined the instrument as both iconic yet, inexplicably, underappreciated by wider Australia. The South Australian Museum's head of humanities John Carty has said First Nations Australians steered the museum to Mr Gurruwiwi to advise on the exhibition. ""The only way that [the museum] could do this with any integrity was to work with the real experts, [Mr Gurruwiwi, his family]' and the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land],"" Mr Carty said in 2017. He said Mr Gurruwiwi changed the way the world saw his instrument and taught the nation more about the power and knowledge of his Yolngu people. ""[Mr Gurruwiwi] has been one of the men who has been really integral in the spread of the instrument, not only in Australia, but overseas,"" he said. ""He's more famous in Japan and Germany and overseas than he is in Australia, because he's spent his life taking the instrument ... around the world to share that knowledge and to use the instrument as a bridge between cultures."" Film-maker Ben Strunin, who made a biopic of Mr Gurruwiwi and toured with him through Europe, told The Guardian in 2017 that Mr Gurruwiwi ""deserves all the recognition of our most celebrated music stars"". The film made showcase of the yidaki master's friendship and work with Grammy award-winning musician Gotye, whose real name is Wally De Backer. Mr De Backer has paid tribute to the late clan elder, describing him to ABC Radio Darwin as ""a human of incredible spirit"". ""I feel fortunate to have spent some time with him and his family,"" he said. ""His deep commitment to music, healing and family will continue to be a source of inspiration to me, and I hope it may also be to others who look into his life and work."" Zelda Gurruwiwi said the yidaki was ""mystery, history"" to her father. ""It came itself, this nature, the instrument, and now we're living with that nature,"" she said. ""You can see trees coming, you can feel the breeze coming from north, east, west, south. ""That instrument took him far.""

16,"'The love, the hurt': What Johnny Cash sang about 'belongs to everyone'",arts-culture,"  Johnny Cash's life celebrated in Devonport premiere of musical Ring of Fire For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency ""Hello … I'm not Johnny Cash"" drawls local theatre legend Sid Sidebottom as Wendy (from costume) passes him another black shirt in the backstage hallway. In a full dress rehearsal for Ring of Fire, The Music of Johnny Cash, the former federal member for Braddon demonstrates that he can deliver the deep and low tones of the legendary American singer. But this is not a tribute show. It's a journey through Cash's life and a genderless celebration of universally loved songs, hence the play on Cash's famous opening line. ""I'm not him. No-one is playing Johnny Cash, yet we all are,"" Mr Sidebottom says, reaching for what must be the last long, black trenchcoat available in Devonport. ""In this show, there are a number of classic Johnny Cash songs sung by females. I think people will be really excited by that and you do still feel that Johnny Cash is there. ""What Johnny Cash sang about, the love, the hurt, the causes — those things belong to everyone."" The cast of six singers are joined by a seven piece on-stage band — the Smokin' Locals —  led by co-director David Turner. The singers joining Mr Sidebottom are Annette Dawes, Zac Weeks, Laura Auton, Sherry Rand and Andrew Grey. Last year Mr Sidebottom directed the Devonport Choral Society's Buddy Holly story at the same venue: Devonport's Town Hall Theatre. That show was very much led by a star turn by young singer, guitarist and actor, Ezra Shelverton. For his energetic Buddy Holly, he won the Tasmanian Theatre Award prize for Outstanding Male Lead Performance. This year it's the newly formed Cradle Coast Theatre that is staging Ring of Fire. And the experience has been a baptism of fire. They chose a show that was flexible enough to get through a COVID period. ""We've been severely affected by the pandemic. We've had to postpone the show and a majority of this cast and the band have had COVID,"" Mr Sidebottom says. ""So, it's been a long journey. A bit like Johnny Cash's story I think."" Mr Sidebottom says there's a lot of darkness in Johnny Cash's music. ""Here's a man who had great faith but also sinned greatly. He hurt a lot of people, was hurt by a lot of people,"" he says. ""I think he was always seeking redemption."" Over where the band is warming up, drummer Pete Jermy points to the official musical notation on the stand that directs his drums on the classic song Jackson. It reads: ""s**t kickin"". ""It's an apt description of the relentless, big rhythm that's in so much of this music,"" the drummer says. The singers revel in it too, belting out 30 Cash greats across the two acts of the show, often in duet and with stunning six-part harmonies on the gospel numbers. Annette Dawes has been travelling 90 minutes each way from Irish Town — after work — for each rehearsal and will do it again for each of the 10 shows between May 13 and May 28. ""I've come to appreciate Johnny Cash even more through this experience,"" Ms Dawes says. ""I love the group songs, Five Foot High and Rising, Daddy Sang Bass. They're just a heap of fun."" Co-star Laura Orton concurs: ""I love Daddy Sang Bass, especially the a capella part at the start."" ""We're all facing each other and you can just feel the music. It's really beautiful."" The show is backed by a projection of archival images from Cash's earliest days as a poor kid on an Arkansas cotton farm through his early marriage to Vivian Liberto and on to the evolution of his great love with June Carter. The power of the show is in the greatness of the songs and in the fine cast of local singers who can all ""wear black"" with aplomb when called upon. Sherry Rand, Zac Weeks and Andrew Grey are all known for regular professional gigging along the coast and know how to own the stage. The premiere performance is at the Devonport Town Hall Theatre on Friday night.

17,Craig McLachlan accused of lying while giving evidence in defamation trial ,arts-culture,"  Craig McLachlan accused of lying while giving evidence in defamation trial For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Actor Craig McLachlan has been accused of repeatedly lying in his defamation trial, after giving contradictory evidence about on-stage kissing during a production of The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan is suing the ABC and Nine Newspapers for defamation over stories from 2018 containing allegations he indecently assaulted, harassed, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 Australian tour of The Rocky Horror Show. He is also suing actor Christie Whelan Browne, who made the allegations to the ABC's 7.30 program and the Sydney Morning Herald. Two days ago, McLachlan said he never kissed any of his female co-stars below the shoulders or arms during a bedroom scene in the show, but on Thursday admitted he once kissed Whelan Browne on the hip. He said the only reason he did so was because he dropped a fake cigarette used as a prop and had to improvise while trying to retrieve it from the bed. ""Because I dropped the e-cigarette and Christie saw it as well, so I jokingly kissed her on the hip while I scrambled to find the e-cigarette. It was quite a funny moment,"" he told the court. But the barrister representing the media outlets, Michael Hodge QC, argued McLachlan inappropriately touched and kissed not only Whelan Browne under the bed covers, but two other actors who were understudies during the tour. This is something McLachlan said was ""impossible"" as there wasn't enough time during the scene and he was too focused on putting the e-cigarette in a specially designed pocket under the covers. He also claimed some of the kissing sounds picked up by his microphone while under the covers were what he called ""air kisses"" and not actually on his co-star's body. ""You're making this up aren't you?"" Mr Hodge said. ""No I'm not Mr Hodge,"" McLachlan said. ""That's just a lie … a deliberate lie,"" Mr Hodge said. ""No it's not,"" McLachlan said. Later during cross-examination, the actor contradicted evidence he gave earlier this week in court about a conversation with a co-star in April 2014. On Tuesday, he denied telling the actor, who cannot be identified, that he ""couldn't wait for the bedroom scene"" while in her dressing room one night. But on Thursday, Mr Hodge showed McLachlan a 2018 affidavit he signed which stated he did say this. McLachlan then claimed he could recall mentioning the bed scene to the actor but that it was only in reference to ""corpsing"" — something which he described as actors intentionally trying to make each other laugh while on stage. ""We would routinely talk about making each other laugh or not laugh in the bed scene,"" McLachlan said. Mr Hodge then said McLachlan was just trying to ""spin"" evidence that didn't support his earlier claims. ""No I haven't,"" he said. The defamation trial is expected to run for around five weeks and will hear from 11 women who have accused McLachlan of inappropriate behaviour. All worked with him on Australian TV or theatre productions. McLachlan says the media reporting of such allegations damaged his reputation and caused him so much distress he had to be admitted into a mental health facility in 2018.

18,Designers bring lived experience to disability-friendly creations for Australian Fashion Week,arts-culture,"  Designers Carol Taylor and Jessie Sadler bring disability-friendly creations to runway for Australian Fashion Week For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency For the first time in Australian Fashion Week history, a runway show has been created by and for people with disabilities, and modelled by people with disabilities. Award-winning Gold Coast artist Carol Taylor was one of two women who co-designed several ""adaptive clothing"" pieces for Fashion Week in Sydney, which were being showcased today. She and co-partner Jessie Sadler created the pieces for Brisbane-based label Christina Stephens, and the range includes clothing for people living with disabilities, spectrum disorders and who have difficulty dressing themselves. The pair said they hoped to make ""adaptive clothing"" mainstream and wanted to see the pieces displayed in major department stores. Former Sydney-based lawyer Carol Taylor was in a horrific car crash in the Blue Mountains in 2001 that severed her spinal cord and left her a quadriplegic. She said she had always been interested in fashion but after her injury, that passion turned to devastation when she could never find any clothing to suit her altered body. She decided to begin designing clothing for herself, which morphed into creating clothing for people with all kinds of disabilities and disorders. ""There are so many different considerations that adaptive clothing brings, there are so many misconceptions about designing in this space,"" she said. ""So if I'm designing for someone in a wheelchair, it's not just about designing for someone in the seated position, careful consideration has to be given to things like movement and dexterity issues. ""Temperature control, because the thermostat in the brain doesn't work the same anymore after spinal cord injury. ""Things like life-threatening pressure sores, it's also important to consider fabric type for those who suffer from arthritis or spectrum disorders because they can experience sensory issues, the list goes on."" Ms Taylor joined forces with brand founder Jessie Sadler, and together they have worked to create disability-friendly designs that can also be worn by able-bodied people. Together the pair were asked to create a number of pieces to open Australian Fashion Week on Thursday. ""It's more than just magnets and Velcro, and by showcasing at Australian Fashion Week, I believe we begin the journey of taking adapted fashion mainstream,"" Ms Taylor said. ""We want to show our designs that are thought provoking, provocative, luxurious, exciting, colourful. ""People with disabilities want to be included in the fashion conversation and have the same access to fun, colour and excitement as everybody else"" Ms Taylor said the runway collection showcased pieces close to her heart, including one item ""specifically designed for the girl that cannot stand"". ""But every other item has in-built features that are going to benefit someone with mobility, dexterity, disability issues, but could equally be worn by someone who is able-bodied."" She said another piece was prompted by wanting to give people with disabilities the same intimate moments as able-bodied people. ""Inspiration for this design came about when i was in an online conference and there was a young quadriplegic man that was to get married and his girlfriend was able bodied,"" she said. ""The boys at the end of the conference were having a bit of a laugh and joke about the wedding night coming up, and you could hear a pin drop. ""He said yeah you should know that I will never know what it's like to unwrap my bride, and for me that was a light-bulb moment. ""I thought oh my gosh, why should he be denied this intimacy, and I thought well that problem needs solving."" Ms Taylor said the clothing's point of difference was the designers having lived experience with disability themselves, with Carol a quadriplegic and Jessie's mother suffering an arm injury that led to her getting arthritis and having difficulty getting dressed. ""We are the only clothing label that has lived experience of disability at the design table,"" she said. ""There's absolutely no substitute, at the moment we have able-bodied people designing for people with disabilities. ""So this is the first time customers are going to have people with disabilities designing for people with disabilities and I think that's a critical point of difference.""

20,Bear essential: Treasured teddy rescued from outback after dad's travel photo blunder,arts-culture,"  Lost teddy bear 'Pooh' reunited with family after being lost in the outback For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A long-lost teddy has finally been reunited with his family months after being left behind in outback NSW. Gordon Wilson left his son's treasured bear 'Pooh' on a fence post along the Barrier Highway near Broken Hill in March while part way through a 5000km journey from Bowen in north Queensland to Perth in WA. Mr Wilson had been taking photos with the bear as a way of keeping himself and the family entertained. After being ""distracted by flies"" and driving off – it took hours for Mr Wilson to realise he'd left his son's prized possession more than 150km away. He decided against going back, and that's where the real adventure began. He and his wife Lois Wilson logged onto to social media and began posting on Broken Hill Facebook groups, asking if someone had seen or picked up the bear. What happened next came as a shock to the Wilsons. Their appeals for help were shared all over the internet. ""I was actually quite amazed by the reaction and how many people were following the story,"" Mr Wilson said. Grazier Mitch Rodgers was one of those interested onlookers. Determined to reunite the family with their beloved bear, he drove out from Comarto Station near Wilcannia to find Pooh where he had been left. While the plan had initially been to post him back in the mail, Mr Rodgers and Mr Wilson thought the adventure should continue. So they decided to harness the power of social media to find more people willing to travel with the bear across to the west coast. ""Mitch went to great trouble and started to share the story on social media with some great photos,"" Mr Wilson said. ""The story then took on a life of it's own and if it wasn't for Mitch it probably wouldn't have got off the ground like it did."" He said Pooh's journey garnered interested from as far afield as Scotland, where he had relatives. He said Pooh travelled 150km to Broken Hill and visited Silverton before heading south to Mildura in Victoria. ""He then received a lift from a couple to Adelaide and from there flew to Perth,"" he said. ""I'll tell you what it took off pretty quick,"" Mr Rodgers said. ""It was just good to hear that people were getting a bit of joy out of it."" 24-year-old Ben Wilson, who's had the bear since he was a baby, is still stunned that so many people dedicated their time and effort to make sure the teddy was returned. ""I thought that was it, and I was never going to get him back,"" he said. ""I'm grateful for Mitch, the Broken Hill community along with anyone and everyone who was involved,"" Ben said. Asked if Pooh would be having any more adventures anytime soon….the answer was ""unlikely"". ""He'll be staying with me until I have my first child and then when he or she gets old enough, I'll tell them the story of what happened here,"" Ben said. ""Because it's not something we're going to forget anytime soon.""

21,Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love?,arts-culture,"  Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The ""36 questions of love"" have taken the dating world by storm. First published in 1997 as part of scientific research into relationships, the 36 questions of love gained global popularity through Mandy Len Catron's viral 2015 New York Times essay ""To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This"". In that essay, she outlines how she used the 36 questions with a university acquaintance on a casual night out. The result was the two fell in love, not dissimilar to two research participants who took part in the study back in 1997. In the publishing of that essay, a phenomenon was born. Social media, dating websites, dating coaches and bloggers were posting, writing or discussing the 36 questions of love — often framing these questions as a surefire method to find love — backed by science. As people attempted the 36 questions of love during dates, it became clear the 36 questions typically did not result in people falling in love. The 36 questions are three sets of 12 questions. Each set is designed to increase the amount of information a person discloses about themselves to a stranger. Not only does each set of questions increase the amount each person must disclose, but within each set, the questions increase the level of disclosure as they progress. For example, one question in the first set includes ""For what in your life do you feel most grateful?"" The second set includes questions such as ""What is your most treasured memory?"" The final set, which requires the greatest disclosure, includes questions such as ""When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?"". To answer this, one needs to go back to the original paper published by well-known relationships researcher Arthur Aron and colleagues. The research aim was to determine if progressively increasing disclosure increases closeness between two strangers. The research was not designed to test whether the questions lead to love. Instead of upskilling women to cope with the harm they risk in dating men, the self-help industry should focus on male behaviour. Across three studies, Aron and colleagues found support for the idea that a gradual increase in disclosure between strangers is related to an increase in closeness immediately after the experiment. The original research never measured whether people developed feelings of love directly after the experiment or in the future. However, the final study did a brief follow-up with most matched pairs of participants. Seven weeks after participating in the study, it was found 57 per cent of the matched pairs had a follow-up conversation, 35 per cent did something together (no more details were provided), and 37 per cent went on to sit together in class. But again, none of these findings have anything to do with people finding love and going on to have a long-term relationship. If indeed the 36 questions helped Mandy Len Canton find love, that is a positive thing. However, for the dating world to generalise about the love-generating properties of the 36 questions on the basis of one popularised case speaks to how pop culture can heavily misconstrue science. Those of us who study how people fall in love and what makes for a lasting relationship know there are many ingredients that go into making a relationship work. Some of these include: the importance people place on what they want in the ideal partner people's similarities and differences people's history of past relationships styles of dealing with conflict ability to support and respond to a partner in stressful times the alignment of partners' beliefs, values and goals each person's level of commitment and the ability to regulate emotions (and these are just some of the factors). The point of the research conducted by Aron and his colleagues is self-disclosure and enhancing closeness are two factors that matter within the larger scheme of factors. The other important point is the 36 questions provide a structured way to engage in self-disclosure. Research has shown relationships can falter when people disclose too much about themselves early on in the dating process. When people do not know each other well, it can be overwhelming for a person to hear very intimate and personal details about another. They may not know how to respond to the disclosure, or feel uncomfortable themselves. This can result in the person who disclosed coming away from the interaction feeling invalidated and vulnerable. On the other hand, when a person feels their partner responds to their disclosures and vulnerabilities, relationship intimacy is enhanced. But it is a high bar to set early in a relationship to expect a partner to respond appropriately to another who discloses highly personal information about oneself. Generally speaking, over-disclosure in the early stages of relationships can be problematic, especially for those who are anxious about their relationships. So taking a gradual and measured approach to self-disclosure and ensuring each partner has the opportunity to disclose at a comfortable pace is very important. The 36 questions are unlikely to be a ""surefire"" way to find love, but they can help people understand the importance of taking a gradual approach to self-disclosure. Finding love doesn't have to be a race. Gery Karantzas is an associate professor in social psychology / relationship science at Deakin University. This piece first appeared on The Conversation.

22,Craig McLachlan admits in court kissing actor who later accused him of sexual harassment,arts-culture,"  Craig McLachlan admits in court kissing actor who later accused him of sexual harassment For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Actor Craig McLachlan has told a Sydney court that while backstage during a 2014 theatre production he kissed an actor who has since accused him of sexual harassment. McLachlan made the admission during cross-examination in his defamation trial against the ABC and Fairfax Media over stories published in 2018. The stories contained allegations he indecently assaulted, bullied and exposed himself to female cast members during the 2014 tour of The Rocky Horror Show. McLachlan is also suing actor Christie Whelan Browne who made the allegations to the ABC's 7.30 program and the Sydney Morning Herald, which is now owned by Nine Entertainment Co. He has so far denied all allegations in court but on Wednesday under questioning by the media organisation's barrister, Michael Hodge QC, he accepted he did kiss actor Erika Heynatz in her dressing room before a show in Melbourne. He said he had been in his own dressing room with his long-time partner Vanessa Scammell before he told her he was going to ""check up on Erika"". He said he knocked on Heynatz's door, she told him to come in and he then told her to ""look at me"". ""She did and I kissed her."" ""I said words to the effect of 'I can't stop thinking about you' .... I spun back on my heel... and said 'I think I might be falling love with you'."" Earlier on Wednesday McLachlan broke down on the stand and revealed he was admitted to a mental health facility after the stories were published. McLachlan, who has enjoyed a long and successful acting career in Australia, told the court the reports damaged his reputation and caused him so much social anxiety he feared ever leaving his house. He said for a long time his only social activity was shopping for his elderly mother while wearing a disguise. ""You are fearful to ever step outside … you feel absolutely powerless against it,"" he said. ""I have been to a restaurant once in four and a half years."" He said on one occasion when he was wearing a disguise while shopping in Coles his hat fell off and a nearby customer recoiled in fear when she identified him. ""[The] woman grabbed her children and reigned them in … looking at me in disgust, it was very, very difficult to reconcile,"" the 56-year-old said. McLachlan gave evidence that immediately after the stories were aired on January 8, 2018 his cousin came and stayed with him as he was worried he would ""do something stupid"" and by the end of the year the actor had to be admitted into a mental health facility. He also explained it was too upsetting to read and watch the stories when they went live and Ms Scammell had to read them to him days later. The Sydney Morning Herald put McLachlan on the front cover of their January 8 edition and a double-page spread led with the headline: ""Manipulative, a predator: McLachlan stands accused"", the court heard. ""When the news broke … and it was revealed to me that these allegations had been made by my friends, it was just too difficult quite frankly to read the article on the day,"" he said. ""The realisation that my friends who 'goosed me', poked me, laughed with me and sat on my lap for almost eight months, [who] stuck their fingers up my nose, shared their lives with me, were making these allegations …"" McLachlan said before breaking down. On Tuesday the former Neighbours star told the jury the cast of the Rocky Horror Show often played gags or ""schticks"" on each other and said Whelan Browne often 'goosed' people – which he described as someone using their fingers to poke someone else between the buttocks. The trial is expected to hear from 11 women who worked with McLachlan on the Rocky Horror Show and TV shows including The Doctor Blake Mysteries about inappropriate touching or comments by the actor. On Wednesday morning his lawyer Kieran Smark SC outlined the dozens of allegations made by the women, all of which McLachlan emphatically denied. Some accusations include that he touched the genitals of Whelan Browne during a bedroom scene in the Rocky Horror Show, he exposed himself to many of the cast members and he threatened to ""end"" one actor who complained about him kissing her without consent.

23,Eurovision 2022 has kicked off. Here's who is competing and how to watch in Australia,arts-culture,"  Eurovision 2022 has kicked off with Ukraine tipped to win. Here's who is competing and how to watch in Australia For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Eurovision Song Contest semi-finals kicked off early on Wednesday morning, and there's still an entire weekend filled with musical extravaganza ahead of us. With last year's event attracting the eyeballs of 183 million viewers, the world's largest live music event is set to make some big waves this year. To help you brush up on the facts: here's everything you need to know about Eurovision 2022. SBS will broadcast Eurovision. The network will exclusively cover the events on SBS and SBS On Demand from May 11 to 15. Prime-time broadcasts will air on Friday May 13 and Saturday May 14 at 8:30pm, and Sunday May 15 at 7:30pm. The ABC will be live blogging the grand final on Sunday from 4:30am AEST. Sheldon Riley will fly the flag for Australia this year. The 23-year-old, who grew up on the Gold Coast, sealed his spot on the plane to Turin with his ballad Not the Same. Riley has developed a large following through performances on The Voice in 2018 and 2019 and America's Got Talent in 2020. To qualify for the Eurovision song competition, you have to be part of the EBU. SBS is part of the EBU and has been broadcasting the show since 1983. Australia made its Eurovision debut in 2015 when, as part of celebrations for the contest's 60th anniversary, it was invited to enter the competition. For now, the country has secured a Eurovision spot until 2023. The country with the most votes wins the competition and gets to host it the next year. Because of the time difference, if Australia wins, then it must nominate a European co-host which will stage the competition on its behalf. Last year, Italian rock group Måneskin was crowned the Eurovision winner in Rotterdam with their song Zitti E Buoni, which in English translates to Shut Up and Behave. The Italian band won the Eurovision Song Contest with 524 points, 25 points ahead of runners-up from France. Australia's Montaigne finished 14th in last year's semi-final. For obvious reasons the EBU in February announced that no Russian act would participate in this year's contest. Ukraine's act, folk rap group Kalush Orchestra, is overwhelmingly tipped to win, rising to the top of the winning odds following Russia's invasion earlier this year. The six members of the musical act have received special permission to leave Ukraine during the conflict in their country. Most Ukrainian men of military age are currently required to stay in order to help defend their nation. Kalush Orchestra's song, Stefania, will be sung in Ukrainian. The translated lyrics include the line: ""I'll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed."" Ukraine is the favourite to win this year's contest but Italy, the United Kingdom and Sweden are in second, third and fourth place, respectively. It's a glitzy, sometimes eccentric, often weird and wonderful song competition organised annually by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Keep up with all the latest news from the Eurovision Song Contest, including: The participants are predominantly European, but this year, 40 countries across the globe have entered the international song contest. Eurovision has public broadcasters from each country send a representative to perform an original song to compete for the coveted title of Eurovision champion. It kicked off in 1956 as the brainchild of Marcel Bezençon of the EBU, in part as an attempt to unite Europeans following World War II, and it was also designed to test the limits of live television broadcast technology. In 2020, the competition was cancelled for the first time in its more-than-60-year history due to the pandemic. However, it's been recognised by Guinness World Records as one of the longest-running annual TV music competitions in the world. And this year the Italian city of Turin is hosting. Pop group ABBA claimed victory for Sweden in 1974. Celine Dion claimed the title for Switzerland in 1988. Yes, she's from Canada and, no, singers don't have to be from the country they're representing. Yeah, it doesn't really make sense. But just go with it. Famous Australian Olivia Newton-John was chosen as the United Kingdom’s singer in 1974, finishing in fourth place. Ireland takes the Eurovision crown, with seven wins. Coming in second, is Sweden which has won Eurovision six times, while the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, France, and the Netherlands have won five times. ABBA's legendary hit Waterloo. The 1974 global hit, which rocketed the band to stardom, was recently named the greatest Eurovision song of all time by BBC viewers.

24,"There used to be hundreds of 'uniquely Australian' B&S balls across the country, but they're vanishing. Here's why",arts-culture,"  B&S balls in decline as liquor licensing and safety regulations increase costs for organisers For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Ask anyone who has ever been to a Bachelors and Spinsters Ball (B&S) and a few images that may come to mind include getting dressed up, getting drunk, dancing, getting dirty and maybe waking up in an unusual situation. Records show that B&S balls were being organised as far back as 1861. The original B&S balls were organised for men and women who worked and lived on remote properties. The idea was that they would come to town in their Sunday best, have a dance in the local shire hall, and hopefully meet a potential partner. These days B&S balls are more about alcohol, loud music and perhaps a sly pash. But with the increasing demands of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) laws, B&S balls have been struggling to remain operational and relevant. Andrew Greenwood is co-owner of the BNS Balls Australia website and Facebook group, which promotes B&S balls and offered consultancy to charity groups looking to put one on. He said the balls were becoming a rarity. ""Back in the 1990’s there was about 400 balls a year,"" Mr Greenwood said. ""There used to be at least a couple of B&S balls in Australia every weekend. ""Now there's only about 18 balls still going."" From the end of the 2000s, Mr Greenwood said there was an increase in pricing and ""governance of liquor licensing and insurance"". ""This meant a lot of the smaller balls and charity groups couldn't afford to run the events,"" he said. Mr Greenwood said liquor licensing had become even tougher in recent years. After more than 100 years of history, there are fears B&S balls might become a casualty of tightening liquor licensing laws. ""The way liquor licensing is today, it means that there's no money to be made by the charities and groups who used to run them,"" he said. ""They struggle to meet all the requirements. ""It's the same with insurance; there's so many restrictions that organisers can't run the balls anymore."" Another nail in the coffin for B&S balls has been COVID-19. ""Balls had capped numbers, which meant a lot of people couldn't attend,"" Mr Greenwood said. ""There's been a lot more restrictions as to what people can do at balls due to COVID. ""A lot of balls were community-funded and for some rural charities, the B&S ball was their main money raiser for the year and now they are now longer profitable."" Richmond Spouse Hunters Ball treasurer Lorrae Johnston said they had not held an event since 2019 due to several factors. ""We have had dwindling numbers for the past two to three years,"" she said. ""We have tried numerous things to encourage more patrons to attend and we have also had to cancel for the past few years due to COVID. ""We are hoping that 2023 will be our year."" The last post on The Toowoomba Hay Runners B&S ball Facebook page was in January 2019, which read: ""We regret to inform. But due to REDTAPE, Council Restrictions & Denied activity Applications. The Toowoomba Hay Runners B&S will be postponed at this stage. All ticket holders will be contacted in the next few days and a FULL REFUND issued."" In 2016, Swedish photographer Ingvar Kenne was working on a book about drunk Australia and, after photographing his first B&S ball, decided the book would be solely dedicated to the events. ""When I visited my first B&S ball at Goondiwindi, it was real eye opener, as the B&S ball is a uniquely Australian event,"" he said. ""I also learnt that there's a lot of friendly young people who work hard in the bush and, like all of us, they need an outlet to kick up some dust. ""They work long hard days in remote places far from people and when they do get a chance to meet up, they party quite hard."" Mr Kenne photographed 10 B&S balls between 2016 and 2018 and said that police and security had started to clamp down on B&S balls back then. ""There was talk that in the past B&S balls were even wilder, and that they were less regulated,"" he said. ""I've also heard of a few accidents where people were asleep in their swags and were driven over or there were accidents with utes doing burnouts. ""These days security and insurance have increased to point where the balls are no longer viable.""

25,Once bitten: Amy Shark calls for more protections for musicians and artists as she prepares for huge tour,arts-culture,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency ARIA award-winning singer Amy Shark is about to embark on a 60-date national tour, after COVID forced many artists to take a two-year hiatus. The tour, which starts in Western Australia this week, will take her to every state and territory, including to rural towns she has never been to and ""can't pronounce"". The Gold Coast artist said it was a welcome relief to be touring again after musicians were forced to quit gigging altogether during the pandemic, with forced closures and cancellations across the entire music and arts scene. She has called on the government ""to learn from what's happened"" and put safeguards in place to protect artists and prevent similar happenings again. ""I feel like it's coming to an end, but it's so uncertain,"" she said. ""We don't know, but I would hope that the powers that be would have learnt from what we've been through and try and get somewhat prepared. ""In case this does happen again, what are the procedures? ""How can we keep Australian music alive?"" While Shark was fortunate enough to play at a handful of COVID-safe events last year, she said many artists were forced to give up on their music careers entirely because of the financial stress of not performing throughout the pandemic. ""So, so many artists I know have just quit, they just can't financially do it anymore. ""And it's so sad, touring is the main source of income for many bands and artists and it was just taken away."" Shark said playing live music and being able to travel interstate and internationally for events is the entire premise of her line of work, and she was thrilled to see borders open again. She said after being forced into a live music and arts drought, she hoped the community might take the industry more seriously and understand it's ""real work"". ""Music just gets treated like its a pastime, even my family don't see it as work,"" she said. ""I'll get back from tour and they'll be like, 'how was your holiday?' ""I just feel like music it should be taken seriously a little more."" Shark has lived in Sydney for the past two years but said she had plans to move back home to the Gold Coast in Queensland, in between her busy schedule and upcoming mega-tour. ""I've obviously had to spend a lot of time abroad and in Sydney for the next wave of music and over COVID I just really missed home,"" she said. ""This is always going to be home to me. ""But yeah I'm really excited because I love going and finding these little gems here and there and I'm going to find some wacky, wonderful places, I'm not going to look at [my schedule] too intently because I just want to get on the bus and go, just arrive in a town. ""There are a few places here and there that we want to find some cool stuff to do, but I'm just going to get in the zone and make sure I'm putting on a good show each night, a balance of staying healthy and enjoying it as well.""

26,Meet the children's author better known as a Super Netball star,arts-culture," Sport Super Netball and NSW Swifts star Maddy Proud releases second children's book in Grace on the Court series For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency NSW Swifts co-captain Maddy Proud plays netball the same way she talks. Fast and frenetic, jumping from left to right, before making sense of her zig-zag route to the point. After the first eight rounds of Super Netball this year, Proud leads the competition for feeds (353) and goal assists (207). To some, it may look like a headless chook running around in a red and blue Swifts dress, but seasoned fans will know there is method behind the madness. It probably comes as no surprise that Proud writes in the same manner, thrashing the keyboard on her computer and throwing herself headfirst into the process. See, the reigning premiership winner is also an author and has just released her second book in the Grace on the Court series, targeting young girls and adolescents. ""I've found that my writing style is very much like the way I talk, and so I'll sit down and write thousands of words non-stop when I'm feeling inspired,"" Proud told The Netty Life podcast. ""Don't get me wrong, there are some days where I can't get anything out, so it is very much all or nothing with me in a lot of ways."" The narratives in Proud's books centre around the life of 13-year-old Grace Parker as she navigates her first years at high school and trialling in the junior netball pathways. The first edition was an instant hit with fans when it was published in 2018 and has become an ongoing source of inspiration for book week school outfits. Although Proud has taken four years to write the next, she's had a lot on her plate – rupturing her ACL, completing the gruelling rehab and helping the Swifts lift two Super Netball trophies. During the most recent grand final in 2021, she played with a broken rib. She has also completed a masters course in creative writing at Macquarie University, hoping to see her beloved pastime evolve into a legitimate career path. ""When I wrote the first book off the back of a World Youth Cup over 10 years ago, I did it with absolutely no expectations to publish and as something I just loved doing to escape,"" Proud said. ""It was a time in my life where I didn't have a lot going on other than netball, so it was almost therapeutic, and it wasn't until much further down the road that I realised it was something I wanted to get out into the world. ""So with this second book, I was a bit worried thinking, 'was it all a fluke?' ""If I'm going to call myself an author, then I should probably make sure I learn the craft. ""The course was a real eye-opener and an unreal experience: my lecturer became my mentor and it helped so much."" As a respected leader in the sport and with form that has seen her on the fringe of the Australian Diamonds squad, Proud is a popular figure within the netball community. Her down-to-earth personality means she doesn't take life too seriously, often poking fun at herself for regularly falling over on the netball court, and openly talking about her love of pop culture — especially singer Harry Styles. These characteristics, as well as the fact that Proud is unashamedly herself, make her especially relatable for young girls. It's something Proud cites as an important theme in her writing, too. ""The protagonist in my stories is quite relatable, she goes through experiences that most teenagers do during that transition from primary to high school, which is a really critical time. ""I tried to keep the story true with the problems and challenges that arise around balancing sport, friends and maybe love interests. ""I hope it helps readers deal with these things, whether they learn from her doing the right thing or sometimes making a mistake."" We're reached the halfway point of the 2022 Super Netball competition. Here are our picks for Team of the Season so far. In her main career as an elite netballer, Proud is often spoken about as being a role model. Now it seems her second job involves the same purpose: to set a good example. ""I love hearing parents say, 'my daughter loves reading and she never liked sport, but after reading your book she's trialling for the school team.' ""Or, 'my daughter loves netball and she wanted to read the book because you'd written it and although she'd never finished one before, she read yours cover to cover.' ""For me, sport was the saving grace that kept me focused and helped me enjoy school. ""I wouldn't be the person I am today without it, so if I can encourage one girl or boy to pick up a book or try sport, then that's my job done.""

28,"How subscription streaming killed this Victorian video store, one of the last ones left",arts-culture,"  It's closing credits for Colac Video, south-west Victoria's last video hire shop For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency South-west Victoria's last video rental shop will close at the end of the month after Colac Video owner Joe Argento decided it was time to hit the ""stop"" button. The store survived as part of the Colac streetscape into the 2020s as other video hire stores disappeared in surrounding Ballarat, Geelong and Warrnambool. However, as the trickle of customers to streaming services became a flood during the height of the pandemic, Mr Argento said he was forced to admit the day of the video store was over. ""It's finally caught up with us,"" he said. ""It's because of all the streaming services, and COVID just added to it. ""The way the technology is, though, I think it was inevitable. Year on year, it was a trend that was downhill and then there was COVID and people weren't able to come in. According to a 2021 Media Content Consumption Survey by the Social Research Centre, 79 per cent of Australian households have at least one subscription video-on-demand service. Mr Argento said that being in a small town has meant that his customers have been loyal. ""It is sad. We had really loyal, regular customers. They are all disappointed,"" he said. ""We have a lot from the Otways, too. Maybe the reception [for streaming] is still not very good there. ""We're only a small town and I was wondering how to keep it going, but Ballarat and Warrnambool – with much larger populations – their video shops closed a long time ago."" Colac Video was comparatively late to the video craze, opening about 22 years ago. Mr Argento said he took over the shop about 2011, then three years ago moved the store to a smaller location in an effort to reduce costs. In that time, south-west Victoria's final video shop became something of a curiosity. ""We had quite a few people from Melbourne wander past. They'd go into the shop with their kids to say this is what we used to do when we were your age,"" he said. ""I'd imagine there would be some kids who will never experience [going into a video shop]. ""We were still mainly hiring out the videos. We only started a little retail to see what we could do. For Mr Argento, the decision to close was a weighty one, but one he has not regretted. ""It was stressful and sad making the decision [to close] but, now it's been made, I do feel some relief,"" he said. ""I'm 72 so I've quite a lot of work to do at home that I haven't done because of the shop, and I need to catch up with the grandkids. Mr Argento said that in his experience, the Marvel superhero films continued to be the most popular films even as overall video hire declined. The store will remain open until the end of May. ""We're just hiring out the new releases,"" Mr Argento said. ""The weekly ones are actually cheaper to buy than to hire.""

29,Teenager stuns fashion legends with wool design,arts-culture,"  Runway success as designers weave merino wool into diverse range of garments for Fleece to Fashion Awards For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Wool has been taken off the sheep's back and woven into everything from sportswear to wedding gowns for the annual Fleece to Fashion Awards in the New England region of New South Wales on the weekend. It was a chance for the industry to promote its product through fashion, and after a two-year hiatus due to COVID, the event was bigger than ever, with guests filling Uralla's historic Deargee Woolshed on Saturday night. With eight categories to enter, a stand-out category this year was a new addition called Diversity in Wool, where entrants could celebrate their culture through their designs. Prominent Australian designer Johnathan Ward was one of the judges and said he was impressed by the broad range of fashions on display in that section of the awards. ""Incredible ... it was probably one of our biggest entries and there was a lot of diversity and interest,"" he said. ""What can be done with [wool] ... that category I was particularly interested in."" Mr Ward found the calibre of designs across all categories outstanding and the future of the design industry promising. ""All the judges had to really sit and look at each other and go back and go, 'OK, how do we stop fighting and decide who gets first and second in this category?'"" A 15-year-old Uralla Central School student won the MJ Bale Supreme Award, with Dechen Kandroher taking out the top prize for her design. The pantsuit, cape and clouche hat ensemble was made entirely from merino wool. Fleece to Fashion board director and wool grower Liz Foster said the design was outstanding. ""The judges were blown away by Dechen's entry – not only was it a stunning outfit, [but by] the fact it was made by a young student who started sewing at the age of nine to improve her skills and has been taking sewing classes with a professional dressmaker locally,"" Mrs Foster said. Dechen was also awarded the Winterbourne Pastoral Company Secondary School Award. She said merino wool was a special fibre to work with. ""I took my inspiration for the pantsuit from Chanel but I wanted to make something than could be dressed up for a special occasion or be worn on an everyday basis,"" she said. ""I also included a felt hat, which is something I had never designed or made before, which was a lot of fun."" Local wool grower Lachlan Fulloon is the chairman of Fleece to Fashion. He said the event was an important way to showcase the diversity of the fibre. ""Wool is a fibre that is very unique in its qualities,"" he said. ""For the local wool growers and growers throughout Australia and the world it's a good opportunity to see the fruits of our labour. ""It's quite amazing to see the designs that can come from that.""

30,'No limits': How poet Ellen van Neerven is queering sports writing,arts-culture," Sport 'No limits': How non-binary First Nations poet Ellen van Neerven is queering sports writing For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency It's difficult to know exactly how to categorise Ellen van Neerven's story No Limits. Part creative memoir, part reportage, part theoretical essay and part history lesson, the story weaves anecdotes of the poet's own childhood playing football with conversations between three friends – Maddee, Zaky and Louis – as they meditate on their own experiences as trans and gender-diverse people who participate in community sport. The genre of the piece is hard to pin down. It's broken up into uneven, non-chronological segments with sub-headings like ""SOVEREIGN GENDERS"", ""DIFFICULT JOY"" and ""POWER"". It easily slides between lyrical, descriptive first-person and objective, academic third-person. It dedicates entire sections to the interviewees' transcribed voices. It plucks phrases from writers and athletes like Siufung Law, Jaiyah Saelua and Essa May Ranapiri and it draws upon First Nations cultural knowledge, history and language while critiquing Western patriarchal conceptions of gender and sexuality. Of course, the difficulty — not knowing exactly where this piece fits within the broader web of Australian writing — is the point. Just as its title suggests, No Limits defies and complicates (or ""queers"") literary genres and forms in order to emphasise the radical nature of its subject matter: how trans and gender-diverse people challenge the traditional stereotypes and assumptions around gender and bodies that structure our everyday lives. For van Neerven, there are few better prisms through which to triangulate this conversation than through the complex, yet rigid, space of sport. ""I remember wanting to write something that was experimental and blurred the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction, and was something that didn't shy away from discussing sexuality or gender identity,"" van Neerven told the ABC. ""When I was growing up, sexuality was really repressed. The environment that I was in was a really suppressed kind of environment, so me writing about sexuality, sex and gender identity is pushing back against all of the suppression that I had when I was growing up. ""There were really strong stereotypes of what a queer person was or would look like or how they'd act. Lots of homophobic and transphobic slurs, racist slurs, coming left, right and centre. ""One of them was that if you play soccer, you're a lesbian. A lot of the girls I played with, they really pushed hard against that. If they were gay, they hid it. If they weren't, they were still affected by it because they created a hyper-hetero-feminine presentation in how they acted and dressed to fit in. ""People would ask me when I was 13 or 14: 'are you gay? Are you this? Are you that?' People would ask me, 'are you a boy or a girl?' All this stuff. I didn't really have any answers. ""Space politics is something I'm really interested in and that I try to represent in my work about sport. You're growing up and you're just trying to fit in and find your belonging: it's a really ripe subject matter to write about."" No Limits forms part of a larger collection of work that van Neerven is compiling into a book titled Personal Score, recently acquired by University of Queensland Press. When released, it will be one of the only collections of non-academic Australian sports writing told from the perspective of a queer, non-binary, First Nations writer, which also gives voice to some of the most marginalised communities within sport. It follows a small, if growing, trend of life writing in women's sport that examines the tensions of culture, gender and sexuality, including USA footballer Megan Rapinoe's One Life and Australian cricketer Alex Blackwell's Fair Game. ""With the incredible upsurge in the popularity of women's sport comes the potential to reshape the narratives around sport and culture,"" the press release reads. ""As Personal Score examines, many athletes challenge mainstream views of gender and sexuality and use sport and their role within it to effect change not only in their own sporting realm but more broadly in the wider culture and society. ABCQueer has compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQI+ people, their families and friends. ""Moreover, van Neerven interrogates the implications of playing sport on stolen land and how this complicates questions of identity around sport, who plays it, and where. ""Thus, Personal Score is also a meditation on Indigenous connections to place and land, examining the earliest sports played here and paying tribute to influential First Nations sportspeople."" It's a particularly timely work in light of recent discourses around the inclusion of trans women in Australian sport. In No Limits, van Neerven hands the microphone to the LGBTQIA+ people that recent debate has talked largely around, but rarely to, about their experiences — a majority of whom participate and will be affected at the community level. Like the author, each of the interviewees reflects on their childhoods and the role of sport in their social, physical and psychological lives. Maddee played basketball and netball. Zaky was a state representative in badminton. Louis played Aussie rules and became a national champion futsal goalkeeper. But as each of them — including van Neerven — grew older and came to consciousness of their gender identities, some of them undertaking the extensive process of hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgery, their relationship with sport and its communities changed. As strict gender binaries were more heavily enforced, and as cultures of homophobia and transphobia began to manifest in more blatant (and dangerous) ways, they all had times where they quit sport altogether. ""Fewer than 20 per cent of trans people play sport in Australia and even fewer participate in team sport,"" van Neerven writes. ""Often, LGBTIQSB+ children grow up feeling like they don't have a place in sport where they can authentically be themselves without fear of judgement, harassment, abuse, or violence. ""When TGD [trans and gender-diverse] people are denied sport, they miss out on enduring friendships that often transcend many divides. They don't pose a threat to sport, but they are the survivors of vicious transphobic campaigns to exclude them from what is a fundamental human right. ""Colonial gender binaries hold up the Western patriarchy. TGD identities – including sistergirls and brotherboys, pan-First Nations terms that describe some TGD people in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander communities — don't fit into the rigid colonial understandings of gender. Sistergirls, brotherboys and gender-diverse Aboriginal Australians from around the country have come together in Melbourne to share stories of culture, identity and struggle. ""I have never felt like a girl or a woman. I feel masculine in some ways and feminine in others, as if there are two spirits living within me, harmoniously. ""If sport is 'sex-segregated', heteronormative and explicitly trans-exclusionary, what kind of world is created, violently policed, and upheld? ""These spaces are forceful dystopias, complete departures from the liberated lives our ancestors had."" One of the effects of No Limits, and by extension Personal Score, is that it helps rewrite wider narratives around the realities of trans and gender-diverse people participating in sport. By engaging wholeheartedly with the tangle of the personal and the political, and by giving voice and agency to the most marginalised in the community, van Neerven's writing combats the arguments and assumptions put forward by louder voices elsewhere that contribute to discrimination towards people who sit outside essentialist framings of gender. ""There's so many transphobic pieces in The Australian every month, and they're just about the most marginalised group wanting to participate in sport, but instead they get all this propaganda and there's not much reporting at all on the people who are actually playing the sport,"" van Neerven said. ""The reporting is about whether they should play sport. That's a huge problem. ""We need to reframe this stuff and actually ask athletes themselves what they want to talk about. We never ask sportspeople what narratives they want to tell about themselves; what narratives they want to tell about their broader worlds, you know? ""So when you have journalists and politicians acting in a certain way — that don't bother exploring the nuances or different experiences of something — it's so defeating. ""That's the interesting stuff we've missed out on: people talking about their lives in interesting ways and not further perpetuating stereotypes. ""Australia really uses sport as a propaganda machine to say, 'we're a white nation, we're a patriarchal nation, we're the land of the underdog, the battlers, this and that.' It's really hard to push up against it, but we have to try."" As van Neerven's interviewees explain, gender-non-conforming people and sport do not have to be mutually exclusive. Louis dreams of returning to play futsal in a mixed team after top surgery. Maddee has become a competitive powerlifter. Zaky, for now, simply walks while reflecting on his position on and relationship with Wurundjeri land. It is sport itself, then, that must acknowledge and adapt to the changing face of Australia's communities: to open up, to adjust or to collapse entirely its rigid binary categories in order to become a genuinely diverse, inclusive place. Importantly, No Limits closes with all four voices reflecting on their versions of sport utopias, where ""utopia"" functions as a way of critiquing the current state of things. Despite what feels like insurmountable challenges, there remains a kindling of hope that sport is not so set in its ways that it is incapable of imagining alternatives to the way things have always been. ""[Utopia] would just be where trans people are free to play as the gender that they want to,"" Louis says. ""I don't know whether that means we abolish the gender segregation of sports […] It would just be that women are encouraged to play sport at an early age in the same way men are."" ""Every time you create a gendered structure around the sport, it's going to affect the way that people see themselves and engage in the sport,"" Maddee says. ""They are trying to design a perfect system that works for everyone … that doesn't work because the whole idea of sports being fair in the first place isn't real. ""Most of the time, trans people just want to get out there and exist in a sport and enjoy training. If you can't pause and exist in a moment, there's no point."" Perhaps the most radical and profound sports utopia is the one imagined by Zaky — one in which gender no longer exists. A place of no limits. ""My utopia isn't a trans utopia,"" he says. ""My utopia is a utopia where everyone gets to find pleasure and joy in moving their body, be aggressive and be strong and be together in that space, despite their gender. Which in itself is a trans utopia. It's my utopia and I happen to be trans. This is what I hope for the future."" As van Neerven concludes: ""My utopia looks for a day when TGD people's inclusion in sport is not news and not up for debate, when no one has to fight to have a space and when we move on from reports of inclusion to reports of playing. ""Playing — and living: I insist on doing both.""
