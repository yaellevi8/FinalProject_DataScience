In some ways it's a prime slot — kicking off the most anticipated round since the opener — but it's also a graveyard slot — off free-to-air telly and starting as people get home from work or cook dinner. It was also only ever going to be a curtain-raiser to the main event, Brisbane vs Manly. With Newcastle dropping just below Canterbury to 16th on the ladder last week, it ensured the graveyard slot would be occupied by two teams effectively dead on arrival. The NRL got lucky. The people who turned up at 6pm on a Friday, less so. While the Bulldogs seem spurred on by years of futile toil at the bottom of the ladder, energised by new faces and excited by the very prospect of building towards something, Newcastle appear shellshocked to find themselves where they are. Their attack lacks spark, even with Kalyn Ponga at the back, although he looks more static than electric right now. They managed to trip over the finish line first — 16-6 — but even Knights coach Adam O'Brien couldn't watch at one point, storming out of the box when Leo Thompson dropped the ball from here. Mercifully for Thompson and fittingly for the match, the Bulldogs went up the other end and Chris Patolo also dropped the ball cold. Both mentors could have been forgiven for feigning health and safety protocols to get out of dodge, because there were any number of similar passages of play where the teams looked rudderless. At the end of an energetic, if flawed, opening stanza, on the last play of the first half, Edrick Lee moved almost 20 metres in-field to slide out wide on a left-side shift. He got a wide ball from Kalyn Ponga and was met, by not just opposite number Jayden Okunbor, but Brent Naden. Then Kyle Flanagan. Then Tevita Pangai Jr. The Bulldogs' sliding defence matched the lateral attack so easily that it must have stunned the Bulldogs that the Knights were making it that easy. The set before that, the ball went to ground between Lee and Bradman Best on a similarly ineffective slide. The play after that, Tex Hoy kicked dead on the full and crocked his shoulder. Starting from 20 metres out with seven tackles under their belt, the Bulldogs replied by failing to run at the one-armed man defending at a narrow right centre, then knocked it on before reaching the third tackle. In the second half, Newcastle strung together enough competent seconds for Ponga to put Bradman Best past some ordinary Bulldogs defence. But, true to form, the Knights knocked on off the ensuing set. Continuing the theme, the Bulldogs failed to pack the scrum in time but were still allowed to play on, only to watch fullback Matt Dufty drop the ball on the scrumbase play. It was a miracle Peter V'landys didn't get on the blower before full-time and change the rules to make this win only worth one point, but by the time it was over and the Lang Park light show started, it was clear that wasn't Magic Round's opening act; just the support act. Before the 16-team, eight-game festival of footy was official, Manly had a habit of taking the occasional home game up to Brisbane. That was evident in the support they got from the Lang Park crowd on Friday night, paired with a few refrains of Eagle Rock and coupled with some Brookvale-level booing of Adam Reynolds every time he lined up a shot at goal. The bad news for those booing was that Reynolds was lining them up a lot. Seven times to be exact. And all of them went through — the only blemish being a wayward field-goal attempt late in the first half. For the second week in a row, Reynolds played conductor, with Selwyn Cobbo and Corey Oates first and second chair violins, and Payne Haas and Pat Carrigan setting the tempo in the percussion section as the Broncos trampled their opponents. Last week it was reigning grand finalists South Sydney, this week it was a Manly side with superstar Tom Trbojevic featuring in his second game back from injury. But the gun fullback featured in the opening blunder of the game, allowing the kick-off to bounce between himself and Kieran Foran, rolling dead and handing possession back to the Broncos. Reynolds and Cobbo combined for the first time, soon after, and Brisbane — 14th last year and stone-dead last in 2020 — were off and running. Freak starts like that have happened to Brisbane over the past two years, but they've almost always let them slip with silly mistakes, lazy defence and bad execution. This time they never looked like slowing down. Trbojevic was clearly labouring at the back and couldn't impact the game, but you got the sense even at the peak of his powers, the end result would have been the same (though maybe not as emphatic as the 38-0 scoreline that eventuated). The aforementioned stars were of course excellent, as were Kurt Capewell, Kotoni Staggs and Herbie Farnworth. Crucially, Billy Walters is hitting his stride, in this case meaning passes from dummy half are finally hitting Reynolds in stride, starting Brisbane's attack off on the right note more often than not. Even the rain that has battered Brisbane for two weeks straight held off for most of the night, only really returning for the final 25 minutes to ensure Oates could have a fun slip and slide as he dove in for his double. On a night when four NRL teams took to the park, the Broncos looked by far the most competent, complete and copacetic of the lot.

2,The diabolically simple question that tripped Morrison,analysis-and-opinion," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Today brings the end of Week Five, and confirmation that the Prime Minister has reached the bargaining phase in the crushing 360-degree employee review that this campaign has become. These moments are never easy to witness. Here's how it happened. In the at-risk Victorian Liberal electorate of Chisholm, whither the PM had repaired to fiddle with motherboards at a tech factory and wax lyrical about the Member for Chisholm, Gladys Liu, in front of an underwhelmed-looking cohort of lab-coated employees, the PM assumed the position for his daily press conference. Sky News reporter Andrea Crothers — part of the travelling media pack well accustomed to the PM's fondness for avowing what ""Australians know"" to be true — slipped in a diabolically simple question. ""Prime Minister, isn't part of your problem that you keep telling them what they know, rather than listening?"" Now, asking Scott Morrison a question is easy. Getting an answer is harder. And more often than not, you get the answer to the question the PM would have liked you to ask, rather than the one you actually did. And in this case, he started out by explaining that Australians know him for his strength and decisiveness during the pandemic. A classic interview manoeuvre from the ""What's my weakness? Oh, I guess it's probably that I'm a workaholic"" job interview school. But having started talking, he somehow couldn't stop. ""I know [that] Australians know I can be a bit of a bulldozer when it comes to issues,"" he confided. For a man who loves to be photographed hard-hattedly astride various pieces of heavy machinery, the revelation that to some extent he actually identifies as a vehicle feels… significant. But it didn't stop there, either. ""As we go into this next period on the other side of the pandemic, I know things that are going to have to change with the way I do things,"" Mr Morrison continued. For the entire time he's been in office, Mr Morrison's entire offering has been incumbency. ""I'm the Prime Minister,"" he likes to remind people. As of today, however, he's prepared to be a different kind of guy, if we'll just give him another chance. A clearly thrilled Anthony Albanese, in Cairns, found himself 10 yards out and dead in front of the sticks. Not always, with this player, an absolute guarantee of points, but today he did not miss, booting two in quick succession. ""A bulldozer knocks things over,"" said the Labor leader. ""I'm a builder, that's what I am. If I'm elected prime minister, I will build things in this country. ""This government has been there for almost a decade, this prime minister has four years in office, and what he's saying is, 'If you vote for Scott Morrison, I'll change'. ""That's what he's saying. 'Vote for me and I'll change'. Well, if you want change, change the government."" Late-campaign handbrake turns are extremely tricky to pull off. In 2007, keen to repair the damage from a botched cabinet assassination attempt against John Howard, Howard and his grumpy deputy Peter Costello granted a joint interview to Today Tonight to demonstrate that they had a new and warm relationship. It was fascinatingly awkward, and of course did not work. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. The worst damage to the Prime Minister from today isn't that people now think any worse of him or will forever picture him staring at himself in the mirror of a morning and softly saying ""Brrrooooommmm"". It's that to a messy and disjointed prime ministerial campaign that so far has been about jobs, but also China, but also dentists, but also who's allowed to play in the girls' team, you can now add an exciting new discussion about how the PM is planning to change and why. A shocker. It's why when asking our daily question about who had a Good Day and who had a Bad Day, the answer for Friday, May 13 is — in order – Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison. It's odd to call it an election launch when more than a million people will have already voted and it's less than a week until the big day, but that's exactly what Scott Morrison and the Coalition has in front of it this Sunday. While Labor held their launch in Perth, the Liberals stumped up for Brisbane — not ideal when the city is struggling with heavy downpours and flooding for the umpteenth time this year. Behind in the polls, Morrison's launch will be his last major event to win over undecided voters We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

3,"Scott Morrison makes a late campaign strategy shift, acknowledging he's been a 'bulldozer'",analysis-and-opinion," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Liberal Party is so acutely conscious of Scott Morrison's unpopularity that its pitch to voters has been crafted to accommodate it. ""It's not a popularity test,"" Mr Morrison said at the outset of the six-week long election campaign. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. ""You go to the dentist, it doesn't matter if you like him or not. You want to know they're good at their job."" Having your teeth drilled into is a particularly unpleasant experience to compare your leadership to, but it was an effort to suggest skill and hardiness are more important for a Prime Minister than likeability. ""You may not like everything we've done, you may not like me that much, but that's not the point,"" he said at the time. It was an analogy used by colleagues, too, particularly Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, who has returned to the comparison of his colleague to a physically painful procedure several times. Given just a year ago he was calling Mr Morrison a ""hypocrite"" and a ""liar"" in private text messages, one might presume Mr Joyce doesn't much like going to the dentist. But the Prime Minister has changed his tune as he enters the final week of the campaign, trailing in the polls and momentum swinging behind Labor. ""I know (that) Australians know I can be a bit of a bulldozer when it comes to issues,"" he conceded. ""As we go into this next period on the other side of the pandemic, I know things that are going to have to change with the way I do things."" A promise to change, if given the chance, ""because we're moving into a different time, a time of opportunity."" In campaign terms, it is a tectonic shift. With eight days to go until the May 21 poll, the appeal for voters to stick with a known quantity has been re-cast as a vow to transform anew. The Scott Morrison of the last three years will be different to the Scott Morrison in the years ahead, he offers. Labor sees not a dentist, nor a bulldozer, but a leopard that will not be capable of changing its spots. ""If you want change, change the government,"" Anthony Albanese said, pouncing on the Prime Minister's words scarcely an hour after he uttered them. ""Don't look for Scott Morrison to change, because that's not going to happen. Just change the government."" Said with a gusto that has often missing from the Labor leader's stump speeches, Mr Albanese leant into the Prime Minister's words. ""A bulldozer wrecks things, a bulldozer knocks things over. I'm a builder, that's what I am. And if I'm elected Prime Minister, I'll build things in this country."" Labor's campaign headquarters was just as quick to capitalise on the comments on social media. They've both spent their lives in politics but come May 21, one will be prime minister and the other will likely face the end of their political career. A long, six-week campaign was a deliberate choice by the Liberal Party, knowing the maximum amount of time was needed to make the case for a fourth term in office. Throughout, Mr Morrison has carefully calibrated his words, his tone and his focus in an effort to work with, rather than challenge, impressions of his character. To alter the strategy so drastically, and so late, in the campaign suggests a desperation at campaign headquarters. The dial isn't shifting for Scott Morrison. Until now, the election contest has been characterised as between a man that people don't know and a man that people don't like. Now, it is between a man whose election would instantly bring change and a man who is promising to change himself, if just given one more chance.

4,The life and death of City v Country — how the legacy of league's much loved rep game lives on,analysis-and-opinion,"  Campo's Corner: The life and death of City v Country — how the legacy of league's much loved rep game lives on For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tariq Sims did the same thing every single year. He'd mark out his goals for the season to come, and he'd always aim high – premiership wins, New South Wales Origin jerseys, all the dreams you can imagine. But before he could do any of that, something else had to come first. Because before Sims was a Blue, before he was a Dragon or a Knight or a Cowboy, before he was anything else in football, he was a Gerringong Lion. He was from the country, and that meant a lot. So Sims turned up, again and again, for Country Origin in their annual clash with City. From 2012, when he debuted, until 2017, when the game finally faded away, he was there. Towards the end, plenty of NRL players pulled out, either through their own volition or after pressure from their clubs, who feared injuries for their stars and in the end caused the death of this match that was once a staple of the rugby league calendar. But Sims never did. Not ever. He finished with six caps for Country Origin, one short of Laurie Daley's record of seven, and he's as proud of that as he is anything he has done in rugby league. ""Going away for the week, immersing yourself in the history of the jersey and giving back to the country, representing the people from the bush, there was nothing like it,"" Sims says. ""Pulling on that maroon jersey with the gold V, that was so special to me. It was a stepping-stone to Origin, a chance to prove yourself, and playing against other New South Welshmen in the City team, personally it felt like one of the real rivalries. ""Once you're committed you have to give it your all. That's the bush mentality, you can't do things half-arsed, you have to go out there and have a go. ""We played with our heart on our sleeve, and we wanted to play tough, we wanted to be a team the country could be proud of."" First played in 1911, by the end of City-Country's long life span it was regarded as a remnant of a world which no longer existed, a holdover from a different era of rugby league, when country footy and the Sydney competition were of truly comparable quality and somebody could still earn state or national selection by playing anywhere in New South Wales. The slow decline of the country competitions and the gradual rise of the Sydney premiership into the NRL we know today, meant City-Country became something else — a trial for a New South Wales Origin berth and an opportunity to represent one's hometown or suburb on a big stage. Then slowly, bit by agonising bit, this game was chipped away until, five years ago, it was ended as a top-line match. Rugby league hasn't been the same since, because the secret truth of City-Country was that it was always more than it was said to be — it wasn't just a selection trial, or a game on a Sunday afternoon, it was a celebration of some of the game's most unheralded heroes, a week of recognition for parts of this sport that are so often overlooked. Like the pre-season All Stars game, the match itself was as much a culmination as it was a showpiece. Winning the game mattered, and playing well mattered, but the community work during the week, inspiring the next generation and connecting with the people who keep the game alive in the bush, was just as crucial. That's why it still had meaning to the end, even if the stars didn't come out for it like they once did and it was easy to sneer at a game that had, to many, lost a lot of cachet. But when you were in town when City-Country was on and you could see what it meant in person, then the value of the game was easy to understand. Plenty of the game's critics wouldn't take that trip over the mountains or up or down the coast or into the west. You don't need to be from the country to understand what the jersey meant, you just have to be from somewhere and be proud of it. ""I always pride myself on how I represent where I'm from, my family, my junior team, my mates. To pull that jersey on, it really does mean something to you, and it gives hope to kids from the bush when they see you wear it,"" Sims says. ""It's not that often that NRL teams play in the bush, for kids to see a game live was a big deal to them. Inspiring the next generation of kids coming through, that played a big part in what you were trying to represent. ""Maybe we went to their school, or they came to the game and met a player afterwards, and maybe that's what inspired them to chase their dream. That was something that always stood out to me."" The NRL has compensated for the loss of City-Country by playing more games in regional areas, which are, in their own right, important to keeping the game alive in country New South Wales. But there's a difference between having a game in one town and having a team playing for the entire bush. A single game can only be played in one place at a time, but a rep team is different – it's right there in the name. They represent something much larger than just one place. It doesn't just inspire kids, it lifts up everyone around the game. Sims could always feel that through his long career for Country, no matter if the game was played in Mudgee, Coffs Harbour, Dubbo or Wagga Wagga. That's the thing about the country – some things are the same wherever you go. ""You don't go in the sheds after the game, you stay on the field and the fans come to you, and it just has that nice country vibe, which I've always really enjoyed,"" Sims says. ""I'm sure it was the same for the City boys when they talked to kids who wanted to be where they were. Out in the country we'd see people who would drive three or four hours just to watch us train. ""It was a big deal to them, and it was a big deal for us to play for them. The people in the bush don't get seen or heard as often as they should, so to go out there and make them proud, it meant a lot to me."" It still does. Sims is 32 and much closer to the end of his career than the start, but if he had the chance he'd pull the Country jersey on without question, so long as they'd have him. ""I'd absolutely play if they still had it. If there was a chance to represent the country it would always be a goal. If the coach picked me I'd be frothing,"" Sims says. ""Being able to represent the bush is always a big deal, and there's a lot of pride there. ""I think if you asked a lot of the Country guys they'd say the same thing – that they have a responsibility to inspire the next generation."" But Sims will never get that chance in the same way again. Neither will the players who come after him. As a top-level match, City-Country is long gone. It wasn't a sudden death. It took years, and it died a little bit at a time via a series of small cuts that added up in the end. A break can be mended, but disintegration cannot. A rope which has been cut can be tied back together, but it cannot be fixed if it's been allowed to rot away. Clubs and coaches stopped allowing their charges to play, citing the risk of injury, which impacted the star power of the game which, in turn, led many to challenge the relevance of the concept in modern age. The catchcry was that the game was no longer a genuine Origin trial, and thus it was considered pointless. But the true benefits were not in dollars and cents, or in giving the Blues coach a form guide, but in hearts and minds that were won and recognised, and in the future the game could inspire. Given we live in a cold world of balance sheets and bottom lines, that was never going to be enough. The game could not be saved in the end, so when it was consigned to the history books at the end of 2017 it was for the best and worst of reasons. Even though rugby league is a sport obsessed with nostalgia, to the point where it can occasionally consume the game and blind it to a better future, that nostalgia does not always seem to apply equally. Every few months there's a story about how bush footy is on it's knees, how it's withering on the vine and being forgotten. You can set your watch to them arriving. There's a lot of truth in most of them, because money is tight and a lot of country towns are declining and it's harder to put a team together than it used to be. Having a week of celebration and recognition, which showed the country was important to rugby league, and the people there did matter, and the millionaires in the ivory towers hadn't forgotten about them and what they did for the game, meant something. The match mattered, and so did everything around it. It was further proof that rugby league as a sport can be so much larger than just the 16 clubs that make up the NRL as the size and scale of the elite competition and the Origin series and the money they generate threaten to swallow up the nooks and crannies that make a sport larger than a single league. Representative football gives rugby league a different flavour, one people always seem to enjoy if they're just given a chance to enjoy it. For proof, look no further than international football, which came so far in the years leading up to COVID before the pandemic slammed the breaks on Test matches. It is only now those types of matches are getting off the ground again, and even then with plenty of resistance from the clubs. Their fear of injury or player burnout is understandable, and clubs looking after their own interests is to be expected, but the game has the potential to be so much larger than 16 teams. City-Country was beyond saving by the end. It's passing was assured many years before the plug was finally pulled. It's easy to consign it to the other novelties of league's past that were left behind when the time came for it, like the Amco Cup or contested scrums. But instead of being a curio or a novelty for the rugby league trainspotter, the end City-Country should instead serve as a warning. This was a game played since 1911, and it meant so much to so many, but if it can be allowed to die then almost can anything can be killed. Selling the country part of City-Country has always been easy. Giving good old boys from the bush a chance to represent the small towns that made them, make their families and communities proud and giving a day in the sun to a part of rugby league so rarely afforded that type of recognition – who could possibly object to it? For City, the equation isn't so simple. Country fellas, for the most part, can find a lot of common ground regardless if they come from Cobar or Forster or anywhere in-between but Sydney, with it's vast sprawl, is harder to get a handle on, especially when it comes to rugby league given the sport was built on tribalism between the different suburbs. Being a country boy can be a way of life, but there's no song called 'Thank God I'm a City Slicker'. Enter Brad Fittler, who became City-Country's great champion in it's final, difficult years. Fittler took over as City coach in 2011 and stayed in charge until the match was wound up at the end of 2017. A seven-time City rep as a player, the match was always important to Fittler. ""It was a game I grew up watching, a game I grew up playing when it was a trial match for Origin. It was always my first step into the next level,"" Fittler says. ""One thing I was very aware of when I got into coaching was the workload on players. I always tried to choose players I thought would benefit from a week in camp, and I thought that worked really well. ""You try to use it as a time to revitalise a career, or give a young bloke a go or give a fella who might be on the way out one last week in camp. I saw a lot of different benefits of the game over different times. ""It was something I always enjoyed, and I enjoyed getting out to the country. I loved getting out there, talking to the people, and I got a real joy in beating them as well."" As NRL stars fell away from the fixture, Fittler never stopped treating the game with the utmost respect. It was a week to be enjoyed, but there was always a game to be won and a jersey to be honoured. ""I remember one day I was calling on the forwards, calling them cats and taking the ball up to them,"" Fittler says. ""When you have (assistant coach) Tony Butterfield next to you and he's five years older and still taking it up you think 'I can't let him do it on his own'. Hanging around Tony Butterfield for a week is always a fun thing to do, he's a good man and very passionate. ""It must have fired them up, because Mitch Allgood, who played for us that year, sat me on my arse. It's a good memory. ""You have to hand it to the players. The prestige didn't run with it like it once did, but they saw how serious I was about the game, and there was always a reason to do it well rather than neglect it and just treat it like another game of footy."" Fittler found small ways to build a bond in the short camp. He would call in fellow City alumni from his playing days and have them speak about the pride of the jersey, how it felt to have become a City man, and how far a good performance could take them. He would take his players into the heart of Sydney, to somewhere like the Hope Street Hostel, and have them cook dinner for those less fortunate. At junior clinics he would send them on to the field with the words ""go out there and change a child's life"". ""One thing I always tried to teach them was the demographics of the city, what happens in there, the good and the bad of the city, and a bit of the history. Just little touches along the way,"" Fittler says. ""We had a great reaction to that, some of my greatest times were coaching City teams, it was always a lot of fun because it was light but they knew there would be rewards for good games, for excellence. ""A lot of players bought in, which surprised me. A lot of coaches didn't buy in, and that didn't surprise me, because I'd been a coach and I'd see that side of it. ""I always tried to be selective, I'd speak to coaches, some pulled players out while others allowed players to come in. It was a tricky one, but I'd like to think we got it right more than we didn't."" The records show Fittler did more than just that. He won three, drew one and lost two of his six matches in charge for City, a remarkable record given he was almost always coaching a heavy underdog. One year he picked Addin Fonua-Blake, only for the NSWRL to rule he was ineligible. Another time he picked a young James Tedesco, who had played just four NRL matches at the time. A couple of years later he picked Ryan Matterson, who'd only played two. Eight other players in the side that year had appeared in less than 40 NRL games. They played against a Country team that boasted Jack Wighton, Isaah Yeo, James Maloney, Jack Bird, Jack de Belin, Tyson Frizell, Boyd Cordner and Dale Finucane, and the City boys won, handily, with guys like Kyle Lovett and Aaron Gray playing blinders in a 44-30 win. But even that couldn't compare to the chaos of the final game in 2017. Things were already looking dicey when Paul Gallen was asked to return from representative retirement for one last ride, to hopefully inspire some players to stick it out. Ten minutes before the side was to be named, a press release was issued saying the announcement would be delayed because City didn't have the numbers. Calls were made across the league for somebody, anybody who grew up in Sydney and wanted to be part of something, to come on down. One of the calls reached Phil Gould at Penrith, who had coached Fittler for club, City and state in the past, and he had the guys for the job. ""I rocked up to Panthers training and the coach called me into his office and asked if I wanted to play for City, and I jumped at it. We all came in midweek, Gal was already there and I joined the group and being part of a side coached by Freddy, that was pretty special,"" then Penrith prop James Tamou says. ""Rep footy is about coming together, and that's hard to do on short notice. It's hard to build connections and trust and everything else in a few days. ""Freddy was big on making those connections. The forwards all went for early morning walks together, for example, and we didn't have to talk about footy, we just had to be together. ""You can't train much, but building those connections is more important and Freddy understands that, that was the secret sauce that brought everyone together."" Even with the addition of Panthers stars Tamou, Matt Moylan, Nathan Cleary, Bryce Cartwright and Tyrone Peachey, City had to dig deep into the bullpen to find a 17 to take on the old rivals one last time. Dragons forward Hame Sele, who had come off the bench in each of his four NRL appearances, started at lock. Two of the subs, Jake Marketo and Pauli Pauli, were picked from reserve grade. Neither man had played a first grade game all year, and between the two of them they would only ever play one more in their careers. But it didn't matter. They were City men, and they were willing and that's all Fittler needed. It wasn't about how good he made them, it's how he made them good. Tamou, in his first and only match for City, played one of the games of his life, Gallen rolled back the years in what proved to be the final rep game he ever played and managed came together in what remains one of the great feats of Fittler's coaching career to down a far more star-studded Country side 20-10 and win eternal bragging rights, because what's already happened can't ever change. ""They were favourites, because our team came together so late, we were almost like a group of bandits that got thrown together and rolled into town. But everyone who put their hand up did a job,"" Tamou says. ""It all came together for us, it all came out that day in Mudgee. ""At that point in time I'd played for Australia and New South Wales, but you never want to stop playing rep footy. If someone rings you up and asks if you want to play City-Country you should say yes straight away. ""It wasn't just a trial match for Origin, it was a rep game on it's own. The passion that comes into it, it's a dream come true for those country blokes and for us as well. It's always been that battle. ""You go to any country town, they want to tear your head off cause you're a city boy. That battle has always been there. It was sad to see it go, but it's a jersey I'll treasure."" Long after the annual conversations of City-Country being a genuine State of Origin trial have ceased, its impact is still being felt in the game's harshest arena. Of the 64 players who debuted for New South Wales between 2010 and 2020, 56 of them played City-Country. Even that last day in Mudgee proved to be a hotbed of future Blues stars despite so many withdrawals as 11 players, including Sims, Cleary, Damien Cook, Josh Addo-Carr, Cody Walker and Dale Finucane, went on to play for New South Wales in the years since ""Even though we're playing against other New South Welshmen we all did the same moves and same plays so once we did get into Origin it was seamless,"" says Sims, who made his Origin debut the year after City-Country wrapped up and has gone on to appear five times for the Blues under Fittler. ""There was no gelling period, we just jumped straight in. We already knew what was needed, we knew what was required to perform at that level. ""It's a great stepping stone to that level."" But City-Country was more than the making of the players – it was the making of Fittler as a coach. Given Fittler now has the same win percentage in charge of the Blues as Gould, it's easy to forget his stock as a coach was not high when he took over City ten years ago. His time in charge of the Roosters was tumultuous and inconsistent, and by his own admission he was far from the coach he would become. But plenty of the hallmarks that have helped him become one of the state's most decorated coaches were honed during his time with City. All the Fittler trademarks – like forcing players to bond by asking them to stay off their phones, forging strong links to the community to give the people they're representing a human face, giving players the support to play their natural game and the confidence to execute it under pressure – aren't just inventions he cooked up once he took the big job. Before Fittler asked his Blues players to go to a corner of Lang Park or Stadium Australia and think about every person who got them where they are today, the people they were playing for once they got out there, he asked his City players to do the same at the Glen Willow Sportsground in Mudgee. ""A lot of times our team maybe wasn't as strong as theirs, but we were always very competitive and it gave me confidence that it works, the stuff I did worked,"" Fittler says. ""If the players wanted to have a go, they could have a go. It gave me confidence. ""Speaking to Paul Gallen, after the game he played at the end, I think he surprised himself with how much he enjoyed it. ""In a lot of the camps we had a lot of fun. It was almost the last of the camps where you could have a good night out like it used to be."" While Fittler holds many fond memories of City-Country, and was the game's greatest advocate during it's last days, he knows it won't ever return in it's old form. ""I'm nearly on the other side now. I understood towards the end, how delicate it is with players, but we never had many injuries, I think Matt Moylan broke his thumb one year but that's about it,"" Fittler says. ""I was always grateful we got through it unscathed, because there's a big workload on the players."" It is how it is, Fittler says, and besides – the game isn't dead. Not all the way, anyway. ""They run it in the juniors now, my young bloke is playing in the City 16s this weekend,"" he says. ""It still has a purpose."" Zach Fittler will indeed emulate his father and wear the blue and gold of City this Saturday at Brookvale Oval. The Under 16s clash is part of the revamped City-Country weekend, which the NSWRL introduced last year. The NRL players won't be there, even if they wished they could be, because the NRL is holding it's Magic Round on the same weekend. But there will be more maroon and gold and blue and yellow than you could ever ask for with Under 16s, boys and girls Under 18s, men's and women's police, physical disability and wheelchair matches to be played, as well as men's and women's opens games. The women's game will have some of the NRLW's biggest stars, because it is still a true fight for Blues spots, but the men's game won't quite have the same shine. City will be represented by the best of the Ron Massey Cup, which sits a tier below reserve grade, while Country is made up of players from all over the bush. It's back to the old ways, residential rules, and the passion is still there. ""People might belittle you and say it's not an Origin trial,"" says Hamish Oxley, who played for Country in 2021. ""But getting to wear that jersey was the proudest thing I've ever done in football. I understand it's not an Origin trial or anything like that, and I don't want to sound like a flog, but it makes you feel on top of the world."" Oxley, who plies his trade for Oakdale Workers in the Macarthur Rugby League competition, is a self-described bush footy battler. Last year's Country team, which was thrown together with players from all over the state, was filled with guys just like him. ""I was the only player from my comp who got picked, I roomed with a guy from Cooma, the team was from everywhere but because we're all country guys we have a lot in common. Plenty of them let go of the NRL dream when they were 18 or 19, but they're still weapon footy players,"" Oxley says. ""The whole thing had this real professional feel, we were in camp for seven days and it was one of the best weeks of my life. I was 29, but it makes you feel like a kid, you feel like you've made it. ""You go into a room and see Terry Campese standing there with Beau Scott, two guys who are legends and played for Country. ""They coached the side for free, and they gave us a spiel when we first came into camp that those weeks they spent with the Country side were some of the best weeks of their careers, and they just wanted to give back to country footy. ""They still felt like they owed country footy something. There was a lot of pride."" City got the job done against the bush boys in their meeting last year. It was a bit of a belting as well, with the pride of Sydney running out 38-12 winners. But for proof it wasn't just a week on the piss and a bit of a run around, look no further than the man of the match that day – Soni Luke. Luke has since earned his belated NRL debut with the Panthers. He's living proof City-Country can still be a step towards something greater, even if it's not a sky blue jersey. Penrith's Soni Luke rise from park footy to the NRL is an overnight success story years in the making. ""It was a great experience. It was a great stepping stone for me, I got a lot of recognition for it. I still think there's room in the game for it,"" Luke says. ""I got to represent my junior club, St Mary's, and they were wrapped for us. It was so good, I'm really lucky."" Still, things aren't the same as they used to be. There's no more travelling roadshow out to some small country town where the players are welcomed like conquering heroes. Fans don't drive hours just to watch them train anymore. Blues Origin jerseys aren't on the line, and there's no more guns in the valley. But it's still City and it's still Country. The colours are still the same. There is still a clear line that is over a hundred years long which begins all the way back in 1911, and the jersey which was worn by Dally Messenger and Dave Brown, by Clive Churchill and Arthur Beetson, by just about every New South Wales legend who ever played this sport, is still worn today. And so long as the good Lord's willing and the creek don't rise, it'll continue to be worn into the future. The game won't ever be like it once was, but it's still something. The players who head out there over the weekend are the inheritors of all that history and pride and tradition. They're the ones who keep the flame burning, because it lives in them now, as it lived in so many legends before them. ""Growing up I idolised David Peachey, adored the bloke, and this was the game he made his own, he only played one Origin but he played for Country and dominated. I have that link with him now,"" Oxley says. ""I didn't score a try, but I kicked a couple of goals. I walked away from the ground thinking 'f**k, I scored points for country' and even though we lost it put the biggest smile on my face. ""I'm a part of Country history. I'm in the scorebook with some of my heroes. It's surreal.""

5,"Despite Albanese's campaign hiccups, the election appears his to lose",analysis-and-opinion," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Liberals have used John Howard extensively during this campaign. These days, they celebrate their party hero as the great winner. He was, however, the last Liberal prime minister to take his party into the wilderness. There are comparisons and contrasts between 2007 and 2022. In each election the Coalition government was ""old"" — in 2007 it was seeking a fifth term; now it's asking for a fourth. People were ""over"" Howard, as they're ""over"" Scott Morrison. But the feeling against Howard was that he'd had his time — it's visceral against Morrison. Kevin Rudd was a fresh face, plugged into the rising issue of the times, climate change. Anthony Albanese often projects more as old Labor than future Labor. Oh, and interest rates went up by 25 basis points during each campaign — to 6.75 per cent (an 11 year high) in 2007 and to 0.35 per cent in 2022 (still at rock bottom). Despite Albanese's campaign hiccups, at the end of this penultimate week, based on the objective evidence, the election appears his to lose. The Australian newspaper's YouGov poll, which surveyed almost 19,000 people across all lower house seats between April 14 and May 7, had Labor on track to majority government. Albanese looked more relaxed than Morrison, more confident — no doubt due to every public and internal poll conducted in recent weeks — and, most importantly, scored more policy wins. This is not predictive — it's a snapshot. Both sides know the final campaign days provide risks and opportunities. A sizeable number of voters have yet to firm up their decisions. In particular, how will soft Liberal voters who are put off by Morrison break? Between those who opt to swallow hard and stick with the government and those who can't stomach the PM any longer? But to state the obvious, Morrison has a short time in which to try reduce a big margin. Last minute scare campaigns can play effectively; unexpected developments can change the dynamics. But that's only if enough voters in the right seats retain an open mind. The Liberals have left their launch, to be held in Brisbane on Sunday, until the last moment. New policy will be announced. Morrison needs to garner some momentum from it for the home run. Next week will see the release of important economic data, on unemployment and wages. The government will be hoping the unemployment figure, most recently 4 per cent, will have a three in front of it. That would be good news for the Coalition's economic pitch. The wages number could play to Labor. Wages growth was 2.3 per cent in the year to December. Any increase on that for the year to March would be expected to be small. The Reserve Bank has forecast wage growth of 2.7 per cent in the year to June, indicating it doesn't anticipate much in March. Albanese's decision yesterday to put a figure on where he'd like to see wages rise lit a fire under a debate which to date has consisted largely of empathetic generalities. If next week's figure is modest, Labor will be able to use it to highlight its case that many people are going backwards in real terms, given the 5.1 per cent inflation rate. One skill in politics is to be able to turn a negative into a neutral, or a positive, and Albanese did this in the argument over wages and inflation this week. He initially slipped up, when he embraced the desirability of the minimum hourly wage being increased by 5.1 per cent, to match inflation. The reasons he should not have been so precise have been well canvassed. But when subsequently he translated such a rise into ""two coffees a day"", the proposition would look to many voters more than reasonable (regardless of some counter economic arguments). Morrison jumped on Albanese's wages position as evidence the Opposition Leader did not understand economic matters, with the derogatory put down that ""Anthony Albanese is a loose unit on the economy."" But that meant the Prime Minister was advocating a real wage cut for the lowest paid workers. The Albanese-as-risk claim is about the best attack line the government has got, but when the debate is about wages, the government is fighting on Labor's preferred turf. If Albanese's campaign has had mistakes and glitches, Morrison's is undermined by the very obvious fact he's leading a divided party. Hardly any Liberals would have heard of Katherine Deves before she shot to prominence as Morrison's captain's pick for Warringah. Now her views on transgender issues, which the PM thinks will work for him among some ethnic voters, are causing the Liberals serious internal and external angst. In a video, former prime minister Tony Abbott, who lost Warringah to independent Zali Steggall in 2019, has urged reluctant Liberal members in the seat to get behind Deves. ""The more I see of Katherine Deves the more impressed I am with her courage, with her common sense, with her decency and with quite frankly her capacity to win this seat back for the Liberal Party,"" Abbott said. The death of shame allows politicians to play both sides of a street, as we're increasingly seeing in the matter of Katherine Deves. Voters disgruntled with Abbott's high profile campaign against marriage equality was a factor in his defeat in 2019. His words about Deves suggest he remains tone deaf to the views of many in the party and the public within his old seat. While Abbott lavishes praise on Deves, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, fighting for his political life against a teal candidate in Kooyong, was again distancing himself from Morrison's defence of her. ""I myself have been very clear in rejecting what Katherine Deves has been saying. Her comments have been insensitive, they've been inappropriate,"" he reiterated on the ABC. Morrison has said that in his ""captain's pick"" candidates for various NSW seats he was anxious to run women. A study by the Australian National University's Global Institute for Women's Leadership, released Thursday, of candidates from the major parties found only about 20 per cent of female Coalition candidates are running in safe seats. This compares with 46 per cent of male candidates. More than half (51 per cent) of Coalition women candidates are running in marginal seats — under 6 per cent — compared with 25 per cent of male candidates. Some ""80 per cent of female candidates in the Coalition are [...] running in seats they are unlikely to win, or that are precarious to hold. The equivalent proportion of men running in these seats is 54 per cent,"" the study says. If the Liberals lose this election, addressing the women problem will be among many issues confronting a shattered party. Meanwhile women present a major obstacle in Morrison's attempt to pull this election out of the fire. The female teal candidates will be attractive to women voters in those seats. More generally, Morrison is significantly more unpopular with women than with men. Women voters could be in the vanguard if May 21 delivers him a mortal blow.

6,Mark McGowan has been unbending in keeping friendly ties with China and has been rewarded with budget riches,analysis-and-opinion,"  WA Budget 2022: As WA records whopping $5.7b surplus,  our riches firmly rely on trade with China For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Throughout the deterioration in Australia's relationship with China, at least one thing has remained constant. Mark McGowan, the hugely popular West Australian Premier, has been unbending in his support for friendly ties with Beijing. As he handed down his second budget since assuming the Treasurer's portfolio in the wake of his crushing election victory last year, it was easy to see why. Almost never before has a state government posted such a whopping surplus, which is on track to be $5.7 billion for the 12 months to June 30. The only time that figure has been eclipsed was by WA itself last year, when the surplus hit $5.8 billion. It's a position that McGowan was quick to say would make any other treasurer in Australia – not least his federal counterpart Josh Frydenberg – green with envy. Such are the riches at McGowan's disposal, a $400 giveaway to every household in the state in the form of an electricity bill credit has barely made a dent in the bottom line. Throw in a couple of billion dollars' worth of debt retirement, pushing the overall amount owed to below $30 billion, and a picture of economic vitality takes seemingly clear shape. WA Premier Mark McGowan says cost of living and the health system is the focus of this year's budget. But behind the veneer is a more concerning aspect. WA, and to a significant extent Australia, has never been more reliant on China for its wealth, at the same time as relations between Canberra and Beijing plumb ever lower. For all the rhetoric around the Australian exports hit by Chinese trade strikes, such as coal, beef, wine and barley, iron ore continues to be the biggest show in town. More than $10 billion in iron ore royalties will flood into WA's coffers this financial year thanks to insatiable Chinese demand for the steel-making ingredient. To put that into context, WA's iron ore royalty receipts amounted to just $868 million in 2006-07 at a time when China was only beginning to industrialise. It's a similar story for other commodities such as oil and gas as well as gold, prices for which have been propelled skywards on the back of rocketing Chinese demand. Even WA's substantial GST receipts owe much to China, which has juiced the Australian economy and, by extension, the wallets of consumers who go out and pay the tax. Boiled down, about a quarter of WA's $37 billion budget is directly paid by China. And yet rarely, if ever, have ties between Australia and China been so fraught. Wang Yi will visit Honiara, possibly before Australia's federal election, to cement security and commercial ties with the Pacific island nation, with visits to other nations in the region likely. In the face of an increasingly confident and authoritarian Chinese leader in Xi Jinping, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has warned about geopolitics trumping trade in a new era of global uncertainty. Every other week, there appears to be a new flashpoint in the tussle for power between Beijing on the one hand and Washington – with Canberra by its side – on the other. Most recently, there have been dark mutterings about the implications of a security deal between China and the Solomon Islands in Australia's Pacific backyard. None of it is welcome for McGowan, who must know that WA's financial strength could easily turn into its biggest weakness if the big-ticket items in the trade relationship were ever truly jeopardised. He signalled as much on Thursday as he spoke to reporters in the traditional budget lock-up, saying he was ""frightened"" by the talk of war coming from some parts of the Australian Government and bureaucracy. ""I've always said we should try to have a reasonable and productive relationship with China,"" McGowan said. ""We should ensure that any diplomatic issues – and there are issues – are dealt with behind closed doors. I've said that the whole way along. ""I don't really get why the Commonwealth Defence Minister, Mr Dutton, talks about war. ""I find that sort of conversation frightening – frightening that the Commonwealth would do that. ""And I think it's grossly irresponsible to use those sorts of words and I'm not afraid to say it."" How will you benefit from the WA government's huge budget surplus? And who will miss out? Find out with our handy guide. But with very little separating Federal Labor from the Coalition on China, the WA Premier's hopes for a return to smoother ties may be in vain, regardless of which party wins next Saturday's poll. Under leader Anthony Albanese, Labor has indicated a preference for less shouty diplomacy, but just as importantly has not materially differed from the Government in most key areas. McGowan has made a virtue out of his economic management, reasonably pointing to the restraint he showed in the early days of government from 2017. But crowing about WA's world-beating financial performance also masks a more fragile reality – that without China's largesse, the west is hopelessly exposed to a single, capricious market.

7,The MP who's endured the most uncomfortable appearances with Morrison,analysis-and-opinion," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency When this election campaign is done and dusted, the PM should give the MP in his most marginal seat in Tasmania, Bridget Archer, a call to thank her for enduring the most frequent number of awkward press conferences of the campaign. Archer has had to stand by the PM and take difficult questions on his failure to act on an integrity commission and on Thursday it got worse when she stood by him at a mental health announcement. The announcement in Tasmania was important. More than $55 million will be invested into mental health and suicide prevention support and services across Tasmania over the next five years, following the signing of a bilateral agreement between the Morrison and Tasmanian Liberal governments. Mental health has been an area of priority for the Morrison government so much so that Albanese gave Scott Morrison a compliment about it at the end of the last leader's debate of the campaign. But the announcement also came in the very same week the mental health of some of the most vulnerable Australians — trans kids — were under attack again by the PM's hand-picked candidate in Warringah. The irony wasn't lost on the press pack. They asked questions of Bridget Archer — who famously crossed the floor to protect trans kids — on how she squares mental health issues with comments by Liberal candidate Katherine Deves that gender affirming surgery was akin to ""mutilation"". The Member of Bass began her answer by saying that we should be mindful that people in the LGBTQI community are around ""15 times more likely to suffer mental health challenges"". Just think about that stat. ""There are discussions that are important and can be had. I am not to say that we should not have those discussions but I have always said, and I will continue to state, is [that] when we talk about people,  whoever they are, that we should do so with kindness. That we should do so understanding that people are vulnerable and marginalised and I don't think it matters who people are we can all do better."" It comes as it was revealed that former prime minister Tony Abbott has begged Liberals in his old seat of Warringah  to ""get behind"" Deves in an attempt to stop volunteers abandoning her campaign to help Liberal campaigns elsewhere. ""The more I see of Katherine Deves the more impressed I am with her courage, with her common sense, with her decency and with quite frankly her capacity to win this seat back for the Liberal Party,"" Abbott said in a video sent to members by the Liberal Party's Warringah federal electorate conference on Thursday. Now, given the former PM actually lost the blue-ribbon seat to an independent because he was seen to be out of step with the views of his community, I'm not sure his intervention will have the consequence he would have hoped. Deves keeps causing headaches for the Liberal Party — so much so that Treasurer Josh Frydenberg distanced himself from Morrison's handling of the controversial Liberal candidate after the Prime Minister repeated his defence of the polarising candidate's views. Asked whether he would have backed Deves if he were prime minister, Frydenberg told me on ABC Radio National on Thursday morning, ""I would use different language to what the Prime Minister has used, and I've been pretty outspoken and strong in my criticism of the way Katherine Deves has approached this issue."" This is the second time that Frydenberg has told us he would use different language to the PM — last week it was about ICAC being a so-called ""kangaroo court."" As polling day gets closer and the polls show moderate seats like Kooyong could fall, the product differentiation with the PM seems to be getting more pronounced. Watch this space. NSW Treasurer Matt Kean warned of the dangers of a Trump-like shift to the right within the Liberal party, pleading with voters not to sack moderate MPs in favour of ""teal"" independents on May 21. Speaking alongside Wentworth MP Dave Sharma, Kean warned that unseating moderate Liberals would leave the party lacking important perspectives, drawing parallels to the Republican party in the US. Morrison really doubled down on his claim that Anthony Albanese's position on a rise to the minimum wage could cause an economic chain reaction. ""[If] you're loose with things and run off at the mouth about where you think wages should or should not be, that can precondition inflationary expectations in the economy, and it can actually become a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Morrison said in Launceston. The PM said he wants to see wage rises but he doesn't want to see ""reckless behaviour in how the process should work, and this is where Mr Albanese has failed"". The debate over the extent to which wages should grow has dominated the final key days of the campaign but it's still not clear how Albanese can lack a ""magic pen"" on wages AND be about to cause a Diana Ross style ""chain reaction"" in the economy. Albanese says he has been ""consistent"" on the wages policy but Labor continues not to reveal if this 5.1 per cent rate would be in a post-election submission by a Labor government to the Fair Work Commission. Albanese did arrive in Gladstone where he was making another announcement with a gold coin he held up to demonstrate his political point that the wage rise he is advocating for minimum wage earners is modest. Morrison also came under pressure on his claim a $500,000 compensation payment negotiated for a former staffer doesn't involve claims against his stood-aside education minister Alan Tudge.He has previously said he ""would have been told"" if the negotiations of a payment to former staffer Rachelle Miller involved a cabinet minister. News.com.au has reported on Thursday that the negotiations mentioned the stood-aside education minister Alan Tudge and Attorney-General Michaelia Cash.

8,Aussies teams face crunch time as Super Rugby Pacific finals loom on horizon,analysis-and-opinion," Sport Australian teams face crunch time as Super Rugby Pacific finals loom on horizon For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Super Rugby Pacific is building nicely towards its crescendo, and all five Australian sides are still well and truly in the hunt for a play-off berth with three rounds of the competition to play. In the case of the Brumbies, the Waratahs and the Reds, the stakes remain high with all three eyeing off top-four finishes. The Brumbies sit second on the table and could even finish the home-and-away rounds as minor premiers. The eight-team finals format was criticised when first announced, with two thirds of the competition being eligible, but with no positions decided with three games to go there is no question the anticipation and intrigue around the run to the play-offs has built as the season has played out. There are a host of games in each round to play — at least four in this weekend's round 13 — that will impact positions on the table as the finals near, and it is possible at this stage that both the top four and the broader top eight will not be decided until the final round in a fortnight. With the much-improved showing from the Australian sides against New Zealand opposition in 2022, it feels like the competition has taken on new life in the back half of the season. The top two could be decided over the next two games, with the Brumbies hosting the third-placed Crusaders and first-placed Blues on consecutive weekends at Canberra Stadium. There is a feeling Friday night's clash against the Crusaders might be the biggest game in Canberra since the 2020 Super Rugby AU final, with strong throwback themes to the glory days of the early 2000s when the the two sides seemed to face off in finals and semi-finals annually. Pies and buckets of chips have been slashed back to 2004 prices for the game, a nod to the year the sides played out an epic final on front of a then-record Canberra Stadium crowd. Roadside ""Vote 1 Brumby Jack"" corflutes are certainly standing out amid an election campaign that people can't wait to see end. ""There's no harder task than going up against the Crusaders, so we can't get carried away with ourselves,"" Brumbies prop James Slipper said in Canberra this week. Slipper will play his 50th match for the Brumbies this week, after relocating from Queensland at the start of the 2019 season. Having chalked up 150 Super Rugby games only recently, he knows enough about the Crusaders from his days at the Reds. ""They're a team that really crucify you if you make mistakes,"" Slipper said. ""Limiting their opportunities is going to be key for us, and that's us executing under pressure and taking big moments in the game, because those opportunities will come. It's up to us whether we want to take them or not. ""We're just going to have to be big in the collision area and at [the] set-piece."" That has certainly been true of late, with the Brumbies' set-piece being their literal foundation to play from since losing to the Reds back in round eight. Brumbies skipper Allan Ala'alatoa is back after missing a few games, but the scrum has remained strong without him. Their line-out drive has returned to its most lethal routes with five rolling-maul tries in the last four games. Their depth and rotations will be tested however, with Noah Lolesio and Rob Valetini both ruled out this week. The Waratahs, fifth on the table, have a similar record to the fourth-placed Chiefs. They knocked off the Crusaders before beating Moana Pasifika in Auckland last weekend and are growing in confidence. Saturday night's match-up with the Hurricanes is a mouth-watering one and hopes of another massive home crowd on the Leichhardt Oval hill await. The Waratahs have the Highlanders and Blues to follow and are very much eyeing off a top-four finish with the view that hosting a quarter-final at home gives them a definite edge. ""I think it's critical to our season,"" Wallabies and New South Wales prop Angus Bell said this week. ""We said a few weeks ago we were looking down the ladder this year but now we're looking up. We want to see how far we can go and how deep we can get into this competition. ""We think that getting a home final at Leichhardt or somewhere in Sydney would give us the best opportunity to do that. ""We're really pushing hard for that top-four spot and we're really looking forward to the challenges ahead."" It's much the same story in Queensland, where the Reds are desperate to turn around three straight losses since the start of the trans-Tasman section of the competition. They are still only one point off the Chiefs after their strong start to the season. A home final is still in their crosshairs. Playing the table-topping Blues in Eden Park in Auckland looms as about as big a challenge as there is in Super Rugby Pacific this season, but having Wallabies fly-half James O'Connor back in the Queensland number 10 jersey will certainly help. ""We haven't won there for 10 years,"" Reds captain Tate McDermott said in Brisbane. ""It's a really good opportunity. We've got a three-week block here leading into the finals, which we will be a part of, but for us it's about where we want to play that play-off match, really. ""It doesn't get any easier. We've had to get back on the horse after the result on the weekend, so there's fair bit of motivation for us for this game."" All the Australian sides — the Western Force and Melbourne Rebels included — can have a positive impact on their ladder positions this weekend. And if that's not enough to push fans along to the rugby this weekend, Slipper hopes the lure of canteen bargains might be enough. ""The Brumbies faithful really get behind us and we feel everything they give us, so if we can get as many out there as possible, to get some cheap pies and chips in, I'll join them after the game and tuck in as well,"" he said.

9,Western Australia is flush with cash but it's not all smooth sailing for the state budget,analysis-and-opinion,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Western Australia is overflowing with cash, but despite the multi-billion-dollar surpluses it's not all smooth sailing for Mark McGowan as he prepares to hand down his second budget as Treasurer. Over the last few weeks, he's been proudly telling West Australians they've achieved the COVID ""soft landing"" he's been speaking about for months. Today's budget was meant to be the next part of that – another huge surplus, buoyed in part by strong iron ore prices and the dividends of the state's GST deal. Together with the government's management of the state's finances, it leaves little need for tough measures like cuts or cost hikes. On the government's initial modelling, the COVID peak was meant to have well and truly passed, delivering a near fairytale ending to the pandemic as West Australians embraced living with COVID and case numbers slowly trended downwards. But instead, the Treasurer is handing down the budget as the state endures a soaring second wave, pushing an already teetering health system to the brink, and taking growing numbers of West Australians out of the workforce when they need their paycheques more than ever. The significant surplus will at least soften those blows a little, but still leaves the Premier with one big question: how to spend the billions overflowing from government coffers. Despite daily case numbers now close to double what they were at the state's last peak, many are getting on with living with the virus. High booster rates mean testing positive is nowhere near as bad as it would have been for most, and many workplaces are adapting to the number of people stuck at home. But hospitals and ambulances are not workplaces that can function without sufficient staff on the ground. For years the health system has been struggling to keep up, but now it seems to have reached breaking point. Monday's warning ambulances could be delayed reaching patients was the latest unprecedented height of the crisis – highlighting both the lack of beds to treat patients in and the pressure rising COVID cases are adding to the system. The government has already announced some of what the budget will bring in this area, including $252 million worth of changes to emergency care and $30.1 million (that was promised at the election) for more regional ambulances and paramedics. But the only additional capacity to be announced in Perth is 10 new beds in Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital's intensive care unit. More are on the way before the end of the year, having been funded previously, but even with last year's record surplus, the issue couldn't be resolved. Healthcare staff say they need even more beds and staff, but with an overheated construction sector and global demand for doctors and nurses, neither will arrive soon. ""Real-time"" modelling of WA's Omicron outbreak finds about half a million more people will be infected and deaths will double by the end of June. The Premier has been quick to point out WA's health system is the best funded per capita of all the states, but it seems that still isn't enough. There will be many who hope the past few weeks have delivered a wake-up call to the need for even greater long-term investment. While WA's coffers are overflowing, the battle with rising cost of living has far surpassed COVID as the major worry for most West Australians. For some, it surely will be made worse by a COVID diagnosis leaving them unable to work for a week or more at a time when inflation means their income is stretching less and less. Inflation isn't an issue affecting just West Australians, but the state is copping it worse than many other places around the country. Perth alone saw the greatest jump in inflation over the last year of anywhere in the country – 7.6 per cent, compared to 5.1 per cent nationally. An electricity credit, similar to what the government gave West Australians in 2020 is expected to be one of the measures in this year's budget. Last time it cost taxpayers $600 million and it's likely to be less this year with households receiving a smaller credit. Many West Australians would rightly expect more than that given the money the government has to throw around. The other obvious place to put this year's surplus is into paying down state debt. ""There will never be a better opportunity for any state government, now or in the future, to pay down debt,"" shadow treasurer Steve Thomas said. ""No government will have the level of surpluses that this government has."" Mr McGowan was yesterday keen to make the point he didn't have to choose in this budget between measures to ease cost of living pressures and paying down debt. ""The good thing about my government and Western Australians is we've managed the finances responsibly over our five years in office, which gives us the capacity to do things like that, at the same time we are paying down debt,"" he said. Of course, there's myriad other projects and causes that deserve, and would love to receive, extra funding, and social housing is just one of them. Thanks to pressures on the housing and construction sectors, the number of social homes in WA has barely grown over the last year. Those working in the space want to see more money put aside to buy houses for those who need them, with 18,837 applications on the waitlist at the end of April. It can't be forgotten this all comes just over a week out from a federal election, where Labor is attempting to paint itself as a party of good financial management. ""WA has been incredibly successful over the last few years,"" Mr McGowan was keen to remind the Labor faithful at the party's national campaign launch. ""Some of the best economic, health and social outcomes in the entire world. The lowest unemployment rate of all the states, the strongest set of finances, the only government in Australia in surplus and the only government paying down debt. ""We know that it is Labor governments that best manage our economy and responsibly manage our finances."" The efforts of the Premier, and his government, have certainly been a key part of the reason why WA is in the position it is. It's a fact that certainly won't hurt his party's argument on the national stage. But what may matter most for West Australians is just how much of that success can be put towards making a real difference in their lives.

10,Ange Postecoglou silences critics the only way he knows how — by winning,analysis-and-opinion," Sport Ange Postecoglou silences doubters with superb debut season in Europe, claiming Scottish Premiership with Celtic For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency We shouldn't have been surprised. In fact, plenty of Australian football fans will say they foresaw this success for Ange Postecoglou, even if the rest of the footballing world barely disguised their lack of faith. And yet, Postecoglou has silenced those European sceptics to lead Celtic to a thoroughly deserved Scottish Premiership title at the first time of asking, clinching the title with a 1-1 draw away to Dundee United. Twelve months ago even the hardiest of Celtic fans would have had a hard time believing this was possible. Celtic were at a low ebb, without a manager and facing a resurgent Rangers that had comprehensively ended their tilt at a tenth successive title, beating Celtic into second by 25 points. Bitter rivals Rangers, under Steven Gerrard, won that year's Premiership with a whopping six games to go — the earliest a side has ever won the league. It was the first season since 2009/10 that Celtic had failed to win a trophy. Players were leaving, the fans were off side and their biggest rivals were on the up: hardly a good time for an enigmatic and underrated coach from Australia to take charge of one of Europe's biggest clubs, one would think. And yet for Postecoglou, perhaps it was. After all, his style demands total buy in, a sea change in belief and style that can only come when a club is, perhaps open to change. That's what happened in Brisbane with the Roar, which required a wholesale clear out of some of Australian football's biggest names to create a team nicknamed Roarcelona such was their attractive style of play. It happened with Australia too, after the Socceroos had been hammered 6-0 by both Brazil and France in successive matches prior to him taking charge. He led the Socceroos to Asian Cup success in 2015 and World Cup qualification in 2018. It was also the case at Yokahama with an F.Marinos side that had not won a title in 15 years prior to being blessed by the presence of Postecoglou. In Japan, Postecolgou was given time, finishing 12th in his first season before his methods and philosophy permeated through a near-impregnable language barrier to create the free-flowing style that earned them the J-League title the following year. At Celtic, time is not a luxury afforded to anyone. ""This isn't a club that should go years without any trophies,"" Postecoglou told the BBC after winning this year's League Cup with Celtic, ending a brief trophy drought. ""My first task when I took the role was to give the fans hope. ""I couldn't guarantee success, but I could give them hope."" He couldn't guarantee success, but he sure has delivered it, overhauling a cavernous points deficit to Rangers from the previous year to fly past and win with a game to spare. Managing Celtic was a challenge unlike anything Postecoglou had ever faced in his extensive, 26-year managerial career to date. Such is the relative strength of Glasgow's Old Firm, matches between the pair are what count, with the rest of the 12-team league expected to be swatted aside with ease. Every club hopes for success. Few demand it. Rangers and Celtic, the two enormous fish in the ever-shrinking Scottish Premiership pond, are expected to win the title every year — Celtic have not finished any lower than second in the league in 27 years. In Old Firm matches this season, honours have been even: Five games in league and cup, two wins apiece and a draw the result. It's in the matches that Celtic have been expected to win that they have bettered Rangers, who struggled in January and February having lost manager Gerrard in November. That's not always been the case with Postecoglou teams due to his adherence to a set style of play with a view to continually develop, rather than eke out wins by any means necessary. That philosophical rigidity only impacted Celtic at the start of the year, when Celtic took just two wins and a draw from eight matches to sit sixth on the ladder. The doubters sharpened their pitchforks, but the squad, bolstered by 14 new signings, were starting to gel and the free-flowing style for which Postecoglou has become synonymous was proving far too much for Scotland's lesser lights. Those new signings have also proved to be a masterstroke by Postecoglou. Six Celtic players were named in the Professional Footballers Association SPL team of the year. Four of them: Cameron Carters-Vickers, Josip Juranović, Jota and Kyogo Furuhashi, were signed by Postecoglou. Kyogo is the most interesting of those signings given he is one of four J-League players that followed Postecoglou from Japan to Europe — moves that raised eyebrows when they were announced. Postecoglou was greeted with heaps of scorn from the British press who cared little about his impressive record in leagues outside the limelight. Former Scotland striker Alan Brazil became something of the face of Scottish football's ignorance with his now infamous TalkSport segment. Rangers legend Ally McCoist, who laughed along with Brazil as he incredulously asked whether Postecoglou's naming as Celtic boss was a ""wind up"", has since eaten his words. ""He's done a great job there and has continued to do a great job,"" the Rangers legend told Sky Sports after Celtic's League Cup win earlier this year. But success at Celtic does not mean winning one Premiership, not by a long shot. If he wants become a legend at Parkhead, he'll need to win next year too. And the year after. And the year after that, with a smattering of cup successes and lengthy European Cup runs thrown in for good measure. Getting on top is almost the easy part of life at one of the Old Firm. Staying there is something else entirely. However, now he's shown his tactical wares in the crucible of Scottish football, Postecoglou will be a marked man for those who lead the big clubs south of the border. There is little doubt that the first managerial casualty of the 2022/23 Premier League season will lead to calls for Postecoglou's style to be blooded in England, particularly if he can lead Celtic deep in the Champions League, as big an ask as that is for a team with a fraction of the budget of the erstwhile Super League wannabes. That will be a different, bigger test again, particularly with financial inequality making measures of success so varied across the league. Would it be unwise to jump straight into that shark pit, as Gerrard has done with Aston Villa and former Celtic man Brendan Rodgers did at Leicester? Perhaps, but there is little doubt that if Postecoglou does opt to go down that route, or is at least given the chance, he will succeed. Because that's what he does and what he continues to do, everywhere he goes.
