0,"Chinese spy ship detected off Western Australia, near secretive naval facility, Dutton says ",world," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A high-tech Chinese surveillance ship has been tracked off the West Australian coast, close to a secretive naval communications base that supports American and other allied submarines. Defence Minister Peter Dutton has revealed the auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) vessel was closely monitored by the ADF as it sailed past the Harold E Holt naval station at Exmouth. Mr Dutton said Australia had been tracking the spy ship in the past ""week or so"" but didn't put an exact date on the surveillance. ""Its intent, of course, is to collect intelligence right along the coastline,"" he said. ""It has been in close proximity to military and intelligence installations on the west coast of Australia."" The Defence Minister, who described the situation as unprecedented, said he was concerned not just at how far south the ship had travelled but also that it had ""hugged"" the coastline as it headed back north towards Darwin. He dubbed the matter ""very strange"" and said he expected the ship was collecting as much intelligence as it could. Shadow Defence Minister Brendan O'Connor said Labor ""shares concerns"" that the Chinese are conducting surveillance operations off Australia's west coast. ""We note a concerning pattern of behaviour from the PLA Navy of intelligence ships entering Australia economic exclusive zone,"" Mr O'Connor said in a statement. Mr O'Connor added that he had a preliminary conversation with Mr Dutton and has sought ""a more comprehensive briefing"". Mr Dutton denied that he was making the revelation to stoke national security fears and to woo votes ahead of the May 21 federal election. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ship's proximity to Australia was a reminder of the geo-strategic reality. ""They'll keep a close eye on us and I can assure you, Australia, in our national interest, will always be keeping a close eye on them,"" Mr Morrison said. The Prime Minister did not repeat Mr Dutton's claim this was an act of aggression. ""I certainly don't believe that when you take it together with the many coercive acts and the many statements that have been made attacking Australia's nation interest, you could describe it as an act of bridge-building or friendship,"" Mr Morrison said. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Scott Morrison accused a Chinese warship of a ""reckless and irresponsible act"" after a laser was shone at an RAAF aircraft as it approached Australia's northern shoreline. Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews has suggested the ship's journey may have been deliberately timed to coincide with the election campaign. ""I think you have always got to question what the timing is,"" Ms Andrews said. ""We all understand that China is very strategic and is very careful about what it does, when it does it, and how it does it."" When asked if he had travelled to Western Australia to make the announcement, Mr Dutton declined to say, citing ""operational reasons"". ""I think people understand the difficulty, the reality, of the Indo-Pacific at the moment, the acts of aggression from the Chinese leadership and from the Chinese government,"" he said. ""I think Australians deserve to know what is taking place and it is a repeat of a previous practice where we have made the public aware of these activities before."" The ABC last year revealed the Defence Department had scrapped a contentious proposal to use private security personnel to guard Harold E Holt Naval Communications Station, one of the nation's most secretive and important military facilities.

1,'Moles in the dark': Survival and escape from the Mariupol steelworks,world,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Five storeys below the besieged Azovstal steelworks, Ukrainian soldiers told Nataliya Babeush she had a few minutes to prepare to escape the underground bunker she called home for more than two months. The 35-year-old grabbed little more than a handful of children's drawings: some sketches of flowers and food that had helped to cheer dozens of civilians who had sheltered for weeks in one corner of the vast, dimly lit concrete warren. ""I'll keep them as long as I can,"" she told Reuters, speaking after a humanitarian convoy brought her on Sunday to the city of Zaporizhzhia in south-east Ukraine. Ms Babeush and hundreds of others had sought refuge in the enormous complex beneath the Azovstal plant soon after Russia invaded Ukraine in the early hours of February 24 and laid siege to the port city of Mariupol. She saw the plant as a short-term shelter before a retreat to safety elsewhere. Instead, the refuge became a trap as Azovstal became the focus of the fiercest fighting in the war. Reuters spoke to four evacuees from the plant who spent weeks underground in dark, dank conditions enduring bombardment in one of the steelworks' numerous bunkers. They described how the group of strangers was bonded by a need to survive, to ration food and keep their spirits up, as Russian forces drew closer. ""Every second was hellish. It's very scary underground — to be underground like moles in the dark,"" said 51-year-old nurse Valentyna Demyanchuk. Russia has strongly denied targeting civilians in the conflict, which it calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise Ukraine. Authorities in Kyiv say thousands of civilians have been killed in Mariupol and has accused Moscow of war crimes. Russia's defence ministry and Ukraine's government did not respond to a request for comment on the women's testimony. All four women described being woken up before dawn on the first day of the war by the bombardment of Mariupol. Accountant Larisa Solop, 49, fled her apartment in the east of the city when fighting drew near. She hoped to meet her daughter's family on the other side of town but there was no cell phone reception. ""Lots of buildings were burning… and shells whistled overhead,"" she said. As an evening curfew neared, she realised her only hope was to shelter in nearby Azovstal — ""just a stop-over."" Two months later, she would be one of the last civilians to be evacuated on May 6 from the plant by the United Nations and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Most of the roughly 40 people sharing Ms Solop's shelter arrived in early March. Many had just the clothes on their backs, others brought a few belongings and a bag or two of canned goods, pasta, porridge or potatoes, the women said. Ms Babeush, a former plant worker, became the main cook, stirring pots of soup on a wood-burning stove in the concrete storey above their bunker. ""The kids called her Auntie Soup,"" said Ms Demyanchuk, laughing ruefully. The group ate one meal a day, she said. A strike knocked out all power supplies in early March, after which the group was plunged into darkness. They started rationing candles, while some of the men fashioned little torches from banks of industrial lighting that could run on individual batteries. As the bombing intensified, some people attempted to leave but didn't reach the perimeter of the complex before returning to the shelter, the women said. ""Planes from the sea were bombing so much that we couldn't even get outside,"" said Ms Solop, recalling her elderly father being knocked off his feet in the bunker by the force of a blast. As a distraction, Ms Babeush encouraged the eight children in the group to decorate workers' helmets. She made a robot costume out of a box with holes cut out of for eyes and organised a drawing competition at Orthodox Easter. Everyone voted and the first prize was a tin of meat paste. Her favourite drawing was of a pizza with lovingly detailed strings of melted cheese. But privately, Ms Babeush had given up hope. She wrote her parents' phone numbers inside her jacket in case she died in the bunker. ""I didn't think we'd get out."" Ms Demyanchuk, her husband, son and elderly mother were among the first to make a break for it. Weary of the shelling, they decided to try their luck on foot on March 26 even though her mother needed two walking sticks and had to be carried part of the way. ""The food was running out and we were tired of sitting underground,"" Ms Demyanchuk said by phone from central Ukraine in early May. As Russian forces step up their assault on Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks, video has emerged which appears to show some of the women and children trapped inside. Ms Demyanchuk said the soldiers made her wait for when the skies appeared clearer and urged them to move as fast as possible. They did not try to stop her leaving. Their journey to Ukraine-controlled territory lasted several days. As bombers flew overhead, they walked past buildings with fresh graves dug in the yard and saw the charred body of a soldier on the seafront, she said. But, being outside the bunker, she said she felt ""an indescribable feeling of freedom."" The other three women had more than a month to wait before hearing via their one crackly radio of international efforts to evacuate civilians from the plant. ""It gave us a bit of strength that soon, in just a little bit more time, we would get out of there,"" said 25-year-old Tetyana Trotsak, whose asthmatic mother was suffering in the damp air. After a local ceasefire was brokered, evacuation began in early May. But it was a bittersweet moment for those in the bunker — the group would only be allowed to leave in stages. ""The hardest part was waiting and hoping we'd get out. It was a kind of despair,"" said Ms Solop. Food was running dangerously low, even with extra rations shared by the Ukrainian forces who were holed up in another part of the plant that had become their last redoubt after Russian troops seized control of Mariupol. Eleven people, including families with children and people with health problems, went first, clambering out of the bunker and weaving their way through rubble to get to a convoy of buses. ""We were so happy for them, but we stayed there and thought what if they've taken this group and are not able to do more?,"" said Ms Solop. A couple of days later, the soldiers told Ms Babeush and others they had five minutes to get ready. They were told they had to hurry to make it to the buses or the final group in the bunker might miss the chance to evacuate that day. Ms Babeush grabbed little more than some of the drawings that had been taped up around the shelter. ""The war has taught me you don't need material things. For life, you don't need anything — just people you can rely on,"" she said.

2,Elon Musk's Twitter deal 'temporarily on hold',world,"  Elon Musk places $61.4 billion deal for Twitter on hold over details on fake accounts For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Elon Musk said Friday that his planned $US44 billion ($61.4 billion) purchase of Twitter is ""temporarily on hold"" pending details about spam and fake accounts on the social media platform. In a tweet, the Tesla billionaire linked to a Reuters story from May 2 citing a financial filing from Twitter that estimated false or spam accounts made up fewer than five per cent of the company's daily active users — totalling 229 million users — in the first quarter. ""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,"" Mr Musk wrote. The move indicates Mr Musk is skeptical that the number of unauthentic accounts is that low and is the latest twist amid signs of internal turmoil over the acquisition. It wasn't clear whether the issue could scuttle the deal. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr Musk's representatives or his company, Tesla Inc, were not immediately available for a comment. Stock in both Twitter and Tesla swung sharply in opposite directions, with Twitter's stock tumbling 18 per cent, and Tesla, which Mr Musk had proposed using to help fund the Twitter deal, jumped 5 per cent. Investors have had to weigh legal troubles for Mr Musk, as well as the possibility that acquiring Twitter could be a distraction from running the world's most valuable automaker. Elon Musk's brilliant track record has seen even the most blue-blooded establishment figures overlook his more outlandish and erratic behaviour. But this time, even his most ardent supporters have their doubts, writes Ian Verrender. Mr Musk, the world's richest man and a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, had said that one of his priorities would be to remove ""spam bots"" from the platform. Mr Musk has previously been critical of Twitter's moderation policy. He has said he wants Twitter's algorithm to prioritise tweets to be public and was against too much power on the service to corporations that advertise. Twitter said it faced several risks until the deal with Mr Musk is closed, including whether advertisers would continue to spend on Twitter amid ""potential uncertainty regarding future plans and strategy."" Earlier this week, he said he would reverse Twitter's ban on former US President Donald Trump when he buys the social media platform, signalling his intention to cut moderation of the site. The implied probability of the deal closing at the agreed price fell below 50 per cent for the first time on Tuesday, when Twitter shares dropped below $46.75. He's a space rocket mogul, an electric car salesman, a madcap inventor, and a celebrity entrepreneur. Who is Elon Musk, and how did he become the richest person in the world? Musk's tweet comes a day after the social media company fired two of its top managers. Twitter said the company is pausing most hiring, except for critical roles, and is ""pulling back on non-labour costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient."" In a memo sent to employees and confirmed by Twitter, chief executive Parag Agrawal said the company has not hit growth and revenue milestones after the company began to invest ""aggressively"" to expand its user base and revenue.

3,Marcos allies seize control of Philippines Congress after landslide election victory,world,"  Ferdinand Marcos Jr allies seize control of Philippines Congress after election victory For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Allies of the presumptive next president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, appear set to dominate both chambers of Congress after the late dictator son's apparent election victory restored his family to the seat of power. Ongoing counts from Monday's vote show they're set to capture most of the 300-seat House of Representatives and half of the 24-seat Senate that was up for election, and likely their top leaderships. Their family members and siblings have been also proclaimed winners in local posts, reflecting the strong grip of political dynasties on the South East Asian democracy despite a constitutional prohibition that was never enforced. ""It's going to be problematic because an opposition is very much needed in a democracy,"" said Jean Franco, a political science professor at the state-run University of the Philippines. ""There has to be alternative ideas and there has to be monitoring of what the executive is doing, otherwise, we will be like North Korea."" The electoral triumph of Mr Marcos Jr and his allies is an astonishing reversal of the army-backed but largely peaceful ""People Power"" revolt in 1986 that forced his father out of office following years of massive human rights atrocities and plunder that his son never acknowledged. Mr Marcos Jr had more than 31 million votes in the unofficial count in what's projected to be one of the strongest majority mandates for a Philippine president in decades. His vice-presidential running mate and daughter of the outgoing populist leader, Sara Duterte, appeared to have also won with a massive margin. US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping were among the world leaders who have congratulated them on their huge victory and the relatively smooth conduct of the elections. The separately elected president and vice president are set to take office on June 30 for a single, six-year term after Congress confirms the results. ""It's like a storm surge, a tsunami in Congress for the opposition,"" left-wing House Representative Carlos Zarate, whose nine-year term ends in June, told The Associated Press. ""The challenge for the broad opposition is not to concede but to press the fight for good governance, accountability and democracy wherever it takes."" This is what the Filipino community in Australia are saying about their future. The small fraction of a left-wing opposition bloc would likely be trimmed further in the incoming Congress largely due to a military campaign to link it to communist guerrillas, Mr Zarate said. Hundreds of students and anti-Marcos activists protested alleged election fraud, including the breakdown of many voting machines, but riot troops blocked them from getting close to a main vote-counting centre in metropolitan Manila. Vice President Leni Robredo, a human rights lawyer who has not conceded defeat as Mr Marcos Jr's closest challenger, was expected to lead a thanksgiving rally later on Friday with her followers. Representative Ferdinand Martin Romualdez, a cousin of Marcos Jr, has been endorsed as House speaker by his party. Another possible candidate is Mr Romualdez's ally and former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who brokered the alliance of Mr Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte. Only one opposition candidate, Senator Risa Hontiveros, would likely make it to the new slate in the Senate. Aside from deciding the fate of the president's legislative agenda and budget proposal, Congress is a crucial oversight that investigates major government anomalies and decides on impeachment complaints. A new anti-terror bill opposed by human rights groups, for example, easily passed in both chambers that were dominated by allies of President Rodrigo Duterte. Court cases and legal issues still hound the late dictator's family, including payment of a huge estate tax, a 2018 corruption conviction of his widow, Imelda Marcos, which is on appeal, and full compensation of thousands of victims of torture, detentions, disappearances and other atrocities committed in the martial-law era when he was in power. A brutal anti-drug crackdown launched by Mr Duterte, which killed thousands of mostly petty drug suspects, has sparked an investigation by the International Criminal Court as potential crimes against humanity. The outgoing leader, who is known for his brash language, has said he would likely face more criminal complaints when he steps down on June 30. Thirty-six years after his corrupt father was ousted, Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr looks set to step into the role of Philippines president. Monday's elections assured the political longevity of both the Marcoses and the Dutertes. A son of the presumptive president, Sandro Marcos, was elected to the House as a representative of their northern home province of Ilocos Norte and several relatives captured provincial posts. Sara Duterte's brother, Sebastian Duterte, would succeed her as mayor of southern Davao city. Another brother, Paulo Duterte, has been re-elected to another congressional term. Philippine elections have long been dominated by politicians belonging to the same bloodlines. At least 250 political families have monopolised power across the country, although such dynasties are prohibited under the constitution. Congress — long controlled by members of powerful clans targeted by the constitutional ban — has failed to pass the law needed to define and enforce the provision. Mr Duterte, the outgoing president, carved a political name starting in the 1980s as a longtime Davao mayor with his extra-tough campaign against criminality. It left hundreds of drug suspects dead and presaged similar killings on a wider scale that would follow him when he rose to the presidency in 2016 on an audacious but failed campaign promise to eradicate illegal drugs and corruption in three to six months.

4,Accused Russian soldier faces court in first Ukraine war crime trial ,world,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A Russian soldier has gone on trial in Ukraine for the killing of an unarmed civilian, marking the first time a member of the Russian military has been prosecuted for a war crime during the 11-week conflict. A 21-year-old captured member of a tank unit is accused of shooting a 62-year-old Ukrainian man in the head through an open car window in the north-eastern village of Chupakhivka during the war's first week. Scores of journalists and cameras packed inside a small courtroom at the Solomyanskyy district court in Kyiv, where the suspect, Vadim Shyshimarin, appeared in a small glass cage wearing a blue and grey outfit. He faces up to life in prison under the penalties spelled out in the section of the Ukrainian criminal code that addresses the laws and customs of war. Ukraine's top prosecutor is investigating allegations that Russian troops violated Ukrainian and international law by killing, torturing and abusing possibly thousands of Ukrainian civilians. The judges and lawyers in Mr Shyshimarin's case discussed procedural matters briefly before the judges left the courtroom and then returned to say the proceedings would continue on another day. Defence lawyer Victor Ovsyanikov acknowledged that the case against the soldier was strong but said the final decision over what evidence to allow would be made by the court in Kyiv. Mr Ovsyanikov said on Thursday that he and his client had not yet decided how he will plead. US President Joe Biden has called for the prosecution of Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes after the discovery in Bucha, Ukraine, of mass graves and bodies of bound civilians shot at close range, but various challenges stand in the way. As the inaugural war-crimes case in Ukraine, Mr Shyshimarin's prosecution is being watched closely. Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova's office has said it is looking into more than 10,700 potential war crimes involving more than 600 suspects, including Russian soldiers and government officials. Many of the alleged atrocities came to light last month after Moscow's forces ended their bid to capture Kyiv and withdrew from around the capital, exposing mass graves and streets and yards strewn with bodies in towns such as Bucha. Volodymyr Yavorskyy, coordinator at the Center for Civil Liberties in Kyiv, one of Ukraine's largest human rights groups, said activists will monitor the Russian soldier's trial to ensure that his legal rights are protected. It can be difficult, he said, to maintain the neutrality of court proceedings during wartime. The observance of the trial's rules and norms ""will determine how similar cases will be handled in the future,"" Mr Yavorskyy said. Vadim Karasev, an independent Kyiv-based political analyst, said it's important for Ukrainian authorities ""to demonstrate that the war crimes will be solved and those responsible will be brought to justice in line with international standards"". Over the past week, Ms Venediktova, her office and the Security Service of Ukraine, the country's law enforcement agency, have posted a few details from the investigation into Mr Shyshimarin's actions on their social media accounts. On February 28, four days after Russia invaded Ukraine, Mr Shyshimarin was among a group of Russian troops that had been defeated by Ukrainian forces, according to Ms Venediktova's account. The ABC has gathered accounts of potential war crimes against civilians in the village of Berestyanka, including rapes, shootings and an execution. Warning: This article contains images and details readers might find distressing. As the Russians fled, they fired at a private car and seized the vehicle. They then drove to Chupakhivka, a village in the Sumy region about 322km east of Kyiv. On the way, Ms Venediktova said, the Russian soldiers saw a man walking on the sidewalk and talking on his phone. Mr Shyshimarin was ordered to kill the man so he wouldn't be able to report them to Ukrainian military authorities. She does not identify who gave the order. Mr Shyshimarin fired his Kalashnikov rifle through the open window and hit the victim in the head. ""The man died on the spot just a few dozen meters from his house,"" Ms Venediktova wrote. The Security Service of Ukraine, known as the SBU, posted a short video on May 4 of Mr Shyshimarin speaking in front of a camera and briefly describing how he shot the man. The SBU described the video as ""one of the first confessions of the enemy invaders"". ""I was ordered to shoot,"" said Mr Shyshimarin, wearing a blue and grey hooded sweatshirt. ""I shot one (round) at him. He falls. And we kept on going.""

5,"Residents queue at supermarkets for essentials, as Beijing denies it's heading for lockdown",world,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Beijing has denied it is heading for COVID-19 lockdown as panic buying grips the Chinese capital, while in Shanghai, officials have combed the city for lingering cases in the hope of clearing the way to escape from weeks of painful restrictions. Daily cases in Beijing have remained in the dozens, a tiny fraction of the outbreak in Shanghai and what other cities around the world now shrug off as they look to ""live with the virus"". But with gradually tightening curbs in China's capital — most recently suspending taxi services in some virus-hit districts — rumours swirled on Thursday (local time) that it was headed for lockdown, something Beijing has avoided during the entire pandemic. There were chaotic scenes inside some supermarkets late on Thursday as residents rushed to stock up on supplies while anxiously listening to Beijing's daily COVID news conference on their phones. Grace Zhao stood in a 50-metre queue outside one supermarket in Chaoyang, Beijing's most populous district and the epicentre of its current outbreak. ""This is quite unhealthy because people are in a very nervous mood,"" she said. Restaurants are the latest to be banned from opening as Beijing continues to tighten its COVID-19 restrictions, with schools already closing and negative tests required for public transport. Authorities there have already banned dine-in services at restaurants, closed some malls, entertainment and tourist venues, suspended sections of its bus and subway systems and imposed lockdowns on some residential buildings. Officials at the news conference denied rumours of a lockdown and told people not to panic-buy, but also encouraged residents to stay home and said they would launch a new round of mass testing across most of the city. China also said on Thursday it would ""strictly limit"" unnecessary travel outside the country by Chinese citizens. Most international flights in and out of China have been cancelled during the past two years. Shanghai — the commercial hub of 25 million people that has been battling a far larger outbreak and endured weeks of lockdown — has in recent days been tightening curbs in a push to eradicate the virus by the end of the month after making significant recent progress, according to data this week. Shanghai's mass testing detected just two new cases outside areas facing the strictest curbs on May 11, officials said on Thursday, after finding none the previous day. Authorities in China's largest city have again tightened anti-virus restrictions, just as it was emerging from a month of strict lockdown due to a COVID-19 outbreak. Significantly, the cases were found in two of the city's 16 districts, Xuhui and Fengxian, that authorities said this week were among eight that had achieved ""zero COVID"" status, having had no community cases for three consecutive days. The latest cases show the difficulty in finishing off the highly transmissible Omicron variant despite ruthless enforcement of some of China's harshest restrictions since the virus emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019. The new infections also raise concern about how long a return to normal life might last under China's uncompromising ""zero COVID"" policy after the lockdown is finally lifted. Yu Linwei, vice-governor of Xuhui, told a news conference his district would not relax anti-epidemic efforts, making sure everyone was tested and that new cases and their close contacts were isolated in quarantine as quickly as possible. ""We dare not slack off,"" he said. Overall, Shanghai reported more than 1,000 new cases, but they were in areas already under the tightest controls and significantly below peak. The cases found in the relatively freer communities are the ones most closely watched for clues as to where Shanghai's outbreak is heading. China has doubled down on its global trend-bucking policy, putting hundreds of millions of people in dozens of cities under movement curbs, causing significant economic damage and disruption to international trade and supply chains. Authorities say their COVID policy is saving lives and point to the millions of deaths caused by the virus elsewhere to justify the strategy. But for many residents it is taking a heavy toll. In an apartment building in Shanghai's central Jing'an district, residents were told once again they could not leave their flats after being allowed out last week to walk around the compound. ""As restrictive as it was, those 10 minutes of freedom, being able to get some fresh air outside my building and walk my dog, kept my sanity,"" building resident Stephanie Sam, 27, said on the WeChat social media site. The re-tightening of curbs has ""taken away the last sliver of hope I had about this dystopian nightmare ending anytime soon."" The district has reported zero community cases and, like other areas in the city, has entered what authorities call ""silent management mode"". That typically means boards or fences around buildings, deliveries forbidden and residents once again confined to their homes.

6,Russian craft flees missile attack near Ukraine's Snake Island,world,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency New satellite images show a Russian boat fleeing a missile attack off the coast of Ukraine's Snake Island. The photos, taken by Maxar Technologies, show a Russian Serna-class landing craft making evasive manoeuvres near smoke contrails expected to be from missiles fired towards the vessel. Both Russia and Ukraine have reported renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days as the battle for control continues in the Black Sea. Last week, Ukraine's defence ministry claimed to have destroyed a Serna-class landing ship with a Bayraktar TB2 drone. The new photos show a sunken boat near a barge with a heavy-lift crane. Photos also show recent damage to buildings on Snake Island, which achieved worldwide fame early in the war when Ukrainian border guards stationed there rejected a Russian warship's demand for their surrender. ""Russian warship, go f**k yourself,"" one soldier said. Russian attacks have been targeting the port of Odessa in Ukraine's west in recent days, attacking airfield infrastructure to prevent Ukrainian forces from operating effectively. The Grand Pettine Hotel, which is located at the beach by the Black sea, has been destroyed by a missile. A building at Odessa Airport has also been damaged, with dark remnants of the attack seen at the bottom of the photo in the middle. There has also been reports of damage to a runway at the airport in recent weeks.

7,Indian parents sue their son for not producing grandchildren,world,"  Indian parents sue son for not producing grandchildren, demand $940,000 payment For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency An Indian couple are taking their son to court, demanding that he and his wife produce either a grandchild within a year or cough up almost $940,000. Sanjeev and Sadhana Prasad say that they exhausted their savings raising and educating their pilot son and paying for a lavish wedding. Now they want payback. ""My son has been married for six years but they are still not planning a baby. At least, if we have a grandchild to spend time with, our pain will become bearable,"" the couple said in their petition filed with a court in Haridwar last week. The compensation they are demanding — 50 million rupees ($938,000) — includes the cost of a wedding reception in a five-star hotel, a luxury car worth $116,000 and paying for the couple's honeymoon abroad, the Times of India reported on Thursday. India's multi-billion-dollar wedding industry has suffered a major blow from the pandemic, but some families are getting around restrictions by tying the knot online instead. The parents also forked out $94,400 to get their son trained as a pilot in the United States, only for him to return to India unemployed, the paper said. ""We also had to take a loan to build our house and now we are going through a lot of financial hardships. Mentally, too, we are quite disturbed because we are living alone,"" the couple said in their petition. The couple's lawyer, Arvind Kumar, said the petition would be taken up for hearing by the court in northern India on May 17. India has a strong joint family system with many generations — including grandparents, nephews, aunts and uncles — often living in the same household. However, in recent years, the trend has shifted, with young couples preferring to move away from their parents or siblings, and wives — such as in this case — opting to work rather than focus on having children and staying at home.

8,Cuban hotel blast death toll hits 45 as last body is recovered ,world,"  Body of last missing person recovered after explosion at Cuba's Hotel Saratoga, raising death toll to 45 For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The body of a waitress who is believed to be the final victim of a deadly explosion at a Cuban hotel has been pulled from the rubble of the destroyed building. About 80 per cent of Havana's Hotel Saratoga was destroyed after a gas leak caused a massive explosion last Friday. Luis Carlos Guzman, the chief of Cuba's firefighting corps, told reporters at the site of the blast that the woman whose body had been recovered, believed to be a waitress at the hotel, was ""as of now, the last missing person."" The death toll now stands at 45, with more than 80 people injured. A Spanish tourist, a pregnant woman and four children from a nearby school were among the dead. The century-old five-star hotel had been due to reopen on Monday after a two-year closure because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Two adjoining apartment buildings were seriously damaged in the blast and 17 structures within a two-block radius suffered lighter damage. Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel has declared a national mourning period in honour of those who died.

9,US parents swap and sell baby formula amidst shortage,world,"  US parents swap and sell baby formula amidst country-wide shortage For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A US-wide baby formula shortage has forced frenzied parents into online groups to swap and sell to each other to keep their babies fed. President Joe Biden has stepped up his administration's response, meeting with executives from Gerber and Reckitt to discuss how they could increase production and how his administration could help, and talking with leaders from Walmart and Target about how to restock shelves and address regional disparities in access to formula, the White House said. The US government plans to monitor possible price gouging and work with trading partners in Mexico, Chile, Ireland and the Netherlands on imports, even though 98 per cent of baby formula is domestically made. The problem is the result of supply chain disruptions and a safety recall, and has had a cascade of effects: retailers are limiting what customers can buy, and doctors and health workers are urging parents to contact food banks or physicians' offices, in addition to warning against watering down formula to stretch supplies or using online DIY recipes. The shortage is weighing particularly on lower-income families after the recall by formula maker Abbott, stemming from contamination concerns. The recall wiped out many brands covered by WIC, a federal program like food stamps that serves women, infants and children, though the program now permits brand substitutes. Mr Biden's administration is working with states to make it easier for WIC recipients to buy different sizes of formula that their benefits might not currently cover. About half of infant formula nationwide is purchased by participants using WIC benefits, according to the White House. Clara Hinton, 30, of Hartford, Connecticut, is among that group. She has a 10-month-old daughter, Patiennce, who has an allergy that requires a special formula. Ms Hinton, who has no car, has been taking the bus to the suburbs, going from town to town, and finally found some of the proper formula at a box store in West Hartford. But she said the store refused to take her WIC card, not the first time that has happened. Ms Hinton said her baby recently ran out of formula from an already opened can she got from a friend. ""She has no formula,"" she said. ""I just put her on regular milk. What do I do? Her paediatrician made it clear I'm not supposed to be doing that, but what do I do?"" In Utah, fellow WIC card holder Elizabeth Amador has been going store-to-store every day after she finishes work at a call centre in Salt Lake City in desperate search of one particular formula her nine-month-old daughter needs. She recently was down to only one can, but had four cans on Thursday. She said she won't stop her cumbersome daily routine until she knows the shortage is over. ""It sucks, you know, because of high gas prices,"" Ms Amador said. ""We're having to drive everywhere to find formula. It's stressing."" Some parents are also using social media to bridge supply gaps. Ashley Maddox, a 31-year-old mother of two from San Diego, started a Facebook group on Wednesday after failing to find formula for her five-month-old son, Cole, at the commissary on the Navy base. ""I connected with a gal in my group and she had seven cans of the formula I need that were just sitting in her house that her baby didn't need anymore,"" she said. ""So I drove out, it was about a 20-minute drive and picked it up and paid her. It was a miracle."" She said there was already a stigma attached to being a non-breastfeeding mum and that the group has become supportive. ""To not be able to have that formula, it's scary,"" she said. Jennifer Kersey, 36 of Cheshire, Connecticut, said she was down to her last can of formula for her seven-month-old son, Blake Kersey Jr, before someone saw her post on a Facebook group and came by with a few sample cans. She said she and others in the group are helping each other, finding stores that might have the formula in stock and getting it to mothers who need it. ""At first I was starting to panic,"" she said. ""But, I'm a believer in the Lord, so I said, 'God, I know you're going to provide for me' and I just started reaching out to people, 'Hey do you have this formula?'"" Kimberly Anderson, 34, of Hartford County, Maryland, said her seven-month-old son takes a prescription formula that has been nearly impossible to find locally. She turned to social media and said people in Utah and Boston found the formula, which she paid to have shipped. ""They say it takes a village to raise a baby,"" she said. ""Little did I know my village spans the entire US as I ping friends, family for their zip codes so I can check their local Walmarts to have them ship directly to me."" Parents desperately searching for infant formula on retailer websites such as Amazon and Google are being served up with products intended for toddlers, including powdered toddler goat milk and plant-based milk powders. One banner ad across Amazon offers ""organic non GMO formula for babies & toddlers,"" but a closer inspection of the product's image shows that it is only intended for children over 12 months. Other ads for toddler milk appear on Amazon's website on pages for out-of-stock infant formula. Toddler milk cans often closely resemble that of infant formula, but the ingredients are distinct, with toddler milks sometimes boasting more sugar, calories, said Frances Fleming-Milici, UConn's Director of Marketing Initiatives at the Rudd Center who has studied toddler milk packaging. Toddler milk also does not follow FDA standards for formula. ""It's not like you're buying a pair of shoes. This is a little bit more serious,"" Ms Fleming-Milici said. ""It's serving up something that you should not be giving to your child."" Dr Navneet Hundal, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said she and other pediatricians have been grappling with the formula shortage for months. Formula companies have stopped giving out samples that she could pass on to parents, she said. She advises new parents to talk to their pediatricians to see if there are other brands of formula that they can safely give their newborns. ""This is ruling our clinical practices right now,"" she said. A safety recall compounded the challenges. The Food and Drug Administration warned consumers on February 17 to avoid some powdered baby formula products from a Sturgis, Michigan, facility run by Abbott Nutrition, which then initiated a voluntary recall. According to findings released in March by federal safety inspectors, Abbott failed to maintain sanitary conditions and procedures at the plant. The FDA launched its investigation after four babies became sick with a rare bacterial infection after consuming formula manufactured at the plant. All four were hospitalised and two died. Chicago-based Abbott said in a statement, ""there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses."" Samples of the bacteria collected from the infants did not match those found in the company's factory, Abbott noted. Abbott said that pending FDA approval, ""we could restart the site within two weeks."" The company would begin by first producing EleCare, Alimentum and metabolic formulas and then start production of Similac and other formulas. Once production began, it would take six to eight weeks for the baby formula to be available on shelves. On Tuesday, the FDA said it was working with US manufacturers to increase their output and streamline paperwork to allow more imports. ""We recognise that this is certainly a challenge for people across the country, something the president is very focused on and we're going to do everything we can to cut red tape and take steps to increase supply,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.

10,"'Holy cow, plants can grow in lunar soil': Scientists reveal hope for life on the Moon",world,"  Plants grow in lunar soil for the first time, as NASA plans for life on the Moon For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Scientists have used lunar soil collected during Apollo missions to grow plants for the first time. The results have been deemed promising enough that NASA is envisioning hothouses on the Moon for the next generation of lunar explorers. Researchers from the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences last year planted thale cress in soil collected by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and other astronauts. All the seeds sprouted but the plants ended up stunted, scientists revealed in results published on Thursday. The team of experts said they were initially dubious but are now planning to repeat the experiment with greater success. ""For their first week or so of life, there was really no difference between the controls and the lunar plant, so there wasn't something inherently toxic to the plants in lunar regolith [soil] that would prevent plants from growing,"" said University of Florida biologist and geneticist Anna-Lisa Paul. ""So everything else downstream is how can we mitigate any negative responses. That was the start and the positive spin on all of this."" The research could have implications for NASA astronauts heading to the Moon in coming years. ""That was the first step in what's going to hopefully be a very long, multi-decade process of figuring this stuff out and when we get back to the Moon, doing it on the lunar surface,"" University of Florida geologist Stephen Elardo said. His University of Florida colleague Robert Ferl said the team's first thought was: ""Holy cow, plants can grow in lunar soil.""

11,The son of an ousted dictator has won the Philippines presidency. Why are some Filipino Australians 'extremely happy'?,world,"  Ferdinand Marcos Jr is set to become the Philippines president – it's a dictator family revival that has divided Filipino Australians For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Faye Faustino will be turning 53 in a few weeks' time and says the outcome of the Philippines presidential election is the perfect birthday present. ""I was awake for 24 hours, looking every hour for the updates,"" she told the ABC. ""I'm extremely happy."" Like Ms Faustino, the Filipino community across Australia wasn't shy in making their views known in the lead-up to one of the Philippines' most divisive elections in decades. They faced a stark choice – the son of a dictator versus a human rights lawyer. At times there has been some animosity between rival supporter groups. And this week, many Filipinos across the country are not sharing Ms Faustino's elation. Vice-president Leni Robredo — the main rival to frontrunner Ferdinand Marcos Jr, better known as ""Bongbong"" (or BBM for short) – won the most absentee votes at the Philippine Consulate General in Sydney and Melbourne. That wasn't indicative of how it played out overall. An official result is expected around the end of the month, but with more than 90 per cent of votes counted, Mr Marcos, who ran alongside the daughter of outgoing president Rodrigo Duterte, has clinched a runaway victory. It is the first win by a majority since a 1986 revolution that toppled the two-decade dictatorship of Mr Marcos's late father. ""I'm disappointed, mad, and sad,"" 20-year-old Vince de Guzman said. However, the Sydney student has vowed to not be disheartened. ""The moment that we, the youth, feel disheartened, that's when we actually lose. We all know that the fight for a better Philippines will never end,"" he told the ABC. Several thousand protesters, mainly young people, held a demonstration outside the election commission headquarters in Manila after preliminary results were announced. On Wednesday night at Melbourne's Federation Square, a ""No to Marcos-Duterte 2022"" event condemning what the organisers are calling the ""fascist tandem"" was also held. ""Bongbong Marcos and Sara Duterte will surely continue their fathers' gruesome legacies of mass human rights violations, theft and plunder,"" advocacy group Anakbayan Melbourne said. Thousands of opponents of Marcos senior suffered persecution during a brutal 1972-1981 era of martial law, and the family name became synonymous with plunder, cronyism and extravagant living, with billions of dollars of state wealth disappearing. Thirty-six years after his corrupt father was ousted, Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr looks set to step into the role of Philippines president. However, the Marcos family denies any wrongdoing – and so too do many of today's Filipino voters. Ms Faustino lived through Marcos senior's reign in the Philippines, but believes that time was ""very, very good"". She said the narratives around Marcos senior's dictatorship were propaganda. ""Social media contributed a big help in enlightening, or opening the mindset of Filipino people,"" Ms Faustino said. Liz Ficnerski, who is an organiser of a Melbourne supporter group for Mr Marcos and Sara Duterte, shares that opinion. ""I never thought that Ferdinand Marcos was a dictator anyway,"" the 55-year-old told the ABC. ""He was the kind of president that did a lot for the Philippines. We would love that to come back."" Mr Guzman was taught about the notorious Marcos political dynasty at school and can't understand how so many BBM supporters, bloggers and social media influencers say historical accounts are distorted. On a plane stuffed with diamonds and $1 million in cash, Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos fled the Philippines. Three decades later, their son is set to become the country's next president. He said he and his friends were able to share information and keep up with the political situation back home through social media, but the role it has played in the election is a ""double-edged sword"". ""Having Bongbong Marcos as a candidate shows how much social media can play into this,"" he said. ""It's accepting the false fact that the Marcos era was the greatest and it just wasn't — so many people were harmed and tortured, and money was stolen."" Aim Sinpeng, a senior lecturer in the department of government and international relations at the University of Sydney, said this was not a unique situation for the Philippines. Around the world, politicians have used social media as a tool to remake themselves by providing alternative information or facts, she said. ""It's clever political marketing on part of the BBM campaign in leveraging social media to rewrite history,"" Dr Sinpeng told the ABC. ""There's a fine line between rebranding and creating a new image and persona, and creating alternative information that counters facts."" She said what differed with this election compared to 2016 was the shift towards platforms like TikTok. ""Tik Tok is important because it is a home to amateurs, not professional influencers,"" she said. ""I think that kind of grassroots influence, which is far less monitored than Facebook, has given the space for the BBM campaign to really grow extensively."" Marie Anne San Gabriel spoke at last month's ""Paint Adelaide Pink Sunday"" event in support of Ms Robredo. Ms Gabriel said she wasn't only worried about corruption, but fears the Marcos government will leave many Filipinos behind. Ms Robredo had promised a government that focused on the marginalised. ""My candidate was already helping people from really poor areas,"" Ms Gabriel said. ""For many people in the Philippines, their situation is critical."" While there has been speculation about electoral fraud and reports of faulty voting machines, Ms Gabriel said it was hard to deny the landslide result. The unofficial tally shows Mr Marcos has 31 million votes, double that of Ms Robredo. ""We must accept the defeat, it's the bravest thing to do,"" Ms Gabriel said. Terry Alpines – who organises fundraising events for her village back in the Philippines through Circulo Capizeno of Melbourne (CCM) – said the country needed an administration with heart. ""In the Philippines, if you're rich, you are really rich, but if you're poor, you are very, very poor,"" the 69-year-old said. ""I'm just praying and hoping that this time it's going to be different … hopefully, he's going to make the Philippines much, much better than what his father did."" On the campaign trail, Mr Marcos gave few clues of what his policy agenda would look like, beyond pushing his message of ""unity"". Analysts expect Mr Marcos to focus on completing Mr Duterte's multi-billion-dollar infrastructure upgrade and to seek closer ties with China. Some thought existing problems of corruption and nepotism in the Philippines could worsen. Rado Gatchalian, a vocal supporter of Mr Marcos and national rally organiser, said he wasn't worried about corruption. Since Marcos senior was driven into exile by the ""People Power Revolution"" in 1986, nothing has happened to improve the Philippines political landscape, Mr Gatchalian said. In fact, since then he believes it has worsened. ""There were many corruptions, there were many abuses. So the thing that they hate about Marcos, it happened after Marcos as well,"" he said. He also trusts the accounts of elders in the Philippines who have told him that the Marcos senior era was the best the Philippines has seen. ""Many, many elders with conviction would say to me that president Marcos was the best president of the Republic of the Philippines – that the Philippines was better off during his time compared to those presidents succeeded him,"" he said. The 43-year-old Sydney resident was happy with some of the changes Mr Duterte made, saying he made the streets safer and expected that Mr Marcos will continue with many of his policies. Other Marcos supporters mentioned the campaign promise for cheaper utilities and a follow on of Mr Duterte's focus on big infrastructure projects. In regard to talk of closer ties with Russia and China, Mr Gatchalian said he did not consider that as an issue. Sophia Maranan, a 20-year-old Sydney university student, said however the next six years play out, she and her friends would keep fighting against misinformation and corruption. ""This is not the end of our fight,"" she said. ""We have to make sure they are accountable for their actions as the leaders of the country.""

12,"Chinese Foreign Minister to visit Solomon Islands, with security pact signing likely",world,"  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to visit Solomon Islands, wider Pacific visit likely For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Chinese Foreign Minister and state councillor Wang Yi is likely to make a surprise visit to Solomon Islands in coming weeks, in another sign Beijing is intent on cementing security and commercial ties with the Pacific island nation while Canberra is consumed by the federal election. A senior Solomon Islands government source told the ABC that preparations had begun for Mr Wang to visit the capital Honiara. The visit is not expected to happen this week but is likely to occur later in May, potentially before the federal election next weekend. Australian officials and ministers are monitoring the planned visit very closely. One federal government source told the ABC they believed it was likely Mr Wang would travel to Honiara as part of a broader visit to a number of Pacific island countries, but added that some of the plans may still be in flux. Still, the prospect of Mr Wang making a high-level visit to Honiara ahead of the election on May 21 has stirred anxiety in the Coalition, with fears the visit could once again catapult the China-Solomon Islands security pact back into the headlines, and allow Labor to attack its national security credentials just before the election. Experts say a new security agreement signed by Beijing and Honiara is ""qualitatively different' to Beijing's past agreements with Pacific nations and the geopolitical context has changed. One government source told the ABC Mr Wang would lead a large Chinese delegation and the two countries would likely sign a host of new agreements during the trip. It is also possible the minister will formally sign the deeply contentious security pact that has already been agreed to by both Solomon Islands and China. The news of his visit comes in the wake of a regional meeting on the China-Solomon Islands agreement, which was held at the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in Fiji's capital Suva on Tuesday. Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Jeremiah Manele and Police Minister Veke briefed several senior officials and a small number of politicians from Pacific Island countries about the agreement in an effort to calm regional anxieties about its implications. The ABC has been told that a number of Pacific Island countries raised concerns about the security agreement, and that many indicated it should be discussed by Pacific leaders when they meet at the Pacific Islands Forum in Suva next month. Defence Minister Peter Dutton told Sky News the mooted trip did not ""come as a surprise to anyone"" and suggested it was part of a pattern of aggressive behaviour by China. ""It's obviously provocative, particularly during the course of an election campaign, that China has made that decision,"" he said. ""And I think we, again, need to be eyes wide open about what is happening [with China] in our region, and not just in our region."" Scott Morrison says the government will take a ""calm and composed"" approach to Solomon Islands if re-elected, after its Prime Minister launched a tirade in parliament about Australia's response to its new security pact with China. Graeme Smith from the Australian National University said if the trip went ahead then China might use it to announce fresh investments in mining or tuna processing in Solomon Islands. ""With a delegation of this nature, especially at a time of heightened geopolitical rhetoric, the interesting question is what gifts are going to be on offer, other than grant aid related to the South Pacific Games,"" he said. He also said the visit might also provoke protests in Solomon Islands, with unpredictable results. The China security pact has been fiercely criticised by the Solomon Islands' opposition and civil society groups, and protesters – including many from the pro-Taiwan province of Malaita –flooded Honiara in November last year. ""The pot is being stirred on the PRC [People's Republic of China] side, but a fascinating hypothetical is: what if protests greet Wang Yi's visit?"" Mr Smith said. ""What if the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force can't guarantee his security? Who steps up?"" The Chinese embassy in Canberra has been contacted for comment.

13,Anger in Afghanistan as some women defy Taliban full burka order,world,"  Anger in Afghanistan as some women defy Taliban full burka order For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Some women in Afghanistan are resisting an order from the ruling Taliban to wear the all-covering burka in public as rights continued to be threatened in the country. The Taliban on Saturday announced the decree from supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada that all women should where the chadori — a head-to-toe cloak — because it is ""traditional and respectful"". It was a major blow to the rights of women in Afghanistan, who for two decades had been living with relative freedom before the Taliban takeover last August — when the US and other foreign forces, including Australia, withdrew in the chaotic end to a 20-year war. But not all Afghan women are wanting to obey the latest order. Arooza, who asked to be referred to by that name for protection, said she was furious, afraid and alert for Taliban on patrol as she and a friend shopped on Sunday in Kabul's Macroyan neighbourhood. The mathematics teacher was fearful her large shawl, wrapped tight around her head and sweeping pale brown coat would not satisfy the order because her face was visible. Arooza said the Taliban rulers were driving Afghans to leave their country. ""Why should I stay here if they don't want to give us our human rights? We are human,"" she said. In the Afghan capital of Kabul on Sunday, women wore the customary conservative Muslim dress. Most wore a traditional hijab, consisting of a headscarf and long robe or coat, but few covered their faces, as directed by the Taliban leader a day earlier. Those wearing a burka, a head-to-toe garment that covers the face and hides the eyes behind netting, were in the minority. Shabana is another Afghan woman furious with the order from the Taliban. Wearing bright gold bangles beneath her flowing black coat, with her hair hidden behind a black headscarf with sequins, she said the Taliban were not interested in tradition. ""Women in Afghanistan wear the hijab, and many wear the burka, but this isn't about hijab, this is about the Taliban wanting to make all women disappear,"" she said. ""This is about the Taliban wanting to make us invisible."" Obaidullah Baheer, a former lecturer at the American University in Afghanistan said these decisions could have consequences for the ruling Taliban. ""These edicts attempt to erase a whole gender and generation of Afghans who grew up dreaming of a better world,"" Mr Baheer said. Officials from Afghanistan's Ariana Afghan airlines and Kam Air say the Taliban have ordered them to stop boarding women if they are travelling alone ""It pushes families to leave the country by any means necessary. ""It also fuels grievances that would eventually spill over into large-scale mobilisation against the Taliban."" After decades of war, Mr Baheer said it would not have taken much on the Taliban's part to make Afghans content with their rule, ""an opportunity that the Taliban are wasting fast"". The Taliban have made several orders that hark back to their previous rule from 1996 to 2001. An order from Mr Akhundzada in March ahead of the school year banned girls from attending school beyond grade six. In the weeks ahead of the start of the school year, senior Taliban officials had told journalists all girls would be allowed back in school. But Mr Akhunzada asserted that allowing the older girls back to school violated Islamic principles. In December, the Taliban issued another decree barring women from travelling without a close male relative as a chaperone. ""Women travelling for more than 45 miles (72 kilometres) should not be offered a ride if they are not accompanied by a close family member,"" ministry spokesman Sadeq Akif Muhaji said at the time.

14,DFAT tells Chinese officials of 'serious concerns' about Solomon Islands security pact,world,"  Australian officials raise 'serious concerns' with China about Solomon Islands deal For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) have used rare talks with their Chinese counterparts to raise ""serious concerns"" about Beijing's new security pact with Solomon Islands and to stress the depth of Australia's connections with the Pacific. Mid-ranking public servants from both countries held the virtual talks on the Pacific last Friday. The ABC was told that the Department's most senior diplomats – including the Head of the Office of the Pacific, Ewen McDonald – did not participate. The Department's account of the discussion was heavily focused on China's contentious agreement with Solomon Islands. A host of senior Australian politicians have warned the pact could destabilise the region, while Australian security agencies fear it could open the door to a Chinese military presence in the Pacific Island nation down the track. In a statement the Department said the officials ""raised directly with their Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs counterparts Australia's serious concerns about the Solomon Islands-China security agreement, the lack of transparency and its implications for continuing regional security and stability"". The statement also said that Australian officials ""emphasised that Australia is a Pacific nation with deep, long-standing connections with our Pacific family across all arms of government and right across our society"". However, multiple Australian government sources emphasised that the talks had been in the works for several months, and were not triggered by news of the security pact. The Department first proposed reviving the diplomatic dialogue after senior Chinese diplomat Wang Xining wrote an opinion piece late last year declaring that Beijing wanted to help Australia restore order in Solomon Islands in the wake of devastating riots. Australian officials viewed that offer with deep scepticism. Experts say a new security agreement signed by Beijing and Honiara is ""qualitatively different' to Beijing's past agreements with Pacific nations and the geopolitical context has changed. Analysts said at the time that Australia likely proposed resuming talks on the Pacific because it would allow the government to effectively call Beijing's bluff if it declined to participate. Still, sources told the ABC that landing a formal exchange with even mid-ranking Chinese officials had been a time-consuming process, and that the discussion had not led to any real breakthroughs. In its statement the Department said its officials ""reinforced Australia's abiding commitment to the security architecture of our region, including the Boe Declaration and Biketawa Declaration and the Treaty of Rarotonga"". The Department also said they emphasised that ""the Pacific family remains best placed to meet the security needs of Pacific island countries comprehensively"" – repeating one of the main lines the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have used to undermine the China-Solomon Islands pact. The Department added that both countries ""exchanged views"" on a host of other regional issues including ""climate change adaptation and resilience, COVID-19 response and recovery, fisheries and maritime issues, and infrastructure development across the region"". The meeting was held on the same day that Foreign Minister Marise Payne met her Solomon Islands counterpart Jeremiah Manele for the first time since the Pacific Island country signed the contentious pact with China. Senator Payne said that Mr Manele used that meeting in Brisbane to reaffirm that Solomon Islands would not permit China to establish a military base, and to again state that Australia remains his country's primary security partner. Foreign Minister Marise Payne has met with her Solomon Islands counterpart for the first time since the Pacific nation signed a controversial pact with China, saying she ""reiterated our deep concerns about the security agreement"". The Solomon Islands Foreign Minister is now in Fiji for talks with senior officials as he begins a tour aimed at calming regional anxieties about the agreement with China. But the Solomon Islands Opposition has slammed the government's tactics, saying it should have consulted other Pacific nations about the pact before signing it, rather than after. The flurry of talks comes against the backdrop of increasing hostility between Australia and the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands Manasseh Sogavare, who last week lashed out once against at the West, accusing it of deliberately undermining his government and plotting an invasion. The ABC has asked the Chinese Embassy if it has any comment on the talks, but has not yet received a response.

Unlike neighbouring continental giants, Pacific Island countries are isolated and surrounded by vast ocean, without the geographical, environmental, or financial security a large, wealthy landmass provides. Many fear they are one volcanic eruption, one cyclone, or a minor sea level rise away from total uninhabitability. The consequences of which are not only the loss of sovereignty and refugee crises, but the loss of one of the most culturally diverse, vibrant and important regions of the world — home to hundreds of unique languages, indigenous cultures, and endemic flora and fauna. For Pacific Island nations, climate change is not a debatable future concern open to interpretation, but a present reality that boils down to one fundamental question: can we afford to entertain the possibility that climate change is not an urgent existential threat, and be wrong? On the frontlines, the answer is simple: No. Also available in: Tok Pisin, Chinese & Indonesian *Editor's Note: The information gathered for this story encompasses 20 years of ABC reporting on climate change in the Pacific presented against the latest research and statements from leading research bodies.

16,'You just stop caring.' How Australian Kylie Moore-Gilbert endured over two years as a prisoner in Iran,world,"  Kylie Moore-Gilbert spent 804 days in prison in Iran. She says without public attention she'd still be there For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Even after a week of being interrogated in an Iranian prison, Kylie Moore-Gilbert had no doubt her captors would soon realise they'd made a mistake and release her. Despite the privacy invasion, she gave up her email passwords because, as she tells ABC RN's Between the Lines, ""I had nothing to hide"". Unfortunately, her innocence wasn't enough to protect her. Between the Lines puts contemporary issues into a broader context, seeking new perspectives and challenging accepted wisdoms. She didn't know it then but Dr Moore-Gilbert, a Melbourne-based scholar of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, was at the start of a years-long nightmare. For the next 804 days, she would endure solitary confinement, psychological torture and degrading, dehumanising treatment at the hands of her captors. Now that she's finally home, she wants Australia and other countries to reconsider the way they deal with hostages, so that others who are still imprisoned in foreign countries have a stronger chance of being freed. Dr Moore-Gilbert was arrested in 2018 in Tehran, where she'd been invited by an Iranian university to attend an academic conference. She'd applied for a visa in advance at the Iranian embassy in Canberra. This wasn't a requirement for Australians, who can get a visa upon arrival. However, as she says, ""I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and allow them to look into my background. ""Given it's an authoritarian regime, you assume they will"". The visa was approved and Dr Moore-Gilbert saw no indication there would be any issues travelling to the conference. She'd travelled to numerous Middle Eastern countries in the past and never had a problem. But at the Tehran airport, as she was preparing to make her way home, Dr Moore-Gilbert was arrested by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), also known as the Revolutionary Guards. This former militia group has extended to ""literally cover every aspect of Iranian economic and social governmental life as well as obviously military capabilities,"" she says. 'Every day is a day of suffering': Former inmates describe mock executions, beatings and psychological ""torture"" in the notorious prison where several Australians have been held. A year into her incarceration, Dr Moore-Gilbert learnt that her then-husband's background may have had something to do with her arrest. She says she was ""put on trial and charged with espionage for the 'Zionist regime'"". ""My [now] ex-husband did have an Israeli passport but he was born in Russia, in the Soviet Union, and migrated to Australia and now lives in Australia. So the link to Israel was there. But it's fairly tenuous,"" she says. Being an Israeli spy wasn't the only charge. ""During my interrogations, I was accused of all sorts of ludicrous things,"" Dr Moore-Gilbert says. ""I was told I'm an Australian spy, I'm an MI6 agent. I'm a Bahraini spy … I'm a fake academic. They threw all sorts of accusations at me. ""But ultimately, in court, I was convicted, in a very sham process, of being an Israeli spy."" Incarceration in an Iranian prison is ""indescribable"", says Dr Moore-Gilbert. ""It's like being transported into an alternative reality or an alternative world. Time moves differently. You lose track of who you are as a person. You become dehumanised into a number rather than an individual with a name and a character and a personality. ""At the beginning, it hurts and it's tough, but you just efface yourself to the point that you become apathetic about everything, and you just stop caring,"" says Dr Moore-Gilbert, who has written about her experience in the memoir, The Uncaged Sky. In her first interview after being freed from an Iranian prison, Australian academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert says she contemplated suicide while enduring ""psychological torture"". Dr Moore-Gilbert spent long periods of time banned from consular assistance ""as a punishment"" and was cut off from the outside world for lengthy stretches of her incarceration. Family phone calls would also be banned as punishment. It meant Dr Moore-Gilbert often had little knowledge about what was going on outside prison. Tougher still was the solitary confinement she was subjected to as a form of ""psychological torture"". ""It's deliberate. They know exactly what they're doing. You're going into solitary as an interrogation strategy to break you, so that you will either make a false confession … [or] give up any information of interest,"" she says. ""It's inhumane, it's degrading, and it's really, really tough to go through."" The fact that Moore-Gilbert's captors belonged to ""a kind of a state within a state in Iran"" and were ""not part of the formal or official Iranian government"" made negotiating her release particularly tricky. ""The Australian government had a bit of a conundrum on its hands,"" she says. ""Following diplomatic protocol, it had to speak to the Iranian government, to the Iranian foreign ministry about me. But the Iranian foreign ministry has no control over what the Revolutionary Guards are doing. And in fact, they're rivals of the Revolutionary Guards. ""That very much complicated the situation for the Australians, they had to figure out who to talk to and, once they did, how not to alienate the Iranian government in talking to their rivals,"" she says. Dr Moore-Gilbert was eventually released in late 2020, after what she describes as an ""incredible trilateral diplomatic deal"". Orchestrated by the Australian government, it involved the release of three convicted Iranian IRGC terrorists from a Thai prison in exchange for Dr Moore-Gilbert's release. But she believes that she could've been released sooner if there was more pressure on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). She argues that if more questions were asked of the diplomatic corps, all the way up to the minister of foreign affairs, about those who are imprisoned, things would move more swiftly. She believes this sense of ""being watched and checked up on"" would push them ""to actually do more and show they're doing more"". More media attention would have assisted in that, she says. Throughout her incarceration, the official advice to her family from Canberra was to keep a low profile and let the government negotiate her release away from the glare of the spotlight. He was flying to Malaysia for a holiday, but Barry Manners unexpectedly found himself in a war zone in Kuwait. But Dr Moore-Gilbert thinks a higher profile and intense media attention would've been more successful. ""I understood that [media attention] couldn't be detrimental to me; that my captors weren't going to harm me as a result of it, despite the Australian government telling my family that,"" she says. ""I saw evidence from other prisoners, because there were a lot of high-profile political prisoners in the facility where I was being held … that it actually could help me in terms of having a spotlight on my prison conditions, my lack of medical treatment, for example, and shaming the Iranians into doing better and providing me with more humane conditions."" That's exactly the effect it did have after a year when her situation was made public. ""My conditions did improve, and greater care and attention was put on, for example, [demands] to see a doctor [or for] edible food and not the disgusting prison fare. It really did have that effect,"" Dr Moore-Gilbert says. ""So I think that media attention did play a big role in getting me out when I did, after 804 days. And had my situation remained quiet and hidden, I could still be there right now."" Internationally, the way to tackle state hostage taking is ""a sort of a grey area"", she says. ""Each country just sort of goes it alone … trying to release their citizen who might be held captive abroad."" Not many countries collaborate with one another on this issue and ""that's a real shame"", she says. Dr Moore-Gilbert hopes that writing about her experience will encourage the Australian government to rethink its handling of hostages, and countries to work together better to achieve faster results.

17,Russians to be deported from Bali for obscene Instagram content,world,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency It's known as the Island of the Gods, but that's lost on some Western influencers who like its picturesque temples and landscapes for risque social media content. Russian yogi influencer Alina Fazleeva and her husband, Andrey, will be deported and barred from entering Indonesia for six months, after Ms Fazleeva offended Balinese Hindus by posting images of herself posing naked on a centuries-old sacred tree. Known as Kayu Putih, which translates as ""white wood"", the giant tree behind Babakan Temple in Bali's Tabanan district is believed by locals to be 700 years old. The image went viral after Niluh Djelantik — a prominent Balinese fashion designer and politician — posted a screenshot asking people to report Alina to immigration authorities and the police. ""She should be responsible for the cost of the cleaning ceremony to be carried out by villagers,"" Ms Djelantik said. ""Trashy tourist. Go home!"" she later posted. Ms Fazleeva deleted the offensive post and published another photo depicting herself offering prayers while clothed at the same tree. ""I apologise to all the people of Bali and Indonesia. I regret what I have done,"" she wrote in Indonesian. ""I am so ashamed, I did not mean to offend you in any way, I had no knowledge of this place,"" she said. ""I just prayed under the tree and went straight to the police station to explain this and apologise."" Despite the apology, Bali's Governor, Wayan Koster, personally ordered her deportation, saying in a statement it was ""far important to preserve the culture and respect the dignity of Bali"" than tolerate such behaviour for tourist dollars. Ravinjay Kuckreja researches indigenous religion at the State Hindu University of Denpasar in Bali and hosts the Being Bali podcast on local culture. He said that, for Balinese Hindus, ""sources of water like springs, statues, trees and volcanoes are amongst the many everyday objects that are sanctified and regarded as sacred"". Having one's naked body against a holy tree was thus considered ""sacrilege"" by Balinese Hindus, who revere large trees as embodying ""a divine ogre named Banaspati Raja (lord of the forests)"", Mr Kuckreja said. ""The tree is completely sacred ... it is considered a manifestation of God,"" he said. The incident came shortly after immigration officials said they would deport a Canadian man who had filmed himself attempting the ceremonial Māori Haka on a volcano worshipped by Balinese Hindus. Jeffrey Craigen, a self-described ""mind body healer"", live-streamed himself dancing, naked, on the peak of Mt Batur while proclaiming that stripping naked made him into a ""fearless child of God"". Mr Kuckreja said that dancing naked at Mt Batur was considered even worse than posing naked on the tree, because the volcano was ""exceptionally sacred"" for Balinese Hindus. Jamaruli Manihuruk, the immigration head in Bali, said locals across the province were urged to ""proactively monitor and report various violations committed by foreigners to authorities [so that they can take] strict action"". Neither Ms Fazleeva nor Mr Craigen responded to requests for comment. Such incidents are not new in Bali. In August 2019 — shortly before the pandemic devastated the local tourism industry — a Czech couple uploaded a video of themselves splashing holy water on intimate body parts during a visit to a Hindu temple complex. Another video recently circulated on Indonesian social media appears to show a Caucasian man masturbating under a waterfall in Bali. The island welcomed more than six million international travellers in 2019. With Indonesia's borders largely closed due to COVID-19 in 2021, however, Bali saw only around 50 foreign tourists for the whole year. Bali is welcoming back most international tourists, including Australians, without a requirement to quarantine. Other holiday destinations in South-East Asia are also scrapping restrictions for foreign travellers. Direct international flights to the island resumed in February 2022 and fully vaccinated travellers are no longer required to quarantine upon arrival. With life approaching normal and an influx of foreigners to Bali, so returns tourists behaving badly. ""Balinese culture, Balinese ancestral beliefs, and Hinduism, are one in everyday life in Bali,"" said AA Ngurah Adi Ardhana, a local MP and deputy head of the Indonesian Association of Hotels and Restaurants in Bali. He said tourists came to Bali for many reasons and that authorities needed to be prepared for such incidents by educating foreigners about local customs and maintaining the sanctity of holy sites. ""Preventing it is far better than having to repeat it and causing disturbances to this sanctity,"" Mr Ardhana told the ABC. Hindus account for some 90 per cent of Bali's population and around 2 per cent of the total population of Indonesia — a Muslim-majority country where religion is fundamental to identity and plays a major role in cultural and political life. A 2020 Pew survey found 98 per cent of Indonesians said religion was ""very important"" to their lives, compared to just 18 per cent of people in Australia. It was one of Bali’s best kept secrets, then tourism boomed. Now COVID has forced locals back to nature. Blasphemy is illegal in Indonesia, with most high-profile cases consisting of a member of a minority religion offending Muslims. Jakarta's former Christian governor, Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama, was controversially jailed in 2017 for supposedly blaspheming Islam. Mr Kuckreja said that, while Balinese Hindus rarely had the opportunity to claim blasphemy against members of the Muslim community, in the case of foreigners, it was different. ""It's about getting their rights, about getting respect,"" he said. Indonesia's Tourism Minister, Sandiaga Uno, said recently that he was keen to promote traditional culture via ""tourism villages"" to international visitors in Bali for the G20 conference in November. Mr Kuckreja said that within Balinese culture, visitors from other parts of Indonesia and from overseas were considered ""guests"" and thus treated with the island's famous hospitality. ""It becomes really weird when the guest would then do something obscene … It's kind of misusing the hospitality that they are giving to guests."" It is not difficult to identify holy places in Bali, he said, given that trees and other objects were usually adorned with offerings and ceremonial cloth. ""[Tourists] should really understand that they are guests and they don't own everything. Before they want to do something, just ask,"" Mr Kuckreja said. ""It's just so much more polite to ask, 'Hey, can I hug your tree naked?' and get an appropriate response.""

18,Why India rejects the WHO's COVID-19 death toll estimates  ,world,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency In April 2021, Kailash Tiwari lost his previously healthy 100-year-old father in India to COVID-19. Soon after that, two close family members aged in their 60s died with the virus. Several of his friends, colleagues and professors also lost their lives during the country's severe Delta variant outbreak. ""Each and every house had at least one or two people that died,"" Mr Tiwari told the ABC. Mr Tiwari left his home in Adelaide to visit India shortly before the country was struck by a catastrophic COVID-19 wave between April and June of last year. He was able to enjoy walks with his father in a small village of 50 people in Indore before nearly half of the residents were infected with the virus. India's Delta wave sparked a humanitarian crisis created by an acute shortage of hospital beds, medicines and oxygen. Amid a deluge of deaths, Delhi residents reported having to keep the bodies of loved ones at home for days. Mr Tiwari's family was able to give his father a proper burial, but for many others, that was not the case. ""In many cases, they [the bodies] were not handled properly. [I heard] they were even thrown in the rubbish bin,"" he said. At the height of the outbreak, workers at makeshift facilities were carrying out mass burials and cremations. Aerial photos showed funeral pyres just metres apart in packed open crematoriums and bodies burning atop piles of wood in car parks. Despite the clear signs of the large-scale impact of the virus, the country's official COVID-19 death toll sits at about 520,000. But this week the Indian government said there had been 475,000 excess deaths (out of 8.1 million total deaths) in 2020 compared to the previous year. Vinod Kumar Paul, a top health official who has overseen India's fight against the pandemic, said there was nothing ""dramatic"" in the total death data for 2020 and the numbers were ""absolute, correct and counted"". The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 15 million people died during the pandemic to the end of 2021, more than double the official reported tally of 5.4 million. India's figures were released ahead of the World Health Organization (WHO) report on global excess death estimates, which New Delhi openly opposes due to what it says are its ""questionable"" methods. Thursday's report — the most comprehensive look at the true global toll of the pandemic so far — said that globally there were 14.9 million excess deaths associated with COVID-19 by the end of 2021. The new figure from the WHO is more than double the official reported tally of 5.4 million deaths. The report suggests that 4.7 million people died in India between January 2020 and December 2021 as a result of the pandemic, mainly during a huge surge in May and June last year. It therefore attributes almost half of the deaths that until now had not been counted to India. The WHO's excess mortality figures reflect people who died of COVID as well as those who died as an indirect result of the outbreak, including people who could not access health care for other conditions when systems were overwhelmed during huge waves of infection. So how can data from the Indian government and the WHO differ so dramatically? Since the start of the pandemic, experts have believed that official government figures have been significantly under-reported. Rukmini S, an independent data journalist from Chennai, India, has been closely tracking and documenting the country's COVID-19 impact. It was not a surprise to her that not all deaths were being counted. ""India systematically under-counts its deaths from other diseases as well,"" she told the ABC. ""In rural areas or among more marginalised communities, some deaths just never make it to [the] official record. So they don't get registered."" When COVID-19 struck, many states adopted different definitions of what it was, and a lack of testing meant some people died without being diagnosed. ""But none of this was active suppression or manipulation,"" Rukmini said. With the idea of herd immunity losing favour in India, a study out of South Africa could offer new hope about the hiIn India, the notion of ""herd immunity"", which lulled many into a false sense of security before Delta cases exploded last year, has disappeared from public discourse. As the second wave hit and cities were ""literally running out of space to cremate bodies"", it was clear that the officially reported figures were not matching those numbers, so local journalists and researchers began gathering their own data. They accessed state-level Civil Registration System (CRS) portals that count all deaths in a district for every month and were able to see an ""enormous spike"" that wasn't being reflected in the official toll. ""All of this seems to be in a sense validated by the WHO estimates,"" Rukmini said. Other independent assessments have put the death toll in India far higher than the government tally, including a report published in the journal Science in January which suggested 3 million people may have died of COVID-19 in the country. Another report from July last year — published by Arvind Subramanian, the Indian government's former chief economic adviser, and researchers at the not-for-profit Center for Global Development — also put deaths between 3.4 million to 4.7 million. It said the official count could have missed deaths that occurred in overwhelmed hospitals or while health care was disrupted. ""True deaths are likely to be in the several millions, not hundreds of thousands, making this arguably India's worst human tragedy since Partition and independence,"" the report said. The WHO process, which involved a panel of global experts convened jointly by the WHO and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), began in February 2021. The panel used a combination of national and local information, as well as statistical models, to estimate totals where the data was incomplete — a methodology India criticised. Since at least December 2021, the Indian government had been stalling the WHO's process by refusing to share data, Rukmini said. ""The government systematically pushed back … it promised to produce estimates of its own and did not. It has only now produced its annual estimates for 2020 on Tuesday — 48 hours before the WHO's scheduled release of its data."" Rukmini said she was informed by the WHO that India was the only country that had these objections. The WHO said it had not yet fully examined new data provided this week by India and might add a disclaimer to the report highlighting the ongoing conversation with the country. Much of the data used by the WHO comes from 18 states which represent 70 per cent of the Indian population. Despite the data coming from state-level portals, India argues it was ""obtained from some websites and media reports and was used in their mathematical model"". ""This reflects a statistically unsound and scientifically questionable methodology of data collection for making excess mortality projections in case of India,"" the health ministry said in a statement after the WHO's report was released. The government said only data from the Registrar General of India based on the Civil Registration System should be used for such estimations. Dozens of bodies wash up on the banks of a river in India as WHO warns Indian variant is of global concern. It has repeatedly defended its death registration system as being ""robust"", saying: ""Missing out on deaths is completely unlikely."" India has also rejected its classification as a ""Tier II"" country in terms of data availability. The WHO report classified countries into three tiers, which it said were statistical, not developmental, classifications. Steve MacFeely, director of data and analytics at the WHO, told an online forum last month that some countries had been upset by their tier placement. ""This doesn't say anything about the quality of the data in their country; what it talks about is the availability of that data,"" he said. ""If a country has good data but chooses not to make it available, then they are classified accordingly."" More than 60 per cent of countries don't register their deaths, Mr MacFeely said. Only 39 countries around the world produced what the WHO considered to be high-quality cause-of-death statistics. The WHO report revealed that 10 countries alone accounted for 68 per cent of all excess deaths: Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, Russia, South Africa, Turkey and the United States. Mr MacFeely said it was necessary to have the excess death estimates so the WHO could gain a broader measure of the impact of any crisis. Samira Asma, WHO assistant director-general for data, analytics and delivery for impact, who co-led the calculation process, said data was the ""lifeblood of public health"" needed to assess and learn from what happened during the pandemic. She called for more support for countries to improve reporting. ""Too much is unknown,"" she told reporters. Not only does the data allow for countries to better prepare for crises, in India's case Rukmini said it was important for people to get a sense of ""closure and validation"". ""There should be some sort of reckoning around what happened, particularly in the summer of 2021,"" she said. ""Some sort of validation to the families of people who lost their lives. There was this enormous wave of death and loss of life, much of which probably went under-counted."" ""The wounds are still fresh and it's dramatic for people to recall the circumstances under which we lost people …"" she added. ""I do think there needs to be some sort of conversation or reckoning around it. I do think people are owed that.""

19,"Boat capsizes near Puerto Rico, leaving at least 11 people dead",world,"  Suspected migrant boat capsizes near Puerto Rico, leaving at least 11 people dead For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A boat loaded with suspected migrants has capsized north of an uninhabited island near Puerto Rico, with 11 people confirmed dead and 31 others rescued, authorities say. It wasn't immediately clear how many people were aboard the boat when it turned over, said US Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad. He said a ""mass rescue effort"" was still underway. ""We're looking to rescue as many people as we can and find as many survivors as we can,"" he said. At least eight Haitians were taken to the hospital, although the nationalities of all those aboard the boat were not immediately known. The incident was the latest in a string of capsizings across the region as migrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republic flee violence and poverty in their countries. A US Customs and Border Protection helicopter spotted the overturned boat late on Thursday morning. ""If not for that, we would not have known about this until someone would have found any sign or received reports from people that their loved ones are missing,"" Mr Castrodad said. ""They found them early enough that we were able to coordinate a response."" The boat was spotted more than 18 kilometres north of the uninhabited island of Desecheo, which is off Puerto Rico's west coast. The US Coast Guard said those rescued were 20 men and 11 women. The capsizing comes less than a week after the US Coast Guard and Dominican navy on Saturday rescued 68 migrants in the Mona Passage, a treacherous area between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. One woman believed to be from Haiti died, Mr Castrodad said. ""These voyages are dangerous,"" Castrodad said. ""They're unsafe, they are grossly overloaded… [and] no lifesaving equipment. It wouldn't really take much for any of these vessels to capsize."" From October 2021 to March, 571 Haitians and 252 people from the Dominican Republic were detained in waters around Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, according to US Customs and Border Protection. The majority of those Haitians, 348 of them, landed in Puerto Rico's uninhabited Mona Island and were rescued. In fiscal year 2021, 310 Haitians and 354 Dominicans were detained, compared with the 22 Haitians and 313 Dominicans apprehended in fiscal year 2020. Meanwhile, the US Coast Guard said that in the fiscal year that ended September 30, it apprehended 1,527 Haitians, 838 Cubans and 742 people from the Dominican Republic in the region, which includes Florida and the Caribbean. Since then, trips of human smuggling boats have only increased, authorities say. In January, the Coast Guard searched for at least 38 people missing off Florida's coast after a suspected human smuggling boat that had left the Bahamas capsized in a storm. A sole survivor was reported. Hundreds of Haitians have arrived in Florida alone in recent months after swimming ashore. Haiti is struggling with a surge in gang-related violence that has killed dozens of people, including women and children, and caused thousands of families to flee their homes. Kidnappings also have spiked, including those of eight Turkish citizens who on Sunday were forced off a bus they had boarded in the Dominican Republic. Kidnappings in the country of more than 11 million people have increased 180 per cent and homicides are up 17 per cent in the past year, according to the United Nations, which last week expressed concern over ""the rapid deterioration of security and human rights"" in Haiti. Many have criticised the administration of US President Joe Biden for deporting more than 20,000 Haitians in recent months given the country's deepening turmoil.

20,"Boat capsizes near Puerto Rico, leaving at least 11 people dead",world,"  Suspected migrant boat capsizes near Puerto Rico, leaving at least 11 people dead For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A boat loaded with suspected migrants has capsized north of an uninhabited island near Puerto Rico, with 11 people confirmed dead and 31 others rescued, authorities say. It wasn't immediately clear how many people were aboard the boat when it turned over, said US Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad. He said a ""mass rescue effort"" was still underway. ""We're looking to rescue as many people as we can and find as many survivors as we can,"" he said. At least eight Haitians were taken to the hospital, although the nationalities of all those aboard the boat were not immediately known. The incident was the latest in a string of capsizings across the region as migrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republic flee violence and poverty in their countries. A US Customs and Border Protection helicopter spotted the overturned boat late on Thursday morning. ""If not for that, we would not have known about this until someone would have found any sign or received reports from people that their loved ones are missing,"" Mr Castrodad said. ""They found them early enough that we were able to coordinate a response."" The boat was spotted more than 18 kilometres north of the uninhabited island of Desecheo, which is off Puerto Rico's west coast. The US Coast Guard said those rescued were 20 men and 11 women. The capsizing comes less than a week after the US Coast Guard and Dominican navy on Saturday rescued 68 migrants in the Mona Passage, a treacherous area between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. One woman believed to be from Haiti died, Mr Castrodad said. ""These voyages are dangerous,"" Castrodad said. ""They're unsafe, they are grossly overloaded… [and] no lifesaving equipment. It wouldn't really take much for any of these vessels to capsize."" From October 2021 to March, 571 Haitians and 252 people from the Dominican Republic were detained in waters around Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, according to US Customs and Border Protection. The majority of those Haitians, 348 of them, landed in Puerto Rico's uninhabited Mona Island and were rescued. In fiscal year 2021, 310 Haitians and 354 Dominicans were detained, compared with the 22 Haitians and 313 Dominicans apprehended in fiscal year 2020. Meanwhile, the US Coast Guard said that in the fiscal year that ended September 30, it apprehended 1,527 Haitians, 838 Cubans and 742 people from the Dominican Republic in the region, which includes Florida and the Caribbean. Since then, trips of human smuggling boats have only increased, authorities say. In January, the Coast Guard searched for at least 38 people missing off Florida's coast after a suspected human smuggling boat that had left the Bahamas capsized in a storm. A sole survivor was reported. Hundreds of Haitians have arrived in Florida alone in recent months after swimming ashore. Haiti is struggling with a surge in gang-related violence that has killed dozens of people, including women and children, and caused thousands of families to flee their homes. Kidnappings also have spiked, including those of eight Turkish citizens who on Sunday were forced off a bus they had boarded in the Dominican Republic. Kidnappings in the country of more than 11 million people have increased 180 per cent and homicides are up 17 per cent in the past year, according to the United Nations, which last week expressed concern over ""the rapid deterioration of security and human rights"" in Haiti. Many have criticised the administration of US President Joe Biden for deporting more than 20,000 Haitians in recent months given the country's deepening turmoil.

21,Exporters accused of trying to smuggle cooking oil out of Indonesia as shipment seized,world,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Indonesia has impounded at least 81,000 litres of cooking oil bound for East Timor, as the government seeks to enforce a ban on exports of crude palm oil and its derivatives. At least eight shipping containers holding cooking oil and other items were confiscated at Tanjung Perak port on April 28 in Surabaya on the island of Java after the shipment ""deceived [authorities] by not listing cooking oil in the export declaration document"", the Trade Ministry said in a statement late on Thursday. Those found guilty of breaching the cooking oil export ban could face a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to 5 billion rupiah ($500,000), said Sihard Hadjopan Pohan, a Trade Ministry director. Officials did not name the ship nor the owner of the cargo. Indonesia, the world's biggest palm oil producer, late last month halted exports of crude palm oil as well as refined products in a bid to control soaring prices of cooking oil at home. The ban followed street protests where hundreds of students wearing neon jackets marched towards parliament last month. Police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowds. International buyers are left in the lurch as Indonesia makes a last-minute decision to expand a planned refined palm oil export ban to include other popular forms too. The export ban has rattled global vegetable oil markets that were already struggling after the war in Ukraine removed a big chunk of sunflower oil supply. Palm oil makes up more than a third of the world's vegetable oil market, while Indonesia accounts for around 60 per cent of palm oil supply. Chief Economics Minister Airlangga Hartarto has said the export ban would stay in place until bulk cooking oil prices dropped to 14,000 rupiah per litre across the country. As of Thursday, Trade Ministry data showed bulk cooking oil was being sold at 16,600 rupiah per litre.

22,The first snapshot of the cosmic monster in our galaxy opens up more questions than it answers,world," Science We've seen the black hole called Sagittarius A* at the middle of the Milky Way. Now what? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency There's a monster twirling around in the centre of our galaxy, and its portrait has finally been unveiled. Overnight, the international Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) crew revealed an image of superheated gas coursing around and falling into Sagittarius A* or Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the Milky Way's core. It's the culmination of five years of simulations and data crunching. And while it might look a bit like a glazed donut, there's more to the new image than meets the eye. For one, it tells us the black hole is 4 million times the mass of the Sun — a figure physicists suspected, but is now confirmed. The black hole's spinning too, but it’s skew-whiff — slightly tilted face-on to us. But despite this veritable goldmine of information about our galaxy's black hole, there's still plenty we're yet to discover. Well, for one, it's our supermassive black hole. ""It's home,"" said Jessica Dempsey, an Australian astrophysicist and member of the EHT team. We've now had a look at the supermassive black hole in the middle of the Milky Way. But how did we know it was there at all? ""That's why this one is special to a lot of people. The hunt to understand what is going on at the centre of our galaxy is hundreds of years old."" And while it may not be the biggest black hole, Sgr A*'s proximity means it's our best bet for understanding how it and its counterparts behave. ""As our instruments on the ground and in space improve our understanding, the Milky Way black hole is going to go a long way to unpacking general relativity, and how that works with quantum mechanics,"" said Dr Dempsey, former deputy director of the East-Asia Observatory in Hawaii. Understanding more about the Milky Way’s hefty heart can give clues as to how our galaxy formed. ""And maybe what we can learn from Sgr A* we can start to look for … in other galaxies,"" she said. One of the biggest ongoing questions in black hole physics is exactly how they collect, ingest and expel material orbiting them at near light speed in a process known as ""accretion"". After much hype and fanfare, we now know what the mega black hole in the centre of our galaxy looks like. This process is fundamental to the formation and growth of planets, stars and black holes of all sizes, throughout the universe. Despite the brightly spiralling gas and dust in the image, Sgr A* was not ""eating"" as much matter as the team had expected. ""If Sgr A* was a person, it would consume the equivalent of eating a grain of rice once every million years,"" said Michael Johnson, an astrophysicist at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. While some black holes can be remarkably efficient in converting gravitational energy into light, Sgr A* traps and hangs onto nearly all of this energy. ""It converts only one part in 1,000 into light,"" Dr Johnson said. And unlike the gargantuan black hole in the galaxy M87, an image of which was released in 2019, Sgr A* is not blasting an enormous jet of X-ray energy into space. But it might have a weak jet, Dr Dempsey said, based on as-yet unexplained peculiarities in how it rotates and accretes matter. If a jet is indeed there, the EHT can't yet see it, but research published late last year suggests a weak jet might be present. While the EHT was gazing at the black hole, three X-ray telescopes kept an eye on it too. They spotted X-ray flares — or outbursts — from Sgr A*. Signs of a jet? Perhaps. James Miller-Jones, an astrophysicist at Curtin University and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, said measuring the polarised light thrown off by the black hole's surroundings would tell us about its magnetic field. It's something the EHT team reported, last year, about M87. ""Sgr A* seems to have a strong, dynamically significant magnetic field, which means it's a magnetic field strong enough to affect the motion of the plasma around the black hole,"" Professor Miller-Jones said. ""It's going to be very interesting to look at that magnetic field structure and how that's influenced by the black hole, particularly given that it's spinning."" Alister Graham, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University of Technology, hoped to find out just how fast Sgr A*'s spin was. ""Black holes can spin at significant fractions of the speed of light, but I sensed [the EHT team] was unable to get an accurate read on this."" Another mystery that's yet to be solved is pinpointing the launch site of plasma jets that blew up the colossal twin bubbles in the Milky Way, he added. So how will we answer these questions? First, let's look at how astrophysicists managed to peek through a cosmic curtain of stars and gas to the black hole within our galaxy. Over a handful of nights in April 2017, when skies were clear, eight observatories from Antarctica to Europe simultaneously focused their gaze onto the centre of our galaxy, each tuned to record light with a wavelength of 1.3 millimetres. These are radio waves — invisible to our eyes, but spat out in abundance by the incredibly hot, turbulent gas swirling around and falling into the black hole, which produces the donut-like image. Because the EHT observatories were separated by vast distances, each telescope received the same radio signals from the Milky Way's centre at slightly different times. Each radio signal data point was ""stamped"" at its telescope by an atomic clock so precise that over the course of 100 million years, it would lose only a second. When it was time to combine the data, these time stamps let physicists synchronise the slew of signals and generate a sharper image. This linked-telescope technique, called Very Long Baseline Interferometry, essentially produces a telescope the size of the planet — and one with a resolution so high, it could, in theory, spot a ping pong ball on the surface of the Moon. So how can it be improved? Funny you should ask … The EHT has been training its radio-ready eyes on Sgr A* again — and on yet more objects — in the years since its first observations in 2017. More observatories have joined the EHT network since, which is already making a ""really huge"" difference, Dr Dempsey said. More ""eyes"" means the EHT can collect more light, increasing its sensitivity and its ability to spot fainter features. ""The more elements we bring in, the more sensitive we become, and the more certain we can be of fitting what we see … to the model,"" Dr Dempsey said. ""And the most critical part for Sgr A* is we can do those snapshots faster."" This means the team will eventually be able to take images on timescales they need to produce a movie that captures dynamic features such as the rotation of the black hole, and the gases tumbling around it. ""We really need to make a movie of our black hole to start to understand a lot of the questions [we still have],"" Dr Dempsey said. Already, the EHT has a spatial resolution some 5,000 times better than the Hubble Space Telescope, giving the EHT a ""whopping improvement"" in the ability to spy objects at vast distances, Professor Graham said. But to make out finer details, we'll need more telescopes. Not on Earth, though. ""Having a radio telescope in space will offer further gains in resolution, as will having one on the Moon,"" Professor Graham said. That's because the further apart the network's telescopes are, the better their spatial resolution is. Plans are afoot to send a 10-metre-wide radio telescope dish some 1.5 million kilometres into space, where the gravitational tug of Earth and the Sun will hold it in place. When incorporated into the Earth-based network, the telescope — called the Millimetron Space Observatory — should give the EHT a 150-fold improvement in resolution. The mission is led by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and is, so far, slated for launch in 2030. Tuning the EHT's radio dishes to pick up light of different wavelengths will give astrophysicists different representations of the black hole too. Detecting shorter wavelengths — less than a millimetre — should provide a sharper view through our galaxy's disc, Professor Miller-Jones said. Comparing the brightness of the black hole's gassy ring at different wavelengths — say, if it appears brighter in one wavelength than the other — could reveal some of its physical processes. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. ""With the next generation [EHT] facility, it will be very exciting to test our models of the environment around the black hole, and what we understand about the processes of how gas flows around it,"" Professor Miller-Jones said. ""All of that will be very, very interesting in the years to come."" So there will be, no doubt, plenty more never-before-seen insights into some of the most mysterious phenomena in the universe — including our galaxy's black hole. ""I personally love results that open up more questions than answers — and this [new image] is definitely one of those,"" Dr Dempsey said. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

23,Brooke Peris gives Hockeyroos the advantage in Trans-Tasman series against Black Sticks,world,"  Brooke Peris fires Hockeyroos to 2-1 win over New Zealand's Black Sticks to take series advantage For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Brooke Peris, cousin of Australian gold medallist Nova Peris, has pounced twice to edge the Hockeyroos past the Black Sticks 2-1 in the second game of their four-match Trans-Tasman Series in Auckland. Captaining the Australian women's hockey team in her 184th international, Peris scored in the first quarter and again in the last. Her goal three minutes from full-time decided the outcome after Olivia Shannon had drawn the home side level in the 39th minute. Hockeyroos coach Katrina Powell went in with the same 18 players who drew 2-2 in the opening match of the series on Tuesday, with Aleisha Power starting in goal in place of Jocelyn Bartram. Forced to come from behind in game one, the Hockeyroos found themselves ahead in the 13th minute on Thursday night's clash. A low, hard drag flick from Maddy Fitzpatrick from a penalty corner was blocked by goalkeeper Kirsten Nation and Peris was perfectly positioned to produce a world-class first-time strike. The play was delayed momentarily in the second quarter when Rosie Malone was struck in the wrist by a firmly-hit ball at close range, the midfielder in visible discomfort as she came from the field and she played no further part in the match. A piece of individual brilliance inside the attacking circle from Shannon in the 39th minute locked the scores up at 1-1. But it was the Hockeyroos who finished the game stronger and appeared the more likely to snatch a winner. Their reward came in the 57th minute when they took the ball from one side of the field to the other before Jane Claxton's ball into the circle bobbled off the stick of Black Sticks captain Megan Hull and bounced past teammate Ani Roberts allowing Peris to swoop and smash the ball home. Both the women's and men's hockey teams are in their final stages of preparation before the Commonwealth Games in August, with the Kookaburras aiming to secure their seventh straight gold medal. The Hockeyroos will also take part in the World Cup in July. Match three of the Trans-Tasman Series is on Saturday May 14 at 1.35pm AEST, while the final match of the series will take place at the same time on Sunday. All games are streamed live at LIVEHockey.

24,Trifle fit for a Queen unveiled as official pudding of Jubilee celebrations,world,"  Trifle fit for a Queen unveiled as official pudding of Platinum Jubilee celebrations For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A trifle has been unveiled as the official pudding of Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The winning dish was created as part of a special BBC program called The Jubilee Pudding: 70 Years in the Baking, with the Duchess of Cornwall announcing the winner. It is the latest in a line of dishes created for milestones in the monarch's 70-year reign. In 1953 two principal chefs of the Cordon Bleu cookery school in London created Coronation Chicken, the famed curried chicken salad, to celebrate her coming to the crown. This year's winning dessert was created by amateur baker and copywriter Jemma Melvin, who beat 5,000 entries with her lemon and Swiss roll amaretti trifle in the nationwide competition. The recipe on the BBC website includes layers of lemon curd and custard, St Clement's jelly, a mandarin coulis and amaretti biscuits. Ms Melvin said the dessert was inspired by the lemon posset served at the Queen's 1947 wedding to Prince Philip. The Queen, 96, is on course to become the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, which marks 70 years on the throne, next month. The celebrations will include street parties and other public events as well as the annual Trooping the Colour parade. Prince Andrew and Virigina Giuffre have reached a settlement in the civil case she brought against him. Here's what you need to know. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, plan to travel to the United Kingdom to attend the Jubilee celebrations with their children, Archie and Lilibet, but will not be taking part in the traditional Buckingham Palace balcony appearance. It will mark the couple's first public visit to the UK since they stepped down from their royal duties two years ago. The Queen's son Prince Andrew, who settled a sexual assault lawsuit in February, will also be missing from the balcony appearance, after stepping back from senior royal duties and being stripped of his honorary military titles. The Queen has recently been experiencing health issues and problems with her mobility. Earlier this week she was unable to attend the State Opening of Parliament and the reading of the Queen's speech for the first time in 59 years, sending her heir Prince Charles instead.
