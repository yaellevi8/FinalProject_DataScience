0,'Evil genius' may have caused Terra and Luna cryptocurrencies to crash in a 'death spiral',business,"  'Evil genius' may have caused Terra and Luna cryptocurrencies to crash in a 'death spiral' For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency It's been a stressful week for those who own bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as they watched billions of dollars get wiped off the value of their assets. Terra (UST) is a stablecoin, which is meant to be worth $US1 Its value is backed by a ""sister"" token called Luna Luna's value plunged 99pc, causing some investors to lose their life savings Bitcoin (which has often been touted as ""digital gold"" or a ""hedge against inflation"") plunged below $US25,500 this week — a far cry from the record high $US69,000 price tag it commanded back in November. The wider crypto market (which includes thousands of digital currencies and tokens) has seen its value plunge by more than 50 per cent since then. Lately, people have been dumping their riskier, speculative assets like crypto, tech stocks, and shares in companies which are still in their ""growth"" phase (and not paying dividends). It comes as the US Federal Reserve (and central banks globally) hike interest rates aggressively — and remove trillions of dollars worth of COVID-19 stimulus, in a desperate bid to keep a lid on decades-high inflation. Apart from those ""big picture"" economic factors, analysts say the crash of the TerraUSD ""stablecoin"" (or UST) — and its potential contagion effect — was the main reason behind this week's cryptocurrency sell-off. Stablecoins like UST, Tether and USDC are like bank accounts for the crypto ecosystem, and their value is usually pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar (on 1:1 basis). In theory, they're meant to have a fixed value (around $US1) so they can be a reliable store of value — in contrast to the extreme volatility of bitcoin, ethereum and others. Terra was one of the world's most valuable (and stable) digital currencies. But on Tuesday, a huge sell-off occurred as the value of the Terra stablecoin suddenly ""unpegged"" from the US dollar. Its value plunged from $US1 (where it was always meant to remain) to 60 US cents. Then it crashed again on Wednesday, bringing its value down to 20 US cents. It was the equivalent of a crypto ""bank run"", as people rushed to pull their money out. Most stablecoins are backed by cash reserves, and they're supposed to have enough liquid assets on hand to match the value of each coin. However, Terra (UST) is an “algorithmic” stablecoin — whose value is backed by a ""sister"" token called Luna, which is run on pre-programmed ""smart contracts"". Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices have surged to dizzying heights since their creation amid the global financial crisis. We explain what's driving this, along with the pros and cons. When Terra dips below $US1, it can be swapped for Luna tokens (at a small profit). In theory, that's meant to keep the value of both stable. It's basically like printing money out of thin air, through a complex mix of ""smart contracts"" — to make sure the value of each UST token stays as close as possible to $US1. But the problem was that these complex algorithms somehow failed spectacularly. Luna somehow crashed at the same time as UST, in what has been described by analysts as a ""death spiral"".  Essentially, investors rushed to liquidate their digital assets quicker than the ""algorithmic"" stabiliser could take effect. The price of the ""sister"" token dropped from about $US86 at the start of this week, to just 0.003 US cents on Friday. In other words, Luna has collapsed (and lost nearly all its value) in a very short amount of time. Investors suffered unprecedented losses as Luna's market value plummeted from $US40 billion to about $US500 million, which led to a sell-off and crisis of confidence across the wider cryptocurrency market. Nobody knows who caused the price of Terra and Luna to crash. But many on social media are pointing the blame at the big US hedge funds and trading firms, given the massive trades involved. BlackRock and Citadel Securities have issued statements denying any involvement in Terra's crash. ""We don't know if the momentum was created by collusion,"" said Lisa Wade, the CEO of blockchain company DigitalX. ""Conspiracy theorists would say 'yes', because it's a massive trade. I mean, in all of my career, it's one of the biggest trades that I've seen,"" she told ABC's The Business. ""It's almost like an evil genius plot, because there are a lot of steps to it."" Ms Wade said, as part of this complex plot, the buyers appear to have purchased around $1 billion worth of UST stablecoins, while ""shorting"" bitcoin (which is a risky way to make money, by betting on the price of an asset falling — instead of rising). ""What they did next was they timed the market. ""So obviously we're in a really volatile risk-off stage of the market — because of everything that's been happening with the [US] Fed and the macro environment. ""They waited until a Saturday night when [trading] volumes were very low, and there were no bids. ""And then they went into a trading pool and started selling UST in massive volumes, which then triggered all of the subsequent selling in a low-volume market that broke the [US dollar] peg. ""Inside the algorithm was what our team had identified as a 'death spiral' ... the selling starts to feed on itself from the mechanics of the algorithm. ""So when the death spiral kicked in ... the algorithm started selling Bitcoin and Avalanche [another cryptocurrency], which triggers more selling. ""Luna was impacted because it's the underlying [backer] of the UST. So every time a UST [token] is bought, a Luna [token] is burnt, which means there's less tokens in supply, so the Luna price goes up. ""The reverse applies when people start selling. So every time someone sells a UST, they mint a Luna, which means there's more volume. ""And if there's no buyers and the price goes down, then it starts to feed on itself, because people start panicking and selling Luna. ""This was an exploitative trade that took advantage of the fact that markets are weaker. The perfect storm was nobody stepping up to buy the bitcoin and the UST"". Unfortunately, there is a human cost to the failure of the Terra stablecoin. A long list of suicide prevention hotlines can be seen at the top of the TerraLuna Reddit page — including Australia's LifeLine, and similar organisations from the United States, Britain, Spain, China, Sweden, and 90 other countries. Many Reddit users have also posted stories about the consequences of losing their money from their Terra and Luna cryptocurrency investments. ""I lost all my life savings,"" one user wrote. ""Had bought Luna at $85, not sure what to do."" ""I should've cashed out when it was $100, then I would have been up $25,000,"" Reddit user No-Forever wrote. ""But I got greedy hoping to get more money so I can at least afford a downpayment for a house for my family. I guess no house and savings then."" Reserve Bank deputy governor Michelle Bullock said that, while crypto markets were still too small to threaten overall financial stability, the volatility and losses for small investors were a concern. ""The crypto world is causing problems for everyone at the moment,"" she told a FINSIA lunch of financial professionals. ""That's an innovative area where everyone's just a little nervous about potential implications, particularly for consumers."" ""What upsets me is that I can look at it through a trader's lens and be clinical and analyse the trade,"" Ms Wade said. ""However, on the other side of that are mums and dads. ""The reason why UST was worth $US18 billion was because it was backed by a savings pool. ""That savings pool was offering 20 per cent returns. So lots of innocent people had their money saved up in their thinking they were getting risk-free deposits."" While Ms Wade said this kind of trading wasn't illegal, the ethics of it were ""questionable"", and she believes it will likely lead to regulation in the crypto markets being fast-tracked. Terra's backers are currently trying to raise about $US1.5 billion to boost the value of the stablecoin, and restore its parity with the US dollar — with little success so far. But the concern amongst anxious investors is that: if the value of a supposedly ""stable"" digital asset can be wiped out so easily in a few days, who else is next in the crypto firing line?

1,"ASX defies Wall Street downer, as crypto struggles and $A falls",business,"  ASX defies Wall Street downer, as crypto struggles and $A falls For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Australian share market is ending the week on a high despite global markets still struggling with looming rate hikes, war and inflation. The ASX 200 opened higher and, by 11am AEST, it was up 1.4 per cent, to 7,039. And the All Ords was up a similar amount. That positive mood continued, with the ASX 200 eventually finished up 1.9per cent, at 7,075. The All Ords was up even more, at 2 per cent, helping it regain the heavy losses it had during the week. All the major sectors were in the green. The top-performing stocks were Life360 (+13.4 per cent) and Polynovo (+12.7 per cent). However, over the past five days, the benchmark has still lost 1.81 per cent. The Dow Jones closed 0.3 per cent down, while the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent lower. However, the Dow Jones had recovered some losses during late trade. The Nasdaq was marginally up, by 0.1 per cent. That's after the tech sector has suffered heavy losses off the back of higher-than-expected inflation data out of the US. Crypto is still struggling, but Bitcoin has recovered a slice of what it lost yesterday. By 4:30pm, it was back above the benchmark $US30,000. The devastating effects of the crash of crypto ""stablecoins"" Terra and Luna are being felt by many but their crash may have been orchestrated in one massive piece of ethically questionable trading. This is as investors say that people are putting their cash back into the safe haven of the American currency. The Australian currency was also down. As the ANZ noted this morning: ""The AUD is firmly below 69 US cents as global equities resumed their decline overnight. Pressure remains to the downside for the AUD."" Meanwhile, there's speculation that Europe will soon increase rates. Inflation is also a problem in countries there, with the shortage of gas especially putting pressure on economies. ""In Europe, we have recently revised up our inflation forecasts and anticipate the [European Central Bank] will hike rates in July,"" ANZ noted.

2,'We have a lot of fat that can feed a wage increase': Economists disagree over minimum pay rise,business,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Wages have become the latest battleground in the election, with debate raging about how much extra workers can get paid without sending businesses broke and consumer prices soaring. On one side, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) is proposing a lift in minimum and award wages of up to 3 per cent. ""Business is doing it tough. They've had two years of pandemic where they've struggled to keep people in their jobs,"" ACCI chief executive Andrew McKellar told RN Breakfast. On the other is the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), which is calling for a 5.5 per cent pay increase for the 2.3 million workers covered by awards or the minimum wage. ""Businesses are not just recovering, they're recovering very well,"" ACTU secretary Sally McManus said. ""The bigger risk is that a whole heap of people, i.e. the one in four workers that are on the minimum wage [or awards], their real wages go backwards, because that means you'll have less to spend in businesses because they depend on consumer spending."" In June, the Fair Work Commission will make its determination about how much extra those workers should get in their pay packets from July 1. The latest political controversy is whether the federal government should make a submission calling for a specific wage increase. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has been criticised by the government for saying it should at least match inflation, currently 5.1 per cent. ""No Australian government or opposition has ever put a figure on the rate of the annual wage increase and yet Mr Albanese today has done just that,"" Finance Minister Simon Birmingham said. However, Professor John Buchanan from the University of Sydney's Workplace Research Centre said that is incorrect. ""If you look back at over 100 years of wages policy, governments have usually put in a clear statement of what they think the state of the economy is and what the quantum of the wage increase should be,"" he told ABC News Channel. ""It's only in the very recent past that the federal government has basically squibbed it and just put a whole lot of data in front of the commission and hasn't made a call on what the final number should be."" ACCI's Mr McKellar said he did not have a problem with the government putting a figure on the minimum wage rise. Both major political parties go into next month's election agreeing about the need to improve real wages, but it is almost impossible to deliver, writes business editor Ian Verrender. ""They've got every right to,"" he said. ""They've got many analysts at their disposal, many good economists, I think it's entirely reasonable for government to pull up that data and information together and express a view about what is supported by the facts."" Whether the government puts a specific recommendation before the commission or not, in the end the commissioners will make the final call. Economist Steven Hamilton from George Washington University, currently a visiting fellow at ANU, said the commission was likely to agonise over its difficult decision. ""We should remember that the minimum wage case is ultimately a value judgement,"" he told ABC News. ""It's not actually just about economics. It's also about people's welfare. ""And I think being explicit about that is really important."" Professor Buchanan said it is a critical judgement, not just for those on the minimum wage and awards, but because it feeds through to pay expectations in the community more broadly. ""That notion of a community norm has a very big influence, and when setting that community norm, it listens very closely to the arguments of unions, employers, but fundamentally governments are regarded as a key player in the game,"" he said. So what are the key economic issues and values that will shape this key judgement? Alison Pennington, senior economist at the Centre for Future Work with The Australia Institute, said the minimum wage increase must be higher than inflation, or low-paid workers would effectively be taking a pay cut. ""The ACTU's proposal of 5.5 per cent lift is entirely reasonable in the context of both the COVID pandemic shock and this inflation shock,"" she said. Ms Pennington pointed to New Zealand, which is experiencing slightly higher inflation than Australia, and recently decided on a 6 per cent increase for minimum wage earners. ""Australia needs real wage increases. That's the short of it,"" she said. ""Workers in this time can't be expected to cop declining real wages, higher prices and higher interest rates."" The Reserve Bank wants you to believe it has inflation under control. Gareth Hutchens asks: ""Do you believe it?"" Dr Hamilton has a different point of view and argued a wage rise of between 4 and 4.5 per cent is a good middle ground for this year, but with the promise of similar wage rises for at least a couple more years. ""I believe we should not deliver a wage increase for 2.3 million Australians on minimum wage and awards of more than the current CPI [Consumer Price Index]. That's my judgement,"" he said. ""Instead, what I think is a more sensible change is being able to commit to... an above-inflation increase in the following two years. So, in a sense, to sort of smooth out the wage impact over time."" Ms McManus said without a real wage rise more workers would consider strike action. Transport workers, teachers, nurses and aged care workers have recently gone on strike for better pay and conditions. ""It's all because employers are still insisting on real wage cuts and people are suffering."" she said. ""When I say suffering, they can't pay the rent — rents for a lot of people have gone up $100 a week and, if you're on low wages, $45,000 a year, you can't afford that."" Mr McKellar said people deserve and need a pay rise, just not one that worsens inflation. ""We've got to see a situation where interest rates don't go up by more than another 1 or 2 per cent in the next 12 months."" Some economists are concerned that a bigger wage increase might result in a so-called wage price spiral. This is a feedback loop, and occurs when increasing wages push up business costs, which are then passed on in rising consumer prices, and so on. Dr Hamilton said this may cause the Reserve Bank to hike the cash rate faster and to a higher peak. The Reserve Bank's latest economic forecasts differ wildly from Treasury's latest budget numbers, which are barely a month old. ""We kind of don't know the equilibrium interest rate necessary to arrest that kind of spiral. And so there is a chance that that interest rate is really high,"" Dr Hamilton said. ""And it could be there's some potential that the interest rate increases sufficiently high that it it reduces employment."" He said, in an extreme case, interest rates might have to rise so high to contain inflation that they cause the economy to shrink into a recession. On the other hand, Dr Hamilton said if wages persistently failed to keep pace with price rises that would dent consumer demand and could also trigger an economic downturn. ""There's risks on both sides. Too high and too low,"" he added. Ms Pennington disagreed with the idea that inflation would worsen if minimum wage workers get a real pay rise. The argument that wages will grow when unemployment is lower is refuted in a new report by some of Australia's leading industrial relations experts. ""Real wages have declined by 2 per cent in the last 12 months, and that brings us back to 2014 levels,"" she observed. ""Unless wages are outpacing productivity, there's no case to be made that real wage increases will drive up inflation."" Ms Pennington said there was a ""scare campaign with claims of wage price spirals based on 1970s institutions"". ""For a wage price spiral to occur there would need to be higher levels of unionisation and stronger mechanisms for awarding wage increases,"" she argued. Professor Buchanan and Ms Pennington do not think so, and they think bosses can afford a pay rise as a result. ""The average Australian worker now is producing about 50 per cent more than they did 30 years ago for the same amount of effort,"" Professor Buchanan said. ""Most of that productivity gain has gone to business and this is something that those key international organisations have identified as a fundamental problem."" Ms Pennington said profit share of GDP was around post-World War Two record highs. ""When people claim that any increase in labour costs will necessarily mean higher prices, they're assuming that the constant is the company's profit rate,"" she said. ""But we have a lot of fat that can feed a wage increase."" Australians' real incomes have barely increased in the past seven years, but one leading economist says COVID-19's halt to immigration may provide a silver lining for workers who haven't seen a pay rise in years. But Dr Hamilton warned that wages are normally rigid — meaning they rarely fall, even in response to a drop in demand for workers. He said that means that if current supply disruptions are the key cause of inflation at the moment and price rises are temporary, higher wage rises might end up locking in uncompetitive labour costs. ""This is kind of why you want the wage regime to look through the short term shock, and why I would be a little cautious about overdoing it in the short run,"" he said. ""Because what happens is, when the supply shock is gone, basically the minimum wage is too high and you'll end up with an effect on employment.""

3,The reality was stark for Donna and Jarrod — get second jobs or fail to get ahead,business,"  Cost of living forces record number of Australians into second jobs to stay afloat For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A record number of Australians are working in multiple jobs to make ends meet as the rising cost of living bites into already stretched household budgets, according to job figures. Victorian mother-of-two Donna Hawker says she realised about five months ago that her family wasn't ""getting anywhere"" financially and that she would need to take on a second job. ""I thought it's better to try and have another job and try and get ahead and save some sort of money,"" she said. The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show the Hawkers are among a growing number of people juggling multiple jobs to keep up with the cost of living. An estimated 867,000 Australians were working in more than one job in the December quarter — more than at any other time since the bureau started keeping such records in 1994. Ms Hawker, who lives in Avoca, a small town just over two hours' drive north-west of Melbourne, works a couple of days a week as a disability support worker and recently took on extra work at an after-school care program. Mr Hawker also has two jobs, as a relief teacher and a casual farm hand. The couple has found it harder, financially, since Mr Hawker was forced to give up his shearing job six months ago due to wear and tear on one of his shoulders. Ms Hawker said the family lived modestly and tried to cut costs where it could. ""We don't smoke or drink, we don't go out for tea, we have probably takeaway once a fortnight, so that's our way of trying to save a bit more money, [and] I try to walk to the shops in town,"" she said. Impact Economics and Police lead economist Angela Jackson said the increasing number of Australians working multiple jobs suggested more people were probably struggling to find secure, full-time work. ""We have seen over the past 12 months the average hours worked across the economy go up,"" Dr Jackson said. ""That reflects the fact that real wages have been going down and so people have had to work more hours to make ends meet."" Dr Jackson said the increasing cost of housing was another big factor causing many people financial stress. ""We're seeing rents up particularly in regional areas,"" she said. Data released by CoreLogic this week shows the portion of income required to pay rent in the regions now sits at 34 per cent nationally, higher even than in the capital cities, where people are handing over an average of 28 per cent of their income to landlords. Disability support worker Elizabeth Naughton said she had to live in a mobile home at Deuchar, two hours south-west of Brisbane, due to high rental costs. ""The rent prices up here are ridiculous, so I rent just a small mobile home, cheaply, but it lacks running water,"" she said. ""It doesn't have a shower and a toilet — I have to use that down at the main house on the property."" Ms Naughton said she had been juggling multiple jobs for several years. She works two 24-hour shifts a week as a disability support worker, earning about $580 a shift. Her work involves staying overnight at her clients' homes. She also works one day a week drafting cattle at the local saleyards. Ms Naughton said she felt cost-of-living pressures in many areas. ""I have a lot of pets, some of them are aged, so that factors into the cost of living a bit,"" she said. She said high fuel prices had hit her hard. Julie Williams lost her job in January just as supply shortages hit supermarkets, and fuel started to rise. ""It's just ridiculous now, I don't go anywhere, unless it's to work and I try to do what I've got to do in town while I'm there, so I don't have to make any extra trips,"" she said. ""Fresh produce has gone up a bit, so I basically just live off frozen vegetables. She said she could get a month's worth of meals for less than $100 if she bought some meat and used frozen vegetables and a bag of potatoes. ""There are heaps of people out there struggling and I don't even know what the government could do if they were willing to do anything,"" she said.

4,"Cost blowouts across WA as rising prices, labour shortages impact the budget's bottom line",business,"  Billion-dollar infrastructure budget blowout highlights impact of labour, supplies shortages For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The WA Government will spend almost $1 billion, and possibly more, to deal with cost blowouts and delays on its infrastructure projects over the next few years. While there has been plenty of attention on the rapidly rising costs and shortages of labour and supplies to build new homes in Perth, the WA budget handed down on Thursday laid bare how badly these problems in the construction market are hurting the state's own projects. For example, the WA Government will inject almost $380 million over the next three years to deal with cost escalations and supply chain problems in its signature rail infrastructure program Metronet. Experts say building grants have had 'unintended consequences' for those trying to navigate Perth's overheated construction market. This money will go towards the new Thornlie-Cockburn rail line and the extension of the Joondalup line to Yanchep. The budget papers also stated the rail line to Perth Airport, slated to be finished by the end of 2020, would now open sometime this year. Some of the biggest cost blowouts are in the regions, especially in the mid west where the labour market is particularly stretched and hundreds of residents affected by Cyclone Seroja are waiting for work to be done on their homes and businesses. The Geraldton regional hospital expansion has blown out by $50 million, bringing its total cost to more than $122 million. Cost blowouts and delays have hurt the delivery of mental health facilities in Karratha and Broome, with the two step-up, step-down facilities set to cost a combined $3.9 million extra. The WA Government will put an extra $80 million towards the Bunbury Outer Ring road, pushing its cost to $1.25 billion, to deliver a scaled-back version of the south west's biggest road project. The budget also revealed the $250 million Pinjarra bypass road will take a back seat, with no significant work until 2025. Some key tourism projects – such as a new café and function centre at Perth Zoo, as well upgraded water infrastructure on Rottnest Island – will get multi-million dollar cash injections to deal with increased construction costs. The WA Government has also planned for construction cost blowouts in other areas of spending, including: But the budget also revealed the WA Government has set aside $350 million just in case there are further blowouts of construction costs. As the budget papers outline, there are many reasons for the ""cost escalation and supply chain constraints"" which are dramatically affecting its big infrastructure projects. These include: These problems appear to be affecting all parts of the economy, with the budget papers showing business investment only grew by 4.75 per cent, compared with a predicted 9.75 per cent, in 2021-22. ""Labour shortages and supply chain disruptions have resulted in some delays to investment spending, particularly for smaller non-mining businesses,"" the budget papers said. This budget was finalised on April 11, weeks before the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed Perth had the highest inflation in the country at 7.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Western Australia's reliance on China remains the cornerstone of the state's riches. While WA Treasury uses a different way of calculating inflation for its projections, the budget showed a 4 per cent growth in 2021-22, after five years of only growing an average of 1 per cent. ""Price pressures have accelerated in recent months, due to high global oil prices and supply chain disruptions from Omicron outbreaks (particularly in New South Wales and Victoria), as well as adverse weather events, such as flooding that caused the temporary closure of the east-west rail route between 21 January and 15 February 2022,"" the budget paper said.

5,"Tax office threat to name and shame companies works, as ATO gets back into collecting debt",business,"  Australian Taxation Office resumes chasing small business debts as COVID holiday ends For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Public and media pressure stopped the tax office going harder in pursing debts owed by small businesses struggling through the COVID pandemic, previously secret internal documents have revealed. It comes ahead of an expected rising wave of companies going under, as the Australian Taxation Office chases debts it has not pursued since early 2020. The reports, obtained using the Freedom of Information (FOI) process, reveal a softer approach of sending text messages, sending blue rather than ""firmer"" orange letters and a move away from ""stronger action"" in ""favour (of) help and assistance"" for small business. As the ATO lauded its new approach to small business debt in October 2021, in a report headed ""Context"", it urged staff to understand why. ""The ATO is aware that the small business market has been one of the most affected groups during COVID-19 and the associated lockdowns. Media and community sentiment have reflected on both the support for and fragility of this market segment and the ATO has been proud of its role supporting small businesses through the stimulus measures,"" the document said. ""During COVID and the associated lockdowns we moved our focus away from stronger and firmer action in favour of help and assistance and enhanced engagement work with clients to resolve or manage their debt."" The scale of the problem is massive. As of August 31, 2021, the tax office had issued 842,845 reminder letters, with around 55 per cent of them going to small business. At the time of contacting the ATO for this article, it had sent out letters warning about outstanding debts to 29,552 businesses. A further 52,319 letters warning about the potential for Director Penalty Notices (DPNs) were sent to people in charge of these companies. ""These programs are focused on those who have not responded to our calls and letters – and have significant tax obligations outstanding,"" an ATO spokesperson said. In the FOI documents, leaders told staff: ""We also note that there is a significant concern in the community that many businesses were completely reliant on the stimulus measures during COVID and as they are removed and reduced these businesses may not be able to overcome the trading disruption of the pandemic and will be unviable."" The tax office isn't waiting around for the money to come in. A threat to dob companies with tax debts to credit reporting agencies – which could cause that company's clients to stop doing business with them – has worked. ""The purpose of the disclosure is to support other businesses to make informed decisions about who they are doing business with. The outcome we are seeking is behavioural change and engagement rather than actual disclosure,"" the document reads, outlining the gambit. ""The program has been very successful. We commenced in August this year, and to 30 September have issued 70 notices of intention to disclose to clients. ""As a result of their engagement, we have made no disclosures and 69 clients have re-engaged with us in managing total debt worth $6.5 million."" But a softer approach is notable, particularly after ABC reports that exposed brutal treatment of taxpayers in dispute with the ATO. In the previously secret documents, the tax office outlines its new pandemic-inspired approach. ""Throughout COVID, the ATO paused its firmer and stronger actions, instead looking to re-engage with help and assistance whilst businesses managed the effects of the lockdowns,"" it reads. ""The number of early intervention (blue) letters has continued to increase from previous years as we continue to engage with Small Businesses throughout the bushfires and COVID-19 offering help and assistance. ""Over this same period, however, the number of letters with a firmer tone (orange letters) has reduced, instead reverting to lighter touch blue letters.""

6,Exporters accused of trying to smuggle cooking oil out of Indonesia as shipment seized,business,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Indonesia has impounded at least 81,000 litres of cooking oil bound for East Timor, as the government seeks to enforce a ban on exports of crude palm oil and its derivatives. At least eight shipping containers holding cooking oil and other items were confiscated at Tanjung Perak port on April 28 in Surabaya on the island of Java after the shipment ""deceived [authorities] by not listing cooking oil in the export declaration document"", the Trade Ministry said in a statement late on Thursday. Those found guilty of breaching the cooking oil export ban could face a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to 5 billion rupiah ($500,000), said Sihard Hadjopan Pohan, a Trade Ministry director. Officials did not name the ship nor the owner of the cargo. Indonesia, the world's biggest palm oil producer, late last month halted exports of crude palm oil as well as refined products in a bid to control soaring prices of cooking oil at home. The ban followed street protests where hundreds of students wearing neon jackets marched towards parliament last month. Police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowds. International buyers are left in the lurch as Indonesia makes a last-minute decision to expand a planned refined palm oil export ban to include other popular forms too. The export ban has rattled global vegetable oil markets that were already struggling after the war in Ukraine removed a big chunk of sunflower oil supply. Palm oil makes up more than a third of the world's vegetable oil market, while Indonesia accounts for around 60 per cent of palm oil supply. Chief Economics Minister Airlangga Hartarto has said the export ban would stay in place until bulk cooking oil prices dropped to 14,000 rupiah per litre across the country. As of Thursday, Trade Ministry data showed bulk cooking oil was being sold at 16,600 rupiah per litre.

7,The dollar is down below 69 US cents. That means one thing to the market — and it's not good news,business,"  As the Aussie dollar falls against the US dollar, more economic pressure looms for households For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Australian dollar has become a little unpopular of late. In April it was trading above 75 US cents, but this week it's fallen below 70 US cents. For currency market watchers, that's a sizeable move in just a couple of months. On Thursday, it slipped towards 68 US cents (68.82 US cents at 3.30pm AEST). It's now close to where it settled during the pandemic-induced financial crisis. As professional investor Danielle Ecuyer tweeted, ""AUD under US0.69 — risk off, risk off, risk off"". That's market jargon for ""sell, sell, sell"". The sharp fall in the Australian dollar coincided with another broad and sharp sell-off on the Australian Stock Exchange. But it's the dollar that's likely to put pressure on every Australian hip pocket nerve. The lower the dollar falls, the more upwards pressure it will put on inflation and, of course, the cost of living. That's because the dollar in your pocket doesn't go as far when you're buying something made overseas. So just how much extra pressure is it likely to add to already squeezed household budgets? The fear at this juncture is that the Australian dollar has further to fall. There are several forces putting downward pressure on the value of the Australian dollar versus the US dollar. They include concerns about how the ongoing pandemic will influence China's economic growth and therefore its demand for Australia's commodities, like iron ore. The stronger China's demand for iron ore, coal and gas, the more interest there is in Australian dollars. Also, the US Federal Reserve is in the process of raising interest rates, and potentially quite aggressively. The higher US interest rates go, relative to Australian interest rates, the more demand there is for US dollars, and the less demand for Australian dollars and the value of our currency falls. The Aussie dollar is also negatively affected by poor market sentiment, or pessimism about the global economy. And this is being made worse by the prospect of rising global interest rates. Westpac's currency strategist Sean Callow says, in the short term, the local currency is likely to drop to 68 US cents – roughly where it was in June 2020. There is no telling whether it will go up or down from there. Just about every Australian feels the impact of a rising and falling dollar. Business owners feel the pain when the cost of purchasing equipment sourced from overseas rises. On the flip side, their exports become cheaper and more competitive. Households feel the effects when they go shopping and realise the goods they purchase have risen in cost. Travellers also feel the hip pocket nerve when they go to exchange their dollars for greenbacks, and realise they've received less than they expected. Economists, though, consider anything below 75 US cents to be favourable for exporters. Yet the lower the dollar falls the less purchasing power shoppers have — that's where it hurts many of us day-to-day. The lower dollar comes at a time when consumers are feeling, well, quite miserable actually. The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index fell by 0.2 per cent last week to a 20-month low of 90.5 points. Consumer views on whether it is a good 'time to buy a major household item' dropped 2.2 per cent in the past week to a 2-year low of -15.9 points. And the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment fell by 5.6 per cent to 90.4 in May. The Index is now at its lowest level since August 2020. Business conditions and profitability are doing nicely thank you very much, but confidence among bosses isn't all that crash hot at the moment. Business confidence, as measured by the National Australia Bank (NAB), eased in April. So, realistically, at what level against the US dollar is the Australian dollar likely to hurt your family budget? ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch says it's difficult to quantify the level but that the dollar would need to fall further and stay there for a considerable period of time, for it to put upward pressure on inflation and the cost of living. The share market is screaming a message right now: The economy is not OK. And the ramifications will hit all of us. The NAB's chief economist is optimistic the Australian dollar won't do any damage to household budgets. ""[The dollar would need to fall a] long way and lags typically 12 months-to-two years,"" Alan Oster says. Forecasting precisely where the dollar will go is fraught with risk, and difficult to predict. However real wages are not expected to increase for another couple of years, and that's before considering the affects of a falling dollar on consumers' purchasing power. If the currency tide turns against the dollar and it falls significantly further, it will weigh heavily on every household budget in the country. An aggressive Reserve Bank monetary policy tightening program (raising interest rates) would help stem the tide, but that would also create further headaches for households. You could be forgiven for thinking you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't in this economic climate.

8,"Taxpayers paid nearly $20 million leasing Darwin Port to Chinese company under Morrison's watch, Labor says",business,"  Labor accuses Scott Morrison of 'encouraging' Darwin Port lease with nearly $20 million incentive payment For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Documents released by Labor show Scott Morrison signed off on a federal agreement to pay almost $20 million to the Northern Territory government as part of an incentive program for privatising the Darwin Port. The agreement was reached six months after the NT Country Liberal government leased the facility to Chinese company Landbridge in 2015, under a 99-year deal worth $506 million. Labor has used the documents to accuse the Prime Minister, who was treasurer at the time, of offering a financial ""sweetener"" to get the controversial deal done. ""Rather than dissuade the Territory government not to lease this port, Scott Morrison instead provided $19 million to the government in the event that they did go ahead,"" Labor's defence spokesman Brendan O'Connor said. ""Now, that is a mistake that should not have happened. ""They should have been working hard and furiously to prevent it from happening."" The Prime Minister has maintained the port deal was the sole responsibility of the CLP government and that there was nothing he could have done to prevent it. The controversial lease Darwin Port remains in the spotlight amid China’s new security pact with Solomon Islands. So, how and why did it happen? ""The federal government had absolutely no authority over that sale whatsoever,"" Mr Morrison said during last weekend's leaders' debate. But Mr O'Connor said Mr Morrison had actively encouraged the deal through the Commonwealth's asset recycling scheme. The scheme offered a 15 per cent bonus for state and territory governments that privatised existing assets and reinvested funds into new public infrastructure. News reports following the 2016 federal budget show the Commonwealth intended to provide a total of $40 million as part of the scheme for the Territory's long-term lease of the port, as well as its sale of the Territory Insurance Office. Labor has now released a government document from May that year which shows Mr Morrison signed an agreement that included $19.5 million specifically for the port deal. The National Partnership Agreement on Asset Recycling, which was also signed by the then NT treasurer David Tollner, required the NT government to invest $130.5 million in a new ship lift facility and an electricity project. The federal contribution was revised down to $18.5 million as part of an updated agreement which was signed by then treasurer Josh Frydenberg and then NT treasurer Nicole Manison in 2019. When the port lease was signed, it received the all clear from national security agencies, and it also fell below the threshold for the Foreign Investment Review Board to scrutinise it. However, the deal has continued to cause controversy amid the increasingly degraded relationship between the Australian and the Chinese governments. With a federal election set for May 21, Mr O'Connor said the documents showed the port deal was mishandled under Mr Morrison's watch. ""Scott Morrison signs off on an agreement … effectively provid(ed) a sweetener, encouragement, incentive to the then Country Liberal Northern Territory and government to lease this port for almost a century,"" he said. ""And the fact that they have done that, and the fact that the Prime Minister Scott Morrison has not apologised, or at least made clear he regrets that decision is really, really a matter of character."" A recent national security review of the port lease has not been publicly released, however in February the Prime Minister said he had received no advice to take steps to revoke the arrangement. Mr O'Connor said Labor would review national security advice about the port lease if it wins government. The ABC has requested comment from the Coalition.

9,Clive Palmer's party is proposing a mortgage cap that would take Australia's banking system back to the 1970s,business,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency With the cost of living surging and interest rates rising for the first time in more than a decade, a cap on mortgage repayments would come as welcome relief for millions of borrowers. But can it be done and who would end up paying for it? Clive Palmer's United Australia Party (UAP) has been spruiking a 3 per cent, five-year cap on mortgage interest rates as the centrepiece of its election campaign. It has featured in a large share of the UAP's $16 million worth of ads on Google and YouTube since the election was called, as well as on billboards and TV ads that are expected to push the party's total campaign advertising spend to $40 million. But how would it work? Details of the policy are scarce, and come from media questions to the party's leader Craig Kelly and Queensland Senate candidate Clive Palmer. At his National Press Club appearance in April, Mr Palmer talked about regulating interest rates. ""I think we can legislate to limit home loans because if you look back in the [19]60s and the '70s, that's how the interest rates operated in this country,"" he said. In this comment, Mr Palmer is correct, according to Lowy Institute senior fellow and former Reserve Bank board member Dr John Edwards. ""We used to cap everything,"" he told The Business. ""We capped mortgage rates, importantly we also capped deposit rates, because if you cap mortgage rates, you also have to cap deposit rates."" Former Commonwealth Bank chief economist Michael Blythe, who now runs PinPoint Macro Analytics, also remembers the era well. ""The RBA used to have control over the mortgage rate, and they could tell banks how much they could lend for various purposes,"" he recalled. ""In fact, control over the mortgage rate persisted until 1986."" Why did this system end? Because there were problems. Serious ones. First of all, interest rates for much of this era were not low. They were often in the double-digits. That is because inflation was also often out of control (more on this later). And if you think it is hard getting a home loan now, try going back four decades. ""First of all, you'd beg some of it from a bank and, reluctantly, they'd give you some, but you had to get more to actually buy a house,"" said Dr Edwards, who bought his first home during the period. ""In those days, lawyers used to act as lenders for their clients. ""Often a real estate agent would say, 'look, we can get the rest of this money from a lawyer's office', but it'd be a higher rate and a shorter term."" Michael Blythe explained that the banks were reluctant to lend money because the flow of funds used to back those loans was very volatile. With deposit rates for the regulated banks capped, non-bank lenders could come in and capture savings by offering much higher returns. ""A shortage of funds meant that home loans could be 'rationed',"" he said. ""In practice it seems borrowers got part of their home loans at the regulated rate from the bank, then had to go around the corner to the bank [owned] finance company to borrow the rest at market rates."" Monash University economics lecturer and former Reserve Bank economist Zac Gross summed up the dilemma. ""If you force banks to make a loss on the mortgages that they issue, well, then they're going to stop issuing mortgages."" Mr Palmer's response to this criticism at the National Press Club was to highlight that his policy was directed at existing mortgage borrowers. ""It's not a question of keep loaning; it's a question that they've already lent,"" he said. But there are ways to support banks keeping mortgages at very low interest rates. One way would be for the government to subsidise the difference between the cost to banks of raising funds through deposits and on global markets, and the mortgage cap. But, with more than $1.3 trillion of owner-occupier home loans outstanding, Dr Edwards said that would not come cheap. ""I think the costs would be extravagant,"" he argued. ""For every 1 per cent of the mortgage rate that you're subsidising somebody's got to pay about $13 billion. ""If you want to do it for 2 per cent that's $26 billion, and you want to do it for five years, well you're getting well above $100 billion. And, even today, $100 billion is quite a lot of money."" UAP leader Craig Kelly told News Corp in a recent interview that the cheap mortgages could be funded by the government issuing bonds at 0.1 or 0.2 per cent and on-lending that money to the banks. The problem is that the current Australian government five-year bond rate is already above the proposed 3 per cent mortgage cap, and no private investor would take such a low return. There is one institution that could provide this kind of funding — the Reserve Bank. Fixed home loans were at record lows during the height of the pandemic, and Reserve Bank actions were a big reason why. In fact, it already ran a similar scheme during the pandemic, which is one reason why there were so many fixed mortgages available at interest rates below 2 per cent until that program ended in the middle of last year. ""The [mortgage cap] scheme would only work if banks could obtain funding below (and well below) the cap,"" explained Mr Blythe. ""The RBA did achieve this outcome as part of its QE [quantitative easing] operations via the Term Funding Facility during the pandemic. ""But those were unusual times and shouldn't be the norm."" The Reserve Bank has operated independently of government since the early 1990s, but there is a provision in the Reserve Bank Act that allows the government to override its decisions and dictate policy. This provision would likely have to be used to force the RBA into another cheap mortgage funding program, given that it is currently fighting a problem with high inflation. The Reserve Bank's latest economic forecasts differ wildly from Treasury's latest budget numbers, which are barely a month old. ""The Reserve Bank of Australia has recently increased interest rates, and the reason why they did that was to try and head off the higher increase in prices that we're seeing in the Australian economy,"" explained Dr Gross, a former RBA economist. ""If the government forced them to lower interest rates back down in order to finance these cheaper mortgages, then we would see higher prices at the supermarket and everywhere else in the Australian economy."" Dr Gross said it would also likely hurt people who do not already own a house. ""Any attempt to lower interest rates below their current historic lows is going to push up house prices,"" he observed. ""Certainly that's going to make it harder for first home buyers to break into the market in the first place."" Mr Palmer responded to inflation concerns by saying that the policy would only apply to home loans and business loans secured by a home. ""There's other things we can do about inflation and, of course, it's to do with the money supply and how that's handled,"" he said. ""But we're not talking about general interest rates; we're talking about home loan interest rates."" The Reserve Bank wants you to believe it has inflation under control. Gareth Hutchens asks: ""Do you believe it?"" However, home loans account for about 60 per cent of bank lending in Australia, and Dr Edwards warned the RBA might have to be more aggressive in other areas to get price rises back under control. ""If a very large part of the economy is insulated from interest rate rises, and interest rate rises are what you're relying on to restrain demand, then interest rate rises everywhere else have to be much higher,"" he said. ""So basically, whichever way you do it, people without mortgages one way or another end up paying to subsidise the people who are getting these cheap interest rates?"" I asked him. ""Absolutely,"" he responded. And Michael Blythe said that could prove to be unpopular with a much larger group of people than mortgage borrowers. ""If we do somehow engineer a low interest rate environment then that's great for the borrowers. But the two-thirds of the population that are net savers wont be so supportive."" In the end, a discussion of whether a mortgage cap in 2022 would work is likely to prove academic. Neither major party likely to form government — the Liberal/National Coalition or Labor — have indicated any support for the idea. And the ABC's election analyst Antony Green does not believe the UAP will be in a position of power to push it. ""At most, the UAP could get one Senate seat,"" he said. ""Clive Palmer has been contesting elections for almost a decade, and his vote has continued to slip downwards from the days in 2013, when they got a substantial vote in Queensland. ""I don't think he's got much chance of getting elected. ""There would be a very small outside chance that he could get up in Queensland, where he's the lead candidate, but other than that, the UAP has no realistic chance of winning a seat anyway."" The ABC approached the United Australia Party for comment about this story on multiple occasions and received no response.

10,"A decade of savings isn’t enough for most first home buyers, as deposits soar out of reach",business,"  A decade of savings isn’t enough for most first home buyers, as deposits soar out of reach For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency It takes a first home buyer almost 11.5 years to save a 20 per cent deposit for an average priced home. And as of March 2022, the national median dwelling value was estimated to be eight-and-a-half times the median annual household income level nationally. This is a record high according to CoreLogic's latest housing affordability report and has increased from 6.8 since the onset of COVID-19 two years prior. CoreLogic bases its modelling on a national median home value of $750,000 and Australian National University (ANU) income data which assumes an average of about $86,000. Its Australian head of research Eliza Owen says while house prices are expected to fall nationally as interest rates continue to rise, that won't necessarily improve affordability. ""The expectation is that property prices will fall off the back of higher interest rates, but this shifts the dynamic from trying to come up with a deposit to an increase in the cost of servicing [a home loan],"" she says. Falling house prices is not something that first home buyer Tarryn Hendry considered when she purchased her Brisbane property earlier this year. It took her and her partner years to save and find a suitable property, and when they finally broke into the market, they had to spend $200,000 over their budget. CoreLogic says from the end of September 2020, through to the end of March 2022, Australian home values saw an ""extraordinary upswing"". During this period, house prices increased 27.8 per cent across Australian capital cities. ""We started with a cost range [budget of] $550,000 to $600,000, and then we ended up purchasing a place that was that $200,000 over that,"" Ms Hendry tells ABC News. ""We're getting priced out … there was huge competition. ""Our budget kept increasing. We couldn't find anything more affordable, that was appropriate for us to buy, in terms of location and the quality of the place."" CoreLogic says the portion of household income to service new mortgage repayments sat at 41.4 per cent nationally in March 2022, above the decade average of 36.5 per cent. ""This was the third consecutive increase at the national level, with higher average mortgage rates and property values contributing to the uplift,"" CoreLogic's report said. As interest rates rise, almost 300,000 people who took large and risky home loans during the pandemic could fall into severe financial hardship or even default. The report suggests that in a higher interest rate environment, mortgage serviceability will become more challenging, not only tipping more Australians into mortgage stress, but also making it harder for first home buyers to get a loan they can service. At the same time, rents are also rising, denting the ability of young people to save for a deposit. At the national level, the portion of household income now required to service rent on a new lease increased to 30.6 per cent, up from 29.8 per cent in December 2021, and 28.5 per cent in the March quarter of 2020. The report says rental affordability conditions vary markedly between regions. ""Relatively weak rental market conditions across Sydney and Melbourne, especially across the unit sector through the first year of the pandemic, meant the level of income required to service rent on a new lease has actually fallen in these cities since March 2020,"" it said. Most big four bank economists expect more rate hikes to come. CBA expects the cash rate to lift to 1.60 per cent by February 2023, Westpac and ANZ expect it will reach 2.25 per cent by May 2023, while NAB thinks it will hit 2.60 per cent by August 2024. Economists are also predicting home values to fall between 5 and 20 per cent over the next two years. Ms Owen says assuming a 15 per cent property price decline and a mortgage rate of almost 5 per cent (variable rate, assuming the cash rate lifts to 2.25 per cent) ""you save on the deposit, but you spend more over the life of the loan"". ""Weighing up higher interest costs with lower prices should be a key consideration for first home buyers,"" Ms Owen says. ANZ's head of home loans John Campbell said there was a cohort of customers that had borrowed six or more times their income that could tip into mortgage stress as interest rates rise. ""There will be customers that experience some level of stress as rates continue to go up,"" Mr Campbell said. He urged them to speak to the bank if they fall into trouble, ""so we can see what we can do to help"". CoreLogic's report notes that one of the most significant barriers to home ownership in Australia is the upfront costs for first home buyers, which includes the deposit hurdle. It said in March 2022 a 20 per cent deposit for the current median dwelling value across Australia was $147,795. The desire to make housing more affordable also needs to address the worrying flip side: falling house prices for many Australians. ""Assuming a household income savings rate of 15 per cent annually, this puts the current time estimated to save a 20 per cent deposit at 11.4 years nationally, a record high,"" the report said. ""The median measure of years taken to save a 20 per cent deposit has risen by 2.2 years since March 2020 nationally."" ""Looking at the back series of this metric, which extends to 2001, this is the fastest uplift in the metric over a two-year period on record. ""It highlights the speed at which home values have risen through the current upswing, in which annual growth rates have been at their highest since the 1980s."" Ms Hendry says housing affordability has been dire for some years and is getting worse as wages are not rising in line with inflation. She worries about mortgage serviceability if rates rises and house prices fall but her income doesn't change. ""Wage growth does need to follow,"" she says.

11,'They've been selling this lie': It's a dream holiday destination for some. Others tell a different story,business,"  The fight to take back Hawaii: How native Hawaiians are reclaiming their culture, language and land For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency For over a century, the destiny of this island paradise has been in the hands of outsiders. Now native Hawaiians are reclaiming their culture, language and land. It's known as the Seven Mile Miracle. The famed North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii, is home to some of the world's most iconic surf breaks. Every year, the North Shore plays centre stage for an epic battle between the world's best surfers for the sport's most coveted crown, the Pipeline Pro. But just beyond these fabled sands, another battle is being waged. It's a fight to keep Hawaii Hawaiian. Under swaying palm trees in the quiet streets behind Sunset Beach — Paumalū to the locals — Pomai Hoapili is holding on to a slice of paradise that has been in his family for generations. Pomai grew up here in a small home, set between the roaring ocean and the green Hawaiian hills, with Pipeline and Sunset on his doorstep. ""I live in the middle of these two super famous waves that people make pilgrimages out to, to come and catch a few waves,"" he says. ""They pay millions of dollars to come here where I live. I'm blessed to grow up here."" But Pomai is an increasing rarity on Hawaii's North Shore — a native Hawaiian. As property prices soar, many native Hawaiians — or Kānaka Maoli — are being squeezed out, unable to keep pace with crippling property taxes and skyrocketing rents. The pandemic has only made the problem worse, pushing prices to record highs as mainlanders from the US look to Hawaii for an island bolthole. Just down the road, the so-called ""Quiksilver house"" on the beachfront at Pipeline sold last year for $US5 million, more than double the price it last changed hands for, in 2009. For Pomai, who works as a lifeguard for the famous Hawaiian Water Patrol, staying on the North Shore is about more than holding on to the family home. It's about maintaining a connection to Hawaiian culture, which has revolved around surfing and the ocean since Hawaiians took to the waves on wooden boards hundreds of years ago. ""I want to be a Hawaiian on Hawaiian land,"" he says. ""We're lucky to be able to pull it off, you know. But it's definitely not easy. Living in Hawaii, staying in Hawaii, you gotta hustle. It's not an easy thing."" Like many Hawaiians, Pomai feels a sense of pride that these islands gave surfing to the world and continues to produce world champions like Carissa Moore. But the growth of surfing into a multi-billion-dollar global industry has also helped transform the sleepy North Shore into one of the most desirable postcodes on the planet. ""It's pretty well overrun,"" he says. ""Surfing's taken up a huge chunk of housing and resources on the North Shore, as well as waves."" Many of the original homes have been flattened to make way for modern mansions. Locals who sell up often end up buying on the US mainland, where properties are more affordable and they can live in relative comfort. Los Angeles County is now home to more native Hawaiians than the island of Maui. Pomai has seen others sell up, but once they leave, he says, ""it's hard to come back"". ""Somebody's going to take your spot, guaranteed. People are fighting outside the door,"" he says. ""But this is home, so we're going to stay, hold it down. There's no other option."" For the Kānaka Maoli, the struggle to retain control of their land is a constant. It dates back over a century to when the Kingdom of Hawaii was illegally overthrown. ""We are our own country,"" says Pomai. ""There is no annexation treaty [with the US]. We are actually our own sovereign nation illegally occupied by the United States of America."" On January 17, 1893, a group of American fruit and sugar plantation oligarchs launched a coup against Queen Liliuokalani, putting her under house arrest inside Iolani palace. At first, the United States of America didn't endorse the coup, but in 1898 it annexed the Kingdom of Hawaii and administered it as a US territory until 1959, when Hawaii became the 50th US state. ""This is a theft — premeditated, systematised theft,"" says Kalehua Krug, a Hawaiian charter school principal and community leader. ""They took it from our chiefs. They took it from the royalty. They took it from all of our families."" Kalehua is among a generation of Hawaiians committed to the rebirth of native Hawaiian culture. His school teaches the Hawaiian native language – which nearly went extinct after generations were discouraged from speaking it – as well as traditional hula dancing, alongside the mainstream school curriculum. ""When you give the culture and ceremony and language to them at a young age, they don't have to feel the loss like we did,"" Kalehua says of his students. ""You know, they don't have to take that punch in the gut that we had to take."" Land seizure has been central to the US's effort to control Hawaii, he says, ""because land, you know, builds generational wealth, and they could control the resources"". ""They could lock up the water, they could lock up the food, they could lock up the ability of Hawaii to self-sustain."" The land is no longer sustaining native Hawaiians, Kalehua says. People have been forced to turn to new ways to get by. Soon after the US made Hawaii a state, a new kind of visitor followed – tourists. A Time magazine article published in 1966 called it a ""jet rush"", as the number of visitors arriving to the islands had doubled in recent years. That jet rush never ended. On Oahu's South Shore, Waikiki is a bucket list destination for millions of tourists lured by its white sands and postcard-perfect sunsets. But for many native Hawaiians living and working in the capital, Honolulu, the tourism idyll is little more than a mirage. Peeling back Waikiki's layers is Honolulu local Chris Kahunahana, a filmmaker who has lived here for much of his life. Chris is one of an emerging group of indigenous artists challenging the postcard cliches about Hawaii on the big screen. ""Initially in the film industry, Hawaii was seen as Hollywood's backdrop,"" he says. ""It served as a beautiful location for a Caucasian hero. But the stories weren't from here, they were just using here as an exotic location, one that's prettier than Detroit, right? ""The world is starting to understand the value of authentic stories. They're tired of the same old shit."" Chris sees it as an artist's job to ""hold up a mirror to society and say, 'Hey, look at this ugly picture'"". His acclaimed feature film, Waikiki – the first directed by a native Hawaiian – does just that. Through its main character Kea – a woman living out of her car while balancing multiple jobs in the tourism industry – the film explores how hard it is for indigenous Hawaiians to get by in contemporary Hawaii. Many of the issues the film raises stem from the separation of Hawaiians from their land, Chris says, which has cut off many from economic opportunities. ""Hawaii is being sold to the global elite,"" he says. ""Anyone around the world who has any kind of resources wants a piece of paradise. ""And it's because of this tourism industry – they've been selling this lie of Hawaii as a paradise."" The demand for a piece of Hawaii is pushing some out. ""Without Hawaiians, is it really Hawaii? It's not,"" says Chris. ""The powers that be, they don’t give a shit."" In 2019, more than 10 million visitors flocked to Hawaii, with most rubbing their toes on the sands of Waikiki. Tourism is Hawaii's biggest economic driver and accounts for 21 per cent of jobs in the state, but hospitality staff are among the islands' worst paid workers. Like the protagonist in Chris's film, some live a precarious existence on on the edge of poverty, unable to secure stable housing. Hawaii, he says, regularly tops the list of the US's most expensive places to live, ahead of New York and California. ""At least in San Francisco, you have the tech industry; in New York, you have media – it's f***ing New York!"" he says. ""Unfortunately, the only jobs that they provide for people in Hawaii are tourism jobs. ""They are like servant jobs – you are providing them a service, entertainment, an experience – a cultural experience, right? ""They are not really interested in the real culture. They are interested in experiencing it as entertainment. It's not back and forth, it's not give and take – it's just take, take, take, take."" The result has been an epidemic of homelessness, a problem that disproportionately affects native Hawaiians. Hawaii now has the third-highest homeless rate in the USA. Half of the state's homeless are native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, despite only making up 20 per cent of the population. According to Chris, they're not really homeless, but ""houseless"". ""The fact they can't afford to purchase a house – [Hawaii] is still their home,"" he says. ""This is their home. They just don't have a house."" On Oahu's west side, Makaha Beach is famed as the birthplace of big wave surfing, where waterfront apartments take in views of waves peeling around the point. But Oahu's fiercely beautiful west side is also where Hawaii's homelessness crisis is most apparent. All along the ribbon of the Farrington Highway, which skirts the coast on Oahu's western shore, native Hawaiian flags flap upside down in the breeze, on porches and in shop windows. It's a sign of distress. Also dotting the foreshore are makeshift homeless camps, where individuals and families live in makeshift shelters, trapped between two worlds. Many have jobs, their children go to local schools, and life continues – they are indeed ""houseless"". With limited support from the state, one community is tackling the issue themselves and establishing a more permanent solution. Houseless Hawaiians are living on the beaches of Oahu's west side. Foreign Correspondent: Matt Davis Not far from the rolling waves of Makaha, behind rows of gleaming yachts in the Wai'anae Boat Harbour, is Pu'uhonua O Wai'anae, a permanent homeless camp. Pu'uhonua means ""place of refuge"". That's what the camp's founder and matriarch, Twinkle Borge, intends for people to find here when they fall on hard times. Pu'uhonua O Wai'anae has existed beside the boat harbour for almost 20 years since Twinkle, herself homeless, set up camp on the beach. ""At the time there were about seven of us sleeping on the beachfront,"" she says. ""As people started coming, I would just give away my camp – because I didn't want to see kids stressing, I didn't want to see them sleeping on the ground."" Since establishing the camp in 2004, Twinkle has transformed it into a more permanent home for around 250 people. All members of the village are required to do community service – both inside the camp and in the surrounding public space – to keep the areas clean and safe. John Isaac, 22, moved here four years ago, joining his parents who were already living in the camp. ""I was living on my own already,"" he says. ""But the house I was living in was getting evicted."" John's mother is full of praise for Twinkle, calling her ""the head of the spear"". ""I'm not saying we are 100 per cent the solution,"" Twinkle says. ""But we are part of the solution."" In her air-conditioned bedroom in the camp, Twinkle explains the daily challenges the community faces living here. There is no running water, so water must be collected from public showers in the boat harbour. The camp is bathed in the constant whirr of generators to keep a limited supply of power on. ""We don't have that privilege of going in and turning on our lights, flicking that pipe to turn on our water,"" she says. ""Yeah, here we bring in our own waters. We have generators."" But Twinkle and her inner circle have hatched a plan to change this – a plan for a slice of land to live on. In the long, green valley that stretches inland from the boat harbour, Twinkle is beaming with pride. ""For the last five years I kept telling people, 'This is going to be our home',"" she says. ""Five years I passed this gate and said, 'that is our home'. ""Well, this is our home. We are here."" Through a mix of donations and grants, Twinkle has bought a 8-hectare plot, which she has named Pu'uhonua Mauka. It will be a permanent home for many displaced in their own land. ""It is amazing. I never thought I would be doing the things that I am doing today. I am able to help my family, you know, to be a little bit more productive,"" she says. ""The plan is building out our homes, bringing up people home, try to work towards being self-sustaining. And guess what, they all going to get running water!"" For Twinkle, her reward is seeing the next generation break the cycle of dispossession. “My pay day is when my kids bring me home their diplomas,” she says. “It might be a big sacrifice for me, but at the end it will be a reward – to see the accomplishment, to see the cycle that they are breaking, for their family. Yeah, yeah, that’s pay day.” For Pomai Hoapili, life is best lived in a state where ""everything seems like surfing, or like flowing. That is the ultimate goal,"" he says,. At his home on the North Shore, he's also focused on nurturing the next generation. His 10-year-old daughter Wela is enrolled in a school that teaches the Hawaiian language. Pomai is also taking classes so they can speak to each other in Hawaiian as much as possible. It's already bridging the generational divide. When Wela first spoke Hawaiian to her great grandmother, the old woman wept with joy. ""My grandma starts crying, sits down and cries a little bit,"" Pomai says. ""They took it away in three generations. We're going to get it back in one. Whatever it takes."" He believes Hawaiians are in the midst a cultural renaissance, if only those still calling the islands home can withstand the pressures forcing them out. “Be Hawaiian, speak Hawaiian, live Hawaiian,” he says. “The longer you stay alive, the longer people remember we're here. But if we stop down the line, people stop talking about us, we disappear. So, we got to keep practising."" Watch 'Keep Hawaii Hawaiian' on iview and YouTube.

12,The tax cut that will send middle earners backwards and give high earners thousands,business,"  The stage 3 tax cut that will send middle earners backwards and give high earners thousands For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Reserve Bank is pushing up interest rates to take money out of our hands. The first increase in the current round will add about $65 a month to the cost of paying off a $500,000 mortgage. The second will add a bit more. If, as the bank's forecasts assume, there are another four such increases this year, that's a further $275 a month, and so on. The point, in the words of the Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe, is to ""slow the economy, to get things back onto an even keel"". In a helpful video, the Governor explains that rate rises take money out of mortgagors' hands directly, make it harder to borrow, make people ""feel less happy"", and hit the price of houses and other assets so people ""don't feel as confident and they don't spend as much"". Which is fair enough, if the Governor decides that's what's needed. So why on earth are we scheduled to do the opposite? From mid-2024 the government will put an awful lot of money in people's hands. Stage 3 of the income tax cuts will cost $15.7 billion in its first year. Data on inflation, wages and jobs are due to be released before the federal election on May 21 and these represent four wildcards for the campaign. By way of comparison, that's almost as much as the $16.3 billion that will be spent on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that year, and more than the $10.5 billion that will be spent on higher education. That it is mistimed ought not be a surprise. Stage 3 was legislated in 2018. The treasurer at the time, back in the year Grant Denyer won the Gold Logie, was Scott Morrison, who said he was legislating stages 1, 2 and 3 of the tax cuts all at once (and stage 3 six years ahead) in order to provide ""certainty"". So uncertain was the treasury about the future back then that it only forecast the economy two years ahead, and produced less reliable and more mechanical ""projections"" for the following two years, neither of which extended to 2024. At the time the Reserve Bank had been cutting interest rates (12 times in a row), at the time inflation was 1.9 per cent. It looked as if the economy could do with a bit of a boost, albeit a boost which wouldn't be delivered for six years. In saying that things have changed, it's fair to also acknowledge that things might change back again. We can't be sure what will be needed in 2024, although we can be a good deal more sure than we had back then. The stage 3 tax cuts were opposed by Labor at first, but are now backed by Labor treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers after ""weighing up a whole range of considerations"". They are overwhelmingly directed at high earners. Of the $184.2 billion the parliamentary budget office believes stage 3 will cost in its first seven years, $137.9 billion is directed to Australians on $120,000 or more. The sales pitch for the Government's tax cuts sounds compelling — more money in your pocket, leaving no-one worse off. But, in economics, there's rarely a free lunch. Part of stage 3, the part that cuts the rate applying to incomes over $45,000 from 32.5 cents in the dollar to 30 cents, will benefit most taxpayers. The bigger part extends that low rate all the way up to $200,000, abolishing an entire rung of the tax ladder paid by the highest earners. For those very high earners, the part of their income that was taxed at 37 cents will be taxed at 30, as will part of the rest that was taxed at 45 cents. A politician, on a base salary of $211,250, will get a tax cut of $9,075. A registered nurse on $72,235 will get a tax cut of $681 according to calculations prepared by the Australia Institute. More broadly, a typical middle earner can expect $250 a year, whereas a typical earner in the top fifth can expect $4,230 according to a separate analysis by the parliamentary budget office. The fate of the middle earner will be made worse by the loss of the $1,000+ middle income tax offset which wasn't extended in this year's budget, sending the middle earner backwards. The typical female earner will go backwards too after the loss of the offset, getting half as much as the typical (higher earning) male, according to the budget office. The logic is (or was) that middle and higher earners would need big tax cuts to compensate them for bracket creep (which is wage rises pushing them into higher tax brackets), though there's been a lot less of that than expected. Were it not for the fact that Labor supports and will implement it, stage 3 would provide a stark contrast with Labor leader Anthony Albanese's approach unveiled on Tuesday of asking the Fair Work Commission to lift the minimum wage to compensate for inflation. Such an increase would go to low wage earners first, and flow through more slowly to award wages. It would give the greatest help to those who needed it the most when they needed it, rather than years in the future when things might be quite different.

13,Elon Musk's Twitter deal 'temporarily on hold',business,"  Elon Musk places $61.4 billion deal for Twitter on hold over details on fake accounts For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Elon Musk said Friday that his planned $US44 billion ($61.4 billion) purchase of Twitter is ""temporarily on hold"" pending details about spam and fake accounts on the social media platform. In a tweet, the Tesla billionaire linked to a Reuters story from May 2 citing a financial filing from Twitter that estimated false or spam accounts made up fewer than five per cent of the company's daily active users — totalling 229 million users — in the first quarter. ""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,"" Mr Musk wrote. The move indicates Mr Musk is skeptical that the number of unauthentic accounts is that low and is the latest twist amid signs of internal turmoil over the acquisition. It wasn't clear whether the issue could scuttle the deal. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr Musk's representatives or his company, Tesla Inc, were not immediately available for a comment. Stock in both Twitter and Tesla swung sharply in opposite directions, with Twitter's stock tumbling 18 per cent, and Tesla, which Mr Musk had proposed using to help fund the Twitter deal, jumped 5 per cent. Investors have had to weigh legal troubles for Mr Musk, as well as the possibility that acquiring Twitter could be a distraction from running the world's most valuable automaker. Elon Musk's brilliant track record has seen even the most blue-blooded establishment figures overlook his more outlandish and erratic behaviour. But this time, even his most ardent supporters have their doubts, writes Ian Verrender. Mr Musk, the world's richest man and a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, had said that one of his priorities would be to remove ""spam bots"" from the platform. Mr Musk has previously been critical of Twitter's moderation policy. He has said he wants Twitter's algorithm to prioritise tweets to be public and was against too much power on the service to corporations that advertise. Twitter said it faced several risks until the deal with Mr Musk is closed, including whether advertisers would continue to spend on Twitter amid ""potential uncertainty regarding future plans and strategy."" Earlier this week, he said he would reverse Twitter's ban on former US President Donald Trump when he buys the social media platform, signalling his intention to cut moderation of the site.

15,New push for Kalgoorlie and Esperance air link in a potential 'game changer' for WA's south coast,business,"  Proposed air link between Kalgoorlie and Esperance a potential 'game changer' For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tourism officials hope a new partnership will make flights between Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Esperance a reality on Western Australia's south coast later this year. It comes as the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder steps up efforts to reinstate an eastern states air link, which was suspended at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Kalgoorlie-Boulder-Esperance Aviation Development Partnership is made up of the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, the Shire of Esperance and tourism body Australia's Golden Outback (AGO). AGO Esperance tourism development manager Simon Latchford said negotiations were underway with prospective carriers and was hopeful flights could begin as early as September. He quipped the ""walls are coming down"" after two years of the pandemic and WA's hard border ending in March. ""For us to be able to work together to get large aircraft running services out of Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide into Kalgoorlie, we can then leverage off that by providing an appropriate connecting service between Kalgoorlie and Esperance,"" Mr Latchford said. ""That's a game changer … from a business perspective you can fly up in the morning and fly back in the evening in Esperance. ""So it's great for business and it's great for tourism, obviously, because people can now access the region."" Regional Express (REX) is the only commercial passenger service flying into Esperance on a government-regulated route from Perth. The airline began operating the route in February 2016 and has a contract with the state government until June 30, 2023. Meanwhile, the Kalgoorlie-Boulder Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been canvassing the local business community about preferred days for flights to Melbourne. A short online survey asked questions such as how many times a year businesses would use the service and for what purpose. Kalgoorlie-Boulder Airport manager Chris Barnes said he could not discuss which airlines were in negotiations about an eastern states air link. He said there had been ""excellent feedback"" from the business community. ""We already have an understanding, from our historic numbers, of what the average traveller would be using those services for and what the peaks are,"" he said. ""It's important we understand what the business travellers are seeking and what businesses are requiring on those routes, so when we look at negotiating these routes, we can understand best what works best for everyone."" Virgin Australia's direct flights to Melbourne were suspended when the pandemic prompted the introduction of tough border restrictions and eventually forced the airline into administration. Qantas previously ran direct flights between Kalgoorlie-Boulder and Adelaide but the route was axed in 2014 due to poor ticket sales. Meanwhile, the state government today announced $4 million to underpin new direct flights between Karratha and Geraldton. Operated by Aviair, the new route expands the existing Inter-Regional Flight Network, which currently provides flights between Karratha and Port Hedland, Newman and Broome, and Newman and Port Hedland. WA Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said it would significantly reduce travel times, with many small business and FIFO travellers in Geraldton currently travelling to the Pilbara via Perth.

16,Waterfront house in Howrah breaks Tasmanian real estate records,business,"  Waterfront house in Howrah sells for $8.533 million, breaking Tasmanian real estate records For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A waterfront estate on Hobart's eastern shore has sold for $8.533 million, breaking the real estate record for a suburban house in Tasmania. The five-bedroom, three-bathroom home is located on more than 10,000 square metres of land on Howrah Point, adjacent to Little Howrah Beach, with views of the River Derwent and kunanyi/Mount Wellington as a backdrop. The property, named ""Domi Riviere"", had been used as a family home for nearly 30 years before it went on the market about a month ago, receiving interest from buyers locally, interstate, and overseas. ""To have a significant land holding and level of privacy on the waterfront within such close proximity to the city is extremely rare,"" Knight Frank Tasmania residential sales agent Brad Stephens said. ""Properties like this don't go on the market very often because they are passed through generations or are retained within families."" While Mr Stephens could not comment on who bought the property or what future plans they had for the estate, he did say there was broad interest. ""Some people wanted to keep it as a family home, other individuals wanted to chop it down and sell different parts of the property and look for a return from a development perspective. ""It was an even split between developers and people who wanted to occupy the home."" According to property website Domain, the median price for a four-bedroom house in Howrah is currently more than $800,000, compared to $644,000 last year and $623,000 in 2020. The northern Hobart suburb of Glenorchy has also seen a significant increase in the median house price, currently sitting at $705,000 for a four-bedroom home compared to $520,000 in 2021. CoreLogic head of research Eliza Owen said Hobart had seen ""the greatest capital growth of any of the capital city housing markets in the past five years"", at 70 per cent. ""It's gone from being one of the most affordable capital cities to one of the least, and that's across both house prices and rental values,"" she said. The demand for property in Hobart has also spilt over to the regions, with growing interest in places such as Launceston. ""Launceston has seen additional interest from investors and even locals who are priced out of Hobart,"" Ms Owen said. ""That kind of housing growth has spread through to the whole of the state."" But CoreLogic expects the demand for housing will ""cool off"" after an extremely long stretch of growth. ""Our [CoreLogic] Home Value Index showed a decline in values of 0.3 per cent across Hobart for the month of April and we expect that trend to continue,"" Ms Owen said. ""When you get an increase in interest rates and mortgage rates you are increasing the cost of debt, and when you increase the cost of something, people can afford less of it.""

17,Charity disability organisation owed 'more than $1.5m' from the NDIS as resident families pursue legal action in NSW,business,"  NDIA appeals to Federal Court after being told to pay $1.5m to Nardy House for residents' care For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Caring for some of the most vulnerable people in our society can be a challenging job, but for one charity organisation it has been made much harder due to a pay dispute with the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA). Nardy House employs 22 staff to care for a small number of high-needs residents living with severe disabilities at Quaama on New South Wales' far south coast. The charity organisation relies on funding from the NDIA's National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) to provide 24-hour care to its residents. But Nardy House chief executive officer Denise Redmond said the NDIA was holding back funds for three of its residents. She said without adequate NDIS funding, the facility could be forced to close, which is why the families of residents had taken the government agency to court. ""If Nardy House closes there is nowhere else for these people to go,"" Ms Redmond said. ""That causes enormous angst for the parents and that's why they've undertaken this [legal battle]. ""If they don't, their child will end up in a nursing home."" In October 2019, the NDIA notified three residents at Nardy House that their funding for registered nurse care would be cut. The families of those residents took the NDIA to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) to ensure the cost of care by registered nurses was met by the agency. A parent of one of the residents, who could not be named due to legal reasons, said the changes were made without reason. ""At first I thought it was just pure penny pinching,"" the parent said. ""I know the NDIS costs a lot of money."" The AAT overturned the decision in December last year and ordered the NDIA to pay Nardy House for the care provided, backdated to October 2019, at a cost of more than $1.5 million. But Ms Redmond said the money had not been paid. ""Nardy House is paying the bills,"" she said. ""NDIS holding funds back from participants with the highest level of need is amoral. ""There's something really wrong here."" The NDIA has appealed the decision by the AAT and the matter is before the Federal Court. In a statement, the NDIA said it made funding decisions in accordance with the NDIS Act based on what was considered ""reasonable and necessary"". ""The NDIA does not, and was never intended to, replace other mainstream government services, such as the health system,"" a spokesperson said. The agency did not respond to specific ABC questions about why they decided to cut the funding to the three residents at Nardy House and about who made that decision. In response to the AAT ruling, it said it was ""currently funding registered nurses at Nardy House"" but did not confirm whether it had paid the money Nardy House said it was owed. It also said that while it had implemented the measures in the AAT's ruling, no further action would be taken until a Federal Court ruling was made. ""The agency is appealing this decision with the Federal Court and will await the Federal Court's ruling before any further resolution,"" the spokesperson said.

18,'We need this Tanami Road so desperately': WA budget allocates funding to transform desert track,business,"  Tanami Road to be sealed, leaders predict economic transformation to desert region For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A large part of the Australian desert could be economically transformed in decades to come with WA's budget confirming work will finally get underway on sealing the Tanami Road. Halls Creek Shire has long lobbied the Commonwealth and state governments to turn the major outback route that connects the town and the NT border into a highway. In yesterday's state budget, just over half the $500-million price tag was allocated in the forward estimates, a contribution shared between WA and the Commonwealth. The budget notes said the remainder would be allocated beyond the forward estimates, while the project was expected to take the best part of a decade to complete due to the challenges posed by the harsh environment and remote location. Halls Creek Shire president Malcolm Edwards said it was at the top of the region's infrastructure priority list. ""It's just fantastic. It's been my number one project for many, many years,"" he said. ""It's taken a long time … I've done two trips to Canberra advocating for it."" Work is expected to start after environmental and heritage approvals are sought. The Tanami is currently home to about 2,000 Aboriginal people in a region of entrenched poverty and overcrowding. Cr Edwards said turning the 314 km dirt road into a highway would allow mining and agriculture to turn a profit in the remote area. ""The further you drive the Tanami the less viable the pastoral stations become. There's Unallocated Crown Land that could carry 50,000 more head [of cattle]. So that means more jobs,"" he said. ""Ninety per cent of the mines in Australia are 10 km from a highway. ""So once the Tanami goes through, I've spoken to the miners down there and they reckon it will be a lot easier to get investors with a bitumen road. ""There are that many leases down there. It'll open it right up for exploration."" If Cr Edwards' vision becomes realised, then Halls Creek will likely face significant growing pains. The increase in truck traffic would push the case for a bypass to be built around the town, while new housing developments would be needed to house workers and alleviate widespread overcrowding. Every wet season the Tanami Road suffers significant damage and communities can be cut off for months at a time. Curtin University supply chain expert Elizabeth Jackson said sealing the road also had benefits to the wider region, by providing another avenue for delivering goods to the Kimberley. ""The opportunity to develop and broaden our transport links in and out of this state to ensure a free, steady flow of products is absolutely wonderful news,"" she said. ""We've experienced the dreadful outcomes of COVID and natural disasters to our overland links. These are examples of why we need this Tanami Road so desperately."" Environs Kimberley executive director Martin Pritchard was concerned about how such a large economic transformation would impact an area relatively untouched by development. ""That area could be in for a hammering and what we should be doing is looking after these large areas of intact vegetation,"" he said.

19,The dollar is down below 69 US cents. That means one thing to the market — and it's not good news,business,"  As the Aussie dollar falls against the US dollar, more economic pressure looms for households For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Australian dollar has become a little unpopular of late. In April it was trading above 75 US cents, but this week it's fallen below 70 US cents. For currency market watchers, that's a sizeable move in just a couple of months. On Thursday, it slipped towards 68 US cents (68.82 US cents at 3.30pm AEST). It's now close to where it settled during the pandemic-induced financial crisis. As professional investor Danielle Ecuyer tweeted, ""AUD under US0.69 — risk off, risk off, risk off"". That's market jargon for ""sell, sell, sell"". The sharp fall in the Australian dollar coincided with another broad and sharp sell-off on the Australian Stock Exchange. But it's the dollar that's likely to put pressure on every Australian hip pocket nerve. The lower the dollar falls, the more upwards pressure it will put on inflation and, of course, the cost of living. That's because the dollar in your pocket doesn't go as far when you're buying something made overseas. So just how much extra pressure is it likely to add to already squeezed household budgets? The fear at this juncture is that the Australian dollar has further to fall. There are several forces putting downward pressure on the value of the Australian dollar versus the US dollar. They include concerns about how the ongoing pandemic will influence China's economic growth and therefore its demand for Australia's commodities, like iron ore. The stronger China's demand for iron ore, coal and gas, the more interest there is in Australian dollars. Also, the US Federal Reserve is in the process of raising interest rates, and potentially quite aggressively. The higher US interest rates go, relative to Australian interest rates, the more demand there is for US dollars, and the less demand for Australian dollars and the value of our currency falls. The Aussie dollar is also negatively affected by poor market sentiment, or pessimism about the global economy. And this is being made worse by the prospect of rising global interest rates. Westpac's currency strategist Sean Callow says, in the short term, the local currency is likely to drop to 68 US cents – roughly where it was in June 2020. There is no telling whether it will go up or down from there. Just about every Australian feels the impact of a rising and falling dollar. Business owners feel the pain when the cost of purchasing equipment sourced from overseas rises. On the flip side, their exports become cheaper and more competitive. Households feel the effects when they go shopping and realise the goods they purchase have risen in cost. Travellers also feel the hip pocket nerve when they go to exchange their dollars for greenbacks, and realise they've received less than they expected. Economists, though, consider anything below 75 US cents to be favourable for exporters. Yet the lower the dollar falls the less purchasing power shoppers have — that's where it hurts many of us day-to-day. The lower dollar comes at a time when consumers are feeling, well, quite miserable actually. The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index fell by 0.2 per cent last week to a 20-month low of 90.5 points. Consumer views on whether it is a good 'time to buy a major household item' dropped 2.2 per cent in the past week to a 2-year low of -15.9 points. And the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment fell by 5.6 per cent to 90.4 in May. The Index is now at its lowest level since August 2020. Business conditions and profitability are doing nicely thank you very much, but confidence among bosses isn't all that crash hot at the moment. Business confidence, as measured by the National Australia Bank (NAB), eased in April. So, realistically, at what level against the US dollar is the Australian dollar likely to hurt your family budget? ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch says it's difficult to quantify the level but that the dollar would need to fall further and stay there for a considerable period of time, for it to put upward pressure on inflation and the cost of living. The share market is screaming a message right now: The economy is not OK. And the ramifications will hit all of us. The NAB's chief economist is optimistic the Australian dollar won't do any damage to household budgets. ""[The dollar would need to fall a] long way and lags typically 12 months-to-two years,"" Alan Oster says. Forecasting precisely where the dollar will go is fraught with risk, and difficult to predict. However real wages are not expected to increase for another couple of years, and that's before considering the affects of a falling dollar on consumers' purchasing power. If the currency tide turns against the dollar and it falls significantly further, it will weigh heavily on every household budget in the country. An aggressive Reserve Bank monetary policy tightening program (raising interest rates) would help stem the tide, but that would also create further headaches for households. You could be forgiven for thinking you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't in this economic climate.

20,Higher rates and lower growth: Tough times ahead for whoever wins election ,business," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency It was a sober reminder of just who calls the shots. Shortly after the first interest rate hike in more than a decade, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg — alongside Prime Minister Scott Morrison — stood before a packed room of reporters, desperately attempting to hose down suggestions the rare, pre-election rate hike had been spurred by overly generous spending promises. Looking pensive as he batted away a question, Frydenberg's image suddenly disappeared mid-sentence. ""And now we're taking you live to a press conference with Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe,"" the presenter announced. A contrite Dr Lowe opened with an apology, quickly followed by a stark warning. Having lured hundreds of thousands of new homebuyers into the market with assurances right up until last Christmas that interest rates would be on hold until 2024, the RBA's messaging now is to prepare for a series of rate hikes this year. It was a graphic illustration of the fluidity of the global economic situation and the speed with which things are changing. And it highlighted just how easy it is to make mistakes with potentially dire consequences. Treasury's forecasts for Australia's economy — delivered just six weeks ago in a pre-election budget — are now obsolete. And while the focus from last Tuesday's RBA decision understandably has been on housing and the impact on mortgage repayments, the ramifications are far broader. For the past 30 years, interest rates globally have been in decline. That's inflated a series of asset price bubbles — everything from housing to financial markets in stocks and debt. The reasonably well-off have become fabulously wealthy and the gap between rich and poor has turned into a canyon. ANALYSIS: Catch-up on the latest from the campaign trail on Friday with Annabel Crabb The sudden shift to higher interest rates could change all that. Bond markets — where debt is traded — have been in meltdown for more than a year, clocking up massive losses. Now, global stock markets are coming under pressure. And property is likely to follow. In a few weeks — when the financial year draws to a close — the situation will be reflected in superannuation balances that will show returns far less effervescent than those to which Australians have become accustomed. The RBA may have been late to the party, but at least it wasn't in the kitchen alone last week. America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, rammed through a double rate hike the following night. Then the Bank of England followed with its fourth consecutive rate rise. Some leading analysts are warning about stagflation, but what is it anyway? More concerning, the Bank of England warned the economy could contract later this year. And while it went largely unnoticed, the US last week reported that its economy went backwards in the March quarter. That's a dangerous combination: Surging inflation accompanied by dramatic hikes in interest rates and a shrinking economy is a condition known as Stagflation — a combination of stagnation and inflation — and it is almost impossible to address. Fix one and you make the other worse. It's a devilish choice but policymakers in the past have tended to attack inflation first and pick up the pieces from a downturn later. That's why there are so many warnings right now of a recession as early as next year. Wall Street has become increasingly erratic. Last Wednesday night our time, it notched up its best performance in two years. The following night it tanked with its worst fall since October 2020. The oscillating emotions were largely driven by the same thing: interest rates. Data on inflation, wages and jobs are due to be released before the federal election on May 21 and these represent four wildcards for the campaign. On Wednesday, it was all jubilation that the US Fed boss Jerome Powell talked down prospects that rates could rise 0.75 per cent next month. The following night, it was consternation that the cost of taming inflation will be a recession. With declines of around 15 per cent since its peak late last year, Wall Street is well into correction territory now. But the pain has been felt most acutely in the high-risk technology sector which has shed almost a quarter of its value since its November peak. Our market, in contrast, so far has dropped only 5 per cent, primarily because it is so heavily geared to resources that have boomed since the pandemic and Russia's Ukraine invasion. But last week, we shed 3.1 per cent, the biggest fall this year. Stock markets are a little like show ponies. Everyone looks at the wild gyrations and ignores the real action taking place on debt markets. For 18 months, Australian debt markets have ignored the RBA's assurances that rates would not rise. As you can see in the graph below, bond rates have been soaring, turning a multi-decade trend on its head. Bond yields move inversely to bond prices. As yields go higher, prices head lower. So, what you are looking at here is a crash of almighty proportions. It has been the same story across most of the developed world. Stock markets are only just beginning to wake up. You could call it our very own economic laboratory. Across the ditch, our Kiwi cousins are giving us a little peek into the future. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has pushed through four rate hikes in quick succession, with a double hike last month taking its official rate to 1.5 per cent  — way above our 0.35 per cent. Not surprisingly, property prices have started to tumble as loan applications have tanked. It had to happen. We may have been agape at our extraordinary real estate boom. But the Kiwis — who desperately try to beat us at pretty much everything — took the pandemic property price prize. Median prices rose 24 per cent last year on the back of a 19-per-cent rise in 2020 and 12 per cent the previous year. To curb the boom, authorities late last year put loan restrictions into place. When combined with the rate hikes, that has had a devastating impact on home prices. Auckland housing shed more than 3 per cent in April and worse is to come as RBNZ figures last week showed a 46 per cent collapse in new mortgages. We're a long way from that kind of territory, given the RBA has only just dipped its toe in the rate hike pool, but like Australia, New Zealand's economy is heavily dependent upon property and hugely sensitive to rate hikes. New Zealanders have an extremely elevated household debt to income ratio of around 166 per cent. So, when interest rates go up, it becomes ever more difficult to make the repayments. But they are nowhere near in our league. Our ratio is around 186 per cent. That means it doesn't take much of a rate hike to really impact household spending which just happens to be the biggest contributor to economic growth. If households stop spending, the economy starts to slide. That's just one ball the RBA will have to juggle. The war in Europe, China shutting down to tame COVID, possible further variants, rising interest rates across the world and a slowing global economy. Taming inflation without tipping the economy into a severe recession will be no easy task. If you need any reassurance on where we are headed, check out this graph from the RBA last Friday from its quarterly Statement of Monetary Policy. It's tipping our growth will slow to 2 per cent within two years. That's not all that flash. But check out the margin for error. There's a chance we either could be booming at 4 per cent or in a protracted recession. Take your pick.
