0,"Resurgent, emergent Broncos rescue first night of Magic Round after abysmal opener",sport," Sport Brisbane Broncos continue return to form against Manly, after Magic Round gets off to rough start For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Organisers decided months ago what the first game of Magic Round would be. In some ways it's a prime slot — kicking off the most anticipated round since the opener — but it's also a graveyard slot — off free-to-air telly and starting as people get home from work or cook dinner. It was also only ever going to be a curtain-raiser to the main event, Brisbane vs Manly. With Newcastle dropping just below Canterbury to 16th on the ladder last week, it ensured the graveyard slot would be occupied by two teams effectively dead on arrival. The NRL got lucky. The people who turned up at 6pm on a Friday, less so. While the Bulldogs seem spurred on by years of futile toil at the bottom of the ladder, energised by new faces and excited by the very prospect of building towards something, Newcastle appear shellshocked to find themselves where they are. Their attack lacks spark, even with Kalyn Ponga at the back, although he looks more static than electric right now. They managed to trip over the finish line first — 16-6 — but even Knights coach Adam O'Brien couldn't watch at one point, storming out of the box when Leo Thompson dropped the ball from here. Mercifully for Thompson and fittingly for the match, the Bulldogs went up the other end and Chris Patolo also dropped the ball cold. Both mentors could have been forgiven for feigning health and safety protocols to get out of dodge, because there were any number of similar passages of play where the teams looked rudderless. At the end of an energetic, if flawed, opening stanza, on the last play of the first half, Edrick Lee moved almost 20 metres in-field to slide out wide on a left-side shift. He got a wide ball from Kalyn Ponga and was met, by not just opposite number Jayden Okunbor, but Brent Naden. Then Kyle Flanagan. Then Tevita Pangai Jr. The Bulldogs' sliding defence matched the lateral attack so easily that it must have stunned the Bulldogs that the Knights were making it that easy. The set before that, the ball went to ground between Lee and Bradman Best on a similarly ineffective slide. The play after that, Tex Hoy kicked dead on the full and crocked his shoulder. Starting from 20 metres out with seven tackles under their belt, the Bulldogs replied by failing to run at the one-armed man defending at a narrow right centre, then knocked it on before reaching the third tackle. In the second half, Newcastle strung together enough competent seconds for Ponga to put Bradman Best past some ordinary Bulldogs defence. But, true to form, the Knights knocked on off the ensuing set. Continuing the theme, the Bulldogs failed to pack the scrum in time but were still allowed to play on, only to watch fullback Matt Dufty drop the ball on the scrumbase play. It was a miracle Peter V'landys didn't get on the blower before full-time and change the rules to make this win only worth one point, but by the time it was over and the Lang Park light show started, it was clear that wasn't Magic Round's opening act; just the support act. Before the 16-team, eight-game festival of footy was official, Manly had a habit of taking the occasional home game up to Brisbane. That was evident in the support they got from the Lang Park crowd on Friday night, paired with a few refrains of Eagle Rock and coupled with some Brookvale-level booing of Adam Reynolds every time he lined up a shot at goal. The bad news for those booing was that Reynolds was lining them up a lot. Seven times to be exact. And all of them went through — the only blemish being a wayward field-goal attempt late in the first half. For the second week in a row, Reynolds played conductor, with Selwyn Cobbo and Corey Oates first and second chair violins, and Payne Haas and Pat Carrigan setting the tempo in the percussion section as the Broncos trampled their opponents. Last week it was reigning grand finalists South Sydney, this week it was a Manly side with superstar Tom Trbojevic featuring in his second game back from injury. But the gun fullback featured in the opening blunder of the game, allowing the kick-off to bounce between himself and Kieran Foran, rolling dead and handing possession back to the Broncos. Reynolds and Cobbo combined for the first time, soon after, and Brisbane — 14th last year and stone-dead last in 2020 — were off and running. Freak starts like that have happened to Brisbane over the past two years, but they've almost always let them slip with silly mistakes, lazy defence and bad execution. This time they never looked like slowing down. Trbojevic was clearly labouring at the back and couldn't impact the game, but you got the sense even at the peak of his powers, the end result would have been the same (though maybe not as emphatic as the 38-0 scoreline that eventuated). The aforementioned stars were of course excellent, as were Kurt Capewell, Kotoni Staggs and Herbie Farnworth. Crucially, Billy Walters is hitting his stride, in this case meaning passes from dummy half are finally hitting Reynolds in stride, starting Brisbane's attack off on the right note more often than not. Even the rain that has battered Brisbane for two weeks straight held off for most of the night, only really returning for the final 25 minutes to ensure Oates could have a fun slip and slide as he dove in for his double. On a night when four NRL teams took to the park, the Broncos looked by far the most competent, complete and copacetic of the lot. After watching them the past two years, if that's not enough to make you believe in magic, what is?

1,Hot Dogs start enough to see off Pies and stay in touch with top eight,sport," Sport Western Bulldogs beat Collingwood by 48 points to keep in touch with top eight For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Western Bulldogs' AFL season is back on track after an early blast set up a vital and convincing 48-point victory over Collingwood at Docklands Stadium. Entering Friday night's match under the pump at 3-5, last year's grand finalists came out firing by playing their best football all year to boot the first six goals of the match. Collingwood steadied after the first quarter onslaught to remain in the contest until midway through the third term before the Bulldogs again pulled away to lead by 46 points at the final break and prevail 14.15 (99) to 7.9 (51). Former Collingwood midfielder Adam Treloar starred for the Dogs, picking up 36 touches and slotting three goals in one of the best outings of his stellar 199-game career to be awarded the the Bob Rose-Charlie Sutton medal as best on ground. Treloar now has a 2-0 record for the Bulldogs playing Collingwood after he was controversially traded out of the Magpies at the end of 2020. The 29-year-old spearheaded a midfield that dominated the Pies as Bailey Smith (41 disposals), Jack Macrae (37) and Tom Liberatore (30) helped the Bulldogs win the clearances 43-27. Treloar, key forward Aaron Naughton, Josh Dunkley and exciting newcomer Buku Khamis all kicked three goals each for the Bulldogs. Young Collingwood forward Oliver Henry showed flashes of promise but was left to rue several missed shots at goal and a critical first quarter turnover. Henry's pass from barely 40m out was cut off, before Treloar kicked a goal at the other end and the Bulldogs quickly slammed through another four majors. In a concern for the Bulldogs, Naughton appeared troubled by a knee injury for most of the game and hobbled to the bench late in the final quarter. The night started in tough fashion for Collingwood after captain Scott Pendlebury was a late withdrawal through illness. Magpies defender Jack Madgen looks set for a long stint on the sidelines after hurting his shoulder in the second quarter and was subbed out for Finlay Macrae. The Bulldogs will have an opportunity to even the ledger at 5-5 next weekend when they host Gold Coast in Ballarat, while Collingwood (4-5) travel to Perth Stadium to face Fremantle.

2,"Broncos run riot in Magic Round, thumping the abject Sea Eagles 38-0",sport," Sport Brisbane Broncos beat Manly Sea Eagles 38-0 on opening night of NRL Magic Round For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Adam Reynolds has channelled Allan Langer as Brisbane turned back the clock with a historic 38-0 thrashing of Manly. Exactly one year ago Reynolds arrived in Brisbane for the NRL's Magic Round with South Sydney, almost miserably explaining why he had chosen the long-term security of the Broncos over a one-year extension at his childhood club. On Friday any misery was a distant memory, the captain as delighted as the 40,267-strong Magic Round crowd as he orchestrated a romp that included a Selwyn Cobbo hat-trick. Corey Oates also scored twice in the Broncos' fourth-straight win, something that's alluded them since 2017, and confirms Kevin Walters' improving side's position in the top eight. Victory follows wins over top-four side Cronulla and last year's finalists Souths, with a top-four position now in their sights ahead of games against Newcastle (13th), Gold Coast (15th) and Canberra (12th). It also came a year after the Broncos' biggest ever loss to Manly, the 50-6 drubbing a marker of how far the 2020 wooden spooners have come in 12 months. Prized recruit Reynolds was in the middle of it, twice putting in pinpoint cross-field kicks for Cobbo, while the 19-year-old winger also reeled in an intercept and raced 95 metres for his third try. The halfback also looked after himself, collecting his own Langer-like short chip and scooting over to cap a brilliant first half. The writing was on the wall from the kick-off for Manly, who allowed the ball to bounce 15 metres over the dead ball line. Brisbane collected the short re-start and Reynolds obliged when Reuben Garrick strayed off his wing, kicking for Cobbo's first. Possession swung heavily in Brisbane's favour but their improved defence was up to task when necessary, Billy Walters somehow holding out Tom Trbojevic after he had caught a bomb and landed on the tryline. Their attack was otherwise clunky, Trbojevic managing soreness in his well-strapped knee and brother Ben suffering a shoulder injury. Oates' second try, cutting back through some soft defence, sealed Brisbane's biggest-ever win over the Sea Eagles. But with two Kurt Capwell's efforts denied on review, the second a line-ball forward pass, the damage could have been worse. Brisbane's forwards were also dominant, with Pat Carrigan (156m) one of five Brisbane forwards with 100-plus run metres. AAP The Newcastle Knights climbed off the bottom of the ladder, beating Canterbury 16-6 in an underwhelming opening act at Lang Park. The Knights and Bulldogs acted their ranks (16th and 15th respectively) as they fumbled their way through 80 minutes of NRL football. The Bulldogs, having only last week been usurped by Newcastle for 16th spot on the ladder, went straight back down there thanks to 13 errors with the ball and more than twice as many missed tackles without it, according to Stats Perform. Despite the win, coach Adam O'Brien, who stormed out of the box after lock Leo Thompson bombed a second-half try, will be none too pleased by how close the game was. His team had 57 per cent of the ball, dominated the offload count 9-1 and broke twice as many tackles as their opponent. Edrick Lee scored first for the Knights off a questionable pass from centre Bradman Best, before Josh Addo-Carr answered back for the Dogs. With the teams locked at 6-6 at half-time, it took only seven minutes for Best to break the deadlock after fullback Kalyn Ponga scooted past an over-committed Bulldogs defender. It was a rare highlight on a down night for the out-of-form Knight custodian. Newcastle were awarded two more tries, only for the bunker to overrule, but the video referee could not deny Adam Clune's solo game-breaker with five minutes left in the game.

3,'Happiest day of her life': Girl overjoyed to continue playing in footy comp after AFL exemption ,sport,"  AFL grants exemption to 14-year-old Victorian girl to play footy with boys in mixed comp For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency After missing four games, Abby Weir took to the oval for the first time this season after the AFL granted her an exemption to play in mixed-gender competitions. Previously, an AFL rule that governed female participation meant that Abby was prohibited from playing in her local mixed-gender division because she was female and turning 15 this year. The rule prevents females from participating in mixed-gender football if they are 14 years old by January 1 in the year of play. According to an AFL policy, this rule is in line with the Commonwealth Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which allows people aged 12 and above to be excluded from participating in sporting activities where the strength, stamina and physique of players are relevant. This gender rule is separate from the age rule within the AFL that prevents players from any gender from playing with a team if they are over age. For example, a 13-year-old child on an under-12 team. Actual rule: ""Pursuant to section 42(1) of the Act, people of one gender aged 12 and over can be excluded from participating in competitive sporting activities in which the strength, stamina and physique of competitors is relevant. AFL members will exclude females who reach 14 years of age as at January 1 in the year of play from playing in any competition that is not a 'female competition'."" Abby's mother Melissa Weir said when Abby found out she got the exemption she said, ""It was the happiest day of her life"". Abby has been playing with St Arnaud Football Club since she was six, in line with Weir family tradition. ""The [boys] haven't really singled me out in anything we've done, so it's really just I'm a part of the team,"" Abby said. She said boys on opposition teams were also used to playing with girls as there were other girls younger than her playing in the under-14 division. The AFL's Central Victorian regional manager, Craig Armstead, said after numerous discussions about insurance and governance AFL Victoria gave North Central Football League, in which Abby played, the authority to grant an exemption on a case-by-case basis. Considering the shortage of players in community sport, the remoteness and travel distance required to play in a female-only competition, the North Central Football League granted Abby the exemption. ""There were cheers from the change rooms when she was called out in the team on the Thursday night at training,"" Ms Weir said. Mr Armstead said while exemptions for being over age were quite common he was not aware of any other exemptions granted with respect to gender, and Abby's case could be one of the first. However, he also said despite Abby's outcome exemptions on a gender basis were not automatic, and players or families still needed to apply. Abby said she would love to continue playing with St Arnaud and move into the under-17 competition, which was exclusively male, as she got older. ""It's kind of nice, the feeling of taking down a boy that's a lot taller and stronger than you,"" she said. ""As the coach says, 'The bigger they are, the harder they fall', which is good."" But Mr Armstead said further discussions were needed to decide whether she could play next year. Mr Armstead said there were a few girls in Central Victoria who were in similar situations to Abby because more girls were starting to play footy from a young age and continued to senior levels. Ms Weir said at least 10 parents of other children in similar situations reached out to her, including the mother of a boy who had to stop playing netball because he reached the age limit. ""It has created a lot of conversations among people which, at the end of the day, is what we wanted,"" she said. ""Country sport is, unfortunately, something that is declining in numbers and when you've got kids on the sidelines purely because of their gender it just doesn't seem right. ""I've spoken to some really wonderful people at AFL House, AFL Central Victoria, the North Central [Football League] who understand our fight in wanting this for kids, and I just hope we can continue to have those conversations."" Mr Armstead said as much as girls wanted to continue playing in boys' competitions it was important that the decision was made in consultation with the parents. ""The reality is [girls] could be playing against 17-year-old boys and so some parents aren't as comfortable with that,"" he said.

4,The life and death of City v Country — how the legacy of league's much loved rep game lives on,sport,"  Campo's Corner: The life and death of City v Country — how the legacy of league's much loved rep game lives on For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tariq Sims did the same thing every single year. He'd mark out his goals for the season to come, and he'd always aim high – premiership wins, New South Wales Origin jerseys, all the dreams you can imagine. But before he could do any of that, something else had to come first. Because before Sims was a Blue, before he was a Dragon or a Knight or a Cowboy, before he was anything else in football, he was a Gerringong Lion. He was from the country, and that meant a lot. So Sims turned up, again and again, for Country Origin in their annual clash with City. From 2012, when he debuted, until 2017, when the game finally faded away, he was there. Towards the end, plenty of NRL players pulled out, either through their own volition or after pressure from their clubs, who feared injuries for their stars and in the end caused the death of this match that was once a staple of the rugby league calendar. But Sims never did. Not ever. He finished with six caps for Country Origin, one short of Laurie Daley's record of seven, and he's as proud of that as he is anything he has done in rugby league. ""Going away for the week, immersing yourself in the history of the jersey and giving back to the country, representing the people from the bush, there was nothing like it,"" Sims says. ""Pulling on that maroon jersey with the gold V, that was so special to me. It was a stepping-stone to Origin, a chance to prove yourself, and playing against other New South Welshmen in the City team, personally it felt like one of the real rivalries. ""Once you're committed you have to give it your all. That's the bush mentality, you can't do things half-arsed, you have to go out there and have a go. ""We played with our heart on our sleeve, and we wanted to play tough, we wanted to be a team the country could be proud of."" First played in 1911, by the end of City-Country's long life span it was regarded as a remnant of a world which no longer existed, a holdover from a different era of rugby league, when country footy and the Sydney competition were of truly comparable quality and somebody could still earn state or national selection by playing anywhere in New South Wales. The slow decline of the country competitions and the gradual rise of the Sydney premiership into the NRL we know today, meant City-Country became something else — a trial for a New South Wales Origin berth and an opportunity to represent one's hometown or suburb on a big stage. Then slowly, bit by agonising bit, this game was chipped away until, five years ago, it was ended as a top-line match. Rugby league hasn't been the same since, because the secret truth of City-Country was that it was always more than it was said to be — it wasn't just a selection trial, or a game on a Sunday afternoon, it was a celebration of some of the game's most unheralded heroes, a week of recognition for parts of this sport that are so often overlooked. Like the pre-season All Stars game, the match itself was as much a culmination as it was a showpiece. Winning the game mattered, and playing well mattered, but the community work during the week, inspiring the next generation and connecting with the people who keep the game alive in the bush, was just as crucial. That's why it still had meaning to the end, even if the stars didn't come out for it like they once did and it was easy to sneer at a game that had, to many, lost a lot of cachet. But when you were in town when City-Country was on and you could see what it meant in person, then the value of the game was easy to understand. Plenty of the game's critics wouldn't take that trip over the mountains or up or down the coast or into the west. You don't need to be from the country to understand what the jersey meant, you just have to be from somewhere and be proud of it. ""I always pride myself on how I represent where I'm from, my family, my junior team, my mates. To pull that jersey on, it really does mean something to you, and it gives hope to kids from the bush when they see you wear it,"" Sims says. ""It's not that often that NRL teams play in the bush, for kids to see a game live was a big deal to them. Inspiring the next generation of kids coming through, that played a big part in what you were trying to represent. ""Maybe we went to their school, or they came to the game and met a player afterwards, and maybe that's what inspired them to chase their dream. That was something that always stood out to me."" The NRL has compensated for the loss of City-Country by playing more games in regional areas, which are, in their own right, important to keeping the game alive in country New South Wales. But there's a difference between having a game in one town and having a team playing for the entire bush. A single game can only be played in one place at a time, but a rep team is different – it's right there in the name. They represent something much larger than just one place. It doesn't just inspire kids, it lifts up everyone around the game. Sims could always feel that through his long career for Country, no matter if the game was played in Mudgee, Coffs Harbour, Dubbo or Wagga Wagga. That's the thing about the country – some things are the same wherever you go. ""You don't go in the sheds after the game, you stay on the field and the fans come to you, and it just has that nice country vibe, which I've always really enjoyed,"" Sims says. ""I'm sure it was the same for the City boys when they talked to kids who wanted to be where they were. Out in the country we'd see people who would drive three or four hours just to watch us train. ""It was a big deal to them, and it was a big deal for us to play for them. The people in the bush don't get seen or heard as often as they should, so to go out there and make them proud, it meant a lot to me."" It still does. Sims is 32 and much closer to the end of his career than the start, but if he had the chance he'd pull the Country jersey on without question, so long as they'd have him. ""I'd absolutely play if they still had it. If there was a chance to represent the country it would always be a goal. If the coach picked me I'd be frothing,"" Sims says. ""Being able to represent the bush is always a big deal, and there's a lot of pride there. ""I think if you asked a lot of the Country guys they'd say the same thing – that they have a responsibility to inspire the next generation."" But Sims will never get that chance in the same way again. Neither will the players who come after him. As a top-level match, City-Country is long gone. It wasn't a sudden death. It took years, and it died a little bit at a time via a series of small cuts that added up in the end. A break can be mended, but disintegration cannot. A rope which has been cut can be tied back together, but it cannot be fixed if it's been allowed to rot away. Clubs and coaches stopped allowing their charges to play, citing the risk of injury, which impacted the star power of the game which, in turn, led many to challenge the relevance of the concept in modern age. The catchcry was that the game was no longer a genuine Origin trial, and thus it was considered pointless. But the true benefits were not in dollars and cents, or in giving the Blues coach a form guide, but in hearts and minds that were won and recognised, and in the future the game could inspire. Given we live in a cold world of balance sheets and bottom lines, that was never going to be enough. The game could not be saved in the end, so when it was consigned to the history books at the end of 2017 it was for the best and worst of reasons. Even though rugby league is a sport obsessed with nostalgia, to the point where it can occasionally consume the game and blind it to a better future, that nostalgia does not always seem to apply equally. Every few months there's a story about how bush footy is on it's knees, how it's withering on the vine and being forgotten. You can set your watch to them arriving. There's a lot of truth in most of them, because money is tight and a lot of country towns are declining and it's harder to put a team together than it used to be. Having a week of celebration and recognition, which showed the country was important to rugby league, and the people there did matter, and the millionaires in the ivory towers hadn't forgotten about them and what they did for the game, meant something. The match mattered, and so did everything around it. It was further proof that rugby league as a sport can be so much larger than just the 16 clubs that make up the NRL as the size and scale of the elite competition and the Origin series and the money they generate threaten to swallow up the nooks and crannies that make a sport larger than a single league. Representative football gives rugby league a different flavour, one people always seem to enjoy if they're just given a chance to enjoy it. For proof, look no further than international football, which came so far in the years leading up to COVID before the pandemic slammed the breaks on Test matches. It is only now those types of matches are getting off the ground again, and even then with plenty of resistance from the clubs. Their fear of injury or player burnout is understandable, and clubs looking after their own interests is to be expected, but the game has the potential to be so much larger than 16 teams. City-Country was beyond saving by the end. It's passing was assured many years before the plug was finally pulled. It's easy to consign it to the other novelties of league's past that were left behind when the time came for it, like the Amco Cup or contested scrums. But instead of being a curio or a novelty for the rugby league trainspotter, the end City-Country should instead serve as a warning. This was a game played since 1911, and it meant so much to so many, but if it can be allowed to die then almost can anything can be killed. Selling the country part of City-Country has always been easy. Giving good old boys from the bush a chance to represent the small towns that made them, make their families and communities proud and giving a day in the sun to a part of rugby league so rarely afforded that type of recognition – who could possibly object to it? For City, the equation isn't so simple. Country fellas, for the most part, can find a lot of common ground regardless if they come from Cobar or Forster or anywhere in-between but Sydney, with it's vast sprawl, is harder to get a handle on, especially when it comes to rugby league given the sport was built on tribalism between the different suburbs. Being a country boy can be a way of life, but there's no song called 'Thank God I'm a City Slicker'. Enter Brad Fittler, who became City-Country's great champion in it's final, difficult years. Fittler took over as City coach in 2011 and stayed in charge until the match was wound up at the end of 2017. A seven-time City rep as a player, the match was always important to Fittler. ""It was a game I grew up watching, a game I grew up playing when it was a trial match for Origin. It was always my first step into the next level,"" Fittler says. ""One thing I was very aware of when I got into coaching was the workload on players. I always tried to choose players I thought would benefit from a week in camp, and I thought that worked really well. ""You try to use it as a time to revitalise a career, or give a young bloke a go or give a fella who might be on the way out one last week in camp. I saw a lot of different benefits of the game over different times. ""It was something I always enjoyed, and I enjoyed getting out to the country. I loved getting out there, talking to the people, and I got a real joy in beating them as well."" As NRL stars fell away from the fixture, Fittler never stopped treating the game with the utmost respect. It was a week to be enjoyed, but there was always a game to be won and a jersey to be honoured. ""I remember one day I was calling on the forwards, calling them cats and taking the ball up to them,"" Fittler says. ""When you have (assistant coach) Tony Butterfield next to you and he's five years older and still taking it up you think 'I can't let him do it on his own'. Hanging around Tony Butterfield for a week is always a fun thing to do, he's a good man and very passionate. ""It must have fired them up, because Mitch Allgood, who played for us that year, sat me on my arse. It's a good memory. ""You have to hand it to the players. The prestige didn't run with it like it once did, but they saw how serious I was about the game, and there was always a reason to do it well rather than neglect it and just treat it like another game of footy."" Fittler found small ways to build a bond in the short camp. He would call in fellow City alumni from his playing days and have them speak about the pride of the jersey, how it felt to have become a City man, and how far a good performance could take them. He would take his players into the heart of Sydney, to somewhere like the Hope Street Hostel, and have them cook dinner for those less fortunate. At junior clinics he would send them on to the field with the words ""go out there and change a child's life"". ""One thing I always tried to teach them was the demographics of the city, what happens in there, the good and the bad of the city, and a bit of the history. Just little touches along the way,"" Fittler says. ""We had a great reaction to that, some of my greatest times were coaching City teams, it was always a lot of fun because it was light but they knew there would be rewards for good games, for excellence. ""A lot of players bought in, which surprised me. A lot of coaches didn't buy in, and that didn't surprise me, because I'd been a coach and I'd see that side of it. ""I always tried to be selective, I'd speak to coaches, some pulled players out while others allowed players to come in. It was a tricky one, but I'd like to think we got it right more than we didn't."" The records show Fittler did more than just that. He won three, drew one and lost two of his six matches in charge for City, a remarkable record given he was almost always coaching a heavy underdog. One year he picked Addin Fonua-Blake, only for the NSWRL to rule he was ineligible. Another time he picked a young James Tedesco, who had played just four NRL matches at the time. A couple of years later he picked Ryan Matterson, who'd only played two. Eight other players in the side that year had appeared in less than 40 NRL games. They played against a Country team that boasted Jack Wighton, Isaah Yeo, James Maloney, Jack Bird, Jack de Belin, Tyson Frizell, Boyd Cordner and Dale Finucane, and the City boys won, handily, with guys like Kyle Lovett and Aaron Gray playing blinders in a 44-30 win. But even that couldn't compare to the chaos of the final game in 2017. Things were already looking dicey when Paul Gallen was asked to return from representative retirement for one last ride, to hopefully inspire some players to stick it out. Ten minutes before the side was to be named, a press release was issued saying the announcement would be delayed because City didn't have the numbers. Calls were made across the league for somebody, anybody who grew up in Sydney and wanted to be part of something, to come on down. One of the calls reached Phil Gould at Penrith, who had coached Fittler for club, City and state in the past, and he had the guys for the job. ""I rocked up to Panthers training and the coach called me into his office and asked if I wanted to play for City, and I jumped at it. We all came in midweek, Gal was already there and I joined the group and being part of a side coached by Freddy, that was pretty special,"" then Penrith prop James Tamou says. ""Rep footy is about coming together, and that's hard to do on short notice. It's hard to build connections and trust and everything else in a few days. ""Freddy was big on making those connections. The forwards all went for early morning walks together, for example, and we didn't have to talk about footy, we just had to be together. ""You can't train much, but building those connections is more important and Freddy understands that, that was the secret sauce that brought everyone together."" Even with the addition of Panthers stars Tamou, Matt Moylan, Nathan Cleary, Bryce Cartwright and Tyrone Peachey, City had to dig deep into the bullpen to find a 17 to take on the old rivals one last time. Dragons forward Hame Sele, who had come off the bench in each of his four NRL appearances, started at lock. Two of the subs, Jake Marketo and Pauli Pauli, were picked from reserve grade. Neither man had played a first grade game all year, and between the two of them they would only ever play one more in their careers. But it didn't matter. They were City men, and they were willing and that's all Fittler needed. It wasn't about how good he made them, it's how he made them good. Tamou, in his first and only match for City, played one of the games of his life, Gallen rolled back the years in what proved to be the final rep game he ever played and managed came together in what remains one of the great feats of Fittler's coaching career to down a far more star-studded Country side 20-10 and win eternal bragging rights, because what's already happened can't ever change. ""They were favourites, because our team came together so late, we were almost like a group of bandits that got thrown together and rolled into town. But everyone who put their hand up did a job,"" Tamou says. ""It all came together for us, it all came out that day in Mudgee. ""At that point in time I'd played for Australia and New South Wales, but you never want to stop playing rep footy. If someone rings you up and asks if you want to play City-Country you should say yes straight away. ""It wasn't just a trial match for Origin, it was a rep game on it's own. The passion that comes into it, it's a dream come true for those country blokes and for us as well. It's always been that battle. ""You go to any country town, they want to tear your head off cause you're a city boy. That battle has always been there. It was sad to see it go, but it's a jersey I'll treasure."" Long after the annual conversations of City-Country being a genuine State of Origin trial have ceased, its impact is still being felt in the game's harshest arena. Of the 64 players who debuted for New South Wales between 2010 and 2020, 56 of them played City-Country. Even that last day in Mudgee proved to be a hotbed of future Blues stars despite so many withdrawals as 11 players, including Sims, Cleary, Damien Cook, Josh Addo-Carr, Cody Walker and Dale Finucane, went on to play for New South Wales in the years since ""Even though we're playing against other New South Welshmen we all did the same moves and same plays so once we did get into Origin it was seamless,"" says Sims, who made his Origin debut the year after City-Country wrapped up and has gone on to appear five times for the Blues under Fittler. ""There was no gelling period, we just jumped straight in. We already knew what was needed, we knew what was required to perform at that level. ""It's a great stepping stone to that level."" But City-Country was more than the making of the players – it was the making of Fittler as a coach. Given Fittler now has the same win percentage in charge of the Blues as Gould, it's easy to forget his stock as a coach was not high when he took over City ten years ago. His time in charge of the Roosters was tumultuous and inconsistent, and by his own admission he was far from the coach he would become. But plenty of the hallmarks that have helped him become one of the state's most decorated coaches were honed during his time with City. All the Fittler trademarks – like forcing players to bond by asking them to stay off their phones, forging strong links to the community to give the people they're representing a human face, giving players the support to play their natural game and the confidence to execute it under pressure – aren't just inventions he cooked up once he took the big job. Before Fittler asked his Blues players to go to a corner of Lang Park or Stadium Australia and think about every person who got them where they are today, the people they were playing for once they got out there, he asked his City players to do the same at the Glen Willow Sportsground in Mudgee. ""A lot of times our team maybe wasn't as strong as theirs, but we were always very competitive and it gave me confidence that it works, the stuff I did worked,"" Fittler says. ""If the players wanted to have a go, they could have a go. It gave me confidence. ""Speaking to Paul Gallen, after the game he played at the end, I think he surprised himself with how much he enjoyed it. ""In a lot of the camps we had a lot of fun. It was almost the last of the camps where you could have a good night out like it used to be."" While Fittler holds many fond memories of City-Country, and was the game's greatest advocate during it's last days, he knows it won't ever return in it's old form. ""I'm nearly on the other side now. I understood towards the end, how delicate it is with players, but we never had many injuries, I think Matt Moylan broke his thumb one year but that's about it,"" Fittler says. ""I was always grateful we got through it unscathed, because there's a big workload on the players."" It is how it is, Fittler says, and besides – the game isn't dead. Not all the way, anyway. ""They run it in the juniors now, my young bloke is playing in the City 16s this weekend,"" he says. ""It still has a purpose."" Zach Fittler will indeed emulate his father and wear the blue and gold of City this Saturday at Brookvale Oval. The Under 16s clash is part of the revamped City-Country weekend, which the NSWRL introduced last year. The NRL players won't be there, even if they wished they could be, because the NRL is holding it's Magic Round on the same weekend. But there will be more maroon and gold and blue and yellow than you could ever ask for with Under 16s, boys and girls Under 18s, men's and women's police, physical disability and wheelchair matches to be played, as well as men's and women's opens games. The women's game will have some of the NRLW's biggest stars, because it is still a true fight for Blues spots, but the men's game won't quite have the same shine. City will be represented by the best of the Ron Massey Cup, which sits a tier below reserve grade, while Country is made up of players from all over the bush. It's back to the old ways, residential rules, and the passion is still there. ""People might belittle you and say it's not an Origin trial,"" says Hamish Oxley, who played for Country in 2021. ""But getting to wear that jersey was the proudest thing I've ever done in football. I understand it's not an Origin trial or anything like that, and I don't want to sound like a flog, but it makes you feel on top of the world."" Oxley, who plies his trade for Oakdale Workers in the Macarthur Rugby League competition, is a self-described bush footy battler. Last year's Country team, which was thrown together with players from all over the state, was filled with guys just like him. ""I was the only player from my comp who got picked, I roomed with a guy from Cooma, the team was from everywhere but because we're all country guys we have a lot in common. Plenty of them let go of the NRL dream when they were 18 or 19, but they're still weapon footy players,"" Oxley says. ""The whole thing had this real professional feel, we were in camp for seven days and it was one of the best weeks of my life. I was 29, but it makes you feel like a kid, you feel like you've made it. ""You go into a room and see Terry Campese standing there with Beau Scott, two guys who are legends and played for Country. ""They coached the side for free, and they gave us a spiel when we first came into camp that those weeks they spent with the Country side were some of the best weeks of their careers, and they just wanted to give back to country footy. ""They still felt like they owed country footy something. There was a lot of pride."" City got the job done against the bush boys in their meeting last year. It was a bit of a belting as well, with the pride of Sydney running out 38-12 winners. But for proof it wasn't just a week on the piss and a bit of a run around, look no further than the man of the match that day – Soni Luke. Luke has since earned his belated NRL debut with the Panthers. He's living proof City-Country can still be a step towards something greater, even if it's not a sky blue jersey. Penrith's Soni Luke rise from park footy to the NRL is an overnight success story years in the making. ""It was a great experience. It was a great stepping stone for me, I got a lot of recognition for it. I still think there's room in the game for it,"" Luke says. ""I got to represent my junior club, St Mary's, and they were wrapped for us. It was so good, I'm really lucky."" Still, things aren't the same as they used to be. There's no more travelling roadshow out to some small country town where the players are welcomed like conquering heroes. Fans don't drive hours just to watch them train anymore. Blues Origin jerseys aren't on the line, and there's no more guns in the valley. But it's still City and it's still Country. The colours are still the same. There is still a clear line that is over a hundred years long which begins all the way back in 1911, and the jersey which was worn by Dally Messenger and Dave Brown, by Clive Churchill and Arthur Beetson, by just about every New South Wales legend who ever played this sport, is still worn today. And so long as the good Lord's willing and the creek don't rise, it'll continue to be worn into the future. The game won't ever be like it once was, but it's still something. The players who head out there over the weekend are the inheritors of all that history and pride and tradition. They're the ones who keep the flame burning, because it lives in them now, as it lived in so many legends before them. ""Growing up I idolised David Peachey, adored the bloke, and this was the game he made his own, he only played one Origin but he played for Country and dominated. I have that link with him now,"" Oxley says. ""I didn't score a try, but I kicked a couple of goals. I walked away from the ground thinking 'f**k, I scored points for country' and even though we lost it put the biggest smile on my face. ""I'm a part of Country history. I'm in the scorebook with some of my heroes. It's surreal.""

5,AFLW players still in the dark over collective bargaining agreement as pre-season nears,sport,"  AFLW players still in the dark over collective bargaining agreement as proposed August start date nears For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency AFL Players Association president Patrick Dangerfield suggests patience could pay off for AFLW players amid growing frustration around the speed of negotiations over a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The women's competition will expand to 18 teams for its seventh season, which is slated to begin in the last week of August, leading into the men's finals series. Pre-season is due to start in June but there is still no CBA in place, with the length of the deal and length of the season believed to be key sticking points. ""I'd prefer to get the right deal than rush a deal through that the players aren't happy with, or something that isn't fair,"" Dangerfield said on Friday. ""I don't think what we're asking for is unreasonable, but it's got to be reflective of the input our female players have in the game, the work that they put in. ""As much as we all want certainty around that, it's got to be the right deal."" Most AFLW players say they eventually want a full-length home-and-away season, but the league has so far been reluctant to commit to more than 10 rounds plus finals. Dangerfield said the length of the season and remuneration for players are key focuses for the AFLPA in negotiations. ""Finances are a really important part of this,"" Dangerfield said. ""You've got to be rewarded for the time that you put in and, if we expect the game to improve, then you've got to invest in that part of it. ""There's detail around that that's being worked through and then there's clearly the length of season. ""I'm not going to go into specifics of what's more important, but my personal view is rewarding the players for the time that they put in — with the vast majority of players having external jobs as well — and getting the balance right."" As yet, there has been no official confirmation around dates for AFLW player signing periods, the draft or the season schedule. Several players have taken to social media in recent weeks to vent their frustration at the lack of information provided by the AFL, particularly as the organisation appears to prioritise planning for the men's league. However, on Friday, outgoing AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said clubs were last week given indicative dates to work with. ""The season will be starting in that last weekend of August, coming into the men's [finals],"" McLachlan told 3AW radio. ""I know that the clubs and our female players, as we go to 18 teams this season, want to know exact specifics. ""We've just got to get this deal done with the Players Association … but we'll get there.""

6,Dani Laidley arrest saga comes to close with charges against police officer dropped,sport,"  All charges dropped against Victoria Police officer who shared details of Dani Laidley's 2020 arrest For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A two-year saga that filled tabloid pages has drawn to a close with the charges against the last police officer involved in the leaking of Dani Laidley's arrest dropped. Constable David Hall was charged with two counts of unauthorised disclosure of police information for sharing details of the former North Melbourne Football Club coach's arrest in May 2020. The charges were struck out in the Ringwood Magistrates' Court on Friday morning. It comes after two other police officers implicated in the scandal also had their charges dropped earlier this year. Detective Leading Senior Constable Murray Gentner — accused of accessing Ms Laidley's arrest record and sharing it in a Whatsapp group — successfully challenged six criminal charges levelled at him. Senior Constable Shane Reid was cleared of four charges in April after admitting to taking a photo of Ms Laidley during her arrest and sharing it. Ms Laidley had been arrested for stalking, and was spared a conviction and placed on an adjourned undertaking instead. Ms Laidley launched legal action in Victoria's Supreme Court following the scandal which outed her as transgender, claiming Victoria Police was liable for the alleged actions of three police officers. Chief Commissioner Shane Patton publicly apologised following the incident and said that Victoria Police had done the wrong thing. ""It was a breach of Dani's human rights, it's inappropriate conduct, it's not acceptable,"" he told ABC Melbourne radio. Ms Laidley reached a confidential settlement with Victoria Police over the leak in March.

7,Aussie beach volleyballers chasing Commonwealth Games gold,sport,"  Aussie beach volleyballers Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar chasing Commonwealth Games gold For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Olympic silver medallists Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar have set their sights on winning gold at this year's Commonwealth Games. The duo have been named as Australia's female pairing for Birmingham 2022, where they will seek to improve on their silver medals at the Commonwealth Games in 2018 and last year's Tokyo Olympics. ""I'm grateful for another chance to wear the green and gold, and to represent my people,"" said Clancy, the first Indigenous player to represent Australia in beach volleyball. ""Sport is an incredible place to showcase our beautiful culture, and the Commonwealth Games is no different. ""Mariafe and I really want to turn our silver from the Gold Coast in 2018 into gold. ""I can't wait to get over there and show the world what we're made of."" It will be the second Commonwealth Games for Clancy and del Solar, and also for fellow volleyballer Chris McHugh, with all three having featured when the sport debuted on the Gold Coast. McHugh will be paired in this year's competition with Paul Burnett as Australia aim to defend the gold medal won four years ago. The men's pair tested their combination at the Asian Beach Volleyball Championships last November and McHugh, who won the inaugural Commonwealth Games beach volleyball competition with the now-retired Damien Schumann, is excited about their prospects heading into Birmingham. ""The gold medal on the Gold Coast was a phenomenal achievement for Damo and myself, and that will stay with us forever,"" McHugh said. ""But this is a new team, with Paul playing at his first Commonwealth Games, and we have our own goals that we are striving every day to achieve.""

8,Former NZ captain Brendon McCullum named England test head coach,sport,"  Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum named England Test head coach For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum has been appointed head coach of England's test team, the country's cricket board said on Thursday. McCullum replaced Chris Silverwood who left the role in February after England was thrashed 4-0 in the Ashes in Australia. Paul Collingwood stepped in as a caretaker coach. McCullum, 40, is currently in charge of Indian Premier League Twenty20 side Kolkata Knight Riders. But the England and Wales Cricket Board said he would be in place to start his role when New Zealand visited for a three-test series starting at Lord's on June 2. ""We are delighted to confirm Brendon as England men's test head coach. It has been a real privilege to get to know him and understand his views and vision for the game,"" board managing director Rob Key said in a statement. ""He has a recent history of changing cricket culture and environments for the better, and I believe he is the person to do that for England's red-ball cricket. ""We were incredibly fortunate to have a seriously strong list of quality candidates for the post, with Brendon demonstrating he was our number one choice."" Former South Africa and India head coach Gary Kirsten had been linked with the role, while Collingwood was also considered. McCullum played the last of his 101 tests at Christchurch in 2016 against Australia, where he hit the fastest ever century in the format (54 balls). He finished his career with 6,453 runs including 12 hundreds and 31 half-centuries. He will be tasked with working alongside newly-appointed test captain Ben Stokes to get England out of a slump after the team won only one of their last 17 matches. Key described the pairing as a ""formidable coach and captain partnership"". McCullum said he understood the job ahead. ""In taking this role on, I am acutely aware of the significant challenges the team faces at present, and I strongly believe in my ability to help the team emerge as a stronger force once we've confronted them head-on,"" McCullum said. ""Ben Stokes is the perfect character to inspire change around him, and I look forward to working closely with him to build a successful unit around us."" Former England captain Michael Atherton said McCullum was a ""very bold and imaginative choice"" by managing director Key. Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast. Apart from coaching the Kolkata IPL franchise, McCullum also worked with their sister team, Trinbago Knight Riders, in the T20 Caribbean Premier League. Atherton said McCullum's limited coaching experience was not a concern. ""His limited coaching experience has come in the IPL… But he did play 100 tests, scored a test match triple hundred and he was very significant in test cricket in his own right,"" Atherton said. ""… As a captain and as a leader, he's got plenty of experience in test match cricket.""

9,Mick Malthouse the latest to throw support at Wahgunyah footy club after 431-point loss,sport,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A growing number of AFL stars are lending a hand at local football clubs that are struggling to bounce back from the impacts of COVID. The latest to offer support is three-time premiership coach and former St Kilda and Richmond player Mick Malthouse who got wind of Wahgunyah's struggles. Wahgunyah lost by a record-breaking 431 points in round five against Beechworth after 16 players were ruled out with COVID. Wahgunyah young gun Tristan Anderson scored the only point for the team, while Beechworth had over 100 shots on goal, slotting 66 for a score of 432. It was the second time this season that the club broke the record for the biggest losing margin following a loss to Dederang only weeks earlier, in round one, by 358 points. Malthouse will host the seniors' training session on May 26 during a fundraising event. Winners of a raffle will be given the opportunity to enjoy breakfast with the champion coach and player the following morning, and other entertainment including a Q&A will be held throughout the night. Club president Darryl Hore said, like many clubs, it was feeling the pinch from dwindling player numbers. ""[Wahgunyah] is an area where the population isn't growing and we do support four teams in very close proximity,"" he said. Mr Hore said the response after the huge losses and depleted player stocks was ""unbelievable"". ""It's fantastic. If we chose to forfeit then none of this [support] would be happening,"" he said. ""But our player group decided, once again, that we've got players so lets at least field a senior team."" The dates have also been locked in for former AFL legends to play a one-off game for struggling clubs across the state as part of a beer company promotion. The Longwood Football Netball Club was one of those calling for more to be done after many were forced to fold as they struggled to bounce back after the pandemic. Longwood, a small town of about 200 people between Seymour and Shepparton, has not won a game since 2019. ""We beat Ardmona by about three goals I think,"" senior coach Mick Galvin said. ""It's been a long time between drinks."" Club president Rick Shiner said after overcoming significant financial debt, the club still struggles with player recruitment and the ongoing impacts of COVID. ""[COVID] is going to tear the guts out of any side,"" he said. ""Here you don't have the depth to fill those spots. It's hard enough to fill one or two [fill-in players], but when you have to fill nearly 13 of them it becomes insurmountable."" He hopes the presence of Geelong premiership player Cam Mooney on July 23 will generate enough excitement to put the club on the radar. ""It's just great to have exposure and have people talk about your club and people coming down to have some interest in your club,"" he said. After winning its second game for the season last weekend, North Wangaratta is hopeful the presence of St Kilda and Essendon Star Brendan Goddard in round 15 will maintain the momentum. ""It will be massive for the club,"" assistant senior coach Chris Vaccaro said. North Wangaratta club president Allan Ely also hopes it will have a positive impact on player numbers. ""Hopefully you get a few thousand through the gate and we might be able to steal some players [for] next year,"" he said. The club was without a home ground for three years after its soil was found to be contaminated with lead poisoning from a neighbouring gun club. ""We lost about 30 players over that period due to just not having a home facility. Guys wanted a home base, and not having that it was hard,"" Mr Vaccaro said. Sponsors pulled out resulting in financial impacts, and the club was losing by an average of 200 points every week as it was scraping to find enough players to field a side. ""I got a sore neck just watching the goals go over my head. It was not fun at all,"" Mr Vaccaro said. Mr Ely paid tribute to the club's members and volunteers, who he said were the club's backbone. ""The reason we're here now is because of our supporters, members, volunteers, and committee. Everyone got around each other,"" he said. ""If it wasn't for them we wouldn't be here."" Initiatives like these are hoped to generate more interest in community sport and bolster player numbers, but the clubs said ongoing support was needed for their survival.

10,Brooke Peris gives Hockeyroos the advantage in Trans-Tasman series against Black Sticks,sport,"  Brooke Peris fires Hockeyroos to 2-1 win over New Zealand's Black Sticks to take series advantage For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Brooke Peris, cousin of Australian gold medallist Nova Peris, has pounced twice to edge the Hockeyroos past the Black Sticks 2-1 in the second game of their four-match Trans-Tasman Series in Auckland. Captaining the Australian women's hockey team in her 184th international, Peris scored in the first quarter and again in the last. Her goal three minutes from full-time decided the outcome after Olivia Shannon had drawn the home side level in the 39th minute. Hockeyroos coach Katrina Powell went in with the same 18 players who drew 2-2 in the opening match of the series on Tuesday, with Aleisha Power starting in goal in place of Jocelyn Bartram. Forced to come from behind in game one, the Hockeyroos found themselves ahead in the 13th minute on Thursday night's clash. A low, hard drag flick from Maddy Fitzpatrick from a penalty corner was blocked by goalkeeper Kirsten Nation and Peris was perfectly positioned to produce a world-class first-time strike. The play was delayed momentarily in the second quarter when Rosie Malone was struck in the wrist by a firmly-hit ball at close range, the midfielder in visible discomfort as she came from the field and she played no further part in the match. A piece of individual brilliance inside the attacking circle from Shannon in the 39th minute locked the scores up at 1-1. But it was the Hockeyroos who finished the game stronger and appeared the more likely to snatch a winner. Their reward came in the 57th minute when they took the ball from one side of the field to the other before Jane Claxton's ball into the circle bobbled off the stick of Black Sticks captain Megan Hull and bounced past teammate Ani Roberts allowing Peris to swoop and smash the ball home. Both the women's and men's hockey teams are in their final stages of preparation before the Commonwealth Games in August, with the Kookaburras aiming to secure their seventh straight gold medal. The Hockeyroos will also take part in the World Cup in July. Match three of the Trans-Tasman Series is on Saturday May 14 at 1.35pm AEST, while the final match of the series will take place at the same time on Sunday. All games are streamed live at LIVEHockey.

11,Aussies teams face crunch time as Super Rugby Pacific finals loom on horizon,sport," Sport Australian teams face crunch time as Super Rugby Pacific finals loom on horizon For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Super Rugby Pacific is building nicely towards its crescendo, and all five Australian sides are still well and truly in the hunt for a play-off berth with three rounds of the competition to play. In the case of the Brumbies, the Waratahs and the Reds, the stakes remain high with all three eyeing off top-four finishes. The Brumbies sit second on the table and could even finish the home-and-away rounds as minor premiers. The eight-team finals format was criticised when first announced, with two thirds of the competition being eligible, but with no positions decided with three games to go there is no question the anticipation and intrigue around the run to the play-offs has built as the season has played out. There are a host of games in each round to play — at least four in this weekend's round 13 — that will impact positions on the table as the finals near, and it is possible at this stage that both the top four and the broader top eight will not be decided until the final round in a fortnight. With the much-improved showing from the Australian sides against New Zealand opposition in 2022, it feels like the competition has taken on new life in the back half of the season. The top two could be decided over the next two games, with the Brumbies hosting the third-placed Crusaders and first-placed Blues on consecutive weekends at Canberra Stadium. There is a feeling Friday night's clash against the Crusaders might be the biggest game in Canberra since the 2020 Super Rugby AU final, with strong throwback themes to the glory days of the early 2000s when the the two sides seemed to face off in finals and semi-finals annually. Pies and buckets of chips have been slashed back to 2004 prices for the game, a nod to the year the sides played out an epic final on front of a then-record Canberra Stadium crowd. Roadside ""Vote 1 Brumby Jack"" corflutes are certainly standing out amid an election campaign that people can't wait to see end. ""There's no harder task than going up against the Crusaders, so we can't get carried away with ourselves,"" Brumbies prop James Slipper said in Canberra this week. Slipper will play his 50th match for the Brumbies this week, after relocating from Queensland at the start of the 2019 season. Having chalked up 150 Super Rugby games only recently, he knows enough about the Crusaders from his days at the Reds. ""They're a team that really crucify you if you make mistakes,"" Slipper said. ""Limiting their opportunities is going to be key for us, and that's us executing under pressure and taking big moments in the game, because those opportunities will come. It's up to us whether we want to take them or not. ""We're just going to have to be big in the collision area and at [the] set-piece."" That has certainly been true of late, with the Brumbies' set-piece being their literal foundation to play from since losing to the Reds back in round eight. Brumbies skipper Allan Ala'alatoa is back after missing a few games, but the scrum has remained strong without him. Their line-out drive has returned to its most lethal routes with five rolling-maul tries in the last four games. Their depth and rotations will be tested however, with Noah Lolesio and Rob Valetini both ruled out this week. The Waratahs, fifth on the table, have a similar record to the fourth-placed Chiefs. They knocked off the Crusaders before beating Moana Pasifika in Auckland last weekend and are growing in confidence. Saturday night's match-up with the Hurricanes is a mouth-watering one and hopes of another massive home crowd on the Leichhardt Oval hill await. The Waratahs have the Highlanders and Blues to follow and are very much eyeing off a top-four finish with the view that hosting a quarter-final at home gives them a definite edge. ""I think it's critical to our season,"" Wallabies and New South Wales prop Angus Bell said this week. ""We said a few weeks ago we were looking down the ladder this year but now we're looking up. We want to see how far we can go and how deep we can get into this competition. ""We think that getting a home final at Leichhardt or somewhere in Sydney would give us the best opportunity to do that. ""We're really pushing hard for that top-four spot and we're really looking forward to the challenges ahead."" It's much the same story in Queensland, where the Reds are desperate to turn around three straight losses since the start of the trans-Tasman section of the competition. They are still only one point off the Chiefs after their strong start to the season. A home final is still in their crosshairs. Playing the table-topping Blues in Eden Park in Auckland looms as about as big a challenge as there is in Super Rugby Pacific this season, but having Wallabies fly-half James O'Connor back in the Queensland number 10 jersey will certainly help. ""We haven't won there for 10 years,"" Reds captain Tate McDermott said in Brisbane. ""It's a really good opportunity. We've got a three-week block here leading into the finals, which we will be a part of, but for us it's about where we want to play that play-off match, really. ""It doesn't get any easier. We've had to get back on the horse after the result on the weekend, so there's fair bit of motivation for us for this game."" All the Australian sides — the Western Force and Melbourne Rebels included — can have a positive impact on their ladder positions this weekend. And if that's not enough to push fans along to the rugby this weekend, Slipper hopes the lure of canteen bargains might be enough. ""The Brumbies faithful really get behind us and we feel everything they give us, so if we can get as many out there as possible, to get some cheap pies and chips in, I'll join them after the game and tuck in as well,"" he said.

12,Ange Postecoglou silences critics the only way he knows how — by winning,sport," Sport Ange Postecoglou silences doubters with superb debut season in Europe, claiming Scottish Premiership with Celtic For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency We shouldn't have been surprised. In fact, plenty of Australian football fans will say they foresaw this success for Ange Postecoglou, even if the rest of the footballing world barely disguised their lack of faith. And yet, Postecoglou has silenced those European sceptics to lead Celtic to a thoroughly deserved Scottish Premiership title at the first time of asking, clinching the title with a 1-1 draw away to Dundee United. Twelve months ago even the hardiest of Celtic fans would have had a hard time believing this was possible. Celtic were at a low ebb, without a manager and facing a resurgent Rangers that had comprehensively ended their tilt at a tenth successive title, beating Celtic into second by 25 points. Bitter rivals Rangers, under Steven Gerrard, won that year's Premiership with a whopping six games to go — the earliest a side has ever won the league. It was the first season since 2009/10 that Celtic had failed to win a trophy. Players were leaving, the fans were off side and their biggest rivals were on the up: hardly a good time for an enigmatic and underrated coach from Australia to take charge of one of Europe's biggest clubs, one would think. And yet for Postecoglou, perhaps it was. After all, his style demands total buy in, a sea change in belief and style that can only come when a club is, perhaps open to change. That's what happened in Brisbane with the Roar, which required a wholesale clear out of some of Australian football's biggest names to create a team nicknamed Roarcelona such was their attractive style of play. It happened with Australia too, after the Socceroos had been hammered 6-0 by both Brazil and France in successive matches prior to him taking charge. He led the Socceroos to Asian Cup success in 2015 and World Cup qualification in 2018. It was also the case at Yokahama with an F.Marinos side that had not won a title in 15 years prior to being blessed by the presence of Postecoglou. In Japan, Postecolgou was given time, finishing 12th in his first season before his methods and philosophy permeated through a near-impregnable language barrier to create the free-flowing style that earned them the J-League title the following year. At Celtic, time is not a luxury afforded to anyone. ""This isn't a club that should go years without any trophies,"" Postecoglou told the BBC after winning this year's League Cup with Celtic, ending a brief trophy drought. ""My first task when I took the role was to give the fans hope. ""I couldn't guarantee success, but I could give them hope."" He couldn't guarantee success, but he sure has delivered it, overhauling a cavernous points deficit to Rangers from the previous year to fly past and win with a game to spare. Managing Celtic was a challenge unlike anything Postecoglou had ever faced in his extensive, 26-year managerial career to date. Such is the relative strength of Glasgow's Old Firm, matches between the pair are what count, with the rest of the 12-team league expected to be swatted aside with ease. Every club hopes for success. Few demand it. Rangers and Celtic, the two enormous fish in the ever-shrinking Scottish Premiership pond, are expected to win the title every year — Celtic have not finished any lower than second in the league in 27 years. In Old Firm matches this season, honours have been even: Five games in league and cup, two wins apiece and a draw the result. It's in the matches that Celtic have been expected to win that they have bettered Rangers, who struggled in January and February having lost manager Gerrard in November. That's not always been the case with Postecoglou teams due to his adherence to a set style of play with a view to continually develop, rather than eke out wins by any means necessary. That philosophical rigidity only impacted Celtic at the start of the year, when Celtic took just two wins and a draw from eight matches to sit sixth on the ladder. The doubters sharpened their pitchforks, but the squad, bolstered by 14 new signings, were starting to gel and the free-flowing style for which Postecoglou has become synonymous was proving far too much for Scotland's lesser lights. Those new signings have also proved to be a masterstroke by Postecoglou. Six Celtic players were named in the Professional Footballers Association SPL team of the year. Four of them: Cameron Carters-Vickers, Josip Juranović, Jota and Kyogo Furuhashi, were signed by Postecoglou. Kyogo is the most interesting of those signings given he is one of four J-League players that followed Postecoglou from Japan to Europe — moves that raised eyebrows when they were announced. Postecoglou was greeted with heaps of scorn from the British press who cared little about his impressive record in leagues outside the limelight. Former Scotland striker Alan Brazil became something of the face of Scottish football's ignorance with his now infamous TalkSport segment. Rangers legend Ally McCoist, who laughed along with Brazil as he incredulously asked whether Postecoglou's naming as Celtic boss was a ""wind up"", has since eaten his words. ""He's done a great job there and has continued to do a great job,"" the Rangers legend told Sky Sports after Celtic's League Cup win earlier this year. But success at Celtic does not mean winning one Premiership, not by a long shot. If he wants become a legend at Parkhead, he'll need to win next year too. And the year after. And the year after that, with a smattering of cup successes and lengthy European Cup runs thrown in for good measure. Getting on top is almost the easy part of life at one of the Old Firm. Staying there is something else entirely. However, now he's shown his tactical wares in the crucible of Scottish football, Postecoglou will be a marked man for those who lead the big clubs south of the border. There is little doubt that the first managerial casualty of the 2022/23 Premier League season will lead to calls for Postecoglou's style to be blooded in England, particularly if he can lead Celtic deep in the Champions League, as big an ask as that is for a team with a fraction of the budget of the erstwhile Super League wannabes. That will be a different, bigger test again, particularly with financial inequality making measures of success so varied across the league. Would it be unwise to jump straight into that shark pit, as Gerrard has done with Aston Villa and former Celtic man Brendan Rodgers did at Leicester? Perhaps, but there is little doubt that if Postecoglou does opt to go down that route, or is at least given the chance, he will succeed. Because that's what he does and what he continues to do, everywhere he goes.

13,Your team in two lines — the AFL at round eight,sport," Sport From Melbourne to West Coast — your AFL team's position summed up in two lines For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency We've completed a third of the AFL season, and already we are getting close to clean air between the top eight and the rest. But this season has already thrown up different challenges for different sides. Some are struggling to produce their best footy due to things not clicking, others have had big injuries, and others still have had their season upended by COVID. Elsewhere there are three teams at the top who are functioning quite fluently, including the one that is a game clear on the ladder. So how is YOUR team going after eight rounds? Let's take a look at all 18 sides in two lines each — and there's only one place to start. What can be said that hasn't already for the Demons — a 15-game winning streak, the best one-two midfield punch in the league with Clayton Oliver and Christian Petracca, a dynamic ruck pairing of Max Gawn and Luke Jackson, and the scary sense that there are more gears to come. Can they match the likes of Collingwood 2011 and St Kilda 2009 (20 wins in home and away) or even Geelong 2008 and Essendon 2000 (21 wins)? Perhaps — who's going to stop them? The Dockers have surprised just about everyone, and are flying thanks to the quarterbacking of Andrew Brayshaw, the rucking and scoring ability of Sean Darcy, the contested ball-getting of Will Brodie and the best defence in the AFL — and they haven't even had Nat Fyfe around yet. Justin Longmuir's men are primed for a huge run at the top four — and more — but they can't afford any momentum-dragging losses leading into the bye. The big plus for Brisbane in 2022 has been the balance — the Lions have always had an exciting attack, but having Dayne Zorko directing play off half-back has been a key switch early on. The biggest concern for Brisbane is whether Joe Daniher's shoulder can avoid another sub-lux when he returns — but with Lachie Neale back to his elite best and Hugh McCluggage adding crucial goals to his set-up skills, the Lions have a formidable set of attacking weapons, and a prelim looks like the starting point. For all the chat about new recruits like Adam Cerra and George Hewett, it's the full return of three existing players — Patrick Cripps, Charlie Curnow and Sam Docherty — that has been the big lift for the Blues in 2022. If the clearance game and delivery to Curnow and Harry McKay stays strong, the finals drought dating back to 2013 will finally be broken for the Blues. Spirits are high at Geelong after the demolition of the Giants, and the tandem of Jeremy Cameron and Tom Hawkins up forward is proving a stiff test for everyone — but it has been an up-and-down year for the Cats so far. Chris Scott and his team went back to basics to shut down GWS, but if the old, familiar grinding game style from previous years returns, then the old, familiar question will still be there later in the year — will it work in finals? The Swans' apparent upward trajectory has hit a couple of obstacles — the Lions result might have been expected but the loss to the Suns was not. The pieces are there for a proper run at the finals — when the Sydney attack is humming it is capable of overwhelming sides — but the Swans need to address the issues in stoppage clearances and contested possessions that have been visible particularly in the last fortnight. After eight rounds in 2021, St Kilda was 11th, with a percentage of 82.7 — a year on, the Saints are making strides with seventh spot on the ladder, one extra win and a percentage 35 higher. Despite losses to the Power and Demons, St Kilda are building nicely with the three Jacks — Higgins, Steele and Sinclair — and forward focal point Max King giving the Saints a strong hand in the race to make finals for what would be only the second time in 11 seasons. Tom Lynch is monstering defences, Dusty Martin is back on the park, and Maurice Rioli Jr's entree to AFL is both strengthening the Tigers' links with one of the great football dynasties and also fitting in with the kind of high-pressure, dynamic game that is Richmond at its best. So things are on the improve at Tigerland — but let’s wait for the three games either side of the bye (Sydney R11, Port Adelaide R13, Carlton R14) to get a sense of where this team is really at. The Craig McRae era has started well at Collingwood, with the team playing an attack-focused game that is pleasing to the eye and has got early wins on the scoreboard. The Magpies remain a work in progress, and medium- to long-term injuries to Brodie Grundy and Jamie Elliott aren't helping — but there's no disguising the excitement of talents like Nick Daicos and Jack Ginnivan, and even if finals might be a step too far for 2022, the future looks bright for the Pies. The Bulldogs in 2022 have been like a high-performance sports car with a misfiring engine — the absence of Josh Bruce has hurt up forward, skipper Marcus Bontempelli is struggling physically, the back six is being shredded with opposition marks inside 50, and the injury list has just had a few new entries, including forward Cody Weightman. We've had a few recent examples of grand finalists who miss finals the following year — Richmond 2021, GWS 2020, Adelaide 2018 — and there are big danger signs that Western Bulldogs might add to the list. When Ken Hinkley spoke to the media at 0-5 and said teams could lose five games in a row and still make finals, most people shook their heads. It's still an uphill task for the men from Alberton, but if results go on form, the Power could be back to 5-6 going into the bye — if they can keep improving their supply to Jeremy Finlayson and Todd Marshall up forward (and get Charlie Dixon back on the park) the season will start to look a lot brighter. The old saying ""a change is as good as a rest"" could be applied to Hawthorn this season under new coach Sam Mitchell. The Hawks have looked invigorated, and wins over Port Adelaide and Geelong — not to mention holding the Demons to a 10-point margin — showed positive signs. Some pieces of the puzzle — like Dylan Moore, Mitch Lewis and Jai Newcombe — appear to be in place, but a tough loss to the Bombers is a reminder of what stage the Hawks are at, and with Richmond, Brisbane and Fremantle up in the next five weeks, it's a difficult period ahead. A cursory glance at the ladder might suggest business as usual at Gold Coast, but they are playing better than results suggest with their more direct style — the excellent win over the Swans showed the season doesn't have to end for them after round four each year. The impact of Ben King's absence cannot be underestimated, but Levi Casboult is proving to be an inspired addition, Izak Rankine is beginning to hit form and while Jarrod Witts is tapping to Touk Miller, Noah Anderson and co, the Suns have more than a few winnable games on the way. This season has already seen a few revivals from teams, and Matthew Nicks' Crows are one of the surprise ones — already they have three exciting wins and a narrow round-one loss to the Dockers that looks better and better in hindsight. The longer things go, however, the more it seems they faced teams like the Tigers and Bulldogs at the right time — thumpings by GWS and Carlton suggest preseason predictions that had Adelaide finishing between 16th and 18th might be close to the mark. For GWS, this 2022 season is being overshadowed by the unanswered question of coach Leon Cameron's future — so far the team's travails point to his tenure ending after a decade. The Giants' average margin in their six losses is 39.5 points, and while Toby Greene's return from suspension has made a difference, scoring remains a struggle with a goals-to-inside-50 ratio of 1:5, when the top teams are 1:4. The win over Hawthorn may have given some hope to the Bombers after a tough start to 2022, and stories like Peter Wright (third in the Coleman medal) and mature-age sensation Nic Martin have been big positives for the club. A lot of questions remain, however, on the future of players like Dylan Shiel, on coach Ben Rutten, and whether a defence that is giving up an average of 102 points a game is capable of keeping them in the contest week in, week out. The next half-dozen games could be pivotal. Life has not been easy at Arden Street — 30 games into the rebuild, coach David Noble's record is five wins, one draw and 24 losses. This season, the Kangaroos' only win has been against the Eagles at the height of the COVID issues in the west — the last four weeks have seen losses of 68, 60, 50 and 80 points, and with Port Adelaide, Melbourne and St Kilda next up, it's hard to see things easing up soon. The injuries, the COVID avalanche, the nightclub outings, the declining leaders, the repeated need for top-up players, the stats that are down across the board — it's been a perfect storm for the Eagles this season. There are occasional positives, like Jeremy McGovern still picking off attacks in the backline and the thrill of watching Liam Ryan in action — but if you're averaging eight goals a game and conceding 16, the road back is a long and painful one.

14,"AFL Round-Up: Signs of life in round eight, but the big three have kicked away",sport," Sport AFL Round-Up: Essendon stays alive, but Melbourne, Brisbane and Fremantle have kicked away For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Some timely wins have shaken up the race for the finals, but they're all left chasing the breakaway group of three in 2022. Welcome to the AFL Round-Up, where we digest the week that was. The league's three best teams all won again this weekend, with a combined average winning margin of a little over 10 goals. At the moment, there's no doubt there's a gap between Melbourne, Brisbane, Fremantle and the rest. The wins for Brisbane and Fremantle were expected but very professional. Up against the two worst teams in the league in West Coast and North Melbourne, it was important that the job was thoroughly done and the percentage boost was claimed. But what is now routine for Brisbane is still utterly thrilling for Fremantle. The Dockers fans who kitted up for a rare Friday night outing are still just getting to used to this, and are maybe a little fearful that it could all end just as quickly as it has started. They shouldn't worry. Freo now have the best percentage in the AFL, thanks largely to the most stingy defence in the league. That's sustainable, and as the attack continues to improve the blend just gets better. The story was a little different for Melbourne who, it should be stressed, are another level above the Lions and Dockers again. The Dees were pushed by a Saints team that brought impressive physicality and commitment in what was close to their most impressive performance of the year. And yet Melbourne never really looked like losing the game at any point. Logic suggests they'll have to drop one at some point, but right now it's genuinely very hard to imagine how that might happen. The heat on the Bombers before Saturday night's game against Hawthorn was justified. For a team at this stage of its development, and with so much of its talent in a good age bracket, to be keeping company with the likes of North and West Coast was unacceptable. One win doesn't undo all that has come before it, and finals are still likely to remain out of reach in 2022, but for the Dons this game could mean so much. That last-quarter onslaught was everything that can be good about Essendon. When a bit of physicality was added to what is a very polished team, the sky became the limit. Speaking of polish, what about Nic Martin? Even after his blazing start in the league, most probably expected a regression by this stage. After all, why else would so many clubs have overlooked him? The answer to that may be that his gifts aren't immediately obvious in a training environment. It's in game, with the action whizzing around him, that his now-obvious ability to read the play and make good decisions comes to the fore. He's a natural footballer, one who is suddenly key to what remains a promising future for Essendon. It was a week for morale-boosting wins across the board. The Gold Coast Suns have been closer than most would have realised this year, and outplayed Sydney from start to finish. Getting the swagger back into Izak Rankine played a big part in that dominance too. Port Adelaide claimed the most important win of their season so far. Getting a read on the Bulldogs is an impossible task, but the Port forwards certainly held sway. Charlie Dixon looms. How much does Dustin Martin's return impact Richmond's prospects in 2022? It was a solid return to action for Dusty, though in his terms ""solid"" means 23 disposals and two goals. Attacking is not Richmond's issue, but conceding 86 points even in victory might be cause for concern. Big trouble abounds for GWS. There was hope the Adelaide win was a corner turned, but that showing against Geelong was as dispiriting as anything they've put forward this year. The Blues now sit alone in fourth place, and on the balance of the season so far that feels about right. Few teams in the league can match the power of a rampaging Patrick Cripps and Charlie Curnow. Carlton are as entertaining as footy comes right now. Here we take stock of who is leading the race for the season's individual awards. We talked about Nic Martin earlier, and at this stage he ought to be considered ahead of Josh Rachele and Jai Newcombe as the Rising Star front-runner. It's interesting that two of those names are belated selections, overlooked in drafts gone by. The non-traditional pathways have never been more fruitful. Last week, we talked about Brodie Smith's mark and the concussion he suffered as a result of it. Clearly the optics of that concerned the AFL, as somehow Smith's wasn't included in the three official nominees for mark of the week. Luckily for the league, Smith's is now the second best grab of the year so far. Cam Zurhaar's mark against Fremantle has so much of what we look for in a hanger, and will be tough to beat. Picking a goal of the week is tough, as there were no real standouts. We're going to give it to Brennan Cox, who put the finishing touches on a fantastic Freo team effort. Ed Langdon's still remains the goal to beat by our measure.

17,'It's herstory': ParaMatildas embark on first ever CP Women's World Cup,sport," Sport 'It's herstory': ParaMatildas set to begin new chapter for Australian football at first ever CP Women's World Cup For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency On the first day of June in 1988, 11 Australian women walked out onto a scrappy football pitch in the Chinese city of Jiangmen. The air was oppressively hot and sticky with humidity; a normal southern Chinese summer. Thousands of locals in cotton shirts and wide-brimmed hats lined the shallow stands, as curious about Westerners as they were about the sport itself. Many of them were school children who shrieked with delight at every strong tackle or big header. The game itself ebbed and flowed, but ended in a way few expected. The plucky newcomers Australia defeated the myth and might of Brazil thanks to an audacious chip by striker Janine Riddington. Their first FIFA tournament, their first match, their first win. History. Over a quarter of a million people showed up across that seven-day tournament, proving to FIFA that there was a growing appetite for women's football. The first official Women's World Cup was held three years later. It was a game and a moment that former Matildas vice-captain Moya Dodd recalls with pride at a small gathering at Valentine Sports Park in Sydney's west. She remembers being nervous, of course, but more than that, she remembers the sense of occasion. Finally, there they were. And by god, they wanted to put on a show. ""That was the first time FIFA had actually bothered to hold a women's tournament, and Australia were invited,"" Dodd tells the hushed conference room. ""I remember that time so clearly because I was actually the last player in the squad. I wasn't picked, but then someone got injured. So I was the worst player there. ""The day we played Brazil — it was the first time FIFA ever held a women's match, and we were the first match of the whole tournament — I think that was probably my best day in football, not just because we beat them one-nil, but because it was so historic."" Standing beside Dodd is inaugural Matildas captain and cap number one Julie Dolan, a force of history herself, and Rae Dower, Football Australia's first women's football technical adviser. And in front of these pioneers, 12 women in matching green-and-grey tracksuits sit listening, captivated by the Matildas' story and struck by the realisation that they, too, are about to embark on their own history-making moment. Next week, the ParaMatildas — Australia's first women's national team for footballers with cerebral palsy, acquired brain injury, and symptoms of stroke — will take part in the inaugural CP Women's World Cup in Spain. The five-a-side round-robin tournament will see Australia face some of football's powerhouse nations including the USA, Japan, Spain and the Netherlands across 10 days. Although the first CP world ahampionships were held in Denmark back in 1985, it wasn't until this year that female athletes were invited to take part. ""Moya referred to it as being historic — but it's actually herstoric,"" Dower says. ""This is a herstoric moment. The first ParaMatildas team. The first World Cup for women's CP football. ""But you've also got 43 years of the Matildas. We're there with you every step of the way. ""You're already winners. Because you have that place in herstory. ""Take the opportunity to enjoy every single moment. Smile. Breathe. And just go: 'Wow, look at us.'"" Dolan smiles. ""You're an inspiration to all of us,"" she says. ""And you'll still be an inspiration to all of us, no matter what happens."" Rae Anderson knows how it feels to create ""herstory"". The 25-year-old from Wamberal in New South Wales is one of just seven Australian para-athletes to compete at both a summer and winter Paralympics, most recently in the para-alpine skiing at the Beijing Games. But with football as her first love, Anderson says the World Cup is something different altogether. ""Growing up, my idea of sport was all about teams, about family, about community,"" Anderson told ABC. ""As a kid in primary school, soccer was my first sport. I always knew I wanted to compete for Australia; I always told Mum and Dad I'd play for my country one day. ""I didn't quite process as a kid that I had cerebral palsy — and that my dreams were probably not as achievable as 12-year-old me thought. ""It wasn't until year seven that I started finding out about para-sports; as something I could watch and could aspire to be. ""Doing sports like athletics and alpine skiing, they're very individual sports. The Paralympics was a dream and something that's given me so much opportunity and experience … but to finally be part of a team like this, and going to a World Cup for soccer, that's something really special."" Anderson's own story is a testament to the power of visibility and opportunity for athletes with disability. She remembers watching snippets of the 2012 London Paralympics on ABC television, which inspired her to pursue para-sport more seriously. She made her major tournament debut at the Commonwealth Games just two years later, competing in javelin and discus, before being selected for her first Summer Olympics in Rio. She then switched from summer athletics to winter alpine skiing, finishing seventh and 10th in the women's slalom and giant slalom events at the Winter Paralympics earlier this year. These days, Anderson is paying that inspiration forward through her work as a project coordinator with Disability Sports Australia and the Cerebral Palsy Sporting and Recreation Association, which runs 'come and try' sport programs for primary school-aged kids with disability. ""My whole introduction to sport has been about visibility and opportunity,"" she said. ""To see para-sport on tv and in the media, to see athletes with disability in marketing, to see Paralympians at the forefront of big sporting companies and brands — it's amazing. Para-alpine skier Rae Anderson places seventh in the slalom standing category in Beijing, while fellow Australian Melissa Perrine finishes her Paralympic career on an emotional note. ""I definitely look up to the Pararoos. Those boys, there's something about them: it's not just about their playing ability, but their personalities and what they bring to the sport and their enthusiasm for the next generation, especially for us as the female team coming through. ""It's so important for these younger kids to be able to see these role models and know they're still part of society, that they're part of sport, and that it's something they can be one day too."" But it's not just kids who Anderson and her ParaMatildas teammates are inspiring. It's their own coaches, as well. ""Every day I'm with these amazing players, I learn something new,"" inaugural ParaMatildas head coach Kelly Stirton said. ""The passion they have is infectious. It's life skills, it's resilience, it's that never-say-die attitude that they bring; the undefeated attitude the Pararoos and the ParaMatildas have. ""It's always about the athletes for me. They bring so much pride and joy to my life; without them, I wouldn't be here. I don't see myself as a mainstream coach, I see myself as an all-abilities coach, because that's where my passion lies. ""I can make a difference with these girls and they can make a difference for the world."" Stirton began as a game development coordinator for Capital Football, working mostly with powerchair athletes, before becoming the first woman to coach a team at the CP national championships back in 2019. That's where she met many of the players now called into the ParaMatildas team, as well as the all-woman coaching staff who will accompany her to Spain. She believes creating programs and pathways for athletes with disability at the grassroots and community level is crucial for the Australian game to grow, particularly off the back of next year's Women's World Cup on home soil. ""Pathways is the future of football. We wouldn't have any of this without those programs. Continuing to build those is really important,"" she said. ""As a country, we need to be open to change, open to inclusiveness. We're starting to do that now. I think we're gonna see all sorts of football develop in different forms like powerchair, CP football, let's bring frame football in, let's bring in blind football. ""Because football is football, you know? It shouldn't be based on gender or age or ability. It's a game that brings everyone together. ""For young athletes out there who may be in different sports but have a passion for football, yet they haven't had the chance or didn't know there was a pathway, they can now see these two teams at a CP World Cup. That's so exciting for our game."" With their eyes now turned firmly to Spain, Stirton said the team's biggest success would not necessarily be the numbers on the scoreboard. ""I think our first World Cup is all about overcoming our challenges, overcoming our fears, overcoming our anxieties of what we can achieve. ""I just want to see these girls on the pitch, enjoying their football. This is a sport that we need to enjoy; there are so many bad things happening in the world at the moment, let's try and look at the good things. ""It's all about overcoming the barriers that these athletes have had for many, many years. To be able to step onto that field with the Australian badge on is just the start. ""Results should matter in a World Cup, but being the first one for these girls, taking the pressure off them and letting them enjoy it is the main thing."" For Anderson, while she shares the drive of her teammates to come home with a medal, she knows that — just like that 1988 FIFA tournament — the biggest success will be felt long after the first one is over. Herstory, after all, starts small. It starts with pioneers like them. ""I know the girls want to do well so badly, but we haven't seen ourselves in World Cups yet. We haven't even played as a team yet,"" she said, laughing. ""Results aside, I just want these girls to get a taste of what it's like to compete at this level and what it means when you come home: the feeling of that, and how much it shapes you moving forward in your life, whether that's in sport or work or family. ""I'm already so proud. Proud of these girls and proud of everyone who's got us here. Being able to back this up after Beijing is a dream for me, but to do it with this group is something I'll never forget. ""I hope that we can be for other girls what so many athletes with disability have been for us."" You can watch all the ParaMatildas games live and free on the MyFootball Youtube Channel.

18,"Adam's parents thought he was Footscray's water boy, but their shy little boy had entered 'perpetual hell'",sport," Sport Adam Kneale was like any footy-loving boy of the 80s until a trip to Footscray’s Western Oval turned his innocent life into a nightmare For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency For reasons that become obvious once he starts talking about his life, Adam Kneale is one of those people whose many personal qualities are hidden to all but the handful of people who know him well. WARNING: This story contains graphic descriptions of sexual abuse. Deeply caring, principled, well read and articulate, at 49, he speaks in a husky growl developed in his decades barking orders across dusty warehouses. When you listen to the things he says and the way they're phrased, you're struck by the feeling that Adam's voice is not quite his own. Loved ones accept he is almost incapable of displaying his warmth. Adam has difficulty giving and receiving presents, or even saying 'I love you'. His mother, Lyn, says it's because one of the many things that was taken from him as a boy was his ability to experience joy. Stoic above all else, Adam has never told Lyn the story of how he came to be the way he is, but she knows it. Twenty-nine years ago, sweating and overcome with nausea, she read it in an eight-page police statement that broke her heart and shattered an illusion she'd treasured — that the bubble of love she created around her family was impenetrable. ""I didn't want the explanations after that,"" Lyn says. ""I knew he'd been violated, abused, hurt, damaged for life."" Two years ago, mired in a deep personal crisis, Adam was deemed medically incapable of working. Thus ended his successful career as a commercial window-maker. A determined provider above all else, he'd spent the previous 20 years expanding his skills, extending his resume, moving further up the ladder. In his 40s, management roles stretched him too far. Only with hindsight can Adam see that the endless sprint of his work life was a vain attempt to outrun his past. Natasha, Adam's wife, explains a typical day in his final working years: at 5am, she'd wake to the familiar sound and shallow jolts to the mattress that accompanied Adam's tears. She could comfort him then. She could console him when he returned home in the same state. But not in the hours between. His second breakdown of the morning would occur before he'd even clocked on. At work, Adam was constantly frustrated, his temper boiling over at the slightest infractions of company rules. When anxiety set in, his trembling arms and legs failed him. He'd lose control of his emotions, sobbing behind his work bench, forgetting how to do a job he'd been doing for 20 years. Instead of sympathising, colleagues preyed on his emotional volatility, hiding his tools and laughing at the inevitable eruptions. There were silent battles too. If anyone watched Adam as he worked, simple tasks became insurmountable. Yet, his employers did and said almost nothing to help. ""There was a lack of empathy,"" Adam says, a great understatement. As survivors continue to come forward to tell their stories, it is surely time that major sporting institutions perform their own, unsparing investigations into historical child sexual abuse, writes Russell Jackson. In August of 2020, ""everything collapsed"". Doctors and psychologists finally stepped in, telling Adam the complex side effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were overwhelming him. His Centrelink assessment was somehow even more demoralising than the daily indignities of work. ""It was like I had to prove what happened to me,"" he says. ""And then they wouldn't let me go on it based on my mental health. It was only the fact that 20 years lifting giant plates of glass had caused injuries that required spinal surgery that got me on it."" Now, his trembling hands and legs are the by-product of an ""astronomical"" dosage of antidepressants and the debilitating anxiety that prevents him from making basic human connections. Recently, a green-thumb neighbour arrived at the door with some fruit and vegetables. Adam wanted to say hello, introduce himself and thank the man for his generosity. His mouth even shaped to deliver the words. But none came out. ""Everything just scrambled,"" he says, recalling the embarrassment and private sorrow. It made him think of what another doctor once told him: ""He said 'You need to let this go'. I said, 'Let go? It has a hold of me'."" Perhaps it is just Adam's calm, even-handed retelling of the horrifying stories of his life that throws such people, convincing them he is doing fine. For Adam, each such moment is just the latest in a series of brutal conclusions formed by people who don't know him — confirmation that what happened to him doesn't matter anymore, that maybe his life never meant anything at all. There is a handwritten note from a classmate on the back of Adam Kneale's final high school annual that explains what he was like as a schoolboy: ""Best of luck in the future and don't be so shy."" That was the way Adam had been from day one — the youngest and smallest kid in his grade, the quietest, the most introverted, painfully shy. In his prep class photo, impossibly tiny, he hides his face behind his hands. In 1972, Lyn was only a teenager when she had him, Adam's father Chas not much older. Raised in England, not long relocated to Australia and married in a rush, Lyn was undaunted. ""I just melted,"" she says of her first glimpse of Adam. As he progressed from placid baby to timid primary schooler, the two things that mattered most to Adam were common obsessions for boys of the late 1970s: music and footy. The first was fait accompli. In utero, Adam felt the vibrations of Led Zeppelin's infamous Kooyong gig. In working-class Williamstown, the family lived above a record shop. In the backyard, musician Chas ran a recording studio graced by Daddy Cool, The Models and a procession of intriguing characters. Lyn has a photo album for every year of Adam's life. In the toddler era, guitars, amplifiers and records are the cherubic blond's constant companions. Four years later, his little brother arrives. Chas buys them Essendon footy jumpers and they join him in abandoning the family tradition: grandfather Charlie Kneale was Footscray to the bone, a Doggies stalwart for life. Adam can't remember exactly how it came about, but Footscray and Fitzroy legend Bernie Quinlan taught him how to kick a torpedo. He has clearer memories of learning the ropes as a guitarist: Daddy Cool's Ross Hannaford showed him how to play Eagle Rock. Those two crucial strands of Adam's life are glimpsed in a black and white photo from the late 1970s. With Chas's studio behind him, Adam leans back and launches his footy into the air — a dreamy image of carefree times. In it, Lyn can now see the boy she was soon to lose. Williamstown had given her sons memories they still cherish, but by the beginning of 1984 — the year Adam would turn 12 — Lyn's career as a computer programmer was taking off and she didn't think it was safe or responsible to keep renting a drop-in centre for vagabond artists. That was how and why the Kneale's ended up in Chas's home town of West Footscray — safety, the security of affordable home ownership and the promise of a grown-up life in a quieter, more traditionally suburban setting. Or so they thought. Adam fixated on the most obvious attraction of his new neighbourhood: it was a footy town and league football matches were now walking distance from home. As the family settled into its new surroundings in early 1984, 11-year-old Adam quickly found a new identity at the nearby Western Oval, then the home of the VFL's Footscray Football Club, now the Whitten Oval, home of the AFL and AFLW's Western Bulldogs. If footy ran second to music among Kneale family preoccupations, it was a close race. ""Football was big in our family,"" Adam says. ""Footscray was everything with my grandfather. Ted Whitten lived near them. He'd tell me about Ted giving his wife flowers before he headed to the footy."" For Lyn, it seemed a wholesome place for a boy to spend Saturday afternoons. For Chas, born and raised in the area, a few beers behind the goals was the perfect way of catching up with mates. ""We were Essendon supporters, but in a sense we were football supporters,"" Adam says. ""The Western Oval was the local ground, so you went there to watch the game. We went to see Simon Beasley and Doug Hawkins and all those fantastic players."" Armed with Quinlan's torpedo tips, Adam could kick as well as any boy in the area, but in other crucial facets of playing the game he struggled, rarely venturing too far from the bench in stints with local junior teams Yarraville and West Footscray. ""He was the last picked, and I could see that happening,"" Lyn says. Wary that Adam was also being bullied at school, fearful he'd lose the social capital offered by sport, she enrolled him in Judo classes to build his self-esteem. Therefore, Lyn was relieved when Adam returned home one afternoon and said he'd been offered a job as water boy at the Footscray Football Club. ""I thought that's great — he loves footy, his dad loved Footscray as his second team, and it was an after-school activity that didn't conflict with Judo,"" she says. Only now do the problems stand out: Lyn and Chas knew nothing of the person who'd offered Adam the role, nor that the job, as Adam stated, did not even exist. It would be a decade before they found out the real reason their son spent so many days and evenings at the Western Oval. And they would never so much as glimpse the man whose crimes have plagued their son's life. Back then, Adam knew him only as 'Chops', a grubby-looking, pot-bellied 40-something wearing a thick blue raincoat that smelled of cigarettes. Adam quickly established that he worked for the Bulldogs — doing what, he wasn't sure, but Chops always carried around vast sums of cash, had unhindered access to all areas of the club's offices, including the safe, and everybody at Footscray seemed to know his name. It was at the urging of a schoolmate with whom Adam had been wagging school that he first met Chops. ""My mate recruited me,"" Adam says. ""That's the only way I can put it."" One game-day in April of 1984, the boy told Adam that if he slipped away from his father's side, walked to the other end of the ground and saw 'Chops' standing at the top of a staircase to the Western Oval's John Gent Stand, he could wander up and be granted a few precious commodities: money to buy lunch, as many tickets to the footy as he wanted, and maybe season passes too. They were promises too enticing for an 11-year-old boy to ignore. On January 28, 1993, in a gruesome, 5500-word written statement to police at North Altona — the document whose contents he has never discussed with his mother — Adam began his story with the sort of understatement that remains his hallmark: ""From the time I was 12 years old I had a problem with a man who I had met in Footscray."" It outlined the next stages plainly. 'Chops' had indeed given Adam as many tickets to the footy as he wanted, just as the other boy had promised. There was money as well — Adam had never held a $10 or $20 note before, but Chops was soon handing them over in endless instalments. There was a certain prestige, too. Wandering through the inner sanctum with a Footscray insider, a timid, starry-eyed little boy in a new and unfamiliar neighbourhood suddenly felt a part of big-time footy. But there were obvious questions Adam never said out loud: why was Chops so keen to get him inside the Bulldogs clubrooms while the game was on? And why did the man never seem interested in watching the game? In his early journeys through Footscray's inner sanctum, Adam thought he would receive a brand new Sherrin football. Instead, Chops wedged him behind a cupboard door that blocked the view of anyone who might approach and began sexually molesting him. That routine was repeated at several home games early in 1984 and for years after — assaults that would last as long as the man felt he could get away with it. In Round 10 of 1984, for instance, as Bulldogs hero Beasley intercepted Graeme Allen's infamously errant pass out of defence and sunk Collingwood with the final kick of the day, Adam spent a portion of his 12th birthday being sexually abused. But that, he would soon learn, was merely the grooming phase. The worst of it began as June wore on. Apparently undetected as he repeatedly walked Adam through the Footscray offices and social club on game days, Chops became bolder and more depraved. The 'first time' is still burned into Adam's mind: the sight of Chops carrying bags of money to the Bulldogs safe; their winding journey around the club before Chops guided him into the toilets beside a function room, locking the door behind them; the sudden exposure Adam felt as he was pushed towards the sink and stripped of his pants; the mirrored reflection of Chops casually retrieving a tube of lubricant from his pocket; the ensuing sodomy, in which, Adam later told police, his assailant ""just kept forcing it in"". In the corresponding section of Adam's police statement, what chills most is the dispassionate, unadorned sentence that explains what happened in the moments after he was raped for the first time at the Footscray football club: ""Chops gave me about $10 and I went outside to watch the football."" By the closing stages of the 1984 VFL season, Footscray in its first campaign under Mick Malthouse was headed for the same result as a year earlier — seventh place, just out of finals contention. But unlike previous seasons, good times seemed near. In the preceding months, Adam had become a fixture at the club, but not as his parents envisaged. His 'water boy' duties were to turn up at the Western Oval training sessions of the club's Under-19s — the team Chops seemed most heavily invested in — and be sexually assaulted in any free room his abuser could find. On game days, the pattern of Adam's weekends for years ahead took shape: up the steps of the John Gent Stand, money in his hand and a trip behind closed doors, where he'd be manoeuvred around like a rag doll, responding to endless sexual demands. He recalls fixing his gaze on a decommissioned pie warmer as he was assaulted in semi-darkness. Another time it happened behind a bar. ""If he could only get oral satisfaction from me, that's what he'd put up with,"" Adam says. ""He could almost hover around anywhere and do that, especially when the game was on — before half-time or after half-time."" Only with the benefit of hindsight can Adam see the traits that made him such easy prey — the insecurity and defencelessness he projected as a small, shy boy in an unfamiliar place, his lack of friends, the general sense he was isolated and adrift in the world. His abuser wheedled out other telling details: Adam's eagerness for money, his truancy from a tough new school, news that Lyn and Chas's marriage was faltering, that by 1986 Chas had moved out, and soon, amid the worst of his abuse, Adam's enthusiasm for drugs that helped him disassociate. ""I was the example of what they look for,"" Adam says. ""I was the blueprint."" The final round of the 1984 season was a magical Saturday afternoon for most young footy fans: Adam's hero Terry Daniher, whose number five adorned his Bombers guernsey, kicked four out of 27 goals, setting the club's premiership September in motion; at the Junction Oval, Quinlan kicked his 100th goal of the season to clinch Fitzroy's finals spot; Leigh Matthews and Warwick Capper kicked bags for their respective teams. All of it was shown that night on the Seven network's two-hour 'Big League' highlights show, known among fans in those days as 'the replay'. Footscray was away in the hostile territory of Collingwood's Victoria Park that day, so Adam didn't attend. But Chops assured him they could grab some dinner and watch the replay together. That night — the evening of September 1, 1984 — Adam stepped into a taxi with a man whose name he didn't know and headed for Footscray's Palms Motel, a low budget motor inn whose modernist facade did not disguise its dingy atmosphere and seedy clientele. Escorted into a second-floor room, Melbourne's County Court later heard, Adam was fed by his companion and watched TV — the replay started with a half-hour recap of the Bulldogs's 43-point loss to the Pies. It was probably as Peter Landy read the final rites of Footscray's season that Adam was ordered towards the room's shower, told to strip off his clothes and bathe with his abuser. Who knows whether the TV was still on when they reached the bed, where Chops pushed Adam onto his stomach and commenced the sodomy that ""hurt like fury"". And what on earth could have been going on in Adam's head as the crime reached its conclusion, leading him to remark in his statement: ""I'm not sure if he stopped because he had ejaculated or because he was hurting me."" Only years later did Adam realise this was simply ""the next phase"". He was being conditioned to abuse outside the Footscray Football Club. Chops was ensuring he wouldn't lose Adam over the summer, when there were fewer plausible reasons for a 40-something man to meet a 12-year-old boy at the Western Oval. On the rare occasions he's felt compelled to tell his story since — to police, to employers who required an explanation for his mood swings, now to the world — Adam has always flinched at the prospect of the listener's incredulity. He understands the obvious question: why would you turn up and subject yourself to such horrors? He sees now that he'd developed an ""unhealthy"" relationship with money, but it was not about the cash. More compelling was the confusing mixture of guilt, trauma and shame, and the fear he held of being ""found out"" and exposed. Like so many victims of childhood abuse, Adam had been convinced by his abuser that only he was at fault, a dilemma that silenced him. He also recalls what he refers to as ""the freeze"" — he can still feel it, but he can't quite explain it. ""You know what's going on, but you just freeze in that moment,"" he says. ""You're in a trap, but you ignore it. I have an adult mind now. But that young kid's mind — how did it work? I can't relate to that now. It's gone."" It remains his greatest barrier to feeling believed: ""Everyone thinks with their adult rationality,” he says. “That doesn't work."" It was not until May of 1994, his nerves shredded as he sat in court, that Adam confirmed the identity of the man who destroyed his life. Graeme Barry Hobbs was indeed 40-something when Adam first approached him for footy tickets and lunch money, and was indeed heavily involved in fundraising activities at the Footscray Football Club. Hobbs had also been a senior technical officer with the Defence Department in Maribyrnong, testing ammunition and explosives for the Navy. Among the more pathetic details to emerge in court was that for his entire campaign of abuse against Adam, Hobbs was still living with his parents in his childhood home in Maidstone, also conveniently close to the Western Oval. Upon his death, aged 63 in 2009, Hobbs was recalled fondly in a short newspaper tribute, described by family as a loving brother and son. Fifteen years earlier, on the front page of The Western Times, a local newspaperman described him in a far less flattering light, as a child abuser who ""used his position at the Footscray Football Club to lure a young boy into a web of sex"". The article went on: ""The court was told that Hobbs was a single man whose passion through life had been the Footscray Football Club. He had been involved in various positions at the club, including that of chairman of fundraising."" ""When police raided his home on February 9, 1993, they discovered 39 Footscray Football Club membership cards and 14 Footscray Football Club membership medallions. Prosecutor Ms Francine McNiff said the Crown would suggest that these items were used by Hobbs to cultivate boys."" The emphasis there was on the plural — 'boys'. Although the prosecution case was built on the stories of two victims, police had gathered evidence confirming Hobbs had abused many more boys. The court did not consider another obvious possibility — backed by Adam's account of Hobbs's regular journeys to and from the club safe and his gifting to Adam of hessian money bags and an unbroken cardboard roll of coins meant for the cash float — that at a time when Footscray's finances were flatlining, Hobbs was embezzling the money he was giving Adam and other victims. It was also not for the court to ponder how such an unseemly character had avoided the detection of Footscray's administrative and management staff, because Hobbs's roles at Footscray went beyond just fundraising activities, for which he is acknowledged several times in club annual reports of the 1980s. He was also a stalwart of the club's Under-19s program, credited in annual reports as late as 1991 as the team's ""room steward"". According to Adam, Hobbs was more accurately described in the 1987 and 1988 reports, which listed him as Footscray's ""Jack of all trades"". In his police statement, Adam was unequivocal on Hobbs's status at Footscray: ""He was very popular because whoever you spoke to knew who he was."" Now, Adam and his family can't understand how nobody sensed something amiss. ""Because of all of the meetings we had during the week, whether it was on Monday or Wednesday, or senior training nights as well, we'd be out the front of the main entrance to the office, with the big bulldog on the roof,"" Adam says. ""There was an audacity to it. He'd walk me through the offices. He introduced me to the secretary. It was completely open. It was just blatant. It was like there were no consequences. ""The players were walking in and out, saying hi to him. Other people from within the club, in suits and dresses, would all say hello. People were walking in and out of the club, seeing this old guy chatting to a young boy. It would have looked a bit suspicious, you would think. ""I know there were a couple of times where he nearly got caught."" And how could it go on for so long? All told, Adam says, Hobbs raped and abused him on Footscray's premises for seven years, from 1984 to 1990. He can think of only one way of contextualising it: ""It went on longer than some of the players' careers."" Already, you might be at the point that most people reach when confronted with a story like Adam's. You probably don't want to read another word. Like many survivors, Adam can intuit this moment's arrival — when people switch off and can't stand any more. An indignity common to survivors is to feel a drain on those around them. 'How much more can this person take?' they silently ask themselves. Telling strangers comes with different burdens — not just the risk of feeling society's cold shoulder, but the likelihood of stirring up the cliches about sexual abuse that are embedded in popular culture. Like 'how could the victim of such monsters not become a monster himself?' When Adam first told his story in full, in his police statement, those anxieties and others played heavily on his mind. The result is obvious to him now: he made a partial disclosure, offering only representative examples of his abuse, skipping giant chunks of his story, couching his horrific and abnormal experiences in terms that made it easier for the person on the other side of the table. ""It took 12 hours and I was shutting off,"" he says. ""To take the pressure off myself, I made it sound like there were periods of time where nothing happened. And that's rubbish. That is just the humiliation and the shame of going through that with a stranger who I'd only met a few hours before."" In fact, he scrapped almost half his story. Not long removed from the homophobic barbs of his schoolyard, Adam ended the statement in 1987, when he'd turned 15. It meant he could avoid explaining how he was still being abused three years later, in early adulthood. Sadly, certain interactions of the ensuing years have vindicated his decision. People have read his statement and not believed that one person could endure so many assaults. What might they have said if he'd included the stomach-turning rest? Consider 1985 and 1986 alone. They did indeed prove to be highlight-filled times for Bulldogs fans. The club was two kicks away from the grand final in '85. In his first season with Footscray, Brad Hardie won the Brownlow, and Beasley the Coleman, with a cherished century of goals. They were not such fun times for Adam. Having drugged, degraded and paid the boy for his silence, Hobbs began offering him around to his ""friends"" — the paedophile ring who would make Adam's life a living hell for years to come. There was 'Steve', who abused Adam in a grimy hotel somewhere in the western suburbs, with Hobbs first observing and then joining in, sodomising Adam as Steve put his clothes back on, left the room without looking back and drove away in a white Kingswood. His abusers had told him ""everything would be alright"". Adam feared otherwise. ""I didn't want to get hurt by them,"" he told police. There was the unnamed 60-something in a house in Flemington, at which Hobbs tranquillised Adam with Rohypnol, dressed him in women's underwear and photographed him — child pornography later seized in a raid of Hobbs's parents' house, but not before it had spread through the abuse network. There was 'Noel', another 40-something who would sit around watching football until Hobbs ferried Adam to the house in Moonee Ponds where, periodically between 1986 and 1988, both men would repeatedly subject the teenager to painful penetrations. Of that, Adam told police: ""Noel was very rough with me. He knew it hurt but it didn't worry him, he just kept going."" Adam recalls his sheer hopelessness, his feeling of being ""frightened shitless"". ""But there was a resignation that it was going to happen and that I couldn't avoid it any longer,"" he says. And it was grimly repetitive. If Footscray were playing at home, Hobbs would abuse him at the Western Oval or occasionally the Palms Motel, under increasingly heavy sedation. On 'away' game weekends, he was taken to Noel's house, where anything could happen. An example was Round 10 of the 1988 season. On Saturday afternoon, reigning premiers Carlton defeated Footscray by 21 points at the Western Oval. On Sunday, as another game played on TV, Adam spent his 16th birthday being abused by Noel's girlfriend. About Noel, Hobbs had the temerity to moralise, telling Adam he was a ""dangerous"" man who would one day be caught, because he was ""not very nice"" and ""preferred younger people that were under 10 years of age"". In reality, both men were prolific and indiscriminate abusers, forever in debt to each other. ""There was this circle of handing boys around to other people,"" Adam says. ""One would get a boy, and he'd be shared throughout the group."" For Adam, that is where the faces and degradations start blurring together. ""There were a lot of [abusers] who I just didn't know who they were,"" he says. ""I'd be told 'this person is a good person'. I'd be taken into a hotel room and have to show on Hobbs what I could do for them. And then it was their turn. ""Sometimes I'd be taken to a house and there would be a gathering and they'd all bring their best boy, and it was just a swap meet."" Scariest of all was when Hobbs applied pressure to set up a meeting with Adam's younger brother. That danger was reinforced when Hobbs showed up at the Kneale household and abused Adam in his bedroom, until then one of the few unsullied spaces in his life. ""I was afraid for my brother,"" Adam says. ""I always protected him. I just couldn't have handled it. And it was a secret. I had to hide it from everyone."" In recent weeks, ABC Sport approached the owner of the house in Moonee Ponds, who confirmed that he sub-leased part of the property to 'Noel' at the time of Adam's abuse. ""Noel was a good man,"" he claimed. ""Sometimes he went to church with me."" Victoria Police's Delta task force is a mostly forgotten story of Melbourne policing history. Operating between 1982 and 1985, its groundbreaking attempt to police child exploitation was scrapped soon after its highest profile case was thrown out of court. Among Delta's documentary relics presented during the Royal Commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, there is a list drawn up by Neil Comrie, then Delta's leader, later Victoria's Commissioner of Police. Under the subject line ""Trends in sexual offences against children"", Comrie collated the key attributes to identify victims of abuse. The 12-point list remains a useful resource for parents. With the benefit of hindsight, it also serves as a biography of Adam Kneale in the 1980s: Of course, Adam was in the age bracket. He was often unsupervised, too. By 1986, a long time coming, Chas and Lyn's divorce was formalised. The Kneale boys became ""latchkey kids"" whose high-achieving mother worked two jobs to keep them fed, clothed and happy. Moods? Lyn recalls her strong sense in the ensuing years of ""losing my little boy"" — Adam's inexplicable aggression, the banging of pots and pans, his constant scheming and lying, the calls about his absences from school. ""That's when I was probably the angriest with him, just saying 'tell me what's going on',"" Lyn says. ""Why are you so glum? Where have you been? What have you been doing? He'd say 'just at the football club'. He couldn't describe why he was angry. Or he wouldn't. ""He was irrational. You could see he was frustrated. But I couldn't draw it out from him."" Morals? In the grip of Hobbs's manipulation and abuse, Adam's were entirely warped. Seeking attention? Hobbs, Adam says, ""had a sixth sense for kids who were desperate for attention"" and picked his mark perfectly. Rewards and approval? Adam became obsessed with money — getting it from Hobbs and spending it. Thus a childhood album overflowing with ticket stubs from expensive rock concerts — Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon's Graceland tour. Thus the fancy presents Adam lavished on loved ones at birthday, Easter and Christmas times. School? Tottenham Tech was a decrepit wasteland, violent and unruly, plagued by staffing shortages and soon to be shuttered. A mute, often absent student like Adam was unlikely to command any attention at all, let alone raise alarm bells. And it is hard to believe the school would have saved Adam had it known. The year his abuse began, a recently-hired Tottenham Tech teacher prompted a media firestorm by pledging public support for an organisation called The Australian Paedophile Support Group, among whose aims was to lower the age of consent to 10. It was the unsuccessful charges that stemmed from a raid on one of its meetings that torpedoed the Delta Task Force. Recreation centres? Inordinate time in the company of adults? The Western Oval was Adam's second home, Hobbs his constant companion, Adam's peers were not even invited around for his birthdays. Withdrawn from family? Without even seeing the list, Lyn offers a summary of Adam's mid-teens: ""He was withdrawing from the family circle."" Her mother's intuition suggested Adam was wrestling with his sexuality. ""Of course, he said, 'I wouldn't know what you're talking about, Mum'. I said 'Please talk to me. Tell me what's going on.' We talked about bullying and grooming. Adam was blankfaced and said, 'No, no way, nothing like that is happening.' And it was,"" she says. An example of the parallel realities of mother and son was Adam's trip to Sydney in 1987, to watch the Bulldogs playing against the Swans. ""I remember him phoning me up and saying, 'Mum, would you let me go on a trip to Sydney with the Footscray Football Club?',"" Lyn says. ""I said 'who is organising it? Who is in charge? How long is it for?' ""A guy was put on the phone. I don't know what name he gave me, but he said it was for the young kids who'd been helping out as well as the young players, and they were going up there in a bus. He said it'd be a fun experience for him to see an interstate game. 'We'll take good care of him.' I thought that meant they'd make sure he didn't get drunk. ""But little did I know what was going on."" The man, of course, was Graeme Hobbs. For much of the ride to Sydney, in a bus chartered for the Bulldogs party, he placed his grubby blue jacket over their laps and molested Adam, handing him $100 on arrival and instructions on when to meet at a hotel room. Spooked by the sum — more than he'd ever received in one hit — Adam listened to his instincts and walked the streets of King's Cross all night instead. On game day, the Bulldogs were thumped by 108 points. But Hobbs's wandering hands were small fry in Adam's list of problems by that point. The secret he was keeping from his family was very far from the quiet suburban adolescence his parents wanted for him. By 1987, his life was barely distinguishable from that of a child sex slave. Only years latter could Adam fully appreciate that the most dangerous person he encountered amid the degradations and terror of his childhood was not Graeme Hobbs, but a man he only knew as 'John'. Adam's ""far too many"" meetings with John took place at a one-bedroom apartment in Essendon. Hobbs told Adam it was John's home, but it was so devoid of furnishings and signs of habitation that the teenager immediately suspected it was more likely the clubhouse of the paedophile ring that had claimed him. For one thing, Hobbs had a key, a courtesy not extended by 'Noel'. For another, Adam later found out, the house John shared with his wife and children was in nearby Glenroy. It explained why he was always in a hurry to leave. His name really was John, it turned out — John Raymond Wayland. In 1996, Justice Higgins of Melbourne's County Court jailed the 53-year-old for 16 years, describing his depraved sex offending as the worst case of child abuse he'd encountered in any court. Wayland used his contacts in junior sporting clubs and the proximity of his house to a local school to abuse children during their lunch breaks — opportunistic and sickening attacks that included penetration with cutlery, vegetables and sauce bottles, and orders for the children to perform sex acts on each other. After life-altering ordeals that left them with lacerations and internal injuries, the children were told by Wayland that if they spoke of their abuse, they would end up in jail. That Wayland didn't receive a far longer sentence of his own was only down to the fact that ""unlawful indecent assault"" — sexual acts not including penetration — was the only charge available at the time. Thus, not one of Wayland's many brutal acts of penetration could be charged, the court heard, ""because of the existence of time limits which require proceedings to be instituted within 12 months of the commission of the offences"". Newspaper reports carried prosecutor Frank Gucciardo's descriptions of Wayland as ""the ringleader of a group of men who sexually abused young boys and girls"", part of a ""larger systematic pattern of criminality"". Adam could certainly attest to that, too. In one visit to Wayland's apartment, he says he was abused by four men at once, a memory he finds almost impossible to verbalise. Another time, Wayland raped him for 10 minutes as Hobbs ate Kentucky Fried Chicken in the next room. Telling the latter story to police, Adam signed off with another of his plain-spoken, heartbreaking laments: ""I never wanted to have sex with any of these people."" These days, Wayland — once described as ""so likely to commit further sexual offences that you constitute a danger to the community"" — lives in north-western Victoria, within walking distance of four schools. Approached for comment by ABC Sport, Wayland said he has served his time and reformed his character. He claimed no memory of Adam Kneale. Asked to explain his association with Graeme Hobbs, Wayland claimed to have met Hobbs only twice. The second time, Wayland said, was at Pentridge, where both men were incarcerated. The first was when Wayland was briefly a trainer at a football club in which Hobbs was also involved — the Footscray Football Club. Adam now sees his life as a series of seven-year cycles. The first was the period of his abuse. Before the next commenced, aged only 20, he somehow found the courage to report his abusers. He'd been unravelling for three months, since the day of his daughter's birth. The arrival of a first child is daunting for any parent. For Adam it was almost lethal. In photos, he now sees himself having ""the nervous breakdown that I didn't recover from"". The other trigger occurred a year earlier. At 19, Adam assumed he was too old for his abuser, but Hobbs resumed contact with an equally sinister purpose. He wanted Adam to join his circle of offenders. ""You just have that feeling that if you don't want it to happen again, you've got to do something about it,"" Adam says. Little wonder workplace car parks became the scene of future breakdowns. Adam's first — the worst — occurred on the morning of January 28, 1993. Overwhelmed by tears, he found a phone and called police. ""I started the statement at three o'clock in the afternoon and I was still there at three in the morning,"" he says. ""It was an out-of-body experience. I look back on that time and think: How did I move? How did I function? How did I get through it?"" In truth, his coping mechanisms were unhealthy. Most survivors realise only with hindsight how susceptible they were to the worst-case outcomes of childhood sexual abuse — mental illness, drug and alcohol addiction, violence, crime, suicide. To his lifelong regret, from the age of 16 and until his report to police, with both the mother of his daughter and in a previous relationship, Adam's anger became violence. ""I just turned into the person I was afraid of — people who'd pick on the weakest or quietest person,"" he says. ""You're lashing out at someone else for something else. I'll probably never get over that, just as they won't. I understand why it happened, but it doesn't take away from the fact that it did, and I still have to live with that."" Fearful of hurting anyone else, feeling unworthy of love, he would stay single for a decade. Eleven days after Adam's statement, Hobbs was arrested and charged. Another survivor came forward. Hobbs confessed, but his sentencing hinged mostly on Adam's evidence. Other burdens swamped Adam. Police pointed out the obvious: none of the men who'd abused him wore condoms, so he'd need to commence AIDS testing, checking in every six months. ""It was horrific,"" he says of the lonely nights he spent pondering his fate. ""But it was piled onto the horrific things I was already dealing with — the court case, the therapy, the doctors, the first raids of early computers with child pornography. It was all one big mass of trouble at the time."" He doesn't recall turning 21. Not wanting to pry, friends and family assumed he was part of a class action, not the linchpin of the case. A lawyer's promise of free psychiatric care for life evaporated. Inevitably, the court process was a crushing disappointment too, so Adam chose to delude himself. For years afterwards, he clung to a lie that Hobbs had faced 99 charges and been imprisoned for 13 years, the full force of the justice system coming down on him. The reality was far less emphatic: 13 counts of indecent assault, two of unlawful possession of Footscray Football Club tickets and medallions, one of buggery, one of possessing child pornography. As would occur in Wayland's case, acts of penetration committed more than 12 months before the investigation sat outside the statute of limitations, and Hobbs's early admission of guilt meant a large cache of photographs he had taken of his many victims was not presented in court. His 39-month sentence for destroying Adam's life came with a minimum of just 15 months. Two years later, Adam clipped a newspaper story of John Wayland's conviction and sighed relief, but having directed investigators to numerous hotels and the house in Moonee Ponds, he never found out if 'Noel' or others had faced justice. In 1989, when Hobbs was still abusing and paying off Adam on the Footscray Football Club's premises, the Bulldogs had only survived extinction thanks to the Fightback campaign, led by famed Melbourne lawyer Peter Gordon, who in the process rose to the club's presidency. Adam's fightback campaign was longer and far more arduous — another seven-year cycle that stretched from Hobbs's sentencing in May of 1994 until 2000. In this phase, his paltry victims-of-crime compensation payout did not last long. With 50 per cent custody of his daughter, he needed to pull himself together while living on medical benefits and charity, balancing his own psychiatric care with the needs of his child. How did he pull himself back from the brink? At a time when male survivors of sexual abuse were actively excluded from support services with feminist foundations, he located what seemed the only male-run one — the Against Male Assault Network — and threw himself into their programs, completing certificate qualifications to help other survivors. He thought music could heal him too, so put a band together. A few frazzled, knock-kneed performances later, ""frightened shitless"", he realised his childhood dream was over, right as his brother found a niche in Melbourne's indie music scene. ""We were a very musical family,"" Adam says. ""I should have been able to do something with it, but trauma just destroyed it."" Parenting became his number one priority. ""My daughter was my anchor,"" he says. ""She inspired me. I wanted to be an example for her, that you've got to stand up and fight for yourself."" But even that presented problems. Adam now rues how much trauma she was exposed to as he tried to find help. As 2000 progressed, two decisions — one his own, one someone else's — would shape the next 20 years of Adam's life. The first was out of his hands. Summoned to a Centrelink office, he was assessed as capable of returning to full-time work. Part of him genuinely accepted it — he wanted to be a role model and felt increasingly judged when loved ones mentioned his longstanding welfare dependency. But a few years removed from the 20-year treadmill he stepped onto, Adam now sees what he could not at the time. ""I was never fit for work,"" he says. ""There is no way in hell they would do that now."" The other big decision was his own. After seven years of intensive treatment, he felt he'd ""graduated"" from the program of therapy that had been a major personal focus. ""I came to an agreement with my psychologist that my time was done, but they didn't know what I had,"" he says. ""There was a long list — anxiety, depression, agoraphobia, it went on. All those things are now under four letters — PTSD. I've had it since I was a teenager."" Among the more puzzling outcomes of Graeme Hobbs's conviction for Adam's abuse, a pair of non-events particularly stand out. The first was the averted gaze of the media when the horrifying scale of Hobbs's offending became a series of reportable facts. In a city where football is religion, at a time when child sexual abuse had been removed from the too-hard basket and given front-page prominence by well-resourced major newspapers, Adam's story was almost nowhere to be seen. Just how was it, he now wonders, that a parochial suburban paper like The Western Times — edited then by a Footscray football club board member, no less — was the only media outlet to report on an AFL club playing host to such a stupefying case of child abuse? The second was Footscray Football Club's failure to publicly acknowledge Adam's story — no statement, no expression of regret, not so much as a notation in its annual report. There was no private apology, either. For Adam, that was and remains particularly galling. The club's president at the time was Peter Gordon, a cousin of Adam's father Chas. ""The Kneales and the Gordons all used to live within a block in West Footscray,"" Adam says. ""To see people like Peter Gordon and to think that … I couldn't stand the club. I couldn't stand to go past the place. Even now, I wouldn't even venture into the western suburbs. There is just too much disappointment associated with that club. To me, now, it is just a cesspit."" He was gladder than anyone when the club changed its name to the Western Bulldogs, because ""any mention of Footscray was just a trigger-and-a-half"". In a written response to questions from ABC Sport, Peter Gordon said he had no recollection of Adam's story and ""no knowledge of any interaction the club may have had with Adam nor any offer of assistance"". ""Until this week, I was unaware my cousin Charles Kneale had a son named Adam, and I have no recollection of hearing of Adam or what you have described,"" Gordon wrote. ""I also know nothing of Graeme Hobbs or the nature of his relationship with the club. But I'm glad he was charged and convicted and I hope he got a fitting sentence."" Gordon said the Kneale and Gordon families had been estranged for as long as he could remember, but that he had ""a vague recollection of Charles writing a letter addressed to me care of the club during the October 1989 fightback campaign with a cassette of a song he had recorded about the club that he thought we could publish to make money"". ""But I have no other memory of that family,"" he wrote. Gordon added that for most of 1993, 1994 and 1995, he was in Western Australia taking statements and initiating litigation on behalf of 320 men who'd been abused in Christian Brothers institutions, so had ""some idea of the profound and lifelong trauma such abuse inflicts"". Dennis Galimberti, who was Footscray's chief executive for a decade between late 1986 and late 1996, told ABC Sport the club was unaware of Adam's abuse at the time it occurred. ""It may have been on the front page of the Western Times, which I've got no recollection of whatsoever, but we didn't know these offences had occurred at the club,"" Galimberti says. Galimberti recalls seeing Hobbs around at the club but said Footscray had no knowledge of any wrongdoing by Hobbs until 1992. That year, Graeme Pearce was elevated to the chief executive position and Galimberti demoted to second-in-charge, an arrangement that lasted only six months until Galimberti resumed the top job. ""I remember that Pearce came to me one day in 1992 and said that he'd received a complaint from someone,"" Galimberti says. ""He didn't tell me who the complaint was from. He told me he received a complaint from someone that related to Hobbs giving away membership tickets to attract young children and youth to the club. ""He said he was going to handle the complaint. Sometime later, when he hadn't given me any update on what was happening with the complaint, I spoke to him and said, 'What have you done about the complaint with Hobbs?'. And he said, 'Don't worry about it, I've rung Hobbs and told him he's not to set foot in the club again'. And I never saw Hobbs after that."" Asked how Hobbs was able to gain such wide-ranging access to the club's inner sanctum, Galimberti said Hobbs would not have had a key, but ""the offices might have been open"". ""On match days, the offices were manned by staff,"" Galimberti says. ""There are people coming in and out. There are people attending gates, collecting money, money would be delivered to the office and put in the safe. You wouldn't necessarily need a key, because there is someone in the offices during match days and the office is open for enquiries from the public and for all sorts of reasons. ""He would have had access to the offices but I'm pretty much 100 per cent satisfied that he wouldn't have had a key. We were very heavily dependent on volunteers and people giving up their time to do various jobs, because we couldn't afford to pay people to do it. But there wasn't the checks and balances in those days. There was no working with children checks. ""When you're working with volunteers, it's very difficult because there is no job description. There is no hierarchy in terms of management. There is no payment for their services. So it can be very loose. Back in those days, it was probably very loose — looser than it would be now."" Galimberti said neither he nor any other club officials were questioned by police during the investigation that led to Hobbs's arrest. ""I'm a solicitor and I was a solicitor then,"" Galimberti says. ""If anything like this arose, I would have been made aware of it. If there was a formal investigation and people had to be interviewed, I would have been aware of it."" Galimberti said he ""didn't know why"" the matter was never brought to the attention of the club's board by Graeme Pearce. By the late 1980s, Footscray's finances might have been strained, but even then, the Bulldogs positioned themselves as a community-minded club with a particular focus on child welfare. In 1989 and 1990, when Adam was still being abused at the club, Foostcray launched the Care For Kids program among the initiatives of its Bulldogs Foundation. At the time, Galimberti said it would ""provide leadership, guidance and activities designed to make a difference in the lives of children in the west"". Players acted as ""big brothers"" to troubled local teens, delivering presentations at local schools, preaching the club's values. Care For Kids stickers and T-shirts could be seen all around town. At the time, famed local welfare worker Les Twentyman, also a cousin of Peter Gordon, called it ""a long-term program which could have exciting and positive outcomes"", which in time included $2,000 grants for local schools thanks to one of the program's sponsors, Kemcor. Indeed, documents held at Melbourne's Public Record Office confirm the participation of Adam's school, Tottenham Tech. Adam's mother Lyn now scoffs at the concept. ""Understanding what Adam endured in those club rooms and under the eyes of people higher up than the abusers, I don't trust them,"" she says. ""How could they not have known? They encouraged this person and had him coordinating money. ""They put themselves up on a pedestal, football clubs. But there were no checks. Adam fell through the gaps. A person I know and love has had this happen to them. This has happened in other clubs. It's happened to other children."" For the first time in hours discussing Adam, the gravity of his suffering brings on tears, reducing Lyn to a forlorn whisper: ""They stole his life."" Nobody is more acutely aware of Adam's battle than his wife Natasha, who lives every day with the aftershocks of his abuse. They met in 1996, living in the same apartment block in Elwood. ""I was just awed"", Natasha remembers. She also recognised their shared life experiences — shyness, insecurity, childhood traumas — and felt instantly they would be together one day. ""We were both very broken,"" she says. ""We needed comfort. But it couldn't be any more at that time."" Adam was honest about his anger and the fear he would destroy the relationship before it began. Like Adam, Tash had been bullied from primary school until early adulthood. She's always held a lot inside. Adam describes her as a listener and an endless giver whose first priority is always the happiness and comfort of others. She can't stand seeing anyone excluded. But life was tough in the 10 years before it was ""the right time"" for them, and tougher still in their first year together. ""It probably aged me 10 years,"" Natasha says. Quickly married and pregnant with their son, she was swamped by the added responsibility of caring for someone whose mental health was so fragile. ""We were trying to find him medication that worked,"" she says. ""I felt like I was on eggshells the whole time. It was just so easy to trigger something. I didn't realise how hard it was going to be."" The arrival of their son saved the relationship, ushering in a five-year period in which they ""healed each other"" and ""learned how to be a couple"", slowly and sometimes painfully navigating a more positive course. Motherhood brought Natasha brightness and joy to balance out the darkness Adam could not help but drag home. But just as one stormy era passed, and the family's move to the country heralded a simpler, better life, hostile workplaces played host to the manifestations of Adam's illness. ""He just looked heartbroken and defeated,"" Natasha says. ""He'd come home shaking. He was such a hard worker, such a good guy, such a perfectionist who took pride in his work. And it was so important to him to keep going and supporting his family."" ""But they didn't see that. They saw him as a weakness and bullied him. When he said he couldn't do it any more, I was happy."" In the last two years, Natasha's relief has come with qualifications. In the early years of the relationship, she had been outgoing, her positivity cajoling Adam along. For the last decade, Adam admits, he has been the family's ""anchor"", so plagued by anxieties that even leaving the house is an ordeal. Natasha does not blame him. His guilt upsets her. But she cannot deny her own sadness on the occasions she takes her son out, or on holidays, without Adam. ""I watch families where the mother and fathers are out with their children, and I get sad and cry,"" she says. ""I wish Adam could be there as well, sharing it with us. Even to be able to go for a walk together, the two of us, down the rail track. He's got such a great heart, and I know he wants to live life to the fullest, but I understand and accept why he can't. I know he's never going to be fully healed. ""I just wish people could see what I see. I guess they see someone who is defensive, angry, not friendly. They don't get to see his wit, his funny sense of humour, and that really caring, loyal, fierce protector he is as well. ""He says I helped him, but we both really helped each other. We make each other better, stronger, whole. He's the best guy I've ever met."" Perhaps it is the power of Natasha's love that makes Adam feel fortunate, but he might be the only person on earth who would consider him lucky. He has his family's support, he reminds himself. His children are healthy. It hurt his ego to accept charity from loved ones when his forced retirement depleted the family's finances, but they have a roof over their heads. ""I keep telling Natasha, 'I have no reason to be this depressed',"" Adam says. ""What more could I ask for?"" He's always told himself these lies of self-encouragement. He remembers the first, which rolled around his head after he was first raped by Graeme Hobbs in the Footscray Football Club toilets: ""This won't affect me when I get older."" ""It's ridiculous, isn't it?"" he says. ""I said, 'It won't affect me. I'll get the $20 or the season ticket to give to a friend or family member'."" It is fashionable now to call this mindset resilience. Resilient is an accurate descriptor of Adam but it also diminishes his suffering. Resilience, as it applies to institutional child sexual abuse, over-emphasises the individual fortitude of the survivor. The target of our admiration is obvious. But stories of resilience mitigate and distract us from the failings of the institutions where their abuse occurs, whose shortcomings can be explained away as relics of another time and place, with characters propelled by different values and contexts. The target of our scorn is less clear. ""In my head, I always thought 'I'll ride this out',"" Adam says. ""But it never ended. It's a perpetual hell and yesterday is the same as today. It just demolishes your life. You hope that today you'll sleep better."" He hasn't slept longer than three hours a night in years. To grapple with a small list of his other daily ordeals is to understand the depths of human suffering. ""My normal,"" he admits, ""is most people's worst day."" His PTSD has ""engulfed"" him, hence the trembling hands, his unsteadiness, his racing heartbeat, the anxiety attacks when strangers look at him, his sad slide into a hermit's life. He feels ""stuck"" in his childhood, his personal growth stunted. Far from moments of happiness, family birthdays, Easters, Christmases and many other milestone events are acutely painful — times Adam associates with his abuse. ""I would need money because I wanted to buy someone a present to show my appreciation or whatever, while sacrificing myself at the same time,"" he says. Gift-giving is impossible. Lyn says she has only ever received two birthday cards from Adam, a tally that surprises him. He'd prefer his upcoming 50th birthday pass without comment. ""I've had too many birthdays where I find myself upset with the situation I'm in, whether it was logical or not,"" he says. ""I know it's an anniversary every year. I have an image of walking into Noel's place and the football replay is on, or going to the hotel room and the football replay is on. ""I have more problems with it now than ever — the anniversaries, Saturday early-evenings, having my photo taken, being watched, even touching cash."" Today would have been tough whether he was telling his story or not, because the Bulldogs play Essendon — a day that should prompt fond memories of his grandfather and faraway Saturdays watching his childhood heroes. For Adam, it's one of the worst days on the calendar. When he does sleep, nightmares still overwhelm him — the abusers are the same, but they're taking him somewhere new. ""I also have dreams that I'm at work,"" he says. ""I know in the dream that I don't have to be there, but for some reason I'm there. So, why am I there? I'm there to please them. It's the same as the abuse. ""Don't ever let anyone tell you that you don't feel pain in your dreams."" Another nightmare explains what happens when a man spends his life sparing others from his pain. In it, an incision has been made on the back of Adam's wrist so that a flap of skin opens up, revealing a gory panel of blood and muscle. He responds instinctively, yanking his shirt sleeve down, holding it over the wound so nobody will see. No wonder he clings to music — listening to it, talking about it, making it. ""It's the only healing thing other than having someone by your side,"" he says. ""If it wasn't for music, we probably wouldn't be having this conversation. ""Last night, I put a few chords together, seeing how I could improvise with them. It started getting dark in my room and I had the sound of the trees outside. Today I'll forget it. But it mattered to me then. In that moment, I could switch off."" Why tell his story now? Five years ago, he wanted to share it with the royal commission but was not ready. Now, 38 years after his abuse began, he just wants it to stop controlling his life. ""I've lost a lot of years from a mental health point of view, not being able to achieve what I set out to achieve when I was a kid,"" he says. ""I'm getting close to 50 and things are going to shit again, but in a way that I never could have imagined. ""And it makes sense. A lot of the people I used to see in self-help groups were in their 40s and they were a mess. Guys who were my age now. I just thought it was because they hadn't dealt with it all those years. But it wasn't. ""Something happens to them in their 40s that makes them have to face what they're facing. For me, it was like, 'What do I have to face?'. I said to my doctor, 'I'm done with waiting until I think I'm ready'. That's like waiting to sleep properly again."" Reflecting on Adam's life, Lyn admits she is a pessimist, always pondering the worst 'what-ifs'. In her heart she hopes today is the day her son fights back and ""feels proud of his whole story"". Naturally, she also ponders the alternative: ""What if he doesn't?"" She knows there is a chasm between what she wants for Adam and what he can realistically have. She can't stop herself from comparing his life with his brother's. ""What's happened to his brother should have happened to Adam — a career, music, fun,"" she says. ""His brother lives in the country now, and he'll call and say he's broken a chainsaw. I say 'that's an incident, not a disaster'. Adam has had disaster after disaster and they're two very different things. To lose the boy when he's becoming a man is heartbreaking."" And then she ponders one final 'what-if', one she knows Adam has pondered often too: ""What if he'd never gone to the Footscray Football Club?"" Do you have more information on this story?

19,"'Trophies, medals and money don't mean as much as human connection': The philosophy of boxer Harry Garside",sport," Sport Harry Garside prepares to defend his Australian lightweight title — but his priorities go well beyond boxing For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Harry Garside rose to prominence after winning Australia's first Olympic boxing medal in 33 years at the Tokyo Games. It wasn't just that historic bronze, but his painted nails and passion for ballet that won over so many different fans. ""It's been pretty crazy since the Olympics last year,"" Garside said. ""I'm the type of person who tries to grab every opportunity the universe throws at me."" The 24-year-old doesn't shy away from challenges. Just one month after claiming the Australian lightweight title in his second professional bout with a unanimous decision over Manuer Matet in Sydney, Garside is gearing up for his next fight. Australian lightweight boxer Harry Garside was considered an easybeat in his early years in the fight game, but the ballet-dancing plumber from Melbourne has made quite the impression. ""It's a quick turnaround. Not many fighters are doing it these days, but I'm pretty old school with my belief and the way I train,"" he said. Having moved to 2-0 in his professional career, his next opponent is Tasmanian Layton McFerran (5-1) on May 11 at the Newcastle Entertainment Centre. ""I don't know too much about him and have struggled to find footage of him, but he's only lost one of his six fights,"" Garside said. ""He is as tough as nails and he's coming to win."" Garside's triumph over Matet was the first time he fought past three rounds. It was a test of mental endurance as much as physical, and one Garside embraces, as he dreams of one day winning a world title. ""I remember getting to round eight and thinking 'I wish I could sit down', but it felt good, and I was really excited to go 10 rounds,"" he said. ""I can't wait for world titles and boxing 12 rounds."" Garside and Nikita Tszyu are both featured on the undercard of the main event between Paul Gallen (12-1-1) and Kris Terzievski (10-1-1) on Wednesday. Tszyu (1-0), the youngest son of former world champion Kostya and brother to world-ranked Tim, will face Melbourne's Mason Smith (5-0). Former NRL star Gallen and fellow Australian heavyweight Terzievski will be aiming to create Australian boxing history, with the winner to be crowned with dual titles for the first time in more than 100 years. Garside credits Gallen for what he has done for the sport of boxing and providing young fighters like himself a platform. He said he could not wait to fight under Gallen. ""The best thing I love about Paul Gallen is what you see is what you get,"" Garside said. ""He speaks his mind, he's unapologetically Paul Gallen."" Garside has an unassuming confidence and the former plumber from Melbourne's eastern suburbs is proudest for being known as the ballet dancing boxer. The youngest of three boys, Garside wanted to do ballet and dance for many years but was too afraid to tell his dad and older brothers. ""I finally built up the courage in 2019 to start ballet and I absolutely love it,"" he said. ""It's helped my boxing heaps and one day when I'm good enough I will do a performance for sure."" While Garside can pack a pirouette as well as he does a punch, he wants to be known as more than just a boxer. Over the past two years, he has been focused on separating his boxing persona from his authentic self. ""At the end of the day, trophies, medals and money don't mean as much to me [as] human connection does,"" he said. ""At the end of my life, I want to be remembered as a good person, rather than a good boxer."" Sporting nails painted with different colours, Garside's mission to break gender stereotypes came from his own struggles and he hopes it inspires young people to embrace their quirks. ""There were so many things pushed on me when I was growing up about how I was supposed to act,"" he said. ""By painting my nails, I hope young people can see that I don't have to play the roles society pushes on me and I can be who I am."" Garside credits the Reach foundation, a youth not-for-profit organisation aimed at building social and emotional development, for giving him the courage to be comfortable in his own skin. ""They came to my school when I was 16 years old,"" he said. ""My involvement with them took me on a journey where I learnt to love myself — the good, the bad and ugly."" One of his life goals is to get combat sports integrated into the school system. While boxing may be high risk, Garside believes lower-impact versions, such as judo and jiu-jitsu, could be suitable alternatives. ""I remember as a young person going through a lot between the ages of 10 to 18 years,"" he said. ""The body is changing, there are so many emotions running through your body and you're feeling things for the first time."" Physical benefits aside, Garside said such sports could teach young people other valuable life lessons, such as discipline, respect, confidence and self-love. Attributes Garside now has an abundance of.

20,Trans women's participation in sport has been framed as an election issue. This is what some trans athletes think,sport," Sport For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency If you've been following the federal election campaign, you'd be forgiven for thinking trans women's participation in sport is the biggest issue facing the nation. Over the past week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his controversial ""captain's pick"" for Warringah, Katherine Deves, have been drawn into an increasingly ugly debate about a private member's bill by Liberal senator Claire Chandler which seeks to ban trans women from participating in women's sport by refusing to recognise them as women. Deves, in particular, has been rebuked for a range of extremist comments, including video that has surfaced of her likening her lobbying on the issue to standing up against the Holocaust. Although Morrison has said the Coalition ""does not have any plans"" to sponsor such a bill, he has previously labelled it ""terrific"" and said he shares Deves's and Chandler's views on trans participation in sport. But while those who believe trans women should be excluded from sport have defended their right to ""free speech"", little airtime has been given to examining the science behind the claims being made. So what does the science say about trans women and sport? Associate Professor Ada Cheung is a principal research fellow in endocrinology at Austin Health and leads the Trans Health Research program in partnership with the University of Melbourne. She says medical transitions have a range of complicated impacts on the body which throw into doubt claims about trans women having a ""biological advantage"" in sport. Trans women, she says, will often start taking a form of estrogen as well as testosterone blockers to increase their estrogen and decrease their testosterone levels to a more ""typical female range"". ""When they do that, they get physical changes to their muscle and fat, so they typically gain fat and lose muscle,"" she says, citing a study she co-authored in 2021. More recent research to come out of the Trans Health Research program, she adds, shows trans women also have lower bone density than cisgender men. She refers to another study, which followed a group of trans women undergoing hormone therapy over a three-year period, and showed that their muscle mass, power and strength decreased. ""But that particular study only involved 19 women, and they didn't have an adequate control group to compare with,"" cautions Cheung. ""Transgender research is in its infancy. There's hardly any research in this space. I actually cannot say for certain whether trans women retain a physical advantage [over cisgender women] or not."" However Cheung, who also treats trans clients as a doctor, says anecdotal evidence does not support the theory trans athletes have an ""advantage"". ""My patients tell me they don't [have an advantage], my patients tell me they lose strength and can't do the physical work that they used to,"" she says. ""But I can't tell you [for certain] because the science just hasn't been done, which is what we (the researchers) are trying to fix."" On the idea that trans women might pose a safety threat to cisgender women, however, Cheung is emphatic. ""There is no data to suggest that safety [for cisgender women] is worse when trans women are competing,"" she says. Cheung says that is partly because so few trans women play sport or exercise in the first place. Focus has once again turned to the issue of transgender women in sport, leaving more significant issues unchallenged. She points to an American Human Rights Campaign study from 2017 which showed that, nationally, 68 per cent of high school students were participating in team sport. For the LGBTQI+ community, however, that number dropped to 24 per cent, while for trans women, it was as low as 12 per cent. ""They aren't participating in sport because they fear discrimination,"" Cheung says. ""You know, [they're dealing with issues like] what bathroom do I go to? What change room do I use? What uniform am I going to wear? What if they found out [I'm trans]?"" Roxy Tickle is a trans woman in her early 50s who participates in the North Coast Hockey league for the East Lismore club. She says recent public conversation about trans participation in sport has taken a toll on her mental health. ""It has been really distressing,"" she says. ""It has pushed my anxiety through the roof. I've had to increase my anti-anxiety medication to counter this."" Tickle isn't alone in this regard, with national LGBTQI+ peer support and referral hotline QLife reportedly experiencing a 53 per cent spike in calls on days with significant media coverage of Deves's transphobic views. On average, calls to the hotline have also reportedly increased by 19 per cent since the election campaign started. ""This has real-world implications for a problem that doesn't actually resonate with my lived experience,"" Tickle says. Tickle's first foray into women's sport came in 2019 when a friend asked her if she would play in the Lismore Masters in softball. Tickle had only recently transitioned but was at the time taking testosterone blockers which qualified as a banned substance. As a result, she sought information from Sport Integrity Australia (formerly ASADA) about whether she could apply for a therapeutic-use exemption to play while taking the blockers. ""It took three months to find out whether I could play,"" she says. Eventually, it was decided that because it was a standalone event and did not come under the NSW Softball or Softball Australia umbrella she could participate. ""The Masters weekend was nine games in three days or something like that, and I couldn't walk straight for about a week [afterwards],"" she says. ""Here's my advantage: I was the only one who couldn't play the last game. I couldn't run, I walked. And it took me about 10 times longer to walk across the field than it did anyone else."" Despite her fitness challenges, Tickle's experience playing softball gave her the confidence to approach a local hockey club that she had been assured was LGBTQI+ friendly. ""I went down, and I was like, 'Hi, I'm Roxy. Is it OK if I come and play?'"" Tickle anticipated further questions about her gender identity but instead a club member simply asked which grade she wanted to play in. ""I said, 'Probably the bottom one. I'm not fit, and I'm really not that good,'"" Tickle recalls. ""And she just said, 'OK, we'll find somewhere for you Roxy.' ""I burst into tears … this is what a lot of people don't understand — we spend so many years not belonging anywhere. ""I hated myself for decades, and now so many people [at the club] love me. I've found somewhere I fit, and it's just been brilliant. It's the reason I'm still here."" A number of other trans women athletes contacted by the ABC echoed these sentiments, with 17-year-old Emily, which is not her real name, saying her experience playing basketball for a Queer Sporting Alliance team had been life changing. ""Being able to participate in team sports gets me up in the morning,"" she says. ""It encourages me to exercise and eat healthily. ""It has also encouraged me to love my body, to know that we are all different. ""As a trans athlete, I am scared about not being able to participate in sport. ""Being an athlete is a core part of my identity, and without it I am unsure how I would cope."" In 2019, Merrilee Barnes worked as director of Inclusive Sport at Sport Australia, which had commissioned the Australian Human Rights Commission to draft the guidelines for the inclusion of transgender and gender-diverse people in sport, which have been endorsed by a wide range of national sporting organisations (NSOs). Those NSOs include the AFL, Cricket Australia, Football Federation Australia, NRL, Netball Australia, Rugby Australia and Tennis Australia. The underlying principle of the guidelines, as set out by sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins, is that ""participation in sport is a human right"". ""This makes it essential that everyone has the opportunity to participate in sport, regardless of their sex or gender identity,"" Jenkins writes in the foreword. As part of the process of developing the guidelines, Barnes and others undertook consultations with over 100 stakeholders — including clubs, player associations, state and territory human rights commissions, legal and medical experts, academics, and cisgender and transgender/gender diverse athletes. She said that process failed to uncover any significant concerns about trans and gender participation in sport. ""There were the odd outliers but overall they were all in support of inclusion,"" she says. ""We never had any complaints at Sport Australia. This was never presented as trans women taking over women's sport or a safety issue for women and girls."" The Coalition's Minister for Aged Care Richard Colbeck (then-sport minister) also subsequently encouraged ""all sports clubs"" to embrace the guidelines. A fact that has not received enough airtime in the current debate, Barnes says, is that the under section 42 of the sex discrimination act, sporting groups are already allowed to discriminate where ""strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant"". For example, the AFL has a gender diversity policy that requires trans women to prove that their testosterone levels are below a specific limit over a two-year period. They also have to submit a range of other data including their height, weight, bench press records and sprint times. This data in turn informs the league's decision on whether a trans or gender-diverse athlete is considered to have an ""unreasonable advantage"" over their cisgender peers. While such policies can and have been critiqued for their fairness, Barnes says they prove sports already police trans and gender-diverse participation in sport where it is deemed relevant. Barnes also points out that when trans athletes have been included in elite competition, they have far from ""dominated"". Despite being eligible for Olympic participation since 2004, only a handful of openly transgender or non-binary athletes have competed in the Games, including New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard. Hubbard, the first openly trans woman to compete, finished last in her division, failing to complete a lift. But while debate often focuses on elite competition, Barnes says, the impact is felt at the community level. ""Most people just want to play sport to have fun,"" she says. We've compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQI+ people, their families and friends. ""People who play sport know it's about more than just winning. It's about actually playing with people and getting to know people."" Cheung agrees, saying fearmongering risks the health and wellbeing of everyday trans and gender-diverse people. ""This is a community that needs the physical and mental health benefits of exercise because they have a higher risk of heart disease, depression and anxiety, suicide attempts and suicides,"" she says. ""They need that sense of belonging because often trans people don't have that. They need to be included in communities and reap the benefits of exercise like everyone else.""

21,Renewed calls to end greyhound racing after three dogs euthanised within days,sport,"  Three greyhounds euthanised within eight days after racing on West Australian tracks For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Pecan Minelli became the third greyhound to be euthanised at a West Australian racetrack in eight days after breaking a leg while racing on Tuesday night. Speaking to ABC Perth's Mornings program, Greens MLC Brad Pettitt said the sport, with its dwindling public support, should be phased out over a two-year period. ""We're going to be asking some questions of the Racing and Gaming Minister [Tony Buti] through the parliamentary process,"" he said. ""Too many dogs are getting injured and too many are getting killed."" Mr Buti told the ABC he was greatly concerned about animal welfare. ""I've asked Racing and Wagering WA (RWWA) ... that welfare has to be fundamental to the way they manage the sport,"" Mr Buti said. Mr Pettitt is calling on the state government to release greyhound racing from the sale of the TAB and is facilitating an e-petition to parliament by Free the Hounds, a non-for-profit group campaigning to end greyhound racing in WA. Free the Hounds president Melissa Harrison said three greyhound deaths in eight days was unprecedented in the years she had been following the sport. ""Minister Buti needs to look at what's going on at these tracks and why it's occurring,"" Ms Harrison said. ""We know there's upgrades happening, but they haven't been done properly if Northam is anything to go by."" The Northam racetrack, which closed in 2019 because of the pandemic and for upgrades and maintenance, had a major incident on the first day of returned racing last Monday when winning dog Zipping Jade had to be euthanised after sustaining considerable injuries from colliding with a catching pen. In relation to the incident, RWWA chief racing integrity officer Denis Borovica said the Northam track would remain closed until the stewards were satisfied racing could safely return. ""The incident was deeply upsetting for everyone in the racing community and a review is underway,"" he said. Want more local news? Sign up for the weekly ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt email newsletter Mr Borovica said the state's three greyhound racetracks – Mandurah, Cannington and Northam – were being upgraded after being assessed by University of Technology Sydney's Professor David Eager.

23,Kane double sinks Arsenal in crucial North London derby win for Spurs,sport,"  Harry Kane guides Tottenham to crucial North London Derby win over Arsenal For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tottenham has revived its hopes of beating Arsenal to the final Champions League qualification position by overwhelming the fierce North London rival 3-0, their biggest derby win since the 1980s. Harry Kane scored twice — including one from the penalty spot — and Son Heung-min added the other just after half-time in Thursday's crucial clash as the race for European places comes down to the wire. The win moved Tottenham just a point behind fourth-placed Arsenal, which had centre back Rob Holding sent off in the 33rd minute when they were 1-0 down. There are two games remaining for each team and fifth-placed Spurs have what looks an easier finish to the season than Arsenal. While Spurs face two of the bottom four — Burnley and already-relegated Norwich — Arsenal must travel to Newcastle before a home game against Everton. Arsenal was responsible for its own downfall, with full back Cedric Soares barging into Son at the back post for the penalty that Kane rolled into the corner in the 22nd minute. Holding, already booked for pulling back Son, then opted to stick out an elbow to block off the South Korea forward rather than track his run following Eric Dier's ball over the top of the Arsenal defence. Holding connected with the face of Son — who slumped to the ground — and was shown a second yellow card in the 33rd. It got worse for Arsenal four minutes later when Son swung over a corner from the right, with Rodrigo Bentancur heading the ball towards goal, and Kane stooping to head home at the back post from barely a metre out. Son moved one goal behind Liverpool's Mohamed Salah in the race to be the league's top scorer by curling home the third goal from inside the area in the 47th minute. Son has 10 goals in his past eight league games and is on 21 for the campaign, his best yet for Spurs. A miserable evening for Arsenal was capped by defender Gabriel hobbling off with an apparent right hamstring injury. With Holding suspended and Ben White only fit enough to make the bench after a recent injury, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's central-defensive resources are being stretched at just the wrong time. Manchester City and Liverpool are already sure of being in next season's Champions League, while third-placed Chelsea is set to join them, sitting four points ahead of Arsenal and needing one win from their remaining games against Leicester and already-relegated Watford. It means Arsenal and Tottenham look to be battling for the final spot in a race that should go down to the final day of the season. Tottenham arguably could have won by more to boost their already-massive goal difference over Arsenal, but it remains in fifth with the Gunners still in the driving seat in the battle for fourth place. The gap between them is now only one point with both sides having two games remaining. Arsenal face Newcastle United away and Everton at home while Tottenham host Burnley and finish at relegated Norwich City in the penultimate round of the season.

24,Caleb Ewan falls short of first Giro d'Italia stage win in photo finish,sport,"  Caleb Ewan falls agonisingly short of first Giro d'Italia 2022 stage win in photo finish For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Caleb Ewan has been left crestfallen by the narrowest of defeats on the sixth stage of the Giro d'Italia after an exhilarating blanket finish featuring the race's three fastest men. The Australian flyer looked as if he was going to pick up his first victory of the race after five hours in the saddle from Palmi to Scalea in southern Italy on Thursday, particularly after he swept past British great Mark Cavendish just before the line. But on his outside, French sprinter Arnaud Demare swooped, and with one final ""bike throw"" lunge towards the line, edged to his second win in consecutive days in the closest of finishes to the 192 kilometre stage. It could hardly have been closer. There was so little between the top two that neither man dared celebrate until the official news came through that Groupama-FDJ's Demare had nicked the decision after a study of the photo. Cavendish, already a stage winner, was half a bike length down in third. Sydneysider Ewan could find no consolation in defeat. When a reporter suggested to him at the end that he was at least showing his excellent sprinting form for the rest of the race, he could only sigh: ""Yeah, but second … it's not so good. ""Yeah, disappointing. Super hard and super messy [in the finish] but Demare was just faster."" After time to reflect, he was a bit more sanguine about the loss, quoted on his team Lotto-Soudal's website as saying: ""I just got beaten by an inch … we need to take away from today that it could have gone our way as well. ""The shape and the team are there and, of course, I am keen on taking revenge."" It was, though, another deflating setback for Ewan, who has had a tough time in the four sprint stages contested so far as he seeks to take his tally of Giro stage wins to six. He suffered a fall in the denouement on the first day in Hungary, was out of position when he next had a chance on the third stage, and got dropped in the mountains before the bunch finish on Wednesday. Demare, the three-time national road race champion, looked in scintillating form as he took his seventh career stage win on the Giro — more than any won by a French rider. ""It was very tight. I had the feeling I had won but it was hot so I waited for the photo finish,"" Demare said. ""A win is sometimes decided by very little. … I only had 100 metres to overhaul Cavendish. I threw my bike on the line and it made the difference. ""Many people underestimate me but it's my 86th career victory today. It's wonderful,"" he added. Spain's Juan Pedro Lopez, of Trek-Segafredo, maintained his overall 39-second lead over Lennard Kamna with no changes to the general classification picture, as INEOS's Richie Porte remains top Australian in ninth place, two minutes four seconds behind.

25,Melbourne Cup winner Verry Elleegant set for shock switch to France,sport," Sport Melbourne Cup winner Verry Elleegant in shock France switch For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The 2021 Melbourne Cup winner Verry Elleegant has figured in a shock stable change to accommodate the overseas ambitions of the champion racemare's high-profile ownership group. One of the most decorated racehorses in Australian racing, Verry Elleegant will be moved from Chris Waller's all-conquering stable to the Chantilly yard of leading French trainer Francis-Henri Graffard. Travel plans for the winner of almost $15 million in prize money will be finalised once she finishes spelling after an autumn campaign that ended on a flat note when she was unplaced in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Randwick in April. It is expected Verry Elleegant will be aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, one of the world's signature thoroughbred races. Verry Elleegant is raced in a partnership that includes well-known Australian owners Brae Sokolski and Ozzie Kheir. In a statement released through Waller, the ownership group said that for Verry Elleegant to race against the best stayers in the world it would necessitate the mare being trained abroad. ""After much deliberation we came to the realisation that if we want to campaign her in Europe, we need to do it properly and send her to be trained and prepared in the northern hemisphere,"" their statement read. ""Bringing her to Europe early opens up a number of new possibilities, one of which is running in the Arc. ""However we will just keep an open mind on her program until deeper in her preparation with Francis."" ""We are incredibly excited about the journey ahead and showcasing her on the world stage. We know win, lose or draw she will do us, Australia and of course New Zealand proud."" Waller trained Verry Elleegant to win 11 Group One races, including the 2020 Caulfield Cup and last year's Melbourne Cup. Life for Winx trainer Chris Waller involves an elite team of helpers, managing stress, avoiding risk, and watching her previous wins. But her owners believe Verry Elleegant would be handicapped out of this year's spring Cups double, limiting her domestic opportunities in races at 2,400m and beyond. Waller, who also trained champion mare Winx, said he was privileged to have had an association with Verry Elleegant. ""It has been an honour to have trained Verry Elleegant for a major part of her career,"" he said. ""She has given us so many great thrills over a number of years and we are very proud of her.""

26,Australia to host 2027 men's and 2029 women's Rugby World Cups,sport," Sport Australia confirmed as host of the men's 2027 and women's 2029 Rugby World Cups For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian Rugby has been given a huge boost by World Rugby, being named as host of the 2027 men's and 2029 women's Rugby World Cup tournaments. World Rugby confirmed the decision at a council meeting in Dublin on Thursday. ""This is an historic day for rugby in Australia,"" Rugby Australia Chairman Hamish McLennan said. ""We're beyond thrilled to be welcoming not one, but two Rugby World Cups to our shores."" Australia, two-time winners of the men's World Cup in 1991 and 1999, had previously been named as the preferred candidate to host both tournaments. It last hosted the men's World Cup in 2003, losing to England curtesy of an extra time Jonny Wilkinson drop goal in a dramatic Sydney final. None of the previous nine editions of the women's version of the tournament have been held in Australia. Rugby Australia estimates that hosting the back-to-back tournaments will provide a $1.8 billion injection into the local economy. Confirmation of the awarding of the World Cups will be a welcome boost to Rugby Australia, which has struggled financially in recent years. Rugby Australia needed a $14 million loan from World Rugby last year after pre-existing financial issues spiralled into a full-blown crisis because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rugby Australia terminated more than 40 per cent of staff at the start of the pandemic in 2020 — the culmination of a horror period in which former chief executive Raelene Castle left the organisation, it paid an out-of-court settlement to Israel Folau, and it faced a declining supporter base and allegations of mismanagement from former players. But with interest gathered from World Cups in 2027 and 2029, the Commonwealth Games in 2026 and the Brisbane Olympics in 2032, plus the financial windfall of a British and Irish Lions tour in 2025, Rugby Australia has the chance to recapture the imagination of the sporting public. ""Today is a significant moment in time for our game,"" McLennan said. ""It's a game-changer for rugby in this country, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalise and secure the future of the sport here and see the game we all love grow and thrive for years to come. ""We look forward to working together with World Rugby, our member unions and government partners over the coming years to ensure that we make the most of this opportunity and continue the resurgence of rugby in this country."" Two-time World Cup winning Wallaby Tim Horan wrote on social media that being awarded the two tournaments is ""the most significant moment in Australia rugby's history, since winning RWC 1991."". ""Hosting men's 2027 and women's 2029 RWC will grow participation and provide financial security for our game for generations,"" he wrote. World Rugby also confirmed that the men's and women's Rugby World Cups would head to the USA for the first time in 2031 and 2033 respectively. The USA will be just the second tier-two nation to host the men's global showpiece, after Japan in 2019. ""I speak for the rugby community and fans across the United States when I express our sincere gratitude to World Rugby for their trust and endorsement of our vision to grow this incredible sport exponentially across our country,"" USA Rugby boss Ross Young said. ""USA Rugby will now venture into a new era and ensure the sport's most treasured event is a springboard for creating lasting, sustainable enthusiasm and passion for rugby from coast to coast."" The USA won the first women's World Cup in 1991 and were beaten finalists in the next two competitions although their men have never reached the quarter finals. It was also confirmed that England will host the 2025 women's World Cup as World Rugby set its agenda for the next decade. World Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said the announcement provided ""unprecedented certainty and an unparalleled opportunity to accelerate the growth and impact of rugby globally"".

28,Former NZ captain Brendon McCullum named England test head coach,sport,"  Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum named England Test head coach For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum has been appointed head coach of England's test team, the country's cricket board said on Thursday. McCullum replaced Chris Silverwood who left the role in February after England was thrashed 4-0 in the Ashes in Australia. Paul Collingwood stepped in as a caretaker coach. McCullum, 40, is currently in charge of Indian Premier League Twenty20 side Kolkata Knight Riders. But the England and Wales Cricket Board said he would be in place to start his role when New Zealand visited for a three-test series starting at Lord's on June 2. ""We are delighted to confirm Brendon as England men's test head coach. It has been a real privilege to get to know him and understand his views and vision for the game,"" board managing director Rob Key said in a statement. ""He has a recent history of changing cricket culture and environments for the better, and I believe he is the person to do that for England's red-ball cricket. ""We were incredibly fortunate to have a seriously strong list of quality candidates for the post, with Brendon demonstrating he was our number one choice."" Former South Africa and India head coach Gary Kirsten had been linked with the role, while Collingwood was also considered. McCullum played the last of his 101 tests at Christchurch in 2016 against Australia, where he hit the fastest ever century in the format (54 balls). He finished his career with 6,453 runs including 12 hundreds and 31 half-centuries. He will be tasked with working alongside newly-appointed test captain Ben Stokes to get England out of a slump after the team won only one of their last 17 matches. Key described the pairing as a ""formidable coach and captain partnership"". McCullum said he understood the job ahead. ""In taking this role on, I am acutely aware of the significant challenges the team faces at present, and I strongly believe in my ability to help the team emerge as a stronger force once we've confronted them head-on,"" McCullum said. ""Ben Stokes is the perfect character to inspire change around him, and I look forward to working closely with him to build a successful unit around us."" Former England captain Michael Atherton said McCullum was a ""very bold and imaginative choice"" by managing director Key. Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast. Apart from coaching the Kolkata IPL franchise, McCullum also worked with their sister team, Trinbago Knight Riders, in the T20 Caribbean Premier League. Atherton said McCullum's limited coaching experience was not a concern. ""His limited coaching experience has come in the IPL… But he did play 100 tests, scored a test match triple hundred and he was very significant in test cricket in his own right,"" Atherton said. ""… As a captain and as a leader, he's got plenty of experience in test match cricket.""

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) yesterday advised travellers to reconsider their need to visit Sri Lanka due to the security situation. Australia is due to play three T20 Internationals, five One-Day Internationals and two Test matches in Kandy, Colombo and Galle from early June to mid-July. A Cricket Australia spokesperson said the situation was being watched closely. ""Our players and support staff have been briefed and will continue to be kept up to date,"" the spokesperson said. Talks are ongoing between Australian officials, their Sri Lankan counterparts and DFAT but with three weeks until the scheduled departure of the squad there are not yet any changes to the schedule. In a bid to ease political unrest Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa will appoint a new prime minister and cabinet this week, but it's not clear whether this will end the violent demonstrations. Sri Lankans blame the government of former prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa for an economic collapse and shortages of food, fuel and medicine that unleashed widespread protests. Australia's cricketers visited Pakistan for the first time since 1998 earlier this year following a period during which the threat of terrorism in that country was deemed too great a risk.

30,Former England Test cricketer Graham Thorpe 'seriously ill',sport,"  Former England Test cricketer Graham Thorpe 'seriously ill' For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Former England cricketer and men's batting coach Graham Thorpe is in hospital after becoming ""seriously ill"". The 52-year-old, who played 100 Test matches for England over 12 years, is being treated for an unknown illness and had recently accepted the job as head coach of Afghanistan. England's Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) made the announcement on Tuesday about the former batter's health. ""Graham Thorpe has recently fallen seriously ill and is currently in hospital receiving treatment,"" they said. ""His prognosis is unclear at this stage and we ask for privacy for him and his family at this time. Our thoughts are with Graham and his family."" His former county team Surrey, where he spent his entire first-class career, wrote on Twitter their thoughts were with Thorpe and his family. ""He is an icon of the English game, known by millions of cricket fans and forever a favourite son of Surrey CCC."" Thorpe made his Test match debut for England against Australia at Nottingham in 1993. After facing just 13 balls for six runs in his first innings, the left-hander announced himself with an unbeaten 114 in the second innings. He partnered with Graham Gooch in that innings for a partnership of 150 runs after they had fallen to 5-159. The partnership helped England secure a draw. Thorpe scored 6744 runs in his Test career with an average of 44.66. Thorpe's highest Test score came in 2002 when he was man of the match in England's first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch. His 200 not out in the second innings set up a 98-run win for the visitors, who would go on to draw the three-match series 1-1.

31,Stokes smashes county cricket record with 17 sixes,sport," Sport England Test captain Ben Stokes smashes county cricket record with 17 sixes in an innings For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A week after being appointed England Test captain, Ben Stokes livened up county cricket by smashing 161 off 88 balls on return for Durham against Worcestershire in an innings that included a record 17 sixes. He beat the record for most sixes in a County Championship innings, which was previously shared by Andrew Symonds and Graham Napier, who both hit 16 in 1995 and 2011 respectively. Stokes, who recently took over from Joe Root as England captain, notched up his ton in just 64 deliveries with a massive six that sailed into the stands. It was the fastest century by a Durham player in the history of county cricket, eclipsing Paul Collingwood's 75-ball hundred against Somerset in 2005. He also came close to striking six sixes in an over, a feat that only two men in the history of first-class cricket have ever achieved: Sir Garfield Sobers in 1968 and Ravi Shastri in 1985. Unfortunately, the final ball of that over went for four. None-the-less, it was the second time in his county career that the all-rounder had cleared the rope in five consecutive deliveries. Stokes had notched 147 not-out before lunch, including a remarkable 10-ball sequence in which he secured 53 runs. He'd already reached 15 sixes by this stage before sending Ben Gibbon's first ball into a sightscreen. Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast. He was eventually caught in the deep going for his 18th six, finding the fielder a couple of metres inside the rope. Durham declared at 6-580. ""It was a good day, wasn't it?"" Stokes said afterwards. He will start his stint as Test captain, attempting to revive an ailing England team, when New Zealand visits next month.

32,Hot Dogs start enough to see off Pies and stay in touch with top eight,sport," Sport Western Bulldogs beat Collingwood by 48 points to keep in touch with top eight For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Western Bulldogs' AFL season is back on track after an early blast set up a vital and convincing 48-point victory over Collingwood at Docklands Stadium. Entering Friday night's match under the pump at 3-5, last year's grand finalists came out firing by playing their best football all year to boot the first six goals of the match. Collingwood steadied after the first quarter onslaught to remain in the contest until midway through the third term before the Bulldogs again pulled away to lead by 46 points at the final break and prevail 14.15 (99) to 7.9 (51). Former Collingwood midfielder Adam Treloar starred for the Dogs, picking up 36 touches and slotting three goals in one of the best outings of his stellar 199-game career to be awarded the the Bob Rose-Charlie Sutton medal as best on ground. Treloar now has a 2-0 record for the Bulldogs playing Collingwood after he was controversially traded out of the Magpies at the end of 2020. The 29-year-old spearheaded a midfield that dominated the Pies as Bailey Smith (41 disposals), Jack Macrae (37) and Tom Liberatore (30) helped the Bulldogs win the clearances 43-27. Treloar, key forward Aaron Naughton, Josh Dunkley and exciting newcomer Buku Khamis all kicked three goals each for the Bulldogs. Young Collingwood forward Oliver Henry showed flashes of promise but was left to rue several missed shots at goal and a critical first quarter turnover. Henry's pass from barely 40m out was cut off, before Treloar kicked a goal at the other end and the Bulldogs quickly slammed through another four majors. In a concern for the Bulldogs, Naughton appeared troubled by a knee injury for most of the game and hobbled to the bench late in the final quarter. The night started in tough fashion for Collingwood after captain Scott Pendlebury was a late withdrawal through illness. Magpies defender Jack Madgen looks set for a long stint on the sidelines after hurting his shoulder in the second quarter and was subbed out for Finlay Macrae. The Bulldogs will have an opportunity to even the ledger at 5-5 next weekend when they host Gold Coast in Ballarat, while Collingwood (4-5) travel to Perth Stadium to face Fremantle.

33,Dani Laidley arrest saga comes to close with charges against police officer dropped,sport,"  All charges dropped against Victoria Police officer who shared details of Dani Laidley's 2020 arrest For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A two-year saga that filled tabloid pages has drawn to a close with the charges against the last police officer involved in the leaking of Dani Laidley's arrest dropped. Constable David Hall was charged with two counts of unauthorised disclosure of police information for sharing details of the former North Melbourne Football Club coach's arrest in May 2020. The charges were struck out in the Ringwood Magistrates' Court on Friday morning. It comes after two other police officers implicated in the scandal also had their charges dropped earlier this year. Detective Leading Senior Constable Murray Gentner — accused of accessing Ms Laidley's arrest record and sharing it in a Whatsapp group — successfully challenged six criminal charges levelled at him. Senior Constable Shane Reid was cleared of four charges in April after admitting to taking a photo of Ms Laidley during her arrest and sharing it. Ms Laidley had been arrested for stalking, and was spared a conviction and placed on an adjourned undertaking instead. Ms Laidley launched legal action in Victoria's Supreme Court following the scandal which outed her as transgender, claiming Victoria Police was liable for the alleged actions of three police officers. Chief Commissioner Shane Patton publicly apologised following the incident and said that Victoria Police had done the wrong thing. ""It was a breach of Dani's human rights, it's inappropriate conduct, it's not acceptable,"" he told ABC Melbourne radio.

34,Which locations have provided the AFL with the most talent and the best players?,sport," Sport Inside the game: Which locations have provided the AFL with the most talent and the best players? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency There must be something in the water of the Murray River. With the likes of reigning Brownlow medallist Ollie Wines (Echuca) learning the game on the banks of the mighty Murray, the areas surrounding the river are officially the most fertile breeding grounds for VFL/AFL talent. North of the river, players like Tom Hawkins and Shane Crawford (Finley), Leo Barry (Deniliquin) and John Longmire (Corowa-Rutherglen) have put their marks on the game, leading to that region being the most prosperous per capita for producing VFL/AFL footballers in the draft era, as comprehensively logged by Dave Slutzkin at DraftGuru. Just south of the river, areas like Shepparton and Hume — including the towns of Wodonga and Wangaratta — also punch well above their weight. If the Murray is the lifeblood of Australia, it's also the heartbeat of football. Australian rules football is truly a national game, with players in the top flight hailing from across the country. The face of the game at the top level is shaped by the body of grassroots players underneath, from a variety of backgrounds and locales. The red dust bowls of the centre of the country differ from the lush green fields of the south, but the game played on them is the same. Footy isn't always about the big stadiums and strobing lights. It's also about the heartlands, and where the game is played every weekend, rain, hail or shine. The Murray isn't the only place to produce a plethora of top-end talent. Each state has its own strongholds. In absolute terms, the Melbourne metropolitan areas produces the largest amount of AFL talent anywhere in Australia. Within Melbourne, a notable hotspot is the Bayside area where the likes of Chris Judd and Jobe Watson (both East Sandringham JFC) learned the game. In the regional areas, the ever-productive Geelong and Ballarat locales have produced dozens of footballers over the years. Perhaps a lesser-known hotspot on the fringes of Melbourne has been the Yarra Ranges, where the likes of Sam Mitchell, Brett Ratten, Rory Sloane and David Wirrpanda plied their trade at clubs like Mooroolbark and Healesville. Then there's Warrnambool, which seems to breed them to last, with the most games per capita of any area in Victoria. Draftguru's data doesn't record local clubs for most players from South Australia or Western Australia, recognising the strong pathways with the SANFL and WAFL. Each club in these leagues has their own recruiting zones, with rights over young players developed in the areas. This still gives a picture over what clubs and regions have had the most success in producing AFL players. In South Australia, Norwood has produced the most AFL players in the draft era, with Port Adelaide producing the most 100-game players. That would be no shock to followers of the South Australian footy scene. In Western Australia, Claremont and East Fremantle have been strongholds, with the most players and 100-game players respectively. East Fremantle's success has come despite the club not winning a WAFL flag since 1998. Oddly, East Fremantle has produced the most AFL premiership players of any club, an odd turnabout. In NSW, beyond the strong border regions, Sydney has become increasingly productive in producing AFL players, particularly in the north and east of the city. That speaks to the strength of the Swans Academy, which covers these parts of Sydney. The Riverina, just north of the Murray, has also produced more than its fair share of AFL stars, with Wayne Carey and Paul Kelly hailing from there. Further north, the Gold Coast produces the most professional footballers north of the Barassi Line, with a strong Victorian expat community and local footy scene. The Southport Sharks, in particular, have produced more players than any other local club in the draft era. Nick Riewoldt might be the most famous Southport product, but he's far from the only one. Brisbane's north has also been increasingly productive, with Lions Academy players like Harris Andrews and Eric Hipwood springing from the north of the river in recent years. In the Top End, most players end up coming to the AFL from Darwin. Of the 82 AFL players from the NT in the draft era, only 14 have come from outside Darwin, and the NTFL, directly before being drafted. That's despite the devotion to footy in central Australia, and the near year-round competition in some communities. Tasmania has been the home to footy legends over the years, with Hobart and the North West being the strongest breeding grounds of talent. On a club level, North Hobart and Glenorchy have produced the most Taswegian AFL players. There's also a select number of players that have made their way to the AFL from international locations. Ireland has produced 63 AFL players from 24 of the 32 Irish counties. In addition, six Americans and one Canadian (Mike Pyke) have spent time in the AFL. Pyke's flag with Sydney means that Canada has the highest ratio of AFL players to premierships of any country in the world. The current state of the league sees different parts of the country contributing to on-field production. Given Melbourne is home to nine of the league's clubs, it is unsurprising that players from the Victorian capital have produced about a third of the league's player output measured via Player Approximate Value, or PAV. In particular, Melbourne's eastern and southern suburbs, home to players such as Max Gawn, Jarryd Lyons and Jack Macrae, have been strong contributors of talent this year. Outside the major cities, Gippsland and Shepparton figure strongly, each contributing about the output of half a team each. Outside Victoria, players from the north of Perth and south-eastern South Australia are making a large impact this year. The strength of that part of SA is largely driven by 2020 Brownlow medallist and Kybybolite product Lachie Neale, alongside Jordan Dawson and Rhys Stanley. Looking a little deeper, a certain pattern emerges about what type of player comes from each different state. Using PAV, ABC Sport has broken down what type of contribution players from each state (and territory) have made this year — whether it is offensive, defensive or in the midfield. If Tasmania were to field a team full of homegrown talent, it would be hard to score against. A look at the defender-heavy list of Tasmanian players reveals why. ABC Sport calculates that the defensive contributions of the cohort far outweigh their exploits in other parts of the ground, with Jeremy Howe, Ryan Gardner, Jake Kolodjashnij and Alex Pearce hailing from the Apple Isle. By way of contrast, NSW-origin players have excelled most strongly up forward. A NSW state of origin team wouldn't lack for scoring power, including the likes of Hawkins, Isaac Heeney, Luke Breust and Taylor Walker. The ACT, led by midfield guns Jack Steele and Tom Green, have the highest proportion of midifield contribution.

35,Your team in two lines — the AFL at round eight,sport," Sport From Melbourne to West Coast — your AFL team's position summed up in two lines For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency We've completed a third of the AFL season, and already we are getting close to clean air between the top eight and the rest. But this season has already thrown up different challenges for different sides. Some are struggling to produce their best footy due to things not clicking, others have had big injuries, and others still have had their season upended by COVID. Elsewhere there are three teams at the top who are functioning quite fluently, including the one that is a game clear on the ladder. So how is YOUR team going after eight rounds? Let's take a look at all 18 sides in two lines each — and there's only one place to start. What can be said that hasn't already for the Demons — a 15-game winning streak, the best one-two midfield punch in the league with Clayton Oliver and Christian Petracca, a dynamic ruck pairing of Max Gawn and Luke Jackson, and the scary sense that there are more gears to come. Can they match the likes of Collingwood 2011 and St Kilda 2009 (20 wins in home and away) or even Geelong 2008 and Essendon 2000 (21 wins)? Perhaps — who's going to stop them? The Dockers have surprised just about everyone, and are flying thanks to the quarterbacking of Andrew Brayshaw, the rucking and scoring ability of Sean Darcy, the contested ball-getting of Will Brodie and the best defence in the AFL — and they haven't even had Nat Fyfe around yet. Justin Longmuir's men are primed for a huge run at the top four — and more — but they can't afford any momentum-dragging losses leading into the bye. The big plus for Brisbane in 2022 has been the balance — the Lions have always had an exciting attack, but having Dayne Zorko directing play off half-back has been a key switch early on. The biggest concern for Brisbane is whether Joe Daniher's shoulder can avoid another sub-lux when he returns — but with Lachie Neale back to his elite best and Hugh McCluggage adding crucial goals to his set-up skills, the Lions have a formidable set of attacking weapons, and a prelim looks like the starting point. For all the chat about new recruits like Adam Cerra and George Hewett, it's the full return of three existing players — Patrick Cripps, Charlie Curnow and Sam Docherty — that has been the big lift for the Blues in 2022. If the clearance game and delivery to Curnow and Harry McKay stays strong, the finals drought dating back to 2013 will finally be broken for the Blues. Spirits are high at Geelong after the demolition of the Giants, and the tandem of Jeremy Cameron and Tom Hawkins up forward is proving a stiff test for everyone — but it has been an up-and-down year for the Cats so far. Chris Scott and his team went back to basics to shut down GWS, but if the old, familiar grinding game style from previous years returns, then the old, familiar question will still be there later in the year — will it work in finals? The Swans' apparent upward trajectory has hit a couple of obstacles — the Lions result might have been expected but the loss to the Suns was not. The pieces are there for a proper run at the finals — when the Sydney attack is humming it is capable of overwhelming sides — but the Swans need to address the issues in stoppage clearances and contested possessions that have been visible particularly in the last fortnight. After eight rounds in 2021, St Kilda was 11th, with a percentage of 82.7 — a year on, the Saints are making strides with seventh spot on the ladder, one extra win and a percentage 35 higher. Despite losses to the Power and Demons, St Kilda are building nicely with the three Jacks — Higgins, Steele and Sinclair — and forward focal point Max King giving the Saints a strong hand in the race to make finals for what would be only the second time in 11 seasons. Tom Lynch is monstering defences, Dusty Martin is back on the park, and Maurice Rioli Jr's entree to AFL is both strengthening the Tigers' links with one of the great football dynasties and also fitting in with the kind of high-pressure, dynamic game that is Richmond at its best. So things are on the improve at Tigerland — but let’s wait for the three games either side of the bye (Sydney R11, Port Adelaide R13, Carlton R14) to get a sense of where this team is really at. The Craig McRae era has started well at Collingwood, with the team playing an attack-focused game that is pleasing to the eye and has got early wins on the scoreboard. The Magpies remain a work in progress, and medium- to long-term injuries to Brodie Grundy and Jamie Elliott aren't helping — but there's no disguising the excitement of talents like Nick Daicos and Jack Ginnivan, and even if finals might be a step too far for 2022, the future looks bright for the Pies. The Bulldogs in 2022 have been like a high-performance sports car with a misfiring engine — the absence of Josh Bruce has hurt up forward, skipper Marcus Bontempelli is struggling physically, the back six is being shredded with opposition marks inside 50, and the injury list has just had a few new entries, including forward Cody Weightman. We've had a few recent examples of grand finalists who miss finals the following year — Richmond 2021, GWS 2020, Adelaide 2018 — and there are big danger signs that Western Bulldogs might add to the list. When Ken Hinkley spoke to the media at 0-5 and said teams could lose five games in a row and still make finals, most people shook their heads. It's still an uphill task for the men from Alberton, but if results go on form, the Power could be back to 5-6 going into the bye — if they can keep improving their supply to Jeremy Finlayson and Todd Marshall up forward (and get Charlie Dixon back on the park) the season will start to look a lot brighter. The old saying ""a change is as good as a rest"" could be applied to Hawthorn this season under new coach Sam Mitchell. The Hawks have looked invigorated, and wins over Port Adelaide and Geelong — not to mention holding the Demons to a 10-point margin — showed positive signs. Some pieces of the puzzle — like Dylan Moore, Mitch Lewis and Jai Newcombe — appear to be in place, but a tough loss to the Bombers is a reminder of what stage the Hawks are at, and with Richmond, Brisbane and Fremantle up in the next five weeks, it's a difficult period ahead. A cursory glance at the ladder might suggest business as usual at Gold Coast, but they are playing better than results suggest with their more direct style — the excellent win over the Swans showed the season doesn't have to end for them after round four each year. The impact of Ben King's absence cannot be underestimated, but Levi Casboult is proving to be an inspired addition, Izak Rankine is beginning to hit form and while Jarrod Witts is tapping to Touk Miller, Noah Anderson and co, the Suns have more than a few winnable games on the way. This season has already seen a few revivals from teams, and Matthew Nicks' Crows are one of the surprise ones — already they have three exciting wins and a narrow round-one loss to the Dockers that looks better and better in hindsight. The longer things go, however, the more it seems they faced teams like the Tigers and Bulldogs at the right time — thumpings by GWS and Carlton suggest preseason predictions that had Adelaide finishing between 16th and 18th might be close to the mark. For GWS, this 2022 season is being overshadowed by the unanswered question of coach Leon Cameron's future — so far the team's travails point to his tenure ending after a decade. The Giants' average margin in their six losses is 39.5 points, and while Toby Greene's return from suspension has made a difference, scoring remains a struggle with a goals-to-inside-50 ratio of 1:5, when the top teams are 1:4. The win over Hawthorn may have given some hope to the Bombers after a tough start to 2022, and stories like Peter Wright (third in the Coleman medal) and mature-age sensation Nic Martin have been big positives for the club. A lot of questions remain, however, on the future of players like Dylan Shiel, on coach Ben Rutten, and whether a defence that is giving up an average of 102 points a game is capable of keeping them in the contest week in, week out. The next half-dozen games could be pivotal. Life has not been easy at Arden Street — 30 games into the rebuild, coach David Noble's record is five wins, one draw and 24 losses. This season, the Kangaroos' only win has been against the Eagles at the height of the COVID issues in the west — the last four weeks have seen losses of 68, 60, 50 and 80 points, and with Port Adelaide, Melbourne and St Kilda next up, it's hard to see things easing up soon. The injuries, the COVID avalanche, the nightclub outings, the declining leaders, the repeated need for top-up players, the stats that are down across the board — it's been a perfect storm for the Eagles this season. There are occasional positives, like Jeremy McGovern still picking off attacks in the backline and the thrill of watching Liam Ryan in action — but if you're averaging eight goals a game and conceding 16, the road back is a long and painful one.

36,"Resurgent, emergent Broncos rescue first night of Magic Round after abysmal opener",sport," Sport Brisbane Broncos continue return to form against Manly, after Magic Round gets off to rough start For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Organisers decided months ago what the first game of Magic Round would be. In some ways it's a prime slot — kicking off the most anticipated round since the opener — but it's also a graveyard slot — off free-to-air telly and starting as people get home from work or cook dinner. It was also only ever going to be a curtain-raiser to the main event, Brisbane vs Manly. With Newcastle dropping just below Canterbury to 16th on the ladder last week, it ensured the graveyard slot would be occupied by two teams effectively dead on arrival. The NRL got lucky. The people who turned up at 6pm on a Friday, less so. While the Bulldogs seem spurred on by years of futile toil at the bottom of the ladder, energised by new faces and excited by the very prospect of building towards something, Newcastle appear shellshocked to find themselves where they are. Their attack lacks spark, even with Kalyn Ponga at the back, although he looks more static than electric right now. They managed to trip over the finish line first — 16-6 — but even Knights coach Adam O'Brien couldn't watch at one point, storming out of the box when Leo Thompson dropped the ball from here. Mercifully for Thompson and fittingly for the match, the Bulldogs went up the other end and Chris Patolo also dropped the ball cold. Both mentors could have been forgiven for feigning health and safety protocols to get out of dodge, because there were any number of similar passages of play where the teams looked rudderless. At the end of an energetic, if flawed, opening stanza, on the last play of the first half, Edrick Lee moved almost 20 metres in-field to slide out wide on a left-side shift. He got a wide ball from Kalyn Ponga and was met, by not just opposite number Jayden Okunbor, but Brent Naden. Then Kyle Flanagan. Then Tevita Pangai Jr. The Bulldogs' sliding defence matched the lateral attack so easily that it must have stunned the Bulldogs that the Knights were making it that easy. The set before that, the ball went to ground between Lee and Bradman Best on a similarly ineffective slide. The play after that, Tex Hoy kicked dead on the full and crocked his shoulder. Starting from 20 metres out with seven tackles under their belt, the Bulldogs replied by failing to run at the one-armed man defending at a narrow right centre, then knocked it on before reaching the third tackle. In the second half, Newcastle strung together enough competent seconds for Ponga to put Bradman Best past some ordinary Bulldogs defence. But, true to form, the Knights knocked on off the ensuing set. Continuing the theme, the Bulldogs failed to pack the scrum in time but were still allowed to play on, only to watch fullback Matt Dufty drop the ball on the scrumbase play. It was a miracle Peter V'landys didn't get on the blower before full-time and change the rules to make this win only worth one point, but by the time it was over and the Lang Park light show started, it was clear that wasn't Magic Round's opening act; just the support act. Before the 16-team, eight-game festival of footy was official, Manly had a habit of taking the occasional home game up to Brisbane. That was evident in the support they got from the Lang Park crowd on Friday night, paired with a few refrains of Eagle Rock and coupled with some Brookvale-level booing of Adam Reynolds every time he lined up a shot at goal. The bad news for those booing was that Reynolds was lining them up a lot. Seven times to be exact. And all of them went through — the only blemish being a wayward field-goal attempt late in the first half. For the second week in a row, Reynolds played conductor, with Selwyn Cobbo and Corey Oates first and second chair violins, and Payne Haas and Pat Carrigan setting the tempo in the percussion section as the Broncos trampled their opponents. Last week it was reigning grand finalists South Sydney, this week it was a Manly side with superstar Tom Trbojevic featuring in his second game back from injury. But the gun fullback featured in the opening blunder of the game, allowing the kick-off to bounce between himself and Kieran Foran, rolling dead and handing possession back to the Broncos. Reynolds and Cobbo combined for the first time, soon after, and Brisbane — 14th last year and stone-dead last in 2020 — were off and running. Freak starts like that have happened to Brisbane over the past two years, but they've almost always let them slip with silly mistakes, lazy defence and bad execution. This time they never looked like slowing down. Trbojevic was clearly labouring at the back and couldn't impact the game, but you got the sense even at the peak of his powers, the end result would have been the same (though maybe not as emphatic as the 38-0 scoreline that eventuated). The aforementioned stars were of course excellent, as were Kurt Capewell, Kotoni Staggs and Herbie Farnworth. Crucially, Billy Walters is hitting his stride, in this case meaning passes from dummy half are finally hitting Reynolds in stride, starting Brisbane's attack off on the right note more often than not. Even the rain that has battered Brisbane for two weeks straight held off for most of the night, only really returning for the final 25 minutes to ensure Oates could have a fun slip and slide as he dove in for his double. On a night when four NRL teams took to the park, the Broncos looked by far the most competent, complete and copacetic of the lot. After watching them the past two years, if that's not enough to make you believe in magic, what is?

37,"Broncos run riot in Magic Round, thumping the abject Sea Eagles 38-0",sport," Sport Brisbane Broncos beat Manly Sea Eagles 38-0 on opening night of NRL Magic Round For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Adam Reynolds has channelled Allan Langer as Brisbane turned back the clock with a historic 38-0 thrashing of Manly. Exactly one year ago Reynolds arrived in Brisbane for the NRL's Magic Round with South Sydney, almost miserably explaining why he had chosen the long-term security of the Broncos over a one-year extension at his childhood club. On Friday any misery was a distant memory, the captain as delighted as the 40,267-strong Magic Round crowd as he orchestrated a romp that included a Selwyn Cobbo hat-trick. Corey Oates also scored twice in the Broncos' fourth-straight win, something that's alluded them since 2017, and confirms Kevin Walters' improving side's position in the top eight. Victory follows wins over top-four side Cronulla and last year's finalists Souths, with a top-four position now in their sights ahead of games against Newcastle (13th), Gold Coast (15th) and Canberra (12th). It also came a year after the Broncos' biggest ever loss to Manly, the 50-6 drubbing a marker of how far the 2020 wooden spooners have come in 12 months. Prized recruit Reynolds was in the middle of it, twice putting in pinpoint cross-field kicks for Cobbo, while the 19-year-old winger also reeled in an intercept and raced 95 metres for his third try. The halfback also looked after himself, collecting his own Langer-like short chip and scooting over to cap a brilliant first half. The writing was on the wall from the kick-off for Manly, who allowed the ball to bounce 15 metres over the dead ball line. Brisbane collected the short re-start and Reynolds obliged when Reuben Garrick strayed off his wing, kicking for Cobbo's first. Possession swung heavily in Brisbane's favour but their improved defence was up to task when necessary, Billy Walters somehow holding out Tom Trbojevic after he had caught a bomb and landed on the tryline. Their attack was otherwise clunky, Trbojevic managing soreness in his well-strapped knee and brother Ben suffering a shoulder injury. Oates' second try, cutting back through some soft defence, sealed Brisbane's biggest-ever win over the Sea Eagles. But with two Kurt Capwell's efforts denied on review, the second a line-ball forward pass, the damage could have been worse. Brisbane's forwards were also dominant, with Pat Carrigan (156m) one of five Brisbane forwards with 100-plus run metres. AAP The Newcastle Knights climbed off the bottom of the ladder, beating Canterbury 16-6 in an underwhelming opening act at Lang Park. The Knights and Bulldogs acted their ranks (16th and 15th respectively) as they fumbled their way through 80 minutes of NRL football. The Bulldogs, having only last week been usurped by Newcastle for 16th spot on the ladder, went straight back down there thanks to 13 errors with the ball and more than twice as many missed tackles without it, according to Stats Perform. Despite the win, coach Adam O'Brien, who stormed out of the box after lock Leo Thompson bombed a second-half try, will be none too pleased by how close the game was. His team had 57 per cent of the ball, dominated the offload count 9-1 and broke twice as many tackles as their opponent. Edrick Lee scored first for the Knights off a questionable pass from centre Bradman Best, before Josh Addo-Carr answered back for the Dogs. With the teams locked at 6-6 at half-time, it took only seven minutes for Best to break the deadlock after fullback Kalyn Ponga scooted past an over-committed Bulldogs defender. It was a rare highlight on a down night for the out-of-form Knight custodian. Newcastle were awarded two more tries, only for the bunker to overrule, but the video referee could not deny Adam Clune's solo game-breaker with five minutes left in the game.

38,The life and death of City v Country — how the legacy of league's much loved rep game lives on,sport,"  Campo's Corner: The life and death of City v Country — how the legacy of league's much loved rep game lives on For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tariq Sims did the same thing every single year. He'd mark out his goals for the season to come, and he'd always aim high – premiership wins, New South Wales Origin jerseys, all the dreams you can imagine. But before he could do any of that, something else had to come first. Because before Sims was a Blue, before he was a Dragon or a Knight or a Cowboy, before he was anything else in football, he was a Gerringong Lion. He was from the country, and that meant a lot. So Sims turned up, again and again, for Country Origin in their annual clash with City. From 2012, when he debuted, until 2017, when the game finally faded away, he was there. Towards the end, plenty of NRL players pulled out, either through their own volition or after pressure from their clubs, who feared injuries for their stars and in the end caused the death of this match that was once a staple of the rugby league calendar. But Sims never did. Not ever. He finished with six caps for Country Origin, one short of Laurie Daley's record of seven, and he's as proud of that as he is anything he has done in rugby league. ""Going away for the week, immersing yourself in the history of the jersey and giving back to the country, representing the people from the bush, there was nothing like it,"" Sims says. ""Pulling on that maroon jersey with the gold V, that was so special to me. It was a stepping-stone to Origin, a chance to prove yourself, and playing against other New South Welshmen in the City team, personally it felt like one of the real rivalries. ""Once you're committed you have to give it your all. That's the bush mentality, you can't do things half-arsed, you have to go out there and have a go. ""We played with our heart on our sleeve, and we wanted to play tough, we wanted to be a team the country could be proud of."" First played in 1911, by the end of City-Country's long life span it was regarded as a remnant of a world which no longer existed, a holdover from a different era of rugby league, when country footy and the Sydney competition were of truly comparable quality and somebody could still earn state or national selection by playing anywhere in New South Wales. The slow decline of the country competitions and the gradual rise of the Sydney premiership into the NRL we know today, meant City-Country became something else — a trial for a New South Wales Origin berth and an opportunity to represent one's hometown or suburb on a big stage. Then slowly, bit by agonising bit, this game was chipped away until, five years ago, it was ended as a top-line match. Rugby league hasn't been the same since, because the secret truth of City-Country was that it was always more than it was said to be — it wasn't just a selection trial, or a game on a Sunday afternoon, it was a celebration of some of the game's most unheralded heroes, a week of recognition for parts of this sport that are so often overlooked. Like the pre-season All Stars game, the match itself was as much a culmination as it was a showpiece. Winning the game mattered, and playing well mattered, but the community work during the week, inspiring the next generation and connecting with the people who keep the game alive in the bush, was just as crucial. That's why it still had meaning to the end, even if the stars didn't come out for it like they once did and it was easy to sneer at a game that had, to many, lost a lot of cachet. But when you were in town when City-Country was on and you could see what it meant in person, then the value of the game was easy to understand. Plenty of the game's critics wouldn't take that trip over the mountains or up or down the coast or into the west. You don't need to be from the country to understand what the jersey meant, you just have to be from somewhere and be proud of it. ""I always pride myself on how I represent where I'm from, my family, my junior team, my mates. To pull that jersey on, it really does mean something to you, and it gives hope to kids from the bush when they see you wear it,"" Sims says. ""It's not that often that NRL teams play in the bush, for kids to see a game live was a big deal to them. Inspiring the next generation of kids coming through, that played a big part in what you were trying to represent. ""Maybe we went to their school, or they came to the game and met a player afterwards, and maybe that's what inspired them to chase their dream. That was something that always stood out to me."" The NRL has compensated for the loss of City-Country by playing more games in regional areas, which are, in their own right, important to keeping the game alive in country New South Wales. But there's a difference between having a game in one town and having a team playing for the entire bush. A single game can only be played in one place at a time, but a rep team is different – it's right there in the name. They represent something much larger than just one place. It doesn't just inspire kids, it lifts up everyone around the game. Sims could always feel that through his long career for Country, no matter if the game was played in Mudgee, Coffs Harbour, Dubbo or Wagga Wagga. That's the thing about the country – some things are the same wherever you go. ""You don't go in the sheds after the game, you stay on the field and the fans come to you, and it just has that nice country vibe, which I've always really enjoyed,"" Sims says. ""I'm sure it was the same for the City boys when they talked to kids who wanted to be where they were. Out in the country we'd see people who would drive three or four hours just to watch us train. ""It was a big deal to them, and it was a big deal for us to play for them. The people in the bush don't get seen or heard as often as they should, so to go out there and make them proud, it meant a lot to me."" It still does. Sims is 32 and much closer to the end of his career than the start, but if he had the chance he'd pull the Country jersey on without question, so long as they'd have him. ""I'd absolutely play if they still had it. If there was a chance to represent the country it would always be a goal. If the coach picked me I'd be frothing,"" Sims says. ""Being able to represent the bush is always a big deal, and there's a lot of pride there. ""I think if you asked a lot of the Country guys they'd say the same thing – that they have a responsibility to inspire the next generation."" But Sims will never get that chance in the same way again. Neither will the players who come after him. As a top-level match, City-Country is long gone. It wasn't a sudden death. It took years, and it died a little bit at a time via a series of small cuts that added up in the end. A break can be mended, but disintegration cannot. A rope which has been cut can be tied back together, but it cannot be fixed if it's been allowed to rot away. Clubs and coaches stopped allowing their charges to play, citing the risk of injury, which impacted the star power of the game which, in turn, led many to challenge the relevance of the concept in modern age. The catchcry was that the game was no longer a genuine Origin trial, and thus it was considered pointless. But the true benefits were not in dollars and cents, or in giving the Blues coach a form guide, but in hearts and minds that were won and recognised, and in the future the game could inspire. Given we live in a cold world of balance sheets and bottom lines, that was never going to be enough. The game could not be saved in the end, so when it was consigned to the history books at the end of 2017 it was for the best and worst of reasons. Even though rugby league is a sport obsessed with nostalgia, to the point where it can occasionally consume the game and blind it to a better future, that nostalgia does not always seem to apply equally. Every few months there's a story about how bush footy is on it's knees, how it's withering on the vine and being forgotten. You can set your watch to them arriving. There's a lot of truth in most of them, because money is tight and a lot of country towns are declining and it's harder to put a team together than it used to be. Having a week of celebration and recognition, which showed the country was important to rugby league, and the people there did matter, and the millionaires in the ivory towers hadn't forgotten about them and what they did for the game, meant something. The match mattered, and so did everything around it. It was further proof that rugby league as a sport can be so much larger than just the 16 clubs that make up the NRL as the size and scale of the elite competition and the Origin series and the money they generate threaten to swallow up the nooks and crannies that make a sport larger than a single league. Representative football gives rugby league a different flavour, one people always seem to enjoy if they're just given a chance to enjoy it. For proof, look no further than international football, which came so far in the years leading up to COVID before the pandemic slammed the breaks on Test matches. It is only now those types of matches are getting off the ground again, and even then with plenty of resistance from the clubs. Their fear of injury or player burnout is understandable, and clubs looking after their own interests is to be expected, but the game has the potential to be so much larger than 16 teams. City-Country was beyond saving by the end. It's passing was assured many years before the plug was finally pulled. It's easy to consign it to the other novelties of league's past that were left behind when the time came for it, like the Amco Cup or contested scrums. But instead of being a curio or a novelty for the rugby league trainspotter, the end City-Country should instead serve as a warning. This was a game played since 1911, and it meant so much to so many, but if it can be allowed to die then almost can anything can be killed. Selling the country part of City-Country has always been easy. Giving good old boys from the bush a chance to represent the small towns that made them, make their families and communities proud and giving a day in the sun to a part of rugby league so rarely afforded that type of recognition – who could possibly object to it? For City, the equation isn't so simple. Country fellas, for the most part, can find a lot of common ground regardless if they come from Cobar or Forster or anywhere in-between but Sydney, with it's vast sprawl, is harder to get a handle on, especially when it comes to rugby league given the sport was built on tribalism between the different suburbs. Being a country boy can be a way of life, but there's no song called 'Thank God I'm a City Slicker'. Enter Brad Fittler, who became City-Country's great champion in it's final, difficult years. Fittler took over as City coach in 2011 and stayed in charge until the match was wound up at the end of 2017. A seven-time City rep as a player, the match was always important to Fittler. ""It was a game I grew up watching, a game I grew up playing when it was a trial match for Origin. It was always my first step into the next level,"" Fittler says. ""One thing I was very aware of when I got into coaching was the workload on players. I always tried to choose players I thought would benefit from a week in camp, and I thought that worked really well. ""You try to use it as a time to revitalise a career, or give a young bloke a go or give a fella who might be on the way out one last week in camp. I saw a lot of different benefits of the game over different times. ""It was something I always enjoyed, and I enjoyed getting out to the country. I loved getting out there, talking to the people, and I got a real joy in beating them as well."" As NRL stars fell away from the fixture, Fittler never stopped treating the game with the utmost respect. It was a week to be enjoyed, but there was always a game to be won and a jersey to be honoured. ""I remember one day I was calling on the forwards, calling them cats and taking the ball up to them,"" Fittler says. ""When you have (assistant coach) Tony Butterfield next to you and he's five years older and still taking it up you think 'I can't let him do it on his own'. Hanging around Tony Butterfield for a week is always a fun thing to do, he's a good man and very passionate. ""It must have fired them up, because Mitch Allgood, who played for us that year, sat me on my arse. It's a good memory. ""You have to hand it to the players. The prestige didn't run with it like it once did, but they saw how serious I was about the game, and there was always a reason to do it well rather than neglect it and just treat it like another game of footy."" Fittler found small ways to build a bond in the short camp. He would call in fellow City alumni from his playing days and have them speak about the pride of the jersey, how it felt to have become a City man, and how far a good performance could take them. He would take his players into the heart of Sydney, to somewhere like the Hope Street Hostel, and have them cook dinner for those less fortunate. At junior clinics he would send them on to the field with the words ""go out there and change a child's life"". ""One thing I always tried to teach them was the demographics of the city, what happens in there, the good and the bad of the city, and a bit of the history. Just little touches along the way,"" Fittler says. ""We had a great reaction to that, some of my greatest times were coaching City teams, it was always a lot of fun because it was light but they knew there would be rewards for good games, for excellence. ""A lot of players bought in, which surprised me. A lot of coaches didn't buy in, and that didn't surprise me, because I'd been a coach and I'd see that side of it. ""I always tried to be selective, I'd speak to coaches, some pulled players out while others allowed players to come in. It was a tricky one, but I'd like to think we got it right more than we didn't."" The records show Fittler did more than just that. He won three, drew one and lost two of his six matches in charge for City, a remarkable record given he was almost always coaching a heavy underdog. One year he picked Addin Fonua-Blake, only for the NSWRL to rule he was ineligible. Another time he picked a young James Tedesco, who had played just four NRL matches at the time. A couple of years later he picked Ryan Matterson, who'd only played two. Eight other players in the side that year had appeared in less than 40 NRL games. They played against a Country team that boasted Jack Wighton, Isaah Yeo, James Maloney, Jack Bird, Jack de Belin, Tyson Frizell, Boyd Cordner and Dale Finucane, and the City boys won, handily, with guys like Kyle Lovett and Aaron Gray playing blinders in a 44-30 win. But even that couldn't compare to the chaos of the final game in 2017. Things were already looking dicey when Paul Gallen was asked to return from representative retirement for one last ride, to hopefully inspire some players to stick it out. Ten minutes before the side was to be named, a press release was issued saying the announcement would be delayed because City didn't have the numbers. Calls were made across the league for somebody, anybody who grew up in Sydney and wanted to be part of something, to come on down. One of the calls reached Phil Gould at Penrith, who had coached Fittler for club, City and state in the past, and he had the guys for the job. ""I rocked up to Panthers training and the coach called me into his office and asked if I wanted to play for City, and I jumped at it. We all came in midweek, Gal was already there and I joined the group and being part of a side coached by Freddy, that was pretty special,"" then Penrith prop James Tamou says. ""Rep footy is about coming together, and that's hard to do on short notice. It's hard to build connections and trust and everything else in a few days. ""Freddy was big on making those connections. The forwards all went for early morning walks together, for example, and we didn't have to talk about footy, we just had to be together. ""You can't train much, but building those connections is more important and Freddy understands that, that was the secret sauce that brought everyone together."" Even with the addition of Panthers stars Tamou, Matt Moylan, Nathan Cleary, Bryce Cartwright and Tyrone Peachey, City had to dig deep into the bullpen to find a 17 to take on the old rivals one last time. Dragons forward Hame Sele, who had come off the bench in each of his four NRL appearances, started at lock. Two of the subs, Jake Marketo and Pauli Pauli, were picked from reserve grade. Neither man had played a first grade game all year, and between the two of them they would only ever play one more in their careers. But it didn't matter. They were City men, and they were willing and that's all Fittler needed. It wasn't about how good he made them, it's how he made them good. Tamou, in his first and only match for City, played one of the games of his life, Gallen rolled back the years in what proved to be the final rep game he ever played and managed came together in what remains one of the great feats of Fittler's coaching career to down a far more star-studded Country side 20-10 and win eternal bragging rights, because what's already happened can't ever change. ""They were favourites, because our team came together so late, we were almost like a group of bandits that got thrown together and rolled into town. But everyone who put their hand up did a job,"" Tamou says. ""It all came together for us, it all came out that day in Mudgee. ""At that point in time I'd played for Australia and New South Wales, but you never want to stop playing rep footy. If someone rings you up and asks if you want to play City-Country you should say yes straight away. ""It wasn't just a trial match for Origin, it was a rep game on it's own. The passion that comes into it, it's a dream come true for those country blokes and for us as well. It's always been that battle. ""You go to any country town, they want to tear your head off cause you're a city boy. That battle has always been there. It was sad to see it go, but it's a jersey I'll treasure."" Long after the annual conversations of City-Country being a genuine State of Origin trial have ceased, its impact is still being felt in the game's harshest arena. Of the 64 players who debuted for New South Wales between 2010 and 2020, 56 of them played City-Country. Even that last day in Mudgee proved to be a hotbed of future Blues stars despite so many withdrawals as 11 players, including Sims, Cleary, Damien Cook, Josh Addo-Carr, Cody Walker and Dale Finucane, went on to play for New South Wales in the years since ""Even though we're playing against other New South Welshmen we all did the same moves and same plays so once we did get into Origin it was seamless,"" says Sims, who made his Origin debut the year after City-Country wrapped up and has gone on to appear five times for the Blues under Fittler. ""There was no gelling period, we just jumped straight in. We already knew what was needed, we knew what was required to perform at that level. ""It's a great stepping stone to that level."" But City-Country was more than the making of the players – it was the making of Fittler as a coach. Given Fittler now has the same win percentage in charge of the Blues as Gould, it's easy to forget his stock as a coach was not high when he took over City ten years ago. His time in charge of the Roosters was tumultuous and inconsistent, and by his own admission he was far from the coach he would become. But plenty of the hallmarks that have helped him become one of the state's most decorated coaches were honed during his time with City. All the Fittler trademarks – like forcing players to bond by asking them to stay off their phones, forging strong links to the community to give the people they're representing a human face, giving players the support to play their natural game and the confidence to execute it under pressure – aren't just inventions he cooked up once he took the big job. Before Fittler asked his Blues players to go to a corner of Lang Park or Stadium Australia and think about every person who got them where they are today, the people they were playing for once they got out there, he asked his City players to do the same at the Glen Willow Sportsground in Mudgee. ""A lot of times our team maybe wasn't as strong as theirs, but we were always very competitive and it gave me confidence that it works, the stuff I did worked,"" Fittler says. ""If the players wanted to have a go, they could have a go. It gave me confidence. ""Speaking to Paul Gallen, after the game he played at the end, I think he surprised himself with how much he enjoyed it. ""In a lot of the camps we had a lot of fun. It was almost the last of the camps where you could have a good night out like it used to be."" While Fittler holds many fond memories of City-Country, and was the game's greatest advocate during it's last days, he knows it won't ever return in it's old form. ""I'm nearly on the other side now. I understood towards the end, how delicate it is with players, but we never had many injuries, I think Matt Moylan broke his thumb one year but that's about it,"" Fittler says. ""I was always grateful we got through it unscathed, because there's a big workload on the players."" It is how it is, Fittler says, and besides – the game isn't dead. Not all the way, anyway. ""They run it in the juniors now, my young bloke is playing in the City 16s this weekend,"" he says. ""It still has a purpose."" Zach Fittler will indeed emulate his father and wear the blue and gold of City this Saturday at Brookvale Oval. The Under 16s clash is part of the revamped City-Country weekend, which the NSWRL introduced last year. The NRL players won't be there, even if they wished they could be, because the NRL is holding it's Magic Round on the same weekend. But there will be more maroon and gold and blue and yellow than you could ever ask for with Under 16s, boys and girls Under 18s, men's and women's police, physical disability and wheelchair matches to be played, as well as men's and women's opens games. The women's game will have some of the NRLW's biggest stars, because it is still a true fight for Blues spots, but the men's game won't quite have the same shine. City will be represented by the best of the Ron Massey Cup, which sits a tier below reserve grade, while Country is made up of players from all over the bush. It's back to the old ways, residential rules, and the passion is still there. ""People might belittle you and say it's not an Origin trial,"" says Hamish Oxley, who played for Country in 2021. ""But getting to wear that jersey was the proudest thing I've ever done in football. I understand it's not an Origin trial or anything like that, and I don't want to sound like a flog, but it makes you feel on top of the world."" Oxley, who plies his trade for Oakdale Workers in the Macarthur Rugby League competition, is a self-described bush footy battler. Last year's Country team, which was thrown together with players from all over the state, was filled with guys just like him. ""I was the only player from my comp who got picked, I roomed with a guy from Cooma, the team was from everywhere but because we're all country guys we have a lot in common. Plenty of them let go of the NRL dream when they were 18 or 19, but they're still weapon footy players,"" Oxley says. ""The whole thing had this real professional feel, we were in camp for seven days and it was one of the best weeks of my life. I was 29, but it makes you feel like a kid, you feel like you've made it. ""You go into a room and see Terry Campese standing there with Beau Scott, two guys who are legends and played for Country. ""They coached the side for free, and they gave us a spiel when we first came into camp that those weeks they spent with the Country side were some of the best weeks of their careers, and they just wanted to give back to country footy. ""They still felt like they owed country footy something. There was a lot of pride."" City got the job done against the bush boys in their meeting last year. It was a bit of a belting as well, with the pride of Sydney running out 38-12 winners. But for proof it wasn't just a week on the piss and a bit of a run around, look no further than the man of the match that day – Soni Luke. Luke has since earned his belated NRL debut with the Panthers. He's living proof City-Country can still be a step towards something greater, even if it's not a sky blue jersey. Penrith's Soni Luke rise from park footy to the NRL is an overnight success story years in the making. ""It was a great experience. It was a great stepping stone for me, I got a lot of recognition for it. I still think there's room in the game for it,"" Luke says. ""I got to represent my junior club, St Mary's, and they were wrapped for us. It was so good, I'm really lucky."" Still, things aren't the same as they used to be. There's no more travelling roadshow out to some small country town where the players are welcomed like conquering heroes. Fans don't drive hours just to watch them train anymore. Blues Origin jerseys aren't on the line, and there's no more guns in the valley. But it's still City and it's still Country. The colours are still the same. There is still a clear line that is over a hundred years long which begins all the way back in 1911, and the jersey which was worn by Dally Messenger and Dave Brown, by Clive Churchill and Arthur Beetson, by just about every New South Wales legend who ever played this sport, is still worn today. And so long as the good Lord's willing and the creek don't rise, it'll continue to be worn into the future. The game won't ever be like it once was, but it's still something. The players who head out there over the weekend are the inheritors of all that history and pride and tradition. They're the ones who keep the flame burning, because it lives in them now, as it lived in so many legends before them. ""Growing up I idolised David Peachey, adored the bloke, and this was the game he made his own, he only played one Origin but he played for Country and dominated. I have that link with him now,"" Oxley says. ""I didn't score a try, but I kicked a couple of goals. I walked away from the ground thinking 'f**k, I scored points for country' and even though we lost it put the biggest smile on my face. ""I'm a part of Country history. I'm in the scorebook with some of my heroes. It's surreal.""

39,Rabbitohs lock Cameron Murray in doubt for Origin I after neck injury,sport,"  South Sydney lock Cameron Murray racing the clock to play in State of Origin I after neck injury For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency South Sydney are sweating on scans of a neck injury to Cameron Murray after the Rabbitohs captain was not named in Jason Demetriou's squad for their round-10 NRL clash with the Warriors. Murray's status was not included in a club medical update released on Tuesday, but the no-nonsense lock is likely to miss the next month of action. It leaves the 24-year-old racing the clock to be fit for the first State of Origin game on June 8. After the Warriors game at Magic Round, Souths face Canberra, the Wests Tigers and have been given a bye before Origin I. Cody Walker has been named captain, while Jai Arrow will play lock against the Warriors. NSW teammate Brian To'o told reporters at Penrith training on Tuesday that Murray's absence from Brad Fittler's side would be sizeable. ""He's obviously been one of the best Blues players, [he is] very consistent even with the Bunnies,"" To'o said. ""He always leads by example and works hard for the boys and he always puts the boys first."" Meanwhile, Canberra have breathed a sigh of relief after skipper Jarrod Croker was cleared of a major shoulder injury. Croker returned to NRL action in Friday's 14-4 victory over Canterbury after off-season stem cell surgery on his knee, but was forced off in the second half while trying to prevent a try. The 31-year-old has been cleared of any serious injury to his shoulder, with the Raiders confident the centre will miss just the next two to three weeks.

40,Australia to host 2027 men's and 2029 women's Rugby World Cups,sport," Sport Australia confirmed as host of the men's 2027 and women's 2029 Rugby World Cups For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian Rugby has been given a huge boost by World Rugby, being named as host of the 2027 men's and 2029 women's Rugby World Cup tournaments. World Rugby confirmed the decision at a council meeting in Dublin on Thursday. ""This is an historic day for rugby in Australia,"" Rugby Australia Chairman Hamish McLennan said. ""We're beyond thrilled to be welcoming not one, but two Rugby World Cups to our shores."" Australia, two-time winners of the men's World Cup in 1991 and 1999, had previously been named as the preferred candidate to host both tournaments. It last hosted the men's World Cup in 2003, losing to England curtesy of an extra time Jonny Wilkinson drop goal in a dramatic Sydney final. None of the previous nine editions of the women's version of the tournament have been held in Australia. Rugby Australia estimates that hosting the back-to-back tournaments will provide a $1.8 billion injection into the local economy. Confirmation of the awarding of the World Cups will be a welcome boost to Rugby Australia, which has struggled financially in recent years. Rugby Australia needed a $14 million loan from World Rugby last year after pre-existing financial issues spiralled into a full-blown crisis because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rugby Australia terminated more than 40 per cent of staff at the start of the pandemic in 2020 — the culmination of a horror period in which former chief executive Raelene Castle left the organisation, it paid an out-of-court settlement to Israel Folau, and it faced a declining supporter base and allegations of mismanagement from former players. But with interest gathered from World Cups in 2027 and 2029, the Commonwealth Games in 2026 and the Brisbane Olympics in 2032, plus the financial windfall of a British and Irish Lions tour in 2025, Rugby Australia has the chance to recapture the imagination of the sporting public. ""Today is a significant moment in time for our game,"" McLennan said. ""It's a game-changer for rugby in this country, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalise and secure the future of the sport here and see the game we all love grow and thrive for years to come. ""We look forward to working together with World Rugby, our member unions and government partners over the coming years to ensure that we make the most of this opportunity and continue the resurgence of rugby in this country."" Two-time World Cup winning Wallaby Tim Horan wrote on social media that being awarded the two tournaments is ""the most significant moment in Australia rugby's history, since winning RWC 1991."". ""Hosting men's 2027 and women's 2029 RWC will grow participation and provide financial security for our game for generations,"" he wrote. World Rugby also confirmed that the men's and women's Rugby World Cups would head to the USA for the first time in 2031 and 2033 respectively. The USA will be just the second tier-two nation to host the men's global showpiece, after Japan in 2019. ""I speak for the rugby community and fans across the United States when I express our sincere gratitude to World Rugby for their trust and endorsement of our vision to grow this incredible sport exponentially across our country,"" USA Rugby boss Ross Young said. ""USA Rugby will now venture into a new era and ensure the sport's most treasured event is a springboard for creating lasting, sustainable enthusiasm and passion for rugby from coast to coast."" The USA won the first women's World Cup in 1991 and were beaten finalists in the next two competitions although their men have never reached the quarter finals. It was also confirmed that England will host the 2025 women's World Cup as World Rugby set its agenda for the next decade. World Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said the announcement provided ""unprecedented certainty and an unparalleled opportunity to accelerate the growth and impact of rugby globally"".

41,Wallaroos defeat Fiji after 956-day Test drought,sport," Sport Australia's Wallaroos defeat Fiji 36-19 in long-awaited rugby Test in Brisbane For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Wallaroos have celebrated ending their 956-day Test match drought with an impressive 36-19 defeat of Fiji in Brisbane. Denied a chance to play a Test since 2019 because of COVID-19, the Wallaroos channelled the emotion of an inspiring and tearful rendition of the national anthem in a clinical performance at Lang Park. They were pushed by the dangerous Fijians, who boasted a host of talent from Fijiana Drua that recently romped undefeated to the Super W title in their maiden season. In just their first season in the competition, Fijiana Drua cap off an unbeaten campaign with a 32-26 victory over the reigning champions in the final in Melbourne. Up by seven points with 20 minutes to play, Wallaroos captain Shannon Parry boldly opted to kick for touch rather than go for a penalty-goal attempt. It paid off, with a clinical maul from the lineout helping hooker Ashley Marsters score a crucial try. The result is a boost for the Wallaroos, who will face Japan on Tuesday on the Gold Coast, ahead of the World Cup in New Zealand in October. The Wallaroos' backline did the early damage, with centre Pauline Piliae claiming player-of-the-match honours. Winger Mahalia Murphy and pocket rocket winger Ivania Wong were also impressive. Piliae scored one try and and set two up two more, while Murphy also crossed for a five-pointer. Veteran prop Liz Patu, in her 24th Test, bagged a try in another impressive shift. Fijiana hooker Vika Matarugu scored two close-range tries in the first half, while Talei Wilson kept the visitors in the contest with a try after sustained pressure in the second term. But the Wallaroos, anchored by backrower Parry, contained Fijiana's dangerous backline to stave off any signs of a comeback. Parry then iced the contest with a try of her own, plucking a pass from Georgie Friedrichs's line-break.

42,Australian Super Rugby sides had their best weekend against New Zealand opposition in a long time. Now they have to do it again,sport," Sport Australian rugby had its best week against New Zealand in years. Now they have to do it all again For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency By any way you choose to frame it, last weekend was a good one for Australian rugby teams over New Zealand opponents. Australian sides won three of the five games against New Zealand sides in Round 11, eclipsing in one weekend the entire haul of wins across the 25 games played in Super Rugby trans-Tasman last year. The Fijian Drua, playing their first ever Super Rugby match on Fijian soil were only three points off beating the Highlanders and making four losses for NZ in a single round. You'd need to turn more than a few pages of the history books to find the last time that happened. And then, the cherry on top, the Australian Women's Sevens side claimed the gold medal in the Langford, Canada leg of the Sevens World Series, beating the Black Ferns 21-17 in the Final and wrapping up the 2022 title with one round to play. Rob Valetini's moment of magic helps the Brumbies down the Hurricanes in Canberra, making it three wins from eight for Australian sides over their Kiwi brethren to open the trans-Tasman phase of Super Rugby Pacific. But on the Super Rugby front this coming weekend, we can be assured of one thing: the Kiwis will be back. And the Australian sides wouldn't be game to underestimate the bounce-back factor that is absolutely coming in Round 12 this weekend. The Crusaders were surprisingly lacklustre in their 24-21 loss to the Waratahs at Leichhardt Oval in Sydney, with coach Scott Robertson promising post-match to review everything as they tried to work out why New South Wales were able to jump out to a completely dominant – and thoroughly deserved – 17-0 half-time lead. ""We're looking for the answers ourselves, to be fair,"" Robertson answered when asked what went wrong. ""A lot of simple stuff we pride ourselves on, we didn't get right. ""In the last 20, we got plenty of opportunities and still didn't finish."" Speaking from Christchurch this week, scrumhalf Bryn Hall spoke of a brutally honest review that highlighted unforced mistakes, poor discipline, a misfiring lineout, and 23 missed tackles for the match. ""They're fair comments. If you look at that first 20-30 minutes, you can't really question it,"" he said, asked if post-match comments about the Waratahs 'wanting it more' was accurate of their performance. ""Look, we're going to lose games, we've lost games in the past, but when you question around our start and were we really there, and having those kind of questions … it hurts as a player. ""I think for us, it's the kind of traits that we live by that we weren't living up to. That's probably the most thing that hurt."" It's a clear message for the Western Force, who host the Crusaders in Perth on Saturday night. They won't be fooled into taking Australian teams lightly again. The NSW Waratahs have won their first game against a New Zealand side in three years, with an epic victory over the Crusaders. And it's fair to say the Australian teams know what's coming this weekend, too. ""I wouldn't say on the weekend, just because a few of the games were close, that all that ground's been made up and everything's hunky dory,"" NSW defence coach Jason Gilmore said in Sydney on Tuesday. ""I still think we're probably a step or two behind, but we are catching up and I think the next month of football will show whether the Aussie teams can turn those close losses into close victories. ""When you're getting consistency of wins then that's when you can say the Aussie teams are catching up, have caught up, and are doing well."" Wallabies coach Dave Rennie was of a similar view in Melbourne for this week's Bledisloe Cup announcement, that while the Round 11 results were good, the Australian sides need to follow it up this weekend. ""It gives us confidence, it gives our players confidence to know that playing against some of the best players in the world and they can stand up,"" Rennie said. The test for the players, and the Australian teams in general, is going to be repeating those great showings from last weekend again this weekend. All the doom and gloom being suddenly expressed in New Zealand this week will disappear in a flash with normal programming resumed if more wins aren't recorded in Round 12. ""I'm sure they are feeling a little bit of pressure, and if we can go over there and put a little but more pressure on them, that'd be great,"" Brumbies scrumhalf and stand-in captain Nic White told ABC Sport on Wednesday. ""But it's also a good chance for us to go over there and see how our systems cope, because there's no bigger test than playing a Kiwi team over there. ""There's no better feeling than going away and working hard for a win, so it's all there for us, and it'll be exciting to see how we do go under that sort of heat. ""I think we've got the right mentality at the moment to get that right.""

43,Miracle last-second try delivers Australia first women's rugby sevens World Series title since 2018,sport," Sport Australia secure first women's rugby sevens World Series title since 2018 For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australia have secured their first women's rugby sevens World Series title since 2018, sweetening the deal with a try after the full-time siren to beat rivals New Zealand 21-17 in the final of the Langford, Canada round. Trailing by three in the decider, Australia forced a turnover with just five seconds remaining and then defied exhaustion to control possession and carry the ball 85 metres before Lily Dick broke the line to score. Three wins and a bronze at the previous four legs meant Tim Walsh's side only needed a top-three finish to claim the world series title with one round remaining. That dominance was helped by the fact New Zealand hadn't featured until now due to their country's COVID-19 restrictions. ""It was so great to have New Zealand back; we've been looking forward to playing them for such a long time after not matching up in Tokyo (where New Zealand won Olympic gold),"" Australian star Charlotte Caslick said. ""It would have been bittersweet if we didn't come away with a tournament win, so we'll be celebrating pretty hard tonight."" The sides traded tries, Sharni Williams kicking both conversions to keep Australia ahead 14-10 late in the second half. But when Michaela Blyde shrugged off two tackles to score with 90 seconds remaining it looked as if New Zealand would steal a win in their World Series return. A crucial turnover at the breakdown came with just seconds to spare though, Caslick then throwing a bold, cut-out pass that found Dick for the match-winner. Victory ended a run of five defeats in finals to New Zealand, who have dominated the tour since pipping the hosts in overtime to claim the 2018 Commonwealth Games title on the Gold Coast. It sets up a tasty rematch later this year at Birmingham's Commonwealth Games, although there is still the final World Series leg to be played in Toulouse later this month.

44,Kane double sinks Arsenal in crucial North London derby win for Spurs,sport,"  Harry Kane guides Tottenham to crucial North London Derby win over Arsenal For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tottenham has revived its hopes of beating Arsenal to the final Champions League qualification position by overwhelming the fierce North London rival 3-0, their biggest derby win since the 1980s. Harry Kane scored twice — including one from the penalty spot — and Son Heung-min added the other just after half-time in Thursday's crucial clash as the race for European places comes down to the wire. The win moved Tottenham just a point behind fourth-placed Arsenal, which had centre back Rob Holding sent off in the 33rd minute when they were 1-0 down. There are two games remaining for each team and fifth-placed Spurs have what looks an easier finish to the season than Arsenal. While Spurs face two of the bottom four — Burnley and already-relegated Norwich — Arsenal must travel to Newcastle before a home game against Everton. Arsenal was responsible for its own downfall, with full back Cedric Soares barging into Son at the back post for the penalty that Kane rolled into the corner in the 22nd minute. Holding, already booked for pulling back Son, then opted to stick out an elbow to block off the South Korea forward rather than track his run following Eric Dier's ball over the top of the Arsenal defence. Holding connected with the face of Son — who slumped to the ground — and was shown a second yellow card in the 33rd. It got worse for Arsenal four minutes later when Son swung over a corner from the right, with Rodrigo Bentancur heading the ball towards goal, and Kane stooping to head home at the back post from barely a metre out. Son moved one goal behind Liverpool's Mohamed Salah in the race to be the league's top scorer by curling home the third goal from inside the area in the 47th minute. Son has 10 goals in his past eight league games and is on 21 for the campaign, his best yet for Spurs. A miserable evening for Arsenal was capped by defender Gabriel hobbling off with an apparent right hamstring injury. With Holding suspended and Ben White only fit enough to make the bench after a recent injury, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's central-defensive resources are being stretched at just the wrong time. Manchester City and Liverpool are already sure of being in next season's Champions League, while third-placed Chelsea is set to join them, sitting four points ahead of Arsenal and needing one win from their remaining games against Leicester and already-relegated Watford. It means Arsenal and Tottenham look to be battling for the final spot in a race that should go down to the final day of the season. Tottenham arguably could have won by more to boost their already-massive goal difference over Arsenal, but it remains in fifth with the Gunners still in the driving seat in the battle for fourth place. The gap between them is now only one point with both sides having two games remaining. Arsenal face Newcastle United away and Everton at home while Tottenham host Burnley and finish at relegated Norwich City in the penultimate round of the season.

45,'A special day': Western United to join A-League Women next season,sport," Sport A-League Women to welcome Western United as 11th team in 2022/23 season For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Western United have received an A-League Women (ALW) licence and will enter a team in the 2022/23 season. The ALW will expand to 11 teams with United's entry, a season after Wellington Phoenix joined. Victoria-based United announced the news at a club function on Thursday ahead of their A-League Men team's elimination final. ""This is a special day in the history of our club. This is one of those days that will stick out on the timeline when you look back 10, 20, 30 years from now,"" club chairman Jason Sourasis said. ""To be a truly equal, inclusive club and to represent all people in the west, it was a non-negotiable from the start that Western United needed to have a women's team. ""For Western United to enter the league, just in time as the Women's World Cup comes to Australia next year, is massive. ""Everyone at the club is excited about this next step in our journey and we are all committed to bringing success on the pitch with our women's pathway."" United's entry is expected to tie in with an extension of the ALW season length ahead of the Women's World Cup, with the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) set to make further announcements in the coming months. The ALW newcomers, who have an established partnership with National Premier Leagues Women's team Calder United, will soon appoint coaching and football department staff and begin compiling their inaugural squad. Central Coast Mariners were also originally expected to join for the upcoming season. The Mariners want to have an ALW team again — for the first time since 2009 — and are still presenting their proposal to the APL and Football Australia, amid Anytime Fitness co-founder Richard Peil recently buying into the club.

46,'Pretty pissed off': MCG friendly between Argentina and Brazil cancelled,sport," Sport Football friendly scheduled between Brazil and Argentina at the MCG called off For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Brazil's glamour friendly international against Argentina, scheduled for Melbourne next month, has been cancelled. The June 11 match at the MCG had been planned as part of Brazil's preparations for the World Cup later this year, but the event organisers and Brazilian federation have announced the game is off because South American champions Argentina won't travel. ""Regrettably, event organisers have been informed [that] contrary to their prior agreement and commitment to do so, Argentina are no longer prepared to travel to Australia for the match against Brazil,"" organisers said in a statement. The last time the South American giants played a 'Superclasico' at the MCG five years ago, more than 95,000 fans turned out to watch Argentinian legend Lionel Messi take a bow. Victorian sports minster Martin Pakula said he was 'pretty pissed off' at the decision after almost 60,000 tickets had already been sold. ""I think they owe Australian football fans an explanation,"" he said. ""I'd be pretty wary of a football association that just breaks contract."" The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) confirmed the news of the cancellation at a press conference on Wednesday morning, saying the decision had been down to the Argentine federation. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) has made no comment on the issue. The cancellation follows a ruling by FIFA on Monday that the two teams would still have to play their qualifying tie which was suspended in September shortly after kickoff and never completed because officials complained of Argentina players violating COVID-19 protocols. FIFA wants the game played this September, a couple of months before the World Cup finals start in Qatar, but neither of the teams, who qualified automatically at the top of their South American group, have committed to playing it. As one of the most acclaimed young poets in Australia, van Neerven is now turning their attention to sports writing. Juninho Paulista, co-ordinator of the Brazilian team, said at the news conference: ""A statement came from the AFA, officially, and they informed us of this decision. ""We were prepared and with all the logistics ready for this game because we understood that we had to fulfil the contract"", Paulista added. Organisers now says they are ""working with the key stakeholders connected with the match to review all options for the fixture and will provide further updates as quickly as possible."" Ticket holders will be eligible for refunds with details of the process to be provided shortly, the organisers added.

47,Ange Postecoglou silences critics the only way he knows how — by winning,sport," Sport Ange Postecoglou silences doubters with superb debut season in Europe, claiming Scottish Premiership with Celtic For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency We shouldn't have been surprised. In fact, plenty of Australian football fans will say they foresaw this success for Ange Postecoglou, even if the rest of the footballing world barely disguised their lack of faith. And yet, Postecoglou has silenced those European sceptics to lead Celtic to a thoroughly deserved Scottish Premiership title at the first time of asking, clinching the title with a 1-1 draw away to Dundee United. Twelve months ago even the hardiest of Celtic fans would have had a hard time believing this was possible. Celtic were at a low ebb, without a manager and facing a resurgent Rangers that had comprehensively ended their tilt at a tenth successive title, beating Celtic into second by 25 points. Bitter rivals Rangers, under Steven Gerrard, won that year's Premiership with a whopping six games to go — the earliest a side has ever won the league. It was the first season since 2009/10 that Celtic had failed to win a trophy. Players were leaving, the fans were off side and their biggest rivals were on the up: hardly a good time for an enigmatic and underrated coach from Australia to take charge of one of Europe's biggest clubs, one would think. And yet for Postecoglou, perhaps it was. After all, his style demands total buy in, a sea change in belief and style that can only come when a club is, perhaps open to change. That's what happened in Brisbane with the Roar, which required a wholesale clear out of some of Australian football's biggest names to create a team nicknamed Roarcelona such was their attractive style of play. It happened with Australia too, after the Socceroos had been hammered 6-0 by both Brazil and France in successive matches prior to him taking charge. He led the Socceroos to Asian Cup success in 2015 and World Cup qualification in 2018. It was also the case at Yokahama with an F.Marinos side that had not won a title in 15 years prior to being blessed by the presence of Postecoglou. In Japan, Postecolgou was given time, finishing 12th in his first season before his methods and philosophy permeated through a near-impregnable language barrier to create the free-flowing style that earned them the J-League title the following year. At Celtic, time is not a luxury afforded to anyone. ""This isn't a club that should go years without any trophies,"" Postecoglou told the BBC after winning this year's League Cup with Celtic, ending a brief trophy drought. ""My first task when I took the role was to give the fans hope. ""I couldn't guarantee success, but I could give them hope."" He couldn't guarantee success, but he sure has delivered it, overhauling a cavernous points deficit to Rangers from the previous year to fly past and win with a game to spare. Managing Celtic was a challenge unlike anything Postecoglou had ever faced in his extensive, 26-year managerial career to date. Such is the relative strength of Glasgow's Old Firm, matches between the pair are what count, with the rest of the 12-team league expected to be swatted aside with ease. Every club hopes for success. Few demand it. Rangers and Celtic, the two enormous fish in the ever-shrinking Scottish Premiership pond, are expected to win the title every year — Celtic have not finished any lower than second in the league in 27 years. In Old Firm matches this season, honours have been even: Five games in league and cup, two wins apiece and a draw the result. It's in the matches that Celtic have been expected to win that they have bettered Rangers, who struggled in January and February having lost manager Gerrard in November. That's not always been the case with Postecoglou teams due to his adherence to a set style of play with a view to continually develop, rather than eke out wins by any means necessary. That philosophical rigidity only impacted Celtic at the start of the year, when Celtic took just two wins and a draw from eight matches to sit sixth on the ladder. The doubters sharpened their pitchforks, but the squad, bolstered by 14 new signings, were starting to gel and the free-flowing style for which Postecoglou has become synonymous was proving far too much for Scotland's lesser lights. Those new signings have also proved to be a masterstroke by Postecoglou. Six Celtic players were named in the Professional Footballers Association SPL team of the year. Four of them: Cameron Carters-Vickers, Josip Juranović, Jota and Kyogo Furuhashi, were signed by Postecoglou. Kyogo is the most interesting of those signings given he is one of four J-League players that followed Postecoglou from Japan to Europe — moves that raised eyebrows when they were announced. Postecoglou was greeted with heaps of scorn from the British press who cared little about his impressive record in leagues outside the limelight. Former Scotland striker Alan Brazil became something of the face of Scottish football's ignorance with his now infamous TalkSport segment. Rangers legend Ally McCoist, who laughed along with Brazil as he incredulously asked whether Postecoglou's naming as Celtic boss was a ""wind up"", has since eaten his words. ""He's done a great job there and has continued to do a great job,"" the Rangers legend told Sky Sports after Celtic's League Cup win earlier this year. But success at Celtic does not mean winning one Premiership, not by a long shot. If he wants become a legend at Parkhead, he'll need to win next year too. And the year after. And the year after that, with a smattering of cup successes and lengthy European Cup runs thrown in for good measure. Getting on top is almost the easy part of life at one of the Old Firm. Staying there is something else entirely. However, now he's shown his tactical wares in the crucible of Scottish football, Postecoglou will be a marked man for those who lead the big clubs south of the border. There is little doubt that the first managerial casualty of the 2022/23 Premier League season will lead to calls for Postecoglou's style to be blooded in England, particularly if he can lead Celtic deep in the Champions League, as big an ask as that is for a team with a fraction of the budget of the erstwhile Super League wannabes. That will be a different, bigger test again, particularly with financial inequality making measures of success so varied across the league. Would it be unwise to jump straight into that shark pit, as Gerrard has done with Aston Villa and former Celtic man Brendan Rodgers did at Leicester? Perhaps, but there is little doubt that if Postecoglou does opt to go down that route, or is at least given the chance, he will succeed. Because that's what he does and what he continues to do, everywhere he goes.

48,Saville's resurgence rewarded with French Open wildcard,sport," Sport Australia's Daria Saville, Chris O'Connell receive French Open wildcards For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A resurgent Daria Saville has earned a French Open wildcard, while Chris O'Connell's clay-court form has also seen him handed an appearance in the main draw at Roland Garros. Former world number 20 Saville has risen almost 500 ranking spots this year — from 627 to 132 — in a blazing return from plantar fasciitis and Achilles surgery. The 28-year-old reached her first WTA 1000-level quarter-final in Miami, the last 16 at Indian Wells and holds an impressive 14-8 win-loss record in 2022. ""It's (Roland Garros) one of my favourite tournaments. I did really well when I was a junior here, so I have a lot of memories,"" Saville said. ""I love being in Europe, I love the clay. I really enjoy being back on the tour. I've missed it so much."" O'Connell is now ranked 125 in the world after winning an ATP Challenger on clay in Split, Croatia in April. XX He reached the last 32 of the Australian Open following a straight-sets win over world number 13 Diego Schwartzman in the second round. The pair are among 10 Australians already set to play first-round matches in Paris from May 22, while a further 12 will attempt to qualify from Monday. With Ash Barty's shock retirement, Ajla Tomljanovic (41) is Australia's top-ranked player, while Astra Sharma (147) is the only other female confirmed in the main draw. Nick Kyrgios will miss a fifth-straight French Open and instead relaunch for the grass swing ahead of Wimbledon. World number 22 Alex de Minaur will lead the Australian charge in the men's draw, while Thanasi Kokkinakis (88) has also improved his ranking to earn direct entry.

49,Aussie juniors win world wheelchair tennis title in Portugal,sport," Sport Australia's junior wheelchair tennis team wins World Team Cup title, defeating Great Britain 2-1 in final For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australia's teenage wheelchair tennis stars have clinched their second World Team Cup junior title. The youngsters earned a 2-1 victory over top seeds Great Britain as the ITF's flagship team event drew to a close in Vilamoura, Portugal, on Sunday. Road to the title Riley Dumsday, at 16 — and a member of the Australian team that beat Great Britain in the 2019 final in Israel — earned the early lead for his team this year, defeating Joshua Johns 6-1, 6-1 in the first singles rubber. Dahnon Ward, also 16 — and currently ranked number three in the boys' world rankings — levelled the contest for GB with an equally dominant performance that also ended in a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Saalim Naser. It set up a repeat of the 2019 event in which GB had championship points in a match tie-break that decided the doubles and the title, before Australia went on to grab victory at 14-12. This time, Dumsday and Naser comfortably defeated Andrew Penney and Ward to score a 6-1, 6-4 win. ""It's been an amazing experience. So I'm very happy and feeling like the champions that we are,"" said Naser, 17. Dumsday, now a double world champion, said: ""It was amazing to share the experience with a new teammate and to have him on board, and also a lot of relief from the pressure of going into the deciding match tie-break in 2019."" In 2019, Dumsday partnered Finn Broadbent to victory in the doubles match tie-break.

50,Teen sensation Carlos Alcaraz wins Madrid Open for his fourth title of 2022,sport," Sport Carlos Alcaraz continues brilliant 2022 season, defeating Alexander Zverev to win Madrid Open for his fourth title of the season For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency When Carlos Alcaraz played in his first Madrid Open as an 18-year-old, his goal was to gain experience and learn from the top players. Only a year later, Alcaraz already feels he belongs among the best. * Position when new rankings come out on May 9 The Spanish teenage sensation capped another impressive week, with a straight-sets victory over Alexander Zverev on Sunday to win the Madrid Open and become the second-youngest player to win two Masters 1000 titles. His comfortable 6-3, 6-1 win over Zverev followed victories over his idol, Rafael Nadal, in the quarter-finals and top-ranked Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals. ""Last year, I was going through these experiences for the first time, playing against the best players, playing in the Masters 1000, and I learned a lot,"" Alcaraz said. ""Now it's different. I go onto the court knowing that I can win, with the confidence that I can win at any moment."" Alcaraz became the youngest winner in Madrid, and the second-youngest to win two Masters 1000 trophies after Nadal won in Monte Carlo and Rome in 2005. ""It feels great to be able to beat these players,"" the 19-year-old Alcaraz said. ""To beat two of the best players in history and then Zverev, the world number three. He is a great player. I would say this is the best week of my life."" It was Alcaraz's seventh straight win over a top-10 player, and his tour-leading fourth title of the year after victories in Rio de Janeiro, Miami and Barcelona. He also has the most wins this season, with 28, one more than Stefanos Tsitsipas. Germany's Zverev was trying to win his second consecutive Madrid title, and third overall. He had only praise for Alcaraz after the match. ""Right now you are the best player in the world,"" Zverev said before the trophy ceremony and joked about his opponent's age. ""Even though you are still 5 years old, you are still beating us all. [It's] so great to see, for tennis that we have such a new superstar who is going to win many grand slams, who is going to be number one and is going to win this tournament many times."" The jokes ended after the ceremony, however, as Zverev criticised organisers for the scheduling of his matches. ""The scheduling needs to be done better … Yesterday I started my match at 11pm. I played three sets. Finished at 1:30,""  Zverev told reporters. ""Until I get back to the hotel, until I eat, until I do my work with the physio because I have to prepare my body for the next day, it's 5am. ""If you stay up until 4-5am, the next day you are tired. If you do it two nights in a row, you are completely dead. You are destroyed, you will not be able to do physical activity on a maximum level."" Zverev — who was the defending champion in Madrid — said he was upset as the final had lost its sheen as a result since fans expected an even contest, even though the majority were rooting for the Spaniard Alcaraz. ""Everybody wanted to see a great fight. Everybody wanted to see some high-level tennis. But I'm also human, I'm not a robot. I simply I cannot be on my level when this is happening every single night."" While Alcaraz won his first Masters 1000 tournament in Miami earlier this year, he has since won in Rio de Janeiro and Barcelona. His first career title came in Umag last year. Alcaraz's three losses this season came against Sebastian Korda in Monte Carlo, Nadal in Indian Wells and Matteo Berrettini in the Australian Open. After long, three-set wins over Nadal and Djokovic, the seventh-seeded Alcaraz kept his high energy from the start against Zverev and was in control throughout the match at the ""Caja Mágica"" centre court. He didn't face any break points and converted four of the eight he had against the second-seeded Zverev. Alcaraz had 11 unforced errors compared to 25 by Zverev. ""I am 19 years old, which I think is the key to be able to play long and tough matches in a row. I am feeling great, physically,"" Alcaraz said. He said it was special to win in Madrid, where he first started watching tennis at an early age. ""Watching Rafa lift this trophy gave me a lot of power to work hard for this moment,"" Alcaraz said. ""It is a great moment for me. It is the first tournament I watched, so lifting the trophy today is so emotional.""

51,"Teenager Carlos Alcaraz continues Madrid run, beating Novak Djokovic",sport," Sport Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz reaches Madrid Open final, with three-set win over Novak Djokovic For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Rafael Nadal one day. Novak Djokovic the next. The list of victims of Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz keeps growing. And so does the hype over tennis's newest sensation. After defeating his idol Nadal in the quarter-finals on Friday (local time), the 19-year-old Alcaraz rallied to beat top-ranked Djokovic 6-7 (7/5), 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) after more than three and a half hours on Saturday to reach the Madrid Open final. ""It was one of those matches to enjoy,"" Alcaraz said. ""Despite the tension, despite being the semi-finals of a Masters 1000, being 7-6 in the third-set tiebreaker … I've enjoyed it. Until the last point I was being able to smile."" Alcaraz converted on his third match point to clinch the victory — his 27th of the year — in front of a raucous home crowd on the Caja Mágica centre court. ""To play against the number one player in the world, in front of this crowd here in Madrid, it's incredible,"" he said. A win on Sunday will give Alcaraz his fourth title this season, the most of any player. He has already registered tournament victories at Rio De Janeiro, Miami and Barcelona. He will face defending champion Alexander Zverev or Stefanos Tsitsipas. Alcaraz, the youngest player in the top 10 since Nadal in 2005, has won this year in Miami, Rio de Janeiro and Barcelona. He beat Nadal for the first time on Friday, and triumphed against Djokovic in their first match. Last week, the 19-year-old became the youngest top-10 player since Nadal himself. Djokovic remains without a title this season as he continues to try to regain his best form going into his title defence at the French Open this month. Alcaraz, the youngest ever to reach the Madrid semi-finals, took an early lead in the first set but Djokovic rallied. The Spaniard took the second set after Djokovic wasted three break opportunities to serve for the match, and kept the pressure on during the third until finally capitalising on one of his many chances in the tie-breaker. The match winner came was one of Alcaraz's more than 30 forehand winners that kept Djokovic on the defensive throughout. Alcaraz had 51 winners to Djokovic's 24. ""It was so close,"" Alcaraz said. ""He had the chances to break my serve at the end of the second set. In the first set as well it was so close in the tie-break. Honestly I don't know what made the difference."" Djokovic praised Alcaraz after arriving in Madrid this week, and said his son had already replaced Nadal with the young Spaniard as his favourite player.
