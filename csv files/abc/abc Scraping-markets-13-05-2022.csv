The ASX 200 opened higher and, by 11am AEST, it was up 1.4 per cent, to 7,039. And the All Ords was up a similar amount. That positive mood continued, with the ASX 200 eventually finished up 1.9per cent, at 7,075. The All Ords was up even more, at 2 per cent, helping it regain the heavy losses it had during the week. All the major sectors were in the green. The top-performing stocks were Life360 (+13.4 per cent) and Polynovo (+12.7 per cent). However, over the past five days, the benchmark has still lost 1.81 per cent. The Dow Jones closed 0.3 per cent down, while the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent lower. However, the Dow Jones had recovered some losses during late trade. The Nasdaq was marginally up, by 0.1 per cent. That's after the tech sector has suffered heavy losses off the back of higher-than-expected inflation data out of the US. Crypto is still struggling, but Bitcoin has recovered a slice of what it lost yesterday. By 4:30pm, it was back above the benchmark $US30,000. The devastating effects of the crash of crypto ""stablecoins"" Terra and Luna are being felt by many but their crash may have been orchestrated in one massive piece of ethically questionable trading. This is as investors say that people are putting their cash back into the safe haven of the American currency. The Australian currency was also down. As the ANZ noted this morning: ""The AUD is firmly below 69 US cents as global equities resumed their decline overnight. Pressure remains to the downside for the AUD."" Meanwhile, there's speculation that Europe will soon increase rates. Inflation is also a problem in countries there, with the shortage of gas especially putting pressure on economies. ""In Europe, we have recently revised up our inflation forecasts and anticipate the [European Central Bank] will hike rates in July,"" ANZ noted. ""The 9 June ECB meeting promises to be hawkish, as will be the [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting on 14-15 June.""

1,"Shares sink as bitcoin tanks, investors flee to safe haven US dollar",markets,"  Surging prices rattle markets and tech stocks, while Bitcoin tanks to below $US27,000 For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Surging prices — and the possibility of looming interest rate hikes — are rattling global markets and tech stocks, while the price of Bitcoin has tanked to below $US27,000 ($39,000). The Australian share market is tracking this global sentiment. At 1pm AEDT, the ASX 200 was down 1.1 per cent. The All Ords had lost similar. By end of the day, it was even further down. The ASX 200 closed 1.75 per cent down at 6,941 points. That was a 50-day low. The worst-performing stocks included Altium (-16.6pc) and Xero (-13.2pc). Overall, the All Ords also lost 1.9 per cent. This equates to $46 billion being wiped out in a day. Tech stocks were the worst-performing with the sector down 8.9 per cent overall. That followed the trajectory of the Nasdaq in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dived 3 per cent in the US on Wednesday (local time) as the latest inflation data there was released. It showed the cost of everyday necessities, including food and housing, is still rising in the United States, with inflation there now sitting at 8.3 per cent annually. Further interest rate hikes are now being tipped, after the data for April showed that inflation in the US was not slowing as quickly as many experts were anticipating. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 lost 1 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively. The tech losses are being replicated in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has fallen sharply again this week. It's lost more than a third of its price in a week, diving from above $US40,000 to less than $US27,000 by 4:30pm AEST. This latest crash prompted the founder of one of the largest holders of Bitcoin to post a photo of himself working at McDonald's. The Australian dollar also hit a low of 68.80 US cents. City Index senior market analyst Tony Sycamore said it appeared cash was being put into the ""haven"" of the American greenback. ""The DXY index just retouched cycle highs at 94.18. The dollar is king!"" ""US 10-year yields are trading at 2.87 per cent after trading as high as 3.20 per cent three days ago."" In April, data showed the CPI rose by 0.3 in the US. The rise came even with a big decrease in the price of fuel, and surpassed many economists' predictions. This puts the annual US inflation rate at 8.3 per cent. While these rates did surprise markets, they still show the surge in price hikes is starting to calm down from earlier this year. The April rise was significantly below the 1.2 per cent increase in March, when fuel prices were hitting global economies. Increases in the cost of housing, food, airline tickets and new cars were some of the biggest factors behind the April price rises. Prices — or core inflation — are rising at their highest rate in three decades in the United States. Here's why and what it could mean for Australia. After taking out fluctuations in food and fuel, the so-called core inflation rate was also still higher than expected, at 6.2 per cent. The food index rose 9.4 per cent, which is the largest annual increase since April 1981. Inflation without matching wage growth means people are essentially going backwards. ""Risks remain that persistently high inflation will feed through into inflation expectations and become more entrenched,"" City Index senior market analyst Tony Sycamore said. ""This increases the possibility that the US Federal Reserve will be forced to unleash more aggressive tightening measures, including an inflation busting 75bp rate hike. ""That may push the economy into a recession."" Price hikes have also been a problem in Australia, too, and were one of the reasons the Reserve Bank here gave for rising interest rates this month for the first time in 11 years. Globally, inflation has emerged as a problem as economies emerge from COVID lockdowns. Demand for goods rising as economies recover is part of the problem, but it's also due to supply chain woes globally, the war in Ukraine, rising petrol prices and other factors. The US Federal Reserve has already been hiking rates there to control inflation. Analysts from local firm State Street Global Advisors agree that the global economy is in a precarious position, as regulators globally try to ensure smooth transitions out of the COVID era. ""The global economic environment has become considerably more precarious following Russia's invasion of Ukraine,"" they said. ""This powerful stagflationary shock worsens the monetary policy trade-off for nearly every central bank, with the prospect of slower growth colliding with sharply higher inflation. ""We can't help but feel some nervousness around what may turn out to be excessively aggressive market pricing for rate hikes. ""We are concerned about a boom-bust scenario brought about by tightening that could prove to be too much, too late."" Meanwhile, this morning the price of Brent crude oil was up again, almost 5 per cent, to US$107.48. The dollar in your pocket doesn't go as far when you're buying something made overseas. And, with the Aussie dollar falling against the greenback, that's bad news for inflation. That rising fuel price was after the WHO said China's zero-COVID policy was unsustainable. Lockdowns in Shanghai have been one of the reasons behind the falling oil price, as it was reducing demand. This morning, ANZ noted that these lockdowns would remain a weight on the Australian currency. ""Concerns about China's strict lockdowns and their economic impacts will likely remain a weight on AUD in the near term,"" ANZ notes. ""China's accommodative policies suggest AUD can rebound rapidly once the lockdowns are relaxed.""

2,Consumer confidence plunges to lockdown levels while Australians prepare for the polls,markets,"  Consumer confidence plunges to lockdown levels while Australians prepare for the polls For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australians' confidence in the economy and their own financial situation has plunged to lockdown levels, just weeks before an election that is being fought on the rising cost of living. Here in Australia and globally,  markets are considering rate hikes, inflation, war and supply chain woes. The latest consumer confidence data from Westpac shows it is down 5.6 per cent to 90.4 points in May. That is the measure's lowest level since August 2020, when COVID lockdowns were hitting Victoria. Westpac's rolling data is based on surveys with 1,200 people. Its data for May was conducted just as the Reserve Bank announced the first interest rate rise in 11 years and inflation data showed prices are surging. ""Two stunning developments are clearly unnerving consumers,"" Westpac noted. The data showed specific concerns from people about their household finances. ""The prospect of rising interest rates is clearly weighing on respondents despite the prospect of higher bank deposit rates,"" Westpac noted. Despite this, it found spending is bouncing back from COVID lockdowns. The survey results come less than 2 weeks before a federal election that is being fought on the rising cost of living. The Australian share market was also in a dour mood on Wednesday that only improved in late-day trade. The Reserve Bank wants you to believe it has inflation under control. Gareth Hutchens asks: ""Do you believe it?"" At 12pm AEST, the ASX 200 was down 0.2 per cent. That took the benchmark to a 50-day low. But it recovered and actually finished up 0.2 per cent to 7,065 points. The top-performing stocks were Lifestyle (+16pc) and Life360 (+6.5pc). The All Ordinaries also ended up 0.3 per cent after trading mostly in the red all day. Super manager Magellan was up 0.8 per cent after appointing David George as chief executive and managing director. Mr George most recently held the role of deputy chief investment officer at the Future Fund, where he oversaw an asset base of about $170 billion. Losers included Link, which dived 15 per cent. The company told media it was not aware why this significant move was happening. Graincorp was down 0.9 per cent, even after the key food company posted a 50 per cent increase in revenue. The ASX-listed company says it's doing better due to better planting conditions for crops, along with higher demand for grain amid tightening supply globally. The supply of grain has been hit by the war in Ukraine, for instance. The Australian share market's volatility down came as markets globally mulled a maelstrom of factors, including war, inflation, rate hikes and supply-chain woes. Wall Street also had volatile trade on Tuesday (local time) but the end losses were less significant. The Dow Jones closed 0.3 per cent down, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both recovered some losses, with 0.3 and 1 per cent gains respectively. The Dow dipped as the market prepared for inflation data to be released tonight (Australian time). The RBA doesn't want to raise interest rates — at least not to anywhere near the levels many now believe are inevitable — writes business editor Ian Verrender. European markets also recovered some losses, with the DAX up 1.2 per cent. Meanwhile, the price of oil is down again, with it now below $US100 a barrel for Brent. The fall comes amid concerns about continued lockdowns in China, which could ease demand. Bitcoin is also taking another battering. It has lost about $US10,000 ($14,418) in a week. That is a quarter of its value, which takes the leading cryptocurrency to $US31,000. The last round of inflation data in the US showed another surge in prices. Headline inflation is sitting at 8.5 per cent, with the March data showing it is now at its highest level since December 1981. That is being led by surges in energy prices, including oil, and even on food. It is a similar story here in Australia, however, our headline inflation is lower at about 5 per cent. Even without the spikes, the US core inflation is still at about 6.5 per cent. Analysts are tipping that the US data for April will show the situation is calming down, however, that is not a broad consensus. ""The consensus of US economists expect headline inflation to decelerate significantly from 1.2 per cent/month in March to only 0.2 per cent/month in April because retail petrol prices have stabilised,"" ANZ analysts wrote. ""But core inflation is expected to step up slightly from 0.3 per cent/month in March to 0.4 per cent/month in April."" Higher-than-expected inflation could mean another interest rate hike. Currently, the yield on 10-year treasury notes is slightly down on yesterday, below 3 per cent, showing the market is not expecting a rate hike as much. The data comes out just before midnight, Australian time.

3,"$25 billion wiped off Australian share market as 'war, inflation, rate hikes' hit global markets",markets,"  Australian share market suffers $25 billion loss as 'war, inflation, rate hikes' hit global markets For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Australian share market has lost $25 billion as it follows Wall Street lower on concerns about rate hikes triggering a global economic slowdown. The All Ordinaries index opened down 2.6 per cent. That worked out to a loss of $64 billion in value from the previous close. The benchmark ASX 200 was also down 2.4 per cent on open. A loss of more than 2 per cent is generally considered a significant move. The All Ords had pared back some losses and closed down 1 per cent. That still worked out to a market loss of around $25 billion. The ASX 200 closed down 1 per cent to 7,051. Tony Sycamore, senior market analyst from City Index, noted that there was ""a massive volume"" going through ASX 200 futures this morning. The main losers on the ASX 200 included AUB Group (-9.9pc), Block (-8.5pc), Chalice (-6.7pc), Paladin (-4.8pc) and Ramelius (-3.4pc). Oil stocks were also down, including Paladin and Beach, as the price of crude dropped overnight. Market analyst Clifford Bennett said this drop ""has been building for several months"". ""The reasons for it have been around for a while,"" he said in a briefing note. ""The fundamentals of war, inflation, rate hikes and supply-chain disruption are all individually significant headwinds. ""When combined, equity markets have no way through."" Among the top movers were Polynovo (+15.6pc), Pendal Group (+8.1pc) and Life360 (+5.8pc). Business conditions continued to strengthen in April, while confidence eased but remained above its long-run average, NAB Monthly Business Survey finds. The gains came on the back of a long-awaited recovery in the recreation and personal services sector, where conditions rose 20pts. Both confidence and conditions now look fairly strong across most industries, with the exception of transport and utilities and construction, where cost pressures have been most acute. ""Conditions in most industries now look fairly strong although conditions in construction and in transport and utilities are being held down by negative levels on the profitability index, a sign that cost pressures could be beginning to take a toll on margins,"" said NAB Group chief economist Alan Oster. ""Across the states, there was a large improvement in Queensland, and New South Wales and South Australia also made gains, although conditions in Victoria eased. ""Still, conditions are fairly strong across the board."" This follows sharp losses on Wall Street overnight, as concerns there about interest rate hikes triggering a general economic downturn weighed on stocks, especially technology. The S&P 500 had a particularly bad run, dropping below 4,000 points during its first day of trade for the week, which is the first time it's done that since March 2021. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones lost 650 points, or 2 per cent, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fared worse with losses of 3.2 and 3.4 per cent respectively. That is happening as analysts predict more rate hikes in the US, and the nation awaits its next round of inflation data. US inflation has been soaring and rate hikes are generally seen as one way to control price hikes. It was one of the main motivations for the Reserve Bank of Australia also rising rates for the first time in 11 years last week, earlier than previous forecasts. Inflation data is out again later this week in the United States. Depending on whether it is still rising significantly, the US federal reserve may seek to continue hiking rates. ""We don't normally pay too much attention to short-term market movements, but there's some concern brewing in markets that we might be on the cusp of a significant event,"" market analyst Peter Esho said in a briefing note today. ""Ultimately our view is that each and every time the US Federal Reserve seeks to raise rates, the economy and growth will break and send us back to square one. ""The most vulnerable sectors of the economy are at risk, tech for example is already breaking with lay-offs being announced by the hour."" ""We now need to watch out for contagion events. ""The markets are more intertwined than 2008. Leverage is everywhere including crypto markets, which are off grid. The risk is in the unknown."" Ten-year US Treasury yields were around 3 per cent. They had gotten higher, towards 3.4 per cent earlier in trade, but pared back. This is generally seen as the market predicting interest rate rises. Tech stocks suffered big losses in the United States, including Facebook's owner Meta, Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Netflix, all with losses above 2.8 per cent. Energy stocks were also down on a lower oil price. European markets also closed in the red, with travel and tech stocks leading losses. The price of oil is also down 6.5 per cent, to US$105.05, as concerns about lockdowns in China continue. China is one of the world's biggest oil consumers. Saudi Arabia has also cut prices for buyers in Asia. ""Sentiment in the oil market will be dictated by negotiations with EU on a proposal to ban Russian oil,"" ANZ noted. ""Any sign of unity in enacting sanctions before the end of year should see oil prices react positively."" Meanwhile, the Australian currency was under 70 US cents. ""With a high correlation to global equities currently, pressure on the AUD is likely to persist,"" ANZ added.

4,"ASX slides, Westpac jumps after dividend improves and expenses forecast to fall",markets,"  ASX slides, Westpac jumps after dividend improves and expenses forecast to fall For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian shares have fallen, dragged lower by mining stocks, with investors globally maintaining a cautious stance over rate-hike worries and as tightening COVID-19 restrictions in Shanghai fuelled concerns about a possible recession. Chinese authorities reinforced the lockdown in Shanghai they imposed more than a month ago as part of their tough COVID-19 response policy that has hit economic activity. On the domestic bourse, ASX 200 closed down 85 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 7,121, with the real estate, technology and materials sectors leading the losses. The Australian dollar dropped below 70 US cents for the first time since January. Miners tracked lower iron ore prices and slumped 2.5 per cent. Sector heavyweights BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group were down between 1.3 per cent and 5.8 per cent. Financials lost 0.3 per cent while Westpac gained 3.2 per cent, to $24.60, after reporting a $3.1 billion cash profit for the first half. The bank said continued margin pressure from competition in mortgage lending caused its first-half earnings to drop more than 12 per cent from a year ago, but it forecast lower expenses in the second half of the year, with its cost-reset plan in full swing. The company also declared an interim dividend of 61 cents per share, compared with 58 cents last year. Suncorp dropped 0.3 per cent to $11.28 after reporting an $803 million growth in its home-lending portfolio in the March quarter. Shares of Magellan plunged 8.4 per cent on news about selling its shares in takeaway fast food chain Guzman y Gomez (GYG) for a cash consideration of $140 million. Technology stocks, which slumped 3.2 per cent, were the top-percentage losers in the benchmark, while gold stocks dropped 3.4 per cent. Domestic energy stocks were up 0.5 per cent after crude prices rose last week on supply concerns. Among the worst performers were Nvonix (-12.3pc), Imugege (-11.1pc), News Corp (-8.3pc), Block (-6.2pc) and Telix Pharmaceuticals (-7.3pc). On the flip side, Domino's Pizza climbed 2 per cent, CSL gained 0.8 per cent while Polynovo advanced 3.3 per cent. Trade was volatile on Wall Street on Friday. The major indices rose briefly into the green and the Nasdaq fell as much as 2.7 per cent. Both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 posted their fifth-straight week of declines, and the Dow its sixth. It was the longest losing streak for the S&P 500 since mid-2011 and, for the Nasdaq, since late 2012. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent, the S&P 500 lost 0.6 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4 per cent. ""The market is focused on the Fed being behind the curve and that's why the market is down,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist and co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. Fed funds futures priced in a roughly 75 per cent chance of a 75-basis-point interest rate hike at next month's Fed policy meeting, even after Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that the US central bank was not considering such a move. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 1.9 per cent, as regional shares chalked up their worst week in two months. MSCI's gauge of global equity performance shed 1 per cent, and emerging market stocks lost 2.6 per cent. Oil prices climbed for a third-straight session, shrugging off concerns about global economic growth as impending European Union sanctions on Russian oil raised the prospect of tighter supply. Brent crude oil was slightly down this morning, trading at $US111.88 a barrel.

5,"Fed raises official rates by 50 basis points, ASX gains",markets,"  Federal Reserve hikes official interest rates by 0.5 per cent, ASX rises, Dow Jones jumps 900  points For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The US central bank has increased official US interest rates by an expected 0.5 per cent to curb the biggest price rises seen in 40 years. In an unanimous decision, the US Federal Reserve has lifted the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a new target range of 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent, the biggest increase in 22 years. Despite a slowdown in the US economy over the first few months of the year, the Fed's policy setting committee said that household spending and business investment remained strong, although it noted inflation was high because of the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Consumer prices surged by 8.5 per cent over the past year, and in March, the US central bank lifted rates by 0.25 per cent, its first rate rise since 2018. ""Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined substantially,"" the Fed said. ""Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices and broader price pressures."" At his first face to face press conference in two years, Mr Powell played down the prospect of a 0.75 per cent rate hike. However, he said more 0.5 per cent increases were likely at the next two meetings. ""Inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing, and we're moving expeditiously to bring it back down,"" Mr Powell said. ""My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing and transportation."" Renowned investor says the failure of central banks to move interest rates higher, sooner, will lead to recession and an implosion in asset prices. The move saw the greenback fall to a one-week low of 102.48 on the US dollar index. Global investor Mohamed El-Erian tweeted that the Fed should have raised rates sooner, and the ""too exuberant"" rally on the US stock market after Mr Powell all but ruled out a 75-basis-point rise, was not justified. ""One big issue is that the #FederalReserve is already very late in responding,"" he said. And Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Anne Sonders warned about the risk of a recession in North America from higher interest rates. ""Although the Fed addressed the contraction in the economy in the first quarter, it focused more on the strong gains in final sales to households and businesses,"" Ms Sonders wrote in an investment note. ""For what it's worth, we believe the risk of recession is elevated and should not be dismissed."" The US central bank said its $US9 trillion ($12.4 trillion) worth of bonds would be allowed to decline by $US47.5 billion a month in June, July and August. The bonds will be allowed to mature and roll off the Fed's balance sheet, rather than being sold into the market by the Fed. The Australian dollar jumped by more than 2 per cent, to 72.66 US cents overnight, as the greenback fell to a one-week low. At 4pm AEST, the local currency had dropped 0.3 per cent to about 72.39 US cents. Spot gold, which is seen as a hedge against inflation, rose 1 per cent to about $US1,900 an ounce in Asian trade. Brent crude oil jumped more than $US5 a barrel overnight, or around 5 per cent, to $US110.35, as the European Union moved closer to banning Russian oil imports by year's end. At 4pm AEST, Brent crude was up another 1 per cent to $US111.22 a barrel. National Australia Bank saw net profit for the six months to the end of March rise 10.7 per cent, to $3.55 billion, thanks to higher revenue from the economic recovery and strong demand for home loans. Cash earnings, the bank's preferred measure of profit, rose 4.1 per cent from the same time a year ago, to $3.48 billion. It said it benefited from strong growth in lending (+10 per cent) and deposits (+12 per cent) over the half year. However, net interest margin, the profit margin from lending, fell 11 basis points because of tough competition for loans, partly offset by lower deposit and finance costs. Expenses rose and the bank said an agreement with financial crimes regulator AUSTRAC for breaches of anti-money-laundering laws would cost the bank $120 million per year until the 2024 financial year. NAB's interim dividend was 73 cents per share, fully franked, up 13 cents a share on the interim dividend a year ago. The bank's chief executive, Ross McEwan, said he was pleased with NAB's performance, although the bank had ""alot more to do"" to deliver for customers. ""We are growing right across the bank. We are growing business lending, home lending, unsecured lending, deposits and transaction accounts,"" Mr McEwan said. ""We are delivering better results because we are delivering for our customers and getting the basics right more consistently."" Mr McEwan told the World Today program that borrowers should speak up if they were feeling under pressure because of the rise in official interest rates, which has been passed on in full by the Reserve Bank. ""The big thing, for me with customers, if they are having difficulty please ring their bank,"" Mr McEwan said. ""Talk to us, so we can make adjustments for them."" ""But we anticipate that customers will be able to absorb the next few rises."" He said the bank had not seen calls from customers yet who were in difficulty because of the rate increase, and dodged a question about whether the bank would foreclose on a borrower who defaulted on their loan. NAB shares fell nearly 4 per cent in early trade. By the close, the shares had come off their lows and fell 0.6 per cent to $32.25. After three days of losses, the Australian market ended higher following an exuberant night on Wall Street. Aside from the banks, nearly all industry sectors were higher, with tech stocks, energy and miners leading the way. The All Ordinaries index gained 1 per cent to 7,639, while the ASX 200 index put on 0.8 per cent to 7,365. ANZ fell 1.7 per cent following yesterday's profit results, NAB lost 0.6 per cent, Westpac fell 0.25 per cent, and the Commonwealth Bank (+0.7 per cent) reversed course. AMP (+1.7 per cent) swung from loss to gain, as investors withdrew $1.3 billion from its investment funds over the March quarter because of market uncertainty over the war in Ukraine. However, AMP told investors to brace for a ""one-off impact"" when a contract to provide corporate superannuation for retailer Woolworths ended in early 2023,  with the supermarket giant expected to pull out $4 billion from AMP funds. The company's outflows were down from $2 billion for the first few months of 2021. Meanwhile, the best performers on the ASX 200 index were nickel miner Liontown Resources (+7.7 per cent), lithium miner Pilbara Minerals (+7.6 per cent), and concrete maker Adbri (+7.1 per cent). The worst performers were global investment company Janus Henderson (-13 per cent), app firm Lifes360 (-1.9 per cent) and infection control company Nanosonics (-1.9 per cent). Rio Tinto held its Australian annual general meeting and said nearly 16 per cent of votes cast were against its climate policy. Big miners gained on a rise in iron ore prices after China's central bank pledged more support for businesses hit by COVID-19 lockdowns. BHP  put on 0.1 per cent, Fortescue Metals rose 3.5 per cent, and Rio Tinto climbed 0.4 per cent. Australia's largest airline, Qantas, says it will buy the 80 per cent of Alliance Aviation that it does not already own, for $614 million. Allliance provides charter flights for workers in the mining industry. The takeover needs to be approved by the competition regulator. Qantas shares fell 0.35 per cent to $5.65, while Alliance Aviation surged 21 per cent to $4.25. Permits to build new homes fell by 18.5 per cent from February to March, on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the Bureau of Statistics. And the trade balance improved by nearly $2 billion — to a $9.3 billion surplus — as imports fell during March. Stocks on Wall Street surged as investors bet on the US central bank slowing inflation without causing a recession. They were heartened by Mr Powell ruling out a 75-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones index jumped 2.8 per cent, to 34,061, the S&P 500 index rose nearly 3 per cent, to 4,300, and the Nasdaq rose 3.2 per cent, to 12,965. It was the biggest gain in two years for the Dow and the S&P indices. Shares in ride-share firm Lyft fell by one third on concerns about the company's customer levels and spending. That was despite first-quarter revenue rising by 44 per cent, to $US875 million. In Europe, major markets ended in the red thanks to lacklustre earnings. The FTSE 100 in London fell by 0.9 per cent, to 7,494, the DAX in Germany lost 0.5 per cent, to 13,971, and the CAC 40 in Paris dropped 1.2 per cent, to 6,396.

6,Newspaper publishers plead for aid as paper price surges more than 80 per cent,markets,"  Regional newspaper publishers ask for government support as paper costs surge For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Empty offices, further journalist job losses, and even fewer sources of local news — that's what communities face without an emergency injection of funds by the government, according to regional newspaper owners. Australian Community Media (ACM), the country's largest regional news publisher, is leading a Country Press Australia (CPA) campaign for an immediate cash injection to compensate for an increase in the cost of printing newspapers of up to 80 per cent. The CPA has also called for ongoing support in the form of tax incentives and rebates for newspaper advertisers and a mandated minimum amount spent by government on advertising in regional newspapers. However, one publisher has broken ranks with other newspaper owners, declaring the newspaper business is still profitable and businesses should not be propped up by government. The headline ""Your paper in peril"" has been splashed across the front page of ACM newspapers including the Ballarat Courier, Bendigo Advertiser, and Warrnambool Standard. This was while the CPA, which represents 330 regional newspapers, met with federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher and opposition communications spokesperson Michelle Rowland. ACM editorial director Rod Quinn said the threat to smaller regional mastheads was real. ""It's an issue that's very serious,"" Mr Quinn said. ""Few businesses could survive an 80 per cent increase in raw materials. A total of 53 submissions are presented to a parliamentary inquiry suggesting ways to help save local newspapers. ""For the larger daily papers it's one thing. But it is most acute for the smaller, most marginal papers. ""There are some levers we can use — cover price, how many pages you print, even publishing frequencies. ""At the end of the day we love publishing newspapers, but after challenge after challenge we need government and politicians to listen. ""We're not talking about an academic problem, we're not talking about something that might happen in some time, we're not talking about anything 'airy fairy'. We're talking about something that will hit in weeks."" ACM suspended dozens of regional newspapers across Australia in 2020. It led to a $50 million funding announcement from the federal government to support media organisations. Meanwhile, News Corp announced a 13.6 per cent price rise for its daily newspapers in January. Norwegian-owned Norske Skog is the only manufacturer of newsprint and magazine-grade paper in Australia. A spokesman for the manufacturer said paper prices varied widely depending on whether a masthead had a contract or whether they bought on the spot market. ""Underlying market conditions including COVID, the war in Ukraine, rising power prices in Europe, and global shipping issues have all impacted [prices] more than anticipated,"" the spokesman said. Norske Skog encouraged publishers to seek contracts, buy Australian product, and ""not play the global spot market"". ""Recently we have closed two newsprint mills in Australasia due to the decline in demand that has seen the market reduce from 1.3 million tonnes per annum to less than 300,000 tonnes,"" the Tasmanian-based manufacturer said, highlighting its own cost pressures. Pyrenees Advocate and Ararat Advocate publisher Craig Wilson said he had not heard about an 80 per cent spike in newsprint prices but was told of an increase between 30-50 per cent. He said while that would drive up costs, newspapers could still make money without government subsidies. ""The newspaper business is still profitable, it's not like there is no money coming through the door. It's not like there's no advertising,"" Mr Wilson insisted. ""No businesses should really be propped up all the time by government."" Mr Wilson said if he can ""make a buck"" with two small newspapers, bigger publications should be ""chugging along reasonably well"". ""One thing [the government] could do in this part of Victoria, for example, is open up a [printing] press site,"" he said. ""We've all had to go elsewhere to be printed because there just isn't a press site with any capacity that can actually take on our work. ""We've had to find someone to drive to Wodonga from Ararat every week to go pick up a big car-load of newspapers. It's a really awkward situation."" Mr Wilson said it cost about $2,500 to print 3,600 copies of the Ararat Advocate and Pyrenees Advocate each week. ""The paper component of that is only about 20 to 30 per cent,"" he said. Regional newspapers already received $50 million from the federal government through its public interest news gathering fund, along with support in the form of the JobKeeper allowance during the pandemic. Mr Quinn said government support during the pandemic was appreciated but increasing costs meant hard decisions would have to be made within weeks if there was no further support. Across Australia, where newspapers have closed or gone online, some have taken their place. But many regional areas are missing out. He said the losers would be smaller communities. ""Between PING (the Public Interest News Gathering fund) and JobKeeper, it saved our business during COVID, but you can't keep taking hits of this magnitude,"" Mr Quinn said. ""It's all about community good. We know what these papers mean for these markets. We know they are part of the community fabric. ""We know, when we've had to go through very difficult times in recent years, when those papers are not there, even temporarily, the community reacts. ""I don't think there would be anyone who would argue that newspapers don't contribute to democracy. We are seeing increasing news deserts around the country, and do we really want to see a situation where some of these communities are without their paper and without their local jobs? ""Our readership online is building and there is no secret about the trends of digital around newsprint versus digital over time, but there is still a very loyal following for our printed papers.""

7,"ANZ half-year profit jumps, while Westpac tips outsized June rate rise; ASX loses ground",markets,"  ANZ half-year profit jumps; ASX loses ground after Wall Street makes modest gains For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency ANZ has seen half-year net profit surge, the ASX has fallen, while the US Federal Reserve is set to raise US interest rates again at this week's meeting. ANZ said after tax profit for the six months to the end of March increased by 20 per cent from the same time last year, to $3.5 billion. Cash profit, the bank's preferred measure rose 4 per cent to $3.1 billion. Investors will get a dividend payout of 72 cents a share for the half, fully-franked. ANZ chief executive officer Shayne Elliott said it was an important half year for the overhaul of the bank's business. ""The introduction of our new retail banking platform in Australia, ANZ Plus, designed and built by our own teams using the world's best technology, was a key milestone,"" he said. ""While still in soft launch, the first 'savings and transact' product on ANZ Plus, a proposition focused on helping customers better manage their financial wellbeing, is tracking well and will become the core deposit and transaction product offered to new customers."" Mr Elliott also acknowledged the rise in interest rates was ""going to hurt some people."" ""But at this point, people are well prepared for it."" National Australia Bank has joined the other big banks in passing on the Reserve Bank's 25 basis point interest rate rise in full, and the US Federal Reserve is set to raise US interest rates again at this week's meeting. NAB said borrowing costs on variable rate mortgages would rise by a quarter of a percentage point. It has also lifted rates on some savings accounts. The changes will start from May 13. The Reserve Bank raised the official cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.35 per cent yesterday to rein in spiralling prices. It forecast that underlying inflation could reach 4.75 per cent by the end of the year and the official cash rate could reach 2.5 per cent to curb rampant price rises. Within hours, the Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and Westpac, announced they would be passing on the rate increase in full to mortgage borrowers. The next official rate rise is expected next month with Westpac chief economist Bill Evans predicting the central bank could move by 40 basis points (0.4 per cent), as opposed to the standard 25 basis points (0.25 per cent). ""We have chosen 40 basis points rather than 50 basis points  purely because we expect that ""business as usual"" is increments of 25 basis points on a base of multiples of 25 basis points (in line with the practices of most other central banks),"" Mr Evans said in an economic note. ""We continue to disagree with the Board's base case and the market's expectation that the tightening cycle will extend into the second half of 2023."" The Australian dollar was up 0.2 per cent at 4:45pm AEST to 71.07 US cents. Oil prices rose during the day after falling overnight with Brent crude up 1.2 per cent to $US106.27 a barrel, while spot gold fell almost 0.2 per cent to $US1864.68 an ounce. The local share market gained ground in early trade boosted by the banks, but the gains faded over lunchtime. By the close, the All Ordinaries index finished down 0.3 per cent to 7,565, and the ASX 200 fell nearly 0.2 per cent to 7,305. The big four banks were among the best performers after they all raised interest rates less than 24 hours after the Reserve Bank 0.25 per cent increase yesterday. National Australia Bank (+1pc) led the charge, followed by Westpac (+0.7pc) , ANZ (+0.4pc) and the Commonwealth Bank (+0.7pc). Big miners, BHP (-0.6pc) and Rio Tinto (-0.7pc) weighed on the market as iron ore prices fell. Fortescue Metals (-2.4pc) said it would make a final investment decision by 2023 on its first green hydrogen project. Also going down on the benchmark index were vehicle parts maker ARB Corporation (-11.2pc) and buy now, pay later firm Zip (-10.8pc), and retirement homes company Lifestyle Communities (-7.8pc). The best performers on the ASX were financial services platform HUB 24 (+3.9pc), packaging manufacturer Orora (+3.4pc) and Virgin Money (+3pc). Electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi shares dropped 4.8 per cent to $49.73, because it did not provide a profit forecast in a trading update, due to COVID-19 uncertainties. It saw sales rise 11 per cent over the third quarter of the 2022 financial year because of ""heightened customer demand and strong sales growth momentum"" according to the retailer. Meanwhile, nationwide retail sales rose for the third month in a row in March as people restocked their pantries after the east coast floods in late February and early March. The Bureau of Statistics said that sales jumped 1.6 per cent over the month to a record $33.6 billion, and they were up 9.4 per cent from a year ago. ""Rising prices, combined with the continued easing of restrictions across the country has led to rises in turnover in all three months of the March quarter,"" said ABS director of quarterly statistics Ben James. Every state and territory saw a rise in sales except South Australia. Queensland (+3.4pc) and NSW (+1.8pc) had the largest increase in sales following the recovery from the floods and extreme rainfall. People shopped for household goods (+3.4pc) and at department stores (+4pc), ate out (+2pc) and bought clothes and shoes (+0.5pc). The US central bank kicked off its two day policy meeting overnight. Traders see a 50-basis point interest rate increase as virtually a sure bet with a 99.9 per cent chance of a lift in borrowing costs after recent comments from US Federal Reserve officials including chairman Jerome Powell. US stocks ended higher after a choppy session in which the major indexes fluctuated between gains and losses as the Federal Reserve's meeting got underway. Investors bought financial and technology stocks ahead of Thursday's expected increase in official interest rates by the Fed. The Dow Jones index rose 0.2 per cent to 33,129, the S&P 500 0.5 per cent to 4,176, and the Nasdaq rose 12,564. Nine of the major S&P500 sectors gained ground, led by energy stocks and financials. In London, the FTSE 100 rose 0.2 per cent to 7,561, the DAX in Germany rose 0.7 per cent to 14,039, and the CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.8 per cent to 4,932. Oil prices fell, with Brent crude down 1.5 per cent to $US105.96 a barrel. Spot gold gained 0.3 per cent to $US1867.78 an ounce. Starbucks revenue beat estimates as higher US sales offset declines in China, caused by strict COVID-19 lockdowns. Chinese same store sales plunged by 23 per cent as the country reimposed lockdowns after coronavirus outbreaks. Global same store sales increased by 7 per cent over the quarter, fuelled by strong growth in the US. Starbucks shares fell 1.4 per cent to $US74.33.

8,"The RBA raises rates for the first time in 11 years, Australian dollar jumps ",markets,"  ASX loses ground as RBA makes first interest rate rise in 11 years to curb inflation; Aussie dollar surges For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The ASX has fallen and the Australian dollar has jumped, after the Reserve Bank raised official interest rates for the first time in 11 years to curb surging inflation, which is running at an annual rate of 5.1 per cent. Official rates were slashed to a record low of 0.1 per cent in 2020 as an emergency response to the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank last raised the official cash rate by 0.25 basis points (0.25 per cent) in November 2010, which took the OCR to 4.75 per cent. The median forecast of 32 economists surveyed by Reuters showed the central bank would lift the cash rate by 15 basis points to 0.25 per cent from 0.1 per cent today. Instead, the bank made a full 0.25 basis point rise to 0.35 per cent, with the Reserve Bank governor Dr Philip Lowe saying it was time to start winding back the massive monetary stimulus that saved the economy from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. The share market is screaming a message right now: The economy is not OK. And the ramifications will hit all of us. The Australian dollar surged by more than 1 per cent to 71.4 US cents after the RBA announcement at 2:30pm AEST. The local currency fell to an overnight low of 70.31 US cents, prompted by the rise of the greenback to a 20-year high before another expected rate increase by the US Federal Reserve this week. At 4:40pm AEST, the Australian dollar was up 1.1 per cent to 71.23 US cents. Consumers are worried about higher interest rates after the latest inflation figures showed that prices rose by the most in 20 years over the first few months of the year, because of the war in Ukraine, the global supply chain squeeze and the strong Australian economy. ANZ said its measure of consumer confidence fell 6 per cent last week, the sharpest drop since the Omicron variant of COVID-19 swept through the eastern seaboard in January. Confidence among mortgage borrowers slumped nearly 10 per cent over the week. ""This is the lowest level for consumer confidence at the start of the tightening cycle since the inflation targeting regime began in the early 1990s,"" said ANZ head of Australian economics David Plank. The local share market opened in the red and slipped further after the rates decision came out, ending lower for a second day. Higher borrowing costs weigh on consumer spending, and banks came off their lows because higher interest rates raise their revenue. Westpac (+0.1pc) gained, while National Australia Bank (-0.7pc), ANZ (-0.15pc) and the Commonwealth Bank (-0.7pc) fell. Real estate investment trusts were hit by the prospect of higher interest rates, and the mining, consumer and financial indexes also ended lower. Technology stocks did the best, tracking their peers on Wall Street. At the close, the All Ordinaries index fell 0.5 per cent to 7,588, and the ASX 200 lost 0.4 per cent to 7,316. The best performers on the ASX 200 were Magellan Financial Group (+5.4pc), technology company Appen (+5.2pc), and buy now, pay later firm Zip (+5pc). Going down were vegetable and fruit grower Costa Group (-6pc), biotech firm Imugene (-5.3pc) and retailer Premier Investment (-5.1pc). In a trading update, supermarket chain Woolworths said it was still facing problems stocking its shelves because of supply disruptions and staff shortages from COVID-19. The value of sales over the third quarter jumped to $11.4 billion because of supply chain blockages and higher fuel prices, as inflation rose at the fastest pace in two decades. Woolworths shares rose 0.6 per cent to $38.51. Telstra announced that Michael Ackland would become the new chief financial officer to replace Vicki Brady, who takes over in September from departing chief executive, Andy Penn. Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes, has bought 11.3 per cent of AGL Energy, becoming its largest shareholder through his private investment firm, Grok Ventures. In a letter sent to AGL's board of directors last night, he said he would vote against a proposed demerger, labelling it a ""flawed plan."" ""Grok Ventures has acquired more than an 11 per cent interest in AGL, becoming the largest shareholder,"" Mr Cannon-Brookes tweeted. ""We will be voting against the upcoming, flawed demerger."" It comes two months after the company rejected his takeover bid. AGL is Australia's largest electricity generator and largest greenhouse carbon emitter. AGL fired back and told the stock market that the demerger, which would split the business into two companies: an energy retailer and a power generator, was in the best interest of shareholders. It acknowledged that its largest shareholder would vote against the demerger proposal. In a statement to the ABC, an AGL spokesperson said the company had not been contacted by Grok Ventures. ""The AGL board is committed to delivering the proposed Demerger, which will ensure the value created through Australia's energy transition stays with our shareholders. ""The AGL Energy demerger is on track to be completed by the end of next month,"" the spokesperson said. AGL shares fell 3.1 per cent to $8.35. Wall Street ended higher after wild swings between profit and losses. It was a volatile night of trade on the New York Stock Exchange, a day before the US Federal Reserve meets to consider its next move on interest rates. US stocks fell 1 per cent at one stage, after a steep sell-off on Friday, as investors worried about higher interest rates and slower economic growth. The Nasdaq turned positive in afternoon trade as investors bought up beaten-down technology firms. The benchmark S&P 500 rebounded after dropping to the lowest since May 2021, and the Nasdaq fell to the lowest since November 2020 during the session. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3 per cent to 33,062, the S&P 500 gained nearly 0.6 per cent to 4,155, and the Nasdaq increased 1.6 per cent to 12,536. Returns or yields on benchmark 10 year US Treasury bonds hit 3 per cent for the first time in more than three years. The 10-year yield is an important barometer for mortgage rates and other financial instruments. It has surged over the last two months as the bond market prepared for the US central bank to reduce its balance sheet, which ballooned to nearly $US9 trillion as the Federal Reserve bought bonds during the pandemic to stimulate the economy. The Fed meets this week and is expected to raise interest rates by 50 basis points, to 0.75 per cent to 1 per cent, to tackle the strongest price rises in 40 years. Oil prices rose overnight on continuing concerns over supply shortages as the European Union considers a ban on Russian crude oil because of the invasion of Ukraine. Diesel prices rallied 5 per cent to $US4.0172 a gallon as a low supply of global inventories put pressure on oil prices. Brent crude gained 0.6 per cent to $US107.62 a barrel at 7am AEST. Earlier in the session, Brent and West Texas Crude fell on the news that the European Commission may spare Hungary and Slovakia from a Russian oil embargo as it prepares to finalise its next round of sanctions on Russia. The EU is looking at banning Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, a major source of revenue for Russia. Hungary and Slovakia are heavily dependent on Russian fossil fuels.

9,ASX tumbles ahead of RBA meeting; Qantas jumps on profitability forecast,markets,"  ASX tumbles ahead of RBA meeting; Qantas jumps on profitability forecast For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian shares have fallen more than 1 per cent in broad-based selling, as investors braced for a central bank policy meeting where it is widely expected to hike interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. The ASX 200 was down 1.2 per cent, to 7,347 on Monday. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to raise interest rates on Tuesday, joining a long list of central banks now expected to tighten policies at a much faster pace than previously thought to tame surging inflation. Australian consumer prices surged at the fastest annual pace in two decades last quarter, likely prompting the central bank to move towards normalisation but as a consequence sparking fears of an economic slowdown. The RBA doesn't want to raise interest rates — at least not to anywhere near the levels many now believe are inevitable — writes business editor Ian Verrender. Almost every sector was lower. Among the losers on the benchmark, technology stocks dropped 4 per cent after their US peers fell sharply at the end of last week as the biggest surge in monthly inflation since 2005 spooked investors already worried about rate hikes. Xero dropped 6.6 per cent to $90.00, Tyro was down 5.6 per cent to $1.19, and Block lost 2.2 per cent to $142.00. Financials sank 0.8 per cent. NAB lost up to 1 per cent as the lender entered a deal with the country's financial crime regulator to address concerns around suspected serious breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws. Miners dropped 0.7 per cent, with BHP down 0.1 per cent. Shares of Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group were up 0.7 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. AGL Energy was down 0.7 per cent on news that it trimmed its profit forecast for fiscal 2022, due to a hit from the shutdown of a unit at its Loy Yang A power station in Victoria after an electrical fault with a generator. However, Qantas jumped 2.9 per cent, to $5.76, after announcing that it expected to return to profitability in the financial year 2023-24, and launching its direct routes from Sydney to London and New York from 2025. The company said it was experiencing strong return to domestic demand and recovery in international travel. It said it expected underlying earnings before interest and tax to be between $450 million to $550 million for the second half of the 2022 financial year. Shares of Webjet and Flight Centre were also up, by 1.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. Gold stocks fell almost 1.8 per cent as bullion prices dipped on pressure from elevated US Treasury yields. The Australian dollar was down at 70.52 US cents this afternoon. Wall Street equities closed sharply lower on Friday with the latest economic data and Amazon's disappointing quarterly report and outlook keeping the spotlight on surging inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 938.99 points, or 2.77 per cent, to 32,977.4, the S&P 500 lost 155.58 points, or 3.63 per cent, to 4,131.92, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 536.89 points, or 4.17 per cent, to 12,334.64. The Nasdaq showed its biggest monthly decline since October 2008. Amazon shares closed down 14 per cent after the e-commerce giant delivered a disappointing quarter and outlook late Thursday as it was swamped by higher costs to run its warehouses and deliver packages to customers. Equities were under pressure after data showed that monthly inflation surged by the most since 2005 while US consumer spending increased more than expected in March amid strong demand for services. Also, first quarter US labour costs surged by the most in 21 years, pointing to rising wage inflation, supporting Federal Reserve policy tightening ahead of its scheduled meeting this week. Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. Rates Strategy at BMO Capital Markets notes that the data could lead to a more hawkish response from the Fed. ""The operating assumption in the market at the moment is that the Fed has sufficient flexibility to ratchet up the pace of hiking in response to any further acceleration of inflationary pressures,"" he said. The pan-European STOXX 600 index had risen 0.74 per cent but MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.9 per cent. On the last trading day of April, the global index was on course for its biggest monthly decline since March 2020.

The ASX 200 fell 0.4 per cent, or 31 points, to 7,454. The broader All Ordinaries dropped 38 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 7,735. The Australian dollar was up 0.1 per cent, at 74.28 US cents. All 11 sectors on the ASX closed lower. Health care was the worst-performing sector, down 1.5 per cent. Energy stocks fell 0.5 per cent, tracking an overnight drop in oil prices, as traders fretted that the COVID-19 surge would cut demand in China and as International Energy Agency countries planned to release record volumes of oil from strategic stocks. Sector heavyweights Woodside Petroleum and Santos finished flat. Raw material prices dropped as China's stringent curbs dented market sentiment and fuelled worries the recovery momentum in the world's second-largest economy might lose steam. After falling during the day miners finished almost flat. Financials lost 0.3 per cent, weighed down by poor performances in the Big Four banks. NAB was flat, ANZ lost 1 per cent, CBA slipped 0.1 per cent and Westpac fell 0.4 per cent. Pendal closed 0.2 per cent down, at $5.29, after it rejected Perpetual’s $2.4 billion takeover offer, saying the offer was not in the best interests of its shareholders. The $6.23 per share offer for Pendal, a former unit of Westpac Banking Corp, was first disclosed on April 4 and was at a 39.2 per cent premium to the stock's close on April 1. Shares of Perpetual lost 0.4 per cent, to $32.15. Regis Resources gained 4.2 per cent, Bluescope Steel added 2.8 per cent, Elders Limited added 2.7 per cent, Uniti Group Limited gained 2.6 per cent and St Barbara Limited closed 2.4 per cent higher. Imugene Limited copped the biggest losses, down 8.7 per cent, followed by Zip Co, which lost 6 per cent. Rounding out the worst-performing five stocks were Pilbara Minerals, which fell 5.8 per cent, while Liontown Resources dropped 5.3 per cent and Paladin Energy closed 5.1 per cent lower. Meanwhile, business conditions have surged higher in March and confidence has also strengthened, according to NAB's monthly business survey. The report said confidence jumped in the transport, construction, and recreation and personal services sectors, and leading indicators also strengthened overall with capacity utilisation up to 83.1 per cent. Across the states, WA saw a significant boost to conditions as the border fully reopened. Conditions and confidence are now fairly strong across all jurisdictions. Overall, both conditions and confidence are now back around the levels last seen in the pre-Delta rebound, despite activity having more than recovered its pre-COVID level. ""Businesses reported very strong trading conditions and a sharp rise in profitability, which indicates demand is continuing to hold up as the economy rebounds from Omicron and growth gathers momentum,"" NAB Group chief economist Alan Oster said. ""Purchase costs reached records with elevated oil prices adding to existing supply chain issues, and labour costs are also rising as businesses hire more workers in a very competitive labour market. ""These cost pressures are very broad-based across industries. ""Overall, the results depict a very strong rebound, led by strong consumer demand."" Wall Street closed sharply lower on Monday as investors started the holiday-shortened week in a risk-off mood, with rising bond yields weighing on market-leading growth stocks ahead of crucial inflation data. All three major US stock indexes ended deep in negative territory, with tech and tech-adjacent stocks pulling the Nasdaq down 2.2 per cent. ""There's been two kinds of sell-offs in the past month or two,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. ""There's the rising yields, which primarily affects tech and other growth stocks, and then there's the recession/economic slowdown sell-off that affects energy and various materials' names. ""Today, you're seeing both."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 413.04 points, or 1.19 per cent, to 34,308.08, the S&P 500 lost 75.75 points, or 1.69 per cent, to 4,412.53, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 299.04 points, or 2.18 per cent, to 13,411.96. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury yield hovered near a three-year high ahead of key inflation data expected on Tuesday. The US Federal Reserve has vowed to aggressively tackle scorching inflation, and market participants largely expect a series of 50-basis-point interest rate hikes from the central bank in the coming months. ""All eyes on an inflation number that’s probably going to be the highest in 40 years, which could prompt higher and more frequent [interest] rate hikes from the Fed,"" Mr Tuz added. The Labor Department's CPI report is expected on Tuesday for any sign the inflation wave has crested. Analysts expect the report will show an 8.5 per cent year-on-year growth in consumer prices, the hottest reading since 1981. Ongoing geopolitical strife also helped prompt the flight to safety. Ukraine said it expected Russia to launch a huge new offensive soon as the most serious conflict in Europe since the Balkan wars of the 1990s wore on, despite ongoing peace negotiations. All 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in the red, with energy shares suffering the biggest percentage losses. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed down 1.33 per cent and the pan-European STOXX 600 index slid 0.59 per cent as regional bourses fell with the exception of France's CAC 40. Oil prices dropped by about $US4 a barrel, with Brent tumbling below $US100 on plans to release record volumes of crude from strategic reserves and on continuing COVID-19 lockdowns in China. Brent crude oil was trading at $US98.97 a barrel by 7am AEST.

11,Banks lift ASX as US 10-year bond interest rates hit a three-year high,markets,"  Miners, financials lift ASX higher, BlueScope in $671m acquisition, US bonds hit a three-year high For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian shares edged higher on Monday, after last week posting their first weekly loss in four, as gains in financial stocks outweighed mixed signals from Wall Street in the previous session. The ASX 200 closed up 0.1 per cent at 7,485 points, while the All Ordinaries was flat at 7,773. The Australian dollar was down at 74.3 US cents, having fallen more than 2 cents from a peak last Tuesday. Gold stocks were the main resources companies to have a good day. Newcrest Mining, Australia's largest listed gold miner, rose 2.1 per cent. Separately, Australian miner Western Areas agreed to a revised takeover offer from nickel-lithium miner IGO. Shares of IGO and Western Areas rose 2.3 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively. Financials rose, lifted by gains for the big four banks. NAB and ANZ advanced 1.5 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively, while CBA and Westpac added 1.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent. BlueScope Steel jumped 0.8 per cent, set for its best day in one week after signing an agreement to acquire Cornerstone Building Brand's coil coatings business for $US500 million ($671 million). On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended lower in choppy trades as investors assessed the economic outlook with the Fed moving to fight inflation. Last week's release of minutes from the Fed's March meeting showed ""many"" officials were prepared to raise rates in 50-basis-point increments in coming months. The US dollar index advanced to 100 for the first time in nearly two years. In Treasuries, the 10-year yield hit 2.73 per cent, its highest since March 2019, and the yield on 10-year inflation-protected securities went within 15 basis points of turning positive for the first time in over two years. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 5.2 basis points to 2.706 per cent while the two-year note yield was up 5.8 basis points at 2.520 per cent, leaving the 2/10 spread at 18.41 basis points. Australian Government 10-year bonds meanwhile passed a 3 per cent yield for the first time since July 2015, in a further sign of how far markets expect interest rates to rise from previous lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.55 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 34,721.12, the S&P 500 lost 11.93 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 4,488.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.30 points, or 1.34 per cent, to 13,711. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.31 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.04 per cent. French presidential election risk was also evident in bond markets as French borrowing costs rose while yields of other core European government bonds fell. In the energy market, oil prices rose 2 per cent on Friday but registered their second straight weekly decline. Member nations of the International Energy Agency (IEA) will release 60 million barrels over the next six months, with the United States matching that amount as part of its 180 million barrel release announced in March. Brent crude futures were down 1.9 per cent, trading at $US100.87 a barrel, by 5:10pm AEST.

12,"ASX rises as Wall Street economic worries ease, with oil and iron ore down",markets,"  ASX rises as Wall Street economic worries ease, with oil and iron ore down For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Australian share market has finished the week just where it started, following Wall Street coming back from losses induced by rate-hike concerns and the price of oil wavering again. The ASX 200 ended the day up 0.5 per cent to 7,478 points. The All Ords gained a similar amount. The top performers were Paladin (+13.1c) and Graincorp (+5.8pc). This takes the benchmark back to where it was five days ago, and means it is virtually unchanged from April 2021. Graincorp was up after revising up its financial year 2022 guidance. All 11 major sectors were in the green, with consumer goods and staples performing the strongest. This comes after Wall Street ended in positive territory. The Dow rose 0.3 per cent overnight (local time) while the S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent. The Nasdaq inched up marginally. Consumer goods like Costco, Walmart, and UnitedHealth made gains. ""The positive tone (in Australia on Friday) reflects a rebound in the US share market,"" CBA notes. ""(This) comes after back-to-back session losses following the US Federal Reserve raising concerns over the pace of monetary policy tightening and a potential slowing in US economic growth."" Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank is warning of serious risks for those who are heavily indebted with limited savings buffers, while painting a generally upbeat picture of the resilience of Australian households as interest rates rise. Westpac has also been fined again. Today the Federal Court ordered its subsidiary BT Funds to pay $20 million for incorrectly charging commission payments to members of the super fund. That followed Westpac being fined $1.5 million yesterday for selling consumer credit insurance. Oil is wavering and is just over $US100 a barrel for brent. That's as the world mulls up what lockdowns in China and further reserve releases will do to global supply and demand. ""Oil prices have extended their decline overnight amid uncertainty that the Eurozone will be able to effectively sanction Russian energy exports,"" CBA added. Brent plunged more than 5 per cent yesterday, following the International Energy Agency's announcement that US allies will deploy 60 million barrels from stockpiles. The lockdown in Shanghai is also rattling the iron ore market. China is one of the world's biggest buyers of the commodity and Australia is one of its biggest exporters. ""Iron ore shed $US3.43 or 2.1 per cent to $US156.64 a tonne as investors assessed the potential fallout from China's COVID-19 outbreak,"" CBA said. ""In London, shares of Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP (BHP) fell 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively."" The losses had not yet appeared to hit these miners' Australian counterparts, with both BHP and Rio in the green by 10:30am AEST. All the major European markets ended down, with the DAX losing 0.5 per cent. Bitcoin is down 0.4 per cent to $US43,536. The Australian dollar was down 0.4 per cent overnight to 74.79 US cents.

14,Stocks fall globally as US Fed hints at bigger rate hikes if inflation persists,markets,"  ASX and stocks around world fall as US Fed hints at bigger rate hikes if inflation persists For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Stocks are sliding globally, including in Australia, as the US Federal Reserve hints at steeper rates hikes as soon as the war in Ukraine eases. Wall Street ended in the red overnight, with losses as large as 2.2 per cent on the Nasdaq. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla contributed to the tech-heavy sector's decline. European markets also dipped. Germany's DAX lost 1.9 per cent. The ASX 200 was down all day on Thursday and ended with a loss of 0.6 per cent, to 7,443 points. The bottom-performing stocks were Life260 and Liontown Resources, down 6.7 and 6.7 per cent respectively. Magellan was the top performer, with a gain of 10.1 per cent. Miners, including Iluka and Perseus, were also gaining as commodity prices moved overnight. Seven of the 11 major sectors were down, including energy, financial and tech. Meanwhile, Westpac has been fined $1.5 million for mis-selling consumer credit insurance (CCI) on its credit cards and certain sorts of loans. CCI is often dubbed ""junk insurance"" and it has been an endemic problem in the financial sector for years. It ended down 0.5 per cent, in line with the broader sell-off within the banking sector. The Fed's latest meeting notes showed many members of it refrained from voting for a bigger rate hike at the March meeting only because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The US economy is battling rising inflation and more rate hikes are seen as imminent to tackle this, with many analysts expecting a 0.5 per cent rise, not the more typical 0.25 per cent. ""Many members viewed one or more 50bp rate hikes could be appropriate at future meetings if high inflation persists,"" CBA noted this morning. ""We expect the FOMC to increase the Funds rate by 50bp in May and June."" The Australian economy is also battling price hikes, however the Reserve Bank only this week decided to keep rates at historical lows for a while longer. ""USD fluctuated modestly as market participants digested the FOMC's March meeting minutes,"" CBA's analysts said. ""AUD/USD dropped below its pre RBA level and is trading near 0.7510. ""Weaker oil and equity prices weighed on AUD."" Meanwhile, there are jitters about China's economy, with the entire city of Shanghai under another COVID lockdown. That's as the major financial hub battles 13,000 cases of the virus daily. ""China's COVID-zero policy leaves Shanghai still locked down with cases rising still, and nerves fraying about further spreads and more sweeping lockdowns,"" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said in a briefing note. ""China's Caixin Non-Manufacturing PMI slumped to 42.0 in March from 50.1 in February. ""COVID-zero restrictions and fears, along with downstream impacts from Eastern Europe appear to be sapping consumer confidence.""

15,"Elon Musk gets Twitter board seat, ASX in the red ",markets,"  Twitter offers Elon Musk board seat, ASX and Wall Street fall on fears rapid rate rises could lead to recession For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Twitter has offered Elon Musk a seat on its board after the billionaire Tesla founder bought a big stake in the social media firm, and the local share market has lost ground. Mr Musk disclosed this week that he had bought a 9.2 per cent stake in Twitter in March, making him the company's largest shareholder. His nearly $US3 billion investment is four times larger than that of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive in November. Twitter's chief executive Parag Agrawal said in a tweet that in conversations with Mr Musk in recent weeks ""it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our board."" ""He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long term,"" Mr Agrawal tweeted. Mr Musk tweeted that he was looking forward to working with the Twitter board ""to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months"". Reuters reported that Mr Musk would be involved in strategic decisions, including the direction of Twitter's Bluesky project and the addition of an edit button, which he set up a poll on Twitter for users to vote on. But Mr Agrawal warned users to think carefully about the addition of an edit function. Twitter confirmed on Wednesday that it was testing a function that would allow users to edit tweets after they have been published. Mr Musk will not have a say on the platform's moderation, including what speech gets banned or whose accounts get restored, a policy that applies to all board members. Bluesky is a company funded by Twitter to develop a new operating standard for social media. Twitter shares rose 2 per cent, following yesterday's 27 per cent surge on the news of Mr Musk's investment. The Australian share market lost ground after a US central bank official signalled the swift end of coronavirus stimulus to curb surging inflation. The market fell more than 1 per cent earlier in the day, but finished off its lows. The All Ordinaries index fell 0.6 per cent to 7,788, while the ASX 200 dropped 0.5 per cent to 7,490, with most sectors in the red. Technology stocks were among the worst-hit following a sell-off on Wall Street. Miners and consumer-discretionary firms also weighed on the market, but financial firms ended higher, including the big banks. Shares in US payment giant Block fell nearly 7 per cent, and energy producers dropped after a fall in oil prices overnight. Leading the falls were battery materials firm Novonix (-6.9pc), miner Lynas Rare Earths (-6pc), and Magellan Financial (-6pc). The best performers were coal miner Whitehaven Coal (+5.5pc), medical device firm Polynovo (+4.6pc, on record first-quarter revenue), and investment house AMP (+4.6pc). The European Union is proposing a potential ban on Russian coal imports because of the invasion of  Ukraine. BGH Capital raised its takeover bid for IVF provider Virtus Health (+1pc) to $8 a share. That is after Virtus recommended investors accept a rival offer of $8.25 a share from CapVest. The private equity firms have been vying for months to take over Virtus, with seven competing offers received. Virtus said it would consider the new bid from BGH. At 4:30pm AEST, the Australian dollar was buying around 75.77 US cents, down 0.1 per cent. It surged to a ten month high of 76.61 US cents overnight after the Reserve Bank signalled it was getting ready to raise official interest rates. At 4:30pm AEST, Brent crude oil was up 0.4 per cent to $US107.08 a barrel, and spot gold was down 0.2 per cent to $US1920 an ounce. Victoria's gaming regulator has started disciplinary action against Crown for allowing Chinese high rollers to use a Chinese bank card, China Union Pay, to bypass that country's currency restrictions. The Victorian royal commission into Crown found that the casino group had assisted Chinese high rollers to illegally transfer up to $160 million in funds out of China. It found that Crown was not fit to hold a casino licence, but recommended that Crown be allowed to keep its licence under strict conditions. That scheme had worked, the commission found, because Crown's hotel in Melbourne issued a room charge bill to the patron, which falsely stated that the hotel provided services. The customer would then pay their bill using the China Union Pay card and be given a voucher which would be exchanged for cash or chips at the casino. Crown could face a fine of up to $100 million. Fran Thorn — the chair of the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission — said she welcomed tougher laws that imposed stronger regulatory obligations on Crown and gave the commission greater enforcement powers. ""These powers are needed to deter Crown from engaging in the conduct that was revealed during the royal commission"" ""As a first step, we are acting on the royal commission's findings that Crown's China Union Pay process breached important Victorian regulatory obligations, was illegal and constituted serious misconduct,"" she said. In a statement, Crown said it would fully cooperate with the commission. Crown's shares fell 0.8 per cent to close at $12.75. Global miner Rio Tinto said it paid $US13.3 billion ($17.6 billion) in taxes and royalties globally during 2021, up from $US8.4 billion in 2020. Around half of Rio Tinto's assets are in Australia, where it pays the majority of its taxes. In Australia, Rio Tinto paid $14.8 billion in taxes and royalties in 2021, compared to $9.8 billion the year before. Rio Tinto shares lost 1.2 per cent on lower iron ore prices. Rio Tinto has joined other global miners and the maritime industry in a drive to reduce pollution in the export of iron ore. The Global Maritime Forum, BHP, Rio Tinto, and commodity shipping firms Oldendorff Carriers and Star Bulk Carriers Corp will assess the development of an iron ore ""green corridor"" between Australia and East Asia. The aim is to cut greenhouse gas pollution caused by the transport of iron ore by establishing specific shipping routes where zero emissions or near-zero emissions transport and logistics are more feasible, including the use of cleaner fuels such as green ammonia. ""Zero greenhouse gas emission pathways require the creation of a parallel value chain that involves new ways of working, new contractual relationships, and drives the development of decarbonised fuel production and infrastructure,"" said Global Maritime Forum chief executive Johannah Christensen. Stocks on Wall Street lost ground overnight, pulled down by technology and other growth stocks after comments from US central bank officials prompted fears that aggressive interest rate rises could cause a recession. Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said in a speech she expects interest rate increases and reductions to the US central bank's nearly $US9 trillion balance sheet as soon as next month to bring monetary policy to a ""more neutral position."" Ms Brainard spooked investors when she said the Fed could move as soon as next month to reduce its bond holdings at a ""considerably"" faster pace than previously, to curb inflation. ""The committee will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting,"" she said. The Fed official said the bond reduction would ""contribute to monetary tightening over and above the expected increases"" in official rates. The US central bank can either sell securities on its balance sheet or chose not to reinvest maturing securities. Kansas City Federal Reserve president Esther George said she supported a rapid reduction of the Fed's bond holdings and larger increases in interest rates. ""50 basis-points is going to be an option that we'll have to consider,"" Ms George said. Last month, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from near zero for the first time in three years, and released forecasts showing most officials thought the federal funds rate would end the year at 1.75 per cent to 2 per cent. Big tech names such as Amazon and Apple weighed on the Nasdaq, which saw its biggest daily percentage drop in about a month. The Nasdaq fell 2.3 per cent, to 14,204, the Dow Jones index lost 0.8 per cent, to 34,641 and the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent, to 4,525. On the other side of the Atlantic, the FTSE 100 index in London rose 0.7 per cent, to 7,614,  the DAX in Germany dropped 0.7 per cent, to 14,424, and the CAC 40 in France fell 1.3 per cent, to 6,645. Meanwhile, the US dollar hit its highest level on the dollar index in nearly two years, reaching 99.526 after the comments from the Federal Reserve officials. Oil prices fell overnight on concerns about the rising greenback and worries that rising COVID-19 cases could hurt fuel demand. Brent crude futures dropped 1.8 per cent, to $US105.70 a barrel, at 7:15am AEST. Spot gold fell 0.5 per cent, to $US1923.52 an ounce.

16,"ASX trims gains on looming rate rise, oil prices climb again",markets,"  ASX trims gains on looming interest rate rise, oil prices climb again For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Australian share market has trimmed earlier gains in late trade, as traders have interpreted the latest Reserve Bank minutes as a clue a rate rise is imminent. The benchmark share market indices were more than two-thirds of a per cent higher earlier in the afternoon, but both closed just 0.2 per cent up, with the ASX 200 at 7,528 points and the All Ordinaries at 7,833. The shift in the afternoon came as the Reserve Bank decision and governor's statement were released at 2:30pm AEST. This morning, NAB analyst Tapas Strickland said the governor's statement would be closely examined for further hints about the timing of the first rate rise. ""The key focus will be on the final policy paragraph and whether rates guidance is put on a more agile setting,"" he noted. ""The prior March post-meeting statement concluded: 'The board is prepared to be patient as it monitors how the various factors affecting inflation in Australia evolve'. ""If the RBA removes the word 'patient', markets will take that as a sign as a clear nod to the importance of Q1 CPI [first quarter Consumer Price Index] and lines up May or June for the first rate hike."" The statement did lose ""patient"", causing a surge in the Australian dollar, as traders brought forward their expectations of the first interest rate rise, with more bets now centred on June. The Australian dollar, already stronger overnight, gained the better part of a cent this afternoon to 76.14 US cents. ""The risk-on move spread to FX markets broadly, with commodity currencies moving higher,"" observed IG's Kyle Rodda in a note to clients. ""Higher commodity prices, expectations for tighter monetary policy, improving market sentiment, and a possible short-squeeze are tailwinds for the Aussie dollar right now."" The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil was up 1.8 per cent to $US109.41. ""Europe is contemplating further sanctions against Russia amid reports of war crimes,"" noted NAB's Tapas Strickland. ""Talk of Europe restricting Russian oil and gas has re-surfaced, driving oil prices higher."" Ampol was up 3 per cent, Origin Energy 3.1 per cent and AGL 2.6 per cent. Gold miners were among the major losers in a rally driven by positive sentiment and a return to riskier investments, with Silver Lake Resources off 2.4 per cent and Gold Road Resources down 3.4 per cent, although Australia's biggest gold producer, Newcrest, was up 0.3 per cent. Some more speculative lithium stocks also took a hit, with AVZ Minerals off 7.9 per cent and Liontown Resources down 6.1 per cent. Rare earths miner Lynas was down 5.7 per cent to $10.74. It was revealed yesterday in a market filing that Tesla founder Elon Musk had bought a roughly 9 per cent stake in the social media platform. That news drove Twitter shares more than 27 per cent higher, to close at nearly $US50. Tesla shares also rose 5.6 per cent. It also boosted the US tech sector more broadly, with the Nasdaq closing up 1.9 per cent. The broader S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average posted more modest gains, of 0.8 and 0.3 per cent, respectively. As in the US, tech names drove the best gains. The Australian listing of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's payments platform Block was up 6.2 per cent, to $191.44. Software firms Xero (+4.5pc) and Appen (2pc) gained strongly. Biotech firms Imugene (+4.2pc), Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (+3.9pc) and Polynovo (+4.9pc) were also higher on the positive, risk-taking sentiment. News of an ASIC lawsuit against Macquarie did nothing to dampen its share price, which was up 0.5 per cent, to $207.06. The corporate regulator is suing the bank for failing to detect a series of fraudulent transactions made by a financial advisor from 13 of his clients' accounts, costing them $2.9 million in unauthorised withdrawals. The financial planner is already in jail and Macquarie refunded the customers $3.5 million in compensation, but now ASIC wants financial penalties and declarations by the court for the bank's failure to put the transfers made under a ""fee authority"" through a fraud monitoring system. ASIC also wants a compliance order for an independent review of Macquarie's fee authorities and fee transactions using its bulk transaction system to ensure recommendations regarding improvements are effectively implemented.

17,"ASX rises, Pendal jumps on $2.4b Perpetual bid, US yield curve inverts after strong jobs data",markets,"  ASX rises, Pendal jumps on $2.4b Perpetual bid, US yield curve inverts after strong jobs data For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian shares have risen as heavyweight mining stocks have hit a record high and the gold sub-index has rallied, but gains have been capped by the escalating Ukraine crisis. The ASX 200 closed up 0.3 per cent, up 19.9 points to 7,514, recouping losses from last Friday when it fell 0.1 per cent. Ukraine on Sunday accused Russia of carrying out a ""massacre"" in the town of Bucha, and Western nations reacted to images of dead bodies with calls for new sanctions on Moscow, which kept a lid on investor mood. Mining stocks climbed 1.2 per cent. Iron ore futures in China closed at a near eight-month high on Friday as hopes for economic stimulus rose following a month of COVID-19-induced lockdowns. Global miner BHP rose 0.1 per cent and peers Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group added 0.3 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. Mineral sands explorer Iluka Resources jumped as much as 6.1 per cent after its board approved a rare-earths refinery project and secured government funding for it. Gold stocks climbed 2 per cent and hit a near three-week high. Newcrest Mining, Australia's largest listed gold miner, rose 0.9 per cent, while Northern Star also climbed 2.1 per cent. Heavyweight banks were down, with the financial index dropping 0.3 per cent. The mixed mood comes ahead of an interest-rate decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday. NAB, ANZ and CBA lost 0.8 per cent, 0.2 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. Westpac also dropped 0.2 per cent despite a marginal rise in the afternoon trade. Investment manager Pendal Group soared 18.1 per cent on receiving a buyout offer worth about $2.4 billion from asset manager Perpetual. Perpetual's shares were down 6.6 per cent to $31.97. Among the worst performers were Imugene (-4pc), Fletcher Building (-3.3pc) and Bank of Queensland (-3.2pc). The Australian dollar was up at 75.10 US cents by 4:39pm AEST. US government bond yields resumed their upward climb on Friday as a key part of the US Treasury yield curve inverted once more on signs of persistent inflation. Data released on Friday showed US employers added 431,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6 per cent, continuing a strong run of hiring that has left key aspects of the American labour market ""little different"" from where it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. With US economic growth so robust — and inflation running at three times the Federal Reserve's 2 per cent target — investors are widely expecting a drum roll of interest rate rises this year. Treasury yields — which retreated earlier last week as portfolio adjustments boosted demand for bonds — spiked again on Friday, causing a closely watched part of the yield curve to invert for the third time in the past week. An inversion of the yield curve — when shorter-dated yields rise above longer-dated ones — is seen as a harbinger of a recession in the next one or two years. ""[Friday's] solid growth of payrolls checked the box for the Fed in its drive toward fighting inflation,"" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income. ""Consequently, the Fed looks clearly undeterred in reaching at least policy neutrality and probably will do at least one, and maybe two, 50-basis-point rate hikes by the June … meeting, which could even include an inter-meeting hike."" Bets that aggressive monetary tightening could be in the cards did not drag equity markets lower on Friday. US stocks finished higher after a choppy session on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent, the S&P 500 added 0.34 per cent, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.29 per cent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index climbed 0.54 per cent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.16 per cent. Inflation in Europe is also running at record levels, with euro zone inflation hitting 7.5 per cent in March, data showed on Friday, another all-time high with months left before it is set to peak, raising pressure on the European Central Bank to act to contain prices even as growth slows sharply. In response, the German 10-year government bond yield, a benchmark for the euro zone, rose 2.8 bps to 0.58 per cent, after jumping 39 bps in March, its biggest monthly rise since 2009. ""Government bond yields have moved up markedly in recent weeks, and can be expected to trend higher over time, due to inflationary pressures that are here to stay and responses by the main central banks,"" Christian Nolting, global chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank Private Bank said in a note. Two-year US Treasury yields jumped to 2.4503 per cent from 2.284 per cent, surpassing benchmark 10-year US Treasury yields, which also rose to 2.3767 per cent from 2.325 per cent. ""Given its impressive track record in predicting US recessions — it's been almost 50 years since the last false positive — it would seem foolish to doubt that bearish recession speculation,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. ""Historically, however, the 10-year three-month [Treasury yield] spread has done a better job of signalling downturns than the 10-year two-year spread and the former is still close to 200 basis points,"" Ashworth added. Oil dipped in and out of negative territory ahead of a meeting of International Energy Agency member nations which is set to discuss a release of emergency oil reserves alongside a huge planned release by the United States. Meanwhile oil prices fell after the United Arab Emirates and the Iran-aligned Houthi group welcomed a truce that would halt military operations on the Saudi-Yemeni border, alleviating some concerns about potential supply issues. Oil slid 13 per cent last week, the biggest weekly fall in two years, after US President Joe Biden announced the largest-ever US oil reserves release. Brent crude oil was up, trading at $US105.46 a barrel by 4:42pm AEST. The rise in bond yields globally has been a drag on gold, which pays no return. The metal was stuck at $1,923 an ounce by 4:42pm AEST.

18,"EV battery manufacturer gains 9pc as critical minerals boosted, but ASX closes down",markets,"  EV battery manufacturer Novonix gains 9pc as critical minerals boosted, but ASX closes down For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Instability and inflation are continuing to weigh on global markets, with the Australian market finally coming down off a winning streak to follow sentiment down. At 2pm AEDT the ASX 200 had been up 0.4 per cent to 7,544 points. That took it to a 50-day trading high, and was a continuation of a six-day streak. However, in late afternoon trade the benchmark traded down and finished 0.2 per cent off at 7,500 points. Global markets, including the major index in Europe and the Nasdaq on Wall Street, made notable losses overnight as inflation data and instability spooked investors. Some of the top-performing stocks on the ASX 200 on Thursday were miners Champion Iron, BHP and Whitehaven Coal, which were all up between 2 and 5 per cent. The price of iron ore and many other commodities is continuing to rise amid the war in Ukraine. The ASX 200's top performer was battery and tech company Novonix, which gained 9.3 per cent. That was after news reports on Thursday that the United States has agreed to invest more in Australian critical minerals projects, which could further boost the resources sector. Everything from lithium to zinc is in higher demand globally for renewable energy projects. The critical minerals sector also got a $250 million boost in this week's federal budget. Tech was down as investors sold off stocks bought in recent days. Retail chain Harvey Norman was the biggest loser of the day (-6.1pc) while plumbing and bathroom supplier Reece lost 4.4 per cent. Both operate in the consumer goods sector that is being hit with inflation and supply chain concerns. Both Wall Street and the European majors ended in the red overnight (local time) as hopes for peace talks for Ukraine and Russia failed to end the conflict. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed down by 0.7 per cent, with retail stocks shedding 2.7 per cent to lead losses. Gas stocks gained 3 per cent, as concerns about supply lifted, driving up prices. Germany and Austria, which buy a lot of gas from Russia, have started contingency planning for what to do if their supply is curtailed. Meanwhile, early inflation figures out of Germany and Spain have showed price spikes there are continuing. ""Ahead of the EU wide inflation readings due for release on Friday, overnight Germany and Spain recorded their largest price increases since reunification in the early 1990s (or 1985 prior to unification),"" NAB notes. Spain's inflation jumped 9.8 per cent annually while Germany leapt to 7.6 per cent. The European Central Bank's president Christine Lagarde is warning that those price hikes could get worse and the conflict is posing “significant risks to growth”. ""Reaction to the inflation data and Lagarde's comments triggered a sell-off of EU yields led by the front end of the curve,"" NAB notes. Wall Street also ended a four-day winning streak overnight. The S&P 500 fell 0.63 per cent, the tech-heavy Nasdaq shed 1.2 per cent, and the Dow Jones dropped much less at 0.2 per cent off. The price of Brent crude jumped again on concerns about supply and the war. By 7:45am AEDT, it had gained 2.1 per cent to $US112.57 a barrel. The Aussie dollar was buying around 75.20 US cents overnight. ""Once the impact of the war fades, AUD is well positioned to trend higher over the rest of this year,"" ANZ notes. ""USD declined overnight despite a lack of signs of a de-escalation in the Russia Ukraine tensions. ""The war will increasingly fade as a major driver of currencies. ""In our view, the USD will start trending down before long as the global economy continues to recover.""

19,"Wall St gains despite 'yield inversion' recession warning, Telstra CEO steps down",markets,"  Wall St gains despite 'yield inversion' recession warning, Telstra CEO steps down For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian shares have risen the day after the federal budget, however, analysts say the cash splash wasn't ""market-moving"" and the benchmark more likely followed Wall Street's optimism about the war in Ukraine easing. The ASX 200 opened 0.5 per cent higher and eventually finished 0.7 per cent higher at 7,515 points. That is a new 50-day high. The benchmark has closed up six days in a row. Top performers included Life 360 (+9.6pc) and Magellan (+8.5pc). Nine out of 11 sectors ended higher. Information technology was the best performing sector, with a gain of 3.8 per cent. Tech stocks also did well on Nasdaq on Wall Street overnight (local time). Commodity stocks dragged down the market, with Whitehaven down 3.5pc, South32 down 3.5pc, and Silve Lake losing 2.8pc. This comes as the price of oil dips again, and as commodities continue their volatility amid the war in Ukraine. Telstra ended down 0.8 per cent after it was announced early this morning that chief executive Andy Penn is stepping down from the top job after seven years. Mr Penn was at the helm of Telstra during its major restructure, which saw 8,000 people lose their jobs. He will be replaced by the telco's current chief financial officer Vicki Brady from September 1. She will be Telstra's first female chief executive. Wall Street was boosted by talk of yield inversion and further optimism that the war in Ukraine could be resolved sooner than later. The Dow Jones gained 1pc, S&P 500 was up 1.2pc, and the Nasdaq gained 1.8 per cent with the likes of Netflix boosting the tech-heavy index. In trade, the US Treasury yield curve had started flattening with parts of it inverting, as investors price in an aggressive rate-hiking plan by the US Federal Reserve as it attempts to bring inflation down from 40-year highs. Analysts often see so-called yield inversion as a reflection of market concerns that an economy could go into recession. IG's Kyle Rodda said this showed ""the US economy is on a countdown to recession"". ""At least, that's what history suggests,"" he said. ""The 10-2 spread inverted overnight — an event that was closely watched and widely anticipated — signalling that the extraordinary pandemic boom in the US economy may come with an equally forceful bust. ""For many, the writing is on the wall: The Fed is going to tighten the economy into recession in order to bring down inflation. ""But other than some blaring red headlines and a few pre-emptive eulogies for this economic cycle, markets broadly pushed on with the risk recovery seen over the past fortnight."" NAB added that: ""The news headline writers haven't yet got their field day."" ""Even if it has gifted a suitable song title for today's missive,"" the bank added. ""The bigger market story has been a further lift in optimism toward some sort of Russia-Ukraine peace agreement."" European stocks also performed well, whereas the price of Brent crude also shaved off more losses. At 7:30am AEDT, it was down 0.9 per cent to $US111.43. The price of oil has been surging on the war in Ukraine, with the country that invaded it, Russia, one of the biggest producers. The surging price reflects concerns in supply, so it dropping again shows investors may feel that the conflict could ease. There have also been concerns about lockdowns in China, which could ease demand, too. Last night's federal budget contained measures to reduce the price of fuel at the pump here. Meanwhile, the local currency gained 0.3 per cent. ""As is usually the case, AUD/USD was not influenced by the release of the government's budget overnight,"" ANZ said. ""With most of the government's policy changes leaked to the media in recent days, there was little 'new news' for financial markets to digest."" NAB added the budget ""sprung few surprises and shouldn't be market-moving today or in the days ahead"". ""Beyond perhaps watching to see what impact if any it has on the Coalition's near 10-point polling deficit to Labor on a two-party preferred basis.""

20,"Oil stocks take a hit as brent price jumps around, while the ASX gains",markets,"  Oil stocks take a hit as brent price jumps around, while the ASX gains For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian shares have risen but oil stocks are taking a hit, as the price of Brent crude jumps around on fresh lockdowns in China and potential peace talks for Ukraine. The ASX 200 rose steadily throughout the day and finished up 0.7 per cent. That is it's sixth day in a row of trending upwards. The top-performing stocks included Magellan (+7.1pc) and Appen (6.7pc). Generally, tech and consumer goods stocks were doing nicely. On the flip side, miners Whitehaven and Iluka Resources were down between 4.2 and 2.1 per cent. However, oil stock Beach Energy was down 2.1 per cent. That comes as the price of oil has dropped again as Shanghai heads into fresh rounds of COVID-19 lockdowns, potentially subduing concerns about a shortfall in global supply. At 7am AEDT, the price of Brent crude had dropped 9.2 per cent, to US$109.60 a barrel. However, it started to recover as more talk emerged of peaces talks for Ukraine and Russia to be held in Turkey. Its price has been fluctuating to near historic highs with the war in Ukraine. The country that invaded it, Russia, is one of the world's biggest oil producers. High oil prices have added to inflation concerns globally and hiked prices at the pump, including in Australia. Petrol prices are so high in Sydney, Rebecca Matanale might have to leave her car in the car park because it's ""too expensive to take anywhere"". People in the outer regions of Sydney are feeling the bite of rising petrol prices the most, making them think twice about how they travel. Trade on Wall Street was generally muted on Monday, but was lifted by a hike in Tesla shares. The electric car-maker's stock rose 8 per cent after it said it wanted to split its stock to pay a dividend. That boosted the Nasdaq by 1.3 per cent. The other two majors rose between 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent after muted afternoon trade. Bitcoin gained almost 8 per cent as it continued its recovery. The Aussie dollar was trading near 74.90 US cents at the US close. Meanwhile, as the price of oil continues to put upwards pressure on inflation in Australia and globally, the latest consumer confidence data from ANZ shows concerns about price hikes are growing. ""Inflation expectations surged 0.4 points last week, to a multi-year high of 6.4 per cent of respondents, even though petrol prices declined slightly,"" ANZ head of economics David Plank said. ""Consumer confidence was essentially unchanged despite this, with a slight decline of just 0.1 per cent. ""Within the detail, however, sentiment toward 'current financial conditions' dropped to its lowest since May 2020. ""Consumer confidence is very weak, given the strength of employment, which we think is directly linked to concerns over cost-of-living pressures."" It found more respondents were now wanting to put off buying major household items. Meanwhile, the federal government is expected to unveil a suite of measures aimed at easing cost of living concerns in its budget tonight. ""The Australian federal budget looks set to be a very traditional election budget,"" ACY Securities chief economist Clifford Bennett said in a briefing note today.

21,"Miners hit over seven-month high on iron ore rally, Star CEO resigns, ASX rises",markets,"  Miners hit over seven-month high on iron ore rally, Star CEO resigns, ASX rises For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australian shares have risen as investors assess interest rate hikes and the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, subdued technology stocks limited the gains. ASX 200 closed up 6 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 7,412, extending its gains to a fifth straight session. Metals and mining stocks climbed 1.4 per cent, to hit a more than seven-month high, as iron ore futures extended gains for the second straight session after posting a fourth weekly gain on Friday. Heavyweights Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals Group and BHP Group rose between 0.8 per cent and 2.3 per cent. However, Chalice Mining and Liontown Resources were down 4.9 per cent and 4.7 per cent respectively. Financials gained 0.6 per cent, with the country's four largest banks advancing between 0.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent. Energy stocks were marginally down 0.1 per cent, with Paladin Energy diving 6 per cent to $0.78, as oil prices falling on prospects of a drop in fuel demand in China. Major oil and gas explorer Woodside Petroleum dropped 1.3 per cent and Santos was flat. Bucking the overall positive trend, the technology index retreated 2.7 per cent in its third consecutive session of losses. Shares of Block (-3.7pc), WiseTech Global (-4.1pc) and Xero (-5.2pc) were leading the losses. Among the best performers were AVZ Minerals (+4pc), Washington H. Soul Pattinson (+3.1pc) and Costa Group (+2.6pc). Shares of Star Entertainment Group were up 0.3 per cent, to $3.24, after falling as much as 1.9 per cent in early trade. The casino operator's chief executive officer, Matt Bekier, submitted his resignation on Monday amid an investigation over possible breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws at Star's establishments. Mr Bekier’s decision to step down, effective immediately, followed public hearings in connection with a review of The Star Sydney hotel and casino that raised issues, the company added in a statement. The Star Sydney is Australia's second-largest casino. He informed the board that, as managing director and chief executive, he was ""accountable for the effectiveness and adequacy of the company’s processes, policies, people and culture"", adding that the right thing to do was for him to take responsibility, the statement said. The casino sector has been plagued by a slew of regulatory inquiries in Australia. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was up, at 75.22 US cents, by 4:35pm AEDT. Oil prices turned positive on Friday after reports of a missile strike and a fire at Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company Aramco's facility. Brent crude oil wound back a little, trading at $US117.04 a barrel, by 4:35pm AEDT. The S&P 500 ended higher on Friday as financial shares rose after the benchmark Treasury yield jumped to its highest level in nearly three years. The Nasdaq ended lower, and tech and other big growth names mostly declined, but they finished off session lows following a late-session rally. Last week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registered solid gains of 2 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, and the Dow was nominally higher with a 0.3 per cent rise. The S&P 500 financials sector gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost on Friday, rising 1.3 per cent, while technology and consumer discretionary sectors were the only two major sectors to end lower on the day. Investors are assessing how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be as it tightens policy after Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week said the central bank needed to move ""expeditiously"" to combat high inflation and raised the possibility of a 50-basis-point hike in rates in May. US Treasury yields jumped on Friday, with the benchmark 10-year note surging to nearly three-year highs, as the market grappled with high inflation and a Federal Reserve that could easily spark a downturn as it aggressively tightens policy. Ten-year Treasury yields were last at 2.492 per cent after earlier rising above 2.50 per cent for the first time since May 2019. The equity market is pricing in a higher rate environment, said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta. That is causing bank stocks to outperform, while ""adding more pressure to the riskier elements of the market,"" such as growth shares, he said. Higher borrowing rates benefit banks, while higher rates are a negative for tech and growth stocks, whose valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 153.3 points, or 0.44 per cent, to 34,861.24, the S&P 500 gained 22.9 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 4,543.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.54 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 14,169.30. Economists at Citibank are expecting four 50-basis-points interest rate hikes from the Fed this year, joining other Wall Street banks in forecasting an aggressive tightening path against the backdrop of soaring inflation. The US central bank last week raised interest rates for the first time since 2018. ""The market's really macro driven,"" said Steve DeSanctis, small- and mid-capitalisation equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. ""Company fundamentals haven't really mattered."" MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.11 per cent, adding a second consecutive week of gains for the first time in 2022. The pan-European STOXX 600 index also inched up 0.11 per cent, but was down on the week.

22,"Russian stocks soar on reopening, ASX hits two month high",markets,"  Russian share market reopens after month-long closure, ASX at two month high For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Russian stocks have seen wild swings as the market reopened for limited trading after being shut down for a month, and the Australian market has risen to a two month high. Stock trading was suspended in late February after President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine and the Russian market fell by more than one-third in a day. The Moscow stock exchange resumed trading overnight for four hours in 33 Russian stocks including oil and gas giant Gazprom and Sberbank. The MOEX Russian index soared more than 10 per cent. It closed up 4.4 per cent to 2,579, with energy and mining stocks driving the gains. Bloomberg reported the fortunes of Russian tycoons linked to the top 33 companies jumped $US2.7 billion. But the Russian market is still down by nearly 30 per cent since the invasion of Ukraine. Stocks have not traded since February 25, the day after the invasion. Short selling on bonds is banned. And foreign investors will not be able to sell stocks or OFZ rouble bonds until April 1. Oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil jumped, while aluminium firm Rusal and Norilsk Nickel also increased. Airline Aeroflot fell 16.4 per cent. The Moscow Exchange will restart limited trading in more stocks, bonds and Eurobonds tonight, but trading in Russian companies on the London Stock Exchange remains suspended. ""We will do everything possible to open all segments of the stock market soon,"" Boris Blokhin from the Moscow exchange said. The White House said the reopening of the market was a ""charade"". ""This is not a real market and not a sustainable model — which only underscored Russia's isolation from the global financial system,"" deputy White House national security adviser Daleep Singh said. The reaction to the invasion sent the Russian rouble tumbling and saw sanctions imposed by Western countries and companies. The rouble rose 6.2 per cent to 94.75 against the greenback overnight. It has fallen by 20 per cent this year. German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian premier Mario Draghi and other European Union leaders told Russia to honour payments for gas exports stated in the contract, usually US dollars or euros. The war in Ukraine suddenly has shifted from the battleground to the boardroom, the bourse and banks as Russian consumers prepare to enter their very own world of pain. Mr Putin yesterday said ""unfriendly"" countries would have to pay gas contracts in roubles. Gas prices jumped after Mr Putin ordered the Russian central bank to prepare measures to force some buyers to make rouble payments for natural gas within a week. The EU is planning measures to wean itself off Russian energy. Russia supplies about 40 per cent of Europe's gas and 60 per cent of its oil. Latvia's prime minister said energy sanctions were a serious option that the EU should consider. But Belgium's Prime Minister said oil and gas sanctions on Russia would have a ""devastating impact on the European economy and I don't think it's necessary."" Mr Scholz said ending dependence on Russian oil, coal and gas ""from one day to the next would mean plunging our country and all of Europe into recession."" European gas prices fell as the US promised to supply more LNG to the EU. Brent crude fell 3 per cent overnight to $US117.89 as investors faced the prospect of higher trading costs on major exchanges, according to ANZ, with traders required to deposit more collateral. Spot gold rose nearly 1 per cent to $US1,961 an ounce. Iron ore prices increased nearly 2 per cent to $US150.75 a tonne. The Australian market lifted for the fourth day in a row to a two-month high, thanks to higher iron ore prices and a bounce back on Wall Street. While coming off its lunchtime peak, the All Ordinaries index increased by 0.3 per cent to 7,690, and the ASX 200 put on 0.26 per cent to 7,406. Mining stocks led the increases on the market, with utilities, real estate stocks, and oil stocks among the seven out of 11 sectors that rose. The big miners gained but the big banks dropped. Tech, healthcare and financial firms were weaker. The best performers on the benchmark index were BlueScope Steel (+5.1pc), brick maker Brickworks (+4.8pc) and Flight Centre (+3.8pc) after pre-travel COVID-19 tests for international arrivals were scrapped. The laggards were biotech Imugene (-5.2pc), battery materials firm Novonix (-4.5pc) and online bookmaker Pointsbet (-3.3pc). Virtus Health (-0.25pc) said its purchaser, CapVest Partners, received approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board for its takeover. The Australian dollar bought 75.12 US cents at 4:20pm AEDT, after rising to a nearly five-month high of 75.28. It is being driven by higher commodity prices and expectations of a local interest rate rise by the Reserve Bank. It rose to a six-year high against the weaker Japanese yen of 92.01, but was buying 91.32 at 4:20pm AEDT. Retailer Premier Investments said Delta lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne hurt its profit for the first half of the financial year. The owner of fashion chain Peter Alexander and children's stationery firm Smiggle saw net profit fell by 13 per cent to $163 million in the 26 weeks to January 29 as revenue slipped. Chairman Solomon Lew said the first half of fiscal 2022 was one of the most challenging and unpredictable halves of the pandemic. ""Under government mandates, stores in our largest markets were shut for most of the first quarter, equating to 42,675 trading days."" Despite that, the firm saw record online sales over the half. Its shares rose early on as investors received a record 46 cents a share interim dividend. Premier's shares closed the day down 1.6 per cent. Energy firm AGL announced it would invest $41 million with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency in its battery project in Broken Hill in outback New South Wales. The 50 megawatt Broken Hill battery is part of AGL's planned 850 megawatt grid-scale battery network under development. AGL is receiving nearly $15 million from the government agency. Its shares rose 1.3 per cent. Origin Energy said it was awaiting advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade regarding Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, who is on Australia's sanctions list. A company controlled by Mr Vekselberg has a 16 per cent stake in Falcon Oil & Gas, Origin's joint venture partner in the Beetaloo Basin in the Northern Territory. Origin executive Tim O'Grady told a parliamentary committee that the company believed it had done the right thing and would happily comply with any DFAT directives in full. ""We have no relationship at all. There is an interest by Mr Vekselberg but it is a passive interest,"" he said. Falcon said this week that Mr Vekselberg's stake had been quarantined since US sanctions were imposed in 2018. Origin shares rose 1.4 per cent. Wall Street jumped on good economic data and as investors bought the dip. The Dow Jones index put on 1 per cent to 34,708, the S&P 500 rose 1.4 per cent to 4,520, and the Nasdaq gained 1.9 per cent to 14,192. Technology stocks like Nvida and Intel boosted the market. The greenback rose for the fourth time in the past five sessions as economic data continued expectations that the US central bank would raise interest rates rapidly this year to curb inflation. Initial jobless claims fell to 187,000 last week, seasonally adjusted, the lowest since September 1969. Meanwhile, durable goods orders fell last month as shipments slowed. Bitcoin rose 3.5 per cent to $43,859. In Europe, the FTSE 100 index rose 0.1 per cent to 7,467, the DAX fell 0.07 per cent to 14,274, and the CAC 40 fell 0.4 per cent to 6,556.

23,"Russia to sell gas in roubles, ASX ekes out gain",markets,"  Russia to sell gas in roubles as sanctions bite, ASX turns positive on oil rally For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Russia says it will sell gas to some countries in roubles, and Australian shares have edged higher helped by a new surge in oil prices. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would seek payment in roubles for gas sales to ""unfriendly"" countries in response to the Western sanctions crippling Russia's economy. The world's commodity trade is usually conducted in US dollars. The Russian President's plan would further disrupt commodity markets. At a televised meeting with government ministers, Mr Putin said Russia would continue to supply natural gas in line with existing contracts. ""The changes will only affect the currency of payment, which will be changed to Russian roubles,"" Mr Putin said. Moscow has drawn up a list of unfriendly countries which includes the United States, European Union members, Britain and Japan. Russian state oil giant Gazprom has been tasked with modifying contracts. The news saw European gas prices soar as Russia supplies around 40 per cent of Europe's gas. Whether European nations will pay for gas in roubles is another question. Germany said the shift to roubles was a breach of contract, while Italy said it would likely continue payments in euros. Mr Putin's announcement also saw the rouble jumped to a one-month high against the greenback, to 87.50 US cents. Nickel prices jumped 15 per cent, to $US32,380 a tonne, and other industrial metals also increased because of disruptions from the conflict and higher energy prices. Nickel prices continue to be volatile after the price jumped to $US100,000 earlier this month. As Russia bombed the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Western leaders gathered in Brussels to plan more measures to force Russia to end its war in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden and his European counterparts will announce new sanctions against Russia. They will also discuss whether to impose further energy sanctions on Russia, and whether the US can supply LNG and hydrogen to Europe to replace Russian gas. Several nations have banned the import of Russian oil, including the US, the UK and Australia. Bloomberg has reported that Russian central bank governor Elivra Nabiullina sought to resign after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Mr Putin reportedly rejected the resignation and she was nominated for a new five-year term last week. The Russian central bank's press office told Russian state media the report ""doesn't correspond to reality"". Ms Nabiullina is highly regarded by investors as one of the world's best monetary policymakers. Oil prices jumped more than 5 per cent due to sanctions on Russia threatening fuel shortages and disrupting the oil market. There also weather related disruptions to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium pipeline on the Black Sea, which transports Russian and Kazakh crude oil exports. Russia is the world's biggest oil exporter and supplies nearly half of Europe's energy. Brent crude rose 5.4 per cent, to $US121.57 a barrel, while West Texas crude oil rose 5 per cent, to $US114.57 a barrel overnight. Brent crude neared its record high earlier this month because of the war. And local petrol prices are at record highs, driving inflation. Spot gold put on 1.3 per cent, to $US19445.42 an ounce. Oil prices edged lower in Asian trade, with Brent crude down 0.5 per cent to $US120.96 a barrel at 4:15pm AEDT. Spot gold fell 0.2 per cent to $US1,939.68 an ounce in afternoon trade. The Australian dollar gained on the rise in commodity prices, to just above 75 US cents overnight, a four-month high. It fell 0.2 per cent to 74.82 US cents at 4:30pm AEDT. The world's biggest bond investor, PIMCO, said the war had ""cast an even thicker layer of uncertainty"" on the already uncertain economic outlook. The Australian market opened lower but turned positive during the day, helped by stronger energy stocks and miners. By the close, the All Ordinaries index rose 0.05 per cent to 7,669, and the ASX 200 lifted 0.1 per cent to 7,387. Utilities, energy firms, miners and consumer staples gained, but financial firms, healthcare and technology stocks weighed on the market. Crown Resorts was found to be unsuitable to hold a casino licence in Perth by the Perth Casino Royal Commission because it facilitated money laundering and criminal activity. However, the commission did not recommend that Crown be stripped of its casino licence. Instead, an independent manager will be appointed to oversee all of its operations comply with regulations. That move boosted Crown (+0.2pc) shares. Crown said it would review the report and would work co-operatively and constructively with the Western Australian government. Crown chief executive Steve McCann said the company was committed to continuous improvement across all its resorts, including Crown Perth. ""This includes investment in people, systems, processes, culture and a sharp focus on responsible gaming and the prevention of financial crime."" Crown has replaced most of its board and management over the past year as it seeks to hold onto its gaming licences. Westpac is the latest of the big four banks to reduce standard variable home loan rates. Westpac cut its variable rate by 0.1 per cent, to 2.09 per cent, for people with a 30 per cent deposit, making it the lowest variable rate of the big four. RateCity said St George and the Bank of Melbourne were offering a 2.04 per cent rate for borrowers with a 40 per cent deposit. Fixed home loan rates have continued to rise because of increasing borrowing costs Westpac lifted its one- to five-year rates for owner occupiers and investors by up to 0.3 per cent. It raised its three-year fixed rate from 3.44 per cent to 3.74 per cent, increasing the repayment on a $500,000 loan by $84 a month. The rate was 1.88 per cent a year ago. ANZ has carried out the first payment by an Australian bank-issued $A stablecoin through a blockchain transaction. This A$DC payment was made by investment firm Victor Smorgon Group, through its stake in the Zerocap platform, which invests in digital and technology assets like cryptocurrency. The investment firm did not have to convert Australian dollars to US dollars to do the transaction. Zerocap said $30 million A$DC was transferred from ANZ to Zerocap ""in seconds"". A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency with a value linked to a commodity, currency or algorithm to manage supply. The Reserve Bank is looking at issuing a central bank digital coin. ANZ head of banking services Nigel Dobson said the bank-issued stablecoin was a first and important step to enable customers to safely and securely use digital transactions. ""Stablecoins are a new way for customers to transact and, in this case, was an efficient and direct way for Victor Smorgon Group to access Zerocap's digital asset exchange and move funds across a decentralised network,"" he said. ANZ also launched a new digital banking service called ANZ Plus. Bitcoin rose 1.4 per cent to $US42,976 at 4:45pm AEDT.

Brickworks reported a record net profit of $581 million, with demand for building products driving the result. The electronics retailer JB Hifi said increased customer demand and strong sales growth drove an 11 per cent rise in sales over the first few months of the year. Telecommunications firm Uniti Group (-0.6pc)  lost ground, despite confirming it had received a higher takeover bid from Macquarie Group and Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Investment house Washington H. Soul Pattinson (+1.3pc) made a net loss of $643 million for the first half of 2022, compared to a profit the year earlier.

Prices in the United Kingdom surged to a new 30-year high of 6.2 per cent — more than expected.

24,Evergrande says it is on track to restructuring after shares suspended and billions seized by banks ,markets,"  Evergrande says it is on track to restructuring after shares suspended and billions seized by banks For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Embattled Chinese developer Evergrande has assured investors it will unveil a debt restructuring proposal for its creditors by the end of July, after concerns about its financial health were renewed by a delay in publishing its annual results. Evergrande, whose $US22.7 billion ($30.5 billion) worth of offshore debt is deemed to be in default, is seeking to ""further enhance communications"" with creditors to reach the end-of-July target, its executive director Shawn Siu told investors on a call. Earlier on Tuesday, Evergrande said in a stock exchange filing it would not meet a March 31 deadline to file its financial results for 2021 because audit work had not been completed. The world's most indebted property developer, Evergrande told investors in January it aimed to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place within six months. A wave of defaults in China's property sector has rattled investors and while state intervention has quelled market concern over a disorderly collapse of Evergrande, investors are still in the dark over whether they will recoup their money. Troubled Chinese property giant Evergrande's shares have been suspended from trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer and now reeling under more than $400 billion in liabilities, defaulted on some overseas bond payments in December and has struggled to repay suppliers and creditors and complete projects and homes. The developer set up a risk management committee in December made up mostly of members from state enterprises, as the Guangdong provincial government is leading the restructuring. ""With the broad support and understanding from the majority of creditors … we strive to release the preliminary restructuring proposal by the end of July,"" Chen Yong, a member of the committee, told investors on Tuesday night. As part of its plans to divest assets to repay some of its offshore debt, the developer is working to sell its Yuen Long land parcel in Hong Kong as well as the Evergrande Centre commercial building, said Evergrande board member Liang Senlin. Trading in shares of Evergrande, its property services unit Evergrande Property Services Group, and electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group, have been suspended since Monday. Mr Liang said on the investor call that the developer was trying to rope in strategic investors in both the electric vehicle (EV) and property services units to restore value — a goal it has been pursuing for roughly a year without much success. Mr Siu said the EV unit aimed to start mass production in June of its inaugural electric car, the Hengchi 5 sport-utility vehicle, after getting approval to start sales last week. Some of the investors who attended the call were not impressed with the assurances from management. ""They mainly explained why the trading of stocks is suspended,"" said a bondholder who was on the call, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media. ""There was no new information and the situation remained the same."" Earlier on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Evergrande planned to return land used as collateral for a trust loan to the Guangzhou government, providing a model for local authority involvement that could be replicated for other indebted Chinese property firms. Once a symbol of glittering success, China's biggest property group is tanking, dragging many of its competitors with it, writes Ian Verrender. The deal centres around a 3.25 billion yuan ($685.4 million) trust loan that CITIC Trust issued to Evergrande using funds raised from investors, according to the sources and a document reviewed by Reuters partially outlining the plan. Under the plans, CITIC will return the land used as collateral to Evergrande, which will then pass it on to the Guangzhou city government to put up for sale, the sources said. State-owned Guangzhou City Construction Investment Group will act as a guarantor of the loan and CITIC will repay the principal amount to its investors within two years using funds from the Guangzhou city government, the sources said. The plan is still pending approval from the investors of the trust loan, one of the people said. If successfully implemented, this model of local government and creditors working together to resolve Evergrande's debt repayment issue could be replicated for other trust loans, analysts said, and more state-owned city investment companies may become involved in the firm's debt restructuring process. Evergrande, CITIC and Guangzhou City Construction Investment did not respond to requests for comment. Trust companies, which pool money from wealthy investors, are an important source of funding for Evergrande and other property developers in China. In a separate filing on Tuesday, Evergrande said its Property Services Group had launched an investigation into how banks seized 13.4 billion yuan ($2.82 billion) in deposits that had been pledged as security for third-party guarantees. The seizure of the funds, which the property services unit discovered when it was preparing its annual report, underscores the turmoil at Evergrande, which said it would hire King & Wood Mallesons as an additional legal adviser.
