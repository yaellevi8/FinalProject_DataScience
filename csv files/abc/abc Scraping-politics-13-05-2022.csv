0,The diabolically simple question that tripped Morrison,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Today brings the end of Week Five, and confirmation that the Prime Minister has reached the bargaining phase in the crushing 360-degree employee review that this campaign has become. These moments are never easy to witness. Here's how it happened. In the at-risk Victorian Liberal electorate of Chisholm, whither the PM had repaired to fiddle with motherboards at a tech factory and wax lyrical about the Member for Chisholm, Gladys Liu, in front of an underwhelmed-looking cohort of lab-coated employees, the PM assumed the position for his daily press conference. Sky News reporter Andrea Crothers — part of the travelling media pack well accustomed to the PM's fondness for avowing what ""Australians know"" to be true — slipped in a diabolically simple question. ""Prime Minister, isn't part of your problem that you keep telling them what they know, rather than listening?"" Now, asking Scott Morrison a question is easy. Getting an answer is harder. And more often than not, you get the answer to the question the PM would have liked you to ask, rather than the one you actually did. And in this case, he started out by explaining that Australians know him for his strength and decisiveness during the pandemic. A classic interview manoeuvre from the ""What's my weakness? Oh, I guess it's probably that I'm a workaholic"" job interview school. But having started talking, he somehow couldn't stop. ""I know [that] Australians know I can be a bit of a bulldozer when it comes to issues,"" he confided. For a man who loves to be photographed hard-hattedly astride various pieces of heavy machinery, the revelation that to some extent he actually identifies as a vehicle feels… significant. But it didn't stop there, either. ""As we go into this next period on the other side of the pandemic, I know things that are going to have to change with the way I do things,"" Mr Morrison continued. For the entire time he's been in office, Mr Morrison's entire offering has been incumbency. ""I'm the Prime Minister,"" he likes to remind people. As of today, however, he's prepared to be a different kind of guy, if we'll just give him another chance. A clearly thrilled Anthony Albanese, in Cairns, found himself 10 yards out and dead in front of the sticks. Not always, with this player, an absolute guarantee of points, but today he did not miss, booting two in quick succession. ""A bulldozer knocks things over,"" said the Labor leader. ""I'm a builder, that's what I am. If I'm elected prime minister, I will build things in this country. ""This government has been there for almost a decade, this prime minister has four years in office, and what he's saying is, 'If you vote for Scott Morrison, I'll change'. ""That's what he's saying. 'Vote for me and I'll change'. Well, if you want change, change the government."" Late-campaign handbrake turns are extremely tricky to pull off. In 2007, keen to repair the damage from a botched cabinet assassination attempt against John Howard, Howard and his grumpy deputy Peter Costello granted a joint interview to Today Tonight to demonstrate that they had a new and warm relationship. It was fascinatingly awkward, and of course did not work. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. The worst damage to the Prime Minister from today isn't that people now think any worse of him or will forever picture him staring at himself in the mirror of a morning and softly saying ""Brrrooooommmm"". It's that to a messy and disjointed prime ministerial campaign that so far has been about jobs, but also China, but also dentists, but also who's allowed to play in the girls' team, you can now add an exciting new discussion about how the PM is planning to change and why. A shocker. It's why when asking our daily question about who had a Good Day and who had a Bad Day, the answer for Friday, May 13 is — in order – Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison. It's odd to call it an election launch when more than a million people will have already voted and it's less than a week until the big day, but that's exactly what Scott Morrison and the Coalition has in front of it this Sunday. While Labor held their launch in Perth, the Liberals stumped up for Brisbane — not ideal when the city is struggling with heavy downpours and flooding for the umpteenth time this year.

1,SA Police investigating racist flyers dispersed by right-wing groups,politics,"  SA Police investigating racist flyers dispersed by right-wing groups in suburban Adelaide For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The distribution of racist and white supremacist propaganda to Adelaide homes is being investigated by police, amid reports of letterbox drops of material in the lead-up to the federal election. Residents in parts of Adelaide have reported receiving flyers from the neo-Nazi group European Australian Movement, which include a call to action and racist messaging. SA Police previously warned about growing right-wing activity, saying groups on the far right had been emboldened by the COVID-19 pandemic and regarded backlash against social restrictions as a recruiting opportunity. A spokesperson said that while SA Police respected ""the right of individuals to have different beliefs in a democratic country"", it was concerned about instances of groups ""inciting people to commit violence"". ""SAPOL is investigating the distribution of flyers in Adelaide from groups who allegedly espouse right-wing ideologies,"" a police spokesperson said. ""These groups are being closely monitored. SAPOL thoroughly investigates any reports of individuals or groups who, through their ideology or beliefs, seek to incite violence within the community. ""This applies equally to religious-based or ideological-based violence."" Last month, Police Commissioner Grant Stevens acknowledged that police were keeping ""an eye on"" several ""persons of interest"", adding that much of the activity was confined to online chat groups and forums. ""That's not to say that we don't have people who come together and meet and share their views and ideologies in person, and physically,"" he said. ""Some of them pretend to be fellowship groups or like-minded individuals who come together to socialise, but there's an undercurrent of right-wing radicalisation about that. It's very hard to put a number on [them]. ""It's something that is probably growing in terms of its prevalence, compared to other issues that we would normally have looked at."" Commissioner Stevens said that police kept across various information channels, including ""community sources, online forums [and] media scrapings"". ""We have highly specialised police officers, intelligence officers and analysts [who] work in this particular field,"" he said. Police have urged anyone with information to contact the National Security Hotline, on 1800 123 400, or Crime Stoppers, on 1800 333 000. Attorney-General Kyam Maher yesterday raised the possibility of South Australia following Victoria's lead and banning the display of the swastika as a Nazi hate symbol. Last year, the Victorian government announced it would make the public display of Nazi iconography illegal. ""What we're doing now is looking at what laws we have in South Australia, to see if there are laws that cover this,"" Mr Maher told ABC Radio Adelaide. ""There was a lot of consultation in Victoria on this, a 12-month education campaign before their laws come into force and the $22,000 fine starts applying."" Mr Maher said that, while police had not reported a rise ""in the use of the Nazi hate symbol using the swastika"", they had observed a rise in the number of individuals with ""ideologically motivated violent extremist views"". Banning the swastika has also been considered in NSW, although a parliamentary inquiry considering the matter was told by a senior police officer the move could backfire by creating a ""certain mystique"" around the symbol. However, Mr Maher said, the swastika was, when used by neo-Nazis, ""such a symbol of hate"" that it was ""not appropriate"" for public display. He added that there were reasons to allow exemptions, including for ""use in educational or artistic settings"". ""The symbol the swastika has a very long and sacred history with a number of groups and faiths, including the Buddhist and Hindu faiths, as a symbol of peace and good fortune,"" he said. ""We'd want to make sure that, if we did introduce laws like they have in Victoria, that these things are allowed.""

2,Major parties back return of $455-a-day charge to some people in immigration detention,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Coalition wants to resurrect a Howard-era immigration policy, and charge many of the people residing in immigration detention hundreds of dollars a day for being there. The policy would apply to people awaiting deportation on character grounds, particularly convicted criminals who are not Australian citizens. Federal Labor has indicated it is supportive of the idea, despite its national policy platform indicating it is opposed to cost recovery from detainees. Under the policy, detainees subject to the fees would be charged $456.23 per day. Some detainees spend years in immigration detention pursuing various avenues of appeal, meaning they could run up significant debts. The previous policy, which was primarily being applied to asylum seekers, was scrapped by the Rudd government in 2009 for everyone except illegal fishers and people smugglers. At the time, the then-Labor government argued it was both punitive and ineffectual, as very little of the debt being incurred was ever collected. The costs of running the scheme were either higher than, or even with, the revenue brought in. Between mid-2006 and mid-2008, about $54 million in debt was accrued, but just under $2 million was collected. Questioned on Friday morning, Prime Minister Scott Morrison argued it was better than nothing. ""That's $2 million more than there was before,"" he said. ""That's why it's important, it sends a very strong message. ""If you come and commit a crime in this country, and you're not a citizen, you'll go to jail. When you get out you'll be in detention, and then you'll be sent home."" Immigration experts say any return to the policy of levying fees on those in immigration detention will likely incur the same problems the policy faced pre-2009: That is, the debts are very hard to collect. Former senior Immigration Department official Abul Rizvi said that trying to gather money off non-citizens abroad was hard work. ""Most of the debts are incurred by people who have been deported from Australia,"" he said. ""And there is no legal basis on which we can actually pursue and force them to repay. ""And, as a result, we rarely made the effort to try to get the money back."" He said it was hard to see how the policy might be more successful now. ""I still see no evidence that it will actually increase debt collection,"" he said. ""It'll increase, in my view, administrative effort but not much more."" Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. It is understood the policy would be targeted towards people the government views as having the capacity to pay debts, particularly those with Australian-based assets. Refugee activist Ian Rintoul said the policy appeared designed to discourage detainees from pursuing legal appeals, as they would face an ever-growing debt. ""The one thing it will do is very, very likely influence people who are being detained — awaiting deportation on character grounds — from perhaps exercising their appeal rights,"" he said. ""Because it means [that], every day that they are in detention — even if they're going through the legal procedures that are available to them — they'll be racking up debt."" Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said those facing deportation should be leaving the country, not challenging their deportation in court. ""People need to consider very carefully, when they've come to Australia on a temporary visa as a privilege, and then violated our laws with a very serious offence, they should leave our country,"" he said. ""We don't expect them to sue us and continue to try [to] challenge that after their conviction. ""And, yes, we will seize your assets and recover [debts] under a re-elected Morrison government, if we can.""

3,"As a 12yo student, Sam was told to 'stop' relationship with sexually abusive teacher",politics,"  Commission of inquiry hears 12yo student was told to 'stop' relationship with sexually abusive teacher For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Some 36 years after he was sexually abused by one of his high school teachers, Sam Leishman stood up in a courtroom and read a statement, detailing the impact it had had on him. CONTENT WARNING: This story contains details that may cause distress. It was a turning point for him. No longer was he a terrified young boy who did not understand what was happening. ""I was nervous about it. I was told to bring some support along and I didn't because I thought, 'Oh, I'll just throw up or start crying or wet myself or something. I'll just make a fool of myself', so I just went along on my own with my statement,"" Mr Leishman told the Tasmanian child sexual abuse commission of inquiry on Friday. ""I remember standing up before the judge and the court … [and] I suddenly felt like the biggest person in the room. ""I felt like the biggest person in the room because I was there standing up in front of everyone, including him, speaking up for the child that I once was and I felt that that had never been done before."" Mr Leishman was a 12-year-old student at New Town High when he was repeatedly sexually abused by a teacher he admired, Darrel George Harington, in the late 1970s. When other boys at the school found out he was spending time with Harington, one said to him: ""How did it feel to suck Harington's cock last night?"" That was the start of bullying that left him isolated and made his high school years a misery. ""A few days later, one of the other teachers in my school took me aside, and the words effectively were, 'I don't know what's going on between you and Mr Harington, but obviously something is and you need to make it stop',"" Mr Leishman told the commission. ""You were given the responsibility of stopping it?"" Commission president Marcia Neave asked. ""Yes,"" Mr Leishman replied. He told the commission about being terrified his parents would find out, and about how Harington had gained his parents' trust. It was not until much later in life, however, that Mr Leishman realised that what happened to him was child sexual abuse. He was 48 years old, feeling down about things that had been happening in his life, and, as he said he always did when he was feeling down, he thought back to what happened to him when he was 12. ""[I] blamed everything that was happening in my life now to events going all the way back to when I was 12,"" he said. On the news that night, Mr Leishman saw then-prime minister Julia Gillard give an update on the work of the national child sexual abuse royal commission. It was a ""light bulb moment"" for him, Mr Leishman said, and, out of curiosity, he started reading statements on the royal commission's website. ""I was just staggered because, by that stage, there [were] volumes and volumes and volumes of work that [the royal commission] had done, and story after story, and I started reading through them, and I thought, 'Shit, that happened to me',"" he said. Mr Leishman engaged with the royal commission and, during that process, he was contacted by police and he discovered that other children had also been abused by Harington. In 2015, Harington pleaded guilty to — and was jailed for — the sexual abuse of several boys in the 1970s, '80s and '90s. However, Mr Leishman's story did not end there. He thought the state's Education Department would want to talk to him, to understand how Harington's abuse was able to happen. He also had questions of his own. ""I wanted to know why he was teaching at my school, what other complaints they had about him, who knew what,"" he said. He wrote to then-education minister Jeremy Rockliff in 2015, asking for a meeting, but it took two years before a meeting was arranged with the department's deputy secretary for learning. Mr Leishman said that, during that meeting, he felt he was ""to some degree being listened to"". As for his own questions, Mr Leishman said he felt ""completely stymied"" by the process for getting information. Right to Information became impossible for him because he needed Harington's permission to release some of the information. The Commission of Inquiry was announced to investigate the Tasmanian government's responses to child sexual abuse in state institutions — here's what we've heard from the public hearings so far. He said he had also been unable to access information about himself and his time at school. Education Department secretary Tim Bullard — who also appeared before the commission on Friday — said Mr Leishman's evidence had made him feel ""personally very sad, for a number of reasons"". ""I think Mr Leishman's courage in revealing the betrayal of trust that happened to him as a result of an association that was made whilst he was in one of our schools is very confronting to hear, but then there's the barriers that existed when he came forward with an expectation that he would seek, and receive, support or acknowledgement from the Department of Education,"" Mr Bullard said. ""[That] also makes me feel very disappointed and I have apologised to Mr Leishman and I'm very sorry, I'm very sorry for that. ""One of the things that Mr Leishman's experience has provided us with is yet another example of where, for whatever reason, there has been a systemic failing to put victim-survivors at the centre of decisions."" Mr Leishman ended his evidence with his hope that the recommendations to come from the commission of inquiry are taken seriously and implemented in a timely manner. ""We talk about Tasmania as being a small jurisdiction and a small island … we don't have the resources and how difficult all of that is,"" he said. ""Why can't we look at Tasmania as being a small, isolated state and that's actually our advantage? ""We are small, we can set the standards and we can be the one that says, 'This is the benchmark that everyone else has to meet' … there's no reason why we can't do things better here than the rest of the country.""

4,SA corrections department agrees to drop ban on political newspaper in prisons,politics,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency South Australian prisoners will be allowed to receive a redacted version of a political newspaper ahead of the federal election, under an agreement reached with the Department for Correctional Services. The four-page ""Just Us"" newspaper contains information about prisoner rights and eligibility to vote, and articles outlining the policies of political parties. It has been produced by the Justice Action advocacy group since 2004 and is distributed to prisons across the country. But its circulation was this year barred in South Australia. Lawyers for Justice Action last week brought a legal challenge in an attempt to overturn the decision. The Supreme Court this morning heard the parties had reached an out-of-court agreement that will allow a redacted version of the publication to be distributed to prisoners. Prisoner advocate and Justice Action coordinator Brett Collins said the newspaper supported prisoners' democratic rights. ""This is the newspaper that allows people in prison to read about what the political parties have to say – it's as simple as that,"" he said. ""This newspaper had gone into every jurisdiction in Australia, except South Australia."" In SA, prisoners serving a sentence under three years are entitled to vote in elections. The Corrections Department did not provide reasons for the ban to the ABC last week, but in a letter published on the Justice Action website, the department's chief executive David Brown said the newsletter contained ""proactive and inflammatory material"". Mr Collins said there had been concerns about the inclusion of a motto ""Jailing is Failing"". ""The CEO said this would be likely to inflame or incite prisoners to cause unrest inside the jail,"" he said. ""That's absolutely ridiculous. ""We were shocked, really surprised and disappointed that the approach in South Australian corrections was so bad."" Mr Brown's letter also refers to material that aimed at ""facilitating relationships between prisoners and persons who are not prisoners, contrary to regulation 11(2)"". Mr Collins said contact details for political parties and other organisations, and some references to COVID-19, would also be removed from the publication. He said he believed contact details to be ""crucial"" to prisoners' participation in the election, but said the organisation decided to ""let it go"" because the ""paper is too important"". ""They've now guaranteed every prisoner in South Australia will get a copy of the paper and we're going to reprint the paper for them,"" Mr Collins said. In a statement, a Department for Correctional Services spokeswoman said: ""We are pleased we've been able to reach an outcome that reflects the department's commitment that only acceptable materials will be permitted to be distributed to prisoners. ""We remain committed to ensuring that all eligible prisoners are able to vote and have access to mandatory voting material for the upcoming election.""

5,"Chinese spy ship detected off Western Australia, near secretive naval facility, Dutton says ",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A high-tech Chinese surveillance ship has been tracked off the West Australian coast, close to a secretive naval communications base that supports American and other allied submarines. Defence Minister Peter Dutton has revealed the auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) vessel was closely monitored by the ADF as it sailed past the Harold E Holt naval station at Exmouth. Mr Dutton said Australia had been tracking the spy ship in the past ""week or so"" but didn't put an exact date on the surveillance. ""Its intent, of course, is to collect intelligence right along the coastline,"" he said. ""It has been in close proximity to military and intelligence installations on the west coast of Australia."" The Defence Minister, who described the situation as unprecedented, said he was concerned not just at how far south the ship had travelled but also that it had ""hugged"" the coastline as it headed back north towards Darwin. He dubbed the matter ""very strange"" and said he expected the ship was collecting as much intelligence as it could. Shadow Defence Minister Brendan O'Connor said Labor ""shares concerns"" that the Chinese are conducting surveillance operations off Australia's west coast. ""We note a concerning pattern of behaviour from the PLA Navy of intelligence ships entering Australia economic exclusive zone,"" Mr O'Connor said in a statement. Mr O'Connor added that he had a preliminary conversation with Mr Dutton and has sought ""a more comprehensive briefing"". Mr Dutton denied that he was making the revelation to stoke national security fears and to woo votes ahead of the May 21 federal election. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the ship's proximity to Australia was a reminder of the geo-strategic reality. ""They'll keep a close eye on us and I can assure you, Australia, in our national interest, will always be keeping a close eye on them,"" Mr Morrison said. The Prime Minister did not repeat Mr Dutton's claim this was an act of aggression. ""I certainly don't believe that when you take it together with the many coercive acts and the many statements that have been made attacking Australia's nation interest, you could describe it as an act of bridge-building or friendship,"" Mr Morrison said. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Scott Morrison accused a Chinese warship of a ""reckless and irresponsible act"" after a laser was shone at an RAAF aircraft as it approached Australia's northern shoreline. Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews has suggested the ship's journey may have been deliberately timed to coincide with the election campaign. ""I think you have always got to question what the timing is,"" Ms Andrews said. ""We all understand that China is very strategic and is very careful about what it does, when it does it, and how it does it."" When asked if he had travelled to Western Australia to make the announcement, Mr Dutton declined to say, citing ""operational reasons"". ""I think people understand the difficulty, the reality, of the Indo-Pacific at the moment, the acts of aggression from the Chinese leadership and from the Chinese government,"" he said. ""I think Australians deserve to know what is taking place and it is a repeat of a previous practice where we have made the public aware of these activities before."" The ABC last year revealed the Defence Department had scrapped a contentious proposal to use private security personnel to guard Harold E Holt Naval Communications Station, one of the nation's most secretive and important military facilities.

6,"Scott Morrison makes a late campaign strategy shift, acknowledging he's been a 'bulldozer'",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Liberal Party is so acutely conscious of Scott Morrison's unpopularity that its pitch to voters has been crafted to accommodate it. ""It's not a popularity test,"" Mr Morrison said at the outset of the six-week long election campaign. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. ""You go to the dentist, it doesn't matter if you like him or not. You want to know they're good at their job."" Having your teeth drilled into is a particularly unpleasant experience to compare your leadership to, but it was an effort to suggest skill and hardiness are more important for a Prime Minister than likeability. ""You may not like everything we've done, you may not like me that much, but that's not the point,"" he said at the time. It was an analogy used by colleagues, too, particularly Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, who has returned to the comparison of his colleague to a physically painful procedure several times. Given just a year ago he was calling Mr Morrison a ""hypocrite"" and a ""liar"" in private text messages, one might presume Mr Joyce doesn't much like going to the dentist. But the Prime Minister has changed his tune as he enters the final week of the campaign, trailing in the polls and momentum swinging behind Labor. ""I know (that) Australians know I can be a bit of a bulldozer when it comes to issues,"" he conceded. ""As we go into this next period on the other side of the pandemic, I know things that are going to have to change with the way I do things."" A promise to change, if given the chance, ""because we're moving into a different time, a time of opportunity."" In campaign terms, it is a tectonic shift. With eight days to go until the May 21 poll, the appeal for voters to stick with a known quantity has been re-cast as a vow to transform anew. The Scott Morrison of the last three years will be different to the Scott Morrison in the years ahead, he offers. Labor sees not a dentist, nor a bulldozer, but a leopard that will not be capable of changing its spots. ""If you want change, change the government,"" Anthony Albanese said, pouncing on the Prime Minister's words scarcely an hour after he uttered them. ""Don't look for Scott Morrison to change, because that's not going to happen. Just change the government."" Said with a gusto that has often missing from the Labor leader's stump speeches, Mr Albanese leant into the Prime Minister's words. ""A bulldozer wrecks things, a bulldozer knocks things over. I'm a builder, that's what I am. And if I'm elected Prime Minister, I'll build things in this country."" Labor's campaign headquarters was just as quick to capitalise on the comments on social media. They've both spent their lives in politics but come May 21, one will be prime minister and the other will likely face the end of their political career. A long, six-week campaign was a deliberate choice by the Liberal Party, knowing the maximum amount of time was needed to make the case for a fourth term in office. Throughout, Mr Morrison has carefully calibrated his words, his tone and his focus in an effort to work with, rather than challenge, impressions of his character. To alter the strategy so drastically, and so late, in the campaign suggests a desperation at campaign headquarters. The dial isn't shifting for Scott Morrison. Until now, the election contest has been characterised as between a man that people don't know and a man that people don't like. Now, it is between a man whose election would instantly bring change and a man who is promising to change himself, if just given one more chance.

7,"Nationals hit back over robocall complaint, citing rival's use of jaffa cakes to woo voters",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A Nationals' robocall attacking an independent challenger is being investigated by authorities, over a lengthy silence inserted between the ad and its authorisation. The improperly authorised message, targeted at voters in the Victorian seat of Nicholls, attacks independent candidate Rob Priestly. ""You've heard a lot about Rob Priestly, but have you heard where he stands on really important issues,"" the advertisement begins. ""Issues like the defence of our nation, like our relationship with China and issues like border protection and whether he supports higher taxes?"" ""And why won't Rob Priestly say who he will support in the event of a hung parliament? What's he got to hide?"" After the voice message concludes, the call contains 10 seconds of ""dead air"", before finally running the authorisation message which reveals the advertisement is from the National Party. ANALYSIS: Catch-up on the latest from the campaign trail on Friday with Annabel Crabb In a statement, Nationals Victorian state director Matthew Harris said: ""These calls raise legitimate questions that the so-called independent has failed to answer during the campaign. ""People are voting on the future of our community and our country, and the voters of Nicholls deserve to know the consequences of their vote."" Mr Harris alleged that volunteers for Mr Priestly were soliciting votes by handing out mandarins, Jaffa Cakes and other baked goods at pre-poll booths, in contravention of electoral law. He said an email had been sent to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) seeking clarification regarding section 326 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, which, he wrote, ""relates to 'Bribery' and prohibits the solicitation of votes for a candidate by the offer of a 'benefit of any kind'."" In relation to the robocall, the AEC told the ABC that the ad in that form contained an ""invalid"" authorisation, and it was investigating. ""[The authorisation] should appear at the beginning not the end, and we note the pause in the recording,"" the AEC said in a statement. ""We are looking at this matter and will be contacting the entity."" On paper, Nicholls is a safe Nationals seat held on a 20 per cent margin, but current MP Damian Drum is retiring at this election. The Nationals and Liberals are both running candidates in a crowded field of 11, and Rob Priestly is regarded as the strongest challenger to the parties. Mr Priestly is a councillor with the Greater Shepparton City Council and has been deputy mayor. He has the support of Suzanna Sheed, the MP for the overlapping state seat of Shepparton, and Cathy McGowan, who held the neighbouring federal seat of Indi as an independent. In a statement, Rob Priestly said several members of the community had contacted him about the call. ""[The Nationals'] Nicholls candidate, Sam Birrell, either needs to own or disown it,"" Mr Priestly said.

8,Melissa's home has flooded three times this year. She says a buy-back scheme is her 'only ticket to moving on',politics,"  Maryborough residents seek flood relief, roads closed in Gladstone Region, but farmers welcome rain For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency For the third time this year, Melissa Stanley is anxiously watching the Mary River rise as record-breaking rain continues to fall across the Wide Bay region. The Maryborough resident is one of thousands of flood-affected Queenslanders who will be applying for the state government's $741 million Resilient Homes Fund, to access grants to raise, repair or retrofit their homes, or have them voluntarily bought back. ""We'll be straight onto that link to apply to get into that list, because we don't sleep. We don't know if the water is coming up while we're sleeping,"" Ms Stanley said. Floodwaters reached the roof of her Maryborough home in both January and February this year, leaving the house she shares with her mother uninhabitable. They have been renting accommodation from their neighbour, but the family remains living in flood territory. ""We're constantly checking the BOM, we walk down pretty much every hour to check the river to see if it has come up any further,"" Ms Stanley said. ""We've already evacuated all of our stuff from our property to higher ground because we just don't know."" Ms Stanley says the voluntary buy-back scheme is her only hope for recovery. ""The buy-back scheme will be the only ticket to moving on. There is no retrofitting our house, there's no lifting it,"" she said. ""For our property to be out of the flood zone, we'd have to lift the house four and a half metres above the ground — that's a long way up."" LIVE UPDATES: Read our blog for the latest news on the Queensland floods With the funding to be split across Gympie and the South-East, the member for Maryborough, Bruce Saunders, says Wide Bay residents will have to fight to get their share. ""It's a good scheme, but we've got to get people to register first,"" Mr Saunders said. ""You've got to really fight to make sure no-one from Maryborough who has been affected by the floodwaters is disadvantaged."" With parts of Queensland already receiving more than their May average rainfall and more forecast to come, Mr Saunders said local governments needed to change the way they looked at housing. ""The climate is changing, the weather patterns are changing, and I think local governments have got to step up instead of mass building houses now,' he said. ""We have got to look at where we're building the houses now, and making sure that when it is built, it is resilient."" Heavy rainfalls are stretching from Rockhampton to the border, encapsulating most of the Wide Bay Burnett. Moderate flood warnings are current for the Burnett, Kolan and Mary River catchments and for Baffle Creek. The Gladstone Region has felt the impact of heavy rainfalls overnight, with up to 200mm recorded in parts of the Baffle Creek and Kolan River systems. Gladstone's Deputy Mayor Kahn Goodluck said it had resulted in up to 20 road closures across the region including the Bruce Highway north of Gin Gin. ""Essendean Bridge is under and Eulalia Bridge is under in the Baffle Creek/Deepwater area,"" Cr Goodluck said. ""The road is cut off between Bundbaberg and Agnes Water, and we've got Fingerboard Road between Miriam Vale and Agnes Water under."" The Bureau of Meteorology said the Baffle Creek catchment was likely to exceed the moderate flood levels and reach heights of 10 metres, similar to that seen in the 2017 April foods. Further inland to the North Burnett, the falls have been drought breaking. Colston Lake dairy farmer Robbie Radel says areas which missed out during the wet season are now seeing some generous falls. ""At Colston Lakes where we are, we certainly have not had the huge rain that has been around this season,"" Mr Radel said. ""We have had just on 350mm of rain for our wet season up until the start of this event. Whereas Biggenden, which is only 15 or 20 minutes away, has had in the vicinity of 900mm. ""I've got a feeling that we might get quite wet as this [rain] continues to make its way through."" Rainfall figures since 9am yesterday in the North Burnett include 74 millimetres at Eidsvold, 86mm at Mount Gayndah and 112mm at Mount Perry. The North Burnett's flood declaration was revoked on Wednesday. ""It's certainly been some beautiful rain leading into winter, which is certainly something we're not used to,"" Mr Radel said. ""Looking at the big picture, I don't think there will be too many people disappointed with the rain. ""It will allow them to get a winter crop in off the back of the crop that they've just had."" Mr Radel said the rainfall was welcomed for a number of reasons. ""I spoke with a gentleman at Mundubbera yesterday afternoon who said they are catching 1,000 mice a day through traps just around the outside of the house,"" he said. ""They're certainly hoping this rain event will wipe them out."" ABC Wide Bay will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Thursday. Sign up here.

9,"Natasha Fyles sworn in as Northern Territory Chief Minister, replacing Michael Gunner",politics,"  Natasha Fyles sworn in as Northern Territory Chief Minister, replacing Michael Gunner For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Natasha Fyles has become the Northern Territory’s 12th Chief Minister after the shock resignation of Michael Gunner earlier this week. Ms Fyles, 43, was sworn in as Chief Minister at Government House this afternoon following a Labor caucus meeting this morning where she was selected as the party's new leader. Ms Fyles said she had been selected ""as the unanimous choice"" by the Labor caucus. ""This morning I asked my caucus colleagues to support me as the new leader for Territory Labor, and they have given me their support,"" she said. ""I have been selected as the unanimous choice as leader for Territory Labor. ""I want to thank my colleagues for their support today, for the way we have conducted ourselves as a team this week. We've had passionate but respectful discussions. ""We have each put our views forward, but we have stuck together, and we will continue to do so. ""We've sorted this out quickly. We are going to keep our focus on the real job, the job of delivering for Territorians."" Ms Fyles said she first joined the Labor party in 1993 and was proud to be elected Territory Labor leader. ""I've put my hand up to serve because I love this place. I want to work every day to make it better,"" she said. ""I've been in parliament for nearly a decade. I've served on the opposition frontbench, as a cabinet minister and as Leader of Government Business. I'm ready for this job and I will hit the ground running."" Ms Fyles said the party's focus would remain on creating jobs, growing the economy and tackling the Northern Territory's social challenges. She said ""it was a bit of a shock"" to be selected as Northern Territory's Chief Minister, after Mr Gunner resigned suddenly on Tuesday. ""It's been a big week. When I was standing on the sidelines at soccer last week, out at Bagot Oval, I certainly didn't expect the week to end this way,"" she said. ""It's a bit of a shock, but it's an absolute privilege. I do not take this responsibility lightly."" Ms Fyles also thanked Mr Gunner for his work in the position, which he has held for nearly six years. ""[Mr Gunner] served the Territory well. He put his heart and soul into the job, and we are grateful that our government can continue to count on his experience and advice,"" she said. Ms Fyles said the government's ministry would remain the same for the next week during parliamentary sittings, before a new cabinet is sworn in. It means Ms Manison will remain as the Deputy Chief Minister, however Ms Fyles would not say if she would continue in the position after next week's cabinet reshuffle. The selection of Ms Fyles means the party does not have to take the vote of its rank-and-file membership — a process that could have taken the party up to four weeks. Labor ministers had expressed optimism the party would come out of the caucus meeting with a new leader during the week. But in the lead up, speculation had mounted Ms Fyles, Police Minister Nicole Manison and Member for Johnston Joel Bowden could all contest the leadership, forcing weeks of political uncertainty. Ms Fyles is the Leader of Government Business and has been the NT Health Minister since 2016, and was the Attorney-General between 2016 and 2020. She was first elected to parliament in 2012 and was promoted to the frontbench after Labor's landslide win in 2016. After nearly six years in the top job, Michael Gunner has stepped down as the Northern Territory Chief Minister. Look back the key events that shaped his time in power. As Health Minister, she has been a highly visible presence throughout the pandemic along with Mr Gunner and NT Chief Health Officer Hugh Heggie. Following his resignation, Mr Gunner praised Ms Fyles as ""Australia's best Health Minister"". ""Tash, Australia's best Health Minister. I don't know what's better – seeing how much fun she has on the floor of parliament, or seeing how much the other side hates it,"" he said. Part of Labor's left faction, Ms Fyles was viewed alongside Ms Manison, of the right faction, to be the frontrunners for the job. Ms Fyles represents the electorate of Nightcliff in Darwin's northern suburbs, which is considered the safest Labor seat in the territory, with a large margin of 26.7 per cent. Since the election of Mr Gunner in 2016, Ms Manison has been the Northern Territory's Deputy Chief Minister, and had been acting in the role following his sudden resignation. During the week she had been described by some as a ""logical"" choice to succeed Mr Gunner. On Wednesday Ms Manison said it would be important for the caucus to select a new chief minister and avoid the protracted voting process, saying ""people want stability"". Ms Manison, who was by Ms Fyles's side at a press conference this morning, praised her selection as leader. ""I want to give my full congratulations to Natasha, and I am just so proud of her today,"" she said. ""I've had the great privilege to serve with her my whole parliamentary career. ""What I can tell you about your new Chief Minister is that you have got somebody who loves this place, who is so committed to the Northern Territory, who is tenacious, hard-working, determined, and she is going to make a huge difference."" Federal Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, who is expected to fly into Darwin this afternoon, congratulated Ms Fyles on her appointment. ""I know Natasha well,"" he said. ""She's been a very good minister and she'll make an outstanding Chief Minister."" Northern Territory Opposition Leader Lia Finnochiaro said she expected Ms Fyles's leadership to be no different to her predecessor. ""I don't think Natasha Fyles knows how to lead a different government, because the reality is, all they've done is shuffle the deckchairs,"" she said. ""It would have been fantastic if the Labor government emerged today with a new leader, a fresh face, a new plan and a fresh start. ""But instead, what we saw is the same old Labor circus with a different Labor clown."" Ms Finocchiaro also said the government's unity was in question, after Ms Fyles did not say if Ms Manison would be her deputy beyond next week's cabinet reshuffle. ""To emerge from a leadership battle without a deputy by your side shows that there is much more infighting to come,"" she said.

10,The diabolically simple question that tripped Morrison,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Today brings the end of Week Five, and confirmation that the Prime Minister has reached the bargaining phase in the crushing 360-degree employee review that this campaign has become. These moments are never easy to witness. Here's how it happened. In the at-risk Victorian Liberal electorate of Chisholm, whither the PM had repaired to fiddle with motherboards at a tech factory and wax lyrical about the Member for Chisholm, Gladys Liu, in front of an underwhelmed-looking cohort of lab-coated employees, the PM assumed the position for his daily press conference. Sky News reporter Andrea Crothers — part of the travelling media pack well accustomed to the PM's fondness for avowing what ""Australians know"" to be true — slipped in a diabolically simple question. ""Prime Minister, isn't part of your problem that you keep telling them what they know, rather than listening?"" Now, asking Scott Morrison a question is easy. Getting an answer is harder. And more often than not, you get the answer to the question the PM would have liked you to ask, rather than the one you actually did. And in this case, he started out by explaining that Australians know him for his strength and decisiveness during the pandemic. A classic interview manoeuvre from the ""What's my weakness? Oh, I guess it's probably that I'm a workaholic"" job interview school. But having started talking, he somehow couldn't stop. ""I know [that] Australians know I can be a bit of a bulldozer when it comes to issues,"" he confided. For a man who loves to be photographed hard-hattedly astride various pieces of heavy machinery, the revelation that to some extent he actually identifies as a vehicle feels… significant. But it didn't stop there, either. ""As we go into this next period on the other side of the pandemic, I know things that are going to have to change with the way I do things,"" Mr Morrison continued. For the entire time he's been in office, Mr Morrison's entire offering has been incumbency. ""I'm the Prime Minister,"" he likes to remind people. As of today, however, he's prepared to be a different kind of guy, if we'll just give him another chance. A clearly thrilled Anthony Albanese, in Cairns, found himself 10 yards out and dead in front of the sticks. Not always, with this player, an absolute guarantee of points, but today he did not miss, booting two in quick succession. ""A bulldozer knocks things over,"" said the Labor leader. ""I'm a builder, that's what I am. If I'm elected prime minister, I will build things in this country. ""This government has been there for almost a decade, this prime minister has four years in office, and what he's saying is, 'If you vote for Scott Morrison, I'll change'. ""That's what he's saying. 'Vote for me and I'll change'. Well, if you want change, change the government."" Late-campaign handbrake turns are extremely tricky to pull off. In 2007, keen to repair the damage from a botched cabinet assassination attempt against John Howard, Howard and his grumpy deputy Peter Costello granted a joint interview to Today Tonight to demonstrate that they had a new and warm relationship. It was fascinatingly awkward, and of course did not work. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. The worst damage to the Prime Minister from today isn't that people now think any worse of him or will forever picture him staring at himself in the mirror of a morning and softly saying ""Brrrooooommmm"". It's that to a messy and disjointed prime ministerial campaign that so far has been about jobs, but also China, but also dentists, but also who's allowed to play in the girls' team, you can now add an exciting new discussion about how the PM is planning to change and why. A shocker. It's why when asking our daily question about who had a Good Day and who had a Bad Day, the answer for Friday, May 13 is — in order – Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison. It's odd to call it an election launch when more than a million people will have already voted and it's less than a week until the big day, but that's exactly what Scott Morrison and the Coalition has in front of it this Sunday. While Labor held their launch in Perth, the Liberals stumped up for Brisbane — not ideal when the city is struggling with heavy downpours and flooding for the umpteenth time this year. Behind in the polls, Morrison's launch will be his last major event to win over undecided voters We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

11,"Scott Morrison makes a late campaign strategy shift, acknowledging he's been a 'bulldozer'",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Liberal Party is so acutely conscious of Scott Morrison's unpopularity that its pitch to voters has been crafted to accommodate it. ""It's not a popularity test,"" Mr Morrison said at the outset of the six-week long election campaign. Early voting centres are open. Here's your personalised pocket guide to the 2022 election. ""You go to the dentist, it doesn't matter if you like him or not. You want to know they're good at their job."" Having your teeth drilled into is a particularly unpleasant experience to compare your leadership to, but it was an effort to suggest skill and hardiness are more important for a Prime Minister than likeability. ""You may not like everything we've done, you may not like me that much, but that's not the point,"" he said at the time. It was an analogy used by colleagues, too, particularly Deputy Prime Minister and Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce, who has returned to the comparison of his colleague to a physically painful procedure several times. Given just a year ago he was calling Mr Morrison a ""hypocrite"" and a ""liar"" in private text messages, one might presume Mr Joyce doesn't much like going to the dentist. But the Prime Minister has changed his tune as he enters the final week of the campaign, trailing in the polls and momentum swinging behind Labor. ""I know (that) Australians know I can be a bit of a bulldozer when it comes to issues,"" he conceded. ""As we go into this next period on the other side of the pandemic, I know things that are going to have to change with the way I do things."" A promise to change, if given the chance, ""because we're moving into a different time, a time of opportunity."" In campaign terms, it is a tectonic shift. With eight days to go until the May 21 poll, the appeal for voters to stick with a known quantity has been re-cast as a vow to transform anew. The Scott Morrison of the last three years will be different to the Scott Morrison in the years ahead, he offers. Labor sees not a dentist, nor a bulldozer, but a leopard that will not be capable of changing its spots. ""If you want change, change the government,"" Anthony Albanese said, pouncing on the Prime Minister's words scarcely an hour after he uttered them. ""Don't look for Scott Morrison to change, because that's not going to happen. Just change the government."" Said with a gusto that has often missing from the Labor leader's stump speeches, Mr Albanese leant into the Prime Minister's words. ""A bulldozer wrecks things, a bulldozer knocks things over. I'm a builder, that's what I am. And if I'm elected Prime Minister, I'll build things in this country."" Labor's campaign headquarters was just as quick to capitalise on the comments on social media. They've both spent their lives in politics but come May 21, one will be prime minister and the other will likely face the end of their political career. A long, six-week campaign was a deliberate choice by the Liberal Party, knowing the maximum amount of time was needed to make the case for a fourth term in office. Throughout, Mr Morrison has carefully calibrated his words, his tone and his focus in an effort to work with, rather than challenge, impressions of his character. To alter the strategy so drastically, and so late, in the campaign suggests a desperation at campaign headquarters. The dial isn't shifting for Scott Morrison. Until now, the election contest has been characterised as between a man that people don't know and a man that people don't like. Now, it is between a man whose election would instantly bring change and a man who is promising to change himself, if just given one more chance.

12,"Despite Albanese's campaign hiccups, the election appears his to lose",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Liberals have used John Howard extensively during this campaign. These days, they celebrate their party hero as the great winner. He was, however, the last Liberal prime minister to take his party into the wilderness. There are comparisons and contrasts between 2007 and 2022. In each election the Coalition government was ""old"" — in 2007 it was seeking a fifth term; now it's asking for a fourth. People were ""over"" Howard, as they're ""over"" Scott Morrison. But the feeling against Howard was that he'd had his time — it's visceral against Morrison. Kevin Rudd was a fresh face, plugged into the rising issue of the times, climate change. Anthony Albanese often projects more as old Labor than future Labor. Oh, and interest rates went up by 25 basis points during each campaign — to 6.75 per cent (an 11 year high) in 2007 and to 0.35 per cent in 2022 (still at rock bottom). Despite Albanese's campaign hiccups, at the end of this penultimate week, based on the objective evidence, the election appears his to lose. The Australian newspaper's YouGov poll, which surveyed almost 19,000 people across all lower house seats between April 14 and May 7, had Labor on track to majority government. Albanese looked more relaxed than Morrison, more confident — no doubt due to every public and internal poll conducted in recent weeks — and, most importantly, scored more policy wins. This is not predictive — it's a snapshot. Both sides know the final campaign days provide risks and opportunities. A sizeable number of voters have yet to firm up their decisions. In particular, how will soft Liberal voters who are put off by Morrison break? Between those who opt to swallow hard and stick with the government and those who can't stomach the PM any longer? But to state the obvious, Morrison has a short time in which to try reduce a big margin. Last minute scare campaigns can play effectively; unexpected developments can change the dynamics. But that's only if enough voters in the right seats retain an open mind. The Liberals have left their launch, to be held in Brisbane on Sunday, until the last moment. New policy will be announced. Morrison needs to garner some momentum from it for the home run. Next week will see the release of important economic data, on unemployment and wages. The government will be hoping the unemployment figure, most recently 4 per cent, will have a three in front of it. That would be good news for the Coalition's economic pitch. The wages number could play to Labor. Wages growth was 2.3 per cent in the year to December. Any increase on that for the year to March would be expected to be small. The Reserve Bank has forecast wage growth of 2.7 per cent in the year to June, indicating it doesn't anticipate much in March. Albanese's decision yesterday to put a figure on where he'd like to see wages rise lit a fire under a debate which to date has consisted largely of empathetic generalities. If next week's figure is modest, Labor will be able to use it to highlight its case that many people are going backwards in real terms, given the 5.1 per cent inflation rate. One skill in politics is to be able to turn a negative into a neutral, or a positive, and Albanese did this in the argument over wages and inflation this week. He initially slipped up, when he embraced the desirability of the minimum hourly wage being increased by 5.1 per cent, to match inflation. The reasons he should not have been so precise have been well canvassed. But when subsequently he translated such a rise into ""two coffees a day"", the proposition would look to many voters more than reasonable (regardless of some counter economic arguments). Morrison jumped on Albanese's wages position as evidence the Opposition Leader did not understand economic matters, with the derogatory put down that ""Anthony Albanese is a loose unit on the economy."" But that meant the Prime Minister was advocating a real wage cut for the lowest paid workers. The Albanese-as-risk claim is about the best attack line the government has got, but when the debate is about wages, the government is fighting on Labor's preferred turf. If Albanese's campaign has had mistakes and glitches, Morrison's is undermined by the very obvious fact he's leading a divided party. Hardly any Liberals would have heard of Katherine Deves before she shot to prominence as Morrison's captain's pick for Warringah. Now her views on transgender issues, which the PM thinks will work for him among some ethnic voters, are causing the Liberals serious internal and external angst. In a video, former prime minister Tony Abbott, who lost Warringah to independent Zali Steggall in 2019, has urged reluctant Liberal members in the seat to get behind Deves. ""The more I see of Katherine Deves the more impressed I am with her courage, with her common sense, with her decency and with quite frankly her capacity to win this seat back for the Liberal Party,"" Abbott said. The death of shame allows politicians to play both sides of a street, as we're increasingly seeing in the matter of Katherine Deves. Voters disgruntled with Abbott's high profile campaign against marriage equality was a factor in his defeat in 2019. His words about Deves suggest he remains tone deaf to the views of many in the party and the public within his old seat. While Abbott lavishes praise on Deves, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, fighting for his political life against a teal candidate in Kooyong, was again distancing himself from Morrison's defence of her. ""I myself have been very clear in rejecting what Katherine Deves has been saying. Her comments have been insensitive, they've been inappropriate,"" he reiterated on the ABC. Morrison has said that in his ""captain's pick"" candidates for various NSW seats he was anxious to run women. A study by the Australian National University's Global Institute for Women's Leadership, released Thursday, of candidates from the major parties found only about 20 per cent of female Coalition candidates are running in safe seats. This compares with 46 per cent of male candidates. More than half (51 per cent) of Coalition women candidates are running in marginal seats — under 6 per cent — compared with 25 per cent of male candidates. Some ""80 per cent of female candidates in the Coalition are [...] running in seats they are unlikely to win, or that are precarious to hold. The equivalent proportion of men running in these seats is 54 per cent,"" the study says. If the Liberals lose this election, addressing the women problem will be among many issues confronting a shattered party. Meanwhile women present a major obstacle in Morrison's attempt to pull this election out of the fire. The female teal candidates will be attractive to women voters in those seats. More generally, Morrison is significantly more unpopular with women than with men. Women voters could be in the vanguard if May 21 delivers him a mortal blow.

13,This simple act of political skulduggery has been refined into an art form. So why is no one calling it out?,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency In the trade, they're known as ""drops"". These are strategically timed releases of information given to selected journalists by politicians or their proxies from all jurisdictions, which are designed to generate advantageous coverage. Unlike leaks and acts of whistleblowing, which are often motivated by a loftier moral purpose, drops are mainly about political point-scoring. Inside the Canberra bubble, it's a well-known media management tactic used by parties — more so by the government of the day and especially in the run-up to an election. Among members of the political media corps, this practice is mostly tolerated and, in some cases, even embraced. And that's despite coming with conditions attached and hidden agendas. ANALYSIS: Catch-up on the latest from the campaign trail on Friday with Annabel Crabb All this makes for a secretive and highly transactional relationship, one that Denis Muller from the Centre for Advancing Journalism at the University of Melbourne describes as an exercise in ""mutual back-scratching"". ""The public is being duped by this stuff,"" Dr Muller said. ""It's basically journalism turned into propaganda."" And former Sydney Morning Herald chief political correspondent and press gallery stalwart Mark Kenny concurred. His characterisation, however, is even more acerbic: a ""symbiotic relationship … between host and parasite"". ""Governments use information, and I say this for both sides, in a way that I think is corrupt,"" said Professor Kenny, now at the Australian National University's Australian Studies Institute. ""The public has a right to know and yet the right to know has been corrupted by the way they've managed to spin [the information] out into the public realm."" Sunday is usually a slow news day. It's a challenge for news gatherers to find newsworthy material to fill Monday morning's content black hole. So it's a perfect time for politicians to pitch stories and organise appearances for the start of the working week. On the afternoon of Sunday, February 13 this year, an email was sent from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's office to several media outlets. ""Note, this has gone far and wide,"" the email advised, meaning the drop being pitched was not exclusive. Citing ""unpublished ATO [Australian Tax Office] data"" and ""unpublished Treasury analysis"", the drop was titled ""Tax cuts and young Australian women driving the economic recovery"" and it came with a publication embargo of 10:30pm that night. You can read the Treasurer's drop here. Not for the first time, the hook of ""previously unpublished"" government data and analysis was being used both as bait to sell a drop and to burnish the validity of the claims being made. This drop, by the way, is nowhere to be found in the official media release archive of the Treasurer's ministerial website. Nor is there any public record of the previously unpublished data or analysis cited by Mr Frydenberg's office. The Australian Financial Review (AFR), The Australian and the Canberra Times were among several news outlets to pick this up. And the story was also syndicated to mastheads in the Australian Community Newspaper network and by News Corp's in-house news wire. Although all qualified their headlines, like the AFR's story below, the reporting remained largely in lock-step with the messaging contained in the drop: that, thanks to the Coalition, younger women were better off. Better off than whom? Well presumably not men, because almost all the summarised data and analysis presented to make the point compared younger women against ""every other cohort"", meaning women in other age groups. The stories did not include comments from the opposition and no opinion was cited from a subject matter expert, like an independent economist. The statistical evidence – the ATO data and Treasury analysis – was not able to be independently sense-checked or critiqued. Had anyone picked up the phone and called someone like Matt Grudnoff, a senior economist at the Australia Institute, a progressive think tank, they might have come away with a different take. ""They were better off than if they hadn't had the tax cut, but younger women wouldn't have been a stand-out beneficiary,"" Mr Grudnoff told the ABC. ""There would have been other groups that benefited more, including men."" And the drop travelled well beyond print. The Treasurer was also able to slip his talking points, uncontested, into eight TV and radio interviews on the Monday, including two ABC programs. At least some of the reporters who picked up the story alluded to the timing of the drop, but no-one treated it for what it really was: an attempt to change the narrative around perceptions about the Coalition a week after Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins were in the headlines. ""It is very difficult, if we're honest, to write completely objectively and to be critical of information that has been given to you,"" Professor Kenny said. ""And there's an unspoken agreement, that you will give prominent and favourable coverage to the depiction of that story."" Mr Frydenberg's office, the Australian Financial Review and The Australian were offered the right of reply but did not respond. The data and analysis used to corroborate the drop is still not publicly available. Despite the waning presence of the print medium over the past few decades, many politicians still hanker to see their drops splashed over the front pages of the nation's newspapers. The cachet of print remains a drawcard. ""They get the biggest bang for their buck by having it in print,"" Dr Muller said. ""There is more, shall we say, aesthetic authority in something printed. But the other thing is, it's not ephemeral in the way that the broadcast news is."" That's why drops often come with embargoes for 10pm, 10:30pm and sometimes even midnight or 5am. This is mainly designed to keep the story ""fresh"" for morning newspapers. This also acts to restrain a reporter's ability to talk too widely to other parties about the story before the publication embargo. And sometimes, just to ensure there's no chance of an opponent or critic hijacking the narrative before publication, some drops also come with a ""no third-party contact"" clause. Away from the cameras, candidates are fighting for your vote: in your social media feed, on your phone and in your letterbox. Help us uncover these hidden tactics. This is effectively a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and journalists must agree not to seek comment from anyone else about the information provided prior to publication or broadcast. The publication embargoes and the NDAs are also control mechanisms. They are intended to limit opportunities to introduce balance, perspective or alternative opinions into the story that would challenge or dilute the messaging contained in the drop. It's no secret inside the bubble; it's been going on for years. Labor did the same thing when it was last in power. ""[The journalists] get the story in return for just presenting the point of view of the person providing the information, and nobody else,"" Melbourne University's Dr Muller said. ""And that's clearly a betrayal of public trust, because it's a failure of impartiality."" Break the embargo, bury it, spin the story in a different direction or allow contrarian voices to dilute the original message and you risk being banished to press gallery purgatory in what could be a professional death wish. In the vernacular of Parliament House, the tap will be turned off. ""And I speak with experience as someone who has been on the wrong end of being cut off from government drops, for giving … what they regard as hostile coverage. And it can be career-ending, it can be very damaging,"" Professor Kenny said. While most news outlets are offered drops, Dr Muller says it's clear the government has its favourites. ""Governments of every persuasion have used the drop and have tended to give it to favoured outlets. But this present government has brought it to an art form,"" he said. ""In fact, it's got to the point where News Corp is basically a propaganda arm of the government."" This drop, for instance, was published on The Australian's front page on April 5. It reported that the government would announce a plan later that day to spend $3.5 billion to fast-track the purchase of new missiles and strike a partnership with two weapon makers to develop local manufacturing capability. This is an example of a type of drop where announcements or speech extracts are fed to selected news outlets a day in advance of their planned delivery. This happens on an industrial scale in the lead-up to a budget. And in the day or days preceding the formal launch of a party's election platform. In this story, dropped just before the election was called, Defence Minister Peter Dutton is the only person quoted or cited. There's also no opposition voice and no evidence of any input from experts. And all the direct quotes in the story can be found in two press releases (here and here) published by Mr Dutton's office after the article was published. What has happened here is that The Australian was given an advance copy of Mr Dutton's press releases with a midnight embargo. And that was then recombined into an ""exclusive"" page one splash. This, says ANU's Professor Kenny, is a canonical example of how a ministerial press release is laundered through the lens of a compliant newspaper to give it an ""extra sheen of authority and objectivity"". And there's more. The story about the drop will sometimes be recycled as a prop and used to reach out to an entirely different audience on social media. Here's what appeared on the Liberal Party's Facebook page after The Australian's ""exclusive"" report about the missiles. The post has since garnered more than 900 likes, 200 comments and 50 shares. That's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of Facebook performance, but it shows that the story is reaching a broader audience beyond the newspaper's narrow subscriber base. ""It's a way of, in a sense, amplifying the duplicity that's involved in all of this,"" Dr Muller said. And this is by no means a one-off. The Liberal Party's Facebook has many more examples of drops that became stories before being recycled as Facebook posts. Mr Dutton's office and The Australian were offered the right of reply but did not respond. Another advantage of the drop is its first-strike impact. ""That critical first [paragraph] and headline, the placement of that story, changes that story's introduction into the public mind from then on,"" Professor Kenny said. On day one, the story makes big headlines and worms its way into the national conversation, even if the substance of the story is contested. Here's a recent example from the office of Energy and Emission Reduction Minister Angus Taylor. It was carried on the front pages of News Corp stablemates the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph and Adelaide's The Advertiser newspapers on April 19. Citing ""government modelling estimates"", the story said under Labor's energy policy, household electricity users would be ""worse off"" by an average of $560 a year. It included some strident debunking of the claims from Shadow Minister for Climate and Energy Chris Bowen, and there were quotes from two third-party experts. The news report also cited ""government modelling"", but that too was unseen by anyone else except the reporter and has not been made publicly available. You can read the minister's drop here. The drop was later sent to other publications after the News Corp papers were published, but that too did not provide the modelling, nor was it even mentioned. But by that time, the horse had bolted. And subsequent follow-ups by the ABC and the Guardian among others, which were less credulous of the claims, were not as prominently displayed or as widely discussed. ""And so, the first voice becomes by far the loudest voice, because follow-up stories never get the same degree of attention as the originating story,"" Dr Muller said. Mr Taylor's office, the Herald Sun and The Daily Telegraph were offered the right of reply but did not respond. The modelling used to corroborate the drop is still not publicly available. The example of the drops from the offices of Josh Frydenberg and Peter Dutton are but two of many drops that we have observed and logged in a spreadsheet we have been collating going back to September 2021. While it is difficult to prove conclusively that all those logged stories originated as drops, some are more clear-cut than others. (""Dirt-file"" drops are notoriously difficult to trace because the giver of the information doesn't want their fingerprints on the evidence in case it exposes the veneer of objectivity.) Challenges in monitoring radio and TV means that only drops to newspapers and news websites have been collected. And while newspapers are the primary beneficiaries of this arrangement, drops are also given to broadcast journalists, including the ABC. An ABC spokesperson acknowledged that ABC journalists also received ""tip-offs, information and announcements"" not just from the government, but ""from all sides of politics"". ""But it is incumbent on ABC journalists to maintain the independence and integrity of the ABC, which means exercising editorial control over stories and ensuring decisions are not improperly influenced by political, sectional, commercial or personal interests,"" he said. ""In other words, any information an ABC journalist receives must be duly evaluated and fact-checked before it becomes part of a report."" As ANU's Mark Kenny points out, the competition for scoops makes it almost impossible to bite the hand that is feeding you. ""But what I would say … about elections, on top of my point about them being choreographed and everything else, is that skulduggery is everywhere,"" he said. ""And the journalists' job is not to be influenced by it and to remember the readers, remember the viewers, your audience. Do the job. Stick to the facts. That's what I'd say.""

They plan to get there by investing more than $20 billion in ""low emissions technologies"" in the next decade. Labor has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, along with a 2030 target of a 43 per cent cut in emissions. The party plans to upgrade the electricity grid, make electric vehicles cheaper, install community batteries and modernise steel and aluminium productions. The Greens want a 75 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 and want to hit net zero by 2035. The Greens want to phase out coal and gas completely and switch to 100 per cent renewable energy usage as soon as possible. The Coalition plans to work with the private sector to increase the uptake of EVs, hybrids and hydrogen powered vehicles, and will fund 50,000 new EV chargers. Labor wants to upgrade the electricity grid and introduce an electric car discount. The Greens are pushing for an ""electric vehicle revolution"" and plan for all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. The Reserve Bank of Australia sets interest rates. The government generally does not set, or put a cap on, interest rates. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has advocated for the minimum wage to be lifted 5.1 per cent in line with inflation, but has stopped short of saying he would formally submit that figure to the independent wage umpire. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says a 5 per cent increase could take a real toll on small businesses. The Coalition halved the fuel excise in the federal budget ahead of the election in late March. But it's only temporary with the cut due to expire at 11:59pm on September 28, 2022. Labor has not offered to extend the fuel excise cut past September. The Coalition has announced plans to expand its first home buyers and its Family Home Guarantee schemes. Labor is offering to help 10,000 households a year into home ownership as part of a ""shared-equity"" scheme and will also expand the first home buyers scheme. In shared equity schemes, the government covers part of the cost of a property, that can then be bought by the home owner over time. These types of schemes are already run in Victoria and Western Australia. The National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) makes rent more affordable for 22,000 properties nationwide.

The Coalition government has not publicly backed a case in the Fair Work Commission to raise aged care workers' wages. Labor is promising to have a registered nurse on site at all times of the day. It would require staff to spend at least three hours and 35 minutes with each resident — in line with the aged care royal commission's recommendation. Labor also supports the push for an increase to workers' wages and will fully fund any increase. Party leader Anthony Albanese has admitted the party will need to recruit overseas health workers as a ""stopgap"" measure.

16,It's a key promise to limit enormous emissions from fracking. But a government email has fuelled concerns it might not happen,politics,"  NT government bureaucrat warns fully implementing fracking recommendation 9.8 could scare off gas industry in confidential email For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A senior Northern Territory environmental bureaucrat warned that fully implementing a key commitment to limit fracking emissions could scare off the gas industry, confidential government correspondence reveals. The document, obtained by the ABC under Freedom of Information, also warns there might not be enough carbon credits in Australia to offset all emissions from fracking in the Beetaloo Basin. The basin, about 500 kilometres south-east of Darwin, is a large shale gas field that has formed a critical part of the federal government's post-COVID ""gas-led recovery"". When the NT government lifted a ban on fracking in 2018, it agreed to ""seek to ensure"" there would be no net increase in Australia's life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from producing gas, a recommendation known as ""9.8"" in a landmark fracking inquiry. However, in an email from within the NT Department of Environment from March last year to Chief Executive Joanne Townsend, public servant Paul Purdon asks ""how ambitious"" the government wants to be, saying the ""preferred approach"" was to focus on emissions within the NT's control, as well as the net-zero by 2050 target. ""Full implementation of recommendation 9.8 would place the NT at a competitive disadvantage in attracting gas production and related downstream development,"" Mr Purdon writes. In response to questions about the email, an NT government spokeswoman said all public policy advice ""should include analysis of how it applies, intersects or conflicts with other policies and policy commitments"". Environmentalists claim the correspondence raises serious questions. ""It's not appropriate for the environmental regulator to be factoring in questions of whether or not the gas industry is going to appreciate having to offset their emissions,"" Hannah Ekin from the Arid Lands Environment Centre said. ""We see this again and again — [the government] are bending over backwards to facilitate this gas industry, regardless of what the impacts are on our community. The correspondence has escalated long-standing concerns that Recommendation 9.8 to offset emissions could be weakened. The fracking inquiry's recommendation specifically related to limiting life cycle greenhouse gas emissions – that is, all emissions created from the production of gas in the NT as well as its transportation and consumption elsewhere. Politicians, environmentalists, traditional owners and gas company representatives have arrived in Darwin for a public hearing into the Beetaloo Basin. Many of those emissions will occur outside of the Northern Territory, so the inquiry made the Recommendation a responsibility for the Commonwealth government too. The NT government has previously said gas companies will play a significant role too, and it has recently progressed policies that would require companies to use mechanisms like carbon credits to offset their emissions. However, in the email, Mr Purdon wrote that a key question for the government was ""how ambitious [it] wants to be in implementing recommendation 9.8 in the NT itself"". He wrote that one option would be ""to require the offsetting of all production emissions (petroleum companies only)"" and another would be to ""require the offsetting of all production, transportation and consumption emissions in the NT"". He also wrote that it was ""questionable"" whether the national supply of recognised carbon credits would be enough to offset life cycle emissions from NT gas. Mark Ogge, a climate and energy advisor with the Australia Institute and observer in this space, said it was ""absolutely damning that there's not enough offsets in all of Australia to offset the potential emissions from fracking in the Northern Territory."" ""If that's the case and there's not enough offsets, it simply means — if the emissions can't be offset — then fracking shouldn't be able to go ahead,"" he said. Other challenges Mr Purdon listed in the email include: ""The preferred approach to delivering recommendation 9.8 is to focus on the emissions that are in the Territory's control, in the context of the net zero by 2050 target and the pathway required to achieve the target,"" the email said. There is also confusion over the extent of the Morrison government's support for the recommendation. The federal government holds that the fracking inquiry's report was not a report for the Commonwealth, but said it would work with the NT government to honour its commitment. NT Renewables and Energy Minister Eva Lawler has denied the federal government has distanced itself, pointing to a bilateral energy and emissions deal signed last month. ""Recommendation 9.8 means that we all have to work together to achieve that recommendation,"" she said. She said her government had taken many steps to achieve the recommendation, including progressing emissions offsets policies which require companies to address climate change. Ms Ekin from the Arid Lands Environment Centre said she was concerned the government's focus was shifting to its broader target of net zero emissions by 2050. But she said failing to honour the commitment before production begins could call ""into question the viability of living in the Top End of Australia into the future"". ""We think everything needs to be done to prevent out-of-control climate change — the stakes are that high,"" she said.

17,"ASX defies Wall Street downer, as crypto struggles and $A falls",politics,"  ASX defies Wall Street downer, as crypto struggles and $A falls For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The Australian share market is ending the week on a high despite global markets still struggling with looming rate hikes, war and inflation. The ASX 200 opened higher and, by 11am AEST, it was up 1.4 per cent, to 7,039. And the All Ords was up a similar amount. That positive mood continued, with the ASX 200 eventually finished up 1.9per cent, at 7,075. The All Ords was up even more, at 2 per cent, helping it regain the heavy losses it had during the week. All the major sectors were in the green. The top-performing stocks were Life360 (+13.4 per cent) and Polynovo (+12.7 per cent). However, over the past five days, the benchmark has still lost 1.81 per cent. The Dow Jones closed 0.3 per cent down, while the S&P 500 was 0.1 per cent lower. However, the Dow Jones had recovered some losses during late trade. The Nasdaq was marginally up, by 0.1 per cent. That's after the tech sector has suffered heavy losses off the back of higher-than-expected inflation data out of the US. Crypto is still struggling, but Bitcoin has recovered a slice of what it lost yesterday. By 4:30pm, it was back above the benchmark $US30,000. The devastating effects of the crash of crypto ""stablecoins"" Terra and Luna are being felt by many but their crash may have been orchestrated in one massive piece of ethically questionable trading. This is as investors say that people are putting their cash back into the safe haven of the American currency. The Australian currency was also down. As the ANZ noted this morning: ""The AUD is firmly below 69 US cents as global equities resumed their decline overnight. Pressure remains to the downside for the AUD."" Meanwhile, there's speculation that Europe will soon increase rates. Inflation is also a problem in countries there, with the shortage of gas especially putting pressure on economies. ""In Europe, we have recently revised up our inflation forecasts and anticipate the [European Central Bank] will hike rates in July,"" ANZ noted.

18,"Penny Wong, Marise Payne clash over relationship with Solomon Islands, China — as it happened",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Labor's Foreign Affairs Shadow Minister Penny Wong clash in a debate at the National Press Club. Look back on all of Friday's updates as they happened in our blog. By Jessica Riga Thank you for your company today. We'll be back on Sunday to live blog the Liberal Party campaign launch. And then after that ... we're into the final week of the election campaign! Can you believe it? You can continue to stay up to date here on our Australia Votes website. Until next time, stay well! And if you're in Queensland, I hope you're able to stay safe during this severe weather. By Jessica Riga Mark your calendars. We'll be live blogging the whole thing right here on the ABC News website. By Jessica Riga By Jessica Riga A Nationals' robocall attacking an independent challenger is being investigated by authorities, over a lengthy silence inserted between the ad and its authorisation. The improperly authorised message, targeted at voters in the Victorian seat of Nicholls, attacks independent candidate Rob Priestly. ""You've heard a lot about Rob Priestly, but have you heard where he stands on really important issues,"" the advertisement begins. ""Issues like the defence of our nation, like our relationship with China and issues like border protection and whether he supports higher taxes?"" ""And why won't Rob Priestly say who he will support in the event of a hung parliament? What's he got to hide?"" After the voice message concludes, the call contains 10 seconds of ""dead air"", before finally running the authorisation message which reveals the advertisement is from the National Party. By Jessica Riga Conservative lobby group Advance Australia has independent ACT Senate candidate David Pocock in its sights, with Facebook advertising data revealing that the group's offensive against the former rugby star is disproportionate to its campaigning against any other candidate. By Jessica Riga A high-tech Chinese surveillance ship has been tracked off the Western Australian coast, close to a secretive naval facility that supports American and other allied submarines. Defence Minister Peter Dutton has revealed the auxiliary general intelligence (AGI) vessel was closely monitored by the ADF over the past week as it sailed south past the Harold E Holt Naval Communication Station at Exmouth. “It’s come into the Australian exclusive economic zone, its intention its to collect intelligence,” Mr Dutton said. Reporting by defence correspondent Andrew Greene By Jessica Riga Described as ""glass cliff candidates"", women standing for both major parties still face a greater battle to get into parliament, with new analysis showing they are more likely to be running in a marginal or unwinnable seat than male counterparts. The report by the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at the Australian National University (ANU) showed while the number of women in parliament has grown, female candidates continue to be under-represented in safe, winnable, seats. It describes ""glass cliff candidates"" as women who are given opportunities at leadership and politics in times of crisis or when things are risky. ""That is, women are allowed to step in when men aren't interested,"" the report said. The analysis looked at how many female candidates were standing for either the Coalition or Labor in the election in safe seats and compared it to the number standing in marginal seats or those considered unwinnable in the House of Representatives. The researchers focused on the 137 seats where the main competition is between Labor and a Coalition — Liberal or National — candidate, and used the Australian Electoral Commission's definition of marginal and safe seat. By Jessica Riga Scott Morrison turns 54 today. By Jessica Riga The Prime Minister’s appeal for voters to stick with a known quantity has been re-cast as a vow to transform anew. Scott Morrison is promising the last three years will be different to the Scott Morrison in the years ahead. In campaign terms, it is a tectonic shift, writes political reporter Melissa Clarke. By Jessica Riga Here's the latest from political reporter Matthew Doran, who is on the campaign trail with Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese. Picture this. You're on a tropical island in the heart of the Great Barrier Reef. Beginner scuba divers are bobbing around in the clear blue waters, as a pair of paddle boarders float by slowly. ""I'm having the time of my life,"" one proclaimed. All you can hear is the lapping of waves on the shell covered beach, and the chatter of people lounging in the Autumnal sun. Then, boom. The serenity is pierced by a politician, their posse and pack of about two dozen media. Welcome to paradise, in a marginal seat. Labor leader Anthony Albanese made the trip to Fitzroy Island to spruik his green policies and, particularly, extra funding for the Great Barrier Reef. Cash on the table to protect one of the nation's treasures is unlikely to ever be shunned, even if there's always a degree or two of scepticism about whether the money for the Reef ever actually achieves its ambitions. But, it's another situation where Labor has to face questions about its own climate credentials, as it takes a whack at the Coalition's record. One of the most difficult issues for Labor at the 2019 poll was the criticism it was trying to sell two messages on climate change: one in metro areas, and the other in regional parts of the country. The message for city dwellers was that Labor would cut emissions faster than the Coalition. But that didn't tally with the concerns of regional Australians, many working in blue collar industries, about their futures. Where would they work, if the mines and factories were transitioning? To them, 'transition' became a synonym for 'close'. Today. I asked the man who wants to be prime minister how he can claim he'd better protect the Reef when he also still supports the coal and gas industry in Queensland. Was the announcement of extra funding for the Reef a treatment of the symptoms, rather than the cause of the Reef's demise? His answer was that both can be supported at the same time — showing how it's a political tightrope still being walked in 2022. After meeting one of the island's residents, Tommy the Turtle, the Albanese Bus — actually a boat, an opportunity for #Alboat to take off — pulled away from the wharf. Staff of the resort on Fitzroy Island were smiling and waving to those on board. As happy to see a commitment to protect their jobs in an industry tied to the fate of the Reef, as they were to see the serenity return. By Jessica Riga What were your thoughts on the foreign affairs debate between between Marise Payne and Penny Wong? By Jessica Riga Our nation has not known such a vexing set of circumstances since the end of World War II. But I say to you this: The risks we face will simply be compounded by three more years of Mr Morrison. More of the same excuses, the same political games over national interest, the same buck-passing, whilst our problems only get bigger. Anthony Albanese and Labor have a plan, a responsible plan for a better future. A Pacific policy to ensure we secure our region. Stepping up in South-East Asia to rebuild trust and meet challenges together, shared challenges together, including additional ODA and a special envoy for the region. And shaping the world for the better by taking action on climate, at home and abroad, and modern slavery. What Iwould say to Australians is this: this will be a very loud, possibly quite angry last week of the election campaign. But when it comes to foreign policy, this is our commitment. If you elect Labor on 21 May, you will have a leader in Anthony Albanese who will always put Australia's national interests first. You will have a foreign minister with clout. You will have a cabinet that works together to maximise Australia's influence in the world and to secure our region. You will see more leadership, more energy, and more resources. We will take responsibility and we will act. We won't pass the buck. Thank you for your time today. By Jessica Riga That was the last question of the debate, so it's now time for closing statements. Each speaker gets two minutes for their final pitch. Here's Marise Payne: I think we have agreed today that we are living in a time of great change and uncertainty. And having served this country as both Defence Minister and Foreign Minister, I've had the privilege of seeing firsthand that Australia is deeply respected and that our voice matters. There will be many tough foreign policy decisions ahead. The Morrison Government has shown that we can make those tough decisions and keep Australians safe. Whether it is on AUKUS or resisting economic coercion, or providing the significant support that was necessary for our region to recover together from the COVID pandemic, we have a clear plan focused on promoting the security and the prosperity of the Australian people. We approach this era of strategic competition with confidence in our plan, confidence in our record on foreign policy, and confidence in Australia. It is not easy and it won't be easy, but we can thrive in this era. Our strong economy, our record in managing the pandemic, mean we are well-positioned. There are challenges but also opportunities for Australia, for our manufacturers, for our exporters, for our innovators, for our students, globally and in our region. Under a re-elected Morrison Government, Australia will continue to lead, to speak out, and to be bold in our purpose. We'll be there with other freedom-loving nations when it comes to supporting countries like Ukraine, as they defend their freedom, their democracy and sovereignty. We are always mindful that foreign policy is not detached from the lives of Australians. It is there to further the interests of our nation and improve the wellbeing, the livelihoods, the security, the prosperity of each and every person in this country. By Jessica Riga The responses to that last question went so overtime that Laura Tingle has decided the replies should stick to one minute from here on. Here's a question from Nic Stuart: 30 years ago, you were a young radical, you weren't part of the right-wing dominance of the Liberal Party. You've fought your way through, you've actually become a senator, one of the long-serving ministers. You're also Minister for Women. Why are women now deserting the Liberal Party? What can the Liberal Party do to win them back? Marise Payne disagrees she was a radical. ""I may have been a progressive, but I'll not necessarily claim ""radical"". And, Nic, I have been very strongly committed to ensuring that we have been able to deliver our two last Women's Budget Statements, which together on women's leadership, women's economic security, women's safety, deliver over $5 billion of support. And it is not just about that. It's overwhelmingly about the practical application of those, working with the states and territories on the next National Plan, ensuring that we're addressing economic security through our changes to child care in 2018 and again this year, our work on paid parental leave, and importantly on leadership and particularly participation. Penny Wong gets some laughter when she says ""well, it's a good thing that Marise is Minister for Women, because I can remember when Tony Abbott was, under the Coalition."" ""So, that's an advance! I just want to make this point: I have, including when I was much younger - thank you for reminding us both of that - advocated very strongly inside my party for affirmative action targets. And I didn't just do that, we didn't just do that - the women with whom I worked - because we wanted to get more women into Parliament for its own sake. We wanted to do it because we wanted to change the focus of political parties. I can tell you, having been part of a government and now part of a shadow cabinet, it does matter, having women in the room. It matters in terms of the sorts of policies you announce, the most obvious example, but not the only one is the fact that our very first Budget Reply, Anthony Albanese, in his very first Budget Reply, Anthony Albanese announced our childcare policy."" Marise Payne gets one more comment in. ""I'm very proud to be part of a Cabinet that has more women than any other Australian Cabinet, with eight sitting around the table,"" she says. By Emily Sakzewski  The questioner has asked how we fix this relationship, how the pact was able to happen, what the parties will do given Australia's aid commitments ""can't seem to match China's"", and how Australia would call out corruption if it was to be discovered in Solomon Islands? Penny Wong answers first. She says Labor has put out a detailed policy on the Pacific, with some highlights: ""One is doubling the Pacific Maritime Air Surveillance Program... This is about illegal fishing, it is about protecting their fisheries, which is a source of resources as well as a source of protein. ""We want to deliver an Indo-Pacific broadcasting strategy because I think you need voices in the region. And I think it was short-sighted for the Government's cuts to the ABC, which had the effect of ending a whole range of services into the Pacific. ""And then, of course, the labour scheme, so improving the labour mobility schemes, enabling people for the longer-term scheme to bring their families."" Marise Payne takes her turn to answer and she doesn't agree with the premise of the question, saying it's an oversimplification of a ""very complex set of circumstances"". ""But we must continue to make the contribution that we do to the security and the stability of our region, that maintains the resilience of economies. ""That is why we are making a contribution of over $20 million in terms of budget support to the Solomon Islands. ""It's why we've delivered over 500,000 vaccines to the Solomon Islands, of 1 million, and we'll continue to do so. ""But countries ultimately - and it would be very disturbing if we were not prepared to acknowledge this in Australia - countries will ultimately make sovereign decisions for their own reasons that, occasionally, we don't and can't change, and can't influence."" By Jessica Riga This is the full question asked by Melissa Coade from The Mandarin:  We've had some discord about the Pacific family and climate change. Marise Payne mentioned the three Rs - resilience, relationship, rules. To that end, my question to both of you is - if you will win government after the election, will you in partnership with the Pacific, host a UN climate meeting? Or create a new ambassador for climate? Penny Wong said ""We've already said that we would reinstate the ambassador for climate change. ""And I don't necessarily include Marise in this, but some in the party appear to be allergic to the term. So we would reinstate it. And we would bid for a hosting of the conference of the parties within the UNFCC with our Pacific partners and engagement with the Pacific partners and Pacific neighbours on climate matters greatly."" Marise Payne said ""We do have a very effective ambassador for the environment who covers climate change as well in that remit, and has strongly represented Australia - particularly at the last COP in Glasgow and works closely with the Pacific."" ""Was part of the Our Ocean Conference in Palau in April with secretary Kerry and others. And in relation to whether or not we would host a COP - we would speak with our Pacific neighbours. Of course, as to their ambitions and their interests and determine whether it was something that they wished to pursue."" By Emily Sakzewski Specifically, the questioner asks whether the targets both parties are taking to this election are fixed or whether they are open to listening to the calls of Pacific partners to raise our 2030 targets. Penny Wong says Labor's 2030 target is clear in its policy. ""We haven't just plucked the number out of the air, we have actually gone through the different policy measures."" She also says while Pacific neighbours at risk of the effects of climate change want Australia to go further in its commitments, we must respect their experience. ""I'll say this - I don't think our reputation has really ever got over Mr Dutton standing next to Mr Morrison and making a joke about water lapping at your door."" Marise Payne says Australia is ""dealing in outcomes, not ambitions"". I am not suggesting that they don't seek more... But our support is practical and it is helpful."" By Jessica Riga This question is from debate moderator Laura Tingle: Q: If I could just segway, or attempt it between the question and topic of Taiwan back to the US and comments that you made earlier, Senator Wong. I think that you were channelling Madeleine Albright when you described it as the indispensable partner and said that the alliance was absolutely foundational. I'd like to ask you both to comment on whether you think that US approach to Ukraine has given you greater confidence about the way that the US is engaging in the world? Less confidence? Or does it give you a materially different view about the way that the US is pursuing foreign policy? Marise Payne answers first: Let me affirm that what I said in my previous remark about the foundational nature of the alliance, and say how much we will welcome, warmly, the significant appointment of Caroline Kennedy as the next US Ambassador to Australia, and we expect to see her here in the next couple of months. In terms of the approach on Ukraine - we have been working very closely with the United States, with NATO more broadly, with the UK and other partners. But particularly many smaller liberal democracies in the region who see the threat that Russia's illegal, unlawful invasion of Ukraine presented to them. What the US's engage has done, and I think that it is very important, is to bring together a global Coalition of great strength to both support Ukraine and to extract a cost, a price, on Russia, for their actions that includes, in relation to providing military support for Ukraine in relation to a strong sanctions regime in which Australia is an active participant. We have sanctioned over 800 individuals and entities as part of that. It is a real global Coalition, and the US is a key leader. And here is Penny Wong's reply: What I'd say is that the invasion of and the unlawful war being waged against the people of Ukraine by Mr Putin has been horrific. And is. Continues to be. But what it has demonstrated is the capacity of the US and its NATO partners to be able to work together. It has demonstrated the capacity of a great many nations around the world to stand against the aggregation of the UN charter which stands before us. It has changed policy in Germany, in terms of defence budgets and their policy around provision of weapons. And, it has led Finland to say that it wants to join NATO. So there is an interesting demonstration here. One of the arguments that Mr Putin used was the expansion of NATO. Well... Now we see this. And if we think that it is matter for them, but it's a good thing. By Emily Sakzewski  Specifically, the question asks whether Australia needs to change, ""not in its values, but in the way that it cooperates with other nations like Taiwan"". Marise Payne answers first. She says Australia has always been a supporter of Taiwan's participation in areas where statehood is not required. ""We have a strong representative office in Taipei and we will work closely with countries in the Pacific, like Nauru and Tuvalu, who continue to recognise Taiwan, as we do,"" she says. ""I do think that it is important to note that across the Pacific we are the only country in the world which has a diplomatic mission in every country of the Pacific Island Forum."" It's Penny Wong's turn. On Taiwan, she says Labor's position - a long-standing bipartisan position - has been to focus on ensuring ""that there is no unilateral change to the status quo"". ""We can do that by ensuring that we engage with Taiwan [in the way that] we are able, recognising the diplomatic situation. ""We can do that by ensuring we talk with other parties in the region about the risks to the region from any unilateral change to the status quo."" By Jessica Riga Here's Marise Payne's question to Penny Wong. Marise Payne: A couple of days after the election, about three days, the new prime minister, whoever that will be, will need to demonstrate Australia's ongoing commitment in this region. They will be attending the meeting of the Quad and I know that the Coalition has demonstrated our absolute commitment to making the Quad a major peels of our regional cooperation, as it now is. But what would Labor take to that meeting this time to demonstrate it is committed, and that won't abandon the Quad and our partners like it did in 2008? And here's Penny Wong's reply: We've made clear that we are committed to the Quad. I made that clear some years ago publicly, Mr Albanese has made that clear and we've already engaged, as is appropriate, in the lead-up to an election, about logistics and arrangements to ensure if elected, we would be in place in Tokyo for the commencement of the Quad. I think that one of the things that we should no doubt be speaking about is the developments that we've just been discussing, which is what is occurring in the Pacific. The fact that Solomon Islands is looking beyond Australia for security arrangements, and that is of relevance to the nations of the Quad and the countries of the Indo-Pacific. Marise Payne has a rebuttal: I would say that, of course, Solomon Islands in November of last year looked to Australia for security response, and Australia, with New Zealand, with Fiji, with Papua New Guinea, with therefore the Pacific family, made that response in a matter of hours and provided that support on the ground in the Solomon Islands. And I'd also reinforce that Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has indicated that that is, his view, that Australia is the first security partner of the Solomon Islands. And I've reiterated that with the Foreign Minister from the Solomon Islands myself. Penny Wong: This is inconsistency again. You're saying essentially, if I may - this isn't that big a deal. Barnaby Joyce is saying that it is like Cuba. So I'm just working out which is the position? Marise Payne: I've never said it's not a big deal. And that is a misrepresentation of my position.

19,"Cost blowouts across WA as rising prices, labour shortages impact the budget's bottom line",politics,"  Billion-dollar infrastructure budget blowout highlights impact of labour, supplies shortages For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The WA Government will spend almost $1 billion, and possibly more, to deal with cost blowouts and delays on its infrastructure projects over the next few years. While there has been plenty of attention on the rapidly rising costs and shortages of labour and supplies to build new homes in Perth, the WA budget handed down on Thursday laid bare how badly these problems in the construction market are hurting the state's own projects. For example, the WA Government will inject almost $380 million over the next three years to deal with cost escalations and supply chain problems in its signature rail infrastructure program Metronet. Experts say building grants have had 'unintended consequences' for those trying to navigate Perth's overheated construction market. This money will go towards the new Thornlie-Cockburn rail line and the extension of the Joondalup line to Yanchep. The budget papers also stated the rail line to Perth Airport, slated to be finished by the end of 2020, would now open sometime this year. Some of the biggest cost blowouts are in the regions, especially in the mid west where the labour market is particularly stretched and hundreds of residents affected by Cyclone Seroja are waiting for work to be done on their homes and businesses. The Geraldton regional hospital expansion has blown out by $50 million, bringing its total cost to more than $122 million. Cost blowouts and delays have hurt the delivery of mental health facilities in Karratha and Broome, with the two step-up, step-down facilities set to cost a combined $3.9 million extra. The WA Government will put an extra $80 million towards the Bunbury Outer Ring road, pushing its cost to $1.25 billion, to deliver a scaled-back version of the south west's biggest road project. The budget also revealed the $250 million Pinjarra bypass road will take a back seat, with no significant work until 2025. Some key tourism projects – such as a new café and function centre at Perth Zoo, as well upgraded water infrastructure on Rottnest Island – will get multi-million dollar cash injections to deal with increased construction costs. The WA Government has also planned for construction cost blowouts in other areas of spending, including: But the budget also revealed the WA Government has set aside $350 million just in case there are further blowouts of construction costs. As the budget papers outline, there are many reasons for the ""cost escalation and supply chain constraints"" which are dramatically affecting its big infrastructure projects. These include: These problems appear to be affecting all parts of the economy, with the budget papers showing business investment only grew by 4.75 per cent, compared with a predicted 9.75 per cent, in 2021-22. ""Labour shortages and supply chain disruptions have resulted in some delays to investment spending, particularly for smaller non-mining businesses,"" the budget papers said. This budget was finalised on April 11, weeks before the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed Perth had the highest inflation in the country at 7.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Western Australia's reliance on China remains the cornerstone of the state's riches. While WA Treasury uses a different way of calculating inflation for its projections, the budget showed a 4 per cent growth in 2021-22, after five years of only growing an average of 1 per cent. ""Price pressures have accelerated in recent months, due to high global oil prices and supply chain disruptions from Omicron outbreaks (particularly in New South Wales and Victoria), as well as adverse weather events, such as flooding that caused the temporary closure of the east-west rail route between 21 January and 15 February 2022,"" the budget paper said.

21,We asked for your election questions. Here's what kept coming up,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency We asked ABC readers what they wanted to know about the federal election and what matters to them. So far we've received more than 7,000 submissions on dozens of topics. Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions. But if you have more questions, you can submit them via the form at the bottom. You can cast your vote now at a pre-polling booth. Pre-polling booths are open at various locations around the country. You can also cast a postal vote. Postal votes must be received by the AEC by the 13th day after the election. You can cast your vote at a polling booth on Saturday, May 21 between 8am and 6pm (local time). You number the candidates on the ballot paper in order from your first choice (1) to your last. Preferential votes are counted until one candidate gets more than half of all the votes. If your first choice doesn't get enough votes, your vote may be reallocated to your second choice. Voting below the line for the Senate means your vote goes directly to an individual candidate, rather the candidates preferenced by political parties. If you vote below the line, you must number at least 12 boxes from 1 to 12. There has never been an ability to vote in an Australian federal election on the internet using a personal device. The results of three NSW local government elections that used online voting in December 2021 were ruled as being invalid after the system malfunctioned. You can see where the major parties stand on different issues here in this handy guide. It covers a range of key policy areas for the major parties: the Coalition (Liberals and Nationals), Labor and the Greens. The ""teal independents"" are not a political party. It's a label that's been given to a group of mostly female candidates taking on mostly male Liberal MPs in some of Australia's wealthiest electorates. You can read a full profile on each electorate and its candidates here. A ghost candidate is a term the ABC is using to describe someone who has been nominated as a candidate for a seat but who has not been seen or heard from by the constituents of that electorate. An ABC investigation has found ""ghost"" candidates are contesting seats in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. You can still vote for a candidate who has resigned or been disendorsed. There have been instances where disendorsed candidates have run as independents and won. The Coalition (the Liberals and Nationals) has committed to net zero emissions by 2050. They plan to get there by investing more than $20 billion in ""low emissions technologies"" in the next decade. Labor has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, along with a 2030 target of a 43 per cent cut in emissions. The party plans to upgrade the electricity grid, make electric vehicles cheaper, install community batteries and modernise steel and aluminium productions. The Greens want a 75 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 and want to hit net zero by 2035. The Greens want to phase out coal and gas completely and switch to 100 per cent renewable energy usage as soon as possible. The Coalition plans to work with the private sector to increase the uptake of EVs, hybrids and hydrogen powered vehicles, and will fund 50,000 new EV chargers. Labor wants to upgrade the electricity grid and introduce an electric car discount. The Greens are pushing for an ""electric vehicle revolution"" and plan for all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. The Reserve Bank of Australia sets interest rates. The government generally does not set, or put a cap on, interest rates. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has advocated for the minimum wage to be lifted 5.1 per cent in line with inflation, but has stopped short of saying he would formally submit that figure to the independent wage umpire. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says a 5 per cent increase could take a real toll on small businesses. The Coalition halved the fuel excise in the federal budget ahead of the election in late March. But it's only temporary with the cut due to expire at 11:59pm on September 28, 2022. Labor has not offered to extend the fuel excise cut past September. The Coalition has announced plans to expand its first home buyers and its Family Home Guarantee schemes. Labor is offering to help 10,000 households a year into home ownership as part of a ""shared-equity"" scheme and will also expand the first home buyers scheme. In shared equity schemes, the government covers part of the cost of a property, that can then be bought by the home owner over time. These types of schemes are already run in Victoria and Western Australia. The National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) makes rent more affordable for 22,000 properties nationwide. It is due to end in June 2026. There is no further or replacement government incentive, though rent can't be changed until end of the lease period. ABC's election analyst Antony Green does not believe the UAP will be in a position of power to push the policy as, at most, it could get one Senate seat this election. Neither major party likely to form government — the Liberal/National Coalition or Labor — has indicated any support for the idea of a mortgage cap. The budget forecast deficits around $80 billion this financial year and in 2022-23. Over the longer term, the budget forecasts deficits for at least the next decade. Net debt is set to peak at $864 billion in 2026, which is an improvement on a $1 trillion forecast in previous budgets. The Coalition government is keeping the permanent migration cap at 160,000 places for 2022-23 but will increase the proportion of visas dedicated to skilled migrants to about 70 per cent. Labor has indicated it will announce a policy before the election to make it easier for foreign workers to become permanent residents. The Bureau of Statistics uses a labour force framework to calculate the rates of unemployment and participation. You can see an example of how that's done here. October 2022. Liberal Prime Minister Scott Morrison has effectively ditched his commitment to establish a national anti-corruption watchdog. Labor says, if elected, it would create a National Anti-Corruption Commission by the end of the year. The Greens want to see an independent National Integrity Commission created. Several high-profile independents have campaigned on establishing a national corruption watchdog as a key election commitment. Donations worth less than $14,300 do not need to be declared, meaning smaller fundraising drives by political parties will often not be included in the disclosures. It is also possible for large donations to be made with multiple cheques just under that threshold. Money donated to political parties in the 11 months before the May election will not be made public until February 2023. The Liberals are promising to have staff spend at least three hours and 20 minutes per day with each aged care resident from next year. At least one nurse would have to be on shift, across a minimum of 16 hours per day. The Coalition government has not publicly backed a case in the Fair Work Commission to raise aged care workers' wages. Labor is promising to have a registered nurse on site at all times of the day. It would require staff to spend at least three hours and 35 minutes with each resident — in line with the aged care royal commission's recommendation. Labor also supports the push for an increase to workers' wages and will fully fund any increase. Party leader Anthony Albanese has admitted the party will need to recruit overseas health workers as a ""stopgap"" measure. Anne Ruston, who has been nominated as the next health minister if the Coalition wins the election, says they will not cut Medicare. Labor says its long-term goal is for dental services to be included in Medicare, but has not stipulated a time frame to achieve that. The Greens are the only party with elected representatives in parliament promising to introduce universal access to free dental care. Dental is not included in Medicare because it was considered too complex and too expensive to include in the scheme. The Coalition says it'll lower the cost of medicines on the PBS by $10, meaning the maximum cost will be $32.50. Labor's gone slightly further than the Coalition, promising to lower the cost of medicines by $12.50 to a maximum cost of $30.

22,What's the fine for not voting? And other questions you might have before casting your vote,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency There is still more than a week left of campaigning, but already Australians have been voting in their thousands since pre-polling opened this week. If you've yet to to cast your vote, here's what you need to know: Short answer: yes. Compulsory voting means every eligible Australian citizen — aged 18 years or older — is required by law to enrol and to vote if eligible to do so. Australia is one of a small number of democratic countries that has compulsory voting. And, remember, for many, voting hasn't always been a default right. Feeling arty in the polling booth? According to the Australian Electoral Commission's recent Twitter activity, there are a few Aussies who do, too. Although, when it comes to certain drawings, they want you to know, it's not exactly original. “Scribbling or drawing on your ballot paper risks making your vote informal, and makes life harder for our counting staff,"" an AEC spokesperson said. While there is no blanket rule that invalidates doodled ballot papers, to ensure your vote is counted your choice of candidates must be clear. “When counting ballots we will always err on the side of the voter's intent but, if the boxes are not clearly numbered according to your preference, your ballot paper will be informal and your vote won’t be counted,"" the AEC spokesperson said. “We recommend following the instructions on the ballot paper, and refraining from including any drawings."" Yes. A donkey vote is where you number your vote in the same order that the candidates appear on the ballot. This can happen by accident or because a voter doesn't understand or care how to vote. If all the boxes are numbered, your vote will count. The fine is $20, this has been in place since 1984. What can happen if you don't vote? A Darwin-based pensioner learned this lesson the hard way, when he chose to miss the polling booth and then ignored the following three penalty notices asking to pay the $20 fine. He had to front court for violating section 245 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act of 1918 — and was given the maximum penalty. That was a fine of $180, plus his lawyer fees, which amounted to a total of $303. Yeah, nah. You still have to vote. With the federal election underway it can be hard to keep up with where each party stands on some of the key issues. We've made a little cheat sheet to make it easier. Disliking every candidate or having no preference is not considered a valid excuse. Votes that are not made correctly are known as informal votes and will not be counted. Informal votes can include ballot papers that are: More than 17.2 million Australians are enrolled for the upcoming 2022 federal election. AEC figures show that 16.4 million Australians were enrolled to vote in the 2019 federal election. Of this, 92 per cent voted. Voting has been compulsory in Australia since 1924. And, as such, it has one of the highest voter turnouts in the world. It depends. If you’re serving a full-time sentence of fewer than three years, yes — it’s compulsory to vote in the federal election. If you’re serving a sentence of three years or longer, no — you cannot vote in a federal election. There are two ways an enrolled prisoner can vote — that’s either by postal vote or by voting in person with a prison mobile polling team. Let's break down the climate change policies of the major parties: Coalition, Labor and Greens. Fear not. The AEC says a telephone voting option will be available as an emergency measure for people who test positive for COVID-19 after 6pm on Tuesday, May 17 — the final three voting days. While you can't vote online in the 2022 federal election, you certainly can vote early via either an early voting centre, a postal vote or via an AEC mobile polling team. Mobile polling teams visit voters not able to get to a polling place, such as hospitals, residential care facilities and remote areas of Australia. To find an early voting centre near you, the AEC has released its list of early polling centres, see here. This list will continually be updated until election day.

23,"With high prices and soaring rents, what are political parties promising to do about housing?",politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency If the great Australian dream is the security of owning your home, the election campaign might feel like waking late to discover the alarm on your phone has been ringing loudly for some time. There are a lot of problems in housing. For people who rent, vacancies are at record lows just as Australia re-opens borders largely shut since the COVID pandemic took off in 2020. For people paying mortgages, the Reserve Bank has just lifted rates and is set to keep doing so, making mortgage repayments more expensive. For people trying to buy, prices are cooling after rocketing up in recent years, but higher interest rates will reduce what banks can lend you. Is there an answer? In housing, there’s never going to be one that will fix every problem without creating losers elsewhere. But in the looming federal election, major and minor parties are proposing policies that could: Amanda Bingham lived in transitional housing for four years after fleeing family violence. ""Finding affordable rent is really quite stressful,"" she says. ""If you're on welfare payments or, like a lot of single mums — whether they work full time or part time — getting into the rental market is really, really hard.” Now living with her child in a rented house that is subsidised to be affordable, she is dubious about election promises that offer to put home ownership within reach. ""It seems like a bit of a quick fix or a bandaid to say we are going to helped by this policy,"" she says. ""[It suggests], 'Do this and home ownership is going to be affordable because of this.' But it can't be fixed that quickly. “I feel like if you don't have a really good job where you're getting paid a really good amount of money, there's just no room for you to even think about buying your own home"" CoreLogic data show home prices have surged 25 per cent during the pandemic (from April 2020 to February 2022). Will Australia's housing market be the same in the aftermath of the pandemic? Even though the market has started slowing more recently, house prices nationally have soared 16.1 per cent over the past 12 months, according to April data from PropTrack. Sydney and Hobart house prices fell for that month (by 0.1 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively) but still charted double-digit growth for the year. Regional areas saw a 23 per cent lift in prices to April. And some coastal centres have experienced astonishing jumps since the pandemic began. Rents are up too. Capital city asking rents jumped 11.8 per cent in the year to April, according to SQM Research. Brisbane recorded the largest yearly jump in combined house and unit asking rents, up 15.2 per cent. The Bureau of Statistics inflation figures — which look at all existing capital city rentals, not just properties currently advertised for lease – show a much smaller 1 per cent increase, although this is expected to catch up as more existing leases are renewed at higher rents. ANALYSIS: Catch-up on the latest from the campaign trail on Friday with Annabel Crabb ""There's no way for people to rent at an affordable rate if they're on a lower income,"" said Kate Colvin of Everybody's Home, a campaign that aims to fix what it sees as a national crisis in housing. ""The big issue over a long period of time in the housing market is that we haven't seen the investment into low-cost rental accommodation that we need."" ""We need to see the federal government investing in social housing growth — and in a significant amount of social housing growth."" Social housing is run by government or not-for-profit organisations and rents out homes for short and long terms at affordable rates. Ms Colvin says that, per head of population, social housing is shrinking. In 1994, it was 6 per cent of all housing in Australia. Today it is just 4 per cent. Among similar developed nations this is very low, close to that in Japan and the US. According to figures from the OECD, more than 37 per cent of housing in The Netherlands is social housing. In Denmark it's 22 per cent, in Great Britain around 18 per cent. Both major parties are promising to invest more in social housing. Labor’s $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund aims to build 30,000 new homes in its first five years. Returns from this initial investment would be provided to an existing body, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC), to pay for social and affordable housing projects. Labor says the funding would build 20,000 social housing properties in its first five years, with 4,000 allocated to women fleeing family violence and older women at risk of homelessness. A further 10,000 properties would be ""affordable"" for frontline workers like police and cleaners. A Sydney University economist is proposing a radical solution to dramatically improve housing affordability for first home buyers. The Coalition is also promising to support a similar number of dwellings but with a different funding model, allowing the corporation to make an additional $2 billion in low-cost loans to community housing providers. There is a dispute about how effective this is without dealing with a key issue: subsidising the ""gap"" between the cost of building social housing and the rents that people can afford to pay once it is completed. Everybody’s Home spokesperson Ms Colvin says both parties are committed to low-cost financing assisted by the corporation, but only Labor has committed to subsidising the production of more social housing. Getting the model right is a point of contention. What's not in dispute is the need, calculated in a 2018 report by some of Australia's leading housing academics. “The overall shortfall of social housing is 433,000 properties across the country,” it says. That requires a ""structural change"", according to Ms Colvin. ""We need to see the federal government back in the business of investing in social housing growth, and this is a step towards [that],"" she says. ""What we would need to see, for there to be a real change on the ground for people when they go looking for a rental property and expect to find one, is a larger program over time."" As house prices have surged, it's become harder for would-be buyers to get the deposit together. You need more than a million dollars to buy a median-priced house in Australia's two biggest capitals, meaning the standard 20 per cent deposit is at least $200,000. Saving that has become harder, with the growth in house prices far outstripping stubbornly low wage growth and very low interest rates on deposits. The government's Home Guarantee Scheme will next financial year allow up to 50,000 people to buy a home with as little as 5 per cent of the deposit (for 5,000 single parent families, just 2 per cent of the deposit). The government is expanding its home guarantee and the value of properties eligible for it, but experts warn there are risks as well as benefits for would-be buyers. Normally banks would make you pay for expensive Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) — to protect the lender — if you had less than the usual 20 per cent deposit. Under the scheme, the government will guarantee that part of the loan. The price of the properties you can buy is capped, with the caps below median home prices in some more expensive parts of the nation. But the deal comes with a risk: if property prices fall, you could be paying off a very large mortgage for ""negative equity"" — owing the bank more than the property is worth. If elected, Labor says it will support the expanded scheme. Labor’s key home ownership policy is a ""shared equity"" scheme that would help 10,000 people own homes by sharing the cost with them. The Help To Buy scheme sees people putting forward as little as little as 2 per cent of the deposit and the government holding as much as a 40 per cent stake in the property, effectively as a co-owner. That portion could then be bought back by the home owner over time, or the government would recoup its share whenever the property was next sold. Making housing more affordable by making it cheaper seems to be electoral death. But there may be other ways to help first-time buyers into the market, writes Michael Janda. The scheme also avoids the need for lenders mortgage insurance and is open to people earning less than $90,000, or couples earning less than $120,000. Similar schemes are in operation in some states, most notably Western Australia's long-running Keystart program. The Labor Party estimates its scheme could cut the up-front cost of a new home by up to $380,000 for some buyers in the most expensive markets and reduce the burden of mortgage repayments. Non-partisan think tank the Grattan Institute floated the idea earlier this year, but acknowledged that it could add to property demand putting some upward pressure on prices. Many of these schemes being proposed, along with the temporary HomeBuilder stimulus scheme that gave people $25,000 for renovations or new homes, and state-based schemes to assist first home buyers, add to demand. That increases the amount of people who can buy and how much they can pay, pushing up prices, but doesn't increase the amount of housing. ""Supply is ready to drop through the floor,"" Ken Morrison, chief executive of the Property Council of Australia, says. He points to NHFIC’s State of the Nation’s Housing 2021-22 research report that flags a future shortage of housing. The research suggests new supply will outpace demand by 115,300 dwellings in 2022 and 35,500 in 2023. But after that, with migration increasing and new households forming, supply falls short by about 20,000 units of housing a year. By 2032 we’ll be an estimated 163,400 dwellings short. ""We are moving back into this dangerous scenario where supply for housing will be dropping right at the time that demand will be increasing,"" he says. ""So we need more action on the housing supply: on zoning, on the planning rules that support new housing coming through the system, if we're able to meet this present crisis and future crises."" What’s holding back more houses? Standing in a half-completed house on the north-western fringe of Melbourne, Dan Senia, general manager of First Place Building Company, is struggling with increasing costs that he can't pass on. ""It's a bit of everything at the moment,"" he explains. ""What we're seeing is a perfect storm now of cost increases coming out of a shortage of raw materials, and cost increases coming from a shortage of qualified trades that we can get access to."" Mr Senia points to delays for timber, a doubling in the cost of steel, and a general ""20 to 30 per cent cost increase in the last year alone"" for materials. Soaring fuel prices also have an impact. Supply and labour shortages plus surging costs are leaving Australia's building sector in crisis. First home buyers are very sensitive to costs. Some are paying off a loan for the land before engaging a builder, so the company has been subsidising the rent of more than 50 clients as delays take a toll. After 20 years in the industry across Melbourne, Mr Senia wants to see local council processes speed up, but he isn't sold on the help that federal deposit schemes will provide. ""There's a fundamental issue. And it's all good and well for the government to go and basically create a shadow mortgage over the property for first-time buyers … but their policy isn't aligning to bank lending criteria,"" he argues. The government's home guarantee scheme — avoiding costly lenders mortgage insurance — was over-subscribed. But 4,651 of the spots later came back on the market. ""And the reason why is because that lending criteria doesn't marry up with the criteria to get the grant,"" Mr Senia says. ""If you've got, for instance, a single individual earning $125,000 … you're probably still not going to meet the banking criteria and repayment criteria for a $700,000 or $800,000 loan. ""So there's a discrepancy between qualifying for the grant and qualifying for a loan."" Despite there being more than 8 million people renting, renters haven't been a major target of election promises so far. In Australia, roughly a third of people own their home, a third have a mortgage and a third rent. That propels the conversations — and policy — about housing. Anglicare Australia executive director Kasy Chambers says superannuation and age pension payments, for example, are framed around people living on that money when they own homes outright. ""We always seem to talk about the price of housing for people who are buying it,"" she says. ""We have an historical hangover in Australia where we think of people in the private rental market as [being in] a transitionary stage in people's housing journey."" But with the price of housing — both rents and purchases — soaring, that's no longer true. ""We're seeing more and more people rent for longer and longer,"" she says. Anglicare Australia's latest snapshot of almost 50,000 listings on the private rental market found just 2 per cent were affordable for a minimum wage earner, and just 1 per cent for someone on welfare payments. “I think we've ignored rental at our peril for a long time,” Ms Chambers says. The Liberal/National Coalition and the Labor Party both hope to govern in their own right after the May 21 election. If they fail to secure a majority of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives, however, they'll need the support of independents or members of another party. The Greens currently hold one seat in the House of Representatives and nine in the Senate, where there are 76 seats. This has made them a powerful voting bloc, as legislation needs to pass both houses to become law. The Greens propose to build a million homes over 20 years: 750,000 public and community homes, 125,000 shared-ownership homes and 125,000 government-owned homes where rent would be capped at 25 per cent of income. Based on current opinion polling, Clive Palmer's United Australia Party is not expected to win any seats in the lower house and is considered by ABC election analyst Antony Green to be only an outside chance of gaining one Senate seat. But it is proposing an ambitious policy to hold interest rates on mortgages to 3 per cent. It would be difficult. The Reserve Bank is independent of the government, and Australia's big banks — the mortgage holders of most of Australia’s home loans — are private companies listed on the stock exchange. Zac Gross, a lecturer in economics at Monash University, told ABC News Radio a cap would be ""costly"" and would either undermine bank profits and threaten financial stability, or cost a large amount through either higher taxes or higher inflation. ""If they can't make a profit when lending mortgages out to Australian households, then they're going to stop making those mortgages in the first place,"" he warns. Dr Gross adds that banks would likely restrict loans to the ""safest bets"": wealthy people. There are no easy solutions. Cameron Kusher, executive manager of economic research at REA Group, notes that investors — who buy properties and then rent them out — have been departing the market since 2014. ""And then when the pandemic hit, that selling by investors really was supercharged,"" he says. Currently about 20 per cent of real estate sales are by investors, but only about 8 per cent of purchases are by investors who will then rent them out, so the situation will get tighter. The number of properties available for rent at the moment is about 30 per cent lower than the average over the past decade. That squeeze means lower vacancy rates and higher rents. ""It is a challenge that's not going to be really fixed very quickly,"" he cautions. ""Apartment projects take a long time to build. Some state governments are looking to build social housing and, again, that type takes time to construct."" For renters like Amanda Bingham, there's no comfort in the endless pursuit of stable housing. ""That's something that I really want for me and my child, a stable house that I can call my own and I can paint the walls and I can do that,"" she says. ""So, yeah, the feeling [now] is good, but it's temporary. It's not a long-time secure feeling.""

24,What are 'ghost' candidates and why are we talking about these invisible blow-ins?,politics," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Since we first wrote about the non-appearance of mysterious candidates standing for Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party (PHON) in the federal election, the ABC has been flooded with tip-offs from readers, listeners and viewers with more non-sightings. And not just about One Nation candidates. So far, we know these ""ghost"" candidates are contesting seats in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. But some of these candidates live as far afield as Queensland and Tasmania. They’re totally legal, but some voters think it’s a bit strange. Here’s what you need to know about them. A ghost candidate is a term we are using to describe someone who has been nominated as a candidate for a seat but who has not been seen or heard from by the constituents of that electorate. They do not appear to engage in any of the usual campaigning we associate with aspiring to serve your fellow Australians in the House of Representatives. But they are real people, just a bit publicity-shy. We've also referred to them as invisible candidates. And ghosts are known for their invisibility, right? ANALYSIS: Catch-up on the latest from the campaign trail on Friday with Annabel Crabb So far, we've counted about a dozen people who fit this category. The other thing about these ghosts is that many of them live far away from the seats they're supposed to be contesting. This is probably why they're not being seen on the ground of the electorate they're contesting. For instance, Vanessa Atkinson is the One Nation candidate for the seat of Mallee in Victoria. But she lives 1,500 kilometres away, near Bundaberg in Queensland. Good question. We're still getting to the bottom of this. Part of the reason may be for branding purposes. You want to show that you have nationwide support, that you're not just a fringe party tucked away in one corner of the country. Part of it may have to do with preference deals: You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. And part of it may be about qualifying for electoral funding. Candidates must win at least 4 per cent of the primary vote to get their deposit back and to be eligible for funding from the electoral commission. Please use this form to get in contact with the ABC Investigations team, or if you require more secure communication, please choose an option on the confidential tips page. Funny you should ask. The ghost candidates we have spoken to have not been very forthcoming with details. Most of them refer us to head office and head office is not returning our emails or calls. Away from the cameras, candidates are fighting for your vote: in your social media feed, on your phone and in your letterbox. Help us uncover these hidden tactics. Presumably, they're not stumping up the $2,000 nomination fee. Maybe it's because they want to serve their party or get selected to a seat closer to home next time? Clive Palmer's United Australia Party is running candidates in all of the 151 electorates. And the Australian Federation Party, another fringe party, is contesting 61 of those 151 seats. But it's not clear yet if there are any out-of-town blow-ins. Certainly not on the industrial scale we are seeing in this campaign. The AEC has told the ABC that there is ""no law against candidates living outside of the seat or state/territory they are running in"". Andrew Charlton, for instance, Labor's star candidate for the seat of Parramatta in Sydney's west lives in Bellevue Hill in the city's east. But, on the whole, parties like to pick locals because they are seen to be more in touch with, you know, local issues. It makes perfect sense. The AEC spokesperson added: ""There is also nothing that requires a candidate to be active in campaigning for election. However, clearly, that would be advantageous if you're genuinely seeking election.""
