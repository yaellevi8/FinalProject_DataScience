1,Timed eBay-style online auctions shake up the power dynamic of high-stakes property purchases,house-and-home,"  New eBay-style online property auctions offer transparency as Australian buyers bid from home For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency When Tyler Hoggard and Jess Farrell recently bought their first house in Wollongong, the auction took place in the kitchen of the Mount Pleasant home that is now theirs. They had walked around the place, loved it and already pictured what life would look like living there. ""It [being there] definitely made an impact on the emotional connection, as it's always hard to properly gauge the quality of a home from photos and videos,"" Mr Hoggard said. It is this emotional connection real estate agents bank on at auctions, but technology could end up nullifying the effect as more bidders are raising their hands from their home or office. Timed online auctions are like buying a house on eBay, away from the theatre and pressure of a live onsite auction. ""I think that bidding online would have made for an entirely different experience and it would be much easier to let it go when the bidding had already gone further than we intended,"" Mr Hoggard said. ""While we went into the auction with a strategy in mind, most of it went out the window after the first few bids. ""There's a strong sense of urgency that comes with being present in the room."" Wollongong real estate agent Neil Webster recently sold a house in Shellharbour using a timed online auction. He said while the technology might not be best for every property, it offered a level of transparency that added credibility to his industry. ""There's a perception that real estate agents aren't the most trustworthy of people, it's a hark back to the bygone era when agents would do some dubious practices at times,"" he said. ""By using these platforms, we can operate in a more transparent way because people register, they're bidding and it's like eBay. ""You get notified every time an offer is made and you know someone is genuinely out there bidding against you."" He said the online auction gave buyers more time to consider their options than an onsite auction. If a higher bid comes in just before the auction closes, another five minutes is added to the auction each time the highest bid is exceeded. ""Sometimes the auction can go past the defined time because we have people throwing in that little bit more,"" Mr Webster said. ""That's what you'd be doing at an auction with the auctioneer saying, 'First call', 'Second call', then I can talk to the buyers. ""And online, it's the same process — I'm calling the underbidder to see if they have more in the tank and if they'll put another offer in."" By taking someone away from the front lawn or the kitchen of the property they are bidding on, an online auction can sever some of the attachment to a property. ""Being onsite definitely heightened the stakes,"" Mr Hoggard said. ""It gave us the opportunity to walk around inside the home and picture how we would live in different spaces."" Neil Webster knows it might end up swinging some control back towards the bidder at an auction, which is why real estate agents may still choose onsite auctions for properties people are more likely to live in. ""Having people stand on the front lawn or in the kitchen of the house they're trying to buy has a greater impact in terms of getting you emotionally involved in the sale process and once that aspect is removed, it takes away the connection to the property,"" he said. ""If you're buying as an investment, it's a different thing – you're doing it online where it's a business decision and you're [the agent] encouraging people to buy based on price and investment return.""

3,New Adelaide shop to sell second-hand building materials to raise money for Habitat for Humanity,house-and-home,"  New Habitat for Humanity shop ReStore to sell new and second-hand building materials in Adelaide For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A charity store in Adelaide's north-west is the first of its kind to launch in South Australia, selling new and second-hand donated building materials at discounted prices. The Alberton shop, called ReStore, sells new or gently used furniture, paving and plumbing materials, as well as lighting and bathroom fixtures that have been donated by building companies, businesses and individuals. It is an initiative that has been 15 years in the making for not-for-profit organisation Habitat for Humanity, which builds homes for disadvantaged families and apartments for homeless youth. The organisation's South Australian executive officer, Louise Hay, said it would be a relief to officially open the doors to the public on Saturday. ""Everybody has greeted us with such vigour and such interest,"" she said. ""Anybody who is interested in purchasing anything for their home is more than welcome; we're not about just helping low-income [people]."" Ms Hay said ReStore would act as a social enterprise, providing the organisation with a funding mechanism to continue its social housing programs. ""The money that we raise here is what will go back into our programs — so it'll go back into the building the homes for the disadvantaged,"" she said. The organisation has so far built more than 40 homes and apartments for South Australians struggling with shelter. Customer Debbie Richardson said it made shopping easier ""knowing that what you buy, that the money goes to housing people as well as feeling good about keeping things from landfill and having a nice buy for your house"". ""It just gives you an opportunity to perhaps buy something that you might have to save up for or you wouldn't get otherwise,"" Ms Richardson said. Port Adelaide Enfield Mayor Claire Boan hoped the shop would also become a hub for recycling. ""We're certainly looking at ways that we can work together in terms of saving some of the refuse that we put out for hard rubbish that can be collected and saved,"" she said. ""Rather than going to landfill, it can come back into this place for sustainability purposes. ""Why would we put something out into the dump if we can actually use it and put it to good use?""

5,Campbell bought this 110yo church for $26K. He and Caroline renovated it and are now mortgage-free,house-and-home,"  Young couple turn ageing church into divine new home and are now mortgage-free For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A young couple have transformed a decaying country church into a new home, with locals ecstatic a piece of their history has been restored. Campbell Michell had only renovated a couple of small rooms before he found the Pinnaroo Methodist Church, about two hours east of Adelaide near the Victorian border, in 2016. The 110-year-old building was in a state of disrepair after the congregation moved out a decade earlier and storms had caused further damage. It was being considered for demolition and the church committee was ready to pay $45,000 to have it torn down. But that's when Mr Michell was visiting family in the town and put in a bid of $26,000 to purchase the church and save the building. ""When I first walked into the big hall here, I could just see how cool it was with the light shining in and I wanted to build a home that kept that feel,"" he said. ""But I also wanted it to be a modern thing with a lot of stairs and a fun English-manor kind of vibe. ""I think we hit it pretty well."" Mr Michell, who is a cabinet maker by trade, met his partner Caroline Forster three years ago after the project had started. Ms Forster has taken the lead on much of the interior design since she came into the picture. ""There was so much work to do and I did underestimate how much there was to do,"" he said. ""It was hard because the cracks were pretty intensive, the original foundations weren't up to modern standards and had deteriorated pretty badly over 110 years. ""It took a while of sweat and blood to chip at the old stuff, put the new stuff in and get it done."" The church was opened in 1912 and served as a town hall and meeting place during its early days. The large hall out the back was built to cater for the burgeoning Sunday school, which was attracting more students than the local area school. Local historian and church member Max Wurfel said Mr Michell and Ms Forster had saved what was an important building to the town's residents. ""As a congregation it was something we still had to maintain even though we weren't using it,"" he said. ""So to have someone come along and take it over was really good for us and the committee. It's really nice that it's still there. ""I'm pleased that they were able to get it and really do something with it."" The couple recently held an open day so locals could walk through and see the transformation to the building where many of them worshipped, were married and gathered with their friends. ""The town has been so supportive and it's been amazing to do a final reveal for them and have them walk through the house,"" Ms Forster said. ""Lots of them were married here and had funerals and baby showers here. ""They're all really happy with the progress and are just happy to see it being used instead of it going derelict."" Want more local news? Sign up to ABC Riverland's weekly email newsletter. Ms Forster added the renovation had educated the couple about the town they now called home. The large stained-glass windows that rise up inside the main hall bear the names of the town's early residents, each with a story their descendants have been keen to tell. The couple have added their names to the windows, signifying a new era for the church. ""We had a storm come through a year back and it actually damaged one of the windows,"" Mr Michell said. ""Rather than leave it how it was, we replicated the original windows and wrote on there that it was restored by us to add a bit of our own flavour. ""It's also to say thank you to our families too, the Michell and Forster families, because they put in a lot of time and money to help us with this and we're very grateful for that."" Now mortgage-free and ready to begin the next chapter of their lives, Ms Forster said living in the church felt like a ""dream"". ""Waking up in the morning to the church still doesn't feel real,"" she said. ""We're pretty young, we're mortgage-free and we have this awesome home.""

6,What Queensland home owners need to know about the state's fire alarm legislation,house-and-home,"  Queensland fire alarm legislation — what home owners need to know For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A recent tragedy has put Queensland's fire alarm legislation back on the radar for home owners who must comply with strict new rules by 2027. The Easter long weekend ended in tragedy when six-year-old Max Chirila died in a house fire in Brisbane's inner north on Monday. The Fire and Emergency Services (Domestic Smoke Alarms) Amendment Act 2016 (Qld) commenced on January 1, 2017 and imposed additional obligations on property owners and managers regarding the installation and maintenance of smoke alarms at domestic dwellings. If the existing smoke alarms were manufactured less than 10 years ago and are still in good working order, they can remain in place until 2027 when the smoke alarms are required to be AS 3786-2014 compliant. But that's just for owner-occupiers. Since January 1 this year, where properties were sold, leased or having a lease renewed, interconnected photoelectric smoke alarms must be installed. The Queensland Fire and Emergency Services website states that smoke alarms in the dwelling must also be less than 10 years old; operate when tested; and be interconnected with every other smoke alarm in the dwelling so all activate together. They must not also include an ionisation sensor. Smoke alarms must be installed on each storey, in each bedroom; in hallways that connect bedrooms and the rest of the dwelling or, if there is no hallway, between the bedrooms and other parts of the storey. If there are no bedrooms on a storey, at least one smoke alarm must be installed in the most likely path of travel to exit the dwelling. Smoke alarms must be hardwired or powered by a non-removable 10-year battery, or a combination of both may be allowed. Queensland Fire Alarms & Compliance's Jason Lee said the stipulation that smoke alarms be connected was to ensure occupants of a home were alerted to a fire in any part of the property. ""If there's smoke in a downstairs area, the smoke alarm should go off in an upstairs area too,"" he said. ""The laws have come out for a reason. If you're in a two-storey house you own and the downstairs fire alarm is not interconnected you may not know about a fire in time. ""Only an interconnected fire alarm will give you sufficient time to get out."" Mr Lee said photoelectric smoke alarms could ""see smoke before they sense it inside"" and owners should install the devices as soon as possible. He said the cost to upgrade a smoke alarm system started from about $120 per alarm, excluding labour. Editor's note An earlier version of this story mistakenly used the word hardwired instead of interconnected in this sentence: Since January 1 this year, where properties were sold, leased or having a lease renewed, interconnected photoelectric smoke alarms must be installed.

7,Renovation blowout: We spent a record $12b doing up our homes during the pandemic,house-and-home,"  Home renovation spending soars to $12b as locked-down Aussies extend, beautify their houses For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australians have spent more on home renovations during the pandemic years than at any other time since records began 50 years ago. New data shows how houseproud we became, particularly once the initial shock of the pandemic began to wear off. As COVID landed, spread and paralysed much of Australian life, with state and international borders closed and entire cities locked down, we began spending more on renovations — up 10 per cent to $9.2 billion. But last year it must have felt safer to bet the house, with Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showing renovators poured a massive $12.3 billion into renovating their homes, up 33 per cent on 2020. That's almost double what we spent on renovations just 10 years ago. Alongside the pandemic forcing us to stay home was the Federal HomeBuilder scheme that paid out between $15,000 and $25,000 to  those willing to undertake a major renovation. It was designed as a stimulus measure in response to COVID, and since its launch, almost 25,000 renovators have applied. But not everyone was driven by the promise of free money — others were already designing their dream renovation before COVID arrived. Morgan McGahan was one of them, and she was not about to allow a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic to derail her plans. Her family bought their seaside home on the Sunshine Coast almost 10 years ago for about $400,000. In 2019, they had already begun planning to convert their ageing beach shack into a two-storey home with water views. Ms McGahan said moving did not feel like an option, because this was the only home her seven-year-old son Watson and five-year-old daughter Evelyn had known. ""This is a really special spot for us,"" she said. ""We got married out on that beach, we brought our two babies home here. ""We knew that that's what we wanted to do, to renovate and build on what we had already created – just with a little bit more room for the children."" Demolition at the Golden Beach site began just as Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and chief health officer Jeannette Young ordered the entire state to stay at home, and that most businesses be shut down. Although building could continue, they could not escape the spectre of COVID. ""We didn’t know if we would have any job security,"" she said. ""Once we had realised that we were safe in our jobs, and that yes, we can actually pay for this renovation with what's going on, and all the craziness – it continued to flow from there."" Zane McCarthy from Top Plate Building was the renovating builder behind the McGahans' project. He said it was no surprise to him that renovation numbers were breaking records. ""Oh mate, we are flat out — we get enquiries, probably two to three a week, and everyone's renovating,"" he said. The HomeBuilder grant was one of the biggest stimulus injections the housing industry had ever seen, but for those who missed out, it created turmoil. He said people were watching their house values go up, but it was often not enough to buy something bigger. ""I think everyone's at home watching the house value go up and thinking, 'I can borrow some money here'. ""And to buy a new house somewhere else is just not affordable."" Mr McCarthy said one of his projects was a major renovation so the daughter could live nearby. ""They looked at house prices … in the area and it wasn't affordable so they're renovating this place and they're all staying together."" The housing crisis across parts of the country is now critical, with those unable to buy also being turned away from the rental market. Pastor Dale Dowler, from The Shack Community Centre on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, has spent decades working with those either sleeping rough or at risk of homelessness. Will Australia's housing market be the same in the aftermath of the pandemic? He said the rise in renovations might mean higher rents for homeowners, but it also meant fewer affordable homes for those who needed it. ""People are investing in homes and then putting it back on the rental market, but it has priced a lot of community out of that rental market,"" he said. ""We've had families that are still sending their kids to school, but they're living in vans."" And he uses himself as an example, after paying to renovate his own home so his children have a place to call home. ""We bought our house 18 years ago and the cost was $116,000 – that same renovated house now is over $700,000."" It is not just the price of homes that is more expensive. A national lack of building supplies is likely to become more intense as parts of the country rush to rebuild after devastating floods. Mr McCarthy said while his projects continued, there had to be a knock-on effect from the flood disasters. ""It's already affecting us now,"" he said. ""We're probably already delayed a week to get materials we already ordered. ""It's going to be hell for 12 months.""

8,He ran his air conditioner all through Perth's record-breaking summer. The bill? Just $35 a month,house-and-home,"  Loose building standards let homes overheat in summer, stay cold in winter, passive house advocate says For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency When Carlos Acuna and his family moved to Perth 10 years ago, they ""quickly fell in the love with place"". ""We got our permanent residency, and recently our citizenship. We've just loved it here and feel really fortunate to be in a place like this,"" he said. ""But the one thing that really impacted us, and impacts a lot of expats, is how uncomfortable the homes are here."" Around a fifth of new homes built in Western Australia do not have meet six-star energy standards, costing their owners dearly in running costs. Architects say it's time for a re-think. Seattle averages between 4-8 degrees Celsius in winter, while Perth's average winter temperatures are 10-18C, but the family found the houses they rented in Australia the coldest they had ever experienced. ""[The houses are] cold, they're ice chests,"" he said. ""In winter, they're colder than homes I can remember in Seattle, and definitely hard to cool down in the summer. ""We had very high electric bills in the summer to keep the house comfortable."" After years in rented houses, both old and new and that were all hard to keep at comfortable temperatures, he decided to build a highly insulated, airtight house that used passive heating and cooling design to keep the indoor temperature at between 20-25C all year round. He began talking to builders, but found that standards that were common in North America were not a part of most builds in Australia. ""We knew that we wanted a house to be built more towards an American standard, if you will, in terms of insulation and airtightness,"" he said. ""When we started talking with designers and builders, the insulation part was sort of known, but the air tightness was just really a topic that was really unheard of. ""Air tightness is maybe not as obvious, but if you have the best insulation in the world with gaps that allow cold air to escape in the summer, or hot air escaping in the winter, comfort in the house is going to be very difficult to maintain."" He said that every new North American home is tested for airtightness using what is called a ""blower door test"". It measures the number of air exchanges per hour inside a house, showing how quickly cooled or heated air is escaping from the home. In Australia, the current National Construction Code (NCC) requires new homes to be built to do 10 air exchanges per hour or fewer, but does not require blower door testing at the completion of a build to verify the standard has been met. Eight million Australian homes contribute 18 per cent of Australia's carbon emissions, a new report shows. Enacting any major change is especially hard for renters and people in low-income households. ""These are energy efficiency measures that started in the US and Europe with the Iran oil embargo in the 70s,"" Mr Acuna said. ""So today, a typical project builder in the US will achieve three air changes per hour, which is fantastic. ""By time you get below five you have a pretty well-performing and comfortable home that's fairly easy to cool or heat, and it won't escape through the holes."" Mr Acuna said in Australia no testing is required, and he suspects many new builds are not even meeting the six-star energy standards. ""The challenge with those standards is they're written in a way that makes them very unenforceable,"" he said. ""Over the seven years [we rented] older homes that were built in the '70s, and a couple of homes that were recently built to the six star standard, there was really no appreciable difference in performance."" After an extensive search, the Acunas opted for a German Passivhaus design which uses thick, insulated walls and double glazing with tight seals to create an extraordinarily airtight building that, when tested, allows only 0.6 air exchanges per hour. ""The German Passivhaus standard is the most energy efficient standard in the world right now,"" he said. The home is so airtight it needs mechanical ventilation to introduce fresh air and prevent mould, but it also means that a double storey, 200-square-metre, four-bedroom house uses just two small reverse-cycle air conditioners for heating and cooling. While the build was much more expensive than a typical new home, its average heating and cooling costs — which fluctuate with the season — are around just $35 a month. It allows the family to make the most of Perth's climate while staying comfortable. ""When the weather's nice outside, as it is for large parts of the year in Perth, we can open up our windows and allow fresh air in and out,"" Mr Acuna said. ""But as soon as it gets too cold or too hot we can close the doors and windows and know that the heating or cooling that you're pumping into the house is not escaping."" The house has two small split system air-conditioners — one upstairs, one downstairs — which can stay on for months in summer and winter, keeping the temperature consistent. ""We've been living here since January 2019 and we've never had a summer where this space is at more than 23 degrees,"" he said. Despite the energy saving, the high cost of a PassivHaus means it is probably not for everyone. But Mr Acuna believes raising standards, and testing, on conventional builds could make a big difference in all new homes. ""Leaky homes"" are hard to keep warm in winter and cool in summer, but there are simple ways to fix them. ""The building associations are very hesitant to embrace some of these new standards like airtightness, and they're trying to delay the government's implementation as late as they can,"" he said. ""But I do think that people are starting to hear more about this. ""And the truth is it's not difficult to build in a draught-free building envelope. It just needs some attention to detail really. ""Builders are doing it in the rest of the developed world, it's just a matter of time before the builders here learn how to do it, and they'll be doing it for the same cost that they're building houses now."" And he now enjoys winters without freezing. ""You wake up in the morning at five or six to take a shower and the house is at 18 degrees,"" he said. ""In the first winter that was fantastic for us because we'd been living in homes that were at 10 degrees in the morning.""

9,'This is for sale?': Why Natasha left a tiny city unit to run a 180yo country homestead with a big history,house-and-home,"  Historic Narracoorte Homestead in hands of a loving, if 'overwhelmed', Natasha Biggins For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency In June 2021, Natasha Biggins was trying to sell a wardrobe. After living in cities around the world she was based in a one-bedroom unit in Adelaide. ""The people that came to look at [the wardrobe], I ended up selling them my whole house,"" Natasha said. A fourth-generation sheep farmer from Naracoorte on South Australia's Limestone Coast, the pandemic had her seriously questioning where she wanted to bide her time. An offer from her brother to house-sit his farm for a few weeks directed her next steps. ""I went from living in my one-bedroom unit with no pets to looking after ... five thousand sheep, three cats, four dogs … chopping all my own firewood,"" Natasha said. ""I was absolutely exhilarated by that."" A chance encounter with Narracoorte Homestead weeks later stirred her to buy the three-acre site, Naracoorte's first dwelling, with little thought. After 10 years on the market, the historic property was back in local hands. ""I have been inundated by support from the community,"" Natasha said. ""They're just so happy someone is finally here and taking care of the place."" Managing the three dwellings and surrounding gardens is no light task. While experienced in business and tourism, Natasha has had to quickly learn about English cottage gardens, stone masonry and irrigation systems for the property's reopening as a bed and breakfast this Easter. ""I feel like I'm a bit of an Alice in Wonderland. I'm a bit overwhelmed by it all,"" she said. ""I'm the one that's now custodian of all this."" Unaware of the homestead until her mid-20s, Natasha did not know it was on the market until a walk with her mum in August 2021. ""We actually went to about three or four different locations to try and get away from the wind and we ended up walking past here and the sale sign out the front that had sat there for 10 years,"" Natasha said. ""I went, are you kidding me? This is for sale? I need to see if this is a viable option."" It was. Although it was a while before she could get in and have a look. ""Unfortunately, South Australia had gone into a mini lockdown that week,"" Natasha said. Previously restored and run as a bed and breakfast, the place was in pretty good nick. The main homestead was the last building added to the site and consists of four bedrooms and living and dining rooms. A kitchen has been added in more recent years. ""The cooking facilities were previously in another building so they didn't burn the house down,"" Natasha said. The first thing to be built on the site was a lime-washed stone cottage — Naracoorte's first dwelling — in 1842. ""George Ormerod who built that is most well known in the area for going down to Robe and then setting up his businesses down there,"" Natasha said. ""William Macintosh bought it from him and obviously he's got his stamp all over Naracoorte."" After adding a three-floor building to the site he eventually sold it to Thomas and Elizabeth Magarey who built the main homestead. ""It's such a small space and the three most significant families in this town's history have each put their stamp on one building,"" Natasha said. ""The roads in Naracoorte, Magarey Crescent, William Mackintosh Hotel and Ormerod Street ... they're all the guys that were associated with this property."" While the homestead is considered a lavish residence now, Natasha believes Naracoorte's ""forefathers"" did not have anything like the finery in there today. ""I think they were really quite humble and really quite low key and conservative, agricultural people,"" Natasha says. Natasha has recruited the help of Judy Murdoch, an 88-year-old historian — and her former high school teacher — to collate the property's history. ""She's very happily handing over all of her information to me,"" Natasha said. Prior to Natasha's ownership, history of the property has remained scattered. ""For some reason it just hasn't been something that people had the time to focus on here,"" she said. ""They go through droughts and floods and everything here. And it just hasn't been the thing that was important to people."" Locals have gotten in touch with extra anecdotes and personal connections to the place. She is relying on one neighbour to help her link in with the local Meintangk community to document the site's earliest inhabitants. ""[There are] scarred trees here that have been identified as 450 and 500 years old ... you can see a shield and a canoe have been cut out of them,"" Natasha said. ""I think it's really important for us to understand that there was a lot more that happened there. ""There's a little more history than these guys and their buildings."" The spelling of Narracoorte Homestead is intentional and nods to the Indigenous word meaning large waterhole, or place of running water. ""I think it's possibly because the creek was here and there may have been a lot of low-lying water before we did this drainage work in the area to make it more accessible for farming,"" Natasha said.

10,COVID turbocharged rental prices in Australia — but not in the major cities,house-and-home,"  Pandemic, 'missed opportunities', need for space fuelling Australia's housing crisis, report says For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Business owner Jack Evans and his partner are relying on family to get a good deal in the home rental market. The report finds regional rents have risen by 18 per cent since the start of the pandemic People's desire for more space to adapt to isolation and working from home requirements have been identified as a factor Government stimulus packages are identified as another key driver in the soaring prices ""We're renting a property owned by a family member, so we've actually negotiated a price for rent that is probably below what the current inflated market value is,"" he said. Mr Evans lives in Orange in regional NSW where rents rose by 20 per cent in the first 15 months of the pandemic. He said he was stuck in the rental market because he still could not afford to buy a house, something he has been trying to do since moving back to his home town four years ago. ""It's gone up quite substantially and it's still a struggle,"" Mr Evans said. It is a common story across regional Australia, according to a new report released today by the University of NSW (UNSW) and the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS). The study, which examined trends in Australia and eight other countries, found low interest rates, government income support, people's ""pent-up savings"" and their desire for houses instead of units, drove the surge in prices. It showed rental prices in regional areas had risen by 18 per cent in the two years to late 2021, whereas in metropolitan areas rents had only just recovered to pre-pandemic levels. ""People have been willing to pay more for more space, so this is this term 'race for space',"" lead author Hal Pawson said. Professor Pawson said in Orange and other areas, at the same time as people flocked from Sydney under working from home arrangements, ""fewer properties [were] being made available on the market"" and that put significant pressure on rentals. The report showed house prices have increased by 19 per cent in Australia, compared with 22 per cent in New Zealand, 17 per cent in Canada, and 12 per cent in the UK. With his rent set to almost double, George Parkyn and his dog, Baxter, could be homeless in a few weeks. He says there's no way he can afford to lease a property in the open market, and he's far from the only one. Professor Pawson said, while popular economic stimuli during the pandemic helped avert a predicted 30 per cent slump in house prices, they came at a price. ""One of the effects of the monetary stimulus, trying to keep the economy going, is it's had this sort of negative side-effect of pumping up the housing market in a way that has been quite damaging,"" he said. ""By making cash grants available on a bigger scale than usual, I think with hindsight it is something that they probably should be regretting now because that only compounded the spike in house prices that we've seen over the past year or just over a year."" While much of the stimuli introduced during the pandemic had fallen by the wayside, Professor Pawson said the impacts of some made a case for long-term change. The report noted that the lifting of other government interventions to protect tenants, such as moratoriums on evictions and price increases, had exacerbated the rental crisis. ""That shone a light on a possible future that we've decided that 'No, we don't want that, we'll go back to what it was before',"" Professor Pawson said. He said the doubling of job seeker payments for a period of time was ""a very insightful response"" and that it was a ""missed opportunity"" when it reverted to ""one of the lowest rates of social security payments among OECD countries"". ""That's an overdue reform, which I think a lot of economists would agree is something that Australia should be contemplating anyway,"" Professor Pawson said.

11,This essential guide can help you flood-proof your home,house-and-home,"  Flood design tips you should know before building or buying a home For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The architecture firm behind Queensland's flood-proofing guide says people who have adopted its building and design recommendations are saving money on their insurance premiums and getting back into their homes faster. The Flood Resilient Building Guidance for Queensland Homes authored by Brisbane company James David Architect (JDA) was put to the test during the state's recent flood disaster — and it worked. More than 140 homes upgraded in line with the guidance through Brisbane City Council's (BCC) flood resilience program were better protected during last month's deluge, allowing families to clean up and safely move back in within days. JDA founder James Davidson said strategies like raising power points and sealing floors using skirting tiles not only saved homes, it reduced insurance costs for residents of flood-prone suburbs where premiums were on the rise. ""Some of the clients we've been working with have actually received a premium reduction between 40 and 50 per cent based on flood resilience work,"" he said. ""Insurers are open to reducing premiums if their assets are protected."" Not everyone is eligible for financial assistance to flood-proof their homes, but Mr Davidson said understanding your flood risk and shelling out for a few essential upgrades could make a huge difference. Whether you have started the clean-up or are preparing for flooding, here is how to make an insurance claim. ""The first thing I would suggest is asking a surveyor to give you a spot level of your ground floor — that costs somewhere between $300 and $500,"" he said. ""Once you've got that level, approach council about understanding whether you're affected by overland flow, creek or riverine flooding."" Mr Davidson said knowing what types of flooding your home was vulnerable to would reveal how long it could be exposed to water during a flood and what building materials to avoid. ""Overland flow flooding might be in and out within six to eight hours versus riverine flooding, which can stick around for three to four days,"" he said. ""Creek flooding generally could be one to two days."" Sodden plasterboard and insulation piled up on front yards and footpaths was a familiar sight during Queensland's flood clean-up and became a magnet for mould. Mr Davidson said any cavity or gap between building materials, like the void between exterior cladding and an internal wall, were problematic following a flood. ""If you get water ingress in there then that's primed for mould growth and you can actually have long-term issues if you don't let things dry out enough,"" he said. Queensland's flood resilience guidance recommends constructing walls from core-filled blocks or single-skin polycarbonate to eliminate cavities that can hold moisture and silt. It also demonstrates how homes can be designed with spaces to lift important items higher when flooding starts, and styles of perimeter fencing to help floodwater flow away. Keeping up with home maintenance and re-thinking material choice for items like kitchen cabinets and door frames could also save home owners money in the long run, according to Mr Davidson. ""We've generally used hardwood timber frames, rather than pine, because hardwood is less susceptible to mould and to swelling during an event,"" he said. ""There are a lot of materials on the market now that are affordable for cabinetry, waterproof products that can be rained on.""

12,'My kids were getting heat stroke': Perth residents count the cost of living through record summer temperatures,house-and-home,"  Perth residents count the cost of record summer temperatures — and the price is too high for many For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Jessika Gill has spent much of the past three months with her two children in the one room of her house that has an air conditioner, just trying to keep cool. Perth experienced a record of 13 days with temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius this summer, six of which were consecutive. The city also experienced a record number of days above 35C. The single mother of two children, aged nine and 18 months, spent $700 to buy a portable air conditioner to try to cool her public housing home amid the rising heat. ""My kids were getting heat stroke and nosebleeds,"" she said. It's been a summer for the history books as Perth swelters through its hottest ever on record, with an average maximum temperature that's smashed the previous record by almost one degree. ""At night I'd get a wet towel and put it over me because my body heat was so bad that I couldn't sleep. ""The younger one gets very hot at night; I get really worried that she's going to overheat. A lot of the time it's three of us all sleeping in one room."" Ms Gill suspects that despite just cooling one room, her next electricity bill will be sky high and take months to pay off, but she felt she had no choice for her family's health. ""It's horrible. You don't want to drag your kids out to a shopping centre just so they can be cool. We just want to be comfortable at home,"" she said. ""There are days when me and my two kids will spend the whole day in my bedroom, just so we're in a cool room."" She would like to see the state government install more effective and efficient air conditioners in public housing. ""I think the government should not assume that low-income people can't afford air conditioning,"" she said. ""It's not like we don't budget our bills, and it's a basic human need — we just had the hottest summer."" While Ms Gill's situation is extreme, other Perth residents are looking at what they can do to manage their comfort and energy costs amid rising average temperatures. Georgina Roy moved into a home in the relatively new northern Perth suburb of Aveley last year, and after going through what ""seemed like the longest and hottest summer that we've had"", she is looking hard at what she can do to prepare for next summer. Her home has solar panels and battery storage, but a $900 electricity bill quickly dispelled any false sense of security around her power use. ""One of the things that I'm looking into at the moment is actually getting more solar panels installed,"" she said. ""We're probably only producing about a quarter of the power that we're using currently. ""I'm also looking at putting in some more doors within the house so that I can just cool the areas that I'm in, rather than cooling the entire house, which is not necessary."" But Ms Roy has also realised there is a limit to what she can do on her own, and that decisions made beyond her home have a big impact. ""We live in a suburban area, there are houses that don't have lots of trees, and a lot of houses around me have artificial turf,"" she said. ""It's just made it much clearer to me the impact that those decisions have on the suburb as a whole, in terms of how much heat it retains."" Petra Tschakert researches climate change adaptation and resilience at the University of Western Australia. She thinks there are simple things people can do on a everyday basis to adapt to rising temperatures. ""Things like cool showers, water bottles for spraying, misters, putting your feet into a bucket of cold water while working at home or before going to bed, putting on wet clothing or wrapping a wet cold sheet around us when we go to bed,"" Professor Tschakert said. ""I think we often forget these and think all we have is air conditioning, and I think that's a mistake."" But she said beyond that, state governments would need to do more to protect people from the impact of climate change, especially vulnerable groups and people who lacked the means to do their own home modifications. She suggested the state government investigate mapping areas of vulnerability across the metropolitan area, and look at options like the tree canopies in different suburbs. Socio-economic demographic data could be used to identify ""low-income groups, areas with high proportion of Indigenous people, locations with government housing"" to help target measures where they were needed most. ""Then emergency services and government organisations should focus on providing strategic neighbourhood cool refuges — swimming pools, libraries, services for the elderly, we do not have this,"" Professor Tschakert said. Professor Tschakert also would like to see state government subsidies to help pay for the cost of fitting houses to be more energy efficient and comfortable. ""It's a government's responsibility that retro-fitting occurs for roof and ceiling insulation, for cooler roofs and window blinds and water storage and emergency power,"" she said. ""Living conditions, for many people, are unbearable,"" she said, adding that she had heard of a man who spent nights in his car because it was the only way he could access air conditioning. ""If these are the solutions people have and they are desperate, then the state has failed the poor in adapting."" For people who can afford to modify their homes, the gains are enormous, allowing them to live not just in more comfort, but without the stress of the cost. When the pandemic derailed a big trip she was planning, Meghala Nair put the money into installing solar panels and battery storage. ""It was a huge monetary commitment of around $12,500, but one that I wish I had taken much earlier,"" she said. ""I've gone from bi-monthly electricity bills of $400 to $1,000-odd to much more reasonable bills — the lowest has been around $14. ""I rescue birds and dogs and live with my retired parents, so we keep the air con running for the animals and Dad and Mum throughout the year. ""Emotionally, it's a huge plus knowing that I've played my part in trying to be self-sufficient and environmentally friendly and I don't feel as guilty putting the air con on."" WA Council of Social Services (WACOSS) would like to see the benefits people like Ms Nair are able to afford, extended to people who rent or live in public housing. WA renters are pushing for landlords to provide minimum standards of comfort in properties, as Perth swelters through another heatwave. In addition to arguing for greater levels of Commonwealth income support and more affordable energy pricing for low-income households from the state government, WACOSS is lobbying for improvement to public housing. ""We've been asking of the Minister for Housing that they improve the ventilation and insulation. They've given a fantastic commitment to build 3,300 new social houses over the next four years,"" WACOSS chief executive Louise Giolitto said. ""There has to be a consideration for climate proofing of these houses, to make them energy efficient."" She said there was a strong relationship between heatwaves and presentations at hospital emergency departments, with children and old people the most at risk. ""[Heat makes it] really difficult to live a full and productive life. It impacts people's ability to sleep, and again that impacts their health and wellbeing. ""When you don't have energy efficient homes with appropriate cooling, it impacts every part of someone's life.""

13,Is your dream home taking longer than expected to build? Here's why,house-and-home,"  Home builders, renovators told to expect more delays, price rises For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Budding home owners across regional Victoria are facing further delays in the construction of their dream houses due to supply chain disruptions and worker shortages. Builders are waiting about nine months for trusses and up to 16 weeks for laminated veneer lumber (LVL), one of the most widely used engineered wood products, according to Master Builders Victoria (MBV). Stuart Allan, chair of MBV's country sector committee, said these shortages were likely to continue into next year. ""It's widespread, but if we're just talking trusses, they're used right throughout the industry,"" he said. ""We are talking with designers and engineers to try and get LVL beams as an alternative to pitch a roof with, but there is a demand for those beams as well and the supply of those beams comes from overseas. ""So now there is a shortage of those as well as; there is demand from a lot of countries [for the material]."" Graeme Pilcher, the managing director of Pilcher Builders in Bendigo, said costs had been steadily increasing over the past two years. ""I'd say it's probably somewhere between 20 and 25 per cent costs overall that have increased and it may even be more,"" he said. ""And it'll be interesting to see what the rise in the price of fuel will do; it's getting close to $2 a litre now, so that'll impact transport and everything like that as well."" Building costs have risen so much that one construction professional says he goes to work every day knowing he'll ""disappoint at least one person"". Due to the worker and supply shortages facing the industry, Mr Allan, who is a builder in Ballarat, said houses were taking 30 per cent longer to build. ""Everyone is having to wait, and it's not just the building industry. The wait on materials, and certainly the Ukraine situation has made things more uncertain because we import so many materials,"" he said. ""But the supply of labour is certainly an issue; we've had that problem for over 10 years."" This has occurred at a time of increased demand. MBV figures show that during the past three months of 2021, the number of loans to owner-occupiers for home renovations was 77.8 per cent higher than a year earlier, with the pace of growth even stronger for investors. COVID workplace restrictions on close contacts and positive cases also exacerbated the problem, Mr Allan said. ""Whether it is truck drivers delivering materials to site or the tiler can't come in, or your plasterer can't come in today … it's just dragging out the process. ""We're hoping clients can work with their builder and be sympathetic to the situation."" ABC Ballarat will deliver a wrap of the week's news, stories and photos every Wednesday.

15,Should bodies corporate be able to fine people for bad behaviour? And would it save lives?,house-and-home,"  Strata reform talks ask: Should bodies corporate be able to issue fines for bad behaviour? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A strata reform roundtable is discussing whether bodies corporate should have the power to issue fines to people breaching by-laws in buildings. If approved, fines could be issued to people misbehaving on balconies, smoking or parking in incorrect areas, having unapproved parties or being too loud. Misbehaviour at major events, including Schoolies on the Gold Coast, has played a role in the talks, as have incidents in recent years that have left several people injured and one person dead. Last week at Surfers Paradise, a man in his 20s fell three floors from the fifth-storey balcony of a backpackers' hostel, leaving him with critical injuries. Months earlier, a 16-year-old fell nine metres from the St Tropez Apartments at Surfers Paradise and was taken to hospital in a critical condition. In 2020, a Brisbane teenager died after falling four storeys from a Surfer's Paradise apartment balcony. The incidents are just several of countless that have occurred on the Gold Coast over the years. Misbehaviour at events such as Schoolies includes people risking their lives by balcony hopping and sitting on high-rise ledges. In response, some Queensland building managers have been barring access to balconies during large events. Strata Community Association (SCA) vice-president Chris Irons said the topic of bodies corporate being able to issue fines had come up before and was raised during talks on future reforms for the sector. ""The SCA Queensland is part of a roundtable with a lot of other stakeholder groups who are in regular discussions with government about how to improve corporate legislation and the issues that come up,"" Mr Irons said. ""It's common knowledge that there's a reform process going on and the issue of body corporates being able to issue fines has come up."" He said conversations about fines for misbehaviour were being held at a ""very conceptual level"". ""It comes up in connection with events like Schoolies … where there's a tendency for a lot of people to be on the balcony,"" he said. Mr Irons said the SCA wanted the government to seriously consider allowing fines for anyone caught breaching by-laws. ""This could be one instance — if you’ve got people staying in an apartment out on the balcony and behaving badly, climbing between floors, the next morning if body corporate handed them an on-the-spot fine of $200 or more, it's quite possible the next night that wouldn't happen again,"" he said. ""But at the moment there's zero ability for that to happen … and the government's been very, very reluctant to think about that. ""I get why, but perhaps this might be one case where it is warranted."" Mr Irons, the state government's former body corporate commissioner, said most building managers did not have the authority to ban people from balconies, but he understood why they were doing so anyway. ""They're going ahead and taking a really extreme step to safeguard things,"" he said. ""There's not a great deal you can do about human behaviour — as an owner or body corporate, you can't tell people what to do and regulate human behaviour. ""Even the most level-headed people staying at holiday locations will see the sign about a balcony and go, 'Yeah sure' — but it [just] takes a couple of glasses of wine and they lose a bit of self-awareness. ""The best people can do is try and protect things and hope people exercise responsibility."" Mr Irons encouraged building owners, managers and bodies corporate to be proactive and ""not wait for something terrible to happen"". ""Whether it's balconies or something else, if a body corporate is proactive, has a regular schedule of maintenance, regular inspection, that is always going to be the safest and most logical way of safeguarding themselves,"" he said.

16,'It looked like blood but it was actually honey': Perth couple confront surprise substance oozing from wall,house-and-home,"  Heatwave leads to historic hive meltdown inside Perth wall cavity For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency When Diana Gomes and her husband moved a couch recently, they were startled by a thick, dark liquid dripping down the wall. ""There was this liquid leaking from the wall from the top of the skirting board and going all the way to the timber floor and it just looked really strange,"" Ms Gomes told Nadia Mitsopoulos on ABC Radio Perth. ""It looked like blood,"" she said. ""We got closer to it and checked it out. We touched it and it was thick and sticky. ""It didn't feel like blood, and then I just thought the closest thing it looked like was honey."" Both Ms Gomes and her husband tasted a very small amount, and their suspicions were confirmed. ""It was sweet, and it was just honey, yeah,"" she said. While the couple had identified the substance, they were perplexed by the cause. ""We've got no bees in the house. I've never seen any bees around it."" The area where the honey was oozing from was a blocked-up fireplace. ""We bought the house four years ago. We know there was a chimney there, but the chimney was already closed when we bought it,"" Ms Gomes said. ""My husband went to the roof to check the top and the chimney was completely sealed, there were no bees around or anything."" The couple eventually decided it must have been an old hive that had been in the space for years. Perth experienced two heatwaves over Christmas and January, when temperatures reached over 40 degrees Celsius for up to six days running, which the couple suspect made the honey melt. Ms Gomes said they cleaned the wall and floor but were still left with the problem of the hive trapped in the cavity. ""I don't want to but I think we're going to have to [knock the wall down],"" she said. ""We contacted the home insurance and they don't cover it."" A few days later Ms Gomes confirmed that the couple had bitten the bullet and knocked into the wall, discovering a whopping 101kg lump of honey and hive in the old fireplace. ""Lucky there were no bees, it was just an old massive hive,"" she said. ""We removed it and cleaned everything ourselves and it was a very hard job, but I am extremely happy and relieved we sorted it out."" Honey can survive for centuries in the right conditions, and has even been found in archaeological excavations of Ancient Egyptian sites, thanks to its composition and chemical properties. It is most likely to be preserved in dry conditions as humidity can lead to fermentation.

17,'It felt pretty hopeless': Young home buyers despair of Northern Rivers' prices,house-and-home,"  Northern Rivers house prices double in five years locking out aspiring home owners For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency In the two years Sam Gaukroger has been house hunting in a once-affordable northern NSW town, she says there have only been two or three properties advertised below half-a-million dollars. It has been a daunting process for the 28-year-old Lismore youth worker who has watched the region's median house prices grow to eye-watering levels since the start of the pandemic. ""If I was looking at a house two years ago I would have been able to get it,"" Ms Gaukroger said. ""Since COVID … the housing market has just gone exponentially up."" The latest figures from Domain show seven out of the top ten regional areas in New South Wales for real estate price growth in the last quarter were in the Northern Rivers. In Lismore, prices have almost doubled in five years, from a median price of $340,000 in December 2016, to $612,500 in December last year. For many of the region's younger demographics – those in their 20s and 30s who perhaps grew up there or work locally – trying to buy a property can feel like running after a train you have just missed. Ms Gaukroger, who has lived in the Northern Rivers town for the past decade, said she wanted the security that came with home ownership without severing ties to her community, support networks and workplace by relocating to a different, and possibly cheaper, part of the country. ""I could go and buy a house [somewhere else] … but that's not where I want to be. ""I want to be here in Lismore and I really love the community of Lismore but they're just driving out the young people when you don't have housing. ""It's tough but it's probably just teaching me patience, to sit back and wait, because how long can is this going to be sustainable that housing is going to over $500,000."" The Central Coast, according to some, is quickly becoming part of Sydney's outer suburbs. But as skyrocketing house prices push Sydneysiders up north, who’s being priced out? Northern Rivers mortgage broker of 18 years Sana Hosseini said there was a lighter side to the property price boom. Mr Hosseini said older generations who had benefited from substantial growth in their property values had been able to help younger family members with deposits and by going guarantors on loans. ""That capital growth enables them to assist their children and the next generation in a lot of situations we're finding,"" Mr Hosseini said. Mr Hosseini said for those who did not have parents or grandparents who were able to assist, there were other options, such as the government's First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, which allows eligible first home buyers to purchase a property with a five per cent deposit and no lenders mortgage insurance. But he said the scheme was not without its faults, including the ""unintended consequence"" of driving up the lower end of property prices and limited allocations, which meant waiting lists of up to six months. ""A lot of people have found that really isn't an option for them to wait those periods,"" Mr Hosseini said. Mr Hosseini said another factor which could be contributing to Millennials feeling like they were locked out of the housing market, was a shift in expectations around first homes. ""If you look at the new homes that people live in – they're not the homes that our parents and previous generations have had,"" he said. Mr Hosseini suggests those seeking to buy their first home should view it as a stepping stone, rather than a forever home. He said while median house prices in the more lucrative coastal suburbs like Lennox Head and Byron Bay were well into the six figures, more affordable homes could still be found further inland in areas like Lismore, Casino and Kyogle.

Goonellabah resident Layla Sizer-Robertson, 26, said she was lucky to have been able to purchase a home with her partner through the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. But she said it was not easy. After five years of saving, the couple was finally ready to purchase a $300,000 property around Lismore, where they had always lived and worked, when the pandemic hit. Ms Sizer-Robertson said they initially missed out on the government's home loan deposit scheme and their mortgage approval was put on hold following changes to lending rules, which excluded her job in retail. She said the probation period on her partner's new job also meant that by the time they could secure a mortgage, the properties they had been looking at had jumped by more than $100,000. ""We continued saving but felt pretty hopeless and had basically given up,"" she said. They applied for the First Home Loan Deposit scheme again and were successful. After viewing more than 20 properties and making offers on five, they were finally able to secure a home in Goonellabah for their maximum borrowing amount of $600,000. ""[We're] happy to have a place, and we feel like we got a good deal for the current real estate climate,"" she said. ""However two years ago, our house would have been worth $200,000 less.""

Former body corporate chief says smoking ruling could have flow-on effects,house-and-home,"  Former body corporate commissioner says balcony pets, vaping, BBQs could also be deemed hazardous For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A former Queensland government body corporate commissioner says a recent ban on a unit owner smoking on her balcony could set a precedent for anything that could be deemed a health hazard including pet urine and barbecues to smoking or vaping at office buildings. Last month the Office of the Commissioner for Body Corporate and Community Management ordered a Surfers Paradise unit owner not to smoke tobacco products on her balcony after a complaint from her neighbour. The woman was ordered only to smoke elsewhere within her apartment if she took reasonable steps to ensure the smoke was not  affecting another person in the complex on the basis the smoke was a hazard. A Gold Coast unit owner has been banned from smoking on her balcony, a landmark decision that could impact all apartment dwellers, industry experts say. Now a senior vice president of the Strata Communication Association, Chris Irons said the decision had wide reaching potential and had been impossible to achieve from his former office. ""Up until this point it's been nigh on impossible to get this kind of ruling because you had to prove nuisance,"" he said. ""There was a legal precedent established for nuisance and it was so high it was virtually impossible to achieve, but that's now changed. ""Second-hand smoke was declared a hazard, and now that is the statement by which it is set. ""Not only that, the order goes on to say the phrase 'tobacco products', so we're looking at that also including vaping."" Mr Irons said the use of the term ""hazard"" could be argued for many other issues in shared areas, including use of barbecues or even having pets on balconies. ""I do think there's potential for it to widen,"" he said. ""A hazard effectively is something with the potential to cause harm, so as long as someone can prove it has the potential to cause harm and show that quite conclusively — they could win. ""Barbecue smoke, could someone argue that's a hazard? Well if someone had a document from the health department showing it was, maybe. ""Incense? Or another good example would be dog urine, faeces on a balcony. That quite possible could cause harm. ""So I don't think it's automatic, but the potential is definitely there."" Mr Irons said the ruling could impact any strata-owned buildings and spaces. ""It can be duplexes, high rises, you have commercial buildings for office spaces, some hotels, unit lots, commercial developments, shared sheds,"" he said. ""It now opens up an avenue for disputes in a whole range of buildings across Queensland where it was not happening before."" According to Mr Irons, while the ruling could set a new precedent, he said for it to be effective it would need to be enforced. ""This doesn't necessarily solve the problem. The mere fact that the order has been made doesn't stop the person smoking,"" he said. ""That order has to be enforced through the courts and that is a long, arduous, costly process. ""Each situation is also considered on its merits. Each owner, each building is different. ""It would still be up to the individual to follow through and make their case, take it all the way. It wouldn't be a blanket outcome. ""So the potential for the drain on public services when it comes to dispute resolution and the justice system can be pretty high at this outcome, I would have thought."" He said he was not surprised the topic had raised debate in the community overnight, but was not sure whether it was due to the ban on smoking or issues regarding the owner's rights. ""Which part [of the ruling] is bothering people, I'm not sure,"" he said. ""But I can certainly appreciate that people don't like being told what to do in their own home. It will impact tenants too."" We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

19,Unit dwellers could be barred from smoking on balconies after landmark decision,house-and-home,"  Queensland unit dwellers could be barred from smoking on balconies after landmark decision For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Queenslanders living in apartments could be prevented from smoking on their balconies after a ""game changing"" decision to ban one unit owner from doing so after a complaint from an upstairs neighbour. A unit owner at the Artique Resort in Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast complained that their downstairs neighbour, on the eighth floor, was a ""chain smoker"". The ninth-floor owner claimed the eighth-floor neighbour spends about five minutes smoking and could do so about every 20 to 40 minutes, labelling the smoke ""relentless and unbearable"", causing her to be concerned about her health. In response, the eighth-floor owner disputed she was a chain smoker, saying a packet could last her a week. She said she could not help where the wind blows, and also gets cigarette smoke, marijuana smoke, BBQ smoke, and strong perfume and cooking smells entering her own apartment. She also said she has a disability and ""going downstairs to smoke is out of the question"". The Office of the Commissioner for Body Corporate and Community Management's adjudicator ordered that the eighth-floor owner must no longer smoke tobacco products on the balcony. Furthermore, it was ruled she can only smoke elsewhere within her apartment if she takes reasonable steps to ensure the smoke does not affect any person in another apartment. The adjudicator made the decision in December last year on the basis that the smoking was causing a hazard to the other owner. Kristi Kinast, president of the Strata Community Association of Queensland, the peak voice for body corporates, said the decision by the adjudicator was a ""game changer"". Ms Kinast said she believed it ""absolutely"" set a precedent for other apartment dwellers. Good ventilation is more than just about preventing mould — it's becoming a way to deal with COVID-19. ""Up until now … the onus has been on complainants to prove that the volume and frequency of smoke is a nuisance, and that is almost impossible to prove,"" she told ABC Radio Brisbane. ""This changes things to say that any sort of smoke is a hazard, or any sort of volume and frequency is a hazard, so it will absolutely open the floodgates, we very much expect. ""I think if we look at this in a greater context, in terms of our society, we've seen these changes over the last decade or more where we've seen continued evolving of the restrictions on smokers — can't smoke in airports, restaurants, workplaces — but it hasn't reached, until now, into strata."" Ms Kinast said apartment dwellers could seek information on the process from the Office of the Commissioner for Body Corporate and Community Management, and people could seek mediation or adjudication on the issue. ""The other thing I'd suggest … is to push the government for some change,"" Ms Kinast said. ""Here we've seen an adjudicator make a decision that now impacts all of us, some will say positively, but the government has been sitting on this for years — almost a decade. ""We need the government to give some clarity and some clear direction to our bodies corporate and to the commissioner's office on how this can be treated moving forward."" Former commissioner of Queensland's Body Corporate and Community Management, Chris Irons, said the decision meant effectively anybody who can show cigarette smoke drifting from one balcony to theirs could show it is a hazard. ""This I would think potentially also applies to vaping as well,"" he said. Mr Irons said smoking has been a really ""tense, difficult issue"" in strata for years, with little that could be done about it. ""So this case has effectively thrown the gauntlet down for the government to do something about it,"" he said.

20,'Graciously imposing' 1829 coaching inn on the market for the first time,house-and-home,"  Oatlands property Kenmore Arms for sale for the first time since 1829 For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The township of Oatlands in southern Tasmania is well known for its immaculately preserved, colonial-era sandstone buildings. Now, history buffs and restoration project seekers alike have the chance to purchase one of the town's significant Georgian properties — Kenmore Arms. The property, situated on the Midland Highway, which joins Hobart and Launceston, includes a house, a shearing shed and a number of outhouses. It was built by Daniel O'Conner, a discharged soldier who received 100 acres of land on the stretch of road known as St Peters Pass as a military claim. He started building the home in the late 1820s and it was used as an inn from 1832. After Mr O'Conner's death, Kenmore Arms was absorbed into the adjoining estate of his business partner Askin Morrison and has been in the Morrison family ever since. Mr Morrison owned a number of other properties across Tasmania and his status as a landowner saw him elevated to political office in Tasmania's Legislative Council. The listing describes the two-storey, 503.7sqm residence as ""graciously imposing"". Real estate agent and heritage property expert Dominic Romeo said he expected it to fetch between $1.3 and $1.4 million. ""I think the price reflects its position. If it was away from the highway, I would say you could comfortably add half a million dollars to it."" He said he expected the house would need about half a million dollars worth of work. ""There’s probably $100,000 cost involved in repairing the walls and cracks and the structural work,"" he said. ""The rest of it is cosmetic … probably another $300,000 to $350,000."" The home is a textbook example of a coaching inn, which traditionally housed travellers commuting by horse and cart between Hobart and Launceston. Manager of Heritage Projects at the Southern Midlands Council Brad Williams said they were necessary back when the trip took three to five days. ""I guess a coaching inn with its stables is like a hotel and a car park these days,"" he said. He said Oatlands and surrounding towns are still home to a number of colonial buildings due to a slower rate of development compared to mainland cities. ""Tasmania in general has got an amazing array of these buildings that have survived and that's part of the charm, I guess,"" he said. ""The whole package of this heritage place, the building itself, the setting, the outbuildings, the walled garden and the large trees, it's very iconic. It's in remarkably good condition."" The property is listed on both the Tasmanian Heritage Register and the council's heritage list. Mr Williams said the council would work with the new owners to make sure they restored the property with the relevant rules in mind. Farmers Kate Morrison and her husband Askin Morrison, a descendant of the Askin Morrison four generations before them, are selling the property because the shearing shed attached to it no longer meets their requirements. They have subdivided the land so they can hold onto some of it for their farming operation and are selling off the portion that contains the house, a number of outhouses and the shearing shed. Ms Morrison said it was both exciting and sad the house would be leaving their hands. ""It's the long association with the one place that makes it special and the fact that it's such a recognisable place on the Midland Highway."" ""Each of the generations has their own memories,"" she said. ""For my father-in-law, who's passed away now, his memory of the shearing shed is this really strict hierarchy for the staff seating at mealtimes."" ""The wool classer and the property owner sat at the heads of the table and down the sides would be the various staff as they were deemed in the hierarchy. ""My husband's memory is just the vast quantity of food that the shearers would prepare for each meal, the swathes of food that came out."" For her boys, it's the birthday parties they'd have in the cookhouse. What she really loves about the buildings for sale is the ""layers of history"" in the walls. ""People who have been associated with the buildings have put their initials, or stencilled their initials, in the beams of the shearing shed,"" she said. Ms Morrison said it was the family's preference for the house to remain a residential property. ""The house is a beautiful house and it would make a beautiful home so I would love it if it did turn into someone's home,"" Ms Morrison said Mr Romeo said there was interest coming in from all over Australia and ""quite a lot"" just within the state. He received around 100 calls in the first 24 hours of its listing and said the fact the property wasn't on a huge amount of land presented a rare opportunity. ""This makes it more affordable for someone who's really more interested in the building and restoring something special on small acres, and that doesn't happen often in the Tasmanian market,"" he said.

21,'I hardly use light switches anymore': Meet the Australians automating their homes,house-and-home," Science The future of smart homes: how we might be living in 10 years' time For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency When his children have been watching TV for too long, an automated system notifies Chris and gives him the option of turning off the screen remotely or sending his kids a message. ""I'll send a message to say 'what you are you doing? You've been sitting around for too long,'"" Chris, who lives in Queensland with his family of four, says. When data gathered from local weather stations indicate that rain will strike the eastern side of the house in exactly five minutes, the system tells him what windows on that side are open. If he's not home and an intruder visits, a hidden smart speaker erupts with an aggressive barking noise. ""That's some of the cool stuff,"" Chris says. Technology that automates or remotely controls various household functions, from lighting to security, appears to be going mainstream, helped by a pandemic that has seen us spending more time at home, and more money on comforts like air fryers and smart speakers. But do these gizmos make life any better? Are ""smart homes"" the way of the future, or just the latest marketing gimmick? Chris's house is an extreme example, but locks, lights and doorbells that can be controlled through a phone and programmed to perform tasks automatically are becoming commonplace. According to some, these are the leading edge of a dramatic change in our homes' relationship with technology. This year's influential Consumer Electronics Show (CES) tech expo in Las Vegas saw a rush to capitalise on the trend: big brands launched a range of connected devices, from taps controlled by voice commands to video-streaming dog doors that open at a pet's approach. Other products included: The market research company Telsyte predicts the average Australian household will add more than 10 connected devices by 2025. If current demand is any guide, most of these new devices will be smart power outlets, speakers and light bulbs, as well as video doorbells, remote-activated locks, and surveillance cameras. But this is just the start, according to the smart home industry, which is pushing a new concept: ""contextual awareness"". This is where the home environment adapts to the desires and routines of its inhabitants: alarm clocks read the owner's schedule and set themselves accordingly, health sensors detect signs of illness and automatically order medicine, software dims lights and plays music according to a person's habits — or even their apparent mood. Some Australians, like Chris, are already experimenting with this idea. On the Facebook group ""Home Automation Australia"" (HAA), he and 9,000 other members share knowledge and trade jargon-heavy questions referencing obscure products and protocols. Surveillance cameras are getting cheaper, smaller and more accessible — and increasingly easy to hide. Created in 2017, HAA tripled its members over six months last year, according to one of the group's admins, Brent Wesley. Many members work in IT and most are men aged 25-54. ""Most people seem to be joining for much the same reasons: they are saving energy, improving securing, and adding convenience,"" Brent says. Pool pumps can automatically turn on during the middle of the day, when a rooftop solar array is producing excess energy. Security cameras can be trained to distinguish between a nosy dog and an intruder. Light switches can be activated by voice command. Blinds can rise with the Sun. TVs can spring to life when a person flops on a couch. ""A lot of people are driven towards it by curiosity,"" Brent says. ""When they realise what's possible, it becomes an all-consuming thing."" Another member of the group, Matthew, shared an 11-page list of his home's automations, including a ""goodnight routine"" that notifies ""if teeth aren't brushed"" and a video of a sunrise that increases in brightness on the bedroom television 30 minutes before the morning alarm. ""I have probably one of the most automated homes worldwide,"" says Matthew, who is a moderator of the r/homeautomation subreddit (with 1.4 million members). ""I could do more, like having the shower ready to go before I get up, or having my coffee maker turned on."" A fourth member, Elias, hooked up his lights to respond to voice commands issued to smart speakers peppered about the house. ""I say, 'Hey Google, turn on master bedroom lights', and it picks it up whether you're in the toilet or the corridor,"" he says. ""I hardly use light switches anymore."" If a house that's aware of your presence and can turn out the lights sounds either hellish or pointless, you're not alone. In 2020, Monash University researchers conducted interviews with households in Victoria and NSW to gauge their thoughts on these ""industry visions"" for how most people will live. Some were initially excited by the high-tech possibilities, but most ultimately decided this ""shiny future"" didn't fit with their life, according to Kari Dahlgren, a research fellow and one of the authors of a report on the findings. ""The research was trying to understand what flashy technologies people will accept into the home,"" she says. ""We found there's an initial attachment to these [industry visions] and then they saw this future didn't necessarily match with that life ... no-one wants robotic lawn mowers."" People preferred to retain manual control, even when it cost time or money. Many households disliked the idea of giving energy retailers the ability to remotely switch off customers' heating or cooling when power prices approached a daily peak, in order to reduce household energy costs. Early adopters have a different relationship with technology than ""everyday people"", which may explain why industry visions of a high-tech future are sometimes unpopular, Dr Dahlgren says. Dreams of the labour-saving ""smart home"" go back to the 1957 ""Monsanto House of the Future"" made entirely of plastic and featuring an ""ultrasonic dishwasher"" and a sink with adjustable height. ""People's everyday lives and priorities aren't being taken into account in the design and marketing of those technologies,"" Dr Dahlgren says. ""The rhetoric for a long time has been the smart home is just around the corner. Why hasn't it come? It's been around the corner for 50 years."" Today's automated homes may not be a sign of what's to come, but a short-lived folly, like a sink with adjustable height. Even some ""early adopters"" on the Facebook HAA group are sceptical of the claim our homes will be packed with connected devices. ""There are so many gimmicky products,"" Michael from Melbourne says. ""I've got a smart fridge and the only time I log into the app is when there's been a power outage and I'm not at home. ""I have a smart washing machine and it's only got one great feature, which is sending a push notification when the washing is done. The rest is useless."" Then there's the security issues. David, a HAA member who's automated his Brisbane home, says he worries about strangers having access to the data generated by his family. ""If the data leaks, does it give people the ability to predict when I won't be home?"" The video doorbell maker Ring, acquired by Amazon in 2018, has partnerships with at least 1,800 US police departments that can request camera footage from Ring doorbells. Its millions of doorbells amount to a private surveillance network that's subject to very little oversight. There are also questions around privacy within the family when members can use devices to effectively spy on one another. ""It's super creepy being able to watch things in the house when you're not there,"" David says. ""Is it right for me to see my family turn the air-conditioning on and ring them up and say, 'Why are you doing that?'"" Some say there's nothing wrong with this. Chris from Queensland argues that a bit of electronic surveillance of the family, such as remotely monitoring the amount of time his children watch TV, is convenient for working parents who can't always be there in person. ""It is and it isn't intrusive,"" Chris says. ""There is that oversensitive 'Big Brother watching' issue. Access to the system is limited to me and my wife. ""But convenience outweighs the surveillance side."" And is it worth the money? Chris estimates he's spent tens of thousands of dollars on his ""hodgepodge"" of automations. ""It's nice to have rather than something offering real value. If I didn't have it I could live without it, absolutely,"" he says. ""But we haven't really entered the realm of proper home automation yet."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

22,Some Australians are discarding standard building codes and going above and beyond to future proof their homes,house-and-home,"  Should you build your home stronger to withstand the possible impacts of climate change? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency As the footprint of climate change becomes clearer, the ability of homes to withstand the accelerating impacts of climate change and extreme weather is turning into a significant challenge. Some Australians are taking it upon themselves to go beyond the building code and standards to protect their home from uncommon, but not impossible, extreme weather events. Working as an engineer for the Tropical Cyclone Testing Station, Geoff Boughton has seen hundreds of homes wrecked and ravaged, with families left without anywhere to live. He most recently witnessed it in Kalbarri and Northampton, an area where houses were not built to withstand the continuous cyclonic wind gusts caused by Seroja. ""They have to start again, and I really don't want that to happen for myself or my family,” he said. When building his own home in Perth, well outside of the cyclone-rated region of WA, this was something he considered. Cyclones are uncommon near Perth, but they're not unheard of. ""When you think of a 1 in 500 year event, if a house lasts for 50 years that makes it a 1 in 10 chance it happening within the lifetime of my house,"" he said. “The other thing is, with climate change, we really don’t know what the climate is going to be in 50 years time."" From the outside, his house looks like a typical Perth home, but its structure is far stronger. It's able to withstand a weak cyclone blowing constant gusts of up to 160kph and is waterproofed for extreme thunderstorm events. And it didn't cost much. He said this was achieved through several features, including strengthening a series of structural elements on his roof to prevent it from lifting even if a window was broken. The windows are a slightly higher specification to keep water out better, and his roof edge is sealed to prevent water from coming in. All up, he said the additional features cost him about $4000 from a new build for his timber home. Meanwhile, 100 kilometres south in Waroona, nestled amongst an old forest so thick you can barely see the house, lives Kingsley Dixon. His house is considered to be in a bushfire-prone area. But having lived through bushfires, including the devastating Waroona-Yarloop blaze, he and his husband have gone well beyond basic code in their build. They have invested tens of thousand of dollars adding a reliable, long-term water supply, superficial sprinklers across the roofing system and fire-resilient landscaping around the house. ""I think we need to move beyond minimum compliance, and ensure what we produce imagines the worst-case fire,"" he said. ""What if we get the 1 in 1000 year fire, which we haven't experienced?"" Like Mr Boughton, climate change and the heightened risk of bushfires in his region has reinforced his decision. Both Mr Dixon and Mr Boughton are part of a growing cohort of people building what is know as 'resilience' into their homes. A resilient house is one that is able to be lived in with relatively little work after a big event. Building standards are constantly under review to include the changing climate, with their primary focus to protect public health, safety and general welfare. But University of WA Environmental Engineer Anas Ghadouani said they are often ""slow"" to incorporate changes, and don't always protect your home from extreme weather events. He said the codes juggle a fine balance of risk to impact. ""The regulator can only look at the minimum standard that will resolve in the minimum damage to a neighbourhood with that building code,"" he said. He said the current risk analysis provided by building codes often meant a house would not withstand 'freak storms', which are getting more likely with climate change. ""So the building codes are protecting you from a 1 in 100 year event,"" he said. ""But the problem is some of those events are occurring more frequently than they're statistically supposed to be."" Building extra strength into your home is being encouraged by government and industry. Following Tropical Cyclone Seroja, the WA Department of Fire and Emergency Services offered grants of up to $20,000 to build additional protection into their homes. Melissa Pexton, State Recovery Controller from TC Seroja, said it was about minimising future destruction. ""With an increase in those more devastating events, we really want to try build in resilience at every opportunity,"" she said. Earlier this year, the James Cook University, Suncorp Insurance, CSIRO and architecture firm Room 11 collaborated to build what they called the ""one house to save many"", a home resilient to fire, flood, storm and cyclone. The directors of Room 11 architects said the final design showed, with thoughtful planning, it could be achieved at a comparable cost to a standard architecturally designed home. ""Things like running the wire in the ceiling and down the walls, and keeping the power-points a meter off the floor costs exactly the same, but your wiring stays dry,"" associate director Kate Phillips said. The costs of building resilience into your home can vary significantly, as demonstrated by the costs of Mr Boughton's features compared with Mr Dixon's. But it's most affordable when building from scratch. Mr Ghadouni said it ultimately came down to personal choice and the need to weigh up the risk with the cost to build. ""Probably not enough people are acting on it in my view, but people are actually not sure what to do,"" he said. He said there was enough climate science on a regional level for the home-owner to be able to make a decision on their risks.

24,Why has my home been overrun by pantry moths and how do I get rid of them? An expert explains,house-and-home,"  Why has my home been overrun by pantry moths and how do I get rid of them? An expert explains For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Has your home recently been overrun by tiny grey moths, flapping erratically around your kitchen? Spotted some suspicious webs in a cereal box? You might be sharing your dried food with pantry moths (Plodia interpunctella). Although several species of moth can live and breed in our homes, the pantry moth (also known as the ""Indian meal moth"") is one of the most common unwanted moth-guests. Pantry moths are found on every continent except Antarctica. They feed on rice, grains, flour, pasta, cereals, dried fruits, spices, seeds, nuts and other dried food. Their fondness for dried foods makes them a major pest in food storage facilities. So how did they get in your house — and what can you do to get rid of them? Like other moths, pantry moths have four distinct life stages: egg, caterpillar, pupae and adult. The first sign of a pantry moth infestation is often the sight of adult moths flying in an erratic, zig-zag path around our kitchens. Next time you spot a maggot, reconsider the urge to say ""yuck"" — these little, legless creatures are here to help us if only we let them. Pantry moth adults have grey-coloured wings with bronze or tan bands near the wing tips. Although they can be annoying, adult moths do not feed at all. The trouble arises when female moths lay their eggs in or around our food. The tiny eggs hatch into barely visible cream-coloured caterpillars small enough to crawl into poorly sealed food containers. There, they begin to feed. As they grow, caterpillars produce large amounts of silk webbing and faeces, both of which can contaminate food. Once a caterpillar reaches its full size, it leaves the food in search of a safe space to make a cocoon, usually a crack, container lid, crevice or corner. Sometimes they turn up in the hinges of a pantry door. A few weeks later, an adult moth emerges from the cocoon, ready to start the cycle again. Unfortunately, it's likely you brought them home yourself. Although pantry moths can enter via doors and windows, most infestations probably start when we inadvertently bring home eggs and caterpillars in our dried foods. Kitchens full of unsealed containers and spilled food create an irresistible smorgasbord for female moths looking for the ideal place to lay eggs. Like many insects, pantry moths develop more quickly at warmer temperatures. At warmer temperatures, females also lay more eggs and caterpillars are more likely to survive to adulthood. But prolonged exposure to temperatures above 40℃ are lethal to eggs and caterpillars. While pantry moths can be found at any time of the year, the warm temperatures of late spring and early summer are often perfect for supporting rapid population growth. First, eliminate their sources of food. Dry goods should be stored in sealed, airtight containers with tight-fitting lids. To prevent eggs and caterpillars from hitchhiking in on purchases, place dried foods in the freezer for three to four days; this should kill any eggs and caterpillars that may be present. If you already have an infestation, carefully inspect all potential food sources including spices, cereals, grains, dry pet foods, pasta, seeds, nuts, tea, dried flowers and dried fruit. Pantry moth caterpillars are hard to see; look for the silken webbing they produce, which can cause food grains to clump together. These webbed clumps are often more conspicuous than the caterpillars themselves. Infested foods should either be discarded or placed in the freezer for three to four days to kill eggs and caterpillars. Clean up and discard any spilled foods on shelves, under toasters or behind storage containers. Even small amounts of food can support thriving caterpillar populations. Caterpillars can travel considerable distances to find a safe place to make a cocoon, so make sure to check shelves, walls, crevices and ceilings. Moth cocoons can be removed by wiping with a damp cloth or with a vacuum cleaner. Cleaning and proper food storage are the best ways to end a pantry moth outbreak. Sticky pantry moth traps are commercially available and can be used to monitor and reduce the moth population. Pantry moth traps — triangular cardboard covered with a thick sticky glue — are baited with a chemical that mimics the smell of a female pantry moth. Males are attracted to the trap and become hopelessly stuck to the glue. Since sticky traps only target males, traps are unlikely to stop an outbreak on their own; always use them with proper food storage and careful cleaning. Insecticide sprays are unlikely to be effective as pantry moth caterpillars and eggs are protected within food containers. Pantry moths are also resistant to a range of insecticides, rendering them ineffective. Insecticides should never be applied on or near food. While it can be disconcerting to find tiny caterpillars in the cereal you've been enjoying all week, accidentally eating pantry moth caterpillars is unlikely to cause any health problems. Given how common they are in stored food, you've probably already unknowingly consumed many moth eggs and larvae. Thank goodness caterpillars are generally an excellent source of protein!
