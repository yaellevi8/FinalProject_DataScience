0,The first snapshot of the cosmic monster in our galaxy opens up more questions than it answers,science," Science We've seen the black hole called Sagittarius A* at the middle of the Milky Way. Now what? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency There's a monster twirling around in the centre of our galaxy, and its portrait has finally been unveiled. Overnight, the international Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) crew revealed an image of superheated gas coursing around and falling into Sagittarius A* or Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the Milky Way's core. It's the culmination of five years of simulations and data crunching. And while it might look a bit like a glazed donut, there's more to the new image than meets the eye. For one, it tells us the black hole is 4 million times the mass of the Sun — a figure physicists suspected, but is now confirmed. The black hole's spinning too, but it’s skew-whiff — slightly tilted face-on to us. But despite this veritable goldmine of information about our galaxy's black hole, there's still plenty we're yet to discover. Well, for one, it's our supermassive black hole. ""It's home,"" said Jessica Dempsey, an Australian astrophysicist and member of the EHT team. We've now had a look at the supermassive black hole in the middle of the Milky Way. But how did we know it was there at all? ""That's why this one is special to a lot of people. The hunt to understand what is going on at the centre of our galaxy is hundreds of years old."" And while it may not be the biggest black hole, Sgr A*'s proximity means it's our best bet for understanding how it and its counterparts behave. ""As our instruments on the ground and in space improve our understanding, the Milky Way black hole is going to go a long way to unpacking general relativity, and how that works with quantum mechanics,"" said Dr Dempsey, former deputy director of the East-Asia Observatory in Hawaii. Understanding more about the Milky Way’s hefty heart can give clues as to how our galaxy formed. ""And maybe what we can learn from Sgr A* we can start to look for … in other galaxies,"" she said. One of the biggest ongoing questions in black hole physics is exactly how they collect, ingest and expel material orbiting them at near light speed in a process known as ""accretion"". After much hype and fanfare, we now know what the mega black hole in the centre of our galaxy looks like. This process is fundamental to the formation and growth of planets, stars and black holes of all sizes, throughout the universe. Despite the brightly spiralling gas and dust in the image, Sgr A* was not ""eating"" as much matter as the team had expected. ""If Sgr A* was a person, it would consume the equivalent of eating a grain of rice once every million years,"" said Michael Johnson, an astrophysicist at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. While some black holes can be remarkably efficient in converting gravitational energy into light, Sgr A* traps and hangs onto nearly all of this energy. ""It converts only one part in 1,000 into light,"" Dr Johnson said. And unlike the gargantuan black hole in the galaxy M87, an image of which was released in 2019, Sgr A* is not blasting an enormous jet of X-ray energy into space. But it might have a weak jet, Dr Dempsey said, based on as-yet unexplained peculiarities in how it rotates and accretes matter. If a jet is indeed there, the EHT can't yet see it, but research published late last year suggests a weak jet might be present. While the EHT was gazing at the black hole, three X-ray telescopes kept an eye on it too. They spotted X-ray flares — or outbursts — from Sgr A*. Signs of a jet? Perhaps. James Miller-Jones, an astrophysicist at Curtin University and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, said measuring the polarised light thrown off by the black hole's surroundings would tell us about its magnetic field. It's something the EHT team reported, last year, about M87. ""Sgr A* seems to have a strong, dynamically significant magnetic field, which means it's a magnetic field strong enough to affect the motion of the plasma around the black hole,"" Professor Miller-Jones said. ""It's going to be very interesting to look at that magnetic field structure and how that's influenced by the black hole, particularly given that it's spinning."" Alister Graham, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University of Technology, hoped to find out just how fast Sgr A*'s spin was. ""Black holes can spin at significant fractions of the speed of light, but I sensed [the EHT team] was unable to get an accurate read on this."" Another mystery that's yet to be solved is pinpointing the launch site of plasma jets that blew up the colossal twin bubbles in the Milky Way, he added. So how will we answer these questions? First, let's look at how astrophysicists managed to peek through a cosmic curtain of stars and gas to the black hole within our galaxy. Over a handful of nights in April 2017, when skies were clear, eight observatories from Antarctica to Europe simultaneously focused their gaze onto the centre of our galaxy, each tuned to record light with a wavelength of 1.3 millimetres. These are radio waves — invisible to our eyes, but spat out in abundance by the incredibly hot, turbulent gas swirling around and falling into the black hole, which produces the donut-like image. Because the EHT observatories were separated by vast distances, each telescope received the same radio signals from the Milky Way's centre at slightly different times. Each radio signal data point was ""stamped"" at its telescope by an atomic clock so precise that over the course of 100 million years, it would lose only a second. When it was time to combine the data, these time stamps let physicists synchronise the slew of signals and generate a sharper image. This linked-telescope technique, called Very Long Baseline Interferometry, essentially produces a telescope the size of the planet — and one with a resolution so high, it could, in theory, spot a ping pong ball on the surface of the Moon. So how can it be improved? Funny you should ask … The EHT has been training its radio-ready eyes on Sgr A* again — and on yet more objects — in the years since its first observations in 2017. More observatories have joined the EHT network since, which is already making a ""really huge"" difference, Dr Dempsey said. More ""eyes"" means the EHT can collect more light, increasing its sensitivity and its ability to spot fainter features. ""The more elements we bring in, the more sensitive we become, and the more certain we can be of fitting what we see … to the model,"" Dr Dempsey said. ""And the most critical part for Sgr A* is we can do those snapshots faster."" This means the team will eventually be able to take images on timescales they need to produce a movie that captures dynamic features such as the rotation of the black hole, and the gases tumbling around it. ""We really need to make a movie of our black hole to start to understand a lot of the questions [we still have],"" Dr Dempsey said. Already, the EHT has a spatial resolution some 5,000 times better than the Hubble Space Telescope, giving the EHT a ""whopping improvement"" in the ability to spy objects at vast distances, Professor Graham said. But to make out finer details, we'll need more telescopes. Not on Earth, though. ""Having a radio telescope in space will offer further gains in resolution, as will having one on the Moon,"" Professor Graham said. That's because the further apart the network's telescopes are, the better their spatial resolution is. Plans are afoot to send a 10-metre-wide radio telescope dish some 1.5 million kilometres into space, where the gravitational tug of Earth and the Sun will hold it in place. When incorporated into the Earth-based network, the telescope — called the Millimetron Space Observatory — should give the EHT a 150-fold improvement in resolution. The mission is led by the Russian Academy of Sciences, and is, so far, slated for launch in 2030. Tuning the EHT's radio dishes to pick up light of different wavelengths will give astrophysicists different representations of the black hole too. Detecting shorter wavelengths — less than a millimetre — should provide a sharper view through our galaxy's disc, Professor Miller-Jones said. Comparing the brightness of the black hole's gassy ring at different wavelengths — say, if it appears brighter in one wavelength than the other — could reveal some of its physical processes.

""With the next generation [EHT] facility, it will be very exciting to test our models of the environment around the black hole, and what we understand about the processes of how gas flows around it,"" Professor Miller-Jones said. ""All of that will be very, very interesting in the years to come."" So there will be, no doubt, plenty more never-before-seen insights into some of the most mysterious phenomena in the universe — including our galaxy's black hole. ""I personally love results that open up more questions than answers — and this [new image] is definitely one of those,"" Dr Dempsey said. Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

1,"'Holy cow, plants can grow in lunar soil': Scientists reveal hope for life on the Moon",science,"  Plants grow in lunar soil for the first time, as NASA plans for life on the Moon For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Scientists have used lunar soil collected during Apollo missions to grow plants for the first time. The results have been deemed promising enough that NASA is envisioning hothouses on the Moon for the next generation of lunar explorers. Researchers from the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences last year planted thale cress in soil collected by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and other astronauts. All the seeds sprouted but the plants ended up stunted, scientists revealed in results published on Thursday. The team of experts said they were initially dubious but are now planning to repeat the experiment with greater success. ""For their first week or so of life, there was really no difference between the controls and the lunar plant, so there wasn't something inherently toxic to the plants in lunar regolith [soil] that would prevent plants from growing,"" said University of Florida biologist and geneticist Anna-Lisa Paul. ""So everything else downstream is how can we mitigate any negative responses. That was the start and the positive spin on all of this."" The research could have implications for NASA astronauts heading to the Moon in coming years. ""That was the first step in what's going to hopefully be a very long, multi-decade process of figuring this stuff out and when we get back to the Moon, doing it on the lunar surface,"" University of Florida geologist Stephen Elardo said. His University of Florida colleague Robert Ferl said the team's first thought was: ""Holy cow, plants can grow in lunar soil."" ""We expect this to open up the scientific window on this topic dramatically,"" he said.

2,Our black hole might be a monster — but it's dwarfed by M87,science," Science Black hole images: First look at Sagittarius A* at heart of Milky Way revealed by Event Horizon Telescope For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Scientists have captured the first image of the monster black hole lurking at the heart of our galaxy. The black hole, known as Sagittarius A* or Sgr A*, lies 27,000 light-years from the Sun. All our previous knowledge about the supermassive black hole were based on indirect measurements of stars looping around the galactic centre, snared in its gravitational grip. ""Until now we didn't have the direct picture confirming Sgr A* was indeed a black hole,"" said Professor Feryal Özel of the University of Arizona. ""This is the first picture of the gentle giant at the centre of our galaxy."" The historic results were presented overnight in six papers published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Getting an image of our cosmic monster was ""not an easy journey"", Professor Özel said. ""It was extra challenging because … Sgr A* burbled and gurgled as we looked at it."" But the image confirms predictions that have been made by decades of work and proves yet again that Einstein's theory of general relativity was right. ""Because the size of a black hole shadow is proportional to its mass, our image tells us that the mass of Sgr A* is 4 million times greater than that of our Sun,"" said Sara Issaoun, an astrophysicist at Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and Radboud University in the Netherlands. ""It is really incredible that this prediction from Einstein's theory of general relativity matches the mass measured by the Nobel Prize-winning studies of stellar orbits in our galactic centre."" But that's not to say there weren't some surprises. The first snapshots of Sgr A* were captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a planetary wide network of telescopes stretching from Antarctica to Europe. Capturing images of black holes is extremely challenging because the gravitational pull at the centre of a black hole is so strong that not even light can escape. But the EHT can see the light beamed out by super-hot gas swirling around the edge of the black hole's disc. In 2019, the EHT released the first-ever images of the swirling mass of superheated dust and gas surrounding a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy 53 million light-years away called M87. But the two black holes are very different. At around 4 million times the mass of our Sun, Sgr A* is much smaller than M87, which weighs in at around 6.5 billion times the mass of our Sun. And it is much more dynamic than M87, changing on the scale of hours, rather than months. That makes it very challenging to take an image of, said Katie Bouman of Caltech. ""Its appearance can change from minute to minute."" But the power of the telescope and the team's careful analysis meant the image was incredibly precise — even though it looks like a bit of a fuzzy smudge. ""It looks blurry on the screen because you're only seeing a few pixels — but it's actually one of the sharpest images you've ever seen."" The image shows a face-on view of a cosmic monster, said Michael Johnson, an astrophysicist at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. ""Even though we are peering through the galaxy, it's actually tilted towards us,"" Dr Johnson said. We've now had a look at the supermassive black hole in the middle of the Milky Way. But how did we know it was there at all? To figure this out, scientists ran copious computer simulations of what Sgr A* should look like depending on different spin inclinations, then compared them to the real deal. ""I'm impressed by the multitude of simulations to find the correct description of our galaxy's black hole,"" said Alister Graham, an astrophysicist at Swinburne University of Technology. It might seem strange that a supermassive black hole would rotate in a different plane to its galaxy, but it makes sense when you think about how black holes feed, said James Miller-Jones, an astrophysicist at Curtin University and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research. The middle of the Milky Way is dominated by a huge bulge of stars surrounding the black hole. And if a star strays too close to Sgr A* and gets ripped apart and dragged in, or some of the gas blown off by those stars falls in, that matter transfers some angular momentum to the black hole. ""If you have an ice skater, and they're twirling around slowly, and someone throws them a metal object and they catch it, that will give them some extra momentum in that direction,"" Professor Miller-Jones said. ""It's the same with gas — as it falls into the black hole, it gets it to spin a little bit faster in that direction. ""And because this [gas] is coming in from all directions, the black hole's spin is gradually changed by small amounts."" Black holes also grow by merging with other black holes, which can happen when galaxies collide. Such mergers would result in a black hole with a spin that combined the spins of the two initial black holes, Professor Miller-Jones added. While the images confirm many predictions, there were also some surprises. Despite the brightly spiralling gas and dust in the image, Sgr A* was not actually ""eating"" as much matter as the team had expected, Professor Özel said. ""It turned out to be a gentler, more cooperative black hole than we'd hoped for during our decade of simulating its environment,"" she said. Sgr A* traps only a few times the energy of our Sun, Dr Johnson said. ""Sgr A* is the view of a standard black hole. It's quiet. Sgr A* is exciting because it is common."" Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. The images don't match the simulations previously done by the team, said Jess Dempsey, an Australian astrophysicist who is part of the EHT team. ""The simulations that our amazing teams have done predict more variability than what we see in the data,"" said Dr Dempsey, former director of the East Asia Observatory in Hawaii, one of the telescopes in the EHT. ""We had a very good match with M87, we don't see that here. So something else is going on. ""We are starting to see suggestions in the rotation and how it eats and accretes its mass into itself that we don't understand yet,"" added Dr Dempsey, who is now the director of ASTRON in the Netherlands. She said the work was just the beginning of our understanding of what is going on with the black hole lurking in the middle of our galaxy ""This is our first, really quick snapshot of something deep and complex,"" she said.

3," A 'fig leaf' for fossil fuels:  Coalition's 'clean' hydrogen plans nothing but greenwashing, critics say ",science,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Plans by the federal government to develop a ""clean"" hydrogen industry in Australia have been branded greenwashing by critics who say taxpayer money is being used to subsidise fossil fuel activities. The government has announced plans for a series of hydrogen hubs around the country as part of efforts to kickstart production of the fuel and decarbonise the economy. About $500 million has been earmarked for hydrogen hubs for industrial centres in places including Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and Tasmania. But the spending has drawn fire amid claims much of the money would be invested in so-called blue hydrogen, which is made using natural gas rather than renewable energy. The Australia Institute, a left-leaning think-tank, argued the funding defeated the purpose of building a hydrogen industry. The institute's climate and energy program director, Richie Merzian, said clean hydrogen could ""be one of two things"". ""You can make it using renewable energy, which is a zero-emissions process,"" Mr Merzian said. ""Or you can make it using fossil fuels, which is a really dirty process."" Climate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley backed the concept behind hydrogen hubs, which were aimed at putting producers of the fuel alongside big users such as industrial customers. But Mr Buckley described as greenwashing the government's support for blue hydrogen, which he said was a ""fig leaf"" to hide the continuation of the natural gas industry. The former investment banker said producing hydrogen from gas instead of renewable energy made no sense. It's been identified as the clean energy source that could help bring the world to net-zero emissions, but green hydrogen's future is not yet assured. ""At the end of the day, if you are going to make hydrogen from fossil fuels, you might as well just use the fossil fuels,"" Mr Buckley said. ""Why go through the extra processing steps, the extra cost, to use hydrogen? ""You might as well just use the gas, the coal, the electricity in the first place."" As well as providing financial support for blue hydrogen, the Coalition has also thrown its weight behind carbon capture and storage projects around the country. Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the technology would be vital if Australia — and the world more broadly — were to become carbon neutral in the coming decades. Mr Taylor said carban capture and storage had the backing of the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, noting there were ""just under 30 projects in production"" worldwide. He also defended the government's support of blue hydrogen prospects, insisting the process could help reduce Australia’s emissions. ""You've got to remember the objective of the exercise here is to reduce emissions, not destroy industries,"" Mr Taylor said. ""Now it is true there are activists out there that would like to destroy our traditional industries, whether it's agriculture, resources. ""They want to see the end of those industries. We don't."" Mr Buckley said the fact that blue hydrogen relied on burying carbon emissions underground should be a red flag for government. He claimed the technology had failed despite decades of trying by industry, and pointed to the problems that had plagued the carbon capture storage project at the $US54 billion Gorgon gas project off WA's north-west coast. Mr Buckley said it made no sense to be talking about blue hydrogen given commercial-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage had not actually worked. ""The government and the fossil fuel industry has been so effective at undermining the key enabler of carbon capture and storage, which is a carbon price,"" Mr Buckley said. ""In the absence of a carbon price, the whole idea of blue hydrogen is to put a fig leaf on the whole idea that methane gas has somehow got a path to decarbonisation."" Part of Australia's net zero by 2050 plan is to use carbon capture and storage to help get emissions down. But is it a realistic option? Mr Merzian agreed and also took aim at government assistance for a number of carbon capture and utilisation — otherwise known as enhanced oil recovery — projects in which carbon is pumped into reservoirs to extract more oil and gas. He said such support, along with money for blue hydrogen and carbon capture storage, amounted to the subsidisation of the oil and gas industry by taxpayers. At the same time, he said, oil and gas producers around the world were posting multi-billion-dollar profits as energy prices soared to all-time highs. ""Going down the pathway of fossil-fuel-based hydrogen is really dangerous because it's unlikely you're going to bury those emissions and you might just end up with more,"" Mr Merzian said. ""Carbon capture and storage has been a colossal failure."" He said its only benefit was in ""pretending we can continue to use fossil fuels in the hope that somehow we will be able to bury the problem"". ""It makes it all the more ridiculous when you have an actual opportunity to invest in a zero-emissions production process for hydrogen and it's available right now,"" he said. Mr Taylor dismissed the criticisms and said the government wanted to keep its options open as the country moved towards net zero by 2050. He said ""every technology that's available should be in the mix"" and highlighted how the government was spending $22 billion on different solutions to cut Australia's carbon output. Climate change is being buried this election. So we asked some of Australia's leading climate scientists for their verdict on how the major parties' policies stack up. ""There are some who would like the portfolio to be a minimal set of technologies and in the process destroy traditional industries,"" Mr Taylor said. He said the government was focused on having the broadest range of technologies available. ""This is a difficult job. It's made more difficult if you exclude technologies that have real potential,"" Mr Taylor said. ""Our focus is on the projects, not the companies."" Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association deputy chief executive Damian Dwyer said the industry was committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050 and noted it had already spent $5 billion on decarbonisation initiatives. Mr Dwyer said technologies such as carbon capture and storage would be ""critically important"" in helping Australia meet its goals. He said Australia was particularly well-placed to use carbon capture storage, suggesting the country had ""known high-quality, stable geological storage basins, existing infrastructure, world-class technical expertise and regulatory regimes"". ""In a similar way, natural gas is a pathway to a large-scale and innovative commercial hydrogen industry,"" Mr Dwyer said. ""An Australian hydrogen industry and a local market could generate significant opportunities for the country."" He said Australia's upstream oil and gas industry was well placed to assist in the development of a large-scale and innovative commercial hydrogen industry.

4,One in three people are infected with this parasite – and the clue could be in your eyes,science,"  One in three people are infected with Toxoplasma parasite – and the clue could be in our eyes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Toxoplasma gondii is probably the most successful parasite in the world today. This microscopic creature is capable of infecting any mammal or bird, and people across all continents are infected. Once infected, a person carries Toxoplasma for life. So far, we don't have a drug that can eradicate the parasite from the body. And there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. Across the world, it's estimated 30–50 per cent of people are infected with Toxoplasma — and infections may be increasing in Australia. A survey of studies conducted at blood banks and pregnancy clinics across the country in the 1970s put the infection rate at 30 per cent. However, a recent Western Australian community-based study found 66 per cent of people were infected. The disease caused by this parasite can scar the back of the eye. Our new research looked for signs of disease in otherwise healthy people and found a significant number bore the mark of Toxoplasma. The cat is the primary host for Toxoplasma. Cats catch the parasite when they eat infected prey. Then, for a couple of weeks, they pass large numbers of parasites in their faeces in a form that can survive for long periods in the environment, even during extreme weather. When the faeces are ingested by livestock while grazing, parasites lodge in the muscle and survive there after the animals are slaughtered for meat. Humans can become infected by eating this meat, or by eating fresh produce or drinking water soiled by cats. It is also possible for a woman infected for the first time during pregnancy to pass the infection to her unborn child. While infection with Toxoplasma is extremely common, the most important health statistic is the rate of the disease caused by the infection, which is called toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma really likes the retina, the multi-layered nerve tissue that lines the eye and generates vision. Infection can cause recurring attacks of retinal inflammation and permanent retinal scarring. This is known as ocular toxoplasmosis. Contrary to much that is written about ocular toxoplasmosis, medical research shows this condition usually affects healthy adults. However, in aged persons or people with a weakened immune system, or when contracted during pregnancy, it can be more severe. An attack of active inflammation causes ""floaters"" and blurred vision. When the inflammation progresses to scarring, there may be permanent loss of vision. In a study of patients with ocular toxoplasmosis seen at a large ophthalmology clinic, we measured reduced vision to below driving level in more than 50 per cent of eyes, and 25 per cent of eyes were irreversibly blind. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are quite familiar with managing ocular toxoplasmosis. But the extent of the problem is not widely recognised, even by the medical community. The number of Australians with ocular toxoplasmosis had never been measured, until now. We wanted to investigate the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in Australia, but we knew it would be challenging to get funding for a major survey of this neglected disease. So, we used information collected for a different purpose: as part of the Busselton Healthy Ageing Study, retinal photographs were taken from more than 5,000 baby boomers (born 1946–64) living in Busselton, Western Australia. The photographs were gathered to look for other eye diseases, macular degeneration and glaucoma. By screening these retinal photographs, we estimated the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis at one in 150 Australians. This might seem surprisingly common, but it fits with the way people catch Toxoplasma. In addition to pet cats, Australia has huge populations of feral cats. And Australia is home to a lot of farmland, including over 50 per cent of the global organic farming area. Most importantly, many Australians like to eat their red meat rare, putting them at real risk. To diagnose ocular toxoplasmosis, a retina examination is necessary, ideally with the pupils dilated. The retinal lesion is easy to spot, because of the way Toxoplasma activates retinal cells to produce certain proteins, and an ophthalmologist or optometrist can immediately recognise the appearance. Often a blood test is also performed to make the diagnosis. If the condition is mild, the doctor may let the body's own immune system control the problem, which takes a few months. However, usually a combination of anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic drugs is prescribed. Toxoplasma infection is not curable, but it can be prevented. Meat sold in Australian supermarkets may harbour Toxoplasma. Cooking meat to an internal temperature of 66C or freezing it ahead of cooking are ways to kill the parasite. Fresh fruit and vegetables should be washed before eating, and drinking untreated water (such as straight from rivers or creeks) should be avoided. Gloves should be worn when changing cat litter, and hands washed afterwards. The World Health Organisation and other international and national health bodies are promoting an approach called One Health for diseases that cross humans, animals and their environments. This involves different sectors working together to promote good health. Now we know just how common ocular toxoplasmosis is in Australia, there is real justification to harness One Health to combat Toxoplasma infections in this country. Justine R.

5,"University of Queensland confirms plans to leave Dayboro vet clinic, seeks new operator",science,"  University of Queensland to leave Dayboro vet clinic, seeks new operator For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The University of Queensland has confirmed plans to shift all veterinary teaching to Gatton, closing its long-running specialist veterinary training clinic at Dayboro. The university announced plans to close the 34-year-old Dayboro vet clinic, north of Brisbane, late last year. The move sparked concerns from regional cattle farmers that they would be left without accredited cattle vets close by, with the only other clinic about an hour and a half drive from Dayboro. UQ agreed to postpone the original closure slated for March and enter into a longer consultation period with local farmers, students and the industry. On Thursday, UQ School of Veterinary Science head Professor Nigel Perkins said in a statement that the university had made the ""difficult decision to seek a new operator for the Dayboro Veterinary Clinic to ensure it can continue to serve the local community"". ""We will be identifying a new operator through an expression of interest process, which is expected to take until the end of September,"" Professor Perkins said. National Tertiary Education Union UQ branch president Andrew Bonnell said the closure would see nine continuing staff made redundant and six casual positions discontinued. In 2012, UQ closed its small animal clinic at St Lucia and in 2013, invested $2.4 million in upgrading its Dayboro facilities. A petition was launched protesting the proposed closure late last year, garnering thousands of signatures, triggering a town hall meeting with UQ representatives and the Dayboro community. Professor Perkins said veterinary science and veterinary technology teaching will move from Dayboro to Gatton, west of Brisbane. ""The decision has not been made lightly and the University is genuinely committed to supporting staff, students and our valued customers through this process,"" Professor Perkins said. The university will cease operations at Dayboro on June 30, but with the expression of interest process continuing into September for a new clinic operator, UQ said it would ""continue to support the clinic operating"".

The move sparked concerns from regional cattle farmers that they would be left without accredited cattle vets close by, with the only other clinic about an hour and a half drive from Dayboro. UQ agreed to postpone the original closure slated for March and enter into a longer consultation period with local farmers, students and the industry. On Thursday, UQ School of Veterinary Science head Professor Nigel Perkins said in a statement that the university had made the ""difficult decision to seek a new operator for the Dayboro Veterinary Clinic to ensure it can continue to serve the local community"". ""We will be identifying a new operator through an expression of interest process, which is expected to take until the end of September,"" Professor Perkins said. National Tertiary Education Union UQ branch president Andrew Bonnell said the closure would see nine continuing staff made redundant and six casual positions discontinued. In 2012, UQ closed its small animal clinic at St Lucia and in 2013, invested $2.4 million in upgrading its Dayboro facilities. A petition was launched protesting the proposed closure late last year, garnering thousands of signatures, triggering a town hall meeting with UQ representatives and the Dayboro community. Professor Perkins said veterinary science and veterinary technology teaching will move from Dayboro to Gatton, west of Brisbane. ""The decision has not been made lightly and the University is genuinely committed to supporting staff, students and our valued customers through this process,"" Professor Perkins said. The university will cease operations at Dayboro on June 30, but with the expression of interest process continuing into September for a new clinic operator, UQ said it would ""continue to support the clinic operating"".

7,"How turning off lights helps shearwater fledglings embark on 15,000km migration north",science,"  Lights go out on Phillip Island to aid shearwater fledglings on their migration to Alaska For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Businesses on Phillip Island have been turning out their lights at night to help prevent shearwater fledglings from becoming disorientated as they embark on their annual migration to Alaska — a 15,000-kilometre journey. As part of the 'Dark skies so shearwaters fly' campaign, 23 businesses turned off their lights in the evening so shearwaters taking off from breeding colonies on the island, 140 kilometres south of Melbourne, did not become distracted. Phillip Island Nature Parks deputy research manager, Duncan Sutherland, said the campaign was aimed at saving the birds, which tended to fly towards lights and land, often on roads. ""Artificial lights pose a real threat to the fledglings,"" he said. ""When they do land on roads, they run the very real risk of being struck by motorists, which obviously is not very good for their chances of successfully migrating, but also causes a danger to motorists as well."" The last of the shearwaters, which Mr Sutherland said were vital to the island's ecology, took off at the weekend, when the winds were up. Westernport Water communications and engagement manager Geoff Russell said the initiative was important to the island's businesses and residents. ""It’s about community. I’ve personally had to pick a few chicks off the road. You know each year to sort of do our bit,"" Mr Russell said. ""As a resident and local business, we're all in this together, we live alongside the wildlife on this beautiful island."" The staff and volunteers at Phillip Island Nature Parks have also participated in rescue missions as part of this project to save as many shearwater chicks as possible. ""There are staff and volunteers from the nature parks that remove those fledglings before they get hit by motorists,"" Mr Sutherland said. ""We've had lots of support from VicRoads, who have helped by turning lights off on the bridge that connects Phillip Island to the mainland."" Mr Sutherland stressed how important it was for park rangers and communities to protect the shearwater species into the future. ""As the environment changes, they're also going to change so all the incredible influence that they have on islands and marine systems are likely to change too,"" he said. Every year the shearwaters — also known as mutton birds — make a 15,000km journey from the northern hemisphere to breeding sites in Victoria and Bass Strait. Then, once the fledglings are strong enough, the great migration north begins. This year shearwater fledglings had to wait for strong westerly winds to help them on their journey to Alaska. Due to the length of their migratory route, the birds have developed a very efficient flying technique that relies on very strong winds. ""What they're doing is using the winds that push across the oceans, it's the waves that push the winds up … and the fledglings use that uplift to keep them up,"" Mr Sutherland said. He said the shearwaters were an essential part of Phillip Island's ecology as well as providing great opportunities for monitoring and research for the nature parks' researchers. ""They actually bring lots of nutrients from the oceans, and when they come to land, they deposit a lot of those nutrients and that forms really important things like some of the vegetation communities,"" he said. ""They have the fifth largest impact amongst the sea birds in terms of their role in as a predator in the marine environment,"" he said.

8,We fact checked Morrison and Albanese at the third leaders' debate. Here's what we found,science," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes Fact checking Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese in the third leaders' debate For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The third leaders' debate on the Seven Network on Wednesday night was a much more subdued affair than the fiery, more shouty clash between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese on Sunday. But in politics, less shouting doesn't necessarily mean fewer furphies. It only means they are uttered at a lower volume. And so it was in the third meeting of the two leaders before the election. RMIT ABC Fact Check has rounded up some of the key claims where the leaders got their facts straight, and where they missed the mark. Hoping to score points on economic equality for women, both men took swings at their opponent's records. ""The gender pay gap has fallen from 17.4 per cent under Labor to 13.8 per cent where it is now,"" Mr Morrison claimed. ""It even went down to 13.4 per cent."" Mr Albanese, meanwhile, opted for an international comparison. ""Australia has fallen to 70th in the world for women's economic participation and opportunity,"" he noted. Both claims, however, lack some important context. Figures from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency do indeed show that the pay gap in Australia (the difference in average full time earnings for men and women) is currently 13.8 per cent, was as low as 13.4 per cent in early 2021, and was recorded at 17.4 per cent when Labor left office in 2013. But those figures hide an increase in the gender pay gap when the Coalition first came to power: Fact Check found in 2018 that the gap had grown to 18.5 per cent by November 2014. In 2018, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, as well as a number of other Coalition MPs, said that the gender pay gap had fallen under the Coalition. Moreover, experts have previously told Fact Check that the gender pay gap is driven primarily by economic trends, rather than government policy, with a booming economy leading to a larger gap and a stagnating economy causing the gap to narrow. This is because men are more highly concentrated in industries more susceptible to the highs and lows of the economic cycle, such as mining, and would see their wages grow at a slower rate compared to women's during economic downturns (or faster during booms). Mr Albanese's claim, meanwhile, appears to refer to a World Economic Forum report which ranks countries based on the women's economic participation and opportunity. Australia's 2021 ranking, the latest available, aligns with the Opposition Leader's claim. In 2018, former Australian Human Rights commission president Emeritus Professor Gillian Triggs said that Australia's gender gap has regressed in the world rankings over the past six or eight years. Placing 70th of 156 countries, this rank represents an ongoing slip for Australia, which ranked 49th in 2020, 46th in 2018 and 42nd in 2017. It's important to note, however, the WEF report focuses on measuring gaps in access to resources and opportunities rather than actual levels of available resources and opportunities in countries. As one expert told Fact Check in 2018, the WEF report was ""useful for rhetorical purposes"" but may not be ""telling us much about the absolute or objective reality of lives in each country"". Another noted that countries with low levels of absolute achievement could do well in the rankings if the gap between men and women was small. That said, the experts also acknowledged that gender equality in Australia had regressed. Issues of integrity in politics entered the debate when the two leaders found themselves in an argument over the government's proposed model for a federal anti-corruption commission. Mr Morrison argued the government's proposed model for its Commonwealth Integrity Commission released last year had the ""powers of a royal commission"" including ""powers of search, powers compelling witnesses"". In a previous investigation Fact Check found a claim by Social Services Minister Anne Ruston that the Coalition's model boasted powers ""well in excess of a royal commission"" to be overblown. While the new body would have some powers comparable to those of a royal commission — including powers to enter and search premises and compel witnesses to testify, as suggested by Mr Morrison — there are other significant differences between the two. Fact Check found the Royal Commissions Act was relatively brief, leaving scope for commissioners to use their powers broadly. In contrast, the much longer draft bill to establish the CIC imposed many constraints, including how investigations could be initiated and carried out. In particular, there were significant limitations on the powers in the proposed ""public sector division"", covering most of the public service, parliamentarians, higher education providers and research bodies. In this division, the CIC would lack the power to hold public hearings — a function that legal experts told Fact Check increased the effectiveness of royal commissions and contributed to their investigative ability. There are also limitations in the public sector division on what types of conduct can be investigated, who can be investigated and how much of its work can be reported publicly, in contrast to royal commissions. Experts told Fact Check that these restrictions undercut the new body's powers in a way that did not apply to royal commissions. They also pointed out that the CIC would have less ability than a royal commission to exercise the powers it did have, because its proposed annual budget fell well below the cost of many single-issue royal commissions. In response to Mr Morrison's claims about the powers of the proposed CIC, Mr Albanese argued it needed to be ""independent of politics"" saying that under the government's model ""ministers would decide"" whether something was referred to the new body. As explained in Fact Check's assessment of Senator Ruston's claim, the Coalition's proposal would see the CIC split into two divisions. Social Services Minister Anne Ruston says the government's model for a federal integrity commission has powers ""well in excess"" of a royal commission. Is that correct? RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates. As mentioned above, the ""public sector integrity division"" would investigate parliamentarians, the public service, higher education providers and other Commonwealth entities The ""law enforcement integrity division"" on the other hand would have jurisdiction over certain federal law enforcement agencies, such as the federal police, as well as public sector agencies with investigative functions, like the Department of Home Affairs. Under sections 33 to 36 of the exposure draft, referrals in the public sector division can only be made by certain individuals including the Attorney-General, the responsible minister for the agency investigated, Commonwealth Integrity Office Holders and certain parliamentarians. Meanwhile, under section 44, investigations in the law enforcement division can be referred by anyone — including members of the public. Associate professor and deputy director of the Australian Centre for Justice Innovation at Monash University Yee-Fui Ng previously told Fact Check there were significant constraints on the referral process in the public sector division that prevented it from acting on tip-offs from the public or whistleblowers. ""The [public sector division of the] CIC has less powers than equivalent oversight bodies (such as the Ombudsman and Auditor-General) as it cannot conduct own-motion investigations or receive referrals directly from the public,"" she said. This issue was also raised by the Grattan Institute, The Law Council of Australia and the Australian Human Rights Commission in their responses to the exposure draft of the government's legislation. In an attack on Mr Albanese, Mr Morrison suggested his opponent ""doesn't think through"" his policies. ""He has got a housing policy where if you get a wage rise you've got to sell your house,"" Mr Morrison said. But that's not quite correct. Labor's Help to Buy scheme would see the government own as much as a 40 per cent stake in homes bought by qualifying low-to-moderate-income earners, who would need to contribute only 60 per cent of the purchase price. If elected, Labor would make the scheme available to up to 10,000 home buyers per year whose annual income is less than $90,000 (for singles) and $120,000 (for couples). According to the policy on Labor's website: ""If the homebuyer's income exceeds the Help to Buy gross annual income threshold for two consecutive years, they will be required to repay the Government's financial contribution in part or whole as their circumstances permit."" Labor's policy does not detail how long buyers would have to repay the government, nor does it stipulate that a house would need to be sold in order to make the repayments. Additionally, Shadow Finance Minister Richard Marles has explained that the policy is directed at long-term low-to-moderate income earners who otherwise ""face a lifetime of renting"", rather than those expected to see large increases in income. Mr Albanese sought to connect action on climate change with lower electricity prices, claiming: ""Renewables are the cheapest form of new energy."" In 2019, Fact Check tested a similar claim from former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who tweeted that ""renewables + storage are cheaper than new coal let alone … nuclear power."" In 2018, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said new generation from renewables plus storage is cheaper than new coal or nuclear generation. That claim was found to be a fair call. The verdict was based on a 2018 report released by the national science agency CSIRO and the energy market operator AEMO. The report was part of the GenCost project, ""the result of a collaboration between CSIRO and AEMO, together with stakeholder input, to deliver an annual process of updating electricity generation costs"". The lead author Paul Graham, who is the CSIRO's chief energy economist, said when the report was released: ""Our data confirms that while existing fossil fuel power plants are competitive due to their sunk capital costs, solar and wind generation technologies are currently the lowest-cost ways to generate electricity for Australia, compared to any other new-build technology. ""At a global level, the investment costs of a wide range of low emission generation technologies are projected to continue to fall, and we found new-build renewable generation to be least cost, including when we add the cost of two or six hours of energy storage to wind and solar."" The latest update of the report was released at the end of 2021. Upon its release, the CSIRO said: ""The latest 2021-22 report confirmed past years' findings that solar and wind are cheapest, even when considering their additional integration costs such as storage and transmission."" The project calculates the ""levelised cost of energy"" (LCOE) for generating new power, for example, building a new coal-fired power plant or a wind farm. ""LCOE converts all costs into annual operating costs (i.e. capital costs are amortised into equivalent annual payments), adds them together and divides them by annual output in energy terms, typically MWhs,"" the 2018 report said. It added that LCOE ""needs to be extended in light of the greater emphasis on variable renewables in the electricity system and their additional balancing costs which are not captured by LCOE calculations"". Leading experts consulted by Fact Check at the time pointed out that new coal-fired power plants would most likely be required to accept a ""risk premium"" when obtaining finance, reflecting uncertainty over international and domestic climate and energy policy, future clean-up costs, and higher construction risks. According to some estimates, interest rates faced by new coal projects as a consequence would be twice those applying to wind or solar projects. Factoring this in makes new coal a less attractive proposition. Data supplied to Fact Check by the CSIRO in 2019 confirmed that even when incorporating the cost of storage, renewables were cheaper for new power generation than coal when incorporating this risk premium, as well as small scale nuclear. A graph taken from the most recent report similarly shows solar and wind well underneath all other non-renewables for LCOE in 2021. Mr Morrison boasted of his government's response to COVID-19, arguing Australia had done well despite ""a pandemic where the economic impacts have been 30 times worse than what occurred in the global financial crisis just over a decade ago"" . Fact Check looked at this claim in 2021, finding Mr Morrison was comparing apples and oranges, with experts arguing that his approach was not the normal way of assessing two economic periods. Justifying a big-spending budget, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Parliament that coronavirus had ""raged through the developed world and is now raging through the developing world"" in a far more devastating way than the global financial crisis. In fact, they said his claim was confusing, misleading and most likely wrong, while noting that the two recessions were fundamentally different in nature. Experts also told Fact Check that, although the final numbers were not yet in, they expected that an orthodox comparison would reveal the pandemic downturn of 2020 to be twice the magnitude of the GFC, or possibly similar. When it came to jobs and skills, Mr Morrison repeated a furphy that his government was ""providing record numbers of apprenticeships"". That claim is in the ballpark in nominal terms, but as Fact Check has pointed out previously it says little about the current situation relative to previous years, given population changes. When Mr Morrison says ""record numbers"", Fact Check takes him to be repeating his recent, clearer claim that there were ""more apprentices in trade training today, 220,000 of them, than we have had since records began in 1963"". Things look very different when the numbers are viewed as rates that take population into account, for example, as a share of the employed population or of the working age population (aged 15-64). In 2021, apprentices made up 1.6 per cent of the employed population compared with a peak of 2.3 per cent in 1982. And they made up 1.3 per cent of the working age population compared with 1.5 per cent in 1974. It's also worth noting that apprentice numbers have been significantly boosted by temporary pandemic-era wage subsidies since 2020, having previously fallen by 27,000 over the Coalition's first seven years. Mr Morrison included Medicare bulk-billing rates in a list of reasons to vote for the Coalition. ""Bulk billing at 88.8 per cent. It's up from 82.2 when we first came to government."" While Mr Morrison did not specify whether he was referring to all services covered by Medicare or just GP visits, his comment aligns with the rate of GP services bulk billed — 88.8 per cent — in the 2020-21 financial year. The bulk billing rate for all Medicare services in 2020-21 was 81 per cent. At the end of Labor's last full financial year in office, 2012-13, the rate of GP services bulk billed was 82.2 per cent and for all Medicare services was 76.5 per cent. However, as Fact Check has pointed out previously, these statistics refer to the proportion of services bulk billed, not the number of patients. In its 2020 Health of the Nation report, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners explained that patients could receive a number of services during a single visit to a GP, with some of these services bulk-billed and others billed privately. Additionally, experts have previously explained to Fact Check that some groups of people are more likely to be bulk billed, such as concession card holders, visit the GP more often than those who aren't bulk billed. This means that the rate of bulk-billed services does not directly translate to the bulk-billing rate for individuals. The Health of the Nation Report noted that in 2018-19, 86 per cent of GP services were bulk billed, but only 66 per cent of patients had all their GP services bulk billed. Asked a question about how productivity could be increased, Mr Albanese attacked the government's record on economic management. ""There's nothing productive about doubling the debt before the pandemic that occurred,"" Mr Albanese said. As Fact Check has previously found, the dollar value of government debt had indeed doubled, in nominal terms, under the Coalition over the years to January 2020. Official monthly data shows that gross debt had grown $280.3 billion to $568.1 billion (103 per cent) since the 2013 election, while net debt — which better reflects the government's capacity to pay its debt — had risen from $174.6 billion to $430.2 billion (146 per cent). A fairer comparison would, however, also take into account the size of the economy, which accounts for the passage of time and inflation. Data from the 2022-23 budget, which is produced on a financial year basis, doesn't align neatly with electoral dates or the start of the pandemic. It shows that between June 2013, three months before the Coalition was elected, and June 2019, seven months before the pandemic, gross debt as a share of GDP grew by 65 per cent, and net debt by 85 per cent.

9,"Creator of the world famous Pink Lady apple, West Australian John Cripps, dies aged 95 ",science," ABC Rural Pink Lady and Sundowner-Joya apple creator, West Australian John Cripps, dies aged 95 For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A Western Australian man known across the globe as the breeder of the Pink Lady apple, John Cripps, has died at the age 95. He has been described by those that knew him as a quiet gentleman who was passionate and dedicated to the art of plant breeding. The British-Australian horticulturalist carried out his research in WA's Department of Agriculture. Mr Cripps' name also adorns another of his cultivars, the Cripps Red — a late-season variety of the Pink Lady marketed as the Sundowner and Joya. He was formally recognised in 2010 when inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Royal Agricultural Society of Western Australia for his influence on Australia's apple industry. Mr Cripps was also named an Officer in the Order of Australia in 2015 for his ""distinguished service to primary industry through internationally renowned, innovative contributions to the agriculture and food sectors, and to the community"". Mr Cripp's daughter, Helen Cripps, said the family was proud of his contribution to horticulture in Australia. ""We are so proud that he's left a legacy,"" Dr Cripps said. ""It took 25 years of research to develop the apple genetics of the Pink Lady to the point it's at today."" Since its release in 1991, the Pink Lady variety has become internationally recognised as a success story, listed in the top 100 greatest inventions from Australia. In 2015, the Cripps Pink — the cultivar of the apple sold under the trademark name Pink Lady — accounted for more than 30 per cent of Australian apple production. Prominent Manjimup producer and Newton Orchards owner Harvey Giblett said he had the pleasure of working with John Cripps over the years. ""I always found him very calm and quiet, but beneath that he was quite determined and dedicated in what he was doing,"" he said. ""As a Pink Lady grower I'm proud that the variety was bred right here in WA. ""It's pretty amazing, really, because he's created a world-class apple. ""Even to this day it's still growing in popularity around the world."" Australian Pear and Apples Ltd CEO Phil Turnbull said Mr Cripps made an enormous contribution to the apple industry, both in Australia and internationally. ""John’s painstaking work produced an apple that has become one of the most successful and best loved apples worldwide,"" he said. Internationally, Pink Lady apples are grown and consumed from South Africa, Chile, and New Zealand to North America and Europe. Mr Turnbull said the decision to market Cripps Pink under the Pink Lady brand had also changed the face of apple marketing. ""John leaves behind an incredible legacy, and we thank him for it,"" Mr Turnbull said.

10,'A lot of biblical events tend to happen': Sperm donor secrecy sees records unnecessarily withheld,science,"  Sperm-donor-conceived Queenslanders turn to DNA databases to track down biological fathers For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency After years of desperately searching for their sperm-donor fathers, Queenslanders Kate Drysdale and Kerri Favarato used an ancestry DNA database and turned detective to find them. But as a Queensland Parliamentary committee prepares to investigate law reform around donor conception, both women hope the journey for others in their position — those conceived when sperm donation was cloaked in secrecy — is not as fraught. The women were conceived in different decades but with help from the same Brisbane fertility clinic. During multiple contacts with the clinic to request information about their biological fathers, they were separately told by different people at different times medical records may have been damaged by smoke and floods, or lost, or destroyed. ""A lot of Biblical events tend to happen within the record departments of fertility clinics,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""I don't mean to be facetious but so many donor-conceived people have been told that."" Having children of their own has intensified their desire to learn more about their biological heritage. Both women turned to science — and an American direct-to-consumer DNA testing company and database — to continue the search. So-called ancestry databases allow people to compare their own DNA against other publicly available genetic profiles to help them find blood relatives and to build a family tree. In the cases of Ms Drysdale, 30, and Ms Favarato, 39, it allowed them to identify their biological fathers even though neither man had registered a DNA sample on a consumer database at that time. Soon after giving birth to her daughter, Brisbane-based Ms Favarato spent five months of painstaking work piecing together her family tree after finding on a database a fourth cousin — a woman she shared great, great, great grandparents with. ""It was exhausting and really hard work but I needed it to be done,"" she said. ""I was so sick of going through the process of trying to find information and getting the door slammed in my face. ""I just went: 'This is my chance, I have to do this'."" By this stage, Ms Favarato had already spent about two decades looking. As a teenager, after learning her biological father had probably been a medical student, Ms Favarato accessed University of Queensland medical graduate records for the relevant years of the 1980s, making a list of potential candidates. ""I crossed out anyone that had an Asian or Indian sounding name and I crossed out all of the females,"" she said. ""Then I started writing letters to doctors, going: 'Are you my donor?'."" It came to nought. Years later, in February 2017, through DNA searches for blood relatives and hundreds of hours of detective work to develop her family tree, she finally had a match to a Brisbane doctor — Donald 'Digger' Whittaker. Impatient to speak to him, rather than write an email, she picked up the phone and dialled his clinic, leaving a message for him to return her call about ""a private family matter"". Within minutes, he called back. ""How do I know you?"" Dr Whittaker asked. ""Did you donate sperm in the 80s? I think you're my biological father,"" Ms Favarato replied. ""Oh my goodness. Hello darling. How are you? Tell me about yourself,"" Dr Whittaker answered. Five years on, they have what Ms Favarato describes as an ""undefinable"" relationship with ""reasonably regular"" contact. They visit each other's homes and she introduces him to people as ""my biological father"". ""He doesn't call me his daughter or anything like that,"" Ms Favarato said. ""We don't have the same relationship that I have with the dad who raised me. It's not like that, but it's an undeniable connection. ""We just don't bother labelling anything. It is what it is."" Kate Drysdale, who lives in Atherton, in Queensland's far north, with partner Andrew and their young son, has known she was donor-conceived since the age of seven. By then, her mother Carol and her non-biological father had divorced and he was no longer in their lives. ""My legal father and my mother disagreed as to whether or not I should be told. She'd always wanted me to know,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""She has a social work background. She understood the importance of knowing one's identity."" Before having her own child, Ms Drysdale had ""essentially given up"" on the idea of ever finding her biological father, given he had donated his sperm anonymously in the 1990s. She grew up knowing only that he had brown hair and green eyes and was a university student, based on information her mother had been provided by the clinic. But Ms Drysdale's desire to learn more about her genetic background grew after she gave birth to a son five years ago. Her son was still a baby when a television news story on donor conception triggered a renewed interest in her origins. With the support of her mother and after repeated phone calls and emails to the fertility clinic, she was able to obtain scant details about her biological father. Ms Drysdale's biological father had been a humanities student, his blood type was O-positive, he had three brothers and he was 21 years old at the time of his donation. After continuing to ""harass"" the clinic, she also learned of at least one donor-conceived half sibling, but the clinic could not tell her a gender or a birth date. ""Parents were not required to inform clinics whether the procedures had been successful and resulted in a child,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""Even if they had been recording information correctly, they weren't being provided it."" Finding contact with the fertility clinic tortuous, Ms Drysdale had her DNA tested and her genetic profile uploaded onto an online database. A couple of matches with distant cousins, including a 100-year-old woman living in Brisbane, who had already built an ""extensive family tree"", and another living in the United Kingdom, allowed her to trace her biological father's identity, using the small amount of information she was able to glean from the fertility clinic. It took her just three weeks. ""To be honest … If you get the matches through the DNA testing, it's not that hard to work out who the donor is,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""I knew nothing when I started."" As she contemplated her next step, the fertility clinic contacted her unexpectedly, telling her they had managed to track down her biological father and would organise mandatory counselling sessions before a potential meeting. Although she already knew his name, and how to contact him, Ms Drysdale chose to go down the clinic path fearing he may view being approached directly as ""disrespectful or invasive"". It would take a year before she finally had email contact with him and about two years before they finally met in Atherton in late 2020 along with his wife and their two children. ""The first question his wife asked me was: 'Do you have an overlapping tooth, too?',"" Ms Drysdale recalled. ""And I do. ""I always thought I looked like my mother until I met that man. He is the male version of me, just 21 years older."" Ms Drysdale and her biological father are both employed in the social science field, but more important to her is his personality. ""I had a negative view of what a father was growing up,"" she said. ""It's just really nice to find out that he is a positive, empathetic, kind human being that thinks about the world and wants to have a positive influence on it. ""So it's nice that that's the personality that I come from."" Meeting her biological father took years of trauma and heartache. The distress was only compounded when he told her he had given his details to the fertility clinic years earlier, making it clear he was open to contact, before she began her search for him. ""They either had no record of that, or … they just didn't bother to say anything,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""The clinic should have been able to simply consult their records, advise that he was open to contact and connect us. ""Instead, I experienced many months living in a state of near panic that I would not get any information or would ultimately be rejected by the person I had been searching for for so long."" Ms Drysdale is one of about 70 people who have made submissions to the Queensland parliament's Legal Affairs and Safety Committee's inquiry into matters relating to donor conception information, which will hear evidence on Friday. Her detailed 11-page submission calls for the establishment of a donor conception register, mandating clinics to provide ""full and accurate"" information in a timely manner, with penalties for non-compliance. She wants all donor-conceived people to also be able to access identifying information relating to donors and donor-conceived siblings, regardless of when they were conceived. Ms Drysdale would also like to see the birth certificates of donor-conceived people include a notation indicating they are donor conceived, with contact details for how to access further information. Given that some people source donor sperm, eggs or embryos from overseas, she is also calling for a ban on the importation of reproductive tissue if the international clinics involved cannot be held to Queensland standards. Her calls echo those of Donor Conceived Australia (DCA), an advocacy and support group for people conceived via assisted reproductive treatments, which has more than 500 members. DCA's 27-page submission to the parliamentary inquiry requests opt-in counselling for donor-conceived individuals, donors and their families as ""an essential aspect of managing information relating to donor conception"". ""Currently, there are no Queensland-based counselling services providing specialised support in the donor-conception sphere,"" the submission stated. It called for counselling to be provided by professionals not involved or affiliated with the fertility industry to ensure confidence they are ""independent, objective and focused on the interests of that client"". We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. DCA director Aimee Shackleton said her Queensland members often reported seeking help from local psychologists with ""absolutely no idea"" how to support them through the complex issues involved with donor conception. ""Donor Conceived Australia is hoping to be involved in creating competency-based accreditation courses for mental health professionals and calls for government-funded counselling to support donor-conceived people when they need it most,"" she said. Ms Shackleton said donor-conceived adults often turned to her organisation after years of searching for donors and after frequently being turned away by fertility clinics. ""They find there are no government agencies to help them,"" she said. ""They often realise they need to spend hundreds of dollars to send their genetic material to an American-based DNA company. ""Many also turn to paying professional genealogists or private investigators to do the work for them."" Since Kerri Favarato found her biological father, with her encouragement, Dr Whittaker has also supplied his own DNA profile to the same database that helped her find him. That resulted in Ms Favarato discovering six donor-conceived half siblings, all of them previously unaware they were conceived using donor sperm. ""Two of them I speak with very regularly. We've become almost like very close friends. We speak quite often,"" Ms Favarato said. As a young medical student, Dr Whittaker donated sperm two or three times a week for five years. It's impossible to know how many children he may have fathered, leaving Ms Favarato concerned about the unknown number of cousins her own children may have and the future potential for them to end up in a relationship with one of them. ""I have a nine-year-old and a five-year-old. They've got lots of cousins floating around,"" she said. ""When you talk about the numbers, it could be anywhere from 30 to 300, maybe more than that. Who knows? We don't know for sure. We'll never know. ""That's [lots of] first cousins running around that they have the potential to have relationships with."" Queensland fertility clinics are subject to National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines, which have required since September 2004 that donations of sperm, eggs and embryos can only take place if donors first consent to their information being made available, on request, once any conceived children turn 18. Under the guidelines, clinics must also take all reasonable steps to reduce the numbers of genetic relatives created through their donor programs. The Fertility Society of Australia's reproductive technology accreditation committee advises that ""a maximum of 10 donor families"" per sperm donor is acceptable, regardless of where those families are. University of Western Sydney law professor Sonia Allan, who has been studying legal issues surrounding donor conception for 20 years, described the accreditation committee system as ""self regulatory"". ""It is important to recognise that while advice or guidelines play an important role in setting standards, they do not have the force of the law,"" Professor Allan said. ""You should have the law behind it. What happens is that if it doesn't have legal force, the risk is, and this is certainly a risk in Queensland, that you have individuals or clinics who don't follow the guidance, as there is no enforceable obligation to do so. ""That can result in people having many more donor-conceived siblings than perhaps they should. ""Combined with a lack of information about their donor-conceived status and/or their biological relatives, this leads to an increased chance of them forming relationships with each other, meaning sexual relationships, because they don't know who their first-degree relatives are. ""You also create a situation where donor-conceived people live in fear or constant uncertainty. The impact on some people's lives is really unacceptable."" The Queensland parliamentary committee is due to hand down its report on donor conception law reform in August. As she awaits the outcome, Kate Drysdale will continue to build a relationship with her biological father. ""We will never have a father-daughter relationship because you can't get back 30 years of history,"" she said. ""I talk to him probably every couple of weeks on the phone, we update each other about what's happening in our lives. I see him as a friend."" Ms Drysdale's hopeful things will be different for her son — her biological father's first grandchild.

11,We're about to see the first glimpses of the monster lurking in the heart of our galaxy,science," Science Event Horizon Telescope set to reveal 'exciting results' about the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency There's a monster lurking in the heart of our galaxy, and we may get our first glimpses of it tonight. At 11pm AEST, an international team of scientists will reveal what they're calling a ""groundbreaking"" discovery from our galactic centre — and you'll be able to watch it live. There are rumbles the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) will unveil images of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the middle of the Milky Way. In 2019, the EHT captured the first-ever images of the swirling mass of superheated dust and gas surrounding a supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy 55 million light-years away called M87. The image of M87's black hole silhouetted by a bright ""ring"" of emissions bent by gravity was a ""huge day in astrophysics"", according to France Córdova, director of the US National Science Foundation at the time. ""We're seeing the unseeable."" But top of the bucket list for the EHT — a planet-wide network of 11 observatories — is the black hole lurking at the centre of our own galaxy. Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A* for short, lies 27,000 light-years away, and is a lightweight in the supermassive stakes, at only about 4 million times the mass of our Sun. Will we see its event horizon? If so, will it look like the image snapped of M87? Getting a glimpse of our cosmic monster will help us understand the evolution of our galaxy, says Joss Bland-Hawthorn, an astrophysicist at the University of Sydney who studies Sgr A* but is not involved with the EHT. ""No-one knows for sure [what the image] will be, but everyone imagines it's going to be different from just seeing a shadow,"" Professor Bland-Hawthorn said. Here's what we know so far about the behemoth parked in the middle of our galaxy. Most galaxies have a supermassive black hole more than a million times the mass of our Sun at their heart. While astronomers suspected for decades our galaxy might harbour one, it was not pinned down until two separate teams in the US and Germany started studying the precise movements of stars around our galactic centre in the 1990s. ""They tracked these stars over the course of 20 or so years, and realised that the stars were moving under the influence of a very, very massive, dense, dark blob,"" Professor Bland-Hawthorn said. Their measurements indicated the blob was about 4 million times the mass of our Sun. ""They got that region down to such a tiny region, it could only be a black hole or something that behaves like a black hole."" Andrea Ghez and Reinhard Genzel, who led the teams, shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work. We cannot see black holes directly. At their centre, gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. To snap a portrait of a black hole, the EHT detects light beamed out by hot gas swirling around the edge of the black hole's disc. But until now, our view of the black hole at the centre of our galaxy has been limited to the effects of its immense gravitational tug on material whizzing around it. In 2010, we got the best look at the centre of our galaxy when the Chandra X-ray Observatory took a snapshot that showed the remains of a massive explosion near Sgr A* and large bubbles of hot gas extending for a dozen light-years on either side of the black hole, as well as mysterious X-ray filaments. While our galaxy's central black hole flings nearby stars back out into space, and there may be a weak jet of X-rays coming from its centre, it is relatively quiet compared to other black holes. But the large bubbles first identified in X-rays by Professor Bland-Hawthorn's research, then in gamma rays by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, show it wasn't always like this. Professor Bland-Hawthorn said these billowing clouds, known as Fermi bubbles, showed something happened at the centre of the galaxy 2 to 3 million years ago. ""The evidence is overwhelming that [the bubbles were] powered by a past explosion from the black hole,"" he said. At 6.5 billion times the mass of the Sun, the black hole in the centre of M87 is one of the largest supermassive black holes in our neck of the universe. So how does it compare to Sgr A*? ""Our black hole is nothing like the black hole in M87,"" Professor Bland-Hawthorn said. For one, M87's black hole is more massive — way more. Generally, the bigger the galaxy, the heftier its central black hole. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is about half the size of M87 and contains about a 10th of the stars, so it follows that our supermassive black hole would be smaller too. Sgr A* is also nowhere near as active as M87, which is feeding on gas and stars and blasting out radiation. ""So we don't have a lot of radiation that helps us generate some kind of a shadow,"" Professor Bland Hawthorn said. And because SgrA* is changing much faster than the lumbering M87*, it has been much more challenging to get images that aren't blurred. The EHT team previously modelled what it suspected the black hole might look like in short radio wavelengths of 1.3 millimetres. Like the image of M87's black hole, the simulation of Sgr A* is fuzzy due to the distortion of gas and dust around the black hole and its crushing gravity. Given the hype, images of Sgr A* will likely be more than the gold-and-orange donut of M87's emission ring, Professor Bland-Hawthorn said. ""I'm going to predict some kind of a jet phenomenon or some kind of focused collimated something, like a jet or a bubble blasting off right from the black hole region."" Professor Bland-Hawthorn and colleagues have published evidence of a weak jet coming from the centre of the Milky Way. Jets are a phenomenon seen in other galaxies, including M87 and Centaurus A's central black hole, as captured by the EHT and reported last year. James Miller-Jones, an astrophysicist at Curtin University and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, expects to see images of a supermassive black hole with a more dynamic environment than what the EHT captured in 2019. That's because the timescales during which a black hole's surrounds change — such as variations in the hot, turbulent gas swirling around it — get longer the more massive the black hole is. For hefty M87*, changes in its environment are predicted to happen on the scale of days to weeks. Want more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel. The more diminutive Sgr A*, on the other hand, should experience changes in the order of minutes, Professor Miller-Jones said — certainly fast enough to be detected during a handful of hours of observation. ""It is unclear whether the observed emission will come from the hot gas swirling around it, or from a low-level jet, either of which could vary with time."" Yet another possibility is that the supermassive black hole is not one, but two black holes, circling each other in a colossal waltz. Pairs of black holes dwelling in galactic centres are not unusual, says Alister Graham, a Swinburne University astrophysicist who studies supermassive black holes. For instance, last year he and colleagues reported that the galaxy NGC 4424 houses a pair of supermassive black holes, brought together during a galactic merger. ""Typically, astronomers do not have the spatial resolution to see if there are two or more black holes in close orbit [in the centre of the Milky Way], so for simplicity's sake we just refer to the total central mass as a single mass,"" Professor Graham said. So if more than one supermassive black hole was found in the centre of our galaxy, ""it would be a remarkable measurement and one that has long been expected"", he added. ""Our Milky Way has many debris trails from smaller galaxies … which have been captured and torn apart. ""Some of these captives may well have delivered massive black holes that are now on their way to, or already at, the centre of our galaxy."" Get all the latest science stories from across the ABC.

12,Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love?,science,"  Do those viral '36 questions' actually lead to finding love? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The ""36 questions of love"" have taken the dating world by storm. First published in 1997 as part of scientific research into relationships, the 36 questions of love gained global popularity through Mandy Len Catron's viral 2015 New York Times essay ""To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This"". In that essay, she outlines how she used the 36 questions with a university acquaintance on a casual night out. The result was the two fell in love, not dissimilar to two research participants who took part in the study back in 1997. In the publishing of that essay, a phenomenon was born. Social media, dating websites, dating coaches and bloggers were posting, writing or discussing the 36 questions of love — often framing these questions as a surefire method to find love — backed by science. As people attempted the 36 questions of love during dates, it became clear the 36 questions typically did not result in people falling in love. The 36 questions are three sets of 12 questions. Each set is designed to increase the amount of information a person discloses about themselves to a stranger. Not only does each set of questions increase the amount each person must disclose, but within each set, the questions increase the level of disclosure as they progress. For example, one question in the first set includes ""For what in your life do you feel most grateful?"" The second set includes questions such as ""What is your most treasured memory?"" The final set, which requires the greatest disclosure, includes questions such as ""When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?"". To answer this, one needs to go back to the original paper published by well-known relationships researcher Arthur Aron and colleagues. The research aim was to determine if progressively increasing disclosure increases closeness between two strangers. The research was not designed to test whether the questions lead to love. Instead of upskilling women to cope with the harm they risk in dating men, the self-help industry should focus on male behaviour. Across three studies, Aron and colleagues found support for the idea that a gradual increase in disclosure between strangers is related to an increase in closeness immediately after the experiment. The original research never measured whether people developed feelings of love directly after the experiment or in the future. However, the final study did a brief follow-up with most matched pairs of participants. Seven weeks after participating in the study, it was found 57 per cent of the matched pairs had a follow-up conversation, 35 per cent did something together (no more details were provided), and 37 per cent went on to sit together in class. But again, none of these findings have anything to do with people finding love and going on to have a long-term relationship. If indeed the 36 questions helped Mandy Len Canton find love, that is a positive thing. However, for the dating world to generalise about the love-generating properties of the 36 questions on the basis of one popularised case speaks to how pop culture can heavily misconstrue science. Those of us who study how people fall in love and what makes for a lasting relationship know there are many ingredients that go into making a relationship work. Some of these include: the importance people place on what they want in the ideal partner people's similarities and differences people's history of past relationships styles of dealing with conflict ability to support and respond to a partner in stressful times the alignment of partners' beliefs, values and goals each person's level of commitment and the ability to regulate emotions (and these are just some of the factors). The point of the research conducted by Aron and his colleagues is self-disclosure and enhancing closeness are two factors that matter within the larger scheme of factors. The other important point is the 36 questions provide a structured way to engage in self-disclosure. Research has shown relationships can falter when people disclose too much about themselves early on in the dating process. When people do not know each other well, it can be overwhelming for a person to hear very intimate and personal details about another. They may not know how to respond to the disclosure, or feel uncomfortable themselves. This can result in the person who disclosed coming away from the interaction feeling invalidated and vulnerable. On the other hand, when a person feels their partner responds to their disclosures and vulnerabilities, relationship intimacy is enhanced. But it is a high bar to set early in a relationship to expect a partner to respond appropriately to another who discloses highly personal information about oneself. Generally speaking, over-disclosure in the early stages of relationships can be problematic, especially for those who are anxious about their relationships. So taking a gradual and measured approach to self-disclosure and ensuring each partner has the opportunity to disclose at a comfortable pace is very important. The 36 questions are unlikely to be a ""surefire"" way to find love, but they can help people understand the importance of taking a gradual approach to self-disclosure.

13,"'Devastating': Over 90pc of reefs on Great Barrier Reef suffered bleaching over summer, report reveals",science,"  Great Barrier Reef bleaching occurred on over 90 per cent of reefs this summer, report reveals For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency More than 90 per cent of coral reefs surveyed on the Great Barrier Reef suffered some form of bleaching this summer, according to a new report. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority annual snapshot details how the 2021-22 summer led to a mass bleaching event of coral. It is the fourth mass bleaching event in seven years on the reef and the first to occur under La Niña conditions. The report says a total of 719 reefs between the Torres Strait and the Capricorn Bunker Group, east of Gladstone, in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, were surveyed from the air. Ninety-one per cent of the reefs exhibited some bleaching. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority chief scientist David Wachenfeld said the good news is that early signs suggest a low mortality rate. ""Bleaching is a stress response but bleached coral is still alive and under the right conditions it can recover and continue to live,"" he said. Dr Wachenfeld said the 2016/17 bleaching event had a high mortality rate, while the bleaching that occurred in 2020 did not kill as much coral. ""The early indications are the mortality won't be very high so we are hoping that we will see most of the coral that is bleached recover, and we will end up with an event rather more like 2020 where yes there was mass bleaching but there was low mortality."" The report said bleaching was mostly seen in the northern and central regions of the reef and was more variable in the southern region reflecting the boundary of lower heat stress exposure. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. The Australian Marine Conservation Society's Lissa Schindler said the annual snapshot report was ""devastating"" news. ""This was a La Niña year, normally characterised by more cloud cover and rain. It should have been a welcome reprieve for our reef to help it recover,"" she said. She called for both major parties to increase their 2030 emissions reductions targets in response to this latest mass bleaching event.

15,"This medication is running out and when it's gone, 10 million more people a year could die by 2050",science,"  Antibiotic resistance is threatening our health. Will bacterial infection send us back to the medical dark age? For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Tony Velkov and Jian Li share the kind of geeky science story that would work perfectly as a Hollywood script. On quiet weekends at the Monash University science labs 20 years ago, the pair discovered they were the only ones crazy — or obsessed — enough to be working on their projects while everyone else was at home enjoying a few days off. Then, when Velkov and Li realised they shared not only a work ethic but a passion for researching bacteria, their personal and professional friendship was sealed. ""We were the only guys working Saturday and Sunday and we kept running into each other,"" Velkov remembers. ""From then on it's just been fun, you know, we sit around for hours talking and brainstorming. We have been a really good team."" Over the past 12 years, the two scientists have been developing a new antibiotic that recently began phase 1 clinical trials in the US. Their intravenous drug targets deadly ""superbugs"" that are difficult to treat but can run rampant in hospital settings, causing pneumonia, blood infections, urinary tract infections, peritonitis and meningitis. This promising new drug, with the uninspiring name QPX9003, has placed the pair on the cusp of achieving something that hasn't been done for decades. No new antibiotics in this class — polymyxins, which target hard-to-kill ""gram-negative"" bacteria — have been approved since the 1950s. In March, their research was published in the journal Nature. For anyone researching bacteria and antibiotics, getting a new drug to a clinical trial is the holy grail. But it's been a lonely, gruelling process for Velkov and Li, who have at times stumped up their own cash to keep the research going. ""It can be a thankless job,"" Velkov says matter-of-factly. But why? Without new antibiotics, the world is on track to re-enter the medical dark ages by 2050, when a simple cut could kill 10 million people a year. So why are they so hard to find? For most of us, antibiotics don't feel like a big deal. At the slightest sign of a cough or a rash many GPs will dash off a prescription for antibiotics and we're all ""popping them like Tic Tacs"", Velkov says. While our medical and pharmaceutical resources have been (importantly) absorbed in solving the COVID-19 pandemic, the problem of antibiotic resistance is continuing to gain pace. Each year in Australia more than 55,000 people are diagnosed with sepsis — when an uncontrollable bacterial infection triggers inflammation throughout the body. If it can't be managed, sepsis can lead to organ failure. And effective antibiotics are a key component of treatment. About 8,500 Australians die from sepsis every year. It's a huge figure, far above the annual road toll and higher than deaths from specific cancers, and it has a huge economic impact too: antibiotic resistance costs the economy about $700 million a year. Many scientists, Velkov included, argue the threat ahead from bacteria is equally as serious as that posed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. So why is money to invest in antibiotic research so hard to come by? Just 100 years ago, as many as one in three deaths was caused by bacterial infections developing from injuries that would barely raise an eyebrow these days. Back then, if bacteria entered a cut or infection took hold after surgery, the wounds were doused in bromide — hugely painful and deadly to healthy cells too — or treated with bloodletting and leeches. Then, in September 1928, British scientist Alexander Fleming returned from his summer holiday to find one of the petri dishes of Staphylococcus bacteria in his lab had a big blob of mould growing in the middle of it. Yet the area around the mould was free of bacteria and Fleming wanted to know why. The answer led to the development of the first antibiotic – penicillin – and by the mid-1940s it had become widely available. Medical care was transformed. It used to take a particular bacterial strain a few decades to evolve to overcome the antibiotic designed to kill it. But these days, says Dr Maytham Hussein, a researcher in alternatives to antibiotics from the University of Melbourne, it takes some bacteria only two or three years to learn to resist a particular antibiotic. Some bacteria become resistant before clinical trials have even been completed. The problem is that bacteria reproduce faster than just about anything on the planet, some strains doubling their numbers in under five minutes. As the human population increases (giving bacteria more places to multiply) and more and more of these people use antibiotics to get over their infections or keep them safe after surgery — or agriculture uses antibiotics to keep infection in animals at bay — bacteria have many more opportunities to become resistant. And as this process speeds up, the probability that bacteria will find a way to overcome antibiotics increases. The result is that our stash of usable antibiotics is dwindling. Those golden staph outbreaks we hear of invading hospitals provide a glimpse of what a post-antibiotic world could look like. Or worse still, a return to the bubonic plague pandemic that devastated Europe, Asia and North Africa in the 1300s. There are plenty of medical experts who believe the post-antibiotic era is already here and COVID has supercharged the need to address the problem. Ventilators that are relied on to treat many of COVID's sickest patients in ICU also place those patients at increased risk of bacterial infection. Before COVID, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VaP) was already a widely noted medical phenomenon, affecting between 5 and 40 per cent of intubated patients. Of those diagnosed with VAP, up to 10 per cent die from a bacterial infection, not the illness that brought them to ICU in the first place. But it's not just desperately ill COVID patients who are vulnerable. Without effective antibiotics, the healthcare we take for granted – from giving birth and knee replacements to heart bypass operations and surgery for cancer – would carry the risk, once again, of exposing the patient to a life-threatening infection. ""This is the slow pandemic,"" says Professor Matt Cooper from the Institute of Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland. ""Politicians and funding bodies [respond to] acute crises, and don't get me wrong COVID is a serious disease, but with antibiotic resistance we are like a frog, slowly boiling on a stove."" With so much at stake, you might think that pharmaceutical companies would be tripping over themselves to invest in the next great antibiotic and back the next Alexander Fleming or Tony Velkov. But there's a problem. The speed with which bacteria challenge and overcome new antibiotics isn't just a scientific problem. It is also an economic one: pharmaceutical companies don't have time to make a profit. Of the antibiotics that do make it to market, most are lucky to have a 10-year life span before bacteria become resistant, Velkov says. And when it costs up to $1 billion to develop a marketable drug, a decade isn't enough time for pharmaceutical companies to get their money back and deliver a profit. Tweaking the drugs to give them longevity isn't much help because when global patent laws run out, typically after about 25 years, the generic manufacturers move in. ""There's not much money in antibiotics,"" Velkov says. ""For pharmaceutical companies, it's literally like a charity, a pro-bono activity for them, and they are not investing."" Cooper agrees: ""It is really simple, [the problem is] money, and everyone is leaving the field because it's so depressing. It's really, really hard to stay motivated."" Instead, big pharma is investing in drugs for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, melanoma and blood clots — which made up three of the top five biggest-selling drugs of 2021. Pfizer's COVID vaccine came in at number one. Moderna at number three. Velkov's close relationship with Li has sustained them both through the long years of research with little but their own scientific curiosity to keep them going. But Velkov says he also found motivation from something deeper: the idea that his work could make a difference. ""He's a very good friend of mine and we work really well together,"" Valkov says of Li. ""Many professions become about reputation, ego and achievement, whereas we don't really care what other people think of us. If our work can actually change the way people live, or help them live better, then our work means something. That's what science and medicine is about. When you lose touch with that central philosophy, you're in trouble."" Nevertheless, he admits matter-of-factly that a career devoted to bacteria and developing antibiotics can be ""a thankless job"". The two scientists years ago gave up expecting R&D funding from Australia. Of course, they had support from the university sector and then tipped in more of their own cash at critical moments, but the big investment required to make their new drug a reality came from overseas. ""It's just all about investment and development, that's all it is,"" says Velkov of the difficulty finding new antibiotics. ""We can fix this problem [of antimicrobial resistance] but governments need to prioritise it. They can't rely on drug companies and they can't rely on Jian Li and myself mucking around in the lab on our days off. We are just two blokes trying to scrounge together materials to build something."" With pharmaceutical companies wary of the financial risk of significant investment, a number of government-backed funding bodies have been set up in other countries to support drug development. Velkov and Li received two $US4.5 million donations from a US-government investment fund known as BARDA, the Biological Advanced Research and Development Authority, that enabled them to finish the research for their intravenous antibiotic. He wishes the Australian government had similar investment capacity: ""That's not even possible in Australia. We don't even have grants that size. Down Under, we just do things too small,"" he believes. Even better, Velkov says, would be establishing a global alliance — in particular, partnering with China where significant research is underway — that can pool medical developments for the greater good. It's an idea Cooper has tried several times, currently as a not-for-profit project that screens compounds for antimicrobial activity with a goal to help researchers discover new compounds that are effective against drug-resistant infections. Funding difficulties are only one part of the problem. ""I want to stress that this is tough,"" says Cooper, pointing out that the technical difficulties of finding and developing new antibiotics are real. Researchers have scoured nature to find new antibiotics from coral reefs, soil and even bat dung but ""there hasn't been much success"", says Cooper, who is preparing to publish his findings outlining the key problems facing the development of antibiotics and flags key areas of promising research. Notwithstanding disappointing results from searching the environment for new sources of antibiotics, the importance of protecting nature remains the key, says Velkov. ""Most of our medicines are natural products and we haven't come close to tapping into all of these natural resources,"" he says. Four avenues are being explored to combat the rise of the superbug. One is to continue to push the message that existing antibiotics must be used sparingly and carefully to minimise the potential for bacteria to become immune. Another is reviving antibiotics that were previously passed over because something better came along. Returning to these discoveries saves research and development money, making them a more attractive investment. Scientists are also searching for ways to support or boost the effectiveness of existing antibiotics by using other drugs and therapies, known as ""potentiators"". Maytham Hussein's work looks at the effect of cannabinoids, which if taken in tablet form can boost the performance of antibiotics. Cooper is undertaking associated research that uses peptides as potentiators. Then there is the phage therapies, a branch of medical science that harnesses viruses to attack and kill bacteria. Finally, there is immune modulation known as ""inflabiotics"", which uses similar strategies to the immune therapies being used successfully in cancer treatment. ""These get the ancient part of our immune system, our innate immunity, to stop making 'bad' inflammation and instead clear the infection with 'good' inflammation,"" Cooper says. He anticipates this therapy would face fewer issues with drug resistance because it targets the immune system, not the bug itself. ""If it is viable, it could be broadly applied,"" he says. Cooper is confident more antibiotics can be found or alternative therapies discovered. But he fears the struggle for funding has made bacterial research a disappearing field. He calculates that fewer than 1,400 researchers — experts in bacteria and antibiotics — remain working around the world. Of those, he estimates most are in their 50s and 60s and due to retire in the next decade. ""At some stage, not only will there be no money for research but all those experts will leave the field,"" he says. ""Ninety years of knowledge about how to discover and develop antibiotics, these miracle drugs that have saved more lives than any other drug, will be gone.""
