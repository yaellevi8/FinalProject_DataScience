0,Keeping up with the Kardashians: Women turning to cosmetic surgery to be 'ethnic but not too ethnic',health,"  Why new cosmetic surgery trends that 'pick and choose' from cultures raise cultural appropriation concerns For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Who wins and who loses when beauty trends celebrate cosmetically altered looks that are ethnic — but 'not too ethnic'? Growing up in Sydney, Petronie was taught to be proud of her Blackness. The message was instilled in her by her mum and dad, who are from Zambia and the Republic of the Congo, respectively. ""They were always telling me that I'm Black and I'm beautiful, and just making sure I really believed that,"" Petronie says. Though it was powerful, it still couldn't shield the 26-year-old model and influencer from pervasive western beauty norms. In 2007, when US reality TV stars the Kardashians shot to fame, Petronie was one of the millions of people around the world who began noticing physical alterations in the sisters. In particular, she watched Kim Kardashian's ""nose changes over time"". And whenever Petronie used social media filters — which tweak facial features, often for comedic or beautifying effect — she noticed that some shrank the size of her nose. By the time she was 21, Petronie decided she wanted cosmetic surgery, too. ""I wanted my nose to be a bit thinner and pushed up,"" she says. But Petronie is acutely aware that while cosmetic surgery can erase some features like a non-Caucasian nose, it can also emphasise others, like big lips or almond-shaped eyes. That cosmetic procedures allow people to capitalise on the desirability of those cultural features — while removing others — is a pop culture paradox, and it's impacting the steadily growing number of Australians who are opting for cosmetic procedures. Many are weighing up the relationship between their culture and their appearance, in the face of trends that promote a look of ethnic — but, some argue, ""not too ethnic"" — ambiguity. Adria Goldman is assistant professor of communication and digital studies at the University of Mary Washington in the US. She says the term ""Blackfishing"" describes ""an act of cultural appropriation where someone non-Black tries to present themselves as Black"". That could be through darkening their skin, adopting an Afro-centric hairstyle, or getting a more voluptuous shape, through photo editing or even butt augmentation. ""Oftentimes [it's] for profit or some other personal gain,"" she says. Blackfishing is a criticism that's been levelled at the Kardashians, and other celebrities including Australian singer Iggy Azalea, British singer Rita Ora and American singer Ariana Grande. Some accused of Blackfishing or of cultural appropriation have counter argued that in fact they are enacting cultural ""appreciation"", Dr Goldman says. But, she argues, while intent is worth considering, ultimately it's not the point. ""A person can appropriate Black culture and say that their intention was not to do harm — but appropriating Black culture does do harm,"" she says. It can reinforce ""surface level"" or ""misinformed"" ideas about Black culture. ""It's commodifying this culture with no gain to Black people."" Like Petronie, social media consultant Natasha also watched the Kardashians' appearances morph over time. Natasha is Middle Eastern-Australian and was very insecure about her appearance when she was growing up. ""I never felt like I was the pretty girl, ever. And I think that was because … I was around mostly white people,"" she says. By the end of high school, she had endured years of teasing about her looks. Yet, at the same time, reality TV was demonstrating that appearance isn't fixed. ""I started realising, oh wow, things can be changed,"" Natasha says. So at 18 years of age, Natasha, who is now 26, began cosmetic enhancement — first lip filler, then rhinoplasty or a nose job — to alter what she calls her ""ethnic nose"". But she says that modifying her cultural features has come at a cost. While she publicly, and proudly, identifies as a woman of colour, she says she's been criticised online for having ""absolutely no features that correlate with a woman of colour"" and for being ""white passing"". For Natasha, such statements diminish her personal experience. ""They don't know the torment I went through growing up,"" she says. ""I start to think it's my fault because I've changed my ethnic features. ""But it's so wrong."" Natasha says the comments also diminish the discrimination faced by her Aramaean forebears. ""My people have gone through so much persecution … and even my parents, moving to Australia [have endured] so much hardship,"" she says. The criticism levelled at those who undergo cosmetic surgery to modify their cultural features is one that philosopher and physician Yves Saint James Aquino is familiar with. He has studied the ethics of cosmetic enhancement, specifically blepharoplasty or double eyelid surgery, a procedure that is most popular in South East Asia. Dr Aquino, who is also a research fellow with the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, says people who undergo this surgery are often criticised for ""betraying their heritage"" or being ""a race traitor"". He argues it's a reductive position to take. ""Heritage and culture is more than appearance,"" he says. Dr Aquino believes that people, women specifically, ""should be able to do whatever they want with their body"". But he also believes that ""choice"" to undergo body or face modification is a concept that ""we have to interrogate"" in the context of media, peer group and broader societal pressure. ""Even if no one's pointing a gun at your head, you live through all these pressures, all these directives … [so] is that an authentic choice?"" One of those pressures is social media. Dr Aquino knows of cosmetic surgeons who report that their clients want ""to change their face based on specific [social media] filters"". He says other clients want to alter their noses because the angle of a selfie gives the illusion of an increased nose size. ""So it's a very weird, perceptual thing that's influencing their self-image … it's the way they hold their phone,"" he says. The cosmetic enhancement industry in Australia is booming. We meet the people chasing their aesthetic ideal and those jumping off the cosmetic enhancement conveyor belt. Gemma Sharp has also noticed shifts in cosmetic surgery requests. A clinical psychologist and Senior Research Fellow in the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre, Dr Sharp leads the Body Image Research Group. She says there's been a move away from a ""traditional facelift, which is used to 'rectify' ageing processes"". Rather, ""preventative"" procedures such as fillers are becoming more common among younger people. Dr Sharp says the expansion of the sorts of people having procedures is thanks to reduced costs, increased availability and the normalisation of cosmetic surgery through the media. ""People who tended to seek cosmetic procedures were more likely aged 30 and over in the past, but now we are seeing people seeking them as young as late teens and 20s."" In the last five years or so, there's been a sharp increase in the use of injectables (such as in wrinkle-reducing or lip-filling procedures) in Australia, and the Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) operation, which ""is the fastest growing cosmetic surgery in the world"", Dr Sharp says. At 2018, Australians were spending more per capita on cosmetic surgery than in the US, with anti-wrinkle (Botox) injections the most popular operation at the time. Cosmetic surgery wasn't on the mind of 14-year-old Kina when she started posting selfies on social media. For a long time, Kina, who has Indian heritage, only posted photos with filters applied to them. At first, the filters were ""cute hearts"" or ""a nice background"", she says. ""And I was like, that's lovely."" Then she realised the filters could also ""slim down my nose … make my nose look upturned … make my lips and eyes bigger [and] my face slimmer"" and ""significantly lighten my skin"". ""I looked like a white person,"" Kina says. It began to change the way she thought about herself. ""I was just like, am I not pretty otherwise? It came to the point where I could not take a photo without a filter because I would look at myself and find all these little faults."" Kina started to ask herself, ""Why can't my nose be slimmer? Why can't my lips be bigger? Why can't my face have more of a structure to it instead of being so round?"" She recognised the filters' ""toxic"" influence and today she tries to avoid them. But she's concerned that she and her peers are bombarded on social media with ideals about an ""unattainable body"". ""[The beauty ideal] is very much centred around white women having racially ambiguous features, like those big lips, the very Middle Eastern and South Asian brows and eyes, and Black bodies,"" Kina says. ""It's just very unsustainable because nobody actually looks like that."" And it sends a powerful message of inadequacy to teenagers online. ""If I went and asked younger girls around my age, 'Do you have insecurities? Do you hate anything about yourself?', so many girls will be like, 'I hate my body, I hate my face [or] how my lips look or [how] my eyes look,'"" Kina says. ""If you ask them, 'Do you want to get surgeries when you're older?' so many girls will say, 'Yes, I can't wait.'"" Kina says race, and racism, is front and centre of the problem. ""People will go, 'Oh, this part of your ethnic features? Ugly. But this part? I want this part so bad … Your nose is flat, that's gross; but your eyes, they're so pretty.'"" What do people of colour, who've often been racially vilified for their appearance, have to say about others cherry-picking their features? Dr Aquino describes this as a ""mixed race"" western beauty trend that privileges ""racial ambiguity"". ""All of a sudden, you're beautiful because you look ethnic, but not too ethnic',"" he says. ""There is a certain range where we find things to be acceptable."" Dr Goldman says there's a powerful marketing opportunity within that range. ""One of the things about the Kardashians and about racial ambiguity in general is that individuals have the ability to sit in the middle of this white and non-white [identity], reaping the benefits, while avoiding the costs."" Petronie has noticed an increase online in the presence of big hips, big lips and big bums in young women, including among white women. For her, it demonstrates an inescapable hypocrisy. ""I find it interesting because [white people] were teasing us before because Black people had big lips. ""And now that's what you want. ""When you're not Black and those are Black features — the lips and even the hair, like braids — it's cultural appropriation,"" she says. Petronie argues the act of assuming physical features or styles that are typical of a culture other than your own — full lips or full hips, or cornrows, for example — brings with it some responsibility. If you emulate Black culture, she says, ""then I want you to keep that same energy when it comes to issues that are happening within the Black community"". Stand with the Black Lives Matter movement, for example. ""Make sure that you're an ally. Don't just pick and choose what parts of our culture suit you, because Black culture is not a trend,"" Petronie says. Rokeshia Ashley, an assistant professor at Florida International University who specialises in body image and modification, wants to move on from talking about the Kardashians. She says plenty of Black women are now ""taking hold of this conversation"" and are ""also using their bodies as social capital"". She points to public figures such as model Blac Chyna, entrepreneur Jai Nice or influencer Eliza Reign as examples. Whether through modelling clothes or paid social media sponsorships, the women are creating revenue ""how they see fit"", she says. ""Although it may seem morally compromising to some, they are well within their right to govern their bodies autonomously."" Dr Ashley says rather than consider body modification — a term she uses to include cosmetic surgery as well as changes to hair or make-up — as inherently bad, we should be more ""receptive and supportive to what Black women want to do with their bodies"". Black women's bodies ""have always been governed"", whether by slavery or health institutions, or through other means, Dr Ashley says. ""Globally, with anti-Blackness, we didn't have the opportunity to be able to say, 'This is what I want to do with my body.'"" Whatever that choice is today, she supports it, so long as it can be done safely and with all the education and information at hand. Unlike some of her online critics, Natasha doesn't conflate her cosmetic procedures with her relationship to her cultural background. ""I'm very, very proud of being Middle Eastern,"" she says. And she's happy today with her slimmer nose and other cosmetic modifications, which she says have ""definitely made me more confident"". Petronie, on the other hand, decided against cosmetic surgery, and is also content with her decision. Her nose job idea was discouraged by her partner and, after considering it for a while, Petronie agreed she didn't need it. ""[I thought], you know what, I'm just going to embrace my culture [and] embrace my nose,"" she says. ""This is a Black person's nose. This is not every Black person's … but it's who I am. It's part of my history, my background. So I think I will be keeping it.""

1,COVID pandemic sees more people seeking help for opioid dependency linked to illegal Kamini herbal product,health,"  Shortage of illegal Kamini balls due to COVID pandemic sees more people seeking help for opioid dependency For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australia's coronavirus pandemic has revealed a little-known addiction to an illegally imported herbal product allegedly sold under the counter in some Asian grocery stores. COVID-19 lockdowns have resulted in supply shortages and price increases for Kamini balls, which derive their major constituent from the opium poppy. At least 12 people who had developed a dependence on Kamini balls sought help for withdrawal symptoms from four south-east Queensland opioid treatment clinics in the 18 months between January 2020 and June 2021. They complained to doctors of poor sleep, agitation, craving and inability to stop using the Indian herbal product. Brisbane addiction medicine specialist Jeremy Hayllar said he believed the problem was likely to be ""fairly widespread"", with other cases reported in Perth, Sydney and in Queensland's north. ""One patient commented that the retail outlet that he went to seemed to be doing very well, it was very prosperous, which suggests that there is a significant market, but it's all rather difficult to verify because what is happening is not legal,"" Dr Hayllar said. A study of the south-east Queensland cases, published in Drug and Alcohol Review, found the majority were men with a median age of 32, who had been using Kamini balls for between six months and eight years. They were in stable relationships and all but one were working. Eleven of them were migrants born in India. Seven of the 12 patients had worked in the ride-sharing industry. Although Kamini balls are an Ayurvedic medicine promoted to enhance sexual function, Dr Hayllar said patients had told him they had started using the herbal product after being advised it would give them ""more energy to enable them to work longer hours"". ""It's a real paradox because opioids tend to make you lazy and sleepy — they generally don't give you more energy,"" he said. One patient had started using Kamini balls for dental pain. Australia's medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has banned the importation and supply of Kamini balls. But patients have told addiction specialists the product was readily available and sold ""under the counter"" in Asian grocery stores and through online retailers. Dr Hayllar, clinical director of Metro North's Mental Health Alcohol and Drug Service based in Brisbane's inner-city, has been working in addiction medicine for 20 years, but had never previously treated a patient addicted to Kamini balls before the coronavirus pandemic hit. He said supply shortages of Kamini balls and corresponding price hikes during the pandemic had prompted users to seek help through public opioid treatment clinics. Writing in Drug and Alcohol Review, Queensland doctors said patients had told them prices had increased from $110 for a bottle of 40 Kamini balls to $180 a bottle during the COVID-19 pandemic. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. They said the patients were using between two and 30 Kamini balls a day, with a median use of 13 balls per day. ""I think corona really has something to do with the reason why patients have come forward for treatment — supply dried up with the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Dr Hayllar said. Dr Hayllar said all 12 patients had been successfully treated with medications to suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings. ""Treatment allows people to live healthy lives once more,"" he said.

2,Amrita's parents felt helpless as they watched her dying. Now there are calls for a policy overhaul,health,"  Calls for changes to Victorian hospital policies following death of 8yo Melbourne girl For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Calls are increasing for easier ways to request a second medical opinion in Victoria, following the death of an eight-year-old girl at Monash Children's Hospital in Melbourne last month. Amrita Lanka died 21 hours after being admitted to Monash Children's Hospital in April, with her parents claiming their concerns were ignored by the hospital. Monash Health said it had since contacted the family to offer support and that an investigation would be undertaken. In addition, the incident has been referred to Safer Care Victoria and the Coroner's court. Amrita's story has triggered new calls for change in the health system, with families now sharing their own experiences in the Victorian hospital system that mirror those of the Lanka family. When Keshanee De Silva brought her five-week-old son Azariah to Monash Children's Hospital last November, she had little idea of how traumatic the experience would be. Ms De Silva said she was initially told it was a dietary issue and was sent home, only to see her son's condition worsen. It took a 10-hour wait in the emergency department the next day before infant Ahmad was admitted to the children's ward. Ms De Silva said she was repeatedly told that her son was fine and would be able to go home, but her instincts told her something different. ""I kept saying to them 'he's not breathing properly … I can tell something's not right',"" she said. Ms De Silva said she was left without help for most of the day, and when ringing for assistance would be left waiting for half an hour at a time for anyone to arrive. She decided to seek a second opinion. ""I spent probably eight, nine hours that day telling nurses what my concerns were,"" she said. ""Eventually when I felt like I wasn't being heard, I took advantage of the internal avenue where you can call the number and let them know."" Do you know more about this story? Email vicindepth@abc.net.au. If you're sharing sensitive information, read our tips on how to contact us confidentially. After escalating the situation through a phone call asking for a second opinion, Ms De Silva said the hospital sent in a doctor who again dismissed her concerns. ""The doctor was patronising and using standard de-escalation language but was not actually listening to my concerns,"" Ms De Silva said. She said eventually a unit manager arrived who was more empathetic and understood her concerns. Azariah was discharged after his symptoms marginally improved, although Ms De Silva believes the hospital had little to do with his recovery. ""I could really relate to [Amrita's] mother's experience because of what we went through at the same hospital,"" Ms De Silva said. ""You sit there and think, 'that could have been us, that could have been anyone'."" Health bodies are now calling for patient escalation systems like the one Ms De Silva used at Monash Children's Hospital to be standardised and implemented at every hospital in the state. Australian Patients Association chief executive Stephen Mason said that patient escalation systems active interstate — where families can raise concerns if a patient's health condition is getting worse — are not as all-encompassing in Victoria. ""We know that in Queensland there’s such a system and I believe in WA there’s such a system, so I think after this tragedy it needs to be considered in Victoria,"" he said. In Queensland, the patient escalation procedure is known as Ryan's Rule, named after toddler Ryan Saunders who died in Rockhampton in 2011, with the coroner finding his death may have been prevented if he had been treated in a timely manner. In Western Australia last year, Aishwarya's Care was established following the death of a seven-year-old and subsequent inquiry into her treatment at Perth Children's Hospital. In Victoria, there is no blanket system for all hospitals like in other states. While an escalation pilot program was launched in 2019 by Safer Care Victoria called HEAR Me, patient escalation is still determined by individual hospital policy. Review launched into death of Amrita Lanka after parents claim their concerns were ignored In a statement, a Monash Health spokesperson defended its escalation policies, saying they were clearly accessible to all patients and families. ""Our patient escalation procedures are displayed visibly in all areas within our emergency departments, wards and website,"" a Monash Health spokesperson said. For families like the Lanka family who were interacting with hospital staff in their second language, there may be additional barriers to requesting a second opinion. The family said they were not aware that escalating their daughter's case was an option. Mr Mason said this was common in many of the stories he had heard. ""The main complaint is lack of communication,"" he said. ""When they feel totally neglected and don't know where to turn to or who to talk to, that's when they start to panic."" While other states were spurred by tragedies to enact changes in health policy, the Victorian government has still not committed to introducing a standardised escalation policy. ""Should Monash, Safer Care [Victoria] or indeed the Coroner's processes identify any areas where we can do better, then of course we would support that,"" Health Minister Martin Foley said. The Opposition has criticised the inaction, calling it another sign of a health system in crisis. ""The entire system is in crisis, it can't cope. This is a dire situation when you've got the tragic story of that little girl,"" Shadow Health Minister Georgie Crozier said. ""They've had no response from government, they've had no apology, they've had nothing."" Mr Mason said parents who experience the tragedy of losing a child are motivated not by a desire for compensation or revenge, but for positive change. ""They want to know what's gone wrong, they want transparency, they want to know the truth,"" Mr Mason said. ""They want to make sure it never happens to any other parent.""

3,"A question weighed heavily on Gabriel when he was 18. When asked, his doctor said he'd be blind by age 40",health,"  Gabriel will be blind by the time he's 40. But his vision for his community is 'crystal clear' For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency When Gabriel Gervasoni was born, he was so pale that the nuns at the old Catholic hospital in Ballarat thought ""he must be an angel"", his mother, Mandy, quips. ""He had this bright white hair,"" she says. ""People keep commenting, 'He's so alert, he's looking at everything'. I thought, 'his eyes are moving a lot', but I didn't have a lot of experience with babies."" Though hitting the expected milestones, as the weeks passed, Mandy began to notice that when Gabriel would look at people, ""he was really only looking at the direction the sound was coming from"". The doctor tried to reassure her. He's just maturing late, they told her. ""Some babies do that."" But Mandy ""had an instinct"". She was referred to a paediatrician for a second opinion — a decision that would herald a two-decade search for answers. ""I was given multiple diagnoses over the years, like Leber's congenital amaurosis, retinitis pigmentosa, albinism,"" says Gabriel, who is legally blind and has a reduced field of vision. ""It's stressful and frustrating not having answers."" Having spent much of his life in diagnostic purgatory, as Gabriel entered adulthood a question began to weigh on him. It was obvious that ""something was concerning him"", Mandy says, and when Gabriel was about 18 years old, he asked his childhood ophthalmologist point-blank: ""Am I going to go blind?"" ""He said, 'Yes, you'll be blind by the time you're 40',"" Gabriel says. It's a difficult prospect to contemplate, but a path the duo have navigated once before. After visiting the paediatrician all those years ago, Gabriel, still just a newborn, was referred to one of the top ophthalmologists in Victoria, who conducted a series of tests. ""They played lights, they're similar to strobe lights, as though you're in a nightclub,"" Mandy says. ""He didn't even wake up. He just sat there with his little head in the machine with me holding him up."" She was told that Gabriel had no light recognition, meaning he ""couldn't tell if it was light or dark"", and wouldn't be able to see But as he grew older, something happened: he started to gain limited vision. At six months, he turned his head towards a window, something he'd never done before. A year later, he started ""being really hesitant"". ""He'd be walking along, and then all of a sudden he'd go, 'Oh',"" Mandy says. ""He was actually getting his navigational vision, so he was actually being able to see blurry shapes, which was terrifying for him because he'd never experienced that before."" Though life through Gabriel's lens is ""very blurry"", his photo reel is a treasure trove of memories, and a celebration of the everyday. There's the duck he saw in the park one morning, and the ""huge cat"" that walked past him. ""It makes me realise how fleeting things are,"" he says of his journey. ""I want to memorise that while I've still got vision."" The official term for his ""current diagnosis"" is an ill-defined form of retinal dystrophy. In layman's terms, it means Gabriel's vision will ""gradually go away"" and he'll be ""completely blind"" by the time he's 40. But while Gabriel found himself in ""complete shock by the 180 (degree change)"" in his development, it would ultimately only further fuel his passion to help ""others with a disability to lead fulfilling lives"". If you are aged between 16 and 22 and would like to find out more about the ABC Heywire Competition, go to the ABC Heywire website. More than 575,000 Australians are blind or vision impaired. And as a young person with a disability, Gabriel knows all too well the extra hurdles employment, education and even social activities can bring. ""I realised when I was young, being vision impaired, I wouldn't have as many opportunities as someone with full vision,"" he says. ""So I decided that I'll do as much as I can to support the community and to raise awareness for people with vision impairment and disabilities in general."" Determined to be a voice for those often left out of the conversation, he joined the City of Ballarat's Youth Council and the Central Highlands Youth Advisory Board to ensure the needs of young people were being heard. ""He's become a fantastic role model for many of our other youth volunteers because nothing can stop him,"" says Katja Fiedler, a youth development officer with the City of Ballarat. ""On some of our leadership camps, we've gone out bush and done kayaking or we're jumping off things, and Gabe's always the first to put his hand up to do something he's never done before."" The youth council brings together young people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, experiences and abilities, who ""provide insights that we might not get from internal discussions or consultations within council"", Katja says. Through his lived experience, Gabriel has helped shape the city's health and wellbeing plan, and provided important input into local master plans and redevelopment projects. ""It's really, really important to get his insights as a young person who's visually impaired, especially when it comes to accessibility but also refurbishing,"" Katja says. ""What could or should a space look like to make it inclusive, accessible, enjoyable and accommodating for young people with vision impairment but also other disabilities?"" Accessibility challenges are often something people don't consider, echoes Mandy, who has seen Gabriel go through a ""really big orientation process"". His reduced field of vision means ""all of his peripheral vision is gone"" — something they ""couldn't plan for"". But for Mandy — who has watched her son not just adapt to life's challenges, but grow as a person — there was never any question over whether his diagnosis would quell his passion. ""We all have challenges to face and this was his challenge,"" she says. ""He's pretty exceptional. I know that every mother says that, but he really is,"" she laughs. Evidently, it's not just his mum who thinks so. Gabriel was named Ballarat's Young Citizen of the Year for 2021, with judges pointing to his ""determination to contribute to the Ballarat community"" and passion about ""issues affecting youth and those with disabilities"". While those living with a disability face barriers across the board, regional communities must navigate unique challenges, including significantly reduced access to options and choices about services to support their needs. Gabriel wants to use his platform to ensure decision-makers ""embrace accessibility as a priority and to ensure that there are no barriers to people with disability being part of our community"". ""Making sure people have access to employment, education, community spaces and social activities, that's very important to me,"" he says. It's a belief shared by Sally Aurisch, CEO of Blind Citizens Australia, the national representative organisation of people who are blind or vision impaired. While ""accessibility on a spectrum is not too bad"" in Australia, she says, ""we do still have our fair share of challenges"". ""A story I heard recently from someone was that they lived in a very small town with one bus driver, it was a very long trip, so it was hard to gauge, and that driver didn't mention to this person when their stop was approaching,"" she says. ""But this person never felt confident to provide feedback to this to the service provider because they were the only blind person in town, so it was going to be very easy to identify who they were."" It's why ensuring those who live with a disability have a seat at the table is so important, she says. ""I think that disability and life experience, in general, affects us all differently, our needs are quite unique and diverse,"" she says. ""And so by bringing together a variety of voices, when we design services and programs, we can make sure that they meet that diverse group of needs."" Soft-spoken and humble, Gabriel hesitates to speak about his achievements. Thankfully, that's what mums are for. ""We put in a cabinet to put his awards in and now he's taken up the whole thing,"" Mandy laughs. ""He can't win any more awards because I can't fit them in. ""He feels like it's a real honour, but he's embarrassed about it, because to him, it's just like, 'That's just what you do mum. If you see a need, you fill that need, you help that person'."" As she watches her son continue to ""exceed the expectations"", as he has in the face of all of life's hurdles, Mandy has high hopes for her regional community. She longs for the day when there are no barriers to employment, education and social activities; when Gabriel can be ""just another face in the crowd"". ""Without there needing to be special adaptations, because those adaptations are automatically built-in,"" she says. ""I just hope that he feels able to do whatever he wants to do; that whatever his dreams and his passion is in life, that he can do that."" As Gabriel's diagnosis stands, he has another 20 years of sight — and he's determined to make the most of it. You'll find the 21-year-old walking around town ""looking at everything"" in his path. ""People who can see might walk past certain things without really noticing it, because they've probably walked past it a million times and will pass it another million times,"" he says. ""But for me, I walk past it and I don't know if it's going to be the last time I see it or not. I want to imprint everything that I see so I can appreciate it."" The ABC's Heywire competition is open to all regional Australians aged between 16 and 22. The annual competition provides a platform for the younger generation, in pockets of Australia that rarely see the spotlight, to ""tell it like it is"".

4,One in three people are infected with this parasite – and the clue could be in your eyes,health,"  One in three people are infected with Toxoplasma parasite – and the clue could be in our eyes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Toxoplasma gondii is probably the most successful parasite in the world today. This microscopic creature is capable of infecting any mammal or bird, and people across all continents are infected. Once infected, a person carries Toxoplasma for life. So far, we don't have a drug that can eradicate the parasite from the body. And there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. Across the world, it's estimated 30–50 per cent of people are infected with Toxoplasma — and infections may be increasing in Australia. A survey of studies conducted at blood banks and pregnancy clinics across the country in the 1970s put the infection rate at 30 per cent. However, a recent Western Australian community-based study found 66 per cent of people were infected. The disease caused by this parasite can scar the back of the eye. Our new research looked for signs of disease in otherwise healthy people and found a significant number bore the mark of Toxoplasma. The cat is the primary host for Toxoplasma. Cats catch the parasite when they eat infected prey. Then, for a couple of weeks, they pass large numbers of parasites in their faeces in a form that can survive for long periods in the environment, even during extreme weather. When the faeces are ingested by livestock while grazing, parasites lodge in the muscle and survive there after the animals are slaughtered for meat. Humans can become infected by eating this meat, or by eating fresh produce or drinking water soiled by cats. It is also possible for a woman infected for the first time during pregnancy to pass the infection to her unborn child. While infection with Toxoplasma is extremely common, the most important health statistic is the rate of the disease caused by the infection, which is called toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma really likes the retina, the multi-layered nerve tissue that lines the eye and generates vision. Infection can cause recurring attacks of retinal inflammation and permanent retinal scarring. This is known as ocular toxoplasmosis. Contrary to much that is written about ocular toxoplasmosis, medical research shows this condition usually affects healthy adults. However, in aged persons or people with a weakened immune system, or when contracted during pregnancy, it can be more severe. An attack of active inflammation causes ""floaters"" and blurred vision. When the inflammation progresses to scarring, there may be permanent loss of vision. In a study of patients with ocular toxoplasmosis seen at a large ophthalmology clinic, we measured reduced vision to below driving level in more than 50 per cent of eyes, and 25 per cent of eyes were irreversibly blind. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are quite familiar with managing ocular toxoplasmosis. But the extent of the problem is not widely recognised, even by the medical community. The number of Australians with ocular toxoplasmosis had never been measured, until now. We wanted to investigate the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in Australia, but we knew it would be challenging to get funding for a major survey of this neglected disease. So, we used information collected for a different purpose: as part of the Busselton Healthy Ageing Study, retinal photographs were taken from more than 5,000 baby boomers (born 1946–64) living in Busselton, Western Australia. The photographs were gathered to look for other eye diseases, macular degeneration and glaucoma. By screening these retinal photographs, we estimated the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis at one in 150 Australians. This might seem surprisingly common, but it fits with the way people catch Toxoplasma. In addition to pet cats, Australia has huge populations of feral cats. And Australia is home to a lot of farmland, including over 50 per cent of the global organic farming area. Most importantly, many Australians like to eat their red meat rare, putting them at real risk. To diagnose ocular toxoplasmosis, a retina examination is necessary, ideally with the pupils dilated. The retinal lesion is easy to spot, because of the way Toxoplasma activates retinal cells to produce certain proteins, and an ophthalmologist or optometrist can immediately recognise the appearance. Often a blood test is also performed to make the diagnosis. If the condition is mild, the doctor may let the body's own immune system control the problem, which takes a few months. However, usually a combination of anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic drugs is prescribed. Toxoplasma infection is not curable, but it can be prevented. Meat sold in Australian supermarkets may harbour Toxoplasma. Cooking meat to an internal temperature of 66C or freezing it ahead of cooking are ways to kill the parasite. Fresh fruit and vegetables should be washed before eating, and drinking untreated water (such as straight from rivers or creeks) should be avoided. Gloves should be worn when changing cat litter, and hands washed afterwards. The World Health Organisation and other international and national health bodies are promoting an approach called One Health for diseases that cross humans, animals and their environments. This involves different sectors working together to promote good health. Now we know just how common ocular toxoplasmosis is in Australia, there is real justification to harness One Health to combat Toxoplasma infections in this country. Justine R.

Philip Reasbeck's resignation as the Mackay Hospital and Health Service's executive director of medical services was announced in an email to staff on Friday. In the email, Mackay HHS chief executive Lisa Davies Jones said a recruitment process would start soon for a replacement. It's the second resignation of a senior doctor at the hospital following their suspension pending the outcome of the review. Although Dr Reasbeck was not involved in the provision of obstetrics or gynaecological services at the hospital, as Mackay HHS's executive director of medical services, he was responsible for professional medical governance. Mackay Health Service's executive director of research and innovation, David Farlow, has been acting as executive director of medical services since Dr Reasbeck's suspension. Ms Davies Jones ordered the ongoing external review into maternity and gynaecological services at the hospital after being approached by patient advocate Beryl Crosby regarding concerns about complication rates. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists suspended the hospital's authorisation to train registrars in the specialty eight months ago, before the announcement of the review.

7,SA corrections department agrees to drop ban on political newspaper in prisons,health,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency South Australian prisoners will be allowed to receive a redacted version of a political newspaper ahead of the federal election, under an agreement reached with the Department for Correctional Services. The four-page ""Just Us"" newspaper contains information about prisoner rights and eligibility to vote, and articles outlining the policies of political parties. It has been produced by the Justice Action advocacy group since 2004 and is distributed to prisons across the country. But its circulation was this year barred in South Australia. Lawyers for Justice Action last week brought a legal challenge in an attempt to overturn the decision. The Supreme Court this morning heard the parties had reached an out-of-court agreement that will allow a redacted version of the publication to be distributed to prisoners. Prisoner advocate and Justice Action coordinator Brett Collins said the newspaper supported prisoners' democratic rights. ""This is the newspaper that allows people in prison to read about what the political parties have to say – it's as simple as that,"" he said. ""This newspaper had gone into every jurisdiction in Australia, except South Australia."" In SA, prisoners serving a sentence under three years are entitled to vote in elections. The Corrections Department did not provide reasons for the ban to the ABC last week, but in a letter published on the Justice Action website, the department's chief executive David Brown said the newsletter contained ""proactive and inflammatory material"". Mr Collins said there had been concerns about the inclusion of a motto ""Jailing is Failing"". ""The CEO said this would be likely to inflame or incite prisoners to cause unrest inside the jail,"" he said. ""That's absolutely ridiculous. ""We were shocked, really surprised and disappointed that the approach in South Australian corrections was so bad."" Mr Brown's letter also refers to material that aimed at ""facilitating relationships between prisoners and persons who are not prisoners, contrary to regulation 11(2)"". Mr Collins said contact details for political parties and other organisations, and some references to COVID-19, would also be removed from the publication. He said he believed contact details to be ""crucial"" to prisoners' participation in the election, but said the organisation decided to ""let it go"" because the ""paper is too important"". ""They've now guaranteed every prisoner in South Australia will get a copy of the paper and we're going to reprint the paper for them,"" Mr Collins said. In a statement, a Department for Correctional Services spokeswoman said: ""We are pleased we've been able to reach an outcome that reflects the department's commitment that only acceptable materials will be permitted to be distributed to prisoners. ""We remain committed to ensuring that all eligible prisoners are able to vote and have access to mandatory voting material for the upcoming election.""

8,"Perth public school reintroduces restrictions as state records third day of more than 15,000 COVID-19 cases",health,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Western Australia could see a COVID-19 caseload of up to 25,000 new infections a day in the coming weeks, the state's Chief Health Officer says. There were 15,565 new cases reported in Western Australia today, the third consecutive day there has been more than 15,000 new COVID-19 infections. Three more deaths have been reported, with 279 West Australians currently in hospital with the virus, 12 of whom are in intensive care, an increase of four from yesterday. Dr Andy Robertson told ABC Radio Perth the state could expect to see COVID-19 numbers rise in the coming week. ""We will continue to see rises over the next couple of weeks and we will probably get between [20,000] to 25,000 [cases] over the next couple of weeks,"" he said. ""We anticipate the numbers will then start to fall after that."" WA takes a giant step towards living with COVID-19, as a whole raft of restrictions are removed. Despite this, Dr Robertson said the timing was right to ease majority of COVID-19 restrictions, which had occurred in April, just days before the state recorded more than 10,000 cases for the first time. He said that lifting the mask mandate seemed appropriate, as data was proving the virus was spreading more in private gatherings. ""What we've seen is that, while all those measures had been very effective in suppressing the outbreak, we were starting to see spread largely being within family groups, within social groups."" Dr Robertson said he encouraged people to continue wearing masks if they felt it was necessary. ""We'd strongly encourage people to consider wearing masks, but they are having a lot less impact than they have had in the past,"" he said. While masks are no longer mandatory for most workers, the vaccine mandate is still in place, with 80.7 per cent of the eligible population having received their booster dose. Dr Robertson said the mandate would be reviewed in the coming weeks. ""[For] some groups — like those dealing with [the] vulnerable — we may want to maintain the mandates, while there may be other groups where those mandate aren't as critical going forward,"" he said. The current COVID-19 outbreak is placing a strain on all sectors, with at least one public school in Perth's western suburbs bringing back restrictions in an effort to stem the number of staff out of the classroom with the virus. The ABC understands parents with students at the school have been told by the principal that the lifting of government restrictions had significantly impacted the school's ability to function. It is understood that the school currently has about half a dozen staff members off work due to COVID-19 and, while that is a figure the school was able to handle for the moment, any more would make it difficult to manage. The restrictions the school was bringing back include cancelling assemblies and other large gatherings, no mixed classes, and limits on the number of students allowed for certain classes. Parents have been told those restrictions would remain in place for the rest of the semester. The Department of Education's director of schools, Bec Bope, said masks were no longer required but staff and students could continue wearing them if they wished. ""Parents and carers are allowed on education sites for outside school drop-off, face-to-face parent-teacher meetings, attending assemblies, volunteering outside of classrooms such as in the canteen and uniform shop, and visits to residential facilities,"" she said. ""Our expectation is that schools follow this health advice from the Chief Health Officer. ""If conditions do change, the Chief Health Officer will advise the department and we will notify schools of any adjustments that need to be made. ""I understand these are challenging times for our schools, but we ask that they contact the department should they require any support or advice.""

9,We asked for your election questions. Here's what kept coming up,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency We asked ABC readers what they wanted to know about the federal election and what matters to them. So far we've received more than 7,000 submissions on dozens of topics. Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions. But if you have more questions, you can submit them via the form at the bottom. You can cast your vote now at a pre-polling booth. Pre-polling booths are open at various locations around the country. You can also cast a postal vote. Postal votes must be received by the AEC by the 13th day after the election. You can cast your vote at a polling booth on Saturday, May 21 between 8am and 6pm (local time). You number the candidates on the ballot paper in order from your first choice (1) to your last. Preferential votes are counted until one candidate gets more than half of all the votes. If your first choice doesn't get enough votes, your vote may be reallocated to your second choice. Voting below the line for the Senate means your vote goes directly to an individual candidate, rather the candidates preferenced by political parties. If you vote below the line, you must number at least 12 boxes from 1 to 12. There has never been an ability to vote in an Australian federal election on the internet using a personal device. The results of three NSW local government elections that used online voting in December 2021 were ruled as being invalid after the system malfunctioned. You can see where the major parties stand on different issues here in this handy guide. It covers a range of key policy areas for the major parties: the Coalition (Liberals and Nationals), Labor and the Greens. The ""teal independents"" are not a political party. It's a label that's been given to a group of mostly female candidates taking on mostly male Liberal MPs in some of Australia's wealthiest electorates. You can read a full profile on each electorate and its candidates here. A ghost candidate is a term the ABC is using to describe someone who has been nominated as a candidate for a seat but who has not been seen or heard from by the constituents of that electorate. An ABC investigation has found ""ghost"" candidates are contesting seats in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. You can still vote for a candidate who has resigned or been disendorsed. There have been instances where disendorsed candidates have run as independents and won. The Coalition (the Liberals and Nationals) has committed to net zero emissions by 2050. They plan to get there by investing more than $20 billion in ""low emissions technologies"" in the next decade. Labor has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, along with a 2030 target of a 43 per cent cut in emissions. The party plans to upgrade the electricity grid, make electric vehicles cheaper, install community batteries and modernise steel and aluminium productions. The Greens want a 75 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 and want to hit net zero by 2035. The Greens want to phase out coal and gas completely and switch to 100 per cent renewable energy usage as soon as possible. The Coalition plans to work with the private sector to increase the uptake of EVs, hybrids and hydrogen powered vehicles, and will fund 50,000 new EV chargers. Labor wants to upgrade the electricity grid and introduce an electric car discount. The Greens are pushing for an ""electric vehicle revolution"" and plan for all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. The Reserve Bank of Australia sets interest rates. The government generally does not set, or put a cap on, interest rates. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has advocated for the minimum wage to be lifted 5.1 per cent in line with inflation, but has stopped short of saying he would formally submit that figure to the independent wage umpire. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says a 5 per cent increase could take a real toll on small businesses. The Coalition halved the fuel excise in the federal budget ahead of the election in late March. But it's only temporary with the cut due to expire at 11:59pm on September 28, 2022. Labor has not offered to extend the fuel excise cut past September. The Coalition has announced plans to expand its first home buyers and its Family Home Guarantee schemes. Labor is offering to help 10,000 households a year into home ownership as part of a ""shared-equity"" scheme and will also expand the first home buyers scheme. In shared equity schemes, the government covers part of the cost of a property, that can then be bought by the home owner over time. These types of schemes are already run in Victoria and Western Australia. The National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) makes rent more affordable for 22,000 properties nationwide. It is due to end in June 2026. There is no further or replacement government incentive, though rent can't be changed until end of the lease period. ABC's election analyst Antony Green does not believe the UAP will be in a position of power to push the policy as, at most, it could get one Senate seat this election. Neither major party likely to form government — the Liberal/National Coalition or Labor — has indicated any support for the idea of a mortgage cap. The budget forecast deficits around $80 billion this financial year and in 2022-23. Over the longer term, the budget forecasts deficits for at least the next decade. Net debt is set to peak at $864 billion in 2026, which is an improvement on a $1 trillion forecast in previous budgets. The Coalition government is keeping the permanent migration cap at 160,000 places for 2022-23 but will increase the proportion of visas dedicated to skilled migrants to about 70 per cent. Labor has indicated it will announce a policy before the election to make it easier for foreign workers to become permanent residents. The Bureau of Statistics uses a labour force framework to calculate the rates of unemployment and participation. You can see an example of how that's done here. October 2022. Liberal Prime Minister Scott Morrison has effectively ditched his commitment to establish a national anti-corruption watchdog. Labor says, if elected, it would create a National Anti-Corruption Commission by the end of the year. The Greens want to see an independent National Integrity Commission created. Several high-profile independents have campaigned on establishing a national corruption watchdog as a key election commitment. Donations worth less than $14,300 do not need to be declared, meaning smaller fundraising drives by political parties will often not be included in the disclosures. It is also possible for large donations to be made with multiple cheques just under that threshold. Money donated to political parties in the 11 months before the May election will not be made public until February 2023. The Liberals are promising to have staff spend at least three hours and 20 minutes per day with each aged care resident from next year. At least one nurse would have to be on shift, across a minimum of 16 hours per day. The Coalition government has not publicly backed a case in the Fair Work Commission to raise aged care workers' wages. Labor is promising to have a registered nurse on site at all times of the day. It would require staff to spend at least three hours and 35 minutes with each resident — in line with the aged care royal commission's recommendation. Labor also supports the push for an increase to workers' wages and will fully fund any increase. Party leader Anthony Albanese has admitted the party will need to recruit overseas health workers as a ""stopgap"" measure. Anne Ruston, who has been nominated as the next health minister if the Coalition wins the election, says they will not cut Medicare. Labor says its long-term goal is for dental services to be included in Medicare, but has not stipulated a time frame to achieve that. The Greens are the only party with elected representatives in parliament promising to introduce universal access to free dental care. Dental is not included in Medicare because it was considered too complex and too expensive to include in the scheme. The Coalition says it'll lower the cost of medicines on the PBS by $10, meaning the maximum cost will be $32.50. Labor's gone slightly further than the Coalition, promising to lower the cost of medicines by $12.50 to a maximum cost of $30.

10,COVID pandemic sees more people seeking help for opioid dependency linked to illegal Kamini herbal product,health,"  Shortage of illegal Kamini balls due to COVID pandemic sees more people seeking help for opioid dependency For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Australia's coronavirus pandemic has revealed a little-known addiction to an illegally imported herbal product allegedly sold under the counter in some Asian grocery stores. COVID-19 lockdowns have resulted in supply shortages and price increases for Kamini balls, which derive their major constituent from the opium poppy. At least 12 people who had developed a dependence on Kamini balls sought help for withdrawal symptoms from four south-east Queensland opioid treatment clinics in the 18 months between January 2020 and June 2021. They complained to doctors of poor sleep, agitation, craving and inability to stop using the Indian herbal product. Brisbane addiction medicine specialist Jeremy Hayllar said he believed the problem was likely to be ""fairly widespread"", with other cases reported in Perth, Sydney and in Queensland's north. ""One patient commented that the retail outlet that he went to seemed to be doing very well, it was very prosperous, which suggests that there is a significant market, but it's all rather difficult to verify because what is happening is not legal,"" Dr Hayllar said. A study of the south-east Queensland cases, published in Drug and Alcohol Review, found the majority were men with a median age of 32, who had been using Kamini balls for between six months and eight years. They were in stable relationships and all but one were working. Eleven of them were migrants born in India. Seven of the 12 patients had worked in the ride-sharing industry. Although Kamini balls are an Ayurvedic medicine promoted to enhance sexual function, Dr Hayllar said patients had told him they had started using the herbal product after being advised it would give them ""more energy to enable them to work longer hours"". ""It's a real paradox because opioids tend to make you lazy and sleepy — they generally don't give you more energy,"" he said. One patient had started using Kamini balls for dental pain. Australia's medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has banned the importation and supply of Kamini balls. But patients have told addiction specialists the product was readily available and sold ""under the counter"" in Asian grocery stores and through online retailers. Dr Hayllar, clinical director of Metro North's Mental Health Alcohol and Drug Service based in Brisbane's inner-city, has been working in addiction medicine for 20 years, but had never previously treated a patient addicted to Kamini balls before the coronavirus pandemic hit. He said supply shortages of Kamini balls and corresponding price hikes during the pandemic had prompted users to seek help through public opioid treatment clinics. Writing in Drug and Alcohol Review, Queensland doctors said patients had told them prices had increased from $110 for a bottle of 40 Kamini balls to $180 a bottle during the COVID-19 pandemic. We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. They said the patients were using between two and 30 Kamini balls a day, with a median use of 13 balls per day. ""I think corona really has something to do with the reason why patients have come forward for treatment — supply dried up with the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Dr Hayllar said. Dr Hayllar said all 12 patients had been successfully treated with medications to suppress opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings. ""Treatment allows people to live healthy lives once more,"" he said.

11,Amrita's parents felt helpless as they watched her dying. Now there are calls for a policy overhaul,health,"  Calls for changes to Victorian hospital policies following death of 8yo Melbourne girl For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Calls are increasing for easier ways to request a second medical opinion in Victoria, following the death of an eight-year-old girl at Monash Children's Hospital in Melbourne last month. Amrita Lanka died 21 hours after being admitted to Monash Children's Hospital in April, with her parents claiming their concerns were ignored by the hospital. Monash Health said it had since contacted the family to offer support and that an investigation would be undertaken. In addition, the incident has been referred to Safer Care Victoria and the Coroner's court. Amrita's story has triggered new calls for change in the health system, with families now sharing their own experiences in the Victorian hospital system that mirror those of the Lanka family. When Keshanee De Silva brought her five-week-old son Azariah to Monash Children's Hospital last November, she had little idea of how traumatic the experience would be. Ms De Silva said she was initially told it was a dietary issue and was sent home, only to see her son's condition worsen. It took a 10-hour wait in the emergency department the next day before infant Ahmad was admitted to the children's ward. Ms De Silva said she was repeatedly told that her son was fine and would be able to go home, but her instincts told her something different. ""I kept saying to them 'he's not breathing properly … I can tell something's not right',"" she said. Ms De Silva said she was left without help for most of the day, and when ringing for assistance would be left waiting for half an hour at a time for anyone to arrive. She decided to seek a second opinion. ""I spent probably eight, nine hours that day telling nurses what my concerns were,"" she said. ""Eventually when I felt like I wasn't being heard, I took advantage of the internal avenue where you can call the number and let them know."" Do you know more about this story? Email vicindepth@abc.net.au. If you're sharing sensitive information, read our tips on how to contact us confidentially. After escalating the situation through a phone call asking for a second opinion, Ms De Silva said the hospital sent in a doctor who again dismissed her concerns. ""The doctor was patronising and using standard de-escalation language but was not actually listening to my concerns,"" Ms De Silva said. She said eventually a unit manager arrived who was more empathetic and understood her concerns. Azariah was discharged after his symptoms marginally improved, although Ms De Silva believes the hospital had little to do with his recovery. ""I could really relate to [Amrita's] mother's experience because of what we went through at the same hospital,"" Ms De Silva said. ""You sit there and think, 'that could have been us, that could have been anyone'."" Health bodies are now calling for patient escalation systems like the one Ms De Silva used at Monash Children's Hospital to be standardised and implemented at every hospital in the state. Australian Patients Association chief executive Stephen Mason said that patient escalation systems active interstate — where families can raise concerns if a patient's health condition is getting worse — are not as all-encompassing in Victoria. ""We know that in Queensland there’s such a system and I believe in WA there’s such a system, so I think after this tragedy it needs to be considered in Victoria,"" he said. In Queensland, the patient escalation procedure is known as Ryan's Rule, named after toddler Ryan Saunders who died in Rockhampton in 2011, with the coroner finding his death may have been prevented if he had been treated in a timely manner. In Western Australia last year, Aishwarya's Care was established following the death of a seven-year-old and subsequent inquiry into her treatment at Perth Children's Hospital. In Victoria, there is no blanket system for all hospitals like in other states. While an escalation pilot program was launched in 2019 by Safer Care Victoria called HEAR Me, patient escalation is still determined by individual hospital policy. Review launched into death of Amrita Lanka after parents claim their concerns were ignored In a statement, a Monash Health spokesperson defended its escalation policies, saying they were clearly accessible to all patients and families. ""Our patient escalation procedures are displayed visibly in all areas within our emergency departments, wards and website,"" a Monash Health spokesperson said. For families like the Lanka family who were interacting with hospital staff in their second language, there may be additional barriers to requesting a second opinion. The family said they were not aware that escalating their daughter's case was an option. Mr Mason said this was common in many of the stories he had heard. ""The main complaint is lack of communication,"" he said. ""When they feel totally neglected and don't know where to turn to or who to talk to, that's when they start to panic."" While other states were spurred by tragedies to enact changes in health policy, the Victorian government has still not committed to introducing a standardised escalation policy. ""Should Monash, Safer Care [Victoria] or indeed the Coroner's processes identify any areas where we can do better, then of course we would support that,"" Health Minister Martin Foley said. The Opposition has criticised the inaction, calling it another sign of a health system in crisis. ""The entire system is in crisis, it can't cope. This is a dire situation when you've got the tragic story of that little girl,"" Shadow Health Minister Georgie Crozier said. ""They've had no response from government, they've had no apology, they've had nothing."" Mr Mason said parents who experience the tragedy of losing a child are motivated not by a desire for compensation or revenge, but for positive change. ""They want to know what's gone wrong, they want transparency, they want to know the truth,"" Mr Mason said. ""They want to make sure it never happens to any other parent.""

12,Keeping up with the Kardashians: Women turning to cosmetic surgery to be 'ethnic but not too ethnic',health,"  Why new cosmetic surgery trends that 'pick and choose' from cultures raise cultural appropriation concerns For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Who wins and who loses when beauty trends celebrate cosmetically altered looks that are ethnic — but 'not too ethnic'? Growing up in Sydney, Petronie was taught to be proud of her Blackness. The message was instilled in her by her mum and dad, who are from Zambia and the Republic of the Congo, respectively. ""They were always telling me that I'm Black and I'm beautiful, and just making sure I really believed that,"" Petronie says. Though it was powerful, it still couldn't shield the 26-year-old model and influencer from pervasive western beauty norms. In 2007, when US reality TV stars the Kardashians shot to fame, Petronie was one of the millions of people around the world who began noticing physical alterations in the sisters. In particular, she watched Kim Kardashian's ""nose changes over time"". And whenever Petronie used social media filters — which tweak facial features, often for comedic or beautifying effect — she noticed that some shrank the size of her nose. By the time she was 21, Petronie decided she wanted cosmetic surgery, too. ""I wanted my nose to be a bit thinner and pushed up,"" she says. But Petronie is acutely aware that while cosmetic surgery can erase some features like a non-Caucasian nose, it can also emphasise others, like big lips or almond-shaped eyes. That cosmetic procedures allow people to capitalise on the desirability of those cultural features — while removing others — is a pop culture paradox, and it's impacting the steadily growing number of Australians who are opting for cosmetic procedures. Many are weighing up the relationship between their culture and their appearance, in the face of trends that promote a look of ethnic — but, some argue, ""not too ethnic"" — ambiguity. Adria Goldman is assistant professor of communication and digital studies at the University of Mary Washington in the US. She says the term ""Blackfishing"" describes ""an act of cultural appropriation where someone non-Black tries to present themselves as Black"". That could be through darkening their skin, adopting an Afro-centric hairstyle, or getting a more voluptuous shape, through photo editing or even butt augmentation. ""Oftentimes [it's] for profit or some other personal gain,"" she says. Blackfishing is a criticism that's been levelled at the Kardashians, and other celebrities including Australian singer Iggy Azalea, British singer Rita Ora and American singer Ariana Grande. Some accused of Blackfishing or of cultural appropriation have counter argued that in fact they are enacting cultural ""appreciation"", Dr Goldman says. But, she argues, while intent is worth considering, ultimately it's not the point. ""A person can appropriate Black culture and say that their intention was not to do harm — but appropriating Black culture does do harm,"" she says. It can reinforce ""surface level"" or ""misinformed"" ideas about Black culture. ""It's commodifying this culture with no gain to Black people."" Like Petronie, social media consultant Natasha also watched the Kardashians' appearances morph over time. Natasha is Middle Eastern-Australian and was very insecure about her appearance when she was growing up. ""I never felt like I was the pretty girl, ever. And I think that was because … I was around mostly white people,"" she says. By the end of high school, she had endured years of teasing about her looks. Yet, at the same time, reality TV was demonstrating that appearance isn't fixed. ""I started realising, oh wow, things can be changed,"" Natasha says. So at 18 years of age, Natasha, who is now 26, began cosmetic enhancement — first lip filler, then rhinoplasty or a nose job — to alter what she calls her ""ethnic nose"". But she says that modifying her cultural features has come at a cost. While she publicly, and proudly, identifies as a woman of colour, she says she's been criticised online for having ""absolutely no features that correlate with a woman of colour"" and for being ""white passing"". For Natasha, such statements diminish her personal experience. ""They don't know the torment I went through growing up,"" she says. ""I start to think it's my fault because I've changed my ethnic features. ""But it's so wrong."" Natasha says the comments also diminish the discrimination faced by her Aramaean forebears. ""My people have gone through so much persecution … and even my parents, moving to Australia [have endured] so much hardship,"" she says. The criticism levelled at those who undergo cosmetic surgery to modify their cultural features is one that philosopher and physician Yves Saint James Aquino is familiar with. He has studied the ethics of cosmetic enhancement, specifically blepharoplasty or double eyelid surgery, a procedure that is most popular in South East Asia. Dr Aquino, who is also a research fellow with the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, says people who undergo this surgery are often criticised for ""betraying their heritage"" or being ""a race traitor"". He argues it's a reductive position to take. ""Heritage and culture is more than appearance,"" he says. Dr Aquino believes that people, women specifically, ""should be able to do whatever they want with their body"". But he also believes that ""choice"" to undergo body or face modification is a concept that ""we have to interrogate"" in the context of media, peer group and broader societal pressure. ""Even if no one's pointing a gun at your head, you live through all these pressures, all these directives … [so] is that an authentic choice?"" One of those pressures is social media. Dr Aquino knows of cosmetic surgeons who report that their clients want ""to change their face based on specific [social media] filters"". He says other clients want to alter their noses because the angle of a selfie gives the illusion of an increased nose size. ""So it's a very weird, perceptual thing that's influencing their self-image … it's the way they hold their phone,"" he says. The cosmetic enhancement industry in Australia is booming. We meet the people chasing their aesthetic ideal and those jumping off the cosmetic enhancement conveyor belt. Gemma Sharp has also noticed shifts in cosmetic surgery requests. A clinical psychologist and Senior Research Fellow in the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre, Dr Sharp leads the Body Image Research Group. She says there's been a move away from a ""traditional facelift, which is used to 'rectify' ageing processes"". Rather, ""preventative"" procedures such as fillers are becoming more common among younger people. Dr Sharp says the expansion of the sorts of people having procedures is thanks to reduced costs, increased availability and the normalisation of cosmetic surgery through the media. ""People who tended to seek cosmetic procedures were more likely aged 30 and over in the past, but now we are seeing people seeking them as young as late teens and 20s."" In the last five years or so, there's been a sharp increase in the use of injectables (such as in wrinkle-reducing or lip-filling procedures) in Australia, and the Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) operation, which ""is the fastest growing cosmetic surgery in the world"", Dr Sharp says. At 2018, Australians were spending more per capita on cosmetic surgery than in the US, with anti-wrinkle (Botox) injections the most popular operation at the time. Cosmetic surgery wasn't on the mind of 14-year-old Kina when she started posting selfies on social media. For a long time, Kina, who has Indian heritage, only posted photos with filters applied to them. At first, the filters were ""cute hearts"" or ""a nice background"", she says. ""And I was like, that's lovely."" Then she realised the filters could also ""slim down my nose … make my nose look upturned … make my lips and eyes bigger [and] my face slimmer"" and ""significantly lighten my skin"". ""I looked like a white person,"" Kina says. It began to change the way she thought about herself. ""I was just like, am I not pretty otherwise? It came to the point where I could not take a photo without a filter because I would look at myself and find all these little faults."" Kina started to ask herself, ""Why can't my nose be slimmer? Why can't my lips be bigger? Why can't my face have more of a structure to it instead of being so round?"" She recognised the filters' ""toxic"" influence and today she tries to avoid them. But she's concerned that she and her peers are bombarded on social media with ideals about an ""unattainable body"". ""[The beauty ideal] is very much centred around white women having racially ambiguous features, like those big lips, the very Middle Eastern and South Asian brows and eyes, and Black bodies,"" Kina says. ""It's just very unsustainable because nobody actually looks like that."" And it sends a powerful message of inadequacy to teenagers online. ""If I went and asked younger girls around my age, 'Do you have insecurities? Do you hate anything about yourself?', so many girls will be like, 'I hate my body, I hate my face [or] how my lips look or [how] my eyes look,'"" Kina says. ""If you ask them, 'Do you want to get surgeries when you're older?' so many girls will say, 'Yes, I can't wait.'"" Kina says race, and racism, is front and centre of the problem. ""People will go, 'Oh, this part of your ethnic features? Ugly. But this part? I want this part so bad … Your nose is flat, that's gross; but your eyes, they're so pretty.'"" What do people of colour, who've often been racially vilified for their appearance, have to say about others cherry-picking their features? Dr Aquino describes this as a ""mixed race"" western beauty trend that privileges ""racial ambiguity"". ""All of a sudden, you're beautiful because you look ethnic, but not too ethnic',"" he says. ""There is a certain range where we find things to be acceptable."" Dr Goldman says there's a powerful marketing opportunity within that range. ""One of the things about the Kardashians and about racial ambiguity in general is that individuals have the ability to sit in the middle of this white and non-white [identity], reaping the benefits, while avoiding the costs."" Petronie has noticed an increase online in the presence of big hips, big lips and big bums in young women, including among white women. For her, it demonstrates an inescapable hypocrisy. ""I find it interesting because [white people] were teasing us before because Black people had big lips. ""And now that's what you want. ""When you're not Black and those are Black features — the lips and even the hair, like braids — it's cultural appropriation,"" she says. Petronie argues the act of assuming physical features or styles that are typical of a culture other than your own — full lips or full hips, or cornrows, for example — brings with it some responsibility. If you emulate Black culture, she says, ""then I want you to keep that same energy when it comes to issues that are happening within the Black community"". Stand with the Black Lives Matter movement, for example. ""Make sure that you're an ally. Don't just pick and choose what parts of our culture suit you, because Black culture is not a trend,"" Petronie says. Rokeshia Ashley, an assistant professor at Florida International University who specialises in body image and modification, wants to move on from talking about the Kardashians. She says plenty of Black women are now ""taking hold of this conversation"" and are ""also using their bodies as social capital"". She points to public figures such as model Blac Chyna, entrepreneur Jai Nice or influencer Eliza Reign as examples. Whether through modelling clothes or paid social media sponsorships, the women are creating revenue ""how they see fit"", she says. ""Although it may seem morally compromising to some, they are well within their right to govern their bodies autonomously."" Dr Ashley says rather than consider body modification — a term she uses to include cosmetic surgery as well as changes to hair or make-up — as inherently bad, we should be more ""receptive and supportive to what Black women want to do with their bodies"". Black women's bodies ""have always been governed"", whether by slavery or health institutions, or through other means, Dr Ashley says. ""Globally, with anti-Blackness, we didn't have the opportunity to be able to say, 'This is what I want to do with my body.'"" Whatever that choice is today, she supports it, so long as it can be done safely and with all the education and information at hand. Unlike some of her online critics, Natasha doesn't conflate her cosmetic procedures with her relationship to her cultural background. ""I'm very, very proud of being Middle Eastern,"" she says. And she's happy today with her slimmer nose and other cosmetic modifications, which she says have ""definitely made me more confident"". Petronie, on the other hand, decided against cosmetic surgery, and is also content with her decision. Her nose job idea was discouraged by her partner and, after considering it for a while, Petronie agreed she didn't need it. ""[I thought], you know what, I'm just going to embrace my culture [and] embrace my nose,"" she says. ""This is a Black person's nose. This is not every Black person's … but it's who I am. It's part of my history, my background. So I think I will be keeping it.""

13,'A tragic milestone': United States records 1 million deaths from COVID-19,health,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency The United States has recorded more than 1 million COVID-19 deaths, the White House says, with the country reaching a once-unthinkable milestone two years after the first cases up-ended everyday life. In a statement, US President Joe Biden said it marked a ""tragic milestone"" for the country that has recorded the most COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began. ""One million empty chairs around the dinner table. Each an irreplaceable loss. Each leaving behind a family, a community, and a nation forever changed because of this pandemic,"" he said. ""As a nation, we must not grow numb to such sorrow. ""We must remain vigilant against this pandemic and do everything we can to save as many lives as possible, as we have with more testing, vaccines, and treatments than ever before."" The 1 million mark represents roughly one death for every 327 Americans, or more than the entire population of San Francisco or Seattle. By the time the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had claimed 36 lives in the United States. By June 2020, the US death toll had surpassed the total of the country's military deaths in World War I and it would exceed the American military losses of War World II by January 2021 when more than 405,000 deaths were recorded. The disease has left few places on Earth untouched, with 6.7 million confirmed deaths globally. Last week, the WHO said nearly 15 million people were killed either by COVID-19 or by its impact on overwhelmed health systems during the past two years. The estimation is more than double the official death toll of just over 5.4 million. Millions of Americans eagerly rolled up their sleeves to receive COVID vaccines after distribution began in late 2020. By early 2021, the virus had already claimed a staggering 500,000 lives. At one point in January of that year, more people died from COVID-19 every day on average than were killed in the September 11 attacks in 2001. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers say three out of every four US children have been infected with the coronavirus and more than half of all Americans have signs of previous infections. COVID-19 preyed on the elderly and those with compromised health, but it also targeted young people, killing more than 1,000 children. Researchers estimate 213,000 US children lost at least one parent or primary caregiver during the pandemic, taking an immeasurable emotional toll. With the COVID-19 threat subsiding after the Omicron wave last winter, many Americans have shed masks and returned to offices in recent weeks. Restaurants and bars are once again teeming with patrons, and the public's attention has shifted to inflation and economic concerns. But researchers are already working on yet another booster shot as the virus continues to mutate. ""By no means is it over,"" said top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci at a recent event. ""We still are experiencing a global pandemic.""

14,"Cost of living relief centrepiece of WA budget, but no wage increase for public sector workers",health,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Premier Mark McGowan's second budget as Treasurer has delivered another significant surplus and some relief for households, but few surprises. After a record-high $5.8 billion surplus in last year's budget, this year's budget delivers a slightly reduced surplus of $5.7 billion. Like previous years, that's largely because of increases in mining royalties, increased taxes and the state receiving more GST money than expected. ""This is another strong budget that helps set Western Australia up for a bright future beyond the pandemic,"" Mr McGowan said. The most significant measure announced today was a $400 electricity credit for every household, which will cost the state $455 million in total. Other cost of living support will largely come through household fees and charges increasing by less than the state's predicted inflation rate. Support for the state's ailing health system remains below what many in the sector would have liked to see. The budget contains a total of $2.5 billion for health, including an extra $629 million to fund services over the next year – a 12 per cent increase to what had been estimated in last year’s budget. Almost everything else for the sector had already been announced, including $223.4 million in new money for infrastructure and a similar amount to reduce pressure on emergency departments. The Premier said his government was doing everything it could to help the system, but there was little hope of short-term relief. How will you benefit from the WA government's huge budget surplus? And who will miss out? Find out with our handy guide. ""What we're doing is using our strong financial position to invest heavily in the health system and make sure we can deal with the demand as it arises,"" he said. ""There's no overnight fixes here because of the COVID environment we're in. ""But we're certainly leaving no stone unturned in terms of new initiatives we're putting in place and the new investment we're putting in place."" While inflation jumped 7.6 per cent in Perth at the last estimate, the Premier was confident it would settle at around 4 per cent across the current financial year, falling to 2.75 per cent next year. A raft of household fees and charges will increase from July 1, including electricity (up 2.5 per cent), water (up 2.5 per cent), vehicle licence (up 3.8 per cent), drivers licence (up 6.4 per cent) and the emergency services levy (up 5 per cent). However, Mr McGowan said fees and charges would drop by 3.8 per cent when the electricity credit is taken into account, delivering a saving of $244 for households. Concession card holders will get $718 towards their electricity bills because they will be eligible for the one-off payment of $400 as well as the $318 energy assistance payments. ""We don't have to borrow the money to do it either, as other governments have. It's funded from our strong surplus,"" he said. ""At a time of real pressure at the bowser and at the check-out, my WA Labor government is delivering real relief to Western Australians right across the state."" While another strong surplus has been forecast this year, next year's is expected to be much smaller at $1.6 billion. Aiding those figures will be climbing GST revenue over the years ahead, from $5.9 billion this year to $7.4 billion in 2025-26. This year's surplus had also been estimated at far below what has been delivered, which Mr McGowan put down to conservative iron ore price expectations. ""Iron ore prices have gone up, our revenue's increased because of the booming property market and booming employment market in Western Australia,"" he said. And while net government debt is forecast to fall to $29.9 billion this year, it's expected to rise to $31 billion next year and $34 billion in 2025-26. The state's economy is estimated to have grown by 5.25 per cent in the current financial year, before slowing to 4 per cent growth next year and continuing to fall until 2024-25. Those figures are a result of West Australians being largely locked in the state for the last two years, delivering a boost, before spending returns to more normal levels over the years ahead. One of the few new announcements in today's budget was significant changes to try to stimulate growth in parts of WA's housing sector. Starting mid next year, the government will offer a 50 per cent land tax concession for some build-to-rent developments. That is hoped to increase rental stocks in the state, and is similar to schemes used in other states. It will also be cheaper to purchase off-the-plan apartments worth less than $500,000, with purchasers to receive a rebate equivalent to what they pay in stamp duty. Mr McGowan continued to celebrate what he framed as his government's successes in managing the state's finances, while taking aim at other leaders around the country. ""I suspect they'll be green with envy. Some of them will look like they've swallowed a bumble bee,"" he said. ""All the other states have not run their finances as well as Western Australia. ""That's the reality, and so they need to cut their cloth to meet their circumstances. That's what we did when we came to office."" He also spoke of WA's contributions to the national economy, particularly over the last two years. Western Australia's reliance on China remains the cornerstone of the state's riches. Other commitments in this year's budget are $1.3 billion to try and diversify the state's economy, including money to attract international industries and students, as well as tourism marketing. A total of $650 million will be spent on climate action, which includes a rebate on electric cars announced earlier this week. Almost $33.9 billion will be spent on infrastructure projects in the coming years, including $12 billion in regional areas. Mr McGowan acknowledged many projects would be affected by cost increases, but could not point to any specific blowouts. He said $350 million had been allocated to absorb those increases. A number of Metronet projects are expected to be delayed, with budget papers revealing the State and Commonwealth governments would spend an extra $379.5 million over the coming years on the Thornlie-Cockburn and Yanchep lines. While the $400 electricity credit has been welcomed by welfare groups, the Western Australian Council of Social Service (WACOSS) said a more targeted approach was needed for vulnerable households. ""That $400 won't go very far because we're talking about 12 per cent increases in rental prices, we've got a 7.6 per cent increase in inflation, we've got real stagnation in wages,"" WACOSS CEO Louise Giolitto said. Treasury forecasts the soaring cost of living will cool off in the coming years, however, public-sector unions believe the budget should have included a wage increase. Despite rising inflation, no improvements were made to the pay rise announced in December of a 2.5 per cent increase, plus the option of another 0.25 per cent or one-off $1000 payment. ""This is a budget that fails public sector workers,"" said Unions WA secretary Owen Whittle. ""The state government needs to review the [wages] policy and they need to come to the table with at least a 4 or 5 per cent pay rise for public sector workers, if not far more to keep up with the increasing cost of living."" The comments were mirrored by the United Workers Union. Welfare groups say promises made in the campaign amount to ""window dressing"" for those living in poverty. ""This budget is a kick in the guts for workers, who next week are going to have to try and work out how they're going to pay bills and how they're going to put food on the table,"" public sector coordinator Kevin Sneddon said. ""I have members who are one pay packet away from sleeping in a car ... that's how close they are to poverty at the moment,"" he said. WA's Health Services Union and the WA Police Union have also demanded better pay conditions to attract more workers. Opposition leader Mia Davies questioned how WA could be the wealthiest state in the nation while also having a ""crumbling health system, a housing crisis and more and more West Australian households struggling to make ends meet"". Ms Davies said the benefit of the power credit was cancelled out by rising water charges (up 2.5 per cent), vehicle license (up 3.8 per cent), drivers license (up 6.4 per cent) and public transport fees (up 2 per cent). The emergency services levy will also rise by five per cent. ""This Premier doesn't get gold stars for economic management as much as he likes to pat himself on the back,"" she said. ""You can't deliver multi-billion dollar surpluses two years in a row and not share the wealth of the nation with families and households that are struggling to make ends meet."" Meanwhile, the state's business lobby congratulated the state government for holding firm on its wages policy and said it delivered a ""good budget"". ""We're now getting below $30 billion in net debt ... that's critical for the future of the state's finances,"" said Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief economist Aaron Morey. However, while Mr Morey said the measures to lower the tax burden on WA businesses was welcomed, he felt more could be done. ""Now businesses can pay their payroll tax quarterly instead of monthly [and] that does reduce that admin burden,"" he said. But in terms of that overall amount of tax paid, there is much more the government can do.""

15,Are you a winner or a loser in Mark McGowan's 2022 Budget?,health,"  WA Budget 2022: Winners and Losers For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency With its huge $5.7 billion surplus — though slightly less than last year's $5.8bn — the 2022 WA budget offers a plethora of riches for the state. But what's really in it for you, and who will benefit the most? A $5.7 billion surplus means there's a lot of money in the coffers and a renewed imperative to spend it wisely. The windfall comes courtesy of surging commodity prices, primarily from iron ore, and despite a global pandemic that has seen other economies struggle. It dwarfs the government's own estimate of a $2.4 billion surplus just five months ago in the mid-year economic review, but comes in well below the $8 billion estimated by ratings agency Standard and Poor two months ago. Next year's surplus is projected to be a more modest $1.6 billion, with the iron ore price expected to drop to $US75 a tonne. Last year's budget estimated prices as high as $US121 a tonne, and in recent months it has climbed well beyond that. However, the more conservative estimate going forward is a reflection of ongoing global volatility. While the government claims the surplus is the result of prudent economic management, the Opposition is demanding to know why the health system is in crisis, given the riches the state is awash with. It also thinks state debt should be addressed. Net debt remains high, at $29.9 billion, and is set to increase in coming years, rising to $34 billion by 2025-26. The crisis in the health system was laid bare this week when ambulance ramping figures skyrocketed — and the government is hoping $252 million in new funding will help alleviate some of the problems. The money is earmarked for 17 projects which the government hopes will free up hospital beds and ensure people get better healthcare when they most need it. These include more aged care beds, emergency department nurses, and an expansion of telehealth services. There's also an extra $181 million for mental health and drug and alcohol services. Separately, the budget also contains $1.3 billion in COVID-specific health measures, including the provision of more free rapid antigen tests. Mental health funding gets a $181 million boost, including funding for drug and alcohol services. There are more staff for the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, and a virtual support service for at-risk children. However, cost blowouts and delays have impacted the Karratha and Broome step-up, step-down facilities, which will now cost an extra $3.9 million. Planning to buy an electric car? The WA Government will rebate you up to $3,500 if you buy one for less than $70,000 as part of a $60 million package to accelerate the use of zero-emission vehicles There's also money to upgrade the state's charging station infrastructure. But it's not all good news if you're an EV driver. There's also a new per-kilometre tax being introduced for EVs to help pay for road maintenance, currently set at 2.5 cents per kilometre but pegged to rise with inflation. WA residents will get $400 off their electricity bills in a one-off measure to help with the escalating cost of living that the government says will see the average household get three months of free electricity. With inflation running at 5.1 per cent, it's clear many West Australians are struggling, despite the state's strong economic position. But it's not all good news for bill payers, with other household charges set to rise 2.5 per cent, including a two per cent rise in public transport fares. This is higher than the 1.75 per cent rise forecast in last year's budget. But taking into account the one-off payment, Mr McGowan says householders will actually see fees and charges decrease 3.8 per cent overall. Among the rise in household fees and charges is a significant hike in driver's licence fees, up 6.4 per cent.to $93.70. It'll cost you more to license your car too, with vehicle licensing up 3.8 per cent, to $414.92 on average. And if you think you can avoid the price hikes by taking public transport, think again. Fares are up two per cent, though student fares have not changed. With WA's borders largely closed for two years, and many tourism operators brought to their knees, the government is keen to throw out the welcome mat to visitors in a big way. There's a $21 million marketing budget to attract interstate and international visitors, as well as $31 million for major events. There's $19.3 million to entice people to view next year's total solar eclipse from WA, best viewed from Exmouth, with a major event planned for the region. And one of Fremantle's major drawcards, its World Heritage-listed prison which was built by convicts in the 1850s, will get $12 million. With more than 18,000 people in the state on the waiting list for public housing, and private rentals few and far between, housing is at critical levels across the state. This year's budget is focused on incentives for developers to boost supply, including a 50 per cent land tax concession for new build-to-rent projects. There are no new state housing building projects listed in the budget this year, but $31.4 million has been allocated to spot purchases of existing housing stock. With the unemployment rate the lowest in the nation at 3.4 per cent, it's a good time to be looking for a job in WA. The government estimates almost 69,000 people will have found a job by the end of the current financial year, and about 29,000 people next financial year. The participation rate is also sky-high at 70 per cent, which the government says is the highest on record for any state. There is more money for education, with the total spend up 4.7 per cent or $264 million. The emphasis is on students with special needs, with $32 million in extra funding being provided. This includes specialist learning programs for students with autism, which will be expanded to eight additional schools. There is also money for the development of a new framework for students with disabilities and complex behaviours. Last December's mid-year economic review provided long-sought-after relief for public servants, when the annual price cap on public sector wages was lifted. That pay freeze had been in place since the McGowan government was elected in 2017. A pay rise of 2.75 per cent per annum over two years was announced in December, but unions have signalled their unhappiness with a deal that falls well behind inflation. They will be sorely disappointed with today's budget, which offered no further improvements, despite Perth's inflation rate running at 7.6 per cent in the past quarter according to the ABS, and national inflation at 5.1 per cent. As already mentioned, there's money to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles and for charging infrastructure. There's also $31 million for climate action research and $62 million to get Rottnest Island to transition to 75 per cent renewable energy. Ending logging in state forests and supporting communities transitioning away from the native timber industry is also funded to the tune of $30 million.

16,Hunter Valley Police allege seized cocaine 'destined' for the Scone Cup,health,"  Hunter Valley Police allege seized cocaine 'destined' for the Scone Cup For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency NSW Police have arrested a pub licensee as part of investigations into alleged drug supply activity ahead of a major horse racing event in the Hunter Valley this weekend. The licensee of the Thoroughbred Hotel in Scone is among three men arrested on drug supply charges, following what police have described as an ""extensive investigation"". The Scone Cup starts tomorrow and is one of the biggest horse racing events in the state, attracting thousands of visitors to the small Upper Hunter town. Officers from Strike Force Bunks, which was established by Hunter Valley police in December 2021, swooped on Wednesday. There is no suggestion the arrests are linked to this week’s massive cocaine haul at the Port of Newcastle. A 37-year-old man was arrested at the Thoroughbred Hotel about 3pm, before the premises was searched as well as two homes in the Scone area. Detective Inspector Matt Zimmer told the ABC that the police will allege that the man was involved in the supply of cocaine ""on an ongoing basis in the Scone area"". ""It became evident to us that the cocaine seized by police yesterday was destined for supply and use over the course of the next few days, coinciding with the Scone Cup,"" he said. Police say a number of items were seized and will undergo forensic examination. The man is facing six charges including drug possession and supply, and police will also allege he was supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis, and permitted the sale of drugs at the licensed premises. Det. Insp. Zimmer said the seized substance was undergoing forensic testing to determine its purity, and will allege the amount is a ""greater than an indictable quantity"". Meanwhile, Surry Hills detectives arrested two men, aged 30 and 42, at a local hotel earlier on Wednesday. During a subsequent search of the men, who police say are also from Scone, police will allege they located cocaine and cannabis, which were seized for forensic examination. The pair was charged with supply and possession offences and granted bail. The three men will appear in Scone Local Court next month.

17,"South Australia records 4,696 new COVID-19 cases and seven deaths",health,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency South Australia has reported another seven deaths of people with COVID-19, as well as 4,696 new infections. SA Health said the deaths were of three women and four men, aged in their 80s and 90s. The number of hospitalisations has dropped from 232 yesterday to 210 today, with seven of those in intensive care and two on ventilation. After hovering around 21,000 in recent days, the number of total active cases has jumped back up and sits at 23,183. Eight deaths were reported in SA yesterday, and there have now been 393 fatal cases in the state since the start of the pandemic. The daily figure of 4,696 is about 400 more than the number reported yesterday and coincides with a slight uptick in the number of PCR tests administered. Authorities in recent days have been urging flu vaccinations ahead of winter, partly to reduce pressure on the health system. Earlier today, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) released data showing ambulance ramping in the state had worsened in the 2020-21 year. The AMA report showed that only 54 per cent of patients were transferred from ambulances to hospital emergency departments within 30 minutes — significantly less than the 90 per cent target. SA was the second-worst ranked state, after Tasmania, but outperformed the ACT and Northern Territory. SA Health Minister Chris Picton said easing pressures on the system would be a major focus of next month's state budget. ""We outlined a plan over four years — this involves building new hospital wards, significant investment in mental health, staff need to be trained and hired,"" he said. ""The focus is on making sure we are building additional capacity, hiring additional doctors and nurses.""

18,WA's COVID death toll climbs as cases remain at high levels,health,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency COVID case numbers in Western Australia have dipped slightly from yesterday's record, however the state's death toll from the virus has risen, with six more deaths reported to WA Health overnight. Yesterday more than 17,000 cases were recorded for the first time in WA, but the numbers declined to 16,670 new infections today. As of 8pm last night, WA had 75,581 active cases of COVID-19 with 275 people in hospital, unchanged from yesterday's figure. However, there are now eight people in ICU, one more than yesterday, and a further six deaths have been reported, dating back to May 3. They include two women in their 90s, two women in their 80s, a man in his 60s and a woman in her 50s. WA Health said the death of a woman in her 40s in April has now been reclassified as a non-COVID-related death. The current death toll in WA since the start of the year is now at 169, three more than the number of people who died on WA roads in 2021. According to the WA Health Department, there have been 178 COVID-related deaths since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. Before the start of this year the state had only reported nine COVID-related deaths. Of the 16,670 new infections reported today, 5,317 were confirmed via PCR tests with the remaining 11,353 self-reported positive rapid antigen tests. A total of 16,050 tests were conducted at either state-run or private pathology clinics yesterday, which was almost 3,000 thousand fewer than the day before when 19,360 PCR tests were conducted. While today's figures are slightly lower than yesterday, the recent surge in cases is having an impact on the hospital system. Yesterday, a code yellow was declared at three of WA's major hospitals — Fiona Stanley Joondalup and Sir Charles Gairdner. A code yellow is defined by WA Health as ""infrastructure and other internal emergencies"", and means the emergency department is full and unable to accept patients. AMA WA emergency department spokesman, David Mountain, told ABC Radio Perth it was concerning. ""They're [code yellows] extraordinarily bad,"" Dr Mountain said. ""By the time code yellows are declared, that means there's nothing left in the hospital to open, that patients are basically just jamming up in emergency departments. ""There's lots of ramping, lots of people spending many, many hours in the wait room before they get seen, many other patients spending up to 24, 36, 48 hours down in the emergency department waiting for a bed upstairs."" Dr Mountain said the state of play within the hospital system was ""very, very poor at the moment for any number of reasons"". ""Lack of staffing and lack of ability to open wards is the major one that's just driven what was already a system that was already in deep trouble further into the troubles,"" he said. More than 2,000 members of the state's health workforce are furloughed at the moment, and Dr Mountain said the number of staff off work with the virus was only part of the issue. ""Because of COVID, but not with COVID, so that's part of the issue,"" he told ABC Radio Perth. ""Part of the problem is the bureaucracy, which is always troublesome, means that people who are furloughed but actually don't have COVID, find it difficult to get back into work, there's like a disincentive for people to come in and we need to make that process much simpler. ""Really, it should just be a RAT test [sic] in the morning, if you're negative and you want to work, you should be allowed to come in and work. Confirmed cases so far: 523,052 Active cases: 81,843 Cases in hospital: 279 Deaths: 181 WA population aged 16+ triple-dosed: 80.7 per cent Latest information from the WA Health Department ""People are much more likely to be dying at the moment because of lack of staff and people being furloughed than they are from COVID itself."" Dr Mountain said he would like to see a return of the mask mandate to try to get the state's current Omicron outbreak back under control. ""The fact is we had 17,000 [cases] yesterday, it was well over 10,000 on average in the previous week, well above our previous peak,"" he said. ""We're clearly on an escalating phase again at the moment. ""We need to do something to try and stop this and make sure we can actually run a health system that that doesn't, you know, harm people.""

19,"For some of Australia's nurses, working on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic cemented their reason for being in the profession",health,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Constant exposure to illness and chemicals, shifts extending beyond 12 hours and inescapable feelings of burnout. Nursing is one of the most physically demanding and mentally taxing professions. Throw in a global pandemic and you've got all of the above exacerbated by hazardous work environments, lack of essential resources and inadequate staffing. Despite it all, some nurses have felt a sense of reward and fulfilment beyond imaginable. We spoke to some of those who have worked on the front line during the pandemic in recognition of International Nurses Day. Shikha Prasad, 22, is a cancer care nurse at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital's Metro North Health. She provides chemotherapy, education and psychosocial treatments to patients. Often, the patients Shikha cares for are immunocompromised and have a likelihood of developing more severe complications with COVID-19 than the rest of the population. ""Seeing the anxiety this causes in patients has had a big impact in the level of psychosocial care required,"" she said. ""The camaraderie of my colleagues has been incredible. It really has been a team effort to continue to provide the quality of care we do to our community."" Despite the challenges and setbacks the pandemic has created, Shikha remains passionate about supporting patients and nurses alike. ""I’m excited to see the profession of nursing continue to evolve,"" she said. From a young age, Nick McGregor, 60, knew he wanted to be a nurse. But when he first applied to be one at the age of 18, he was rejected because male nurses were unheard of. Now a veteran of the nursing industry, Nick works in the community and aged care space at Pinangba’s Star of the Sea Aged Care Facility on Thursday Island, Queensland. “For close to a year, I spent 6-7 days a week at work, so my lifestyle became work,"" he said. Despite the impacts the pandemic made on his personal life, Nick says he and his team adapted quickly. ""Our staff were already working long days in full PPE, despite very high temperatures. ""It wasn't anything new — we all just got on with it."" Melinda Daniels, 46, is the Assistant Director of Clinical Services at Buderim Private Hospital. She oversees multiple units, including main theatres, recovery, endoscopy and more. With over 200 staff reporting to her, she's in the driver's seat to influence positive change and support a community of nurses. ""I'm very proud that during my 28 years as a nurse, I've managed to fit in having five beautiful children and become a role model to them,"" she said. ""I feel like I've shown them you can work hard and have a successful career, while still having a family."" But Melinda has also experienced her fair share of challenges during the pandemic. ""Like many, I am a working mother, my husband works away and I have five kids,"" she said. Melinda says the biggest challenge for her was introducing home schooling during when schools were closed. ""I'm a very good nurse but I have a new level of respect and admiration for teachers,"" she said. A Clinical Nurse Consultant in Infection Control for Central West Hospital and Health Service, Topaz Stringfellow, 28, says being a nurse means having to be ""resilient and adaptable"". ""I wanted a career that would give me a sense of purpose,"" Topaz said. ""No-one I know went into nursing for the money."" From working in pop-up clinics with ocean views to freezing cold cities and the outback, Topaz says she never saw herself working in these areas. ""The past few years have truly been a mix of highs and lows,"" she said. ""I've learned so many lessons and had lifelong experiences I never thought I would have gotten as a nurse."" Working at St Andrew’s War Memorial Hospital in Brisbane as a graduate scrub/scout nurse, Georgia Stephens, 23, started her nursing career in the thick of the pandemic. While she found it daunting at first, Georgia found a silver lining. ""I was so exhausted from finishing university and starting my graduate nursing year that the lockdowns were a great excuse to stay home and get a few more hours of sleep,"" Georgia said. For Georgia, working in theatre meant that she already had to wear PPE, so most of the COVID-19 restrictions didn't come as a shock to her. ""It was more that I had to start from square one again, since they don’t teach theatre nursing at university. It's a fast paced and tense environment — anything and everything can happen,"" she said. Georgia doesn't deny the fact that the pandemic put a significant mental and physical strain on nurses in every field, but she remains hopeful for the future. ""I’m not sure what the solution is, but I hope it will improve and we can solve it soon for our profession,"" she said.

20,Move to protect abortion rights fails to pass US Senate,health,"  Abortion bill fails to pass in US Senate, as Supreme Court weighs overturning Roe v Wade For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Legislation to make abortion legal throughout the United States has been defeated in the US Senate, amid solid Republican opposition and support from one Democrat representative. Democrats had sought to head off an impending Supreme Court opinion that is expected to overturn the nearly 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision, which established the national right to abortion. Wednesday's effort was a protest gesture that never stood much chance of success. With 49 votes in support and 51 against, the Women's Health Protection Act was 11 short of the 60 votes needed to be fully debated in the 100-member Senate. All 50 Republicans voted to block the bill. They were joined by a lone Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin. Before the vote, more than two dozen House Democrats, mainly women, marched from the House of Representatives to the Senate, chanting: ""My body, my decision"". They then entered the Senate chamber and sat quietly along a back wall while senators debated abortion rights. US President Joe Biden expressed his disappointment in the outcome of the vote via Twitter and urged voters to elect more pro-choice senators. ""As fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court, Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women's Health Protection Act,"" he wrote. ""They have chosen to stand in the way of Americans' rights to make the most personal decisions about their own bodies, families and lives,"" Mr Biden wrote. ""To protect the right to choose, voters need to elect more pro-choice senators this November, and return a pro-choice majority to the House. If they do, Congress can pass this bill in January, and put it on my desk, so I can sign it into law."" Last September, the House voted 218-211 to pass an abortion rights bill nearly identical to the Senate bill. Although the Senate defeat was widely expected, Democrats hope the vote will help propel more of their candidates to victory in the November 8 mid-term elections, as public opinion polls show deep support among voters for abortion rights. That, in turn, could bolster future attempts to legalise abortion through legislation. The end of Roe v Wade would dramatically impact reproductive rights in the US. It would also likely have symbolic consequences globally, shaping the strategies and tactics of the trans-national anti-abortion movement. America's decades-old battle over abortion rights exploded anew last week when the Supreme Court confirmed the authenticity of a draft opinion that signalled it will soon overturn Roe v Wade. Such a decision would leave it up to individual states to determine their abortion policies. The High Court ruling is expected by the end of its current term, which usually concludes in late June. At least 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion if the top court strikes down Roe v Wade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which advocates for sexual and reproductive health rights. Following the vote, Vice-President Kamala Harris condemned Republican leaders in their quest to criminalise abortion in the US. ""Sadly, the Senate failed to stand in defence of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body,"" Ms Harris told reporters in the Capitol. ""What we are seeing around this country are extremist Republican leaders seeking to criminalise and punish women for making decisions about their own body."" For almost 50 years, Dr Warren Hern has performed abortions in Colorado, a liberal safe haven for the women of Texas and other conservative states. Republican Senator John Cornyn called the legislation ""a radical abortion-on-demand bill"" that goes further than Roe v Wade and ""essentially makes abortion available on demand from the time of conception to the time of delivery"". Closed-door talks were held on a possible compromise abortion rights bill, although it was unclear whether Democratic and Republican negotiators would be able to come to agreement, much less lure the 60 votes needed for any such measure. Opinion polls have shown the right to abortion to be broadly popular. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found 63 per cent of respondents — including 78 per cent of Democrats and 49 per cent of Republicans — would be more likely to back candidates in November's elections who support abortion rights.

21,Western Australia is flush with cash but it's not all smooth sailing for the state budget,health,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Western Australia is overflowing with cash, but despite the multi-billion-dollar surpluses it's not all smooth sailing for Mark McGowan as he prepares to hand down his second budget as Treasurer. Over the last few weeks, he's been proudly telling West Australians they've achieved the COVID ""soft landing"" he's been speaking about for months. Today's budget was meant to be the next part of that – another huge surplus, buoyed in part by strong iron ore prices and the dividends of the state's GST deal. Together with the government's management of the state's finances, it leaves little need for tough measures like cuts or cost hikes. On the government's initial modelling, the COVID peak was meant to have well and truly passed, delivering a near fairytale ending to the pandemic as West Australians embraced living with COVID and case numbers slowly trended downwards. But instead, the Treasurer is handing down the budget as the state endures a soaring second wave, pushing an already teetering health system to the brink, and taking growing numbers of West Australians out of the workforce when they need their paycheques more than ever. The significant surplus will at least soften those blows a little, but still leaves the Premier with one big question: how to spend the billions overflowing from government coffers. Despite daily case numbers now close to double what they were at the state's last peak, many are getting on with living with the virus. High booster rates mean testing positive is nowhere near as bad as it would have been for most, and many workplaces are adapting to the number of people stuck at home. But hospitals and ambulances are not workplaces that can function without sufficient staff on the ground. For years the health system has been struggling to keep up, but now it seems to have reached breaking point. Monday's warning ambulances could be delayed reaching patients was the latest unprecedented height of the crisis – highlighting both the lack of beds to treat patients in and the pressure rising COVID cases are adding to the system. The government has already announced some of what the budget will bring in this area, including $252 million worth of changes to emergency care and $30.1 million (that was promised at the election) for more regional ambulances and paramedics. But the only additional capacity to be announced in Perth is 10 new beds in Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital's intensive care unit. More are on the way before the end of the year, having been funded previously, but even with last year's record surplus, the issue couldn't be resolved. Healthcare staff say they need even more beds and staff, but with an overheated construction sector and global demand for doctors and nurses, neither will arrive soon. ""Real-time"" modelling of WA's Omicron outbreak finds about half a million more people will be infected and deaths will double by the end of June. The Premier has been quick to point out WA's health system is the best funded per capita of all the states, but it seems that still isn't enough. There will be many who hope the past few weeks have delivered a wake-up call to the need for even greater long-term investment. While WA's coffers are overflowing, the battle with rising cost of living has far surpassed COVID as the major worry for most West Australians. For some, it surely will be made worse by a COVID diagnosis leaving them unable to work for a week or more at a time when inflation means their income is stretching less and less. Inflation isn't an issue affecting just West Australians, but the state is copping it worse than many other places around the country. Perth alone saw the greatest jump in inflation over the last year of anywhere in the country – 7.6 per cent, compared to 5.1 per cent nationally. An electricity credit, similar to what the government gave West Australians in 2020 is expected to be one of the measures in this year's budget. Last time it cost taxpayers $600 million and it's likely to be less this year with households receiving a smaller credit. Many West Australians would rightly expect more than that given the money the government has to throw around. The other obvious place to put this year's surplus is into paying down state debt. ""There will never be a better opportunity for any state government, now or in the future, to pay down debt,"" shadow treasurer Steve Thomas said. ""No government will have the level of surpluses that this government has."" Mr McGowan was yesterday keen to make the point he didn't have to choose in this budget between measures to ease cost of living pressures and paying down debt. ""The good thing about my government and Western Australians is we've managed the finances responsibly over our five years in office, which gives us the capacity to do things like that, at the same time we are paying down debt,"" he said. Of course, there's myriad other projects and causes that deserve, and would love to receive, extra funding, and social housing is just one of them. Thanks to pressures on the housing and construction sectors, the number of social homes in WA has barely grown over the last year. Those working in the space want to see more money put aside to buy houses for those who need them, with 18,837 applications on the waitlist at the end of April. It can't be forgotten this all comes just over a week out from a federal election, where Labor is attempting to paint itself as a party of good financial management. ""WA has been incredibly successful over the last few years,"" Mr McGowan was keen to remind the Labor faithful at the party's national campaign launch. ""Some of the best economic, health and social outcomes in the entire world. The lowest unemployment rate of all the states, the strongest set of finances, the only government in Australia in surplus and the only government paying down debt. ""We know that it is Labor governments that best manage our economy and responsibly manage our finances."" The efforts of the Premier, and his government, have certainly been a key part of the reason why WA is in the position it is. It's a fact that certainly won't hurt his party's argument on the national stage. But what may matter most for West Australians is just how much of that success can be put towards making a real difference in their lives.

22,Can't get a haircut? The reasons are lengthy…,health,"  Staff shortages due to lengthy red tape for skilled migrants, employers say For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Having lost thousands of dollars in business due to staff shortages, hairdresser Elizabeth Stillisano is not sure what to do next or what lies ahead for the future of her small business. Struggling to find suitably qualified staff locally, her attempts to bring in hairdressers from overseas have been stymied by an expensive, long-winded and ultimately unproductive process. Speaking with Nadia Mitsopoulos on ABC Radio Perth, Ms Stillisano said although she had five qualified staff at her Bayswater salon, it was still hard to find senior hairdressers. Since 2018 she has been looking to expand her team, and in 2021 she thought she had found the perfect candidate. ""I had a lovely lady, Leona from Canada, lined up,"" Ms Stillisano said. ""I started the application process in April of 2021 and our business was approved quite quickly as an approved sponsor."" The next step was to make a nomination for a staff member. She did so with Leona, who had nine years of hairdressing experience. To qualify, employers must also prove that they have searched for suitable applicants within Australia for a minimum of four weeks on approved platforms. The Department of Home Affairs requires employers to post advertisements on multiple job sites with a nationwide reach, including on the national Jobactive platform. ""We did have Australians apply but they didn't have the qualifications. They weren't suitable to fill the role,"" Ms Stillisano said. ""It is actually a three-year qualification in Australia to become a hairdresser. The only applicants who were qualified persons were from overseas."" But in March, her nomination for Leona was declined with a refusal letter from Home Affairs which said she had not tried hard enough to find an Australian worker. The process cost them both several thousand dollars and took more than 12 months. Ms Stillisano said it was well known that there were skills shortages, and hairdressers had been in the top 10 of the government's national skill shortage list of trades for 20 years. ""It just seems a little redundant that we have to actually prove to the government that we are struggling to find hairdressers when we're actually, in fact, very high up on the skill shortage list,"" she said. Ms Stillisano said many employers believed the requirement for labour market tests for industries on the national skill shortage list should be suspended. She said although the federal government did a lot last year to help with boosting apprentice numbers, it still took three years for them to qualify. ""There's going to be a further 18 months or so shortfall where businesses are struggling to hire staff,"" she said. Doris Dengel, a registered migration agent with ESS Worldwide, agreed that suspending the labour market test would be a good idea. ""I would think, certainly, temporarily suspending it would help,"" she said. ""It has, over time, become harder and harder, longer, more expensive. So it becomes a bit of an inflexible system for employers."" She said employers might have more success going through immigration agents such as herself. ""It certainly helps to, I think, cooperate with an immigration agent to avoid possible refusals because we do this on a daily basis,"" she said. ""We can certainly make sure — as much as we can, at least — we get a visa at the end and the worker can come over."" One permanent resident, Pamela, said that it took eight years and cost $80,000 for herself, a cleaner, and her stonemason husband to get through the process of becoming a permanent resident and migrant worker. ""The cost is on the potential worker, unable to claim government assistance while looking to contribute to our country,"" she said. ""We're coming here to work hard and pay taxes and to help. We're not here to steal your jobs."" Ms Stillisano was also keen to emphasise that the arrangements were not designed to take jobs permanently. ""The sponsorships are only for a short-term sponsorship, two years. So it's not like we're bringing overseas workers over to fill an Australian role for the next 10 to 20 years,"" she said. In response, the Department of Home Affairs said ""the government is committed to supporting the skills needs of businesses through access to overseas workers where Australian workers are not available"". The government regularly calibrates Temporary Skill Shortage visa settings to meet labour market needs. However, ""Labour Market Testing is a legislative requirement that must be satisfied before a Temporary Skilled Shortage (TSS) nomination can be approved."" With figures provided by the Department of Home Affairs, there were currently 94,600 TSS visa holders in Australia.

23,"Former police officer calls for mental health overhaul, after three recent suicides",health,"  Former NT Police officer calls for an overhaul of mental health services following recent suicides For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Paul Milne finds it hard to shake off the time he came face to face with a saltwater crocodile during a dramatic police rescue in the Northern Territory. The former NT Police Sergeant was called to the Mary River in the Top End in 2013 to save a woman's life after her houseboat capsized in the croc-infested waters. ""At the time I just didn't think anything of it,"" he said. ""You do your job, you're robotic, you go numb, you don't worry about danger, you're trained."" Mr Milne remembers having to pull the woman's body out of the river in a tinny and moving it to the water's edge so paramedics and police could conduct CPR. Crocodiles were closing in on the group and Mr Milne said he had to act on his feet and fire his gun to keep the reptiles away. ""There were a lot of crocodiles coming up onto the bank and one came within half a metre of me, so I almost got taken,"" he said. The woman could not be saved, and as the weeks passed for Mr Milne, signs of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) started to surface. ""I went to Crocodylus Park one day with the kids and saw a crocodile and I flipped out,"" he said. ""It just spun me out, I just stopped in my tracks, and it knocked me for six."" His traumatic experience at Mary River didn't stop with just the crocodiles. Regular police call outs became harder for the police leader to manage, and he was struggling to turn up to work. ""One minute I'm driving a patrol car down the road in Palmerston, then my chest starts beating a million miles an hour going to a simple job,"" he said. ""I'm thinking to myself 'what is going on, this is normal for me, I can deal with this … I'm stronger than this."" But it was the Christmas-New Year period that year that Mr Milne said ""pushed him"" over the line and brought his decade-long career with NT Police to an end. He said his unit had a bad run, responding to ""eight deaths within eight weeks"". He said the impact took its toll on everyone. ""We were getting absolutely smashed,"" he said. ""Every shift, we would have a death, or go to a critical incident like a sexual assault, or a fatal."" In 2017, Mr Milne was medically retired from the force because of his PTSD and moved with his family to Victoria to access specialist mental health support that he could not get in the Northern Territory. Get a selection of the best mental health content from across the ABC by subscribing to our monthly newsletter From his home in the Dandenong Ranges, news of a ""cluster"" of suicide deaths involving Northern Territory police officers has hit Mr Milne hard. NT Police have confirmed two serving police officers and one retired member have died by suicide in the past three months. Mr Milne said he feels a mix of ""despair and devastation"" for the men he used to work with and is calling for cultural change to the way mental health is handled in the ranks. ""It is a major issue,"" he said. ""If three teachers had committed suicide it would be all over national news … what is going on, something needs to be done right now."" Mr Milne is not the first person to break ranks and speak out about mental health in the blue brigade. Ex-Northern Territory police officers are speaking out about mental health issues in the force and say there's inadequate resources available to help them cope. ABC Radio Darwin has interviewed several current and former members about the issue, with some remaining anonymous out of fear of losing their jobs. Acting Police Commissioner Michael Murphy said the deaths have ""rocked the police force"". ""Policing is a tough gig, we see things, people see things that you can't unsee ... it basically challenges your understanding of human nature,"" he told ABC Radio Darwin. Acting Commissioner Murphy said an independent review into the health and wellbeing of services provided by NT Police had finished, with the findings to be discussed with the Northern Territory Police Association (NTPA). In a statement, the association's president, Paul McCue, said there was an ""overwhelming need for an overhaul of services"" for members of the force. ""Our members have faced an extremely challenging two year period being pushed to the limit during the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent resourcing pressures,"" the statement reads. Mr Milne remembers what it was like facing a mental health crisis and trying to ""keep face"" at work. He said he was treated differently by some colleagues when word of his PTSD got out, which he said added to his feelings of isolation. ""There is a definite stigma about it,"" he said. ""It was like, 'Oh no, he's on workers comp, he's probably faking it, he's a faker, he hasn't got a real condition, we can't see it, he's faking it', that's how it's seen."" The 48-year-old is calling for a re-think of the way mental health is handled in the force and said officers need regular support, during and after, their careers. ""We don't talk about it, we'll have a few beers and then we do that every week and there's a pattern where we just numb it, we just numb the trauma every week,"" he said. ""We do that for year on year and that just builds up and suddenly it'll just pop."" Acting Commissioner Michael Murphy said work needs to be done to ""shake the stigma attached to mental health"", so officers feel comfortable to come forward. ""They can come to me directly .... they won't lose their jobs, we'll offer them all the support they can (get),"" Commissioner Murphy said. Mr Milne is now a stay-at-home father to his four children and said his schedule is tight between meeting their needs and his own, to stay healthy. He wants his former colleagues in the Northern Territory to know that PTSD 'can creep up' and to seek help if they need it. ""You're not alone, if you need to talk to someone, please do, we are all here together, even though it doesn't feel like it sometimes and never give up,"" he said. ""If I can be a part of the change, well so be it, I'll be a part of it, I'm ready to help.""

24,One in three people are infected with this parasite – and the clue could be in your eyes,health,"  One in three people are infected with Toxoplasma parasite – and the clue could be in our eyes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Toxoplasma gondii is probably the most successful parasite in the world today. This microscopic creature is capable of infecting any mammal or bird, and people across all continents are infected. Once infected, a person carries Toxoplasma for life. So far, we don't have a drug that can eradicate the parasite from the body. And there is no vaccine approved for use in humans. Across the world, it's estimated 30–50 per cent of people are infected with Toxoplasma — and infections may be increasing in Australia. A survey of studies conducted at blood banks and pregnancy clinics across the country in the 1970s put the infection rate at 30 per cent. However, a recent Western Australian community-based study found 66 per cent of people were infected. The disease caused by this parasite can scar the back of the eye. Our new research looked for signs of disease in otherwise healthy people and found a significant number bore the mark of Toxoplasma. The cat is the primary host for Toxoplasma. Cats catch the parasite when they eat infected prey. Then, for a couple of weeks, they pass large numbers of parasites in their faeces in a form that can survive for long periods in the environment, even during extreme weather. When the faeces are ingested by livestock while grazing, parasites lodge in the muscle and survive there after the animals are slaughtered for meat. Humans can become infected by eating this meat, or by eating fresh produce or drinking water soiled by cats. It is also possible for a woman infected for the first time during pregnancy to pass the infection to her unborn child. While infection with Toxoplasma is extremely common, the most important health statistic is the rate of the disease caused by the infection, which is called toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma really likes the retina, the multi-layered nerve tissue that lines the eye and generates vision. Infection can cause recurring attacks of retinal inflammation and permanent retinal scarring. This is known as ocular toxoplasmosis. Contrary to much that is written about ocular toxoplasmosis, medical research shows this condition usually affects healthy adults. However, in aged persons or people with a weakened immune system, or when contracted during pregnancy, it can be more severe. An attack of active inflammation causes ""floaters"" and blurred vision. When the inflammation progresses to scarring, there may be permanent loss of vision. In a study of patients with ocular toxoplasmosis seen at a large ophthalmology clinic, we measured reduced vision to below driving level in more than 50 per cent of eyes, and 25 per cent of eyes were irreversibly blind. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are quite familiar with managing ocular toxoplasmosis. But the extent of the problem is not widely recognised, even by the medical community. The number of Australians with ocular toxoplasmosis had never been measured, until now. We wanted to investigate the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in Australia, but we knew it would be challenging to get funding for a major survey of this neglected disease. So, we used information collected for a different purpose: as part of the Busselton Healthy Ageing Study, retinal photographs were taken from more than 5,000 baby boomers (born 1946–64) living in Busselton, Western Australia. The photographs were gathered to look for other eye diseases, macular degeneration and glaucoma. By screening these retinal photographs, we estimated the prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis at one in 150 Australians. This might seem surprisingly common, but it fits with the way people catch Toxoplasma. In addition to pet cats, Australia has huge populations of feral cats. And Australia is home to a lot of farmland, including over 50 per cent of the global organic farming area. Most importantly, many Australians like to eat their red meat rare, putting them at real risk. To diagnose ocular toxoplasmosis, a retina examination is necessary, ideally with the pupils dilated. The retinal lesion is easy to spot, because of the way Toxoplasma activates retinal cells to produce certain proteins, and an ophthalmologist or optometrist can immediately recognise the appearance. Often a blood test is also performed to make the diagnosis. If the condition is mild, the doctor may let the body's own immune system control the problem, which takes a few months. However, usually a combination of anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic drugs is prescribed. Toxoplasma infection is not curable, but it can be prevented. Meat sold in Australian supermarkets may harbour Toxoplasma. Cooking meat to an internal temperature of 66C or freezing it ahead of cooking are ways to kill the parasite. Fresh fruit and vegetables should be washed before eating, and drinking untreated water (such as straight from rivers or creeks) should be avoided. Gloves should be worn when changing cat litter, and hands washed afterwards. The World Health Organisation and other international and national health bodies are promoting an approach called One Health for diseases that cross humans, animals and their environments. This involves different sectors working together to promote good health. Now we know just how common ocular toxoplasmosis is in Australia, there is real justification to harness One Health to combat Toxoplasma infections in this country. Justine R. Smith is a professor of eye and vision health at Flinders University. Joao M. Furtado is an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Universidade de Sao Paulo.

25,'A lot of biblical events tend to happen': Sperm donor secrecy sees records unnecessarily withheld,health,"  Sperm-donor-conceived Queenslanders turn to DNA databases to track down biological fathers For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency After years of desperately searching for their sperm-donor fathers, Queenslanders Kate Drysdale and Kerri Favarato used an ancestry DNA database and turned detective to find them. But as a Queensland Parliamentary committee prepares to investigate law reform around donor conception, both women hope the journey for others in their position — those conceived when sperm donation was cloaked in secrecy — is not as fraught. The women were conceived in different decades but with help from the same Brisbane fertility clinic. During multiple contacts with the clinic to request information about their biological fathers, they were separately told by different people at different times medical records may have been damaged by smoke and floods, or lost, or destroyed. ""A lot of Biblical events tend to happen within the record departments of fertility clinics,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""I don't mean to be facetious but so many donor-conceived people have been told that."" Having children of their own has intensified their desire to learn more about their biological heritage. Both women turned to science — and an American direct-to-consumer DNA testing company and database — to continue the search. So-called ancestry databases allow people to compare their own DNA against other publicly available genetic profiles to help them find blood relatives and to build a family tree. In the cases of Ms Drysdale, 30, and Ms Favarato, 39, it allowed them to identify their biological fathers even though neither man had registered a DNA sample on a consumer database at that time. Soon after giving birth to her daughter, Brisbane-based Ms Favarato spent five months of painstaking work piecing together her family tree after finding on a database a fourth cousin — a woman she shared great, great, great grandparents with. ""It was exhausting and really hard work but I needed it to be done,"" she said. ""I was so sick of going through the process of trying to find information and getting the door slammed in my face. ""I just went: 'This is my chance, I have to do this'."" By this stage, Ms Favarato had already spent about two decades looking. As a teenager, after learning her biological father had probably been a medical student, Ms Favarato accessed University of Queensland medical graduate records for the relevant years of the 1980s, making a list of potential candidates. ""I crossed out anyone that had an Asian or Indian sounding name and I crossed out all of the females,"" she said. ""Then I started writing letters to doctors, going: 'Are you my donor?'."" It came to nought. Years later, in February 2017, through DNA searches for blood relatives and hundreds of hours of detective work to develop her family tree, she finally had a match to a Brisbane doctor — Donald 'Digger' Whittaker. Impatient to speak to him, rather than write an email, she picked up the phone and dialled his clinic, leaving a message for him to return her call about ""a private family matter"". Within minutes, he called back. ""How do I know you?"" Dr Whittaker asked. ""Did you donate sperm in the 80s? I think you're my biological father,"" Ms Favarato replied. ""Oh my goodness. Hello darling. How are you? Tell me about yourself,"" Dr Whittaker answered. Five years on, they have what Ms Favarato describes as an ""undefinable"" relationship with ""reasonably regular"" contact. They visit each other's homes and she introduces him to people as ""my biological father"". ""He doesn't call me his daughter or anything like that,"" Ms Favarato said. ""We don't have the same relationship that I have with the dad who raised me. It's not like that, but it's an undeniable connection. ""We just don't bother labelling anything. It is what it is."" Kate Drysdale, who lives in Atherton, in Queensland's far north, with partner Andrew and their young son, has known she was donor-conceived since the age of seven. By then, her mother Carol and her non-biological father had divorced and he was no longer in their lives. ""My legal father and my mother disagreed as to whether or not I should be told. She'd always wanted me to know,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""She has a social work background. She understood the importance of knowing one's identity."" Before having her own child, Ms Drysdale had ""essentially given up"" on the idea of ever finding her biological father, given he had donated his sperm anonymously in the 1990s. She grew up knowing only that he had brown hair and green eyes and was a university student, based on information her mother had been provided by the clinic. But Ms Drysdale's desire to learn more about her genetic background grew after she gave birth to a son five years ago. Her son was still a baby when a television news story on donor conception triggered a renewed interest in her origins. With the support of her mother and after repeated phone calls and emails to the fertility clinic, she was able to obtain scant details about her biological father. Ms Drysdale's biological father had been a humanities student, his blood type was O-positive, he had three brothers and he was 21 years old at the time of his donation. After continuing to ""harass"" the clinic, she also learned of at least one donor-conceived half sibling, but the clinic could not tell her a gender or a birth date. ""Parents were not required to inform clinics whether the procedures had been successful and resulted in a child,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""Even if they had been recording information correctly, they weren't being provided it."" Finding contact with the fertility clinic tortuous, Ms Drysdale had her DNA tested and her genetic profile uploaded onto an online database. A couple of matches with distant cousins, including a 100-year-old woman living in Brisbane, who had already built an ""extensive family tree"", and another living in the United Kingdom, allowed her to trace her biological father's identity, using the small amount of information she was able to glean from the fertility clinic. It took her just three weeks. ""To be honest … If you get the matches through the DNA testing, it's not that hard to work out who the donor is,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""I knew nothing when I started."" As she contemplated her next step, the fertility clinic contacted her unexpectedly, telling her they had managed to track down her biological father and would organise mandatory counselling sessions before a potential meeting. Although she already knew his name, and how to contact him, Ms Drysdale chose to go down the clinic path fearing he may view being approached directly as ""disrespectful or invasive"". It would take a year before she finally had email contact with him and about two years before they finally met in Atherton in late 2020 along with his wife and their two children. ""The first question his wife asked me was: 'Do you have an overlapping tooth, too?',"" Ms Drysdale recalled. ""And I do. ""I always thought I looked like my mother until I met that man. He is the male version of me, just 21 years older."" Ms Drysdale and her biological father are both employed in the social science field, but more important to her is his personality. ""I had a negative view of what a father was growing up,"" she said. ""It's just really nice to find out that he is a positive, empathetic, kind human being that thinks about the world and wants to have a positive influence on it. ""So it's nice that that's the personality that I come from."" Meeting her biological father took years of trauma and heartache. The distress was only compounded when he told her he had given his details to the fertility clinic years earlier, making it clear he was open to contact, before she began her search for him. ""They either had no record of that, or … they just didn't bother to say anything,"" Ms Drysdale said. ""The clinic should have been able to simply consult their records, advise that he was open to contact and connect us. ""Instead, I experienced many months living in a state of near panic that I would not get any information or would ultimately be rejected by the person I had been searching for for so long."" Ms Drysdale is one of about 70 people who have made submissions to the Queensland parliament's Legal Affairs and Safety Committee's inquiry into matters relating to donor conception information, which will hear evidence on Friday. Her detailed 11-page submission calls for the establishment of a donor conception register, mandating clinics to provide ""full and accurate"" information in a timely manner, with penalties for non-compliance. She wants all donor-conceived people to also be able to access identifying information relating to donors and donor-conceived siblings, regardless of when they were conceived. Ms Drysdale would also like to see the birth certificates of donor-conceived people include a notation indicating they are donor conceived, with contact details for how to access further information. Given that some people source donor sperm, eggs or embryos from overseas, she is also calling for a ban on the importation of reproductive tissue if the international clinics involved cannot be held to Queensland standards. Her calls echo those of Donor Conceived Australia (DCA), an advocacy and support group for people conceived via assisted reproductive treatments, which has more than 500 members. DCA's 27-page submission to the parliamentary inquiry requests opt-in counselling for donor-conceived individuals, donors and their families as ""an essential aspect of managing information relating to donor conception"". ""Currently, there are no Queensland-based counselling services providing specialised support in the donor-conception sphere,"" the submission stated. It called for counselling to be provided by professionals not involved or affiliated with the fertility industry to ensure confidence they are ""independent, objective and focused on the interests of that client"". We offer tailored front pages for local audiences in each state and territory. Find out how to opt in for more Queensland news. DCA director Aimee Shackleton said her Queensland members often reported seeking help from local psychologists with ""absolutely no idea"" how to support them through the complex issues involved with donor conception. ""Donor Conceived Australia is hoping to be involved in creating competency-based accreditation courses for mental health professionals and calls for government-funded counselling to support donor-conceived people when they need it most,"" she said. Ms Shackleton said donor-conceived adults often turned to her organisation after years of searching for donors and after frequently being turned away by fertility clinics. ""They find there are no government agencies to help them,"" she said. ""They often realise they need to spend hundreds of dollars to send their genetic material to an American-based DNA company. ""Many also turn to paying professional genealogists or private investigators to do the work for them."" Since Kerri Favarato found her biological father, with her encouragement, Dr Whittaker has also supplied his own DNA profile to the same database that helped her find him. That resulted in Ms Favarato discovering six donor-conceived half siblings, all of them previously unaware they were conceived using donor sperm. ""Two of them I speak with very regularly. We've become almost like very close friends. We speak quite often,"" Ms Favarato said. As a young medical student, Dr Whittaker donated sperm two or three times a week for five years. It's impossible to know how many children he may have fathered, leaving Ms Favarato concerned about the unknown number of cousins her own children may have and the future potential for them to end up in a relationship with one of them. ""I have a nine-year-old and a five-year-old. They've got lots of cousins floating around,"" she said. ""When you talk about the numbers, it could be anywhere from 30 to 300, maybe more than that. Who knows? We don't know for sure. We'll never know. ""That's [lots of] first cousins running around that they have the potential to have relationships with."" Queensland fertility clinics are subject to National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines, which have required since September 2004 that donations of sperm, eggs and embryos can only take place if donors first consent to their information being made available, on request, once any conceived children turn 18. Under the guidelines, clinics must also take all reasonable steps to reduce the numbers of genetic relatives created through their donor programs. The Fertility Society of Australia's reproductive technology accreditation committee advises that ""a maximum of 10 donor families"" per sperm donor is acceptable, regardless of where those families are. University of Western Sydney law professor Sonia Allan, who has been studying legal issues surrounding donor conception for 20 years, described the accreditation committee system as ""self regulatory"". ""It is important to recognise that while advice or guidelines play an important role in setting standards, they do not have the force of the law,"" Professor Allan said. ""You should have the law behind it. What happens is that if it doesn't have legal force, the risk is, and this is certainly a risk in Queensland, that you have individuals or clinics who don't follow the guidance, as there is no enforceable obligation to do so. ""That can result in people having many more donor-conceived siblings than perhaps they should. ""Combined with a lack of information about their donor-conceived status and/or their biological relatives, this leads to an increased chance of them forming relationships with each other, meaning sexual relationships, because they don't know who their first-degree relatives are. ""You also create a situation where donor-conceived people live in fear or constant uncertainty. The impact on some people's lives is really unacceptable."" The Queensland parliamentary committee is due to hand down its report on donor conception law reform in August. As she awaits the outcome, Kate Drysdale will continue to build a relationship with her biological father. ""We will never have a father-daughter relationship because you can't get back 30 years of history,"" she said. ""I talk to him probably every couple of weeks on the phone, we update each other about what's happening in our lives. I see him as a friend."" Ms Drysdale's hopeful things will be different for her son — her biological father's first grandchild.

26,How can you vote when you're trapped in overseas COVID lockdowns?,health," Federal Election 2022 - Australia Votes For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency 阅读中文版本 Joanne Wood, an Australian banker who has lived in Shanghai for nearly two decades, has been watching the Australian federal election closely for months. Keeping up with election news and talking about it with her Australian friends and family has helped her feel less lonely and more connected during Shanghai's strict lockdown. So finding out that it was going to be practically impossible to vote this month was ""a huge disappointment"". ""I'm proud to be Australian. I feel fortunate that I was born Australian [and] that my voice can be heard and is welcomed,"" Ms Wood told the ABC. ""To lose that opportunity is something that makes me sad. It's disappointing."" Shanghai has been under a city-wide lockdown for more than a month, which has led to massive delivery delays and food shortages, and the government has given no indication of when it will be lifted. The Australian Consulate-General in Shanghai, where Australians would normally be able to vote in person, has been closed since April. On May 6, the Consulate-General advised on WeChat that Australians in the city should fill out an overseas notification form, which ""confirms the voter is unable to vote due to being overseas"". Australia and New Zealand have given up on trying to eliminate COVID-19, but China still refuses to learn to live with the virus. Here's why. Those who still wanted to vote would have to register for a postal ballot, which the Australian Election Commission (AEC) would send from Australia via its ""point-to-point courier delivery solution"". Voters would then have to return the completed ballot to the AEC or other Australian missions in China. Ms Wood said she did not think this would work. ""Your courier can't even deliver to your residential compound the basic groceries, [like] food and drinking water,"" she said. ""How on earth are you going to get voting papers from Australia to here? ""They [AEC] may be able to get them in to China, but could they get them to your door with all of the different checkpoints we have for COVID? I just didn't see that the timing would work. ""Even if you did manage to get it through international courier in time, filled it in, getting it back out into Australia in time was going to be as much of an issue."" ""Understanding that, I just took what I felt to be the easiest path of least resistance,"" she said, by filling out a form indicating she would be unable to vote. At the 2019 federal election, 9,177 votes were cast in-person in China, including 5,428 votes cast in Hong Kong. The AEC also sent out 3,768 postal votes to Australians in mainland China, including 1,728 in Shanghai. Tina Lan, another Australian citizen in Shanghai, said she did not believe it would be possible for her to vote either, even if there was time for the papers to go from Australia to China and back again. The AEC can accept ballot papers up to 13 days following election day. Ms Lan and her family were released from one of the city's quarantine facilities just last week and they are still required to remain at home. They were not even allowed to pick up mail or delivered items. ""I can't even get out of my apartment now as I am in this seven-day home isolation. It is impossible to mail [the ballot],"" she said. “Everything makes me feel like it is impossible to vote in this election."" She added that she was confused about the voting rules. ""No-one comes to tell you which day you need to send a letter and how far in advance you need to send it,"" she said. ""There is no way to even estimate how much time these things would take at the moment."" Shanghai authorities may be loosening the city's COVID lockdown, but after weeks of uncertainty, foreign workers are considering leaving. An AEC spokesperson said there was not much more they could do to facilitate postal voting if the compounds were restricted from receiving mail and courier deliveries. ""Information about the federal election and participating in the election is being distributed by consulates, through the AEC's website and social media channels and via an advertising campaign,"" the spokesperson said. ""If digital channels are restricted by a foreign country to the extent where this information is restricted, and postal services are also restricted, there is again not many, if any, other avenues available."" The spokesperson added that voting was not compulsory for Australians overseas, so anyone who missed the deadline would not be penalised. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said they were ""continuing to encourage Australians in China who have not already done so to register for a postal vote"". That included Australians planning to vote in person in Beijing and Guangzhou — where Australia has an embassy and consulate — ""in case this option becomes unavailable at short notice"". Simon Lance, a Western Australian businessman who has lived in Shanghai for more than 10 years, decided it was worth registering for a postal vote. He received confirmation from Australia Post that his voting package was on its way on May 7. Mr Lance told the ABC that residents in his compound were due to be able to receive some deliveries starting today, but he was not sure if Australia Post deliveries would get through. ""That's obviously a key component of it,"" he said. Yee-Fui Ng, deputy director of the Australian Centre for Justice Innovation at Monash University, said overseas voters were an essential part of the Australian community and including them in elections was critical. ""There is a balance between a public health crisis and exercising a fundamental democratic right,"" said Dr Ng, who will also vote overseas while visiting the United States. ""It's better to keep Australian citizens engaged in our democratic processes — wherever they are. ""I think the AEC should facilitate voting as much as possible, within the constraints of the public health emergency."" Chiara De Lazzari, a research fellow from the School of Social Sciences at Monash University, told the ABC that countries like Australia that allow overseas citizens to vote in the national elections ""should also be responsible to maintain a form of connection with those citizens"". However, she acknowledged that given the current circumstances, Australia lacked the capacity to ""evaluate the situation in each and every place where residents live"". ""For instance, Shanghai is one of the few places in lockdown while most people around the world are conducting a semi-normal life with very limited restrictions,"" she said. ""This causes significant challenges for countries that want to ensure citizens' participation from abroad."" Dr De Lazzari said an online system would make voting easier for overseas Australians. ""In the future, we should hope for the establishment of some form of electronic voting that will overcome all the logistic issues caused by the pandemic, in the circumstances in which people live in remote areas, or just to facilitate the voting process from abroad,"" she said. While online voting could be a potential option, Dr Ng warned it could be vulnerable to software manipulation, identity fraud, data breaches or information theft. So far, the only country in the world that permits electronic voting is Estonia, where voters can cast their ballots in local, national and European elections online with their personal digital devices. 阅读中文版本 See our full coverage of coronavirus We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

27,"A question weighed heavily on Gabriel when he was 18. When asked, his doctor said he'd be blind by age 40",health,"  Gabriel will be blind by the time he's 40. But his vision for his community is 'crystal clear' For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency When Gabriel Gervasoni was born, he was so pale that the nuns at the old Catholic hospital in Ballarat thought ""he must be an angel"", his mother, Mandy, quips. ""He had this bright white hair,"" she says. ""People keep commenting, 'He's so alert, he's looking at everything'. I thought, 'his eyes are moving a lot', but I didn't have a lot of experience with babies."" Though hitting the expected milestones, as the weeks passed, Mandy began to notice that when Gabriel would look at people, ""he was really only looking at the direction the sound was coming from"". The doctor tried to reassure her. He's just maturing late, they told her. ""Some babies do that."" But Mandy ""had an instinct"". She was referred to a paediatrician for a second opinion — a decision that would herald a two-decade search for answers. ""I was given multiple diagnoses over the years, like Leber's congenital amaurosis, retinitis pigmentosa, albinism,"" says Gabriel, who is legally blind and has a reduced field of vision. ""It's stressful and frustrating not having answers."" Having spent much of his life in diagnostic purgatory, as Gabriel entered adulthood a question began to weigh on him. It was obvious that ""something was concerning him"", Mandy says, and when Gabriel was about 18 years old, he asked his childhood ophthalmologist point-blank: ""Am I going to go blind?"" ""He said, 'Yes, you'll be blind by the time you're 40',"" Gabriel says. It's a difficult prospect to contemplate, but a path the duo have navigated once before. After visiting the paediatrician all those years ago, Gabriel, still just a newborn, was referred to one of the top ophthalmologists in Victoria, who conducted a series of tests. ""They played lights, they're similar to strobe lights, as though you're in a nightclub,"" Mandy says. ""He didn't even wake up. He just sat there with his little head in the machine with me holding him up."" She was told that Gabriel had no light recognition, meaning he ""couldn't tell if it was light or dark"", and wouldn't be able to see But as he grew older, something happened: he started to gain limited vision. At six months, he turned his head towards a window, something he'd never done before. A year later, he started ""being really hesitant"". ""He'd be walking along, and then all of a sudden he'd go, 'Oh',"" Mandy says. ""He was actually getting his navigational vision, so he was actually being able to see blurry shapes, which was terrifying for him because he'd never experienced that before."" Though life through Gabriel's lens is ""very blurry"", his photo reel is a treasure trove of memories, and a celebration of the everyday. There's the duck he saw in the park one morning, and the ""huge cat"" that walked past him. ""It makes me realise how fleeting things are,"" he says of his journey. ""I want to memorise that while I've still got vision."" The official term for his ""current diagnosis"" is an ill-defined form of retinal dystrophy. In layman's terms, it means Gabriel's vision will ""gradually go away"" and he'll be ""completely blind"" by the time he's 40. But while Gabriel found himself in ""complete shock by the 180 (degree change)"" in his development, it would ultimately only further fuel his passion to help ""others with a disability to lead fulfilling lives"". If you are aged between 16 and 22 and would like to find out more about the ABC Heywire Competition, go to the ABC Heywire website. More than 575,000 Australians are blind or vision impaired. And as a young person with a disability, Gabriel knows all too well the extra hurdles employment, education and even social activities can bring. ""I realised when I was young, being vision impaired, I wouldn't have as many opportunities as someone with full vision,"" he says. ""So I decided that I'll do as much as I can to support the community and to raise awareness for people with vision impairment and disabilities in general."" Determined to be a voice for those often left out of the conversation, he joined the City of Ballarat's Youth Council and the Central Highlands Youth Advisory Board to ensure the needs of young people were being heard. ""He's become a fantastic role model for many of our other youth volunteers because nothing can stop him,"" says Katja Fiedler, a youth development officer with the City of Ballarat. ""On some of our leadership camps, we've gone out bush and done kayaking or we're jumping off things, and Gabe's always the first to put his hand up to do something he's never done before."" The youth council brings together young people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, experiences and abilities, who ""provide insights that we might not get from internal discussions or consultations within council"", Katja says. Through his lived experience, Gabriel has helped shape the city's health and wellbeing plan, and provided important input into local master plans and redevelopment projects. ""It's really, really important to get his insights as a young person who's visually impaired, especially when it comes to accessibility but also refurbishing,"" Katja says. ""What could or should a space look like to make it inclusive, accessible, enjoyable and accommodating for young people with vision impairment but also other disabilities?"" Accessibility challenges are often something people don't consider, echoes Mandy, who has seen Gabriel go through a ""really big orientation process"". His reduced field of vision means ""all of his peripheral vision is gone"" — something they ""couldn't plan for"". But for Mandy — who has watched her son not just adapt to life's challenges, but grow as a person — there was never any question over whether his diagnosis would quell his passion. ""We all have challenges to face and this was his challenge,"" she says. ""He's pretty exceptional. I know that every mother says that, but he really is,"" she laughs. Evidently, it's not just his mum who thinks so. Gabriel was named Ballarat's Young Citizen of the Year for 2021, with judges pointing to his ""determination to contribute to the Ballarat community"" and passion about ""issues affecting youth and those with disabilities"". While those living with a disability face barriers across the board, regional communities must navigate unique challenges, including significantly reduced access to options and choices about services to support their needs. Gabriel wants to use his platform to ensure decision-makers ""embrace accessibility as a priority and to ensure that there are no barriers to people with disability being part of our community"". ""Making sure people have access to employment, education, community spaces and social activities, that's very important to me,"" he says. It's a belief shared by Sally Aurisch, CEO of Blind Citizens Australia, the national representative organisation of people who are blind or vision impaired. While ""accessibility on a spectrum is not too bad"" in Australia, she says, ""we do still have our fair share of challenges"". ""A story I heard recently from someone was that they lived in a very small town with one bus driver, it was a very long trip, so it was hard to gauge, and that driver didn't mention to this person when their stop was approaching,"" she says. ""But this person never felt confident to provide feedback to this to the service provider because they were the only blind person in town, so it was going to be very easy to identify who they were."" It's why ensuring those who live with a disability have a seat at the table is so important, she says. ""I think that disability and life experience, in general, affects us all differently, our needs are quite unique and diverse,"" she says. ""And so by bringing together a variety of voices, when we design services and programs, we can make sure that they meet that diverse group of needs."" Soft-spoken and humble, Gabriel hesitates to speak about his achievements. Thankfully, that's what mums are for. ""We put in a cabinet to put his awards in and now he's taken up the whole thing,"" Mandy laughs. ""He can't win any more awards because I can't fit them in. ""He feels like it's a real honour, but he's embarrassed about it, because to him, it's just like, 'That's just what you do mum. If you see a need, you fill that need, you help that person'."" As she watches her son continue to ""exceed the expectations"", as he has in the face of all of life's hurdles, Mandy has high hopes for her regional community. She longs for the day when there are no barriers to employment, education and social activities; when Gabriel can be ""just another face in the crowd"". ""Without there needing to be special adaptations, because those adaptations are automatically built-in,"" she says. ""I just hope that he feels able to do whatever he wants to do; that whatever his dreams and his passion is in life, that he can do that."" As Gabriel's diagnosis stands, he has another 20 years of sight — and he's determined to make the most of it. You'll find the 21-year-old walking around town ""looking at everything"" in his path. ""People who can see might walk past certain things without really noticing it, because they've probably walked past it a million times and will pass it another million times,"" he says. ""But for me, I walk past it and I don't know if it's going to be the last time I see it or not. I want to imprint everything that I see so I can appreciate it."" The ABC's Heywire competition is open to all regional Australians aged between 16 and 22. The annual competition provides a platform for the younger generation, in pockets of Australia that rarely see the spotlight, to ""tell it like it is"".

28,Former Australian of Year says Liberal MP selectively quoted him in surprise endorsement advertisement,health,"  For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency A former Australian of the Year and mental health advocate says Liberal MP Fiona Martin's campaign has selectively quoted him in a re-election endorsement for her without his knowledge. Patrick McGorry, the executive director of Orygen and professor of youth mental health at the University of Melbourne, has asked the Member for Reid to take down a digital ad in which he was featured. Professor McGorry told the ABC he was ""very concerned"" by the ads, targeted at young adults under 35 years old, published across Facebook and Instagram. ""I've called her to say I'm extremely concerned ... that my image and supportive comments have been used in the election campaign,"" he said. ""This was done without my knowledge and the authorisation and I've asked her to remove that from her election material."" Dr Martin told the ABC she had agreed to this request. Professor McGorry said he sent Dr Martin an email in March, before the election was called to thank her for chairing a parliamentary inquiry into mental health which was tabled at the end of last year. Dr Martin's ad, which also spruiked her involvement in mental health services, used only the first and last sentence of the 214-word email he sent her. ""Dear Fiona, I wanted to thank you for your committed and effective advocacy for investment and reform in mental health care,"" the ad read over an image of Professor McGorry. ""You have been a tireless leader and advocate for mental health not only nationally but also in your own Community. I hope your efforts are successful."" The below is the full email Patrick McGorry sent Fiona Martin on March 22, which he has given the ABC permission to publish. The bolded sections are words which were used in Dr Martin's ads. Dear Fiona I wanted to thank you for your committed and effective advocacy for investment and reform in mental health care.  The parliamentary inquiry you chaired on mental health, in collaboration with Emma McBride  from the ALP, was a key bipartisan process which has moved things forward in several important ways. Your professional background as a psychologist proved invaluable and is a unique asset for the field within the current parliament.  As you know, I led the advocacy alongside Angus Cleland of Mental Health Victoria which led to the creation and funding of the adult mental health hub model. Now branded as “Head to Health” Centres – these are being scaled up nationally, again with bipartisan support as has occurred with headspace.   I am delighted that you have been advocating strongly to have one of these key platforms of care in your own electorate.  These hubs are essential backup systems of care for GPs and psychologists for the “missing middle” – those Australians with more complex and sustained mental health conditions for which primary care is simply insufficient on its own.  In this and many other ways you have been a tireless leader and advocate for mental health not only nationally but also in your own community. I hope your efforts are successful. Kind regards Pat McGorry Professor McGorry said the quotes were selectively taken from his email, that he did not consent to it being published, and the ad could compromise his advocacy work. ""I've been absolutely strict over many years about a bipartisan approach to mental health ... so I'm very surprised to hear that information,"" Professor McGorry said. ""It seems to be implied in that statement that I'm basically advocating people vote for her, and I certainly never would have said that."" Dr Martin, in a statement to the ABC, said she had spoke to Professor McGorry and would remove the advertising. ""I have enormous respect for Professor Patrick McGorry,"" she said. ""We have been able to work closely together to achieve important outcomes in mental health and suicide prevention. Earlier this year, I asked Pat for words of endorsement that he had kindly provided, and unfortunately there was a misunderstanding about how those words would be used. ""We have spoken today, and I offered to rectify this misunderstanding by removing the advertising, which he has accepted."" The electorate is crucial for the Liberal Party in this election, and Dr Martin, who holds the Western Sydney seat by a 3.2 per cent margin, is trying to withstand a challenge from Labor candidate Sally Sitou. It is the second time in less than a day Dr Martin has come under the spotlight while on the campaign trail. Her Labor opponent Ms Sitou, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, has accused Dr Martin of confusing her for another Asian-Australian during a heated debate on 2GB. The Coalition has faced a barrage of criticism for featuring prominent charity figures and community leaders on endorsement materials without their knowledge or permission. News Corp on Wednesday reported that Ryan MP Julian Simmonds had distributed what purported to be a personal endorsement from a priest without authorisation. The Guardian reported that The Pyjama Foundation and Access Arts both demanded Brisbane MP Trevor Evans stop distributing material that appeared to offer him their endorsements.

29,Annual camp at Bear Cottage children's hospice provides a safe space for the 'forgotten mourners',health,"  Annual camp at Bear Cottage children's hospice provides a safe space for the 'forgotten mourners' For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Every year, a small group of grandparents gather together on the northern side of Sydney Harbour for a camp that honours the grandparenting role in family life. Unlike typical celebrations of childhood, the families at this gathering all have a common connection to Bear Cottage, a children's hospice based in Manly. Bear Cottage's registered art therapist, Judy King, has facilitated the camp since 2016 and said grandparents were often the ""forgotten mourners"" when a child had a life-limiting illness. ""We were noticing how important grandparents were in the scheme of things,"" she said. ""And there was a lot of support for mums, the dads, for siblings, and it's almost like the grandparents are the forgotten mourners. ""There's an extra level of grief for them. ""They're grieving for what their son or daughter is going through, and for their grandchild."" Bear Cottage will turn 21 this year. It is the only children's hospice in New South Wales and is part of the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network. It offers end-of-life and respite services for children who are very ill, as well as ongoing support to families. Ms King said it was often grandparents who rose to the challenge of looking after siblings and caring for a sick child and their parents. ""There's not always a lot of support for them. There is a generational thing of 'We just get on with it',"" she said. ""They don't always reach out. ""They look after everybody else and do not always look after themselves. And so we really try to provide a space where they can share."" Grandparent Don Wheeler and his wife Christine moved to Sydney from Brisbane when their grandson Levi was diagnosed with a brain tumour and given nine to 12 months to live. ""I think we just wanted to be here to do as much for Ben and Kath [Levi's parents] as we could,"" he said. Levi passed away at Bear Cottage on New Year's Eve in 2018. The family has channelled its energies into Levi's Project, which raises funds for research into the rare brain tumour Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). Mr Wheeler said the family talks about Levi every day to keep his memory alive. ""Grief is something that you'll never get over. It will always be there,"" he said. Joanne Gallen is the grandmother of 10-year-old Xavier — who has a number of ongoing medical challenges and uses Bear Cottage regularly for respite — and has now been to three of the camps. ""You can say things that you can't say to your children and you share things that you think are very dark, but it's really hard to open up with other people that don't understand what you're going through,"" she said. Ms Gallen said the medical support at the cottage allowed the family to simply enjoy Xavier and their other children. ""It's a place where the family can relax and have time out from the hard caring of a palliative care child. They're fantastic,"" she said. The camp is an opportunity for grandparents to take some of the load off, according to Ms King. ""I often see grandparents be really brave and stoic, and because they just want to support their child, and they want to support their grandchild and the other grandchildren,"" she said. ""There's sometimes some guilt … there's sometimes some anger, although that's not usually shown. ""This is the space where we allow that."" Watch this story on 7.30 on ABC TV and ABC iview.

30,Charge of intimidating witness dropped against Integrity Care director connected with Ann Marie Smith's death,health,"  Charge of intimidating witness dropped against Integrity Care director Philip Greenland in connection with Ann Marie Smith's death For the latest flood and weather warnings in Queensland, search on ABC Emergency Police have dropped charges against a former director of NDIS provider Integrity Care for threatening a key witness in an investigation into the death of Adelaide woman Ann Marie Smith. Prosecutors in the Adelaide Magistrates Court formally withdrew the charge against Philip John Greenland, saying they would no longer pursue the allegation. Police are still proceeding with an aggravated assault charge against the 57-year-old Huntfield Heights man after he allegedly spat in the witness's face at a service station last year. Ms Smith died in April 2020 from severe septic shock, malnutrition, multiple organ failure and other complications from her cerebral palsy while she was in full-time care. Police believe she was confined to a cane chair inside her Kensington Park home for 24 hours a day in the year leading up to her death. The 54-year-old lived alone and relied on an Integrity Care support worker for all of her needs. That carer, Rosa Maria Maione, is now behind bars, after she pleaded guilty in July last year to Ms Smith's manslaughter. Maione's former employer, Integrity Care SA, was fined more than $12,000 by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission for failing to report Ms Smith's death. The Quality and Safeguards Commission is also taking separate civil action against the company. Mr Greenland's matter will be referred to the Christies Beach Magistrates Court in July.
