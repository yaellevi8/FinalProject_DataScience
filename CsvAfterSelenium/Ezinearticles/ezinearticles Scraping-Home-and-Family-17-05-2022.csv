0,My Ongoing Grudge With Santa,Home-and-Family,"
					I've had sort of a grudge with old Mr. Santa Claus. I was introduced to Santa Claus by my parents, who informed me that he was the one that brought all of my Christmas presents on Christmas day. And I believe my parents. I remember on Christmas Eve we had to go to bed early to give Santa Claus time to deliver our presents under the tree. It was hard to sleep that early on Christmas Eve knowing that Santa was coming with Christmas presents. Finally, we did fall asleep only to wake up Christmas day with the tree filled with our Christmas presents. I did not know the real identity of Santa Claus until many years later. I was six years old when my parents first took me to see Santa Claus. I stood in the line and waited my turn to climb up on his lap and tell him what I wanted for Christmas. That first Christmas time, I told Santa that all I wanted for Christmas was a pony. Just a pony.				"

11,I Love My Imperfections,Home-and-Family,"
					Unlike most people, I love my imperfections; those imperfections of mine do not cause me much trouble. I know most people like to focus on their perfections so that they can impress other people. But what about people like me who have no perfections to boast about? If I had one perfection, I would spend all my time talking about that. And, that would become rather boring in no time. Some people are ashamed of their imperfections and try to hide them. They think for some reason their imperfections bring them down. Therefore, they do all they can to hide their imperfections from everybody, thinking that nobody will know anything about them. For the longest time, I tried to do that myself. Then there came the day when I realized that most people could see past my fa√ßade and see my imperfections.				"
12,"Hey, This Is My Story!",Home-and-Family,"
					I am just now concluding that narcissism is a virus that has infected everybody in the world that is breathing air. I even apply this to my own life with a great deal of regret. Nobody wants to admit they have narcissistic leanings in their life. And yet, if you listen to them, and even listen to yourself, you will see it. I did not know how aggravating it was, but I was to learn pretty soon. Recently I had a heart attack and had a stent put in one of my arteries, the widow make her. It was this experience that showed me the level of narcissism in my own life. When anybody would call me and ask how I was, I would mention that I recently had a heart attack and had a stent inserted in one of my arteries. Before I can even get to the end of that sentence, the person on the other end of the line will say, ""Oh, a couple of years ago, I had a heart attack and had two stents put in."" And then they would go on and on and on about their condition and experience.				"
13,"\""Eating Healthy Is for Sissies""",Home-and-Family,"
					As a youngster, I often heard my father say things that later turned out not to be on the true side of the table. So I guess that is a father's prerogative, and I probably have done the same thing many times. But I don't want to research that aspect of my life right now. One that he said quite often was, ""Eating healthy is for sissies."" At the time, I had no idea what he was talking about, but I did know that good old mom worked very hard to make sure he had healthy food to consume. So she did her job, but he did not fare well with that. He always ate in the opposite of healthy, and that just was the way he was. Later in life, he had diabetes, high blood pressure, clogged arteries and finally, several heart attacks. Then he died. According to him, these things had nothing whatsoever to do with his eating. They were just things that happened and he had no control over them.				"

In the Indian culture, Bhabhis are considered as motherly figures and thus when a sister ties a Rakhi to his brothers, she also ties one to the brothers as well.				"

					Usually, I am not easily offended, nor do I easily lose my temper. I did lose my temper when I was six years old but have not been able to find it since. Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage is trying to find it but so far, she has not found it. Many people are ticked off by some minor little thing it really does not amount to much. For example, driving through a fast food drive-in, you will realize what getting ticked off is all about. The customer in front of me is so impatient, and the customer behind me is just as impatient. They want everything on their schedule. Setting in the middle, I just relax because there is no way I can speed up the line so why try. Very few things offend me, and I have found it to be a very good practice.				"

0,I Can Never Have Too Much Ice Cream,Home-and-Family,"
					It was one of those hectic weeks that flew by, and I didn't know it until the end of the week. Friday night at supper time, it was one of those sneaky crashes. But, unfortunately, all the energy during the week had been pushing both of us forward, and we had no options but to keep plowing ahead. I don't know about other people, but I don't know I'm being pushed until the push is over. And Friday is the time for that push accounting. It was a quiet dinner because both of us had pushed the limits of exhaustion. Then, during the week, something happened and put us behind just when we thought we had caught up. Getting behind sometimes is not a choice and has a way of sneaking up on you and catching you off guard. I had come to the point where I had enough. Enough is enough; let's get on with life.				"
1,I Didn't Do It My Way,Home-and-Family,"
					I don't think I've learned very much during my life. I just bounce from day to day and take what comes. The one thing I did learn as I look back is, for the most part, I didn't do it my way. Remember Frank Sinatra and his song, ""I Did It My Way?"" I would have liked to ask him, how's that been working for you? Whenever we do everything our way, there is a consequence. You know what they say that for every action, there is a consequence. By the time the consequence hits you in the face, it's too late to make any changes. When I ever did something ""my way,"" it never really worked out.				"

3,Green Thumb Versus Black and Blue Thumb,Home-and-Family,"
					If you came to our parsonage, you would discover all over our property, plants and flowers. Just don't ask me to identify what they are. I can tell a plant from a flower, but that's as far as it goes with me. That is not true with the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. She gets all the credit for all the plants and flowers on our property. She knows them all by name. But, of course, I'm not sure if she's making up those names because I couldn't tell one plant from another plant. Walking up to our house, you will see right next to the door a pineapple plant. I never knew exactly what it was, but my wife kept telling me it was a pineapple. Then this year, the pineapple actually developed. It took several years for it to get to this stage. It has grown quite a bit during this year. Looking at it, you would think you were in Hawaii. When she first planted it she asked me, ""Did you see my new plant out front?"" I did not, but I did not want to tell her that I did not.				"
4,What Would Life Be Without Mistakes?,Home-and-Family,"
					Let me be clear from the beginning. I have made a lot of mistakes during my life. I have made mistakes that I don't even know about to this day. Even the ones I do know about, I cannot remember very clearly. Mistakes are a part of life. Unfortunately, some people believe they live their whole life without making any mistakes. That's mistake number one. I am where I am today because of the mistakes in my life. I have learned a lot from my mistakes, except I have not learned not to make any more mistakes. If somebody has not made mistakes in life, I would have to give that award to the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. Perhaps the closest she has ever come to making a mistake was in marrying me, but that certainly was not my mistake at all. Marrying her was the best choice I have ever made in life. I suppose she does make mistakes, but she knows how to fix them before anybody notices them. I wish I knew how she does that.				"

7,I Don't Believe in Karma,Home-and-Family,"
					Some people believe in karma, but I don't. Some people believe what you do will come back on you some way or the other. I do believe that everything you do does have consequences. Sometimes those consequences are small and insignificant and sometimes rather large and unbearing. Recently, my truck was in the garage for about six weeks getting a new engine because the old engine had died. That was the longest time I've been separated from my truck in, I don't know how many years. It was either get a new engine or a new truck. The engine was a lot cheaper. While my truck was in the shop, I used the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage's van. Believe me when I say it was a challenge to drive that little van. It was difficult for me to get in and out, and once I was in, it was hard for me to move about. I had no choice. Either borrow my wife's van or walk.				"
8,Life's Dessert,Home-and-Family,"

9,The Epitome Of Boredom,Home-and-Family,"
					I have never considered myself to be boring. I may be boring to other people but not to myself. As you get older, you find out that there are many boring things in this world. When younger, I can't ever remember being bored except when my father was lecturing me on how I should behave. I'm not sure he was very successful at that. I wasn't bored with anything, and I always found something to gain my attention. This was back in the day when there was no Internet, cell phones, or anything along those lines. How some people today live without cell phones is something I'll never understand.				"
10,Adoption Single Woman,Home-and-Family,"
					Adoption is open to any boy who is ready for it. There is no restriction as long as you are ready to love and care for the child. The numbers of single women hopping to adopt a baby is increasing tremendously. Some people may have believed that it is only the married men and women are supposed to adopt. That is not true when you are sure you can fend for the child, then you are eligible to adopt. The very truth is that so many single women of all ages are in search of a child to adopt.				"

					LOVE usually refers to an experience one person feels for another.Love often involves caring for,or identifying with a person or thing including oneself. A person can be said to love someone, object,principle or goal to which they are deeply committed. Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon.				"
13,"Ready or Not, Here I Quit",Home-and-Family,"
					I do not quit easily. When I start a project, I like to work until it's finished. I hate to quit before something is completed. One thing I have learned through the years is not to start something unless I have the time and resources to finish it. How many projects I started in the past and somehow ran out of steam or resources and never got to finish it. When I start a project, I am obsessed with finishing it on time. My problem is I have difficulty planning, scheduling and balancing certain projects. I often take on more than I could possibly do. Such is not the case with the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. Whatever she takes on and how much she takes on can always be finished on time. How she does it is beyond my understanding. The only project I can finish on time is eating. I have no problem finishing this project every day.				"
14,Getting Ready for Fall?,Home-and-Family,"
					With such a tumultuous summer, I'm glad we are now beginning the fall season. There for a while, I didn't think it was going to come. But, contrary to my negativity, it has arrived, and I'm delighted. Summer wasn't quite the way summers have been in the past. My family didn't have many get-togethers and picnics like we normally do. However, we did have one, and that had to do for the summer. I'm hoping next summer we can catch up. I remember when I was young, summer was a wonderful time. But, of course, maybe my memories are more wonderful than it actually was. At my age, you can't always depend upon your memory. But then, it goes the other way as well. I am so old that nobody can contradict any memories I might have. So I won't say that I lie, but I do have a way of stretching the truth, just a little. And by just a little, I mean just enough to make it look better than what it actually was.				"

16,Hallelujah... She's Baaaaack,Home-and-Family,"
					I have learned that you don't miss something until it is gone. Unfortunately, sometimes, it's too late. Over six weeks ago, or was it nine months, I took my truck in for a regular checkup. I was going away for the week, so I thought I would drop the truck off and let them work on it when they had time, and then when I come back, it would be ready. I love it when a plan comes together? My family went up to Georgia for a family reunion. It was also a time to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. Time goes by when we're not really focused on what's happening. That's me to a T. I took it in on Monday, then we left for our family reunion, and on Tuesday, the machine shop called me with some rather sad news. The engine in my truck was just about finished. So I had a choice of getting a new engine or buying another truck.				"
17,Is Being Sane Too Much to Ask?,Home-and-Family,"
					When young, I remember my grandfather often saying to me, ""the world wasn't like this when I was your age."" Then he would go on a long rant about how things were much different when he was my age. Finally, he would conclude by saying, ""It's an insane world out there, son."" I can't remember all he said, but one thing was when he was young, people were rather sane and the things they did. He explained it to me to the best of his ability, and I listen to the best of my ability. But then, sane to one person can be insanity to another. Recently, I caught myself saying the same things to one of my grandchildren, and then it dawned on me, ""Have I become my grandfather?"" Pondering this a little bit, I thought, is this generation just as insane as my generation? Or, where did this generation inherit their insanity? Looking at the culture around us, it's hard to see anything with any sense of sanity. Trying to listen to contemporary music is crazy. Not only can I hardly understand the lyrics, but they don't make sense.				"
18,And Then There Were Four,Home-and-Family,"
					Over a year ago, I got out of bed, went to the kitchen for my morning cup of coffee and then I went to the back porch to see if I had any visitors. I have foxes, possums, cats, and raccoons (who are politically correct and wear masks when they come). I put food out for them, and they help themselves. Every morning the food dishes are empty and waiting to be filled. It's great at night to look out and see some of these critters coming in for their evening snack. This morning, as I looked out, I saw a little kitty on the porch. I had no idea where this little kitty came from or how it got to our back porch. I opened the door, stepped out, and the little kitty ran and hid. She thought she was hiding, but I could see exactly where she was So I left her alone and went and got some food for her. I put it in the dish and stood there waiting for her to come over, instead, she sat there, looked at me, then looked at the dish and then looked back at me.				"
19,What's All These Gadgets For?,Home-and-Family,"
					Without any hesitation, I will gladly admit that I am on the short side when it comes to gadgets. For me, most of them do not make any sense at all. Instead, I like things simple and easy. As for the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage, she is obsessed with gadgets. She loves them almost as much as I love Apple Fritters. I've gone into her ""Craft Room"" and noticed all the gadgets neatly placed where they belong. Unfortunately, I could not tell you the identification of any of them. I am gadgets-illiterate while she is gadget-obsessed. I did not know how obsessed she was with gadgets until recently. My truck was giving me some trouble, so I took it to my mechanic to look it over. Much to my distress, he said the engine was just about shot, and it would have to be replaced. My choices were to replace the engine for around $5,500 or buy another truck for about $30,000. I may not be handy with gadgets, but when it comes to money, that is my specialty.				"

0,Temptation Is Oh So Tempting,Home-and-Family,"
					At the beginning of the week, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage informed me that she and some of her friends would be going thrift store shopping on Thursday. I nodded my head and smiled, not knowing where she was going with this. ""Now,"" she said, ""you will have to take care of your lunch. You think you can do that?"" I was smiling so hard on the inside I could hardly keep it from my face. ""Well,"" I said as calmly as possible, ""I think I can take care of it. No problem."" That meant I could eat my lunch when I wanted to eat it. My wife is very strict with rules and regulations. Everything has to be done at a certain time and in a certain way. Thursday morning, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said, ""Do you remember what's going to happen today?"" Did I remember? How in the world could I ever forget?				"

2,Free Range Children,Home-and-Family,"
					On the subject of children, opinions fly quick and sharp. Why is that? A child is your future; all of your hopes and dreams live on through your child. Most of us form a basis on how to raise our children from our parents. But, suppose that there was a break in human history on how parenting should be practiced.				"
3,Don't Judge a Person by Their Cover-Up,Home-and-Family,"
					Have you ever had one of those D√©j√† vu moments? The other week I was in the shopping mall to pick up some items for the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. She shops so much that I have to help her on occasion. On this occasion, I was walking down the mall and stopped dead in my tracks. Coming at me was someone that looked like my old aunt Elsie. She had the same hairdo, wearing the same clothes, and I was shocked because aunt Elsie died over 20 years ago. I did have a moment of temptation that I wanted to go up and ask her if she was aunt Elsie. I feared that she would answer me, ""Yes, and what's that to you?"" That would have convinced me that it was indeed aunt Elsie. I just let her walk by and tried not even to glance in her direction. Aunt Elsie was one of the relatives in my family that goes way back. Once you met her, you would never forget her for shore. What you thought of her the first time you met her was not who she really was.				"
4,I Ain't 16 Anymore,Home-and-Family,"
					I've had so many birthdays in my life that I really don't know how old I am. All I know is that I'm one year older than I was last year. I would not be able to remember when my life began if it wasn't for paperwork.. As I look forward to another birthday, I would like to go back to being 16 again. Those were the good old days, as they say. When I was 16, I was rather oblivious of things that were happening in the world. We didn't have TV back then and only got a TV when President J. F. Kennedy was assassinated. Dad had to get a TV to keep up with what was going on. I had no internet, computer, cell phone, video games or anything of the like. So in all actuality, I was on my own. One thing that really impressed me about being 16 was that I could get a driver's license and drive a car. The disappointing aspect about this was, I didn't have enough money to buy a car and so had to borrow my father's car when it was convenient for him. Oh boy, those were the days.				"
5,The Blossoming Flower Whisperer,Home-and-Family,"
					When it comes to flowers, I am the epitome of naivety. I have no expertise whatsoever in the plant world. All I see are red, blue and yellow. Don't get me wrong here; I enjoy flowers. However, when it comes to names, I am off the planet. I don't need to know the name of a flower to really enjoy that flower. Instead, I enjoy the fragrance and the optics of a row of flowers. If I had to take care of flowers, they wouldn't last more than 24 hours. Just because you like something doesn't mean you know how to take care of something. On the other side of this marital relationship, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage is quite the expert when it comes to plant life and developing flowers. She grew up on a farm, and her father was a farmer, so she understands how to take care of plants.				"

8,Where Oh Where Is My Hair?,Home-and-Family,"
					I must confess I sometimes get so busy that certain things have slipped my mind. I don't do this intentionally, but I try to prioritize things in my life. With so many things going on, it is tough to keep up-to-date with everything, even personal items. This is not true with the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. No matter how busy her day is, she always keeps up with everything. She knows things that are happening a week before they actually happen. How she does that, I don't know, and trust me, I am not going to inquire. I just ask her if I want to know something, and I get the latest on everything. So, why should I waste my time trying to keep up with everything? Maybe I should take her to the horse races this week and ask her today who's going to win. Looking at my driver's license, I believe I have a birthday coming up this month. I'm not sure exactly which one it is, but someone in our residence will inform me of that information when it comes time.				"
9,Any Pie √† La Mode Is My Kind of Pie,Home-and-Family,"
					Choices are a very important part of our everyday life. I am what I am today because of choices I made yesterday. I would like to blame someone else, but the truth of the matter is, I am what I am because of my choices. I must confess that there are a lot of bad choices I have made throughout my life. I will not name them right here, in fact, I'm trying to forget most of them. It's a good thing I can't relive yesterday. However, I have made a few choices that I have made in my life that has been very good. I don't focus on my bad choices because I can get discouraged. But, I do focus on my good choices because that's a real source of encouragement. I must say that the best choice that I've ever made in my life was marrying the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. I'm really not sure it was my choice, but I will take credit for it. While we were dating, we were once traveling with a group of people, and as we were sitting together, she said something like, ""Wouldn't it be nice to get married?""				"

					Life can get crazy because there are so many crazy people in the world. I know, I'm one. Through the years, I have come to appreciate crazy people. They make life interesting and make me look less crazy than I really am. The interesting thing is that a crazy person shows up in your life when you least expect it. There's no way you can prepare for these crazy episodes. If only I could wear a camera on my glasses, I could make a fortune. The other day I drove through the McDonald's drive-through to order my morning cup of coffee to take to my office. Of course, I do that every morning as a routine. This morning was rather a stressful kind of a morning, and I had a schedule I wanted to complete for the day. So I was thinking about what I was going to do as I was driving through the drive-through. In front of me was a blue car and a lady driving it.				"

					I must confess that I'm not always obvious to everything that is before me. I admit I miss a lot of things set before me. I don't do this intentionally. For example, sometimes, when I come home from the church office, I pass the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage, and she is waving at me, but I don't see her. When I get home, she confronts me about it. I know it happened because, well, she told me it happened. I wasn't very obvious of the situation at the time. Some things I see, some things I don't see. And I'm not sure the difference between either one. I don't know why I miss some things and not others. But I do, and I guess that's part of my personality. I know I have ten toes, five on each foot, and one on each foot is a big toe. I have known that since I could recognize things. I will not tell you how long that is because my calculator doesn't go up that high.				"
15,Where Do Wrinkles Come From?,Home-and-Family,"
					Several months ago, I had two cataracts removed from my eyes. How they got there, I don't know. As far as I can remember, they never asked my permission, and furthermore, they never paid rent for being there. According to the eye doctor, and doctors are never wrong, I now have 2020 vision. I've never had such vision since I was ten years old. All I really need now are reading glasses, and my vision is quite good. That sounds like a good thing on the surface, but every good thing has a little dark corner somewhere hidden. The good part is that I can see excellently. The bad part is that I can see excellently. I didn't quite understand this until just recently it came to full view.				"
16,Will We Be Served Coffee in Heaven?,Home-and-Family,"
					The last several weeks have truly been hectic in every sense of the word. Trying to catch up can be a never-ending job. When I think I'm caught up, I see another thing I need to do. I have learned that kicking the can down the street only hurts your big toe. With so much to do lately, it's hard to prioritize what should come first. The one thought rattling through my brain is, will anybody know if I don't do this job? It doesn't have to rattle too long before I come to the answer to that inquiry. If I don't do a certain job, the one who will know would be the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. When it comes to activities, she is the queen of priority and completion. I don't have that kind of initiative, but I certainly try. I have discovered that one day a certain activity will have priority; the next day, something else will have priority. Life can be very confusing, especially to someone like me trying to sort out priorities every day.				"
17,It's My Tongue I'll Wag It If I Want To,Home-and-Family,"
					Like everybody else, I have my share of trouble. It's not that I want to get into trouble, but trouble always seems to be somewhere near where I am at the time. I regret that time when I was first introduced to trouble. Some trouble I can't prevent. It just happens, and no matter what I do, trouble is in the room. I don't think there's anything I can do about that, but I hope the trouble will not be that bad. I know some people in my family get into trouble on purpose. The grand goal of their life is to get into trouble on a variety of levels. Back in the day, when we had family reunions, this person, which will remain anonymous, did everything he possibly could to make trouble. Most of the family just ignored him and forgot what he was doing. He wanted to be remembered as the family troublemaker. Actually, he was remembered as the family Goofball.				"
18,From 1950s 'Domestic Goddess' To Modern Day Maverick: How Cleaning Routines Have Changed Over Time,Home-and-Family,"
					Taking care of the space we call home is human nature. There is evidence that as early as Neanderthal times we were decorating our caves with ornaments, and painting on walls to share stories and entertain loved ones.    Nowadays, we are more likely to be fending off unwanted phone calls than a predator in the wild, but our drives when it comes to our home remain the same.				"

1,Those Discouraging Phone Call,Home-and-Family,"
					One day this past week, I decided to stay home and catch up on a little bit of reading. It's not often that I take a day and not go to the office and just pander around the house. Sometimes it's necessary to do such a thing, and I don't do it often enough. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage had a day planned of shopping as well as an appointment at her doctor. She would be gone the whole day, and so I would have the entire day to myself. I was looking forward to it. Who wouldn't? I really was mistaken about this idea. For me to have a day by myself is a wonderful idea, but it's still back in Kansas. The wife just left the building, I had settled down with a stack of books I needed to go through and, of course, a hot cup of coffee to the left of me. I was looking forward to a wonderful day. I sighed a deep sigh and opened up the first book. Then I got a phone call. I wasn't prepared for the phone call, so I answered, expecting to talk to someone.				"

3,"I May Be a Knucklehead, But I'm Not Insane",Home-and-Family,"
					Nobody is perfect except maybe the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage comes close. I've never caught her in some imperfection, or if I had, nobody would know it from me. There is such an obsession today for people to be perfect. And, of course, their definition of perfect is what they are. They judge everybody by themselves, which is insane in itself. Often my wife will catch me in something and say, ""Are you acting like a knucklehead?"" If only she knew I wasn't acting. The simple fact is, I don't know everything I'm supposed to know. I don't know what I'm not supposed to know. It gets rather confusing after a while, and it slips over into the area of knuckleheadhood. When it comes to fixing things, I am the classic knucklehead. If something is broken, I can make it more broken in just a few minutes. If the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage sees something broken, she can fix it in the twinkling of an eye. I married her because of that twinkle in her eye. At the time I didn't know what it really meant.				"
4,Wrestling With God (2),Home-and-Family,"
					""But during the night Jacob got up and sent his two wives, two concubines, and eleven sons across the Jabbok River. After they were on the other side, he sent over all his possessions. This left Jacob all alone in the camp and a man came and wrestled with him until dawn. When the man saw that he couldn't win the match, he struck Jacob's hip and knocked it out of joint at the socket. Then the man said, 'let me go, for it is dawn.' But Jacob panted, 'I will not let you go unless you bless me.' 'What is your name?' The man asked, he replied, 'Jacob.' 'Your name will no longer be Jacob,' the man told him. 'It is now Israel, because you have struggled with both God and man and have won.' 'What is your name? Jacob asked him. 'Why do you ask?' the man replied, then he blessed Jacob there.'Jacob named the place Peniel - 'Face of God' for he said, 'I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared.' The sun rose as he left Peniel.				"
5,Who Doesn't Like A Girl Scout Cookie?,Home-and-Family,"
					This week the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage made a little slip. To her, it was a little slip, but to me, it was a big mistake. It is not always that she makes mistakes that I can profit on. I don't make this public, especially within her earshot, but there are times that she makes a mistake, and I'm always on the lookout for those times. When it comes to me, I'm always making mistakes. I'm not sure that I can make a little slip because mine are much bigger. And the problem with this is, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage always catches them, and sometimes, I don't know how she does it, she catches them before I actually do them. She calls it ""woman's intuition,"" but I call it ""man's trouble."" This past week, for instance, I had an appointment with my eye doctor. I was to pick up my new glasses, and I was anxious about that. I told my wife that the doctor's appointment was on Wednesday. She countered that and said, ""No, I believe it's on Thursday.""				"
6,A Shortcut Is Not Always That Short,Home-and-Family,"
					I have always appreciated shortcuts in life. If I can find a shortcut, I will take it because time is valuable to me. I take pride in coming up with a shortcut that actually saves me time. However, not all of my shortcuts have really been that short and I have paid the price. Last week, for example, I had to go clear across town for my appointment with my eye doctor. Somehow I think they try to figure out where to place a doctor's office, so it isn't easy to get there, especially when there's a time element involved. My eye appointment went rather well, and I was happy with the results. I had made the appointment very close to the next appointment I needed on the other side of town. Have you ever noticed when you have two appointments on the same day, they are at the opposite ends of town? I hate that.				"
7,What Would the World Be Without Apple Fritters?,Home-and-Family,"
					Stress is not something new in my life or anybody else's, for that matter. The thing about stress is that you never get used to it, or at least I don't. I don't know what I would do if one week I had no stress at all. When that happens, I'll let you know. This past week has not been one of those stress-free weeks. Starting on the very first day of the week, stress poked its nose into my business. On Monday, as I sat at my office to begin the week's work, I opened up my laptop, and I could not turn it on. It would not accept my password. I've used that password for as long as I've had the computer. However, today it would not work. I tried everything, but nothing worked except it worked up my stress level. Finally, I had to take it to a computer store to fix it. It took them a little over an hour, but they finally fixed it. The tech also set it up so that I did not have to use a password to open up my computer. That eliminated a lot of stress.				"
8,That's Why Doctors Call Us Patients,Home-and-Family,"
					For the past month I have been engaging with my eye doctor. I've had two cataracts removed which isn't a serious thing in itself. But what goes into this surgery is what baffles me. I've often wondered why doctors call us patients. I have figured out that the doctors are not patient, so they expect us to be patient. I need to work on that. I had two cataract surgeries two weeks apart. It took a whole month to go through the process. After the surgery, it'll take another 4 to 6 weeks to get the proper glasses I need to read. Talk about being patient! However, needing this procedure, I had to take what came with it. I must say I am not more patient today than I was a month ago. The first time I went to the eye doctor, he scheduled me for a 9:15 appointment. No problem. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage got me there 15 minutes ahead of time to make sure I wouldn't be late.				"

Companies also need to think about work/life balance provisions like those for maternity leave, dependent care leave parental leave, and an increase in the level of rights for part-time workers. They realize that getting the right work-life balance for employees can lead to considerable payoffs in terms of employee retention, commitment, efficiency, quality of work, etc.				"
11,Something Seems to Be Missing,Home-and-Family,"
					Did you ever have a week when it felt like something was missing, but you didn't quite know what it was? I had that kind of a week this past week. It felt like something was missing, and I could not figure out what it was. The past week was typical in many regards. Everything seemed to be going normal as normal could be. But I had this nagging thought in the back of my head that I was missing something. I really couldn't get a handle on it. At first, I thought maybe I had missed my Apple Fritter. My New Year's resolution for this year was only to eat one Apple Fritter at a time. And as far as I can recollect, I have not missed one so far this year. So, it wasn't an Apple Fritter that I was missing. It was something, and it was beginning to get on my nerves. I got out my weekly planner to see if there was a meeting that I had missed or forgotten about. I went very carefully, and everything I was supposed to do this past week I did. And yet, something was missing.				"

14,"Ants, Ants, Where's the Uncles",Home-and-Family,"
					I have learned in my life that the small things are the ones that get you down. You would think the big things are the ones to steal most of your time. But those big things call attention to themselves from the very beginning. You know they're there, you know you have to do something about it, and so you do. The little things in life, usually unnoticed and ignored, cause most of the problems. Everybody has their definition of what a ""small problem"" really is. A small problem for me is finding the pen I need for a particular project. I have a different pen for each project, and I don't like to mix them up. Someone in the family thinks it's crazy for me to have that kind of a problem. But everybody is crazy in some way. Another small problem for me would be finding the right book to do some research for the day. Believe me, that small problem can become a huge problem towards the end of the day.				"
15,Seeing Can Be Rather Expensive,Home-and-Family,"
					As I get older, and my goal is to get as old as I can, I begin to realize some of the things I haven't noticed in my life. You know how it is; things creep up little by little, and then all of a sudden, there it is. That happened to me recently with my eyes. Since I was in the ninth grade (I will not disclose the year), I have been wearing glasses and have become used to wearing them. Every year I would have them upgraded, and the upgrade was little by little until if I took my glasses off, I couldn't see my real self. The advantage of that is, I don't wear my glasses when I look in the bathroom mirror. That saves me a lot of problems. What am I going to do what I can really see? About two years ago, when I was at the eye doctor, he noticed some things in my eyes. ""You have cataracts in both eyes.""				"

17,Be Careful What You Smile About,Home-and-Family,"
					I am a student of smileology and have been just about all my life. If you can't smile at something, it's not worth thinking about. Of course, certain things in life are serious, but not that many. Too many people take everything seriously and ruin their life. These are the kind of people I like to be around because they take things so seriously and because of that, the jokes on them. When I see somebody that looks sad, I have an impulse to try to do something to make them laugh. It is that smile on our face that defines who we are. There are times when I need to be careful about my smiling. I find so much to chuckle about, and to be truthful, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage has given me quite a bit to chuckle about. I don't know if she has taught me to chuckle or if I have taught her to chuckle. The result is the only thing that matters. We chuckle together, and that makes a good life. We need to be careful about watching programs dealing with politicians because of the danger of dying laughing.				"

If anybody knew how to squeeze a buffalo out of a nickel, it was my grandfather. But you couldn't trick him by offering him something free. He said to me, ""Son, if it's free, it ain't for me."" Explaining that, he said, ""For everything free, somebody, somewhere has to pay for it."" At the time, I just chuckled and fluffed off this advice. After all, if I'm offered something free I'm going to jump and even dance to get it. Getting something free wasn't too bad, and I tried to be careful about some of these free offers. But that was back in the day when there was no Internet or websites. Oh, those were the good old days.				"

If I try to fix something, I make it worse than it was. Fixing is not my strong suit. On the other side of the parsonage, we have a different scenario. If the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage cannot fix something, it cannot be broken. No matter what it is, it doesn't take her long to figure out how to fix it. Often she will spend time on the computer searching out a particular project and getting to know what needs to be done to fix it and get it up and running. I must say, and this is just between you and me, she has saved me quite a bit of money by fixing things up that would cost a lot to have them fixed at a professional place. If there is something wrong with my vehicle, I first present it to my wife. I have yet to find something broken in my vehicle that she cannot fix.				"

9,"Knock, Knock - Someone's in Trouble",Home-and-Family,"
					For some reason, the last several weeks we have been getting many visitors at our door. I'm not sure if this is a general trend or if it is just our door. Some of them have been salesmen, religious people, scam artists, and a host of other people. They only had one goal in mind, and that was to get our money. I guess I have not realized how wealthy I am. Everybody wants my money. If they only knew how little money I had, they would be running away from our house. I can't even get my money because I'm not sure where it is. This year the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I will have been married 50 years. I think my wife married me for my money, but in the last 50 years, she has not found any of it. I'll give her another 50 years, and then we are going to have to reexamine the situation. When she does find it, we will take a vacation to Hawaii. Money we have not, and the more they pester us for our money, the more frustration we acquire.				"

So, if you can't swindle me, you might as well hang it up and get a real job. I must confess I often know a certain person is trying to take advantage of me. But, that's another story. One problem I see is that people are always blaming someone else for their problems. I must confess I do that on occasion, probably more so than I will acknowledge. To blame someone else for my problem gets me off the hook, or so I think.				"
11,If It Was Up To Me,Home-and-Family,"
					Fifty years ago, I was a teenager. Boy, do I miss those Days of Yore. It's not that I would like to relive them, but I was a much different person back then. As a teenager, I knew everything, and all you had to do was ask me. Even if you didn't ask me, I still would tell you what was on my mind. I wished I knew everything today because people are asking me questions I can't even answer. A teenager is someone between being a baby and being an adult. I sure don't want to be a baby, and I've had misgivings about becoming an adult. An adult has all kinds of responsibilities, of which none define the term ""let's have fun."" One of the marvelous things about being a teenager is that you really don't know what's going on in the world. When I was a teenager, television wasn't the big thing it is today. And we didn't have the Internet with all of the social media associated with it. I could go a whole week and not know what was going on out in the world.				"

And for many people it is. However, after being married to the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage for almost 50 years, I have discovered that a divided house can be a very happy house. It just depends on how you are divided and what divides you. That makes all the difference in the house. Being married as long as I have been does not make me an expert in this area. I am only an expert in forbearance, which is the reason there is always a smile on my face. Whether you believe it or not, that smile is genuine.				"

					When I was young, my mother was quite a fan of a soap opera called ""The Days of Our Lives."" I remember the title but I never would watch something like that. However, my mother enjoyed it and so what's there to complain about. As I was thinking of it, I felt that I should remember the days of my life. But, instead of ""days,"" I need to put in the word ""daze,"" which more clearly represents my life. At times, I wish I was 16 again because I was the smartest person in the world. I knew everything; all you had to do was just ask me. Of course, back then, nobody asked me anything. When I got older, I realized that there were a lot of things I did not know. Like one of the FBI directors said, ""I don't know what I don't know."" I relate to that statement. How my life would change if I knew what I didn't know? Looking back, I must confess that my life has been primarily in a daze. I did not realize it. It wasn't until recently that I realized how much of my life was in a daze.				"
15,Coffee Without Coffee Just Ain't,Home-and-Family,"
					I must soberly confess that I have throughout my life given in to habits and rituals. I don't like saying that, but it is the truth. At this point, I don't know the difference between a habit and a ritual. One ritual I have is when I get up in the morning, the first thing I do is have a nice hot cup of coffee. This is what really gets me going in the morning. You do not want to meet me before I have my morning. There was a time I changed my habit and had hot tea in the morning. I thought that might be a different change in my life. Believe me when I say it was a change. You did not want to meet me after having my hot tea in the morning. In fact, I didn't even recognize myself after that hot cup of tea. Before we go to bed each evening, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage prepares the coffee pot to go off in the morning so it's ready when I get up. I'm not sure how many years she has done that, but she did it today, and that's all that counts.				"
16,Riding the Hallelujah Train To the End,Home-and-Family,"
					We had a long, hard week with problems and difficulties that took time to solve, if they even were solved. It is quite interesting to me that when I solve one problem, two other problems appear. I think they're all waiting in line. In particular, one day was rather difficult and zapped both of us of energy. I ordered a new desk for my office, and there were so many problems getting it delivered that I almost gave up. Along the way the desk was damaged and they returned it back to the store without even telling us. We had to reorder it all over again and wait for it. But then it came. Problem solved. That evening the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I sat down after supper to watch a little TV news and drink our evening coffee. We like to get caught up on the news of the day so we know what's happening. There is nothing like relaxing after a hard day's work and just getting a little bit of energy back into the system again, and at our age, that takes time of which we have little.				"
17,"Well, Here We Go Again",Home-and-Family,"
					I have lived long enough to know that the only change that has any kind of reality is the change in my pocket. I keep track of that change with great supervision and count it every day. When people tell me that this is a New Year and there will be a lot of changes this year, I search my pocket because that's the only change I want to know about. Looking back over my life, the most significant change that ever came to me was the day I said ""I do"" to the future Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. At the time, and it's good for me that I didn't know, I didn't know what ""I do"" really meant. Oh yes, I understood it had to do with marriage, but at that time, I had no idea what marriage was all about. I thought, as many of the songs tell me, love will conquer everything. All you need to do is have love, and that will be all you need. When I said, ""I do,"" my life changed like I never expected it to change. And mostly, I must admit, for the better. I have no complaints.				"
18,Red Isn't Always the Red I See,Home-and-Family,"
					It is not that I am colorblind; I just am color indifferent. Red and blue and yellow are all the same to me. This, on many occasions, has challenged the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage, who is very meticulous when it comes to describing anything or anyone. In remodeling my office at the parsonage my wife asked, ""What color would you like the walls to be painted?"" That sounds like a good question to ask but it's not any question to ask if you know me. ""I don't care about the color. Whatever you think is best is okay with me."" Thinking I had solved the problem, I felt at ease, but her response caused me to realize the problem had not been solved. ""It's your office,"" she said, ""what color would you like the walls to be painted?"" With that, she looked at me with a very gregarious smile, which is infectious to me. Knowing that she wouldn't stop until she got an answer from me I said, ""Paint the walls purple.""				"

0,Another Christmas Tree in the Bag,Home-and-Family,"
					It's hard to believe, but another Christmas has come and gone. It comes so slow but leaves so fast. I guess I'll never understand that. This Christmas was probably the most unusual that I have ever experienced. When I was young, I remember those first Christmases; they were so slow in getting here. I think for the week leading up to Christmas, every day gained at least 10 new hours. By the time Christmas Eve arrived, I was so worn out waiting that I didn't know what to do. I can't remember my first Christmas because I was only five months old at the time. I have a hard time remembering those early Christmases, but I'm sure they were times of fun and merriment. There were no cell phones at that time and so I have no selfies to show. The day after Christmas, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were sitting around the Christmas tree drinking our morning cup of coffee. Looking at the tree brought back a lot of memories for both of us. My memories are vaguer than hers, but after all, it's the memory the counts.				"
1,Dear 911 Dispatcher,Home-and-Family,"
					You and I may never meet in person, but know that your voice will be forever etched on my heart. It was just a few weeks ago that you received a call from a hysterical wife who heard her husband crash to the floor and realized that he wasn't breathing. Because of your training, your insight, your professionalism and your calming and persistent voice; somehow your voice and your words penetrated my brain; and my arms and hands that had never performed CPR took on a life of their own and followed your detailed instructions thereby making sure that he...				"
2,Tell Santa I Tried to Be Nice,Home-and-Family,"
					It's that time of the year when the conversation around the dinner table in the Parsonage has to do with naughty or nice. I must admit it's not my favorite conversation because what is naughty, and what is nice? That all depends on who you're talking to. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage has a different definition of these words than I do. According to my wife, nice has to do with broccoli, and naughty has to do with Apple fritter. I'm afraid I have to disagree with this because as far as I'm concerned, nice has to do with Apple fritter and naughty has to do with broccoli. I'm not sure that you can get any naughtier than broccoli. At least I can't. But this time of the year, the definition of naughty and nice is determined by some overweight guy living in the North Pole abusing reindeer. If you think I'm going to listen to his definition, you don't know me. I don't want Santa to determine if I'm naughty or nice because I don't trust that guy.				"
3,"Christmas Is More Than Jingle, Jingle",Home-and-Family,"
					I have been trying lately to remember my first Christmas. I know my memory isn't perfect, but I thought maybe I could bring up some old memories of my first Christmas. Unfortunately, I couldn't think of a thing about that first Christmas of mine. Of course, it might be that I was only five months old at the time. Still, I tried to remember some of those old Christmases in the past. Down through the years, I have celebrated more Christmases than I want to let on. It's not that I'm old; I just haven't died yet. The thing about Christmas was all the stuff I was getting. The first Christmas I remember, I got a bunch of presents under the tree. None of my siblings had shown up at the time, so I was the focus of several Christmases. That was the essence of real joy. I thought Christmas was all about me and all I wanted for Christmas and all that would make me happy.				"
4,It Was a Shoofly Pie Moment,Home-and-Family,"
					During holiday seasons, I enjoy indulging in special food. My favorite during this time of year is the Shoofly Pie. Nothing hits the spot quite like this. Although the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage restricts this kind of culinary activity during the rest of the year, I tried to get a pass for it during the holidays. I don't care what holiday it is, a holiday is a holiday and deserves special food. I don't remember when I had my first shoofly pie, I only focus on my next piece. When I first brought it into the home, my wife asked me what in the world it was. I told her it was a Shoofly Pie.. Looking at me rather quizzically, she said, ""What is a Shoofly Pie??"" Not even thinking about it, I smiled and replied, ""It is a piece of heaven this side of heaven.""				"

Here are some of the things that gardeners suggest that you have so that you can have an attractive garden at your new home.				"
7,It's All Over But The Lying,Home-and-Family,"
					The one thing I don't like is when somebody deliberately lies to me. Trust me; this has happened quite a few times in my life. Sometimes, by accident, they say something that isn't true; they just got their facts mixed up. Other times, it's a ploy to deceive me and get something from me. As I often say, if you can't con me you can't con anyone. I must say I have become very suspicious when somebody I don't know promises me something ""free."" If you follow through with these ""free"" things, it's like my aunt used to say, ""Sonny, there ain't nuthin free."" I'm sure my aunt would not lie to me.				"
8,Geriatrics-Hematuria Or Blood In Urine-Allopathy Cure - Consumption of Boiled Or Raw Radishes!,Home-and-Family,"
					Some geriatric persons have blood in urine. Doctors call it hematuria. The doctors prescribe 7 Cefdinir 300 mg capsules to be taken by mouth. As a patient of 83 years, having this condition, these capsules were like a god send and cleared up the blood in my urine. To sustain no blood in the urine successfully consuming raw radish slices or radish soup every day helps immensely, prevents loss of blood in old age.				"
9,Being Nice Does Have Its Rewards,Home-and-Family,"
					It was one of those weeks. It seems that every week of mine is ""one of those weeks."" Just when I think everything was looking fine, I discovered I was looking in the wrong direction. I should know better than thinking. Several problems developed with my vehicle, and I had to take it to the garage. Fortunately, when I took it in, it wasn't as serious as I thought it would be. Of course, I was happy about that, and as I drove my vehicle home, I sang one of my happy songs. The next day, the vehicle had the issue again. I guess he heard me sing that happy song and was going to try to prove me wrong. I should've worn a mask while singing so he wouldn't understand what I was singing. When am I going to learn? Oh well, it's one of those weeks. I took the vehicle back to the garage, and they solved the problem very quickly, which made me happy. Remembering the last time I brought the vehicle home, I did not sing my happy song, at least out loud.				"
10,Where's The Bug?,Home-and-Family,"
					As far back as I can remember, every time I would leave the house, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage would say, ""Be careful. Drive safely."" It's as though she doesn't think I could drive carefully without giving me some instructions. I think it has become just a routine for her. There are reasons behind all of that. I've been involved in quite a few accidents, although not serious. An accident can create a whole lot of trouble, especially with the insurance company. There have also been times I have run out of gas. When I have an accident, I have to call the insurance company. When I run out of gas, I have to call the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. One of those calls, and I will not say which one, I do not want to make. Although I've not had many accidents, they still are accidents. Although most of them were not my fault, I still got blamed.				"
11,When Everything Goes My Way,Home-and-Family,"
					I have had a certain dream many times over the years. Of course, it might lean towards being a nightmare if it does not come true. The dream is that one day in the week; I can have everything go my way. The nightmare part of that dream is that it never tells me which day everything will go my way. One morning I told the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage about my dream to see if she could give me any advice. ""Don't you remember,"" my wife said, ""that day was three years ago? You already had that day when everything goes your way."" That was as specific as she would get. She never would tell me which day it was that everything went my way. I am just a little bit suspicious about all of that. If I had a day where everything went my way, I certainly would have remembered it.				"

14,Things Have a Way of Catching Up With Me,Home-and-Family,"
					I have learned in my life, and probably just one thing: things have a way of catching up with me. I can't get away with anything. It's not that I don't try. There were a few times when I've come pretty close to getting away with something, but it didn't turn out the way I hoped. One example stands out. Last year someone hacked into the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage's bank account and purchased a case of wine for around $700. It took her a few days to see this in her bank account. When she saw it, she immediately went to the bank to dispute it. The interesting thing about this purchase on her account was, it happened while she was playing the piano in church on a Sunday morning here in Florida, and was made at the same time in Southern California. I know my wife is terrific, but I did not believe she could do that. To be in two different places at the same time is magical. Maybe she has more arrows in her quiver than I imagined.				"
15,The Alleged Warrant For My Arrest,Home-and-Family,"
					This past week was one of the best weeks I've had in a long time. I got everything completed, as well as some overdue projects. There's no feeling quite like the feeling of having accomplished your goals for the week. As far as I was concerned, this called for an Apple fritter celebration. Just keep this between us and don't let you-know-who hear. Driving home from my office, I was whistling and just enjoying myself while I was nibbling on my Apple fritter. My goal was to get it finished before I got home, and because of the week I was having, I finished that goal as well. When I walked into the house, I was met by the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage, and I noticed a rather serious look on her face. I thought maybe she had a bad day, and I was not going to let her bad day influence my good day. So I said, ""Hello, my dear. How has your day been?""				"

18,"All in Due Time, So She Says",Home-and-Family,"
					For several weeks, or has it been years, I've been waiting for an important package to come through the mail. I don't know why they call it snail mail because I have seen snails crawl faster. With all our technology today, you would think that mail could come in on a particular schedule, and I'm thinking of a fast-paced schedule. I've been going to the mailbox every day for several weeks, and I find a lot of junk mail, but I don't find the mail that I'm looking for. They promised it would arrive between seven and ten days. Of course, they didn't mention what days they would come, nor did they say those days would be consecutive. Each day that mail hasn't come has made me more jittery. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage is always encouraging me to be patient. I once responded to her, ""I'm not a doctor, and I don't have any patients.""				"
19,Junk Is a Matter of Personal Definition,Home-and-Family,"
					I thought I had everything organized and in order. It just shows how useless my thinking is these days. There are many piles in my office and on my desk, and I know what is in each pile. Everything is organized to my specifications. My rule is: if I can't find something, I don't need it. Believe me; there's a lot of things I don't need. At the end of the week, I was finishing up my office area and closing it down for the week. I sighed a deep sigh of relief, knowing that my work for the week was done. Nothing is more satisfying than when a plan comes together. It was at this point that the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage came into my office area and said rather strictly, ""What is all this junk?"" At first, I did not know what she was talking about. I looked around my office area, and I could not see any junk. So I asked her, ""What junk are you referring to?"" It was a very sane and insightful question, at least from my point of view.				"

1,Chillin Ain't What I Thought It Was,Home-and-Family,"
					Last week the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage came up with a brilliant idea. At least, at the time, it seemed brilliant. ""Why don't we,"" she began, ""take Monday off and just chill?"" Since it's been a long time since I did any chillin, I had to ask her, ""What do we chill about?"" She looked at me with one of those looks and said, ""Oh, silly boy. Don't you know what it means to just chill for a day?"" It's been so long since I did any of that I'm not sure if I remember what the rules are for chilling for a day. I can't remember the last time we did that. I'm sure being sick in bed does not qualify. ""Don't you worry about a thing,"" she said with a huge smile on her face, ""I'll take care of everything.""				"

3,"Oh, to Be Crazy and Get Paid for It",Home-and-Family,"
					I usually don't complain a lot. When I do I get caught in some dilemma that I can't talk my way out. You think I would learn my lesson, but I'm still in the learning curve. It was a long week, and the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I had a busy schedule. She went her way, I went my way and the Spousal Twain only meets after the week's work is done. Some weeks are better than others, but some aren't. And I was having a rather dismal week with a few things going wrong. For one, my vehicle needed to go to the garage to be fixed. I always fear taking my truck in for repairs because it usually ends up costing more than expected. However, this week, when I went to pick up my vehicle, it was only 1/3 of what I thought it would cost. I was happy. After all, who wouldn't be happy? I drove home in time for supper, and the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage had a wonderful supper prepared for us, and we enjoyed our time together.				"

I wish there were a class somewhere entitled, ""How You Can Get Away with Anything."" I certainly would sign up. But I haven't found it yet. Every time I do something behind the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage's back, she always turns around. I don't know if she has eyes in the back of her head or if it's just women's intuition. Believe me, I will not investigate this subject. The many times she has fooled me is beyond calculation. I am probably the easiest person to fool in all the world. A salesman, I am not. As a kid, I made little dishes out of popsicle sticks. Then I went around the neighborhood to try to sell them. My sales pitch was, ""You don't want to buy one of these, do you?"" I didn't sell any.				"

12,A Musical Concert or Aggravating Noise?,Home-and-Family,"
					To say the least, and I usually do, this summer has been quite a journey for the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and myself. I can't remember a summer equal to the one we just went through. The fact that we got through it is amazing. We have been staying at home more often than usual, but I'm not complaining. What better night than the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and me sharing whatever we are doing? One night this past week, I turned off the TV; we were getting ready to go to bed when my wife said, ""What is that aggravating noise?"" I didn't know what she was talking about. I asked her to tell me what noise she was referring to. ""Listen,"" she whispered, ""don't you hear that noise?"" I must say one of my problems is that although I listen, I most often don't hear. There is supposed to be a connection between listening and hearing, but it doesn't always work with me. I guess I'm wired differently than my wife.				"
13,If Only My Fishing Rod Could Talk,Home-and-Family,"
					It has been a busy week, more so than any other week. Just when I thought I was caught up, something else presented itself without my permission. That seems to be what life is all about. I remember my father telling me when I complained to him how busy my life was and how my employer wanted me to do a lot of work, ""Son, that's life. To be sure, he was right. My father has been right many times, and if only I would have listened to him, I would not have experienced some of the problems that I did. Just don't let him know I said that. In the middle of trying to sort out my mess this week, I sat back in my chair, took a deep sigh, and then noticed my old fishing rod in my office corner. It has been there ever since we moved into this house. I forgot that it was there, and as I looked at it, I remembered some of the times I had with that old fishing rod.				"

As I was preparing for this little adventure, my wife looked at me and said, ""What are you putting in that bag?"" I looked at her, smiled and said, ""I'm putting some projects that I want to catch up on while we're on vacation."" I then flashed another smile in her direction. ""This is going to be wonderful,"" I said to her. She looked at me, both hands on her hips and said, ""You are not taking any projects on this trip. The whole plan is for us to do nothing. Do you understand?"" I must say I was not quite prepared for this. When we got away, I thought I could spend time catching up on some projects I was working on.

3,"What It Was, Was a Peach Tree",Home-and-Family,"
					For some reason, this week, I had been thinking of my maternal grandfather. I was named after him, and therefore we had a connection. I was thinking about him because this month I turned the same age as he was when he passed. I hope there's no connection there. As a young boy, I would spend a month, every summer at my grandparents. They lived up in the mountains of Pennsylvania in a long valley. My grandfather was a farmer, and his primary income was his dairy cows. He taught me how to milk cows, and he did it the old-fashioned, hands-on way. My grandfather and grandmother were rather opposite. My grandfather was rather quiet and didn't talk very much. On the other hand, my grandmother never had an unexpressed thought. I guess she made up for my grandfather's silence. But my grandfather was quite different, a very quiet individual. I remember one afternoon sitting on the front porch with his brother, Dan. The three of us sat there, and the conversation went something like this.				"

					Some people say we are living in the ""new normal."" I'm not sure exactly what they mean, and I don't have the time to ask, nor the desire. If the ""new normal"" is what I have been experiencing in the parsonage for the last several months, I'm all for it. Let it continue. Everybody should be able to live their own normal. Because of being limited, as far as traveling is concerned and going shopping or whatever, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I have spent a lot of time at home enjoying our time together. I must say that my wife and I don't always see eye to eye. After all, I'm 6'3"", and she's only 5'2"". I'm tempted to say at times, but I value my life too much, that I have a ""higher perspective"" than my wife. But you didn't hear it for me. We have spent almost half a century together, and we're coming out of it most amicably. Some people might say we were opposites in many regards. She's on the vegetable side of the table, and I'm on the fruit side.				"
6,I Love a Mystery When It's a Mystery,Home-and-Family,"
					Because of the situation we are in these days, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I have spent some significant time watching mysteries. We enjoy a mystery movie. I have always loved mysteries. I have read all of the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. I have read the Father Brown stories by G. K. Chesterton. And, don't forget Agatha Christie with Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. What wonderful mysteries created by these authors, and I have enjoyed reading the books as well as watching the movies based on these books. I especially like those stories where the mystery is a challenge to figure out until the very end. That keeps me on edge as I follow the story. Usually, I figure out wrong. I would never make a great detective; that is for sure. The person I think is guilty is often the most innocent person at the end of the story. However, I keep trying, and I enjoy figuring out who the guilty person is. That is not the case with the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage.				"
7,It's My Birthday I'll Lie If I Want To,Home-and-Family,"
					I'm not a proponent of lying. I don't like it when people lie. If they lie once, how do you know they're not lying again? Lately, I've been thinking about what the definition of a lie really is. Is there some time when telling a lie is the best to do? And, is every lie a non-truth? The reason I've been having these thoughts is that I just celebrated my birthday. It always sneaks up on me, and I'm not sure why because it happens every year. It was like when I was in school, we always had a test on Friday, and it always surprised me that the teacher had a test. So my birthday this year was somewhat of a surprise because I was so busy doing other things I forgot about it. Having a birthday every year can be a little monotonous. One good thing about my birthday is that the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage's birthday is two days after mine. And so, if she remembers my birthday, then I will automatically remember hers. I love it when a plan comes together.				"

Or perhaps you already have a fire extinguisher sitting in your garage or kitchen area, and you're afraid to take the first steps in learning how to use it. You're fearful that it will explode before your eyes or create some kind of irreversible mess or damage.				"
10,If I Had a Nickel for Every Blunder I Made,Home-and-Family,"
					I am not very agile when it comes to finances. Do not get me wrong, I know how to spend money; it is just that I do not know how to save money. Somewhere I lost my little piggy bank. One of my father's favorite quotes was, ""A penny saved is a penny earned."" It never made sense to me, but my father knew how to save money. On the other side, he was not very agile when it came to spending money especially on me. My whole life has never been focused on making money. For me, the outdoor was busier than the indoor with money. I must confess my wife and I have struggled throughout our life on the financial side. On the relational side, we have done wonderfully; at least that is my impression. I know some marriages seem to be based upon finances, even though they will not admit it. Their finances determine how successful they really are in their mind.				"

12,It's Not Always What It Seems,Home-and-Family,"
					There are times when my bad hearing is a blessing. I'm not sure if I'm not listening or not hearing. It's hard for me to tell. For example, the other night, right after midnight, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were pretty much sound asleep. There was more sound on the other side of the bed than on mine, but that's a different story. There was this tremendous boom, several flashes of lightning, and the rooftop was bombarded with rain. It sounded like some invasion. I didn't hear it when it happened, but my wife shook me radically and asked, ""What's that noise?"" Being the veteran husband that I am, I don't jump to an answer unless I fully understand the question. In the middle of the night, there is no way I'm going to understand anything. That's just the way it is.				"

15,It Only Takes Two To Get Married,Home-and-Family,"
					My mom and dad were married on July 4, 1951. That morning mom went shopping for blue shoes to match her wedding dress. She knew that stores in Regina closed at noon on Wednesdays back then, but she needed the shoes as the ceremony was scheduled for one o'clock that day.				"
16,A Family Stare Off Competition,Home-and-Family,"
					During the last several months, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I have spent some quality time together. I'm assuming this is quality time, but I will have to get second opinion evidence about that. Overall, we have been enjoying our time together without any interruptions, as usually is the case. My idea is to take advantage of the situation at hand, and taking advantage of this, we have been joyfully doing. In the beginning of our marital relationship, I thought I was the master at taking advantage situations. I was happy about that because that's what a husband is supposed to do. I was soon to find out that this was not necessarily the case. I don't know how long this has been going on, but I discovered something in our relationship that I didn't know. We had just settled down to watch a movie together, and at the commercial, I got up to go to the bathroom. As I was getting up, my wife said, ""While you're up, could you get me a cup of coffee?""

17,Carbon Monoxide Detectors for Travel,Home-and-Family,"
					If you plan a vacation or business trip, it is best to ensure your safety by packing a carbon monoxide (CO). These devices can lessen the uncertainties of any fire hazards or CO gas emission when relaxing or sleeping in a hotel room. It would be best if you always carried a portable CO detector to intercept gas leaks and a vacation turning fatal and chaotic. Evidence indicates that several countries do not meet CO detector installation requirements in hotels, especially in every room.				"
18,It Was A Week That Was Shot To Pieces,Home-and-Family,"
					I only made one mistake last week, which is something of a record for me. I try limiting mistakes to one at a time, but not always in sequential order. I once tried to make my mistakes in a logical order, but it turned out to be a mistake. The one faux pas I made was taking Monday off. I proposed to the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage that we take Monday off late Sunday evening, suggesting a contest to see who could sleep in the longest. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage readily agreed to my plan. This should have been a tip-off for me. On Monday, we decided to have a ""loafing contest"" to see who was the best loafer. Up to this point, I assumed superiority in this area. Many things fall into the category of not being able to do by Yours Truly but not this. Therefore, I concluded I had this contest in the bag.

19,Those Used To Be the Days,Home-and-Family,"
					Being limited as to travel and outside activities can sometimes get rather boring. You can be inactive only so long, and then you get in that car that drives you to crazy land. Finding something to do to keep me from being bored has become somewhat of a challenge. However, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage can always find something to do, especially something for me. That is why every day I ""act"" as if I am busy. I think I ought to get some Emmy award for that because I am a rather good actor. I have had a lot of practice. Not only that, but my hearing is not very good. Therefore, when my wife asked me something, I pretend that I am busy and cannot hear her. I think she has caught on to my acting skills here. There goes that Emmy.				"

4,There's Something About A Lazy Summer Afternoon,Home-and-Family,"
					The past week was an unusually quiet week around the parsonage. It enabled me to do something that I have wanted to do all summer long. Nothing. I am not bragging or anything, but I can do nothing right up there with the best of them. The week, as all weeks do, started on Monday. For me, there is always something about a Monday morning. And this Monday morning was going to set the tone for the rest of the week. It all began when the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage made one of her announcements. I live for these announcements because I know it will affect my whole week. ""Our daughter and I,"" she said rather matter-of-factly, ""will be going out of town for the entire day on Thursday."" This came as a shock to me, for I had not been forewarned. And you know what they say about being forewarned. However, I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.

8,Will There Be Television in Heaven?,Home-and-Family,"
					If anybody can ask hard questions, the award has to go to the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. She knows how to ask a question and, more importantly, when to ask a particular question. Throughout our marriage, she has become an expert in the area of questionology. There is not a question I can think of that she hasn't asked. On the other side of the parsonage, my expertise has been in not correctly answering questions. It is not that I cannot answer a question; I do not answer in a way that fits her expectations. That is important when it comes to my wife. Her expectation is quite high. Even though we have been married for such a long time, I have yet to master the art of hearing the question the way she wants it heard. My experience has taught me that if I do not answer the question correctly, I can be in deep trouble. Believe me, I have experience in this.				"

Following are some of the concerns that I am hearing:     Many children do not have established routines and are sleeping in so miss their internet sessions with their teachers.				"
10,My Thoughts Are Worth More Than a Penny,Home-and-Family,"
					I must admit that I do gravel a lot in thinking about my thoughts. It has been a habit of mine down through the years. Thinking is what really makes life worth living, or so I believe. My father had a saying whenever he saw me staring off into the distance, ""A penny for your thoughts, son."" Then he would smile, and I knew he really was not interested in what I was thinking he was just trying to set some kind of trap for me. Fortunately, I never fell into that trap, whatever it was. Of course, at the time I could've used an extra penny. One of my favorite writers, when I was young, was a man by the name of James Thurber. He was blind, but he was one of the great writers of his day. He would think his thoughts about the story he was working on all day long, then sit down with his secretary, tell her the story from memory, and write it down.				"

12,And Then It Was Silent No More,Home-and-Family,"
					During this time of exclusive lockdown, I and the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage have grown accustomed to silence. Don't get me wrong here. I do not object to noise as long as it's the right kind of noise. However, I do have a good warm feeling about silence. What was that song? ""The Sounds of Silence."" Silence is wonderful and soothing, enabling me to sit back and enjoy a good read. There is nothing like reading a book, and from my point of view, I have not read a book unless I have read it ten times. If it is a good book, the more I read it, the better it is. My wife, on the other hand, when she has read a book that is the end of it. Even with some TV shows, when she has seen it once, that is all she needs. Me, if I like a TV show, I love watching it repeatedly. I do not know if it's me or not, but I seem to find something I did not see before every time I reread a book. That's what makes reading a book over and over exciting for me.				"

Being shut down at home for quite a while it is not that exciting. You can only be shut down for so long. On Tuesday, I needed to go across town for some quick business and office supplies. It would not take me long, and I would get back home in a short time. ""Anything you want me to pick up while I'm out?"" I queried the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. I always like to try to help whenever I can. She is a great shopper, particularly a great thrift store shopper. She knows every thrift shop within a 100-mile radius, but more than that, they know her by her first name. I, on the other side of the room, am not a very good shopper.				"

Not too long ago, my wife came up with something to make our time a little more memorable. She called it, casual pajama time. After breakfast, we would wear our morning casual pajamas. After lunch, it would be our afternoon casual pajamas. And, after supper, it would be our evening casual pajamas. I never heard of this before, but I joined in with the fun.

					For the last five days, I have not been able to sleep nor close my eyes at night. It's been a nightmare. During the last four weeks, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and Yours Truly have been sequestered in our home and loving it. I cannot remember a time in our marriage that we have spent so much time together with no serious obligations needing attention. It is marvelous to spend 24/7 together. If this is what senior retirement is like, I'm giving it some earnest consideration. Nobody ever told me this could be so wonderful. Spending time together is great; my wife spends time in her craft room, doing what she does in that craft room. For obvious reasons, I am not allowed in that room, which is okay with me. She has been making all sorts of things and loving it. I think she made a bunch of masks and then some signs that said, Faith/Fear to give to some friends.				"

I know I am used to being confused, but I have exceeded my limit on this time aspect. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I have been spending all of our time together. We do not go anywhere except sometimes I slip over to the office and come back. Besides that, we are in each other's company, 24/7. Or is it 7/24? I'm not sure anymore. For the most part, it has been a wonderful vacation from the rest of the world. I assure you, we surely needed this vacation. Sometimes the world can get rather sticky, if you know what I mean? After being married for so many years (I cannot really remember how many it has been) I have begun to understand a little more about the other resident in our parsonage.				"

We have enjoyed spending quality time together and catching up on things that happened 50 years ago. Her memory is a lot better than mine, to be sure. This time off has really been a rejuvenating experience, at least for me. I must confess that I have had a Pajama Dilemma I never experienced before. When do I take my pajamas off in the morning, get dressed, and then later, when do I undress and put on my pajamas?

					For the last several weeks, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and myself have been enjoying some quiet time in our parsonage. I cannot remember the last time we had such quiet time all to ourselves. One of the blessings of this time is the fact that telemarketers are not calling. In a way, I miss them because I used to harass them as much as they were harassing me. But we will come back to that in a few weeks or months. I did not know what a wonderful time it was until yesterday as my wife and I were enjoying our supper together. Usually, throughout the week, we spend quite a bit of time at a restaurant because of our schedule. It is not often that we can spend a whole week having our meals together. Enjoying home-cooked meals is one of the great pleasures of being married to someone who knows how to cook. If the cooking were left up to me, it would be a completely different story. The truth is, it is not up to me and I say a grateful, hallelujah!				"

					During the past week, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and Yours Truly have been spending quite a bit of time together. I cannot recall any time that we have spent this much time together. The exception would be when we first got married. Even then, both of us worked during the day and were going to a Bible Institute at night. Occasionally our schedule collided, but rarely. Because we both had energy, we did not realize how much we were doing. Every day had its own blessing. It was not long before the babies came knocking on our door, and we graciously invited them in. From then on, time alone was a thing of the past. It is amazing to me how much time a baby can take from you. But it was time well invested, I assure you. As a 21-year-old father, I thought I had lots of energy. It was not until the babies started coming that I realized my energy was long ago spent. Why does God give babies so much energy? I think He does it on purpose.				"

3,"Have Nose, Will Sneeze",Home-and-Family,"
					Many things about me could be called into question, and a lot has. I get that. However, the most attractive thing about me is my nose. I am not sure of the reason why, it looks like anybody else's nose. My nose, however, attracts everything around it, from dust to pollen and other unmentionables. If there is something not attracted to my nose I haven't found it yet. This past week has been no exception. If it was in the air, it was in my nose. I do not know why my nose is so attractive to things, but there it is. I am the one that suffers the consequences of that attractive nose of mine. To be very certain, I did not pick my nose, it came with my face. It seems the older I get, the more attractive my nose gets. I do not know if that is old age or if I am just beginning to notice it. When I was younger, of course, I was busy with other things, although I cannot remember what they were. Now that I am older, I have more time to pay attention to stupid things like my nose.				"

					It was a busy week last week. I was chasing my tail so much, I thought I would actually catch it. What I would do after I caught it is beyond my imagination. However, I was quite busy, and then the mail came. Whenever the mail comes, I'm always expecting ""the check."" Rarely do I get it, but my expectation is that I will get a $10,000 check. I don't know from whom. ""What are you going to the mailbox for?"" The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage would ask. ""Are you looking for your $10,000 check?"" One of these days, I am going to get a $10,000 check and rub it in her face before I take it to the bank. This time the mail brought me a package from one of my relatives. It turned out to be old pictures of my family from decades ago. Most of them were black-and-white, so you can imagine how old they were.				"

She gave me a great compliment the other day when she said, ""Dear, you're as smart as you will ever be."" I am still not over that, and I walk around with my chest pushed out a little bit, not in front of her, though. Honesty will make me say that I do not know as much as I really ought to know. So much I do not know that I am not quite sure how much that is. I really won't ever come to that conclusion. I would say, and do not repeat this to my wife, but I am smarter today than I ever was in my life. To put it bluntly, I am smarter today than the day she married me. That is as far as I am going to go on that topic.				"

					I am old enough to remember those days when there was nothing like cell phones. Oh, those quiet, golden silent days. At the time, I did not realize just how wonderful that time was. Every time you needed to make a phone call, you had to go to where a phone was. Those were the days of the telephone booth. Remember those? That's where Clark Kent turned into Superman. We don't have Superman today because there are no telephone booths. I well remember the day I bought my first cell phone. I hesitated because I enjoyed my quiet time. However, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage was enthusiastic about getting cell phones. That way, she could call me whenever she wanted. I thought that was rather nice, and we went out and bought our first pair of cell phones. But it took me a little bit of time to learn how to operate this new technology. Unfortunately, at the time, I had no grandchildren who could walk me through this process.				"

But when you complain out loud, then you run the chance of somebody hearing you. The somebody I was most concerned about was the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. Some things are meant to be kept to yourself and for obvious reasons. For some reason, who knows what it was, I let my guard down and vocalized my complaining. I must confess that it rather caught me off guard. ""What are you complaining about,"" my wife said, directing the question to me. At first, I did not know what she was talking about because I did not realize that I was vocalizing my complaints. All I could say at the time was, ""Did I say that out loud?"" My wife has a delicate way of backing me in a corner where I have to say what is on my mind. Fortunately, I do not have much of a mind for anything to get on. Unfortunately, my tongue is not attached to anything, and so it is loosey-goosey.				"

16,What Did We Know Before Facebook?,Home-and-Family,"
					To paraphrase one of my favorite humorist, Will Rogers, ""All I know is what I read on Facebook."" I must admit that I also get information from Facebook. I can keep up with my family and friends, know what they are doing, and know what they are saying. The information there, whether true or not, is available to all who read. Quite honestly, I don't always believe what I read on Facebook. Just saying! As you grow and get older, you adjust to the changing environment that you are in along with the technology. I well remember the day I transitioned from a manual typewriter to a computer. My first computer had no hard drive, and many, perhaps cannot relate to that. However, I thought I was in writer's heaven. I never thought much about this until one day a young person asked me, ""How did you know anything before Facebook?"" There was a young man born after the invention of Facebook. At first, I did not quite understand what he was saying. I had grown accustomed to the developing modern-day technology. Not that I am an expert, I am just a user.				"
17,To One It's Monday to Another It's Wednesday,Home-and-Family,"
					Time goes so fast at times that I do not always remember what day it is. I get so busy trying to get my work done that I forget if it's Monday or Friday. It is a good thing I am getting older because I have a built-in excuse for forgetting what day it is. Recently, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I spent some time in St. Augustine for some vacation days. We don't often get to have vacation days, but when we do, we try to enjoy it. Just down a few blocks from our motel is a place we love dinning. It's called the Village Inn. What I like about this restaurant is that on Wednesdays they always have free pie with anything you order even if it's just coffee. Free is always a good thing with me. I know that nothing is free, but sometimes it is. Anybody who knows me knows that I do not take many things seriously. I enjoyed being around people who are very seriously minded because I can get away with a lot of jokes with them. Some things are to be serious, but those are rather few.				"

It takes an awful lot of work for her and, I let her work as hard as she wants to work. That's the kinda husband I am. She scheduled us to stay for several days in St. Augustine. We always enjoy our stay there and look forward to going there. The people who own the motel where we stay are good friends of ours. It is great to get together with friends that you only see once a year. Being exhausted from a whole year's work, my wife and I looked forward to this time of doing nothing. I did not realize how much work was involved in doing nothing.				"

0,The Difference Between a Fool and Being Full,Home-and-Family,"
					One thing truly amazes is how fast Thanksgiving goes. Here I am in the living room relaxing in my easy chair just one day after Thanksgiving. My ears are still ringing with all the chatter that went on around our Thanksgiving dinner table. It is so beautiful to get together with family to celebrate. As I was sitting in my chair, I noticed I was feeling rather stuffed. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage is an expert at stuffing turkeys. I am the turkey she stuffs the best. She never takes credit for it because all through the dinner, she asks me, ""Don't you think you've had enough?"" She has yet to understand that, especially at a Thanksgiving table, I don't ""think."" I am not there to think but to stuff myself with all of the deliciousness on the table. The week before Thanksgiving, I had a doctor's appointment. I discussed an issue with my nurse, which was, ""Is a pumpkin a vegetable?""				"

2,A Post Thanksgiving Wishbone,Home-and-Family,"
					Now that Thanksgiving is over, I can sit back and recoup from the activity. I'm not sure about anybody else, but a holiday such as Thanksgiving takes a lot out of me. Of course, it puts a lot in me, but that's another story. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and Yours Truly were catching our breath right after our Thanksgiving fiesta. I was enjoying the quiet moment when my wife said to me, ""Do you know what time it is?"" I glanced at my wrist watch and said, ""It's 8:30 right on the dot."" My wife threw one of those looks at me, I was tempted not to catch and said, ""That's not what I mean, and you know it."" This is the problem I have. My wife assumes I know exactly what she's talking about every time she speaks. To be quite honest, it is a rare day when Yours Truly knows exactly what the wife is talking about whenever she speaks. This might be the reason I get into a little bit of trouble with her every now and then.				"

4,Is An Apple Fritter a Donut?,Home-and-Family,"
					I cannot express how ecstatic I was when someone gave me a coupon for a free donut. Normally, I am not overly excited about ""free."" All I had to do was fill out a little survey online and they would send me a code that would guarantee me a free donut. In my ""daily diary diet,"" I have a whole section devoted to the subject that when a forbidden food is free it cancels out all calories. When I first told the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage, she looked at me rather strangely and said, ""Who said that?"" I know we are both getting old but we are not that old! I got close to her, waved my hand so she could see me and said, ""It's me. I just said it. Can you hear me now?"" ""That is not funny. You know exactly what I meant."" My grin drained from my face and I said to her, ""Well, I said it."" ""Did,"" she said inquisitively, ""anybody ever say that before you said it?""				"
5,Getting Old Is Not for Sissies,Home-and-Family,"
					I will not admit to being old, but I am older than I was 10 years ago. Those 10 years have been filled with all kinds of things helping me to get older. I saw an article that said that 60 is the new 40. I have no idea what that means, but I think out in our culture there is an obsession about age. People cannot accept getting older. This year was the 50th anniversary of my high school graduation. Unfortunately, I did not get to go, but I did see many of the pictures from that celebration. Looking at those pictures, I did not know how old my high school friends really were. It probably was a good thing that I did not go for a variety of reasons. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were sitting around enjoying an evening cup of coffee. Nothing like a good hot cup of coffee to settle the nerves. It's not that I have nerves, but it's just an excuse to drink coffee.				"

7,Thinking Has a Way of Getting Me Into Trouble,Home-and-Family,"
					Just when I think I have all my bases covered, a new one shows up, and it's not a homerun. I know all my tocks don't tick, but I do the best I can. I may not be the best all the time, but I try, and I try, and I try. I do not want to be a nuisance to anybody, so I try not to, especially with the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. (Does trying count for anything?) Quite often, I make the mistake of believing because I have been married so long I know my wife and what she is going to do or say next. Confidence is a tricky thing, however. The more confidence I think I have, the more trouble I seem to get into. I certainly do not want to be negative in this regard, but I have the proof that it works in my life. On her birthday, I try to give her something that will make her happy. If you do not think that is a hard chore, then come over to my house and try it one time. Just when I think she is into a certain thing, I blow it.				"
8,It Was One of Those Weeks,Home-and-Family,"
					At my stage in life, I have experienced a gazillion weeks. I thought about actually counting how many weeks I have lived, but I don't have that many fingers or toes. It doesn't matter how many weeks it is. I have lived enough weeks to know, when you think you have experienced everything there is to experience, then another week shows itself. No matter how bad a week can be another week can always be worse. On the other side, no matter how good a week can be, another week can be better. I do have one complaint this week. Who was that knucklehead that invented the telephone? I would like to call him and give him a piece of my mind if I have any pieces left. (Does anybody write letters anymore?) Imagine how quiet my life would be if nobody could call me?				"

10,I Didn't Know How Young I Really Was,Home-and-Family,"
					I have heard it said that confession is good for the soul. I want to take that a step further and say confession is good for the body as well. I don't often think about how old I am, I'm too busy with other thoughts. Occasionally, something happens that reminds me I am not quite as old as I think I am. Do not get me wrong, it is a good experience for soul and body. When I get up in the morning, I feel achy, not to mention grouchy because the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage mentions that. I get up feeling old and dreary. I wallow in despair, thinking how old I really am and not knowing what to do with it. Oh, poor me, woe is me. Something happened this past week that gave me a completely different view of how old I really am.				"
11,A Minister And A Day Off His Rocker,Home-and-Family,"
					I was tootling along one day last week, quite focused on getting my business for the day done. In fact, I was feeling good about the progress I was making with my ""to-do list."" Nothing is more satisfying to me than the sense of being in control of my schedule. I love checking off items on my ""to-do list."" As the scheme of things usually develops with me, this euphoric situation was not long-lived. It was left to the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage to bring a sense of reality into my life. ""Haven't you forgotten something?"" She asked me. This question drove me back to my daily planner. Frantically, I searched my schedule to see what appointment I had missed or what project I had overlooked this time. With all due respect to her, I could not find anywhere in my schedule, or on my calendar, where I had missed anything.				"
12,Buried in Treasures - Help for People With Hoarding Issues,Home-and-Family,"
					People with hoarding issues are often isolated and misunderstood. They think that they are the only people out there who have too much clutter. But it's more widespread than most people know. You can't tell a hoarder by looking at them. It has nothing to do with how much money you have or your level of education. Hoarding is a dark secret for most people. But now there is hope.				"
13,"To Grin or Not to Grin, Is My Dilemma",Home-and-Family,"
					Through the years, I have experienced one dilemma after another. I remember my father once told me, ""Son, when life delivers you a dilemma, make lemonade out of it."" To which I looked at him with a big grin and said, ""Is there any dilemma I can make a root beer out of it?"" My father did not grin back. This may have been the beginning of my career as a grinner. Rarely a day goes by that I do not find something to grin about. I have earned a Ph.D. in Grinology. One problem I have discovered in this is that I do not know when not to grin. This has caused me a dilemma without any lemonade whatsoever or root beer. On my wedding day, I grinned all day long and nobody ever had to ask me the question, ""What are you grinning about?"" Everybody knew. I never had any problem with grinning and nobody ever challenged me about my grinning. I guess it is just my nature to grin about everything.				"
14,I Wasn't Born Old It Just Happened That Way,Home-and-Family,"
					Everywhere I look these days people are obsessed with age. More products are sold today to make you look younger than anything else. Everybody desires to look younger than what they actually are. I think that is rather hypocritical. Just saying. It seems to me that nobody is happy with the way they are. When you are young, you want to be old and then when you get old you want to be young. Nobody is happy being what they are at the time. The problem with me is that not all my clocks are ticking at the same time. Things seem to just creep up on me without me being aware of any of it. For one, I did not know I was old. It dawned on me this past week when I was sitting in my chair in the middle of the afternoon. I had no inspiration to get out of the chair and go do something. I was just feeling a little tired. You know, sometimes it is important just to chill out for a little bit.				"
15,It Was a Belly-Binge Kind of Day,Home-and-Family,"
					It's not often that a day goes my way. Occasionally, I have a day that focuses on my desires and me. It was a Monday evening right after supper and the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were watching TV. ""Oh,"" my wife said, ""by the way, the girls and I are going to go thrift store shopping all day tomorrow."" At first, I was a little stunned. I wasn't quite sure why she was telling me this. It's not like she needs my permission to go thrift store shopping as long as she doesn't take my truck. But, being the veteran husband I am, I did not ask any questions. I have found that after a long marriage as I have had, that when you ask a question you will get an answer. Most of the time, the answer is not what you really want to hear. So, I keep my questions to the very minimum to say the least. And usually, I do say the least.				"
16,Stuck Between a Virus and a Varmint,Home-and-Family,"
					Normally, I'm not a superstitious sort of a person. But then again there is a good case to be made that I am really not normal. If you stop to think about it, (and I have), the average person is a composite of everybody and the description ends up to be that of nobody. That is exactly what I think about being normal. I must confess, I do have a sliver of superstition running through me somewhere. Often I have the feeling that someone is looking over my shoulder and smiling rather sarcastically. I cannot prove it, of course, but I know it is there. Several things happened this past week emphasizing this feeling of mine, and I am not at all convinced that it is simply coincidental. After all, is anything coincidental? It all started when the computer at the church was viciously attacked by a computer virus. Who do you call when your computer has a virus? And, what in the world is a virus doing inside my computer? Doesn't it have something better to do?				"
17,It's Hard for Me to Conceal a Giggle,Home-and-Family,"
					Throughout life, I have discovered many challenges. Some I have handled fairly well and others have handled me pretty badly. That is what makes life so interesting. Every day there is a challenge to face and every day there is a victory to win. Recently, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I celebrated our 48th wedding anniversary. I would not be truthful if I did not admit that those 48 years have been rather challenging. Not so much in a negative way, but each challenge carried with it a life lesson. At the end of these 48 years, I must confess my wife knows more about me then I know about myself, or her for that matter. How she has come to these conclusions, I do not know. But, to be honest I do not know very much about myself compared to what she knows.				"
18,Our Heritage,Home-and-Family,"

19,I Sure Do Miss St. Sanity,Home-and-Family,"
					The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and me recently celebrated our 48th wedding anniversary. It sure does not seem we have been married that long. I guess, as you get older, according to my grandmother, time goes faster. If that is true, I must be getting older. We met in September, became engaged in February of the following year and in August of that year we had our ""I Do"" ceremony. As a na√Øve young man, I did not know that that ""I Do"" meant that for the rest of my life I would ""Do."" I must say I have tried to keep up to that sacred covenant for all these years. Confession is in order here, and I must say that on the wife's side of this relationship, the ""I Do"" covenant has been faithfully upheld.				"

0,"My Mirror Doesn't Lie, But Sometimes It Giggles",Home-and-Family,"
					I have never been fascinated by my looks, and I don't think anybody else has either. Sometimes, however, I have to spend a little more time before the mirror to get prepared for where I am going. I must say, I am not fond of mirrors and I make it as quick as possible. I do not trust mirrors. When I was a youngster, my family lived very close to Hershey Park in Pennsylvania. One of the major attractions there was the ""House of Mirrors."" You would walk in and the mirrors would distort what you really looked like. Walking through, we would always laugh and point to the person in the mirror not acknowledging that it was us. I could not trust those mirrors at Hershey Park, which has stayed with me all my life. I had forgotten about those mirrors until recently. I was getting ready to go somewhere and the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said, ""Have you looked in the mirror today?"" Not knowing what she was talking about I muttered, ""Yes, I glanced at it this morning.""				"
1,"And Then, There It Was",Home-and-Family,"
					It is not that I do not like to travel; I just don't like to leave home. I am quite comfortable at home where I have everything I need within easy reach. Sometimes I have to travel to a conference or something, which is rather inconvenient for me. However, as my friend used to say, ""That's life."" According to my calculations, I would have to travel 13 hours to get to my destination. I pondered for a long time whether it was worth it or not. Then the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said, ""Go ahead. You need a break."" What she meant by ""a break,"" was far from my comprehension at the time. I guess she needed a break from me, which is my personal opinion. However, taking her advice I packed my bags and prepared for my trip on the road. Early the next morning I loaded my vehicle and set out on my trip. I must say that driving by yourself and being alone does have its advantages. After the first hour or so, I lost track of what those advantages really were. Talking to myself is the most boring conversation I could ever have.				"

					I was having a rather down day recently. You know how it is; you are going along 100 miles an hour and finally you crash. I was experiencing one of those reality crashes. Reclining in my chair, drinking coffee, I thought of one of my old friends. Oh my, he has been gone for almost 5 years now. How time flies by so quickly! You know you have friends and then you have those who are really friends. He was without a doubt one of the latter. In fact, I do not have any friend that quite equals him as a friend. Thinking about him, I began chuckling. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage came in about that time and said, ""What are you laughing at?"" She knew I was going through a rather busy schedule and to find me sitting in a chair chuckling was a little strange. ""I was just thinking,"" I said while still chuckling, ""of my good friend Brother Lloyd.""				"

					I do not consider myself lazy. I think of myself as an Energy Conservative. I am saving my energy for sometime down the road when I may need it, and who knows when. This, however, is not the opinion of the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. If there is a lazy bone in her, it has sprouted wings and flown away a long time ago. She works hard, which I do not mind, except she expects me to keep up with her. I enjoy slouching around, busily engaged in doing nothing. I have become an expert in this, which has become more than a hobby with me. Occasionally my wife will say, ""What are you doing right now?"" To which I answer, ""Nothing."" Her response is, ""I thought so. Could you come and help me now?""				"

12,And Then the Thunder Roared,Home-and-Family,"
					In our house, thunder has a variety of meanings. Some not as good as others, but that is another story. Either way, I am not a fan of thunder. Recently, some heavy thunder visited our area along with rain and lightning. I was beginning to understand how Noah felt during his first night in that Ark. Some of the thunder was so loud it seemed like it was inside our house. Thankfully, I lost my heebie-jeebies a long time ago. All week long the rain came and with the rain was lightning and of course, thunder. What in the world would a rainstorm be without thunder? One night the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I decided to stay inside and enjoy listening to the thunder on the outside. Nothing is more cozy than listening to it rain and thunder while drinking a nice hot cup of coffee. It is even better when an Apple fritter comes with that coffee, but that would create a different kind of thunder on the inside.				"

15,My Favorite Day of the Week Is Tomorrow,Home-and-Family,"
					It was one of those weeks when the more I completed, the more I had to do. These are not my favorite kind of weeks. So frustrating. During these weeks, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage finagles her infamous ""Honey-Do-List"" in my direction. Because I am busy doing other things and distracted, I do not actually see what she is doing. She can slip one of her ""To-Do"" jobs on to my schedule without my knowing it. I see it on my schedule and assume it is one more job to do. When I see it, I say to myself, ""I'll do that tomorrow."" Then I can move on to my next project. My favorite saying has been, ""Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow?"" It has become a habit with me. The wife will ask me if I have time to do something and I always say, ""Not now, but I can do it tomorrow."" Of course, I am hoping that by the time tomorrow comes she will have forgotten that little job.				"
16,Let The Summer Fun Begin,Home-and-Family,"
					Now that summer is upon us, we can turn our back on those frosty days of winter. I like winter as long as it is in the past tense. Otherwise, all that cold tenses me up something terrific. Now that summer is upon me, I can sit back, relax and enjoy those crazy, lazy days of summer. My plans for the summer have already been established. I have a little notebook with all the things I plan to do during the summer. If someone were to open that little notebook, they will find, much to their surprise, not a thing written on any page. That is precisely my plan. I plan to do nothing during the summer. This is a relatively new strategy on my part. Every time I plan to do something, it never turns out right. In fact, if I plan to go right everything turns around and I end up going left. Therefore, my ingenious plan is to plan the opposite of what I really want to do. After all, it cannot be any worse than what I have been doing up to now.				"

					When I was a child, we were taught about patriotism.

19,Whatever Happened to the Simple Things in Life?,Home-and-Family,"
					I'm not a very complicated person. I like simple things; things nice and easy. Occasionally I will do a crossword puzzle, but beside that, I enjoy the simple life. On the other side, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage is very complicated. Just when I have everything figured out, I find another side of her that I did not know was there. I suppose that is what married life is all about; year-by-year discovering new aspects of your spouse. I am very simple minded when it comes to going out to eat. When we go to a restaurant, for example, I'm very simple in what I order. Most of the time I order the same thing because I enjoy what I am eating at the time. My wife is not quite like that. Ordering her supper is quite a complicated thing. It takes several minutes to go through the menu and then several minutes to think about what she wants to eat. Me, I tell the waitress, ""I'll have a cheeseburger, French fries and a Diet Coke."" And that's that.				"

					The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were dining out at a very nice restaurant. We had been on the road for two days and were weary of travel. At least, I was. Nothing I hate more on a vacation than travel. But this time it was not so bad because my wife was doing all the driving. She's an excellent driver because she had the world's best teacher. I admit that I was her teacher. We were seated and began looking at the menu. Then my wife said, ""You don't take very many things seriously, do you?"" We both laughed, but I knew she was right. Life is too short to be serious about everything. I do not want to come to the last of my days and find I have 100 giggles left over. I want to giggle all the way to the end. The waitress came, graciously took our order and then brought back the bread for us to begin our lunch.				"
1,Another Vacation in the Bank,Home-and-Family,"
					The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I arrived home from our vacation late Tuesday afternoon. I'm not one for vacations, but this one was special. Our grandson who lives in Ohio was graduating from high school and then this summer he would be heading off to London for some soccer group. He loves soccer. This is the second of our grandchildren to graduate from high school. I would not say this to everybody but, this year is the 50th anniversary of my graduation from high school. I cannot believe it has been that long. I must have fallen asleep for several years without waking up. To see a grandson graduate from high school and then look at my graduation picture 50 years ago I was amazed. How can he be as old as I was? What he does not understand is that one day he will be as old as I am. I will not be the one to tell him that. We spent the whole week with the family there that we have not seen for several years. It was such a wonderful time.				"

3,"What Is a Day Off, Really?",Home-and-Family,"
					I'm not one who gets excited about holidays. If up to me there would be one holiday per month, and that's it. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage loves holidays, no matter what it is. For her it is a time to have a ""Day Off."" If anybody knows how to celebrate a day off it is her. By January, she has all the holidays noted on her calendar and what she is going to do on those holidays. I do not even want to celebrate my birthday. With all my birthdays, you would think I would get tired of celebrating them. And, I have. The birthday just reminds you are getting older. I do not need that kind of reminder; the pain in my body does that for me. The problem with my birthday is it is two days before my wife's birthday. I am not quite sure how I planned that, but if I had to do it over again, I am not sure our birthdays would be that close.				"
4,Eating Out Of My Comfort Zone,Home-and-Family,"
					One pleasure the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and myself enjoy is going out for a quiet dinner together. It does not happen often, at least not often enough. When it does, it is always a delightful time and we try to take advantage of it. The delight on my wife's side is that she does not have to cook the meal and then clean up afterwards. I have offered to help clean up, but only once and I am now forbidden to get anywhere near the dishwasher. And, for good reason. Once in the early days of our marriage, I decided to surprise her by cooking supper for her. She spent the afternoon shopping with some friends and so I thought it was the proper time for me to do this. Up until that time, I did not know how difficult cooking was. I've seen my grandmother do it and my mother and now my wife, so I thought it was a rather easy thing to do. I must confess I have never studied these ladies while they were preparing the meal. I enjoyed the meal when it was done and that satisfied me.				"

7,Understanding the Grandpa Rules,Home-and-Family,"
					As circumstance would have it, and I like to give circumstances due credit, I was visiting my grandchildren without the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. Normally, if there is such a status, my wife travels with me when we visit the grandchildren. However, when she is along I do not have a chance. I will not say that she hogs the grandchildren, she does, I just will not say so. As a husband, I know when to speak my mind and when to mind my speaking. The inexperienced husband does not know the difference and pays for it. With the opportunity before me to go solo with the grandchildren, I determined to make the best of it. I never know when this kind of a situation will repeat itself. When my wife is with me, she always holds the reins, but now I have nobody to curtail my visit with the grandchildren. I am a freelance grandpa.				"

					Like many people, I try planning and arranging my week so I can accomplish as much as possible. For example, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage on Monday morning hands me her ""honey-do-list"" to complete by the end of the week. When she hands it to me, I smile and underneath that list I have concealed from her my ""to-do-list."" It is not that I ignore her list... well, maybe I do. But, I don't do it on purpose... well, maybe I do. I have a priority with my ""to-do-list"" and most times forget about hers.				"

11,"Finding ""Good"" In Our World Is Challenging",Home-and-Family,"
					In our world today, it is difficult to find anything good, let alone anything good to say about anything or anyone. One thing I like about the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage is that she can find some good in just about everything. Sometimes it just rubs me the wrong way. I, on the other hand, have a hard time finding good in anything even though I try so hard. That just demonstrates the difference between us. They say opposites attract, and so we have a very strong attraction here. For the most part, I go along with her evaluation of ""Good"" because she has been right more times than wrong. Don't ask me when she has been wrong, for that would be a very delicate subject and I am not a very delicate person. One area of life I have a very difficult time finding anything good is politics. I stay completely away from politics as much as possible. Oh yes, there have been those times that I greedily rubbed my hands and wanted to jump into that cesspool. Thankfully, I do have a little bit of common sense still lurking around in my head and refrain.				"
12,Lazy Does Have Its Advantages,Home-and-Family,"
					As a young boy, my father tried drilling into my brain that laziness was not acceptable in his house. If I wanted to be lazy, I had to go outside. He provided a wonderful role model for me because if my father was anything, he was not lazy. He tried to encourage me not to be lazy. Laziness, according to him, was an attack on common decency and energy. After all these years, I have tried to live up to his standard. And yet, I must confess that I have found that laziness may have an advantage or two. I'm leaning towards the two. It was my fortune to marry a young lady who did not have an inkling of laziness in any of her bones. I thought when I first married her; she was trying to impress me with how active she was and how much she could get done. I have discovered, however, that that certainly was not the case. Laziness and she have never met as far as I understand it.				"

19,A Cookie Isn't a Cookie Unless You Can Sneak It,Home-and-Family,"
					The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I enjoy one glorious connection; she loves to bake and I love to eat what she bakes. I did not marry her because of her baking skills because I did not know she had them at the time. I did know her mother was a wonderful cook and I assumed there might be some gene transferred to her daughter. If the truth were known, she loves to bake as much as I love to eat. Whenever there is a function in the church, she is always baking, especially cookies. Her cookies are the best I have ever eaten, and believe me, I have eaten a lot. So many that I have gotten into trouble several times. My only response to her inquiries along this line is, ""If you didn't make such delicious cookies I would not be tempted to eat them. So, it's all your fault."" I have yet to sell that line to her, but I still try. Of course, if I could sell her this I could sell her anything. So much for trying.				"

1,"What It Was, Was a Hummingbird",Home-and-Family,"
					Even as old as I am, there are still things I fear. I do not want to make a list, I'm afraid to. When I have conquered one fear, another one knocks on the door and introduces itself to me. Out of respect, I fear that fear. This is not true of the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. As far as I know, she fears nothing, but many things and people fear her. I am the president of that Fear Group. She has a subtle way of expressing her fear and each day I am learning more of that subtlety. I am not sure why, but most of her fear has to do with what I am eating at the time. She has some phobia about apple fritters, especially me eating them. One thing about her is that she always faces her fear head on. That was, until recently. Last Tuesday I came home from my office and entering the house I heard some screaming, ""Get away from me. Don't you dare come near me. Leave right away."" I was scared at first. I was thinking these remarks were directed in my direction.				"

3,I'm Really Enjoying My Naivety,Home-and-Family,"
					Someone recently said to me, ""You sure are na√Øve."" I'm not sure what the incident was about at the time, and I was a little bit hurt by that saying. What did he mean that I am na√Øve? I have been giving this some thought and at this point, I remember quite a few people labeling me as na√Øve. Therefore, if people are right, it must be true. Yet, is it really that bad? Leaving the house the other day the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said, ""Drive carefully."" I stopped, turned around, put my hands on my hips and said, ""Wow, you just destroyed my driving. I was not planning on driving carefully."" She laughed. The secret of naivety is taking things literally. When people take things literally they usually take it out of context and it does not sound that good. When the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage says, ""Drive carefully,"" all she is saying is ""Goodbye, hope to see you later."" That is all.				"
4,"I Don't Miss My Teacher's Hickory Stick, But She Never Did",Home-and-Family,"
					I am not sure why I think of some things, however, occasionally I remember something that happened a million years ago. Or so it seems. This week for some reason, I happened to think of my fifth grade elementary school teacher. Her name was Miss Ammon. She was a wonderful teacher in many regards and taught me quite a bit or at least she tried. As a fifth-grader, I looked at her as a very old woman. She might've been 50, I'm not sure. One of my friends joked and asked her, ""Miss Ammon, how was Noah as a student?"" I am glad he asked and not me because the class was then introduced to her ""Hickory Stick."" I say we, but it was my friend with the stupid question that was actually introduced to it. After the incident, she told the class, ""I have here in my hand the Board of Education which shall be applied to the seat of your learning when necessary."" Nobody even snickered, but left that alone.				"
5,A Smile Is Both Contagious and Healthy,Home-and-Family,"
					My grandfather had a favorite saying that went something like this, ""A frown is just a smile upside down."" Nobody could smile quite like my grandfather. He never waited for any reason to smile, he just smiled. In fact, thinking about it today, I do not ever remember seeing my grandfather frown. I am sure he did, because we all do. However, it was not a major part of his life. Whenever the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage sends me to the grocery store, I usually notice most people have an upside down smile. Some of them look like they have worked very hard to get it. Me, I walk around smiling. Occasionally I will have to do something to make somebody smile. It gets under my skin when I see somebody not smiling and I start itching. I know I have to do something to change that situation. I notice when walking around smiling and looking at people right in their eyes, I usually get a smile in return. Then I will smile at the people smiling back at me who do not have any understanding of why they are smiling.				"
6,The Question of the Disappearing Ice Cream,Home-and-Family,"
					A mystery has developed within the halls of our once peaceful domicile. At first, I did not think too seriously about it. Some things, if left alone usually take care of themselves. Of course, there always are other things, like my socks, that never take care of themselves no matter how hard I wish. A hint of the mystery came my way on Wednesday when the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage went to the freezer for a box of ice cream. According to her, this was supposed to be for our dessert after supper. But, if I have all the facts correct, she went to the freezer and did not find the anticipated box of ice cream. I was preoccupied with the evening news on television when my wife came and stood in the archway with both hands on her hips, staring at me with one of those looks and said, ""Where did the ice cream go?""				"
7,"O Holiday, Who Art Thou Today?",Home-and-Family,"
					Generally speaking, and who speaks generally anymore these days, I am not much of a holiday fan. There seems to be a holiday every day of the week. So many holidays that I cannot keep up and quite frankly, I do not have much incentive to keep up. When I was young, I enjoyed holidays but now that I am a husband, a father, a grandfather, every holiday is billed to my account, to such an extent I cannot get out of it. I hold my wallet very tight, but evidently not tight enough. Somebody invented holidays just to sell greeting cards and make a ton of money. So, I am not a great advocate of holidays. I fondly remember as a youngster getting up Christmas morning excited about what Santa had brought me under the Christmas tree. Little did I know that my father was taking care of all the cost. How was I to know that Christmas had a price tag to it? Nobody ever told me when I was young the Christmas presents cost anything.				"
8,"It's a Soap Opera World, Or Is It",Home-and-Family,"
					As a child, I remember my mother watching soap operas in the afternoon. I never had much interest in them; I would rather watch The Lone Ranger and his companion Tonto. One afternoon I was sitting in the living room while she was watching one of her soap operas. I was trying to figure out what in the world was happening. None of it made sense and it seemed to be more drama than anything else. Why they call it, ""soap opera"" I will never know because they could use more soap in their conversations. My mother would talk to the characters on TV telling them what they should be doing and saying. Several times, she yelled at them giving them instructions. I caught her with tears in her eyes over a certain situation; I could not tell you now what that situation was. Although I never was much interested in soap operas, as I have gotten older (and I intend to get a lot older) I begin to see similarities. I am not an expert on soap operas by a long shot. However, it seems to me that our world has become a gigantic soap opera.				"
9,Are We Addicted to Plastic?,Home-and-Family,"
					Plastic is all around us. Just look around anywhere that you are sitting right now. There're probably plastic pens, folders, notebooks, and much more in your office. You are also probably surrounded by other plastic items too. Many parts of our car are made of plastic. Kitchen equipment and utensils are also made of plastic. We are surrounded by plastic everywhere.  There many benefits to using plastic. Plastic is lighter than wood or metal, it is also cheaper to buy and produce. Plastic is also flexible, moisture-temperature-chemical resistant, durable and relatively inexpensive. There are also important roles that durable plastics play in certain settings such as hospitals and for computers, phones, safety and industrial equipment. In this article, I will show you how to reduce plastic consumption so that you can do your part to reduce the toxic and health-related illnesses that are plaguing us because of the chemicals in plastic.				"
10,Is Time a Friend or an Enemy?,Home-and-Family,"
					The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were locked in a hopeless Mexican standoff. She was effectively arguing her side of the issue and I was, well, let's say I was not agreeing. I will not say who won, just that it wasn't me. She then looked at me, put both hands on her hips and said, ""Time will tell that I'm right."" I cannot wait. The problem is, time is never on my side. I simply do not know what it is about time, but it never does me any favors. Always, and I mean always, time proves my wife was right. I hate it. I thought it was supposed to be ""Father Time"" we are dealing with. If it is, he certainly does not have the male side of the issue in good grips. Why has time always proven my wife right? Perhaps Mother Nature has so bullied Father Time that he always takes up the side of my wife. The past week I have been thinking about this aspect of life; time. It seems that for the most part, we have put a lot of pressure upon time.				"

12,"I Miss My Good Friend, Tom Foolery",Home-and-Family,"
					This past week the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were having a conversation. Of course, it was more like a monologue, but you know how that works. We were thinking back over the years of our life together and reminding ourselves of some of the great and wonderful times we have had. The friends we have made. The activities we have enjoyed together. Of course, there were the grandchildren and my wife had a great time talking about the grandchildren and I chuckling along with her. After a moment of quietness, my wife said rather seriously, ""Who is the friend you miss the most?"" Boy, was that a question! I had to really think about that, then I mention somebody she knew and we moved on to another subject. However, thinking about that a little bit later I did acknowledge that the friend I missed the most was Tom Foolery. I guess, as you get older you more or less outgrow that friendship. But I certainly do miss him.				"

14,What Is the Best Way to Potty Train Your Toddler in the Shortest Span of Time?,Home-and-Family,"
					You can do it Trust us, potty training is not really very hard and stressful when you do it correctly. There have been cases where even the first time and single moms even without even having the dad to help out in the house, have been able to potty train their toddler within a week's time or even less. You can do it too.				"
15,"Have Mouth, Will Stutter",Home-and-Family,"
					I pride myself with the ability to express myself with the proper wording. I enjoy words and seeing how they relate one to another. Unfortunately, it has not always been the case. I have found through the years that I have developed quite the art of stuttering. It happens at the most inconvenient moments. It is like the story of Honest Abe Lincoln and his wife. The story is not true of course, but it is very interesting. Mrs. Lincoln asks Honest Abe, ""Does this dress make me look fat?"" Known as ""Honest Abe"" we all chuckle at that moment of stuttering for him. I have had such moments of my own. For example, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I might be sitting in the living room watching TV and all the time the person on the other couch is chattering. Me, I am not listening, just smiling and nodding my head in agreement. That has cost me quite a bit throughout the years.				"
16,"Now, Do You Feel Like a Big Boy?",Home-and-Family,"
					Vacations mean different things to different people. For me, the vacation means I am vacating one place and going to another place to do nothing. Recently, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and me vacated the parsonage to go to some place where we could major on doing nothing. We have mastered this over the years. My definition of ""nothing"" is quite different from my wife's definition. My definition is simply that I spend the day doing nothing. My wife's definition is simply that she will spend the day doing nothing but thrift store shopping. At this point, I am not quite sure who has mastered their ""nothing."" We might be equal at this point. As long as each of our ""nothing"" activity does not collide with each other. One of the aspects of getting to that ""nothing"" point is travel. The older I get, the less fond I am of traveling especially long distances. But if we are going to get to our destination, travel is part of the activity.				"
17,The End of All Nonsense and Other Practical Jokes,Home-and-Family,"
					When it comes to practical jokes, Yours Truly is always on the ready. Throughout my earthly passage, I have perpetuated my share of practical jokes. I will not enumerate them here, the simple reason being, I might want to bring one out of retirement. I must say that most practical jokes are neither practical nor funny. However, I operate on the biblical premise, ""A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones"" (Proverbs 17:22). With the high cost of medicine these days, I will take a merry heart every time. Just call me Dr. Merry Heart, and I will dispense some good medicine to everybody who needs it. Now, the practical joke I am thinking of has to do with New Year's Resolutions. I always look forward to the last week in January for this very reason. For the first several weeks of January, I am nervous and sweating over those lousy New Year's Resolutions I am forced to make. Pardon my French. Somewhere there is someone laughing at all of those stupid enough to make New Year's Resolutions.				"
18,It Was An Apple Fritter Kind Of Week,Home-and-Family,"
					Have you ever had a week where everything went exactly as planned? Neither have I. Every week I start out believing this week is going to be different from all the other weeks of my life. If this has ever occurred, I cannot recall it. Take last week, please! I start every week about the same. I meticulously prepare my weekly to-do-list. This is not to be confused with the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage's honey-do-list. Her list, and I learned this by experience, takes precedence over every other list in the world. My weekly to-do-list is a very important part of my week. I chronicle everything needing accomplished during the week along with appointments with people that I need to see. With the religious ferocity of the Pharisee, I follow this list throughout the week and dutifully check off each item as it is completed. Then, Saturday evening I can look back with a great deal of satisfaction and see what I have accomplished.				"
19,I Thought But Then I Unthought,Home-and-Family,"
					Looking back over my life I honestly can say, giving it a great deal of thought, the biggest problem I have is when I actually think. Thinking can get me into more trouble than anything else I do. This was no more evident than recently we got a phone call from the bank. I hate it when the bank calls because they never call to wish me happy birthday or wonder how in the world I am doing today. They always have an agenda. Usually, that agenda has to do with my money. When I answered the phone all I could say was, ""Here we go again."" Much to my relief it was not about my account, but rather it was the bank account of the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. I cannot tell you the smile that slapped itself all over my face when I heard this. Immediately I called my wife to the phone and said, ""It's your bank calling you about your account."" Smilingly I handed the phone to her.				"

					So often I hear family members complain about how others make a mess and are not willing to help with the cleanup. They want things done a certain way at a certain time and feel upset, blaming everyone else who lives in the house for this mood. When they come to me as clients, they believe that I have magic powers that will instantly change everyone but don't expect what I have to say about their dilemma.				"
1,"Oh Wisdom, Wherefore Art Thou",Home-and-Family,"
					One feature of the Christmas story has to do with the wise men. I'm not sure if there were three or not, but if there were I should like to be number four. Wisdom is such a rare commodity today I think it would be a wise thing to resurrect these wise men. After all, you never can have too much wisdom. I was thinking about this the other day as I was going over my weekly ""to-do-list."" I make one of these every week so I know what I'm supposed to do. As I finish one task, I check it off in red ink. It's not that I don't do a lot of things during the week, it's simply that I sometimes don't do the things that I plan to do for the week. I certainly am not like the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage who has a PhD in planning. I know that if I don't make my own plans and write them down, she will be glad to assist me. Looking at her ""to-do-list,"" makes me dizzy. How she can do so much in one week is beyond my understanding, and frankly, I don't want to understand.				"

If you want to get your financial life in order in 2019 here are a few examples of achievable, actionable goals.				"
3,Be Sure Your Grin Will Find You Out,Home-and-Family,"
					Christmas is a wonderful time of the year and I appreciate it so very much. I recognize I'm difficult to purchase presents for because I have my books, my pens, what else do I really need? Once in a while I get a Christmas present to beat all Christmas presents. This year was one of those ""once in a while's."" It's a pretty well known fact that the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and myself differs when it comes to culinary likes and dislikes. How we got along for so many years is truly a miracle, I suppose. She, for example, loves vegetables, particularly broccoli. (Excuse me, I need to go and wash out my mouth.) On the other side of the table, I love Apple Fritters. (Excuse me, I need to relish the thought of an apple fritter.)				"
4,"Ha, Ha, I Knew I Was Right!",Home-and-Family,"
					Did you ever experience a time when you were right and had the evidence to prove you were right? I know that for me, it does not happen very often. In fact, I cannot think of a time that it really did happen to me. Well, until recently. I want to remember this incident as long as I live. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage was preparing for our Thanksgiving family get-together. It takes her weeks to get everything prepared; she is so meticulous and will not allow anything to go wrong from her point of view. Everything has to be done just so. Experience has taught me during this time of the year to stay out of the kitchen! That is why I am still living to this very day. However, it does have its advantages. I can relax in my ""man cave"" and stay out of her way. I know that if I ever get in her way she always, without exception, has a job for me to do. I like working, but not under those circumstances. If she cannot see me, she cannot give me work to do.				"
5,It Was a Gobble-Gobble Kind of Day,Home-and-Family,"
					I do not know about anybody else, but I truly enjoy Thanksgiving Day. It is not just because of the turkey that the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage prepares so brilliantly, although, I cannot think of any other reason. Of course, there is the idea of family getting together. I enjoy that all the time. I like to hear the stories and get caught up with the latest happenings that have to do with my family. I remember years ago good old Uncle Bud was my favorite uncle. He could tell a story that was so unbelievable that you ended up believing him. Even today, I can remember some of the stories that he would tell and I could see now that he was exaggerating very well. I guess it's in our family. So, it is wonderful to get together with family and get up-to-date with all the happenings in our family.				"
6,Kitty On The Outside Or A Tree Frog On The Inside,Home-and-Family,"
					I thought, which is a dangerous activity for me, that I had pulled one over on the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. It is a rare occasion when I actually do something like this. At my age, I assume I could get away with something. I guess I am just not old enough. Several weeks ago, I happened to look out the back window and saw a kitty walking across our back yard. A little idea sneaked into my head. Maybe I could get some kitty treats and feed the kitty. It is not that my wife does not like kitties; she just does not like them on our property. No way she would ever, and I mean ever, condone some kitty living on our property. However, my thought was, what if she does not know? I have always heard that what your wife doesn't know can't hurt you. So, I put together a very sneaky plan.				"
7,Not Everything in Life Is Automatic,Home-and-Family,"
					Two days in the year I don't like. Somebody is thinking it is my wife's birthday and our wedding anniversary. I worked that out a long time ago. My birthday is two days before the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and our anniversary is three weeks after our birthday. No way can I forget that. When my wife gives me a birthday card with some gift it reminds me that I have two days to reciprocate. And reciprocate, I do very well. I love it when a plan comes together. I remember my wife's birthday and I remember our wedding anniversary, but more often than not, I cannot remember the years. I do not know how old my wife is. At least, that's my story. And, I am not sure how long we've been married. I know we have been married long enough to work out many things.				"
8,Why Did I Ever Grow Up?,Home-and-Family,"
					At times, I have to do some errands for the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. It's not that I like to do these errands, but I have learned this is one secret to getting along with her. The errand she had for me was to go to the Mall and pick up something she had ordered. In my own way I tried to finagle out of that errand, but the more I finagled the more insistent she was. So, I decided to finagle no more. As the pop song says, ""I have a million reasons not to go, give me one reason to go."" I tried to play this on her and her response was, ""Because I asked you to."" You just cannot get any better than that. I know, because I have tried. Since I do not go to the mall that often, I thought I would stop in at a coffee shop and have myself a cup of coffee and just chill out a little. Taking my coffee out in the main area of the mall, I sat in one of the lounge chairs and watched the people go by.				"
9,I'm Dreaming of a Commercial Free World,Home-and-Family,"
					It was one of those really busy weeks where there was hardly enough time to breathe. For myself, I was glad the week was over and I could relax for the evening. ""What do you want for supper?"" The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage queried. ""Do you want to go out for supper?"" Going out for supper was the last thing on my mind. All I wanted to do was relax here at the house. ""No,"" I said rather hesitatingly, ""why don't we just order a pizza and stay home tonight?"" That brought a nice smile to her face. It is the one time that I made the right decision. So, we ordered the pizza and were ready to settle down and enjoy the evening together watching TV. Nothing could be more relaxing after the kind of week we had. It was like two steps forward and five steps backward.				"
10,Game Day Can Take Your Wallet to New Lows,Home-and-Family,"
					If you are a football fan you know it can get a little pricey. Whether you are enjoying the game at home, at the stadium or at a sports bar, the season activities can break the bank. Is it possible to be a dedicated football fan without dishing out major bucks? We have some recommendations for locking in a budgeting touchdown while enjoying the rest of the season.				"
11,Is It a Fragrance or a Stench?,Home-and-Family,"
					This past week I had to go to the mall. I know, I should know better, but I thought I could sneak in, get what I needed and sneak out again. So much for my thoughts. I wanted to purchase several tie chains for my neckties and searched every jewelry store and nobody had them. Finally, I ordered three online, which would be shipped free, (which always gets my attention) to the nearest store, which happened to be in the mall. I do not like the mall and choose not to go there if I can help it. When in the mall, I am usually very nervous and get confused and do not know which way I am going. Once I get in, I am not quite sure how to get out again. Everything seems to be contrived to confuse a person like myself. Looking down at the ground while walking I became rather confused and I happen to turn into an open door. My mall savvy is not sophisticated in the least.				"
12,Here's My Hammer If You Need It,Home-and-Family,"
					I am not known as ""Mr. Fix-It Man"". When it comes to mechanical things, I am really handy-challenged. I can do many things, but I cannot fix anything. When talking about the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage, it is a different story. If there is something she cannot fix then it isn't broken. No matter what is broken or how long it has been broken, she somehow can fix it. I do not know how she does it, and believe me, I am not going to ask. There is nothing I cannot break and there is nothing she cannot fix. We make a wonderful team as long as I keep that scenario in my mind. If I, for whatever reason, think I can fix something, I am in deep trouble. The more I try to fix something, the more broken it becomes. I have learned long ago to own up to this in my life. I think it is wonderful to know what you cannot do. That eliminates trying to do something and failing every time. It is more wonderful to know who can fix what you break.				"
13,Home Has Never Been Sweeter,Home-and-Family,"
					If the good Lord ever intended me to travel as much as I have been traveling, I'm sure He would have given me wings. I like the idea of traveling; it is the actual traveling that gets me. The only good thing about traveling is that home looks so good from so far away. Several years ago, I received an invitation to speak at a conference. It sounded like a great idea at the time. I have been there before and have had a wonderful time. The thing about this trip was it was the same week my son and daughter-in-law were expecting their fifth baby, which would have been our ninth grandchild. Whether it is the first or the ninth grandchild makes no difference whatsoever to those creatures called grandmothers. When the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage learned of my plans and that the conference I would be speaking at was in close proximity to the ninth grandchild, which was the end of the story. Plans for ""our"" travel began. According to her, I could drop her off at my son's house and continue to my conference.				"
14,Inter-Generational Fun,Home-and-Family,"
					INTER-GENERATIONAL FUN! I had such a wonderful long weekend! My grandson, Justin, who is nineteen years of age, called and asked if he could come for a visit.				"
15,"If This Is Autumn, What Was Summer?",Home-and-Family,"
					I must confess that in the Parsonage there are times of confusion. It has nothing to do with age; it has everything to do with the human brain that is undernourished. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage can say one thing and I can say something completely different. There are those rare occasions when we are on the same page, the same sentence and almost the same words. Those occasions do not come as often as I would like. The good news is, we are all on the same book, which makes the difference. The other day, for example, I was in a panic mode. I was trying to get stuff done and was not making progress. Finally, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said, ""What are you in such a fuss about?"" ""Well,"" I said rather exhaustively, ""it's Friday and I'm trying to get my work done."" My wife just stood there looking at me with one of those ""looks"" she is most famous for. Then, placing both hands on her hips, she said, ""Silly boy, don't you know it's Thursday?""				"
16,Financial Tip Of The Week: Pay Attention,Home-and-Family,"
					Enjoying a casual evening at home, reclining in my favorite easy chair reading, while the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage was chatting on the telephone. I seldom pay attention to phone conversations. After all, I only get one side of the conversation, which may be misleading at the very best. I've been caught in that trap before with some pretty dire consequences. I am not going to get caught again, if I can help it. Then an odd phrase caught my attention: ""plastic surgery."" My ears perked up and I heard my wife say, ""I certainly agree with that article and I'm going to do some plastic surgery myself."" Well, you can imagine what thoughts were racing through my head. When she hung up the telephone, I queried her about it. In my book, plastic surgery is a big step. ""You do support me in this plastic surgery plan, don't you?""				"
17,Where's Sherlock Holmes When You Need Him?,Home-and-Family,"
					I, like so many people, love a good mystery. I have read all of the Sherlock Holmes stories, the Father Brown stories and other good mystery novels. I just like trying to solve a good mystery. A good mystery does not reveal the mystery until the very end. All the way through the story, importance evidence points to that person and the other person and so forth. However, you must read the end of the story to find out the answer to the mystery. Mysteries do not just exist in novels for short stories. In my case, mysteries are all through my life. I cannot manage one day without some kind of a mystery. It is not because I am getting older either. As I remember my younger days, it too was filled with mysteries. I remember that one Christmas Eve when I was going to solve the mystery of Santa Claus. I heard about this mysterious person, but I had never seen him and this Christmas, I promised myself, I am going to see who this Santa Claus really is.				"
18,Slow Is Just the Way I Go,Home-and-Family,"
					One of the main complaints in the Parsonage has to do with my procrastination. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage often refers to me as, Sir Procrastinator, as if it was a bad thing. Anything that needs doing in our house, my wife is the first one to jump up and try to do it. She fixes things before they are even broken. How she does that, I will never know. It is a wife thing. I, on the other hand, am slower than a politician trying to explain him or herself. For some reason, I was born in no hurry and that has been my motto all of my life. I am really not in a hurry for anything. I take my time, relax whenever possible and just do not get excited about anything. I have found out that when I get excited about something and want to go fast forward, I always get into trouble. Trouble has become my middle name in this regard.				"
19,How to Live With a Veggie-Holic,Home-and-Family,"
					In our house, not many conflicts expose themselves. For the most part, it is a very quiet and serene home occupied by two lovebirds. I am not saying we are perfect. For we are not. The imperfect side of this marvelous relationship is Yours Truly. I was born imperfect and I have honored my birthright ever since. I do not care what some may say about crazy people, I have enjoyed my craziness all my life. When you are perfect, you have to be careful that you do not make any mistake or act crazy. When, however, you are imperfect and tilt towards the crazy side of life, your life is a joy. If you make a mistake, well, that is part of life. But on the positive side, when you do something right, you become the amazement of people around you.				"

0,Laughter in Any Other Language Is Just Not Funny,Home-and-Family,"
					When I was in high school, I played on the volleyball team. During one practice session, I forgot to bring my sneakers. Not thinking much of it, I just played anyway. During the practice, I stepped forward to protect the player on the front line and when he jumped, he came down on my right foot. The consequence was he smashed my big toe. That little incident put me out of the volleyball team for the rest of the season. I had to go to the doctor and have him fix my toe. I had to go several times for him to fix it. Consequently, my toenail on my right foot grew in crooked. It has been a painful thing ever since. For years, I took care of it, but not too long ago I was doing more damage than help and I did not know what to do about it.				"
1,If It Wasn't for Bad Luck,Home-and-Family,"
					I am not the kind of person that dabbles in luck. [Knock on wood.] When something looks like a good gamble to me, I run from it as fast as I can. If it looks too good to be true, believe me, it probably is not true. Luck has never been a friend of mine. The only luck I have ever had in life is when I conned a young lady into saying, ""I do."" That was 47 years ago and I have never had a luckier moment since. Each year I appreciate that lucky moment more. Apart from that, I am not on the lucky side of the road. It is not that I would not appreciate a lucky moment every now and again. It is just that I am not the lucky kind of a person that gets that kind of thing.				"
2,10 Ways to Save on Renters Insurance,Home-and-Family,"
					When renting a new place there are so many things to think about and arrange, so often times renters insurance does not make the list. In fact, only 41% of renters obtain renters insurance. Sometimes it is the amount of things already on the agenda that distract from the importance of renters insurance, but sometimes it is due to the lack of understanding. So, what exactly is renters insurance? Renters insurance is insurance to cover stolen or damaged belongings, since you are not covered under your landlord's building insurance for these things. It also covers temporary living expenses and liability/medical bills.				"
3,"Hallelujah, It IS a Trick",Home-and-Family,"
					I know I am not the sharpest pencil in the drawer, or the brightest bulb on the porch, and a few bricks shy of a load. However, my philosophy is simple, if you know what you are not, then you can soon figure out what you really are. If somebody can't con me, they can't con anybody. I admit that I am na√Øve about many things. A Girl Scout needs only smile, wink her brown eyes at me and I will buy all the cookies she has. My problem is, I have a hard time believing anyone would lie to me. Why would someone lie in the first place? What does lying get you? An incident happened this past week that sucked me into that whirlpool of naivety. I received an email from somebody who wanted to give me a lot of money. It seems this woman was recently widowed and her husband was very wealthy and she wanted to give money to some charity. Would I be interested in receiving money?				"
4,I Never Thought I Could,Home-and-Family,"
					As a person gets older things change. By things, I am referring to my body. When I was young, I never gave a thought to what it would be like when I got old. I was too busy enjoying my being young. What young person wants to waste their time thinking about what they are going to be when they are old? However, as a person gets older there is more time to think about things. To think about your health and strength and is it time to go to bed yet? I can remember as a young person my parents had to wrestle me into my bed to go to sleep at night. I never wanted to go to bed; I wanted to stay up all night and watch TV. I tried to think of many reasons not to go to bed when I was younger. Now that I'm older, I'm trying to think of many reasons TO go to bed early.				"

7,I Think I Now Know How Noah Felt,Home-and-Family,"
					Looking out the living room window the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage sighed very deeply and said, ""When will this stinking rain stop?"" I chuckled to myself very carefully not to let it come up to the surface of my face to let on to anybody in the room. She turned around and said to me, ""I am just about done with all this rain."" With a fake grimace on my face I said, ""I don't know, but I'm done with it too."" I had to walk away at that point because I could not control the chuckles that were rising to the level of my face. When I got some control of my emotions I thought to myself, this must be how Noah felt. Whenever it rains as it has been doing lately, I usually think of Noah. Only this time I was thinking of Noah's wife.				"

9,Apple Fritter: The Fruit of My Choice,Home-and-Family,"
					Our country, so it seems, runs on choice. The more choices we have, the better we like it. Most people in America pride themselves on the ability to make their own choices. ""Freedom of Choice,"" is the cry you hear all around our country these days. Yet, most people do not have the freedom of choice they think they have. Somebody is influencing the choices they make without them realizing they are being influenced. That is called marketing. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were watching television the other night, trying to watch a favorite TV program. Finally, from an end of the room that was not my end, came an exasperated sigh. I tried to ignore it, but you know how that works. The exasperation seemed to accelerate and I knew that if I did not acknowledge it in some way, well, I think you know what would happen.				"
10,2 Reasons Why You Should Not Wish to Be a Last-Born,Home-and-Family,"

11,I Fell for It Again,Home-and-Family,"
					An old saying more or less defines my life, ""What we learn from history is that we don't learn from history."" When I was younger, I assumed that the older I got, the smarter I would become. I have not achieved that at this point in my life. It gets so tiresome to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. I do hope though, that this will change somewhere along my life. I am hoping it changes before I die. I was reminded of this flaw in my personality several weeks ago when the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I spent a little bit of vacation time at St. Augustine. Someone had given us tickets for several nights in a bed and breakfast. We spent the whole week just enjoying ourselves. I should correct that though. I spent the whole week reading and meditating with my eyes closed.				"

					I have had enough of some things. There are, however, some things I can never have enough. Apple fritters and coffee are things I can never have enough of. I would never use the word ""enough"" with these words. Some things are in this category of ""I've Had Enough."" Recently, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said, ""Your birthday is coming up. What do you want to do for your birthday?"" I looked at her like I have never looked at her before and said, ""Enough, I've had enough of birthdays I don't want another birthday."" She looked at me, laughed like usual and said, ""Silly boy, everybody has a birthday."" In a way, I guess she is right, but I have had enough birthdays and I do not want another birthday.				"

15,What Do You Mean It's Time to Go Home?,Home-and-Family,"
					We had just started our vacation, or so I thought, when the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said, ""Hurry up; it's time to go home."" I have been married to my wife for almost 46 years and during that time, she has always teased me and tried to get my goat. My goat has long been gotten. So, I thought she was trying to tease me about our vacation time. As she said that, I noticed she was packing her suitcase. That was just strange. She is really going all out to fool me into thinking it is time to go home. I, however, know better and cannot be fooled even by her. I laughed most heartily and said, ""That's a good one, but you can't fool me. We're on vacation."" When she was planning the vacation, it took her quite a while to convince me we were going on vacation. I get so caught up in ""life,"" that I often do not realize I need to take a break every once in a while. However, when I take a break, I Take a Break.				"
16,The Parsonage Kitchen Shutdown Threat,Home-and-Family,"
					A certain situation has been building in the Parsonage for the last several months. At first, I did not think it too serious but alas, we have reached a terrible impasse. It started a few months ago when I came home, walked into the house and was hit in the face so hard I almost passed out. At the time, I was hoping I would pass out, but no such luck. I think everybody knows what it is like to be hit unexpectedly by something you do not actually expect. I guess that is why it is called unexpectedly. It happened to me and I am not sure I am over it yet. Even though I have been married 46 years, of which most of it has been happily, I did not see this one coming. Just when you think you have your spouse figured out, they do something off the radar. Every husband knows exactly what I am talking about.				"

					I had just finished my project, sent it to my publisher, took a deep breath and said out loud, ""I'm glad that's done. Now I can rest for a while."" I must have said it aloud for someone in the house heard it. I need to explain that with the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage, it does not matter if you say it aloud, mumble it under your breath or just think it, she hears it. I do not know how she does it and she will not give me her secret. ""So,"" my wife said rather suspiciously, ""ready to go on our vacation?"" I stuttered a little bit and said, ""A what?"" That ""V"" word rarely resides between my two ears. I just never think of it. I am not a vacation fan. Sure, when the kids were home it was nice to get away and have some fun with them. However, that has been a long time ago. I think someone my age is just too old to go on vacation. What would be the purpose?				"
1,A Merry Heart Doeth Good,Home-and-Family,"
					With all the sad news in our country today, it is about time for some good news. However, the way things are going I am not going to hold my breath. We just finished supper and the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I was watching a little bit of television. We like to try to catch up on the news after a day of working. I well remember the time when the ""world news"" was only broadcast for 30 minutes, which was broken up by commercials. It is hard to get all the news that is worth hearing together for 30 minutes. Back in ""the day,"" the commentators were able to do it. At least we did not hear about all the news of the day, which was a blessing.				"
2,A Key On the Table Is Worth Many A Chuckle,Home-and-Family,"
					When it comes to forgetting anything, I am king of the hill. My forgetting has nothing to do with age because I have been forgetting as long as I can remember. Of course, with age comes an excuse for forgetting something. Don't let anybody know this, but sometimes I use my age to say I forgot something which in reality I had not forgotten. Sometimes forgetting something is the best expression of valor. I can't remember all the things I have forgotten, however, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage remembers everything, even things I did not forget. Her memory is impeccable and I just have to live with it. Often she will start a conversation with, ""Do you remember... ?"" Being married as long as I have, I always go with the affirmative nod, which I never forget to do.				"

4,What Would We Do Without Rain?,Home-and-Family,"
					Sometimes I cannot help being a grouch. I guess it is what happens to a person when they get older. They get older, grouchier and grumpier. With that in mind, I guess I qualify for being an old geezer. The past several weeks I was grouchy about the weather. What else is there to grouch about these days? I would grouch about politics, but it is a world of craziness. I suppose good people go to Washington, DC, but they don't stay good for long. Therefore, I have given up grouching about politics and politicians and such. One of the good things about grouching about the weather is it there is nothing you can do about the weather. You may not like the weather. You may want a different kind of weather. However, there is actually nothing you can do to change the weather on the outside.				"
5,"Tidy Up Tuesday - Hang In There, It Does Get Better",Home-and-Family,"
					I'll bet that doesn't give you a warm and fuzzy feeling to hear that, does it? I don't blame you.

You'll wish you never took the stuff, and yet the promise is, once you give it some time, you'll feel amazing.				"

The Aspirin's acetylsalicylic acid will combine with the battery's sulphuric acid to produce one last charge.

9,"Ode to a Mother's Love, Wisdom and Care",Home-and-Family,"
					My wife and I argued recently. To be honest, I upset her with something I said, and, though I knew it in the moment, I allowed conflict to ensue, not that she fought. She simply protected herself, which she had every right to do, giving me time to reflect. I soon apologised, and we moved on. But as I reflected, I discovered something about my wife that is generally true of all women, and I feel led to share that, particularly in the light of Mother's Day.				"

11,Fall From Grace,Home-and-Family,"
					I raised on a farm just outside a remote village nestled like a shirt button in a valley on the Canadian Shield. Most of the wage-earners in this Northern Ontario community worked at nearby nickel mines. My childhood was relatively normal until one autumn afternoon when I was twelve. Forty-five years later, the horror I witnessed that day still haunts me. My mother, who turns ninety this year, likely has no recollection of the event. Nor would she be aware of the psychological trauma she inflicted on me. My perception of my sweet, loving maman was crushed, never to be the same.				"
12,"I Enjoy a Mess, Especially Mine",Home-and-Family,"
					The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were in a little bit of a tussle this past week. Normally (whoever said I was normal) I stay away from such activity in our very humble domicile. Sometimes it is completely unavoidable. This was one of those times. I was in the study area of our home doing some kind of work when my wife came in, looked around with both hands on her hips and said, ""What is all of this mess about?"" At first, I didn't quite understand what she was talking about. In fact, I usually don't understand what she's talking about first off. Experience has taught me that if I just nod in the affirmative and smile the problem will go away. This time it didn't go away.				"
13,How to Trick Summer Into Coming Early,Home-and-Family,"
					Just when you think summer has come, winter giggles and sticks her icy nose into my life. Not being much of a fan of winter I can stand it for so long, but not as long as it's been this year. Either I'm getting old and cannot remember or this has been a very long winter. Shivering is not my favorite activity, although it's the only activity I get to do lately. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were talking; rather she was talking and I was listening. That is what makes us a great pair. She talks, I listen and our world goes rolling on. What she was talking about was summer. ""When,"" she asked, ""will summer really get here?"" Of course, we can look at the calendar and pick out a date when summer is going to get here, but it is like playing the lottery, which I believe is rigged. I think picking the date of summer is rigged as well. I like to know who has rigged it because I would like to give them a piece of my wife's mind.				"
14,My Somber Longing for Summer,Home-and-Family,"
					My favorite time of the year is summer and I don't care what the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage says. Summer is what I live for especially here in Florida. As soon as Fall arrives in full steam I am looking forward to summer with uncontrollable anticipation. One thing that attracts me to summer has to do with the weather. I don't like cold because I'm growing too old now to shiver properly. When it is cold and I am supposed to be shivering, I don't have the energy. I admit that I don't have the energy I had a few years back. Let's not talk about how many years back. Shivering now is really not part of my exercise program.				"

0,Spring Has Sprung a Leak This Year,Home-and-Family,"
					It was in the middle of February during a very shivering cold time that the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said most dramatically, ""I can't wait for Spring. When in the world is Spring going to get here?"" As a veteran husband, I knew this was not a question for me to ponder or even to answer. Rather, it was something I needed to ignore completely. I learned these things down the years, which is why I have survived so many years. If silence is golden then I have reached those golden years of life. I wouldn't say this to her, but I was thinking the same thing myself. When is Spring ever going to get here? I was counting the days when it would be Spring and we could enjoy some graciously warm weather for a change. This weather has been stinking chilly for a long time and I was getting tired of it. I could tell my wife was getting tired of it too, but I didn't want to go in that direction with any kind of conversation. Sometimes the best thing to do is not do or say anything.				"
1,"When I'm Beside Myself, I'm in Bad Company",Home-and-Family,"
					In the beginning of the week the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said, ""On Thursday the girls and I will be going to St. Augustine for the day to visit thrift shops."" It was spring break and so the girls did not have school. It was the perfect opportunity for an outing for them. ""Do you think,"" she asked, ""you'll be able to handle the day without me?"" I laughed, but not too hard, and said, ""I think so. Just go and have a wonderful time in St. Augustine."" That was Monday and when Thursday came, I was drinking my morning coffee and my wife came in and said, ""Well, it's time for us to go. Are you sure you'll be able to take care of yourself today?""				"
2,Can I Get An Amen?,Home-and-Family,"
					An interesting aspect to people is their proclivity toward hypocrisy. By that I mean we say one thing but we really do not mean it or it does not really apply to us personally. I was complaining about this to the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage this past week. ""Why is it,"" I said most curiously, ""people really don't mean what they say?"" She responded by saying, ""I always mean what I say."" Being the kind of husband that I am, I refused to contradict her reply. Therefore, I am not referring to her in these comments. People just don't say what they mean.				"
3,Wishing Can Be Hazardous to Your Health,Home-and-Family,"
					The last several months have been rather busy with hardly a break anywhere. Sometimes the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I get so busy we forget about the necessity of taking a break every now and then. Soon one day becomes just like the last day. And tomorrow? Will be just like today. We did take a little break and went out for supper one evening at one of our favorite restaurants. This has become a rather rare occasion and so we tried to enjoy the moment as much as we could. We were chit chatting and enjoying our company as the waitress brought our food to us. It was a delicious meal and I was beginning to enjoy myself, maybe just a little too much.				"
4,That's How You Learn to Err,Home-and-Family,"
					When my eldest son began to ride a bike, I used the ""patent"" my father used to teach me how to ride: inserting a broom stick between the rear luggage seat and the bicycle' body, in order to balance the rider. I was not the only parent who risked his back, huffed and puffed - and hurt his child's learning experience. When I sensed that the boy reached balance, I pulled out the broom stick and prayed he wouldn't crash.				"

9,"Oh, Dem Golden Tones Of Silence",Home-and-Family,"
					Last Saturday evening the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and Yours Truly were reclining on the living room sofa enjoying our evening cup of coffee. It is a wonderful way to unwind after a week of activity. No matter how hectic the week was, a few quiet moments with a cup of Joe can put everything in perspective. After an extended time of silence my wife spoke. ""Listen. Do you hear that?"" ""Hear what?"" I enquired. ""That. Don't you hear it?"" The smile on her face indicated that what she was hearing was rather pleasing.				"
10,A Bug on the Plate Is Worth How Much?,Home-and-Family,"
					Did you ever have a smile on your face that no matter what you did you could not wipe it off? Well, that is quite a regular occurrence with me. But this past week was a ""smile-on-the-face"" to beat all ""smiles-on-the-face."" My only regret is that I did not do a Selfie. It all began in the morning when I suggested that we go out for lunch for a pre-Valentine's Day celebration. Sometimes with our schedule we cannot celebrate a celebration on that celebration day. Of course, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage responded in the positive. ""You,"" she said rather sarcastically, ""will be picking up the check?"" ""It's the least,"" I said in response, ""I can do for your Valentine's Day present."" Smilingly she said, ""It sure is the least thing you could do.""				"

					Time is a strange thing, if you ask me. Even though I wear a wristwatch every day, most of the time I do not know what time it really is. And for that matter, how important is time? It came to me in a strange way this past week. I went to bed as normal in the evening. Once we had the grandchildren over and I discovered the difference between grandchildren and grandparents. Grandchildren try to come up with as many excuses not to go to bed while grandparents come up with excuses to go to bed early. I thought I was having a wonderful time sleeping when all of a sudden I began hearing strange noises and I could not figure out what it was. I thought I was just dreaming. Then there was an explosion in the bedroom and I jumped out of bed and noticed it was the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage who had turned on the light and was saying, ""Come on and get up. We don't want to be late.""				"
16,Why Families Are Crumbling,Home-and-Family,"
					The old and conservative concept of family is fast crumbling before our very eyes.

But in the so-called advanced world, it is as good as gone.				"

19,"Back in the Saddle Again, And Again",Home-and-Family,"
					This is not my first rodeo when it comes to New Years. I have ridden this Bronco so many times I cannot remember how many. Well, I can remember, but I am not going to let that slip. Something to do with a New Year's Resolution. Back in the days of youth, I used to stay up to watch the New Year's Eve ball drop. Now, I see so many people drop the ball during the year that I don't want to see another one on New Year's Eve. I've seen enough of that. At my stage in life, health is more important than watching something I have seen a thousand times before. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage agrees with me on this issue. It is one of the few issues that we agree on so why should I mess with it.				"

2,The Year Slipped Into the Silence of the Night,Home-and-Family,"
					No time in the year is busier than the Christmas holiday season. Under normal circumstances, it would not be too bad, except for the fact that the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage is in charge. Not complaining, mind you, but she is in charge 365 days out of the year. Her battery never runs down and never needs charging. I am glad she is like that because it gives me less to do during such busy holiday times. She knows exactly what she is going to do and how she is going to do it and when she is going to do it. My job during the holiday season is to Stay Out Of Her Way. However, the hustle and the bustle of the holiday season is over and for a minute or two, we can relax. I never know when that time comes. Like I got up early the other morning and heard from the other side of the bed, ""What are you getting up for? Don't you know Christmas is over?""				"
3,Friends or Family - A Risky Gamble,Home-and-Family,"
					Remember as a teenager you would probably ask your parent(s) to ""borrow"" money to go to the mall, movies or purchase something you admired for what seemed like forever. With this request, you probably were greeted with responses like: 'I will give you some of the money, but you must earn the rest' or 'How are you going to pay me back the money you are borrowing"". I am not sure why the word borrow was often used but let's be real, how often did you really pay your parents back.				"
4,Nice Is a Matter of Perspective,Home-and-Family,"
					Sitting in the living room the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and me were enjoying some hot apple cider tea and listening to some Christmas music. The song came that referred to Santa's nice list and naughty list. I was not paying too much of attention, but somebody else in the room was. ""Do you think you are on,"" my wife said rather sarcastically, ""Santa's nice list or naughty list?"" I always get trapped by such questions. I have been married long enough to know that questions are not posed to get an answer, but rather to get someone in trouble, mainly me. I did not want to answer that question and I didn't know how to get away from it. Suddenly the answer came to me.				"
5,Layer Your Bed,Home-and-Family,"

6,Black Friday Always Results in Red Monday,Home-and-Family,"
					I'm not sure who come up with this term ""Black Friday"" but I am definitely not for it. To me, Black Friday is rather devious and I know the only purpose is to get their teeth into my money, which is a sacred area to me. When it comes to shopping, I certainly am not a fan. I really do not like shopping. I get nervous when I'm in the shopping mall, start sweating and have to leave and sit in my car for at least half an hour to regain composure. I have many interests and passions in life, but trust me, shopping is not one of them. I can live my whole life without ever shopping. On the other side of our residence, it is a different story.				"
7,When Your World Falls Apart!,Home-and-Family,"
					Sometimes things don't go to plan! I have been planning my future for years. When my friend and partner and I retired we would buy a house in Spain and a caravan for summer months in England when the climate became too hot. The day came when we found a beautiful 3 bedroom house where we spent last winter. What a mild winter, beautiful sunny beaches, virtually deserted, sand and sea stretching for miles. Meals on the patio it was all great. Then disaster struck I tripped and fell when walking and fractured my knee. In time this healed and we returned to our caravan in England where we were enjoying doing the garden and more sunny days. My desire to ovoid cold winters was a success.				"

					A sometimes forgotten piece of your bed linen is the bed skirt. While your eye may not be directed immediately to the bottom of your bed, you may eventually notice that there is in place the bed skirt - or that there isn't one. If there isn't one, you will see the legs of the bed and when the covers are pulled back you will see the box springs under the mattress as well.				"
9,"Poor As I Am, All I Can Give Is Thanks",Home-and-Family,"
					It was a pre-Thanksgiving evening and the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were enjoying some hot cider tea. Nothing goes down quite as nice as a hot cider tea. It was rather a quiet evening and I happened to glance over at my wife and saw her staring into space as it were. It concerned me because I knew that's what she did when she was thinking about something. The problem that faced me was simply this. Was she thinking about me or something else? If it's me, I'm probably in trouble. If it's something else, I'm probably in trouble. No matter which side of the fence I'm on, I'm in trouble.				"

11,"As The Cookie Crumbles, So Do My Excuses",Home-and-Family,"
					Several weeks ago, I was at home alone when the doorbell rang. I answered the door to find representatives from a local Girl Scout troop doing what they do so well; selling Girl Scout cookies. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage was not home so danger was not lurking behind the living room curtains. When Girl Scouts come selling cookies, I am cookie dough in their fund-raising hands. ""Hello, mister,"" they chimed, ""We're selling cookies to raise money for... "" I immediately interrupted and exclaimed, ""Yes, yes, I'll take all you have!"" When the passion of the moment passed, I did not need a fortune cookie to know I was going to be in big trouble with the wife, one tough cookie. Catching me with my hand in the cookie jar is serious business with her.				"
12,This Fall Was a Major Trip for Me,Home-and-Family,"
					This past week the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said to me rather casually, ""I guess you know today is November?"" She's always joking with me and I assumed this was one of her jokes. ""You can't fool me,"" I said quite sarcastically, ""I know it's October."" With that, she led me to the refrigerator where she had a calendar and pointed to me that today was the first day of November.				"
13,Is the Whole World Crazy or Is It Just Me?,Home-and-Family,"
					Driving across town the other day I was nearly hit by four different vehicles. One ran a stop sign, another swerved in front of me and almost hit me and I'm sure the other two were on their cell phones. After a while I begin to think my life was at risk here. I decided to drop into a little coffee shop and cool my heels a little bit. I ordered some coffee, took a table in the corner and just reflected on my day. Why is it, I thought to myself, do people drive so crazy? How do they get a driver's license? Reflecting a little more upon the subject it dawned on me that it is not limited to people driving on the highway. People are just simply crazy.				"

16,Have You Seen My Glasses? And Other Trick Questions,Home-and-Family,"
					The only person who asks more questions than a lawyer is the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. I am not saying that questions are bad, at least not all of them. What I am saying is, some questions can be trick questions. To know the difference between a legitimate question and a trick question takes years of practicing being a husband. If the husband learns anything in his marriage, it is this. I know people ask questions in order to get information. Not all people ask a question in order to get information. Some people ask questions in order to trick somebody into saying something that is compromising.				"
17,How Does One Help the Homeless?,Home-and-Family,"
					A strange thing happened to me a few days ago. A lady put a post on my face book page that just said ""brrrr, it's 40 degrees here now."" Jokingly I said it was also 40 degrees in Australia in some parts, as that is the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit.				"
18,Why Did I Get Up This Morning?,Home-and-Family,"
					All day long, I've had this burning question in my mind. One of those questions you just cannot shake and as the day progressed, it loomed larger and larger until I had to address it. Personally, I would like to have addressed it, put a stamp on it and send it to Timbuktu. I just do not know the ZIP code. It all began first thing in the morning. Some days try to trick you into thinking it's going to be a good day by starting the day off perfect. Such was not the case with this day.				"

2,As High As an Elephant's Eye,Home-and-Family,"
					I have been taking corn for granted for my entire life and never gave it much thought beyond my appetite for it. I was kind of crushed a few weeks ago when my doctor put me on a 30-day diet that excluded corn. But, I put my shoulder to the wheel and I went hard at it. I was delighted when I was able to finish that diet in just 3 days and 11 hours. I was so happy to get back to that ear of white corn on the cob at dinner that night.				"
3,One Good Deed Deserves A Kick In The Pants,Home-and-Family,"
					Have you ever had the feeling that any good deed you try is counteracted by a good swift kick in the pants? I recently grabbed a quick lunch at a local restaurant. I don't like eating at fast food restaurants, but, occasionally, I don't have much choice. Then, once in the restaurant the menu doesn't give me much choice, either. I ordered my lunch and settled at a corner table. About halfway through my lunch an older couple took the table next to me. Being a ""people watcher,"" which is a fancy way of saying, ""I'm nosy,"" I watched this couple out of the corner of my eye. I noticed right away the woman got her things situated immediately. Not so with the man.				"
4,If I Am Lucky in Life,Home-and-Family,"
					If I am lucky in life, then I must be even luckier in love. According to most couples, marriage is hard work. They always stress how it needs constant attention and maintenance. Perhaps all these hard-working married people are orchids - fragile, temperamental, and require optimal conditions in which to grow. If so, then my husband and I must be weeds. We are hearty, stable, and extremely low maintenance.				"

6,Normal Isn't All It's Cracked Up to Be,Home-and-Family,"
					""Well,"" the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage sighed rather deeply, ""now that the hurricane is over I guess we can all get back to normal."" When she said ""normal,"" she looked at me and gave me one of ""those looks."" I am very much confused when it comes to this idea of normal. What in the world is normal? Often when we go out somewhere she says, ""Please try to act normal tonight."" For me, normal is just the way I act. Furthermore, I am not acting.				"
7,Those Annoying Sounds of Silence,Home-and-Family,"
					It was in the 60s when Simon and Garfunkel recorded their famous song, ""The Sounds of Silence."" I must confess that I do enjoy what I know of as ""The Sounds of Silence."" Nothing is more relaxing than sitting back with a cup of coffee and enjoying the silence as it whistled by. This has become a rather infrequent period for me. I love the silence and I enjoy the peace and quiet it brings. The problem is, silence can be taken too far. Recently, we were the target of a ferocious hurricane who tried to have her way with us. She snorted, huffed, puffed and stomped her way up through the state of Florida. As it turned out, although there was a tremendous amount of damage, it was not as bad as expected. That is something we can thank God for.				"
8,My Sneeze Is No Gentle Breeze,Home-and-Family,"
					It has been days (or has it been years) since I have enjoyed a sneeze free day. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage told me it is simply that time of the year and I should learn to deal with it. ""After all,"" she opined, ""you're not going to die."" That news was not quite encouraging, because it was the hope of dying keeping me alive so far. If my brain was functioning anywhere half-decent, (and I can't remember a time it has) I probably could remember when I felt worse. However, it does not matter how I have felt in the past it is how I'm feeling right now that really matters. I have gone through a million boxes of tissues this past week. I would not mind an occasional sneeze every now and then. For example I could live with a simple ""aah-choo,"" and be done with it. But, oh no, my nose has different ideas about the whole thing.				"
9,My Loving Sister and The Joy She Brought to Our World,Home-and-Family,"
					She was born to be special in the eyes of those she touched. The youngest of four siblings she shared her love with all of us equally. From the time she arrived in our midst with her long black curls and brown eyes there was joy in abundance, even through the worst of times.				"
10,I Didn't Win $750 Million,Home-and-Family,"
					During a recent lottery shindig, everybody was watching to see who was going to win all that money. Even I got all caught up in the excitement and was on the edge of my seat too. ""Why,"" the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage said, ""are you so interested in that lottery?"" ""Well,"" I said as soberly as possible, ""what if I win all that money? Wouldn't that be tremendous?"" Then I flashed a gracious million-dollar smile at her. She just stared at me, rolled her eyes and walked away. As she was walking away, she mumbled something like, ""You gotta pay if you're gonna win."" Oh yeah, I thought to myself. I am sitting in my chair wondering what in the world I would do with all that money if I actually would win it when in reality I am not even playing the lottery. I just got all caught up with the idea of winning money.				"
11,Easing the Transition Into Fall,Home-and-Family,"
					The days are getting shorter, the cicadas are singing and the back to school sale coupons are arriving daily - all signals that the ""lazy"" days of summer are soon coming to an end.  Hopefully the summer has provided opportunity to slow down a bit and break away from the tight schedules during the rest of the year.				"
12,Sights and Sounds of Summer,Home-and-Family,"
					This evening as I was catching up on paperwork I heard an owl hoot and knew it was time for me to take a break. As I walked out the front door and took a short walk toward the place I thought the sound was coming from I was greeted with other sounds of summer.				"

14,Celebration Has Become a Way of Life for Me,Home-and-Family,"
					I have just celebrated my birthday, my wife's birthday and our wedding anniversary. I am not sure how old I am or how long we have been married and I won't even go to my wife's age. I'm old enough to know better. I have long past the idea of candles on my birthday cake representing one candle per year. The fire department will not give us a permit to do that. Someone asked me how long we have been married and without even thinking, I said, ""Forever."" Once that word danced out of my lips I knew I was in trouble with the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. One look from her, and I knew that my forever had ended.				"
15,The Endless Flow of Ink,Home-and-Family,"
					This past week I had my yearly visit with my doctor. Believe me, it was no vacation but it did vacate the cash in my wallet. It was not the loss I needed at the time. It is amazing about my doctor. He knows the exact cash I have in my wallet at any given time. More amazing, everything he does for me is covered by that cash in my wallet. One time I try to hide a five spot in my wallet, but to no avail. The doctor knew it was there, somehow, I'm not sure how. Most doctors are experts in the area of extraction. Mostly, the extraction of cash from their patients. That may be what they learn in medical school, I'm not too sure. My doctor ordered me to come in the next day for a blood test and the nurse came in to prepare me. One thing she said was I needed to fast before coming to the doctor's office the next day.				"
16,A Discount by Any Other Name,Home-and-Family,"
					I find too often I get all caught up with the busyness of life that I forget some things. For example, last week the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I had birthdays. Our birthdays are only two days apart, which is convenient for me. My birthday is first, and if my wife gets me anything for my birthday, it reminds me I need to get something for her birthday two days later. I could not plan it out any better had I tried. We celebrated our birthdays, I know which one I was celebrating but I'm not allowed to mention the one my wife was celebrating. I did that once, but I learned my lesson and I will never, ever do it, ever again. Did I mention ever?				"

18,"As Summers Go, This One Is Going",Home-and-Family,"
					During my high school career I was no thespian, however, I could act the fool when called upon. My friend was the thespian and starred in our senior high school play, ""Finian's Rainbow."" One of the musical numbers was, ""When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near."" I have altered this title a little to fit my own needs. My version goes, ""When I'm not in the season I love, I love the season I'm in."" It is a wonderful motto and has solved quite a few problems down the years. Just don't ask me to sing it for you. I can, but you do not want to hear it... believe me. At my age I have learned a thing or two. One of the things I have learned is that you might as well be content where you are at because that is where you are. All these people that are jumpy and nervous because they are not exactly where they want to be, waste a lot of precious time and energy.				"

					When one is away from someone you love it is strange how you can not even miss them that much. Then you come together again and instantly there is a warmth that only happens in the presence of a dear one. That happened to me recently when visiting my brother whom I had not seen for 2 years.

1,Reluctantly Related: Mom-In-Law V/S Daughter-In-Law,Home-and-Family,"
					We have often come across this layman saying - God sent an angel in the form of a Mother and a devil in the form of a Mother-in-Law... I mean no offense to the latter set of parent however, there are times that this particular saying makes me wonder- why are we unbiased in so many ways to our mom-in-laws... For many of us the reasons are obvious - they are biased towards us, since we are daughter-in-laws. But isn't it vice versa because they are a mom-in-laws!				"
2,The Amazing Wonder of AGE,Home-and-Family,"
					I have just celebrated my recent birthday. By now, it is getting to be old business for me. Just another day of the year to celebrate something, which just happens to be my birthday. I believe that if it is my birthday, I should be able to celebrate whatever birthday I want to celebrate. You are only as old as you celebrate. I am not embarrassed at how old I am, I just sometimes cannot remember the exact figure. Some of my friends are rather legalistic along this line and are demanding the exact number of my birthday. Is it really that important? Does it really matter how old you are?				"

4,"Go Ahead, Call Me If You Dare",Home-and-Family,"
					I don't think it was in the mind of Dr. Bell when he invented the telephone for people like me to be harassed by people who are only after my money. Don't get me wrong here. The telephone has been a great blessing to many people. But lately, the wrong people have my number. It finally came to a head this past week. At least as far as I was concerned. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I had a very busy week and by Thursday we had accomplished a lot, or at least we thought we had. We had lunch with a very good friend and enjoyed ourselves tremendously.				"
5,In Loving Contemplation,Home-and-Family,"
					Today I find myself thinking how blessed I am and that my children are an inexplicable gift from God. I remember a lot of little things about my enchanting daughter, which I am afraid will fade away like sand through my fingers if too much time passes. Haven't you ever loved someone so much that every minute that has passed with them is like a wisp of smoke in the air that you can see but cannot bring back?				"
6,Did I Just Blow My Cover?,Home-and-Family,"
					Life has been rather good to me in many respects. The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I are a wonderful team and have been for so many years; I'm not allowed to say how many. As a team, she can fix anything and I can break anything. That certainly goes hand-in-hand with life. No matter what I can break, she can fix. This has made life rather good. Throughout life, I have gone under the ruse that when it comes to fixing things I am all thumbs and no fingers. I cannot seem to fix anything. Of course, if it can be fixed with a hammer I might try. When anything goes wrong in our house, I offer to fix it and my wife steps in most gallantly and retires me to my easy chair.				"
7,I Was Just Thinking,Home-and-Family,"
					Thinking is not my strong suit by any stretch of the imagination. Every time I start thinking, I either get a headache or get into trouble. I'm not sure which is worse, the headache or the trouble. In my normal pursuit of life, thinking sits in the backseat. If there is an emergency, thinking may come forward and help out. However, in the meantime, thinking is not something I like to do on a regular basis.				"

					Crickets chirping in the weeds, lightning bugs flickering in the nighttime sky and the always present moths gathered around porch lights all combined with whispers, giggles and childish pranks to get attention. This was summer in America, when time slowed and children stared at fluffy clouds imagining what they could become. This was summer before computers or video games; children played ball across the neighbors yards, helped with the lawn and eagerly planned bike trips and visits to the community pool. Front porches were an important part of American history then. It's where parents stood to call the children in, best friends huddled and families shouted greetings from.				"
11,How Much Should You Pay Your Sitter?,Home-and-Family,"
					It used to be so simple. Your mom might have paid the neighbor girl a few dollars to keep an eye on a house full of kids while she and your dad went off for an evening on their own. Of course, some grown kids today might remember being left with a particularly negligent sitter who talked on the phone, munched on everything in the refrigerator and ordered the kids out of her sight.

Have you ever noticed when you lose something, it is always in the last place you look? I could save a lot of time, not to mention energy, if I would look for that lost item in the last place first. Back to the sounds of silence in the parsonage. When the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage awoke from her beauty sleep on Monday morning, she discovered sometime during the night she lost her voice.

The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I have been married since 1971 and have not had a serious argument or disagreement. (She does not allow me to talk back.) We have had rough times, but not with each other. We have survived nine congregations, 19 homes, three children with nine grandchildren and all without compromising our relationship.

I have not been all that successful, but I still try. As I was standing in line I heard the woman behind me say, ""Johnny, you can't have your cake and eat it too."" I did not know the background story because I did not hear the whole conversation. When I heard that my mind took me back to those thrilling days of yesteryear when my parents, both of them addicted to this phrase, said to me, ""You can't have your cake and eat it too."" I cannot remember the reasons that this phrase kept popping up in my parents' conversation. But I never could figure out what in the world they were talking about.				"

8,A Black Eye Causes A Quandary of the First Order,Home-and-Family,"
					I found myself in a quandary recently through no fault of mine. And yet, I'm not able to prove it. This is the most discouraging thing. I know it was not my fault, but nobody will believe me. Through the years, I have adopted a certain nocturnal procedure. When I get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom I keep my eyes closed. There is a very simple reason for this. One, I know exactly where I am going, so I don't need to open my eyes. Two, I do not want my body to know that I'm awake. I want to fool my body into believing I'm asleep. I used to do what everybody else does. Get up, open my eyes and go to the bathroom. However, whenever I did, my body thought I was up for the night and try as I might, I could not convince my body to go back to sleep until I made one trip to the kitchen, and you know what that meant. Exactly... the refrigerator. This kitchen appliance holds no appeal for me, but I do enjoy the contents. Moreover, my body knows this only too well.				"
9,Life Does Have Its Compensations - Occasionally,Home-and-Family,"
					At times, it seems as if there is absolutely no justice in this world, and then something wonderful happens making up for almost everything. This past week I was fortunate enough to experience one of those rare jewels of life. I must say not all weeks are like this. My weeks usually range from bad to worse to when will this ever stop? A normal week for me is when I take two steps forward and get run over by a car. Or, just when I think I'm caught up, I discover I've been working on last week's to-do list. Not that I'm complaining because complaining never gets anywhere in life. At least, no place I want to go. A man who complains aloud is a man who is not married. Wives have a way of turning their husband's complaining into ""Well, its your own fault."" It's amazing how this one phrase can cover a multitude of sins.				"

					Getting old seems to be a long and slow process. The longer it goes the older you get. I didn't really think I was getting old until a few weeks ago I was visiting with some friends from high school. You know those old high school friends that you had fun with when you were young enough to have fun? And oh boy, what fun we had. A sharp difference exists between being young and being old. You have to get old to really understand the difference because when you are young you do not have enough time to think. That's the problem with young people today. So many things to do and so much technology they do not have any time left over to think.				"

					You would think being a husband as long as I have been I would have learned the fine art of negotiating with my wife. And trust me, it is an artistic creation. When I got married, somebody told me that marriage was a 50-50 proposition, which being the na√Øve young man that I was, believed it entirely. The problem I have discovered is that 50 from a man's point of view may not necessarily be 50 from a woman's point of view. If I knew then what I know now, I would have asked that person to define what they meant by 50. Through the years, I discovered that at times it is a 25-75 split. Other times it is a 0-100. Nobody can be 100% right all the time unless of course they are married to a husband.				"

Today, let us throw light on of the most substantial relationships- our grandparents. The reason I would like to discuss this concept: I personally feel that in this competitive and fashionable elite, our relation with grandparents have rotten. The extent to which they are belittled is just outrageous. As a matter of fact even in most affluential families, it has been observed that old parents are treated disrespectfully and rebuffed. They are not considered an important asset of the family. Is it just because we are now well acquainted to live in this virtual world mirrored with materialistic needs?				"

					New Year's Day was filled with lots of excitement, plenty of grandchildren running around and enough food on the table to eliminate world hunger. Actually, it did eliminate my ravishing hunger, at least for the day. Both the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and Yours Truly simultaneously signed a deep sigh. My wife sat in her chair thinking and I, reclining in my chair musing. Believe me, we both had a lot to think about and muse over. The difference between thinking and musing is quite profound. Thinking requires a lot of hard work while musing is closely related to amusing, although I am not quite sure about the connection. All I know is it takes less energy to muse than it does to think and I'm all for saving energy.				"

Thus, when a man assumes the role of a husband and architects his own family, he is mandated by his heavenly authority to steer its affairs.

We never forget the hurts caused by others. We carry the hurts with us, in our minds till death. God wants us to live with lesser unpleasant memories.
