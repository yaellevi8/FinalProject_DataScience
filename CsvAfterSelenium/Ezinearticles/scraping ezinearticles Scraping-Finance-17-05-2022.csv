1,What Good Is the Economy in the Light of the Environmental Destruction It Causes?,Finance,"
					While politicians stand up for the economy and promise more jobs, better services, and so forth the bottom line is they are the ones sanctioning the destruction of the environment.

"
6,Money and Power,Finance,"
					If anyone wants to know why money was invented they need to look at the power that it generates.

"
10,Why Money Depletes Resources,Finance,"
					For hundreds of millions of years deposits within the earth resulted from the death of old forests, the movement of land, and the shifting of oceans.

12,Money Causes Extinction of Species,Finance,"
					A very sad report on Australian television showed the way the Andes is being depleted of forest and how species are dying and a lot is due to illegal loggers.

17,Money and the Spirit of the Universe,Finance,"
					Many give God the name The Universe and that is pretty close to my knowledge of it.

2,Why Money Is Destroying the Planet,Finance,"
					It seems obvious that money is the tool bulldozing everything alive into the ground.
