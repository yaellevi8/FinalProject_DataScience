He still regrets it today. The death and resurrection of Jesus totally and forever disarmed the Devil and the operators of the kingdom of darkness. In fact, they did not believe he would come out of that grave. They used everything to stop him.

					The immovable substrate or foundation of U.S. Constitutional federalism, or the basis for the separation of federal and State powers, is not an ambiguous matter that involves convoluted legal explanations and opinions by long-winded and pompous judicial activist justices on the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), but, rather, a very simple grouping of words comprising the Tenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights. This Amendment clearly states that, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."" Consequently, the powers granted by the Constitution to the federal government are explicitly contained in the original text of the U.S. Constitution. This means that no other federal powers may be added except specifically, and not implicitly, by the amendment process. These basic federal powers are contained in Article 1, Section 8, Article 2, and Article 3 detailing the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial powers. All other powers, matters, and issues are reserved to the States. What exactly comprises these reserved powers, and why are these powers being usurped by the federal government.

					Today, we seem to be experiencing a period of time, when there is more strife, division, and polarization, as we have witnessed, in recent memory, and, perhaps, the larger amount of indviduals, who seem to be, unwilling, to seek any common ground, in order to secure, a far greater chance at reaching, a meeting - of - the - minds, than, this nation has seen, since our Civil War! No doubt, there are several reasons for this, including, economic, racial/ ethnic, etc, but, much of this, may have been, brought - to - a - head, because of the unusual...				"

When, he continues, prioritizing, bringing, large numbers of people together (most of which, not wearing masks, or social spacing), he creates a risk, to the health, and well - being, of many Americans. Since, Trump, already, claimed, this would go away, by itself, when the weather...				"

18,Different Visions Of America: 7 Examples,News-and-Society,"
					Does it seem, to you, as it does to many others, one of the reasons, our nation is so divided, is there are different visions, held, of what, this nation, means (and should mean), and represent, and how we need, to proceed forward, into the future? When Donald Trump proclaims his famous slogan, Make America Great Again, it creates, different emotions, views, and beliefs, in what that means and represents, and whether, it is a good, or bad thing! Today's, America, is, perhaps, the most divided, in recent memory, and attempting to get all or most factions, to work together,...				"

If these statements, were, merely, occasional, it might be considered, the normal, from politicians, but, it seems, no matter how often, obvious, etc, the lies, may be, they keep coming!

In their quest, to get elected, many politicians, never become statesmen, after they are elected, and, seem to pay, more attention to making, often - empty, rhetoric, and promises, using simplistic - populism, rather than considering the bigger- picture, including the potential ramifications, in a relevant, sustainable mind - set!

After, over four decades of involvement, in nearly, all aspects of leadership, from identifying and qualifying, to training, developing, and consulting to thousands of actual, as well as potential leaders, and working on many political campaigns, I have come to believe, being a genuine, real leader, takes a variety of skills, and assets, and not, merely, articulating any self - promoting rhetoric, and empty promises!

How could it be, the opponents, and supporters, of President Donald Trump, have such a significant difference of opinion, about the validity, and truth of so many, of his statements? The recent, Republic National Convention, has clearly demonstrated this, where, the apparent, use of revisionist history, political spin, and what seems to be, outright - lies, has seemed to effectively,...

However, many, who are familiar, with these circumstances, disagree, with his narrative, there is little doubt, this book, largely, contributed to his celebrity - status, especially, when combined with the popularity, and notoriety, he received, from his successful, television, reality show!

					With all the talk about Trump's America, Make America Great Again, and so much more rhetoric, etc, we need to take a step - back, and seriously, consider, Whose AMERICA Is It, Anyway? Many Americans fail to consider, we are still, a somewhat, younger nation, and, less than 250 years old!

Perhaps, more than ever, before, in recent memory, this nation needs public leaders, who are ready, willing, and able, to CREATE, instead of destroying. There is a significant difference, between, making changes, for, change - sake, and seeking/ implementing, quality changes, which might make a difference, for the better!				"

Instead of using it, as one component, it seems, often, Trump uses it, as a major communication tool, and, often, makes proclamations, and statements, using these vehicles!
