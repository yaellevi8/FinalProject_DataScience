13,5 Ways to Extend Your Data Communications Without Limits,Computers-and-Technology,"
					Your network is only as effective as its reach - yet unbalanced signals such as USB and RS-232 can reliably transmit only up to 15 feet, and even balanced Ethernet signals are capped at 300 feet. With a growing range of connectivity platforms, modern data networks require not just compatibility and reliability but also flexibility and expandability. There are many ideal solutions to meet modern networks' data distance needs such as converting unbalanced signals to balanced ones, deploying repeaters to boost signal strength, and implementing hubs for star-configured connections, while still taking full advantage of cost-effective and readily available copper wire. For large systems that go far beyond what copper wires can reach, fibre-optic converters can used to work in both conventional point-to-point and advanced daisy-chain / redundant-ring configurations, giving your data network a boost in distance, ranging from 3 miles to hundreds of miles, and additional flexibility, reliability, and expandability. The use of a Serial-TCP program is another ideal solution for merging serial communication protocols with modern TCP/IP communication, yielding benefits such as widely available infrastructures and greater distance, reliability, and speed.				"
14,Protect Your Assets With Optical Isolators and Surge Protectors,Computers-and-Technology,"
					The world of data communication is busy, even noisy. Industrial communication systems, such as balanced RS-485 / RS-422, often require transmission between multiple devices over long distances. While having many devices communicating with each other on the same twisted-pair cable is robust and cost-effective, it also introduces two major challenges: 1) because of the long distances and the surrounding electrical devices/equipment, RS-485 / RS-422 networks are often exposed to electrical noises, remote lightning, and line surges, which can cause transient voltage to run across the serial communication system and the valuable equipment; 2) because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through ""the path of least resistance"" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. Both voltage and current surges can cause serious damage to valuable, mission-critical equipment such as computers, PLCs, and industrial manufacturing and data processing equipment; these surges can even endanger human lives. Ground loop problems also exist on unbalanced signals that rely on the ground pin being zero volts, such as RS-232 and USB. Optical Isolators and Surge Protectors are the solutions to these problems.				"
15,4 Types of Connectivity With Industrial Ruggedness,Computers-and-Technology,"
					Connectivity is crucial for all types of data networks.

Moreover, many different types of data formats, standards, media and connectors are often mixed and used together within a single data network. Examples of different types of standards and protocols include physical-layer standards, such as RS-232, RS-485, RS-422, TTL, USB, and TCP/IP, and higher-level protocols, such as Profibus, Interbus, Modbus, BACnet, and Modbus TCP/IP. Copper wires and optical fibers are typical examples of different media; and there are dozens of different connectors used for machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity and data communication systems, including DB9, DB25, USB type A, USB type B, mini USB, micro USB, terminal blocks, RJ11, RJ45, and ST, SC, FC, and LC connectors for fiber optic products. There are 4 different types of connectivity namely: Serial, USB, Ethernet and Fiber Optic.				"
