0,Op Amp Specifications,Communications,"
					Common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR):The input to a difference amplifier, in general, contains two components: a common-mode and a difference-mode signal. The common-mode signal voltage is the average of the two inputs, whereas the difference- mode signal is the difference between the two inputs. Ideally, an amplifier affects the difference-mode signals only. However, the common-mode signal is also amplified to some degree. The common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), which is defined as the ratio of the difference signal voltage gain to the common-mode signal voltage gain provides an indication of how well an op amp does at rejecting a signal applied simultaneously to both inputs				"

					Since a transmission line has impedance built in, the natural question to ask is, how does the impedance affect signals that are relayed through a transmission line from one device to another? The answer to this question ultimately depends on the impedance of the devices to which the transmission line is attached. If the impedance of the transmission line is not the same as the impedance of, say, a load connected to it, the signals propagating through the line will only be partially absorbed by the load. The rest of the signal will be reflected back in the direction it came. Reflected signals are generally bad things in electronics.				"

However, unlike JFETS, MOSFETs have larger gate lead input impedances (e1014 ©, as compared with 109 © for JFETs), which means that they draw almost no gate current whatsoever. This increased input impedance is made possible by placing a metal oxide insulator between the gate-drain/source channel. There is a price to pay for this increased amount of input impedance				"

The dual redundant PLC system reduces the chance of an ESD system shutting down the plant because of ESD equipment failure. However, it ensures the plant is shut-down when there is a failure in the plant.				"
