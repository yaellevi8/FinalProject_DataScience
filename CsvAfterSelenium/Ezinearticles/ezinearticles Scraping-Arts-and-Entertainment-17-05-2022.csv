15,The Universe in Motion Parts IV Through VI,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					Underneath the Universe she palpates as if with sanguine ardor, as if she drinks the magic of the gods. She hisses and expands: loud she bursts, and piercing she is. She ripples with molting heat, and coiled verminous translucent light: flowing eyes, fair and fertile. She belongs to a jealous owner, who resents no intrusion, lest it should come with evil intent! And deeming themselves secure from his observations, bear in mind He is her creator, as well as theirs! The Universe is elastic, a living thing, always moving her substance always in motion: filled with orbiting globes, nebulas glow, - drooped like branches, and looped like horseshoes. She wears a threadbare tunic of matter, antimatter, atoms. She devours suns, broken easily under her teeth, swollen, suffocated to a strange fever, tossed into a black hole, wider than earth's solar system, then passes them quickly in her belly-				"

17,The Hyperborean Mythos The Irony of the Taxidermist (And the Lilith and the Birdman),Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					Lilith: she-devil! To understand the story you are about to read, which in essence, is the small part of this sketch or prelude, you must understand the background; thus, be patient with this writer, and we'll get to the gory stuff momentarily. (January 8, 57 A.D.) With the breath of perdition-Lilith, gaunt winged and with a cragged back, and austere frothing from her lips, beheld her doom, her veils of foaming fury, ere, to be scant, from this day on, she was lashed with ropes, senseless she lay where the archangel put her, as she dimly was heard shrilling as of an unknown bird, as the folk of London looked on, as did the Roman soldiers, intently, as well as the children that stood by, witnessed in merriment in the aspect of the she-devil whose garments were draggled and stiff and stained with dry mud, and blood, from the fight, became restrained.				"
18,The Anonymous Asmodeus ((Old Testament Demon) (Poetic Prose)),Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					You don't hear of him much nowadays, but he's around, been around for a very long time, the ancient demon, Asmodeus, a baneful creature, from a mummy-like abyss. And this is a story of his nature, awareness, and of his presence. As in some pestilential mist, he sluggishly clogs his way, likened through a muddy riverbed in dreams in the circuit of the mind, like a fair and baneful succubi, trying to rape men, beasts or maidens, producing a nightmare, while sitting on their chests, in the midst of a midnight moon. And like a thief in the night, Asmodeus did slip into my dreams last night, this hell-born demonic beast, as if into a cell and its nucleus, ere. Why? Perhaps he was unable to calm his agitation with me, that I discovered him out, early on that afternoon, the one so many have in the past had to use exorcism to beguile him to abandon his home away from home! Perchance, I offended him, and this was his frightful penance, demons can be counter punchers, as well as instigators; they tend to have a ghoulish hunger, and incubus-like desires.				"
19,Worlds Beyond Lair of the Venusian Worm (In Three Parts),Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					It was well known Dr. Marge Johnson of the Louisiana Space Station, one of the leading and foremost and youthful scientists, possessed amid her far-stretching theories of Mars, and life on Venus (and perhaps both places being resting charnel, a place of once great sufferings, and now a lone graveyard of bones, in essence, two world sarcophaguses). For Ms. Johnson, a much kept secret from all her men and women envious scientists; for her more than theories, part from being a magician she could-so she felt- prove, her hypotheses. It was plain in 2034 A.D., she would be the first woman on Mars, and thereafter Venus, if the edifice went according to plan. She had ascertained regarding Mars' interior, things as it required ((Quantum Elucidations) (brainstorming in essence)) given only by wizards of long ago legends, who spoke in riddles and rhyme, that none at the Space Station could interpret, or if they could, were too farfetched to ponder on. But her ardor for the unknown and owlish irony of it, superseded all their mown.				"

0,Before Light (Or: 'Terrestrial Darkness'),Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					In the time of torrential darkness, when the night was older than the sun-or so it gave the impression, for eons, within earth's solar system, a period between space and time, that can't be accounted for but was, when the earth brooded for the sun, and the moon had a miasma noxious influence, an anomalous night light creeping through the deep atmospheric cloud of earth, trying to penetrate its eldritch darkness, yawning to shed a tinge of graceful light upon earth, being but a few rays at its brightest moment and sharing but a tenth of that, at midnight was the earth's nocturnal age. During the closing of this period, earth`s demonic race was awaiting its one time ruler, Lucifer; but the heavenly battle was so harsh it disrupted the whole solar system; thus, came the nocturnal ages, one passing onto another. And therefore, little to nil, life in all forms had to barely survive the long night, which goes for earth's foliage, and sea life, to include, among the left over legitimate parts of humanity or subhuman humanity, life that had survived in the leagues of blackness, they survived deep in the deep ebon hollows				"
1,Artistic Decisions and the Flow of Energy,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					With an openness of mind that doesn't attempt to regulate the flow of artistic energy, it becomes easier to assess all the factors which must be considered for addition to or removal from any one of our works. A mindset that doesn't take into account the critical opinions of others finds that it is much smoother to sift through the elements of a piece so that they coalesce naturally into the artistic structure we were seeking. The more the decision-making process takes on the characteristic of a smooth flowing stream of artistic expression unregulated by social conventions, the doubt and fear will dissipate and the power of choice will operate naturally and with ease.				"
2,Intensity of Emotion in Art,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					The intensity of emotion is best expressed by using the dynamic methods of an art form. Every creative subject has its own formalized approaches for the use of dynamics, but in general dynamics are tools we can use as options for increasing or decreasing the amount of emotion flowing between artist and audience. The proper use of dynamics is as a diagnostic tool for testing, measuring, and adjusting the intensity of emotion in an art form. A gradual change or a sudden impact basically comprise all types of dynamic categories, but it's the combination, structure and timing of each of these elements that alter the distribution of emotional intensity in creative work. By pushing some dynamic factors to extremes and reducing others to levels where you'd hardly notice their presence, you begin to get a feel for how each factor will interact with every other factor in your art work.				"
3,Emotional Time and Space Grid,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					Art expressed with a narrow range of dynamic components translates into emotions expressed within a narrow band of feeling. To expand feeling one has to expand the range of dynamic elements to approach the analogue quality of human emotions. Once the force of an artwork has captured the attention of the mind it is brought to the emotional time and space grid. Attention begins to pool and collect in that area of the mind and reverberates. Attention pours into that point of disturbance and rises into a stretched wave, suspended across time, as the mind continues receiving a constant stream of stimuli. The wave rises and falls as the signal increases and decreases in intensity or volume. Art brings creative work to this point when the convergence of factors impacts the mind with sufficient force to call forth or evoke a particular emotion or emotional experience.				"

This wave energetic as it was, picked up sediments, to include massive boulders, and dumped them at high and low elevations, and cut new channels into the orbs surface, and caved in many of Mars' underground channels and passages. The areas known as Chryse Planitia and Arabia Terra, were badly hit, regions of Mars. And ever since, these new and some old passages, and dome like cavers have been home to the Mar-demon.				"

					When Dr. McGee left my office to investigate a matter concerning Venus and Saturn, along with its moons, he left with me his memorandums on his research up to date on the issue he was putting together. Somehow I was not optimistic I'd not see him again in the flesh. I had no doubts he-as always-had discovered something, after he had denoted something about hand-axes made of flint 700,000-years ago found on a Norfolk beach, a recent axe made of basalt 49,000 years old, then referring to the first Sumerian King, A-lu-lim, 241,000 B.C., and the north and south poles being reversed by earth's magnetic invisible shield which seemingly took place 778,000-years ago, he called it: 'Planet Reversal' and then he went home, sat in chair, had heart attack and died. My old Army friend, and scientific comrade, just like that. The funeral took place in Alabama yesterday, and his manuscript, or memos he left behind for me to ponder on, a step into the mysterious cloud-enwrapped planet earth, as it was perhaps known to humanity or its inhabitants, per near a million years ago, information unattainable had he not left them with me.				"
11,Worlds Beyond The Waldorf Catacomb,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					The two planets circle a small sun, a dwarf sun, as often the term is used for planets of a small size planets, but in this case, these two planets are the size of earth, and the sun is small, so we can call it, a dwarf sun, that is, its size is 1/8 the size of earth's sun, so the analogy fits I do believe. This solar system, from these two planets and sun, is forty light-years from earth, small as it is it is seeable from earth's telescope and by Hubble's Space Telescope, in interstellar space, without a problem. William H. Waldorf is a psychbiologist, with a secondary doctorate in psychodynamics. Scientists know man will never get to physically walk on any of those two planets, but they are of interest to them: it would take 80-years roundtrip, at the speed of light. Dr. Waldorf, stationed in Darmstadt Germany, as a consultant for the Space Station there, has been working on a special project, a system that will change time-travel, that is to say, faster than the speed of light, where scraps and fragments of a person, through mind projection will be patched together, as a shadow...

					Dr. Nutt. I fell into a sky that now had grown dark, the whole scene took on a semi-nocturnal aspect, and made me think of doom, in the twilight of a dying sun. It was as if I was on the airless moon in silence. I heard not even a leave or an insect move, uncanny silence. It was the silence of the endless emptiness. Death nearly confirmed by disquietude. Now I heard a sound in the silence of this macabre scene, like a click, the swing of a pendulum. I turned to listen closer, what reality was I now to confront?... No sooner had the movement of the pendulum made another click I felt warmth. I was petrified, I felt I was weighted down by some unavoidable nightmare. But I felt motion, and heat emerged from this motion, even from its shadow motion came as if one thing triggered another, and heat thereafter, for the moon was at first cold - figuratively speaking for I don't know if I was or if I wasn't on the moon mentally, spiritually in some time and space box, and that's where I felt I was.

					All that he learned, Pachacuti E, and saw and did was never told, or written down, but he did leave a journal of sorts for me, moreover, a brief written account, more like a letter, in his Peruvian native tongue -Quechua-... and now I understand why E did not write down everything. He viewed unfailingly, repulsion he had no words for; on the other hand, it became of a morbid interest in the 'seeds of time.' To my understanding much he reframed from witnessing, doing, consuming. And many of the times he wished he had a Rosary, although not Catholic, and I'm unsure even if he was a Christian or of any certain faith, he just mentioned it in passing, but as he also told me, 'What is done is done,' it sounds like a quote from Macbeth, and he wrote me, Dr. D.L. Siluk, 'I fear, Ayre, by this, this day's end you shall see me no more, nor shall I set sight, again of the sun? Long ago, I had found the padlock to hell's door? To its eldritch passages.

7,The Hyperborean Mythos - The Abomination of the Tor,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					The old man was of an inordinate age - He left a mound-lore (of the Tor) Perhaps mostly of fragile gossip, yet it was food for thought. ""It is the only hillock around Summerset, and considered quite old... A manmade structure, once known as Avalon, which had a moat of water surrounding it... !"" My start was timid- I carried a handbag, field glasses, a steel pistol, strong rope, incidentals for emergencies, and a trench-knife, along with a heavy battery-operated flashlight- To those who knew me, I was set out for a certain doom. At one time, the mound, or Tor-during the 10th Century A.D., was known for its expression of infinite evil. Although I could not concur with this. At present there was a slight decadence to the ancient long-rounded- mound, with striking features, as I did my surveying and orbiting by foot to its perimeter- Hence, convincing me it was an artificial tumulus (perchance dating as far back to the days of the Neanderthal, if not proto-Neanderthal, or some intergalactic alien burial grounds, like Stone Heap of the Wildcat, in the Golan Heights of Israel).

12,The Theory of Space and Time,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					Since I write some in the area of Science Fiction, I figured I'd write an essay on 'Space and Time', old stuff for the most part. First of all let me explain ""Relativity"" which simply means theory, as does ""Quantum Theories"" so when I say the Theory Relativity I'm really saying, a theory is physics, Quantum meaning, nearly the same thing but beyond the normal gage of known physics, like Black Holes and Gravitational Waves, and so forth. But the Theory of Relativity is the older way of announcing Simple or Special Relativity, by Einstein. Whereas, Quantum Theories would seem to go to Stephen Hawkins. What does all this mean? The Theory of Relativity deals with space and time. Put another way, space can bend and time can be stretched. Quantum theory, is rather unsettling, it has more of a strangeness. For instance, if a star dies, if it gets close to the rim of a black hole, the gravity around the rim will pull it into the hole, and forever be part of that black hole, and never see the light of day again, yet on another note, the black hole may explode and create a new galaxy...

13,Legend of the: The Mound and the Old People (A Minnesota Tale) The Hyperborean Mythos,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					I had gone into Minnesota to track down and correlate one of the ghost stories that still lingered on with the population along the Mississippi, from its upper most wooded parts down and around the bend and mound area of Pigs Eye, as it was referred to in the 1820s and thereafter, and cliffs of St. Paul, and Minneapolis. Mark Twain, had once visited St. Paul, and called it quite the hidden secret. I was searching for its lost lore, I could now vouch for that, for it had a strong and old Indian validation of lost legends. I now prefer to them, in particular one, as open-air ghost stories, or tales, told by old white folks back in the early 1960s, of those earlier years of the 1880s, which sounded flat. Indian mythology should be told by Native Americans, all woven around those vast, lonely looking mounds, resting quietly along the rim of the cliffs. When told by the Indians I could hear the hooves and the feet and the thud and the blows, the muffled cries of warriors. The Chippewa, or Ojibwa, the Cayuga, the old people.				"

He had left his wife and two young boys to go shopping, she took the small Chevy truck they owned, as he took his late afternoon walk around the neighborhood, and around Cherry Park, where his house paralleled the park that paralleled the Church. It was close to the time he figured she'd be back and so he was on his way back to the house.				"
15,The Hyperborean Mythos - The Great Astronomical Conspiracy,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					At the precise instant all one-hundred great spacecrafts consolidated into a confederacy, left their planet, details of the disaster still were lurking in the background, a great terrific disturbance was about to take place, and blot out the planet's atmosphere, it was to the several species of the planet the gravest alarm its star-sun was about to explode, from within, it had lost its gravitational hold, its mass exploded, and this caused gravity to distort, and all the planets within that solar system to drift into intergalactic space, and like the dead sun, as it got closer to the galaxy's black hole, the gravity around the rim of the hole swallowed up the sun and the planets it dragged with it! For the space travelers, the end was near long ago, and it was too late to wait any longer. This caused a ripple in time and space, a gravitational wave that would sweep its way across the universe.				"
16,Testimony to the Moon,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					Incited to reminiscence, on my patio roof I sat as often I do in the late hours of the night: walls but no windows, a mounting wind rattled coming from the Pacific Ocean a few miles away, talking to Elohim, and his son Jesus, Lord of Hosts. I kept on recalling my younger days, while thinking of the moon, as if it was my neighbor, I appeared not to have no chance to grow drowsy, but drifted off from the three subjects: talking, dreaming and the searching for the moon. Had I not had a nightlight on the patio, and a streetlight alongside my house, it would have been pitch-darkness. My house large as it is has a manorial dignity to it, hard to light up the spacious roof patio at best. To many of my neighbors I am just an emaciated old man, poet of sort, hence a tinge eccentric for my ways. There was something provocatively fascinating about this night. The sky looked of the graces and spaciousness of a bygone era. The clouds looked like great ionic pillars reaching into a flying cross, with wings, and a fishtail on the end-back:				"

He had or gave the appearance he did get bored with her, and she was a faithful wife so he had learned, 'But I bet that he never really, and truly never loved her. So what?' Thought the psychologist, talking to himself. 'He had made his life out of complications and drama, and boredom, yet filled his human commitments, so he did not hurry for the funerals, that's the answer.' The psychologist feared to say this out loud lest he give him an excuse to deny it. He did admit to the psychologist, on his wedding day he was simply less bored. Now with the deaths, the return of silence and the evening's mildness had come back, that he had before his marriage, this too he admitted was a plus. This was the way Nippon thought. He knew he was hardhearted, not usable by God, as he proclaimed, for God demands an open heart, but more often than not, openhearted people were in a class of their own, in a governing...				"
18,Nippon's Truck Confession,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					Nippon got thinking of his life-indulging in his calculated confession with his conscience and subconscious, crisscrossing with those alternate voices, -sitting still in that truck for hours, - he deliberated on his esteem, his liberation, his immunity to judgment, or to be judged. In many ways life held a silence, a deafening, an ache he told himself, feeling as if he lived in a primeval woods not a modern day city, with heavy threats, and pigheadedness in the hearts of many, if not snobbery, as he presupposed the Cro-Magnon man might have felt had he had time to visit Lima, in his space and time for a month or year or decade: surely he'd feel lodged in, as in the iron works of the Eiffel Tower, unable to free himself. But he had to live among what he called, 'The antes' the human ants, but never having understood them, life in the big city was moldy to him.				"
19,Nippon Eldritch Vigil,Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					Nippon had told himself, he was different than the run of mill people, and actually he said there were 3% of people like him in the world, that simply were different, and perhaps to other people, a little stranger, for people called it absurdness, or indifference when in essence it was perhaps all that, yet those like him were, people with no impedimenta, no provisions, necessities, no baggage to carry around, or such to ricochet back to them, that he lived in a world of adumbration, one with a sketchy outline yes, a foreshadow yes, but what can one do, what one is like, is hard to change! So he had asked himself time and again, and he figured it out after long study into several ologies, and figured there was two links to Homo sapiens, it's the way God was testing the madness of man: the first being the Neanderthals, they diverged from a common ancestor in what scientists claimed there was a gap in the anthropological record, and that was the Homo heidelbergensis.

17,The Trials and Ordeals of a Cornered Pope ((Pius XII) (An Essay/Theme)),Arts-and-Entertainment,"
					Pope Pius XII is an interesting subject, especially during his papacy, during WWII. His actions can be viewed as having potentially multiple meanings. We even have to step into the phenomenal, or unbelievable consciousness of the pope, and the human condition of the times. His life during this brief time can be viewed metaphorical, as he resists the Nazi occupation in his own way, not the way we might have done it but his way. At one point he sees, ultimately sees, he has no control, and death, perhaps irrational for the observer outside the walls of the Vatican, irrational, but for the living under the Nazi regime, inevitable. Italy and Germany were in a like manner, stepbrothers, figuratively speaking (and the Vatican was at the edge of their horizon): For Pope Pius XII, the philosophical of the absurd was taking place. He sees a regime who can and will, and is killing at will, indifferently killing the whole of humanity that gets in its way, although there are exceptions, but few. The Jew per near a complete genocide, the Catholics took their share of hardships also, respectively, murder was the name of the game, or sentenced to prison, condemned...				"

					I am caught in-between a trans-dimensional vortex, carried by a gravitational wave ((GW) (as if inside the wave's pocket)), inside a semicircular vessel, caught in the pull of the wave at the speed of light. I will never age at this speed, and now the wave just passed Earth, I fear I shall be on my way to the end of the universe, what end is anyone's guess. Who's to say, perchance this was the very wave that created the Big Bang, after matter and antimatter collided, making it 14.5 billion years old. Or perhaps it is some wave that was created a billion years ago from some supernova, or two black holes with their horrid gravitational pull, plunging into one another, and creating a giant blast. But here I am all the same. It would seem I was asleep a long while, perhaps this vessel was pulled off its course, on my way to Earth from Mars, like snatching a hitchhiker off a highway, at full speed; thus my vessel adjoined with the GW, in what one might refer to as transcendental, or awe-inspiring space.

I fed the boys a ham and cheese sandwich, they were per near four years old. Then I put them to bed, ""What can I do until I'm tired?"" I asked myself; a rhetorical question perhaps.

It has traveled throughout the universe from those galaxies, unimpeded through the universe, and has caused an asteroid to wobble off its course, the size being 0.6 - miles wide and it has hit ground in the Gobi Desert, had it been a six mile wide asteroid, the size of the one that wiped out all the dinosaurs eons ago, well it would be a different story-McGee has inferred to his audience: he has told the radio audience as well as television...
