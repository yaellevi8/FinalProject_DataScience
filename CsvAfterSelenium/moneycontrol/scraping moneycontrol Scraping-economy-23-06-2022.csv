0,India's Russian oil imports jump 50 times; now accounts for 10% of all import: official,economy," India's crude oil imports from Russia have jumped over 50 times since April and now make up for 10 per cent of all crude bought from overseas, a senior government official said on Thursday. Russian oil made up for just 0.2 per cent of all oil imported by India prior to the Ukraine war. ""Russia oil now makes up 10 per cent of India's oil import basket in April. It is now among the top 10 suppliers,"" the official told reporters here. As much as 40 per cent of the Russian oil has been bought by private refiners – Reliance Industries and Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy. Last month, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia to become India's second-biggest supplier of oil behind Iraq as refiners snapped up Russian crude available at a deep discount following the war in Ukraine. Indian refiners bought about 25 million barrels of Russian oil in May. Russian-origin crude accounted for 10 per cent of India's total seaborne imports in April for the first time, rising from 0.2 per cent throughout 2021 and Q1 2022. India, the world's third-biggest oil-importing and consuming nation, has long defended purchases of crude oil from Russia following President Vladimir Putin ordering the invasion of Ukraine. The Oil Ministry had last month stated that ""energy purchases from Russia remain minuscule in comparison to India's total consumption."" Iraq remained the top supplier to India in May and Saudi Arabia is now the third biggest supplier. India has taken advantage of discounted prices to ramp up oil imports from Russia at a time when global energy prices have been rising. After the US and China, India is the world's third-largest consumer of oil, over 85 per cent of which is imported. Following its invasion of Ukraine, there are now fewer buyers for Russia's Ural crude oil, with some foreign governments and companies deciding to shun Russian energy exports, and its price has fallen. Indian refiners have taken advantage of this and bought Russian crude oil at discount as high as USD 30 per barrel. Earlier, the crude was disadvantageous because of the high freight cost."
1,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Financial innovation: RBI walks a tight rope,economy," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. What’s fintech? It’s subprime lending on an app — that’s American investment manager Jim Chanos, who perhaps made the remark not entirely in jest. Financial innovation is under fire, in India and other parts of the world as well. Locally, fintech companies are scrambling to make sense of a Reserve Bank of India circular that said loading credit lines into prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) such as wallets and prepaid cards is not permitted. Now PPIs can be loaded with cash, a debit from your bank account, a debit card and even a credit card. On the face of it, one is tempted to ask what’s the big deal – if you can load a PPI using a credit card, why not a credit line provided by a regulated lender? But it seems that the regulator is worried about financial stability and unregulated lending. In a regular credit card, KYC (know your customer) norms are handled by the card issuing bank. In the new business models, KYC is done by the fintech company while the credit line is provided by a bank, or more often, by a non-bank finance company. There is some confusion since the RBI circular said the norms applied to non-bank PPIs. However, there are cases, where a bank-issued PPI (eg. Slice card) are backed by a credit line from an NBFC. RBI, of course, is not comfortable with NBFCs getting into the credit card business. Nor does it seem to have much confidence in the underwriting models employed by fintech companies. Moreover, there are also murmurs that some of the fintechs which are lending aggressively do not report transactions to credit bureaus, all of which can lead to instability building in the system without anyone realising it. If that is the case, the whole Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) gig would become a case for scrutiny. It is one of the fastest growing sectors in the fintech industry. Credit is also seen as a key avenue for profitability among fintech companies since very few make money from payments. While these are early days yet, data from TransUnion Cibil show that BNPL users have higher delinquency rates on credit products compared to users of other forms of unsecured credit such as personal loans, consumer durable loans and so on. The regulator has to walk a tight rope. On one hand, it doesn’t want to stifle innovation. Quite often, products such as BNPL bring new customers into the formal financial system and help them set up a credit history. As Kotak Institutional Equities points out, such innovation then helps banks build scale where they let off, since they have access to low cost funds. The brokerage cites the examples of housing finance to self-employed, commercial vehicle finance and so on, where traditional NBFCs offered new products before banks built scale. On the other hand, there is the question of financial instability, something which no regulator can take lightly. It is not an easy task and Governor Shaktikanta Das said as much in a recent speech: “Large scale use of new methodologies in credit risk assessment can create systemic concerns like over-leverage, inadequate credit assessment, etc. Authorities and regulators have to strike a fine balance between enabling innovation and preventing systemic risks.” In the same speech, the governor also talked about decentralised finance (DeFi) and the unique challenges it posed to regulators. Perhaps, he need not worry so much, at least on this count. The goal of DeFi is to get rid of third parties involved in financial transactions and do away with a centralised governance body. The cryptocurrency crash has exposed the hollowness of such claims as several “Crypto networks that pledged to put users in control have put themselves in charge”, says this article from the FT.

2,Indian economy to grow by 7-7.8% in FY23 despite global headwinds: Experts,economy," The Indian economy can grow by 7-7.8 per cent this fiscal on the back of better agriculture production and a revitalised rural economy amid global headwinds mainly due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, eminent economists said. Eminent economist and BR Ambedkar School of Economics (BASE) Vice-Chancellor NR Bhanumurthy said at present Indian economy is facing multiple headwinds largely from external sources. Noting that global inflationary pressures and the Russia-Ukraine war have brought in risks to the economy, which is otherwise strong with all the domestic macro fundamentals being well managed, he said unlike advanced economies, India's Covid stimulus measures, especially the fiscal policy interventions, are less inflationary and rather growth-enhancing. ""With better agricultural production and revitalised rural economy India should touch 7 per cent growth in the current year despite global headwinds,"" Bhanumurthy told PTI. Echoing similar views, eminent economist and Institute for Studies in Industrial Development (ISID) director Nagesh Kumar said the high-frequency indicators point to a robust growth momentum carrying through 2022-23 with a real GDP growth somewhere between 7-7.8 per cent. French economist Guy Sorman said India could be severely impacted by the high cost of energy and fertiliser imports. ""However, because India is still, largely an agricultural economy, the social impact of slower growth will be tempered by city workers going back to their village. ""This could increase agricultural production and grain exports,"" Sorman added. The World Bank has cut India's economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.5 per cent as rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical tensions taper recovery. India's economy grew 8.7 per cent in the last fiscal (2021-22) against a 6.6 per cent contraction in the previous year. In its third monetary policy of 2022-23, the Reserve Bank retained its GDP growth forecast at 7.2 per cent for the current fiscal, but cautioned against negative spillovers of geopolitical tensions and a slowdown in the global economy. On high inflation, Bhanumurthy said, CPI inflation peaked in March 2022 and a large part of the CPI inflation in the last three months is driven by fuel prices. ""Delayed transmission of domestic fuel prices and rise in global fuel and other commodity prices appears to have led to a sudden spurt in CPI inflation,"" he said, adding that recent policy measures, such as reduction in fuel taxes and hike in policy interest rates, should smoothen inflation and inflation expectations in the coming quarters. Kumar noted that the global headwinds of rising commodity prices do pose downside risks for the Indian economic outlook as the CPI levels are elevated. ""Yet, I do not think that India is heading towards stagflation, given that the growth momentum seems quite robust,"" Kumar argued. According to Sorman, inflation has become a global phenomenon, caused by unanimous poor money management, an excess of public expenses (largely justified to compensate for Covid-19), and low-interest rates. ""The monetary bubble is exploding everywhere. India is not different,"" he pointed out. Retail inflation eased to 7.04 per cent in May, mainly on account of softening food and fuel prices as the government and the RBI stepped in to control spiralling price rise by way of duty cuts and repo rate hikes. However, the inflation print stayed above the Reserve Bank's upper tolerance level of 6 per cent for the fifth month in a row. Asked whether India's economy is in a better place than eight years ago, Sorman said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was selected to fight public corruption and stimulate the Indian economy. ""Modi has, partially, of course, fulfilled his agenda. Most Indians are better off today than they were eight years ago,"" he said."
3,India reports 13.5% rise in engineering exports at $9.79 billion in May 2022,economy," India reported engineering exports at $9.79 billion in May 2022, recording a growth of 13.5 percent over the $8.62 billion reported in the same month a year ago, while the country saw its cumulative engineering exports growing by 16.84 percent at $19.39billion ($16.6 billion) during April-May 2022 period. Though exports to China declined by 52 percent to $217.4 million in May, down from $451.7 million in the same month a year ago, India saw its engineering exports to the United States surging 63.2 percent at $1.81 billion in May, up from $1.11 billion a year ago. Germany, Singapore, the UK, Italy, and Thailand were among the countries that recorded positive growth in the import of engineering goods from India during May. The top 25 countries contributed nearly 75 percent of total engineering exports from India. North America and the European Union were the regions that reported maximum growth in exports from India in both monthly and cumulative terms, according to the data released by the Engineering Exports Promotion Council (EEPC) of India on June 23. Engineering exports accounted for 25.14 percent of total merchandise exports of India in April-May 2022, up from 24.64 percent reported in the same period a year ago. Though India saw its engineering exports growing so far in the current fiscal, concerns still remain, said Mahesh Desai, chairman of EEPC India. “One of the biggest concerns is the Russia-Ukraine war that has severely hampered shipments to CIS nations and may have a ripple effect on the global economy.” Further, Desai viewed that the resurgence of COVID-19 and subsequent damage to business prospects in some industrial cities may also adversely impact the global trade scenario. “Rising oil and commodity prices have added to the uncertainty. A sharp depreciation of rupee, although can help exports, for the time being, continuous weakening may be damaging for the economy,” said Desai, adding that the signing of new free trade agreements with UAE and Australia and ongoing negotiations with a number of developed nations may help exports from India to rise. As per the data of EEPC India, 28 out of 34 engineering panels witnessed positive year-on-year growth in exports during April-May 2022 over the same period a year ago. In May 2022, the exports of iron and steel and its products saw a 16 percent growth to $2.63 billion, up from $ 2.26 billion a year ago. Exports of non-ferrous metals and products rose 21 percent year-on-year to $1.31 billion, while exports of industrial machinery jumped 33 percent to $ 1.58 billion ($ 1.19 billion) in May 2022."
4,"MPC members can start with near-term interest rate forecasts, says Jayanth Varma",economy," Jayanth Varma, one of the three external members of the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has said the rate-setting panel's members should start taking the first steps to providing interest rates projections by initially giving their individual views on where they see the policy rate in the near-term. ""I believe it is possible to start with baby steps and proceed gradually towards the desired goal,"" Varma told Moneycontrol via e-mail. ""It is possible to start with projections only for the next quarter and slowly expand the horizon. It is possible to begin with broad ranges for the policy rate and then progressively refine the range. These are all matters of implementation detail. The important thing is to have a consensus on whether this is worth doing."" Varma's comments come after he was cited as saying in the minutes of the June 6-8 meeting, released on June 22, that the time was ""ripe"" for the committee's members to start moving towards providing projections of the future path of the policy rate. This, according to the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad professor, would help in stabilising long-term bond markets and anchor inflation expectations. The MPC increased the repo rate by 40 basis points in an unscheduled meeting on May 4 and by 50 basis points on June 8, leading to speculation over how many rate hikes will be announced to curb inflation. Economists expect the repo rate to be anywhere between 5.5 percent and 6 percent by the end of FY23. India's headline retail inflation rate was 7.04 percent in May, according to data released earlier this month. The rate has exceeded the medium-term target of 4 percent for 32 consecutive months. It was also the fifth month in a row that inflation was higher than the 6 percent upper limit of the 2-6 percent inflation mandate of the RBI. The central bank's latest forecasts suggest it will fail to meet its inflation mandate later this year. Fed's forecasts The most famous set of interest rate forecasts comes from the US Federal Reserve. These projections, popularly called the dot plot, detail the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' – voting and non-voting – assessment of the appropriate mid-point of the federal funds rate target range at the end of the current and upcoming couple of calendar years as well as in the longer run. The latest projections, released on June 15, showed the median forecast of FOMC members was that the federal funds rate target range would be 3.25-3.50 percent by the end of 2022. In March, the forecast was 1.75-2.00 percent. The US Federal Reserve's dot plot is a key monetary policy guide for financial markets, who often alter their expectations of future interest rate action after seeing changes in the dot plot. While the US central bank publishes these interest rate forecasts – along with those for GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation, and core inflation – four times a year, the RBI publishes only an inflation and growth forecast six times a year. However, the RBI's inflation forecasts have come under fire over the years – initially for being overestimates and more recently, underestimates. According to Abhiman Das, now a professor at Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad after spending over 20 years in the RBI's statistics department working closely on its inflation forecasts, the lack of independent examination of the central bank's analysis by the MPC's external members is a big worry. ""The external members right now come and sit at the RBI for two-three days,"" Abhiman Das told Moneycontrol last month. ""Whatever the RBI staff come and tell them becomes the projection. But who says that projection is right?"" According to Varma, ""a lot of preparation and hard work"" is needed from the RBI and the MPC members to come out with interest rate forecasts. ""The MPC statement does include fan charts of projected inflation and growth which provide information about both the expected path as well as the range of uncertainty. Individual members' views might reflect different nuances,"" Varma told Moneycontrol."
5,"Africa must end food, pharma import dependence, African Development Bank president says",economy," Africa must wean itself off dependence on food and medicine imports, the president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) said, as the institution approved creation of a pharmaceutical tech foundation and began processing requests for food relief. Africa was hit hard by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Now, as many countries are still struggling to rebound, they are facing rising inflation and food shortages aggravated by the war in Ukraine. ""Africa should not allow itself to be vulnerable in excessively depending on others, whether it is for vaccines or whether it is for food,"" AfDB president Akinwumi Adesina told Reuters on the sidelines of a meeting of Commonwealth leaders in Kigali. ""The fact is that when you are dependent on others, you are also very highly vulnerable to any shock of any kind."" The bank last month approved a $1.5 billion financing facility for emergency food production, with the aim of averting a looming food crisis. The funds are meant to help 20 million farmers produce 38 million tonnes of food. Adesina said the bank had already received requests from countries to draw on the fund. ""Once those things come to our board, they are swiftly reviewed and approved, and the money is out at the door,"" he said. Meanwhile, the AfDB's board this week approved the creation of a new Africa Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation. Adesina said the foundation would allow Africa to leverage intellectual property rights, protected technologies and innovations to expand Africa's pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing sectors. ""Africa imports 80% to 90% of all its medicines for a population of 1.3 billion people. We cannot and we must not outsource the health security of Africa to the benevolence of others,"" he said. The World Trade Organization last week agreed on a partial waiver of intellectual property rights to allow developing countries to produce and export COVID-19 vaccines."
6,"Investment through participatory notes declines to Rs 86,706 crore in May",economy," Investment in the Indian capital markets through participatory notes (P-notes) dropped to Rs 86,706 crore till May-end from the preceding month, while experts say foreign investors will reverse their selling stance and return to the country's equities in the coming 1-2 quarters. P-notes are issued by registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to overseas investors who wish to be a part of the Indian stock market without registering themselves directly. They, however, need to go through a due diligence process. According to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) data, the value of P-note investments in Indian markets -- equity, debt, and hybrid securities -- stood at Rs 86,706 crore at May-end compared to Rs 90,580 crore at April-end. In March, the investment was at Rs 87,979 crore. It was Rs 89,143 crore in February and Rs 87,989 crore in January. Of the total Rs 86,706 crore invested through the route till May 2022, Rs 77,402 crore was invested in equities, Rs 9,209 crore in debt, and Rs 101 crore in hybrid securities. In comparison, Rs 81,571 crore was invested in equities and Rs 8,889 crore in debt during April. ""In terms of ODI (offshore derivative instruments) in equity and debt, we have reached back to the levels of December 2020. ""However, if we look forward from here, most of the pain is factored in with the increase in 10-year bond yields, and equity markets showing significant drawdown,"" said Divam Sharma, founder at Green Portfolio, a portfolio management service provider. There is still an uncertainty around inflation levels and the US Federal Bank's actions. Besides, currency correction has happened to a large extent. ""Equity markets are offering some attractive valuations at these levels and the supply chain, and inflation issues should begin to subside over the coming months. Markets usually move ahead of the economic cycle and we believe that over the coming 1-2 quarters, we should see FPIs coming back to allocating capital towards Indian equities,"" he added. In line with decline in P-notes investment, the assets under the custody of FPIs dropped by 5 per cent Rs 48.23 lakh crore at May-end from Rs 50.74 lakh crore at April-end. Sharma attributed a large part of this reduction to the market correction in equity and debt portfolios. Meanwhile, foreign investors withdrew nearly Rs 40,000 crore from Indian equities and Rs 5,505 crore from the debt markets last month on fears of an aggressive rate hike by the US Fed that haunted such investors and dented sentiments."
7,IEA chief warns Europe to prepare for total shutdown of Russian gas exports,economy," David Sheppard, Energy Editor

The International Energy Agency has warned that Europe must prepare immediately for the complete severance of Russian gas exports this winter, urging governments to take measures to cut demand and keep ageing nuclear power stations open.

Fatih Birol, the head of the IEA, said Russia’s decision to reduce gas supplies to European countries in the past week may be a precursor to further cuts as Moscow looks to gain “leverage” during its war with Ukraine.

13,Chart of the Day: Hurtling towards a wide current account deficit,economy,"  India’s current account deficit (CAD) for FY22 widened to $38.7 billion or 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from $23.7 billion (0.9 percent of GDP) in FY21. The wider deficit is on expected lines as a surge in global oil prices inflated the petroleum and oil bill for the economy during the year. As a result, the trade deficit widened sharply by $185.5 billion. Since oil prices are likely to remain elevated, economists expect the CAD to widen further in the coming year. What’s more is that the odds of a recession in the US have risen which could dampen the prospects for exports as the country remains the biggest export destination for Indian goods and services."
14,GST council to consider sales tax on cryptocurrency next week,economy," An Indian ministerial panel will meet next week to discuss a goods and services tax on cryptocurrency transactions, people with knowledge on the matter said. The panel, comprising federal and states’ finance ministers, is seeking to broaden the tax net to track dealings in virtual digital assets in a more effective manner, the people said, declining to be identified citing rules on speaking with media. The panel is meeting for two days starting June 28 in the northern Indian state of Chandigarh. The panel is unlikely to finalize a rate in the upcoming meeting but discussions may be held on placing it in the highest tax slab of 28%, the people said. A finance ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to calls seeking comments. Earlier this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman imposed a levy of 30% on income from transfer of virtual assets and a 1% tax at source on all crypto transactions in a bid to assess the size of crypto market in the country and track users. The move was seen as removing uncertainty about the legal status of crypto transactions. However, there is still no clarity on imposition of a sales tax on digital currencies due to ambiguity in its treatment as goods or services and a lack of a regulatory framework. The federal government is already working on a legislation to either regulate or tighten provisions though it is expected only after a global consensus emerges on regulating such assets, Bloomberg had earlier reported."
15,Bangladesh tries to secure wheat from Russia as India stops exports: Sources,economy," Bangladesh is trying to secure wheat supplies from Russia in a government-to-government deal after it's biggest supplier India banned exports of the grain last month to contain local prices, government and trade officials told Reuters on Wednesday. The supply deal with Russia, the world's biggest wheat exporter, could help Dhaka in meeting its needs below the elevated global prices, industry officials said. Bangladesh is holding a virtual meeting with Russia on Thursday to finalise the deal, said a senior official with Bangladesh's food ministry. ""We'll initially seek at least 200,000 tonnes of wheat from Russia,"" said the official, who declined to be named. The Ministry of Food did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bangladesh imports around 7 million tonnes of wheat and last year more than-two thirds of that came from India. After India's export ban, Bangladesh tried to secure supplies via international tenders but has cancelled them because of high prices. Bangladesh was paying less than $400 per tonne on the cost and freight basis for Indian wheat, but after the ban other suppliers started quoting above $460, which raised local prices in Bangladesh, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm. The Bangladesh government is struggling to contain soaring commodity prices, with inflation at an eight-year high in May, while the country's wheat stocks hit their lowest in three years at 166,000 tonnes. ""There are many countries who can supply wheat to Bangladesh, but key issue is price. Russia can offer discount over global prices,"" said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm. But paying for Russian wheat would be a challenge for Dhaka given Western sanctions on Moscow. ""All the issues, including payment, will be discussed in the meeting. Let's see,"" the government official said."
16,Russian oil tankers get India safety cover via Dubai company,economy," India is providing safety certification for dozens of ships managed by a subsidiary of top Russian shipping group Sovcomflot, official data showed, enabling oil exports to India and elsewhere after Western certifiers withdrew their services due to global sanctions against Moscow. Certification by the Indian Register of Shipping (IRClass), one of the world's top classification companies, provides a final link in the paperwork chain - after insurance coverage - needed to keep state-owned Sovcomflot's tanker fleet afloat and delivering Russian crude oil to overseas markets. Data compiled from the IRClass website shows that it has certified more than 80 ships managed by SCF Management Services (Dubai) Ltd, a Dubai-based entity listed as a subsidiary on Sovcomflot's website. An Indian shipping source familiar with the certification process said most of Sovcomflot's vessels had now migrated to IRClass, via the Dubai arm. Classification societies certify that ships are safe and seaworthy, which is essential for securing insurance and for gaining access to ports. Russia's crude oil sector, hit by strict sanctions due to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, has been forced to seek buyers outside the West while turning to Russian transporters and insurers to handle its exports. India, which has refrained from condemning Russia given its longstanding security ties, has sharply boosted Russian crude oil purchases in recent months. Western sanctions against Russia prompted many oil importers to shun trade with Moscow, pushing spot prices for Russian crude to record discounts against other grades. That provided Indian refiners, which rarely used to buy Russian oil due to high freight costs, an opportunity to snap up low-priced crude. Russian grades accounted for about 16.5% of India's overall oil imports in May, compared with about 1% in all of 2021. TOP TIER India's ship certifier is one of 11 members of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), top-tier certifiers that account for more than 90% of the world's cargo-carrying tonnage. The Russia Maritime Register of Shipping was also part of the group until March, when its membership was withdrawn following a vote by 75% of IACS' members. Membership in IACS, which sets technical standards, typically makes a certifier more attractive for insurers, ports, flag registries and shipowners seeking safety assurances. The four leading IACS members, from the UK, Norway, France and the United States, have stopped services to Russian companies due to the sanctions. A spokesperson for IRClass, however, when asked about the certification data for Sovcomflot's fleet, responded: ""Indian Register of Shipping, as an international ship classification society, reiterates that we have not classed vessels which are owned, flagged or managed by Russian companies."" The spokesperson declined to comment further on the matter, including on the Dubai unit's connection to its Russian parent. Sovcomflot is subject to sanctions and other restrictions by the UK and the European Union, while Washington has restricted its financial activities. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An IACS spokesman said that IRClass' actions were not a matter for discussion by the association. ""IACS is not involved in the operational and commercial activities of its members, including appraisal, approval surveying and testing of vessels and equipment and the issuing of classification and statutory certificates where authorised,"" he said. ""As such, these developments do not get discussed within the association."" Sovcomflot's chief executive told reporters last week that the group had insured all its cargo ships with Russian insurers and the cover met international rules."
17,Pakistan signs $2.3 billion loan facility agreement with China,economy," Pakistan on Wednesday signed a 15 billion yuan (USD 2.3 billion) loan facility agreement with a Chinese consortium of banks to help the country's cash-strapped economy in the wake of depleting foreign exchange reserves and depreciation of its local currency. Pakistan Finance Minister Miftah Ismail in a tweet said that the ""Chinese consortium of banks has today (Wednesday) signed the RMB 15 billion (USD 2.3 billion) loan facility agreement after it was signed by the Pakistani side yesterday (Tuesday)"". Thanking the Chinese government for ""facilitating this transaction"", Ismail said the ""inflow was expected within a couple of days"". Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese leadership. ""The people of Pakistan are grateful for the continued support of our all-weather friends,"" he said. Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese leadership. The loan agreement with Chinese banks will boost the crisis-hit Pakistan's reserves and enable Islamabad to make import payments while lending some support to the rupee as well. The Pakistani rupee has lost over 34 per cent since the beginning of the outgoing fiscal year 2021-22. The latest development comes as a massive relief to economic policymakers after foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) fell below USD 9 billion as of June 10, with the level staying at less than six weeks of import cover. The deal with China also came on a day when reports emerged of Pakistan reaching an understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to restore the stalled USD 6 billion assistance package from the global lender. It will also prop up Pakistan's dwindling cash reserves which are at USD 8.99 billion, as per data from the central bank, the Dawn newspaper reported. The deal with the IMF is expected to unlock doors for financing from other international sources. The revival of the facility will immediately provide access to USD 1 billion, which Pakistan badly needs to buttress its dwindling foreign exchange reserves. The Finance Minister had last week warned that Pakistan's economy could be in a similar position as that of Sri Lanka if tough decisions were not taken."
18,India's January-March current account deficit falls to $13.4 billion; FY22 CAD at three-year high,economy," India's current account deficit (CAD) fell to $13.4 billion in January-March 2022 from $22.2 billion in October-December 2021, according to data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on June 22. The deficit was $8.1 billion in January-March 2021. In percentage terms, the CAD in January-March 2022 was 1.5 percent of GDP, down from 2.6 percent of GDP the previous quarter. ""The sequential decline in CAD in Q4:2021-22 (January-March) was mainly on account of a moderation in trade deficit and lower net outgo of primary income,"" the central bank said. India's merchandise trade deficit fell to $54.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022 from $59.8 billion the previous quarter, helping bring down the CAD. On the services front, the trade surplus edged up marginally to $28.3 billion from $27.8 billion in October-December 2021. Also helping the current account deficit to moderate was a lower net outgo of primary income, which amounted to $8.4 billion last quarter. In October-December 2021, the net outgo of primary income was $11.5 billion. Primary income includes compensation of employees and investment income. While there was a decline in quarterly current account deficit, India's current account deficit for FY22 was at a three-year high of $38.7 billion, thanks to the merchandise trade deficit nearly doubling to $189.5 billion from $102.2 billion in FY21. FY22 saw India's import bill rising on two accounts - higher imports following a recovery in economic activity as well as higher global commodity prices, including those of crude oil. In percentage terms, the CAD posted a deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP in FY22, up from 0.9 percent of GDP in FY21."
19,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | No quick fix for inflation,economy," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Inflation is the topic of the moment, not just for central bankers, but also for households, markets, governments and corporates. In fact, companies have been taking innovative steps to tackle it. For India, inflation traditionally has a lot to do with energy prices, though food prices have also played their part. This time around too, fuel-led inflation has impacted the country, but at the same time high fuel prices and commodity prices along with logistic issues on account of the Russia-Ukraine war have resulted in fertiliser prices shooting up. The government has tried to absorb the impact of higher fertiliser costs by extending subsidies. Fertiliser subsidy during the year is expected to touch Rs 2.5 lakh crore, the highest ever. But supply side issues and high transportation costs have caused food inflation to raise its head. Vivek Kelkar in his article points out the complex nature of the crisis in food inflation. He talks about how the closure of fertiliser units on account of high energy prices is causing food inflation. Global food and commodity supply chains today are extraordinarily complex systems, where direct and indirect links are so intertwined that the butterfly effect comes into play, he says. As for energy prices, Indian refiners have increased the usage of Russian crude. Media reports say India’s bill for imports from Russia has jumped 3.5 times in a year in April to $2.3 billion. Russia is now the fourth-largest crude petroleum supplier to India, after Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Reliance and Rosneft-owned Nayara Energy accounted for 69 percent of the discounted imports from Russia. Indian companies are taking advantage of the discount offered by Russia, though they are not passing on the entire benefit to the consumers. However, indirectly, lower import costs benefit the country. The fact is that unless international prices of energy come down, the benefit will not be available to the common man and thus to the economy and markets. Manas Chakravarty in his article argues that investors would do well to keep a close watch on energy and commodity costs and the easing of supply chain disruptions. The main weapon that central banks have traditionally been using to control inflation is interest rates. This time around too, controlling rates is the foremost weapon in their arsenal. Manish Banthia believes that in terms of interest rate outlook, the RBI will take interest rates to a neutral zone and stop there. There is a limit to which interest rates can be raised without harming the economic recovery. The battle against inflation is being fought on various fronts. While the retail consumer curtails her purchases to shelter herself from inflationary pressures, corporates use their ability to control cost, squeeze suppliers and use alternative resources. In the long run, overall inflation needs to come down and that can be possible with either increased supply by debottlenecking and higher production, or lower demand. There is no quick-fix and painless solution to higher inflation.  How is Castrol placed, post the de-rating of the sector? JK Paper: Premium is on quality What else are we reading?

21,"Real Estate | RERA has empowered homebuyers, but it’s a long road ahead",economy," The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) was passed by Parliament in March 2016, and came into effect from May 1, 2016. Last month it completed six years. In these years, it is clear that the legal framework aimed at empowering India’s homebuyers has been further fortified through various decisions of the Supreme Court and other judicial forums. The fact that the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary realised that homebuyers were being cheated by many builders who took away their life’s savings is RERA’s biggest success. Though the first couple of years were spent getting the implementation architecture in place, including early successes in project and agent registrations, recently the regulatory authorities and the appellate tribunals have begun asserting their power. This is another success of RERA, and a pointer of things to come in the interest of homebuyers. The apex court, while deciding the case of Newtech Promoters and Developers Pvt. Ltd. vs State of UP & Others, held that the regulatory authority has the power to order refund, interest and penalty, and that the adjudicating officer has the power to award compensation. It also said that the regulatory authority can delegate its powers to a single member to hear complaints; or the pre-condition of deposit under proviso to Section 43(5) for entertaining appeals, are in sync with the Constitution of India. Thus, in one stroke, it empowered millions of homebuyers. The pre-condition of deposit for filing appeals by the builders was conceptualised in the law to be a deterrent to ensure that builders don’t conjure up filing appeals to avoid regulatory orders. This is a huge win for the homebuyers, hoping early resolution of disputes. Judicial alacrity was visible in Uttar Pradesh, where in a case pertaining the refund of homebuyers’ money, the Allahabad High Court ordered the Gautam Buddh Nagar District Magistrate to appear before the court, albeit virtually. This helped in the early disposal of the case with the homebuyer getting his life savings back. In a case in Gurugram, Haryana, RERA issued arrest warrants against the directors of a real estate company, and in another it directed to freeze all bank accounts associated with a real estate entity. Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh, RERA imposed a penalty of Rs 1.40 crore on nine builders for non-compliance of its orders. Exercising its powers, in Maharashtra, MahaRERA directed a builder to pay Rs 10,000 daily until handing over of possession of a flat. These and many such decisions have emboldened the will, desire, and dedication of real estate regulatory authorities to dispense justice. Likewise, the recently-held meeting of the Central Advisory Council (CAC) under RERA, comprising senior functionaries of the Government of India and state governments, was live streamed. This has instilled a feeling of hope and confidence among homebuyers that public policy and decisions are not going to be made at the behest of powerful lobbies, but in full public glare in the interests of the public. The CAC took some important decisions, namely: the constitution of a committee comprising homebuyers’ representatives to review cases where orders passed have not been implemented; the mandate to form a sub-group under the chairpersonship of the Secretary, Mo/HUA, to meet at least every six months to resolve homebuyers’ issues; the ministry, homebuyers, and builder representatives to jointly petition the Government of West Bengal and Telangana to implement RERA expeditiously; among others. This was the first CAC meeting that addressed homebuyer concerns, showing the way forward. Challenges Ahead Despite these successes, it would be imprudent not to spell out lapses, and deficiencies. The real estate sector is far from removing malpractices that make it infamous. Homebuyers aren’t yet sure if project registration with RERA authorities guarantees its timely possession with all promised amenities. Homebuyers still dread the possibility of the builder vanishing with their hard-earned money, or miring them in unnecessary and burdensome litigation. This is one area where RERA falls short of expectations. The fault is not with the law, but with those who are responsible for its enforcement. The responsibility to restore trust in the sector and confidence of the prospective homebuyers lies squarely on the regulatory authorities. It should be their endeavour to proactively act, and not just react. They should develop mechanisms of intelligent input systems by which they can intervene in projects well on time, and bring them back on track before it’s too late, including spot checks to ensure all promised amenities are provided. This would also help avoid unnecessary litigation. Without doubt, on the ground RERA has made its presence felt in the interest of homebuyers, and has instilled fear among unscrupulous builders. However, though we have come a long way in these past six years, there is yet a long way to go before we can truly say RERA has succeeded in reforming and professionalising the real estate sector. With the kind of sensitivities shown by the Supreme Court towards suffering homebuyers, and the new-found zeal shown by executives and the regulatory authorities, RERA will surpass the expectations of all stakeholders, ensuring that owning a house becomes seamless, and free of risk and malpractices.

22,Rupee plunges by 27 paise to record low of 78.40 against US dollar,economy," The rupee declined by 27 paise to a record low of 78.40 (provisional) against theUS dollar on Wednesday due to unabated foreign fund outflows and losses in the domestic equities. A stronger greenback overseas also weighed on the rupee sentiment, forex traders said. However, receding crude prices in the international market restricted the rupee's loss, they added. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened flat at 78.13 against the greenback and witnessed an intra-day high of 78.13 and a low of 78.40. The domestic unit finally ended at a record low of 78.40, down 27 paise over its previous close. In the previous session, the rupee had settled at 78.13 against the US dollar. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, strengthened by 0.05 per cent to 104.48. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, dropped 4.46 per cent to USD 109.54 per barrel. On the domestic equity market front, the BSE Sensex ended 709.54 points or 1.35 per cent lower at 51,822.53, while the broader NSE Nifty fell 225.50 points or 1.44 per cent to 15,413.30. Foreign institutional investors remained net sellers in the capital market on Monday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 2,701.21 crore, according to the stock exchange data."
23,Indian delegation led by Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran to visit Sri Lanka tomorrow,economy," An Indian government delegation led by Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran will arrive here on Thursday to assess Sri Lanka's economic conditions and examine whether another tranche of financial package needs to be disbursed to the island nation, which is in the midst of an unprecedented economic turmoil. The delegation led by Nageswaran will stay in the country for three hours and hold talks with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe, according to the Daily Mirror newspaper. The visit is consequent to the meetings held by Sri Lankan envoy in New Delhi Milinda Moragoda with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on June 20, the report said. India has extended multi-pronged assistance to the people of Sri Lanka in the last few months in line with its Neighbourhood First' policy and as an earnest friend and partner of Sri Lanka. The support from India ranges from economic assistance of close to USD 3.5 billion to helping secure Sri Lanka's food, health, and energy security by supplying essential items like food, medicines, fuel, kerosene etc, according to the Indian High Commission here. On Wednesday, Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced in Parliament that a team of high-ranking officials from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is due to arrive in Colombo on Thursday to assess the local economic conditions. Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka is now facing a far more serious situation beyond the mere shortages of fuel, gas, electricity and food. Our economy has faced a complete collapse. That is the most serious issue before us today. These issues can only be resolved through the reviving of the Sri Lankan economy. In order to do this, we must first resolve the foreign reserves crisis faced by us, he said. Our economy has faced a complete collapse. That is the most serious issue before us today. He said it is no easy task to revive a country with a completely collapsed economy, especially one that is dangerously low on foreign reserves. Sri Lanka has been facing the worst economic crisis since independence in 1948 which has prompted an acute shortage of essential items like food, medicine, cooking gas and fuel across the island nation."
24,India unlikely to offer tax waivers to fast track global bond index inclusion - sources,economy," India is opposed to providing any capital gains tax waivers to overseas debt investors even if it delays its goal of getting its bonds included in global bond indexes, two sources familiar with the matter said. The Indian government had initiated the process of listing its debt in global indexes in 2019, and has been in discussions with J.P.Morgan and Bloomberg-Barclays while also talking to Euroclear with regards to clearing and settlement. Under existing rules, an overseas investor is required to pay a short-term capital gains tax of 30% if a listed bond is sold within 12 months. The global bond index listing plan was widely expected to be announced early this year but the government's insistence on capital gains has slowed talks with index operators, officials privy to discussions told Reuters. The finance ministry did not immediately reply to a mail and a message seeking comments. In October last year, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said the index inclusion was in an advanced stage of discussions with major index providers and should happen ""maybe in the next few months"". ""The taxation part of it is the only thing that is yet to be resolved. But there is no rationale to tax citizens and not tax overseas investors,"" a senior source aware of the discussions said. Domestic investors have to pay short-term capital gains tax on debt investments as per their prevailing tax slabs and additional 4% cess. ""The risks of such index inclusions have always been there and though India is in a much better shape now, globally things are fairly volatile and it may not necessarily be the best time to go for this,"" he added. Index inclusion will aid sentiment in the near-term and incremental foreign investment inflows over the medium term would help policymakers to buy some time until the global market conditions become somewhat easier to navigate, Deutsche Bank said in a recent note. ""Global bond index inclusion is not a panacea for all the challenges faced by India at this juncture, but at least it can help on the margin,"" the bank said."

0,Oil slumps by around $5 as Biden calls for fuel tax cut,economy," Oil prices tumbled on Wednesday amid a push by U.S. President Joe Biden to cut taxes on fuel to cut costs for drivers amid aggravated relations between the White House and the U.S. oil industry. Brent crude futures were down $4.65, or 4.1%, at $110.00 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell $5.08, or 4.6%, to $104.44 by 0918 GMT. Earlier in the session, both contracts had shed over $6 each to hit their lowest levels since May 19 and 12, respectively. Biden on Wednesday is expected to ask Congress to greenlight a three-month suspension of the 18.4 cents per gallon federal tax on gasoline and call on states to suspend their fuel taxes, a senior administration official said. Lawmakers of both major parties have expressed resistance to suspending the federal tax. ""The latest in a long line of attempts to temper surging prices at the pumps is having the desired effect. Yet whether this knee-jerk reaction will stand the test of time is by no means guaranteed,"" said PVM's Stephen Brennock, pointing to an expected summer demand surge. Biden is expected to make the announcement at 1800 GMT. The White House asked the CEOs of seven oil companies to a meeting this week to discuss ways to increase production capacity and reduce fuel prices of around $5 a gallon as they make record profits. Chevron CEO Michael Wirth said criticising the oil industry was not the way to bring down fuel prices and that the government had to change its approach. Biden replied commenting on the industry's easily hurt feelings. Global supply is still expected to lag demand growth, as flagged by trading giant Vitol and Exxon Mobil Corp this week. The $2.4 trillion set to be invested in energy this year includes record spending on renewables but falls short of plugging a supply gap and tackling climate change, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, U.S. oil refining capacity fell in 2021 for the second year in a row, government data showed on Tuesday."
1,"Indian assistance, not 'charitable donations' in Lanka crisis: Ranil Wickremesinghe",economy," Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday told Parliament that financial assistance provided by India are not ""charitable donations"" and the island nation facing severe economic crisis must have a plan to repay these loans. Sri Lanka has been facing the worst economic crisis since independence in 1948 which has prompted an acute shortage of essential items like food, medicine, cooking gas and fuel across the island nation. We have taken loans amounting to USD 4 billion under the Indian credit line. We have requested more loan assistance from our Indian counterparts. But even India will not be able to continuously support us in this manner. Even their assistance has its limits. On the other hand, we too must have a plan to repay these loans. These are not charitable donations, Wickremesinghe told Parliament in an update on the government's mitigation measures taken so far. He announced that a team of high ranking officials from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is due to arrive in Colombo on Thursday to assess the local economic conditions. Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka is now facing a far more serious situation beyond the mere shortages of fuel, gas, electricity and food. Our economy has faced a complete collapse. That is the most serious issue before us today. These issues can only be resolved through the reviving of the Sri Lankan economy. In order to do this, we must first resolve the foreign reserves crisis faced by us, he said. He said it is no easy task to revive a country with a completely collapsed economy, especially one that is dangerously low on foreign reserves. For Sri Lanka, the only safe option now is to hold discussions with the International Monetary Fund, he said. In fact, this is our only option. We must take this path. Our aim is to hold discussions with the IMF and arrive at an agreement to obtain an additional credit facility."" The nearly-bankrupt country, with an acute foreign currency crisis that resulted in foreign debt default, had announced in April that it is suspending nearly USD 7 billion foreign debt repayment due for this year out of about USD 25 billion due through 2026. Sri Lanka's total foreign debt stands at USD 51 billion. The Indian credit lines since January this year have provided a lifeline to Sri Lanka amidst growing public dissent over the worsening economic conditions. Wickremesinghe said next Monday, a team of representatives from the US Department of the Treasury will also arrive in Sri Lanka. We intend to enter into an official level agreement with the IMF by the end of July. As Wickremesinghe was making his statement, a media report from New York said Hamilton Reserve Bank, a US bank, has filed action against Sri Lanka for defaulting on a billion dollar sovereign bond maturing next month. It has alleged that the ruling Rajapaksa clan had orchestrated the default, who have been accused of mass scale corruption."
2,India needs $223 billion to meet 2030 renewable capacity goals: Report,economy," India will need USD 223 billion of investment to meet its goal of wind and solar capacity installations by 2030, according to a new report by research company BloombergNEF (BNEF). The government has set a target of increasing non-fossil power capacity to 500 GW by 2030. It wants non-fossil fuel power sources to provide half of its electricity supply by 2030. ""To achieve this target, India needs to massively scale up funding for renewables,"" the report said, adding that USD 223 billion is required over the next eight years just to meet the solar and wind capacity targets. At COP26 in November 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India plans to reduce emission intensity by more than 45 per cent by 2030 to below 2005 levels. He also announced a net-zero by 2070 target. The report 'Financing India's 2030 Renewables Ambition', published in association with the Power Foundation of India, found that corporate commitments from Indian companies could help India achieve 86 per cent of its 2030 goals of building 500GW of cumulative non-fossil power generation capacity, a statement issued by BNEF said. By 2021, 165 GW of zero-carbon generation had already been installed in the country. Central Electricity Authority forecasts that the country's reliance on coal to drop from 53 per cent of installed capacity in 2021 to 33 per cent in 2030, whereas solar and wind together make up 51 per cent by then, up from 23 per cent in 2021. Shantanu Jaiswal, lead author of the report and head of India research at BloombergNEF, said: ""To date, the growth of renewable energy in India has been funded by a diverse set of financiers. Debt and equity structures have evolved as the market grew and new risks emerged. India's ambitious renewable energy targets now require further scaling up of financing with new instruments and learnings from other global markets"". Yet, the scaling up of renewables in India faces regulatory, project and financing risks, with PPA renegotiation, land acquisition and payment delays cited as key risks by industry stakeholders surveyed by BloombergNEF. In the short-term, rising interest rates, a depreciating rupee and high inflation create challenges for the financing of renewables. ""Scaling up financing to meet 2030 goals requires Independent Power Producers to tap into new or underutilised sources of capital. These could be revolving construction debt, investment infrastructure trusts and funding from retail investors, insurance companies and pension funds."
3,"The big risk to equities now is earnings, not valuations",economy," Ian Harnett

As global equities go deeper into bear market territory, it is important to recognise the unusual nature of this sell-off.

The pain so far has come largely from a contraction on the valuation placed on the more expensive stocks and their earnings prospects. This means we have probably only seen the first phase of this bear market.

With valuations having come down so far, the greatest risk to equities now comes from actual earnings falling short of current expectations. The..."

The CF Industries plant supplied fertilizers, and the byproduct carbon dioxide, to mainly domestic consumers in the UK. It wasn’t a hugely consequential loss to the global fertilizer industry. But the reason it shut down its operations was significant. As the tensions over food supply across the world deepen, and food..."
5,Bear Market Woes: 83% of Nifty 500 stocks give negative returns in 2022,economy," The ongoing downturn in the domestic stock market has seen nearly 83 percent of the stocks forming the Nifty 500 index, a collection of the biggest companies in the country, deliver flat or negative returns in 2022 so far. Many of these stocks are hovering below their 52-week lows and their 200-day moving average (DMA), data compiled by Moneycontrol showed. So far this year, the Nifty 500 index lost 12 percent, while the BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 have declined nearly 10 percent each. Companies that have seen the most erosion in their stock prices since the start of this year include Dhani Services, Solara Active Pharma, Brightcom Group, Indiabulls Real Estate, Metropolis Healthcare, Hikal, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Dilip Buildcon, Welspun India, Nazara Tech, One97 Communications, Zomato and Sterlite Tech, which have lost 40-80 percent. Nifty 50 stocks such as Hindalco Industries, Tata Steel, BPCL, IndusInd Bank, Shree Cement, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Wipro, Infosys, HDFC, HCL Technologies, Bajaj Finance, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra, and Grasim Industries hit one-year lows recently. All these stocks are down between 8-40 percent this year. ""The broader market has been under pressure mainly due to the heavy FII selling. Concerns of premium valuation and higher impact of inflation on their profitability led to sharper fall in broader markets"" said Sneha Poddar, AVP, Research Analyst, Broking and Distribution, MOFSL However, the sharp correction in the market is also being seen as an opportunity by some market participants. “I think it's the right time for long-term investors to add to good growth stocks, which are available at attractive valuations,” Narendra Solanki, Head-Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, said. Solanki believes investors should continue to hold existing stocks in their portfolios, if growth prospects of the company are intact as the “current volatility is more in the short-to-medium term, while long-term prospects for our economy remain promising”. Analysts attribute the negative or low returns in some popular consumer durables, auto, banking, realty and metal stocks that are actively traded in futures and options (F&O) on the perception that higher cost of borrowing and product prices will hurt demand at a time when companies are grappling with persistently high input prices. Metal stocks have already been under pressure since the government’s decision to impose export duty on steel to cool domestic prices. Among IT stocks, volatility in the global markets amid higher inflation and expectations of tightening by central banks, along with the Russia-Ukraine war, which is unlikely to end soon, may see a slowdown in order books. Most Indian IT companies are moving their operations out of Russia, while helping clients maintain business continuity by shifting work to other locations. This is likely to increase margin pressures further, analysts said. Oil & gas stocks were under pressure as investors feared that interest rate hikes from major central banks could slow the global economy and cut demand for energy. Vikram Kasat, Head-Advisory at Prabhudas Lilladher expects markets to remain volatile for the next three months as he believes inflation is likely to remain high and geo political tensions will not end soon."

7,RBI will take interest rates to a neutral zone and stop there,economy," Manish Banthia

The monetary policy for the last two years was largely crisis management given the pandemic times. However, post 2021, as growth started to recover, it was required for the Reserve Bank of India to normalize interest rates. Given that fiscal support in India was not as large in comparison to the US, the recovery seen in India was gradual. With the crisis behind us now, it is imperative we move to a more neutral stance in terms of..."
8,Why central banks may have to raise interest rates sharply to lower inflation,economy," The markets seem to be worried that too much monetary tightening by the US Fed would tip the US economy into a recession. And since what happens in US markets reverberates around global markets, via the US dollar and fund flows, the probability of the US Fed overshooting is one that should concern all investors.

But surely the central bank knows what it is doing. Some economists believe the Fed often makes mistakes and point to the excesses built up..."
9,"Oversupply of India bonds to drive yields to 8%, StanChart says",economy," A supply glut is set to hit India’s government bond market, and drive benchmark yields toward 8% by year-end, according to Standard Chartered Plc. “It may keep becoming incrementally more difficult for supply to be absorbed by the market,” said Sinha, who has spent more than a decade trading currencies and rates in London, Singapore and Mumbai. “Supply worries will increase from July and with interest rates normalizing to a higher trajectory and liquidity surplus decreasing –- all these three factors can come together.” Rupee bonds have maintained a semblance of stability amid the selloff in global debt, with recent auctions drawing decent demand as the central bank vowed to ensure the orderly completion of the government’s borrowing program. Still, there are signs that the calm may be shattered after benchmark 10-yields soared to the highest since 2019 last week. Indian authorities are looking to sell a record 14.3 trillion rupees of bonds this fiscal year as they boost spending to spur growth while tax cuts erode public revenue. To make matters worse, the central bank is expected to hike rates further after 90 basis points of increases in the last two meetings while also mopping up excess liquidity to tame prices that are running above its target band. StanChart estimates that excess bond supply may total between 3.8 trillion rupees to 6.3 trillion rupees this fiscal year, according to a June 8 note. All these negatives have fueled a six-month drop in benchmark 10-year debt, and analysts at Citigroup Inc. are among those who predict that yields may climb as high as 8% from around 7.48% now. They last reached 8% in 2018. Bear Flattening The yield curve is likely to continue bear flattening, with shorter yields rising faster than longer rates, according to Sinha. “As more and more hikes get delivered, the five-year part of the curve will remain under pressure,” said Sinha. “The longer end demand is growing at a good pace -- the 15- to 30-year part of the curve remains well-anchored with demand from insurance companies.” Local investors who were sitting on excess cash have deployed some funds after yields climbed to the highest in over three years, said Sinha. She added that the RBI was unlikely to carry out another major bond purchase program like it did in the previous fiscal year, when it bought 2.2 trillion rupees of debt. “We are not in the camp that expects any big bond purchases from the RBI,” said Sinha. “If inflation cools down and big rate hikes don’t happen, you won’t anyways need to do that kind of intervention.”"
10,"Oil climbs $2 per barrel on strong demand, tight supply",economy," Oil rose $2 per barrel on Tuesday on high summer fuel demand while supplies remain tight because of sanctions on Russian oil after its invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude rose $2.06, or 1.8%, to $116.08 a barrel by 10:40 a.m. ET (1440 GMT). The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude contract for July, which expires later on Tuesday, rose $1.72, or 1.5%, to $111.28. The more active August contract was up $2.17 at $110.16. UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said that despite concerns over economic growth, latest data on flight activity and mobility on U.S. roads continues to show solid oil demand. ""We expect oil demand to improve further, benefiting from the reopening of China, summer travel in the northern hemisphere and the weather getting warmer in the Middle East. With supply growth lagging demand growth over the coming months, we continue to expect higher oil prices,"" he said. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that a decision on whether to pause a federal gasoline tax could come by the end of this week, as the United States struggles to tackle soaring fuel prices and inflation, now at its highest in 40 years. The United States is also in talks with Canada and other allies to further restrict Moscow's energy revenue by imposing a price cap on Russian oil, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday. The market has been supported by supply anxiety after sanctions on oil shipments from Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter, and questions over how Russian output might fall due to sanctions on equipment needed for production. European Union leaders aim to maintain pressure on Russia at their summit this week by committing to further work on sanctions, a draft document showed. ""Supply concerns are unlikely to subside unless there is a resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war, or unless we see a sharp rise in supply from either the U.S. or OPEC,"" said Madhavi Mehta, commodity research analyst at Kotak Securities. Prospects are receding for successful negotiation of a nuclear deal with Iran and a lifting of U.S. sanctions on the OPEC member's energy sector. Iran is escalating its uranium enrichment further by preparing to use advanced centrifuges at its underground Fordow site, a United Nations nuclear watchdog report seen by Reuters showed. ""Iran's measures, if correct, likely mean we wont be seeing a return of Iranian crude to greater world markets any time soon,"" said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley. U.S. petroleum inventory data is delayed this week because of Monday's public holiday, with industry data due on Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. and government data scheduled for Thursday at 11 a.m."
11,Rupee drops 15 paise to 78.13 against US dollar,economy," Snapping its three-day rising streak, the rupee declined 15 paise to close at 78.13 against the US dollar on Tuesday as persistent foreign fund outflows and a jump in crude oil prices weighed on investor sentiment. At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 78.00 and traded in a narrow range. It finally ended at 78.13, down 15 paise over its previous close of 77.98. ""This was another quiet day for the rupee even after strong intermarket cues. Global equities are up while the dollar is down against major trading currencies,"" said Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. Parmar further said higher crude oil prices and yields weighed on the domestic currency. ""The USD-INR has been in the range of 77.95 to 78.10 after touching an all-time high of 78.28 on June 13. ""Near-term bias for USD-INR remains range-bound within 77.70 to 78.30. Swing traders can use a lower range for long and cover at the upper range,"" Parmar said. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.68 per cent to 103.99. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, advanced 1.68 per cent to USD 116.05 per barrel. On the domestic equity market front, the BSE Sensex ended 934.23 points or 1.81 per cent up at 52,532.07, while the broader NSE Nifty jumped 288.65 points or 1.88 per cent to 15,638.80. Foreign institutional investors remained net sellers in the capital market on Tuesday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 2,701.21 crore, as per stock exchange data. ""Dollar retraced from higher levels ahead of Fed Chairman testimony that is scheduled tomorrow,"" said Gaurang Somaiya, Forex & Bullion Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services."
12,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | What is driving gains in Indian equities?,economy," Dear Reader, If the world’s largest economy, the US, is heading into a recession as feared, then markets are showing no signs of it today. Indeed, they appear to be unusually calm. Indian stocks, along with Asian equities, were trading with gains at noon, even though the rebound came after a severe correction. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s economic model says there is an 80 percent chance the US economy will have a hard landing, explains our Chart of the Day. Perhaps investors see the US recession as a distant event and believe in policymakers’ ability to smoothen the impact. US President Joe Biden says recession is avoidable. His Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, a former Fed chair, said a recession is not inevitable. Investors may as well be coming to terms with monetary policy realignment. The supply-chain constraints and COVID stimulus have fuelled inflation. Demand moderation can cool prices and bring equilibrium to the commodity markets. India is a large user of commodities. Metal prices have already begun to ease and that is seen to be aiding automobile companies. Moreover, the incoming economic data continue to hold out hope. Electricity generation is rising at a good pace. Passenger vehicle sales are holding up and the rainy season began on time. Our Economic Recovery Tracker is showing improvement in most weekly indicators. “Extending the current pessimism into a long term trend may not be necessary for domestic investing. Our markets will recover from the current bearish phase at the first signs of easing inflation,” writes market expert Shyam Sekhar in this piece. Indeed, analysts and brokerages have begun putting out notes on the stocks that have seen a steep fall and now offer investment potential. Our research team has written on one such sector: construction. Construction companies have a good order backlog and are guiding for healthy inflows in the current fiscal year. With raw material pass-through clauses in contracts, the companies are well placed in the current market situation, writes Bharat Gianani. Read to find out his preferred stocks in the sector. But investors should not mistake intermittent stock market rebounds for a broader recovery. Recessions can lead to a multi-year economic slowdown and drive cuts in earnings estimates. This is already visible in metal stocks. A steep economic slowdown can hit individual incomes and weigh on consumer demand, impacting other sectors. “Firms in China, India, and the Pacific region face higher downside risks (to their credit quality) due to a preponderance of asset-heavy sectors or a rapid increase in domestic interest rates,” warns S&P Global Ratings.

13,United States’ obsession with ‘tiny’ Russia will make China the real winner,economy," So United States President Joe Biden is considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese goods. At some point this was inevitable given the sheer scale to which his son and business interests are compromised to China. However, the curious thing is how minimal the impact will be on inflation back in the US. The most optimistic estimate is that it will save the average US family around $797 (Rs 63,000) — not enough to prevent a catastrophic wipeout in the mid-term congressional elections in November. Woke Policies So what lies behind this rearguard action? Much of the inflation we’re seeing has to do directly with the ultra-woke policies of the Democrats themselves, and very little to do with Russia. For example, much of the food inflation is coming about because of a slew of animal rights and sustainability legislation — in the same calibre of outlandishness as Sri Lanka’s push to go fully organic. It started off with pork and California legislating a minimum space requirement for each pig whose meat was to be sold in that state. While the space increase was negligible individually and the concern for animal welfare admirable, the immediate costs it imposed on porcine product manufacturers was debilitating. Obviously prices of pork and pork products - ham, bacon, sausages - all critical staple of the American diet, skyrocketed. This was followed by uncompromising stances on fossil fuels. The US technically extracts as much fossil fuel as it requires, though due to market inefficiencies it sells some of this abroad, and imports some. However, what a slew of legislation did was it dis-incentivised fossil fuel extractors from investing in surplus and future capacity which would’ve helped the US and global markets tide over the current fuel crisis. This suited both parties perfectly — a price rise in fuel would force consumers to switch to electric vehicles which suited the Democrats. The medium term disaffection would benefit the Republicans and force the Biden administration at some point to allow fracking again. Diplomatic Blunders Then there were the compound diplomatic blunders. The first was an entirely uncalled for cancellation of the F-35 sale to the United Arab Emirates; essentially punishment for torpedoing the Iran nuclear deal and aligning too closely with President Trump’s policies. This was followed by the clumsy, heavily-personalised ostracism of Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, for the alleged killing of a Washington Post journalist. As condemnable as that was, for a government to determine bilateral relations on a single point, for a single individual, smacks of atrocious diplomacy. Up to this point it was an equilibrium suited to everyone. But then came the Ukraine war, and a host of ill-considered sanctions. The ideators of these sanctions (like Daleep Singh) were lauded as ‘geniuses’ — but had to quit in ignominy for ‘personal reasons’ once the scale of the self-harm became evident. During the Raisina Dialogue in Delhi in April, some US policy-makers were boasting to this author in private that “Russia was so small it was irrelevant to the world economy”. Perhaps in isolation it was, but combined with the suicidal self-inflicted harm that the Democrats have imposed on the US, it is turning out to be fatal. Unlike past sanctions on single-product economies such as Iraq, Libya, or Venezuela, Russia though a commodities economy, is no single-product economy. It is an energy superpower, an agricultural superpower, and a commodities superpower being a major vendor of almost every single mineral critical to modern industry. You can’t just impose sanctions on ‘tiny’ Russia and hope to escape unharmed. Compound this with the fact that Riyadh and Abu Dhabi are now in no mood to help Washington with fuel prices unlike the 1990s, the options are looking increasingly bleak. More cautious Eurocrats would concede in private that European sanctions on Russia far exceeded what was necessary, and went into the territory of dangerous recklessness. So today, it is the US and Europe that have had to beat humiliating retreats from cherished energy policies and ‘human rights’-based foreign policies, while Russia shows no signs whatsoever of backing down. Advantage China But as delicious as this irony is, we see that the only real winner here is China. For starters, the US is so bogged down in a multi-policy, multi-front disaster that the appetite to punish China is much reduced. If it does indeed punish China, the cost to the West will be socio-economically catastrophic. Then we have the fact that China doesn’t do ‘allies’. Instead it prefers nuclear armed ‘free radicals’: irredentist states who are highly risk accepting and who destabilise entire regions. Like North Korea does East Asia, and Pakistan does South Asia. Today Russia has turned into China’s North Atlantic ‘Pakistan’. It is going to get progressively worse as the West now has very few sticks to punish Russia, and no carrots to incentivise Russian good behaviour. Essentially, the US is stuck with Russia, where India has been with Pakistan for the last 60-odd years: have a far more hostile enemy that is at your doorstep hurting you every day forcing you to divert precious resources to it; while you have neither the energy nor resources to face up to the bigger strategic enemy: China. The removal of China tariffs, if and when it happens, will be an acceptance of the fact that China’s ‘free radicals’ policy has won game, set and match; while the US’ ‘values based’ policy has essentially been an agglomeration of dead-end dunces.

14,Ruchir Sharma writes: Why China is not rising as a financial superpower,economy," China’s rise on the world stage is perhaps this century’s most frequently repeated news story. The country’s economic footprint has expanded spectacularly. Its widening military reach has made recent headlines. Yet as an aspiring financial superpower, China is going nowhere.

This has not happened before. The US rose as an economic force and then as a financial power, before the dollar became the world’s leading currency in the 1920s. Previous empires, from Britain to 15th century Portugal, followed a similar..."

Janet Yellen, currently Treasury Secretary and erstwhile Fed chair, said recently that a recession in the US is ‘not inevitable’.

20,US President Biden says he's considering a gasoline tax holiday,economy," President Joe Biden said Monday that he's considering a federal holiday on the gasoline tax, possibly saving Americans as much as 18.4 cents a gallon. Yes, I am considering it, Biden told reporters after taking a walk along the beach. I hope to have a decision based on the data Im looking for by the end of the week. The administration is increasingly looking for ways to spare Americans from higher prices at the pump, which began to climb last year and surged after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Gas prices nationwide are averaging just under $5 a gallon, according to AAA. The Biden administration has already released oil from the U.S. strategic reserve and increased ethanol blending for the summer, in additional to sending a letter last week to oil refiners urging them to increase their refining capacity. Yet those efforts have yet to reduce price pressures meaningfully, such that the administration is now considering a gas tax holiday. Taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel help to pay for highways. The Penn Wharton Budget Model released estimates Wednesday showing that consumers saved at the pump because of gas tax holidays in Connecticut, Georgia and Maryland. The majority of the savings went to consumers, instead of service stations and others in the energy sector."
21,Finance Ministry asks banks to expedite NPA resolution; focus on credit growth,economy," The Finance Ministry on Monday held a meeting with heads of public sector banks (PSBs) to review their annual performance and progress made by them on various government schemes. The meeting was scheduled to be chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, but she could not attend due to some other pressing engagement. However, the annual performance review of PSBs was chaired by Minister of State for Finance Bhagwat K Karad. Besides the minister, Financial Services Secretary Sanjay Malhotra and other senior officials of the Department of Financial Services (DFS) were present at the meeting. According to sources, banks were asked to sanction loans for productive sectors to accelerate the revival of the economy facing headwinds, including from the Russia-Ukraine war. During the Iconic Week celebration of the finance ministry earlier this month, banks conducted outreach programmes across the country where eligible borrowers have sanctioned loans on the spot. Banks have been asked to expedite non-performing assets (NPAs) resolution and focus on the recovery of bad loans, the sources said. The meeting took a stock of credit growth, asset quality and business growth plan of banks, sources said, adding non-performing assets (NPAs) of Rs 100 crore and the recovery status were also discussed. There was a comprehensive review of various segments and progress in the government schemes, including the Kisan Credit Card and Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS). In the Budget, the ECLGS was extended by a year till March 2023. Further, the guarantee cover for the scheme was expanded by Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 5 lakh crore. The coverage, scope, and extent of benefits under ECLGS 3.0 for hospitality, travel, tourism, and civil aviation sectors were expanded. Also, the credit limit for eligible borrowers was increased to 50 per cent of their fund-based credit outstanding from 40 per cent earlier. The enhanced limit is subject to a maximum of Rs 200 crore per borrower. Besides, the sources said, the review of capital requirements of banks and the financial inclusion drive were part of the agenda. It is to be noted that the meeting was held against the backdrop when all PSBs posted a profit in the second financial year in a row. They have more than doubled their net profit to Rs 66,539 crore in FY22. The collective profit of 12 state-owned banks together was Rs 31,820 crore in FY21. However, there were collective losses for five straight years during 2015-16 to 2019-20. The highest amount of net loss was registered in 2017-18 at Rs 85,370 crore, followed by Rs 66,636 crore in 2018-19; Rs 25,941 crore in 2019-20; Rs 17,993 crore in 2015-16 and Rs 11,389 crore in 2016-17. To improve the financial health of PSBs, the government implemented a comprehensive 4Rs strategy — recognition of NPAs transparently, resolution and recovery of value from stressed accounts, recapitalization of PSBs, and reforms in PSBs and the wider financial ecosystem — for a responsible and clean system."
22,EPFO Payroll: April records 9.23 lakh fresh additions to formal work,economy," At least 922,752 people joined formal work for the first time in April 2022, lower than March additions, the payroll data of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) showed on June 20. The new payroll additions recorded in April, the first month of FY23, are almost 45,000 less than the new additions in March, when the pension fund had added 968,163 new subscribers. In February, this number was 886,836 and in January 2022, it was 937,610, as per official data released in May As per provisional payroll data released by EPFO on Monday, at least 494,490 fresh additions were in the 18-25 age group, a key consideration while evaluating the labour market movement. Among other age cohorts, people above the age of 35 came second with nearly 169,597 fresh additions. While the growth in new payroll additions was slightly lower when compared with March numbers released in May 2022, EPFO said there is a sizable growth in net payroll additions. The retirement fund body said April 2022 saw a net addition of 17.07 lakh workers, as against 15.32 lakh reported in March 2022. A year-on-year comparison of net payroll data shows an increase of 4.32 lakh net subscribers in April 2022 as compared to the net subscription in April 2021. New payroll numbers are arrived by including fresh additions, number of exits from the EPFO system and those who came back after exiting earlier. The caveat is net additions fluctuate more than fresh additions. To be sure, these are provisional numbers and may change over the next few months. EPFO said a state-wise comparison of net payroll figures highlights that the establishments covered in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Gujarat and Delhi led job creation by adding approximately 11.6 lakh net subscribers during April. “Gender-wise analysis indicates that net female payroll addition is approximately 3.65 lakh during the month. Share of female enrolment is 21.38% of the total net subscriber addition during the month of April 2022 with an increase of 17,187 net enrolments over the previous month of March 2022,” EPFO said in a separate statement. The payroll data highlights net enrolment of female workforce in the organised sector, which has shown a growing trend for the last six months, the retirement fund added."
23,Worrying details could be hiding in sticky wholesale prices,economy," For a government that has been expending considerable capital in political risk and perception management over the last few months, the stubbornly-high price trends have created additional worry lines. Wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation has galloped to a record high of 15.9 percent in May. This is not a one-off statistical occurrence. The WPI, which is a kind of the Indian version of a producers’ price index, has remained in double-digits since April 2021. The average WPI-inflation in India has been 13.3 percent over the last 14 months, showing the stickiness, and implying that the current phase of price rise may not be a seasonal phenomenon. Food items appear to be a particular cause for concern. Sample this. During April 2021 to March 2022, the wholesale prices of manufactured food products have gone up by 14.35 percent on an average. This would, other things remaining the same, mean that the cost of producing such goods, which also includes processed foods from biscuits and breads to pastas and many juices, have gone up sharply. The case with cooking oil, the primary ingredient without which most Indian staple curries can’t be rustled up, is even worse. Wholesale prices of vegetables and animal oils and fats have risen by an eye-popping 48.23 percent in the last financial year. Raw and unprocessed vegetables have become troublingly costlier. Wholesale vegetable prices have gone up 18.54 percent in May, and 39.24 percent so far this financial year, compared to (-)8.11 percent last year. These details point towards a peculiar flux. Vegetable prices were relatively cheaper last year, but processed or manufactured food had seen a sharp spike. Ideally, the pattern should have been similar — manufactured food prices should have remained subdued if vegetable prices have remained cool. The high manufactured food prices could be partly explained by costlier fruits that saw wholesale prices rise by 20.70 percent, but still does not account for the nearly 50 percent rise in wholesale manufactured food prices. There is another unexplained factor. If wholesale prices have remained so high, why aren’t these showing up in retail prices too? The details of this could be hiding in multiple layers. WPI-based inflation, by definition, is what producers charge retailers. In many ways, the WPI represents farm gate and factory gate prices, upon which retailers add their margins, transport, and other costs, and applicable taxes that add up to the retail price label. Rise in retail prices have lagged wholesale prices mainly because of two reasons. One, retailers may have squeezed a bit of their margins fearing not to chase away customers. Two, there may be a sleight of weight that could have come into play. In other words, processed and manufactured foods may have seen their weight fall but sold at the same price. So, a customer may be getting 465 grams of tea, for instance, at the price that previously fetched them 500 grams. These may have been necessarily disclosed in the packaging. There is another question: Why were factory processed edible oil prices so high last year compared to this year (48.23 percent in April 2021-March 2022 compared to 13.19 percent in April-May this year)? The clue to that could be in COVID-19 waves. Factories had remained broadly shut for about five months last year, hammered first by the devastating Delta wave of COVID-19 during April-June, and then again laid low in January-February by the Omicron wave. Edible oil products are among the fastest moving in the fast-moving-consumer-goods (FMCG) basket given its necessity in daily food making compared to, say, biscuits or noodles. The relative high demand and the COVID-19-induced disruptions in production may explain high manufactured food wholesale prices last year. In the final analysis, a lot will depend on fresh arrival of supplies of seasonal vegetables and the summer-sown kharif crop. All eyes are on the monsoon rains and when they start lashing north-west India, the country’s grain bowl. Plentiful rains will help tame the price monster. The opposite, however, can queer the pitch further. Scanty rains, besides keeping food prices high, can adversely affect demand for a host of manufactured products in rural areas, from cars to houses."
24,Rupee gains 7 paise to close at 77.98 against US dollar,economy," The rupee appreciated by 7 paise to settle at 77.98 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday as crude oil prices retreated from elevated levels. However, unabated foreign fund outflows restricted the appreciation bias in the rupee, forex dealers said. At the interbank forex market, the local unit opened strong at 77.98 against the greenback and witnessed an intra-day high of 77.87 and a low of 78.03. It finally settled at 77.98, a rise of 7 paise over its previous close of 78.05. ""Rupee consolidated in a broad range despite volatility in domestic and global equities. Fed projection showed economic growth slowing to a below-trend rate of 1.7 per cent,"" said Gaurang Somaiya, Forex & Bullion Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. On the domestic equity market front, the BSE Sensex ended 237.42 points or 0.46 per cent higher at 51,597.84, while the broader NSE Nifty advanced 56.65 points or 0.37 per cent to 15,350.15. The dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, was down 0.37 per cent at 104.31. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 0.11 per cent to USD 112.99 per barrel."

0,Duty-related measures to slash steel exports from India by 40% in FY23: CRISIL,economy," India's steel exports is expected to come down by 40 per cent to 12 million tonnes (MT) in the ongoing fiscal, as a result of the duty-related measures taken by the government last month, according to CRISIL. The export of finished steel had reached a record high of 18.3 million tonnes in the 2021-22 financial year and the prices were at their all-time high, the agency said on Monday. On May 21, the government announced waiving of customs duty on the import of some raw materials, including coking coal and ferronickel, used by the steel industry. Also, the duty on exports of iron ore was hiked by up to 50 per cent and for a few steel intermediaries to 15 per cent. ""India's steel exports will drop 35-40 per cent to 10-12 million tonnes this fiscal following the 15 per cent export duty imposed on several finished steel products last month. Exports of iron ore and pellets will also fall this fiscal, and lower domestic prices,"" the CRISIL research analysis said. Steel exports had reached a record high of 18.3 MT last fiscal. However, it will continue to see momentum because of the disruptions caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and Russia is a key exporter of steel, coking coal and pig iron. In addition, the European Union's (EU) move to raise India's export quota amid a widening differential between steel prices in the two geographies benefited domestic steel makers, and limited the impact of a 25 per cent tariff on steel imports imposed by the EU, the report said. But while steel firms enjoyed fat realisations overseas, domestic demand grew 11 per cent year-on-year, driving domestic prices to all-time highs. This led to soaring construction costs and multiple price hikes by makers of automobiles, consumer appliances and durables to pass on the increase. The hike in export duty was aimed at curbing this inflation. Hetal Gandhi, Director, CRISIL Research said ""The duty-driven price correction will improve availability of steel in the domestic market as finished steel exports dwindle. This will directly impact India's export volume in the current fiscal. Steelmakers will attempt to skirt the duties by bumping up exports of alloyed steel and billets, but that is unlikely to compensate for the loss of finished steel exports."" CRISIL further said the combined export volume of iron ore and pellets is expected to see a massive drop from 26 MT last fiscal to 8-10 MT in the current one, and bring about a sharp correction in domestic prices. The removal of import duty on coking coal and PCI coal, meanwhile, has brought down the costs for integrated steel producers, who are largely dependent on the import market. On the prices of steel, it said the duty was able to tame the uncapped rally in domestic steel prices. Steel prices (ex-factory), which averaged Rs 77,000 per tonne in April, had already cooled off by Rs 4,000-5,000 per tonne in early May in line with global prices. On the prices of steel, it said the duty was able to tame the uncapped rally in domestic steel prices."
1,"Consumer durable stocks slide on falling demand, slowdown fears",economy," India's consumer durable stocks have been trading lower over fears that higher cost of borrowing and product prices would hurt demand at a time when companies are grappling with steep input prices. The BSE consumer durables index has fallen over 11 percent in the last 15 sessions, 12 of which ended in losses. Since the start of June, Amber Enterprises India has lost 21 percent, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail  16 percent, Titan Co Ltd  14 percent, Whirlpool Of India Ltd  13 percent, Dixon Technologies 13 percent, Havells India 12 percent, Blue Star 10 percent, Voltas 8.5 percent, Bajaj Electricals 7 percent, and Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals 5 percent. Rising interest rates are a key overhang for the consumer durable sector coupled with higher commodity prices, analysts say. Higher interest rates could deter consumers who depend on unsecured loans for the purchase of such items, they say. Margin pressure, which was visible in the March quarter earnings, is expected to persist in the June and September quarters as well despite price hikes undertaken by these companies. Though raw material prices have cooled a bit in the past few weeks, a bigger correction is needed to sustain the margin, analysts say. The Reserve Bank of India has raised the policy repo rate by 90 basis points since May to stave off persistently high inflation which hit an 18-month high in April. ""Despite recent corrections, commodity prices still remain elevated. There is a fear of US recession which has impacted investor sentiment on all consumption items globally including India. “On the other hand, higher crude prices and currency depreciation has been adding cost inflation for all the manufacturers, impacting the bottom line of the companies directly"" Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities, said. Recent reports of large price hikes by consumer firms to offset the surge in commodity inflation will likely reduce demand, experts say. ""The companies are examining the situation and will undertake calibrated price hikes to mitigate the inflationary pressure, which is expected to impact the overall demand in an already sluggish scenario"" said Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities. Chandan Taparia, Vice President, Equity Derivatives and Technical, Broking & Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, expects the consumer durables index likely to correct 5-7 percent more, given the recent price pattern and weak chart setup. ""Inflation has peaked and demand-pull back will cause inflation to soften. However, with the expectation of good monsoon and consequent rural recovery, we expect consumer demand to pick up with a quarter's lag"", Bolinjkar said."

3,"US energy traders counter Biden, say fuel hike did not materialise overnight, won't be solved fast",economy," US-based oil and gas trade groups have dismissed President Joe Biden’s criticism that the refiners were not supplying more fuel to make windfall profits, citing that the current problem is a result of many factors, including geopolitical developments like the Russian invasion of Ukraine and domestic issues like policy decisions of the government. As petrol prices skyrocketed in the US on June 14, Biden pulled up oil companies to boost supply and criticised them for making ""unacceptable"" high profit margins at a time when citizens were grappling with record-high prices. “Today’s situation did not materialise overnight and will not be quickly solved,” American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers and American Petroleum Institute said in a joint statement. The trade groups said that while the Russian invasion is undoubtedly exacerbating the situation, the current challenges are largely the result of high crude prices due to a supply-demand imbalance, logistics reshuffling as the world emerges from the pandemic, strong consumer demand, ban on Russian products, and policy decisions made at the federal and state levels over many years and by successive administrations. According to reports, the US Energy Department is likely to meet the oil industry executives this week to discuss high gas prices. Refining margins, the amount that refiners earn for turning every barrel of crude oil into refined products, have soared globally on the back of increasing demand for refined products. This has benefitted refiners who process raw crude into refined products and led to unusually high profits. Last month, the UK announced it will levy a windfall tax on oil and gas firms on the huge profits they are making during the energy crisis with hopes to raise £5 billion that could help the government to reduce household bills. The government in the UK has faced pushback from energy majors who have threatened to scale down investments. There have been speculations that other countries, like India, may also follow suit. But ONGC Chairperson and Managing Director Alka Mittal said in May that the government is not looking to impose any new tax on windfall gains. “With a global energy crunch underway, much focus has been placed on crude oil supply and demand. Yet crude oil has no utilitarian value until it runs through a refinery and gets processed into fuels like wholesale gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Because of this, it is not an overstatement to say that energy security requires a strong refining sector,” the US trade bodies said in the report. The letter highlighted that the refined products from crude are globally traded commodities, priced in a competitive global market. “Refined product prices are set by the marginal supply costs of bringing the incremental barrels of products to market. US refiners have been operating at historically high utilization rates and producing about as much product as they have over the past five years. Particularly on the East Coast, which has lost 70 percent of its pre-2009 refining capacity, incremental supplies have historically been imported from international markets to supplement domestic manufacturing. However, the cost of refining in other nations is currently higher,” the letter said. The trade bodies said that US refineries are operating at or near maximum utilisation, many facilities have safely delayed projects and maintenance so as to not take production offline and instead continue to provide supplies and build inventories. About half of US refinery shutdowns are conversions to renewable fuel production, the letter said. They said that even if refiners could bring more refining capacity online despite these challenges, the result could be higher demand and higher costs for crude oil. “Refiners do not make multi-billion-dollar investments based on short-term returns. They look at long-term supply and demand fundamentals and make investments as appropriate,” the traders said."
4,India's Russian coal purchases spike despite sanctions,economy," India's purchases of Russian coal have spiked in recent weeks despite global sanctions on Moscow, as traders offer discounts of up to 30%, according to two trade sources and data reviewed by Reuters. Russia, facing severe Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine, warned the European Union in April against sweeping sanctions on coal, saying they would backfire as the fuel would be redirected to other markets. India has refrained from condemning Russia, with which it has longstanding political and security ties, while calling for an end to violence in Ukraine. New Delhi defends its purchases of Russian goods as part of an effort to diversify supplies and argues a sudden halt would jack up world prices and hurt its consumers. U.S. officials have told India there is no ban on energy imports from Russia but they do not want to see a ""rapid acceleration"". Yet as European importers shun trade with Moscow, Indian buyers are lapping up huge quantities of Russian coal despite high freight costs. Its purchases of coal and related products jumped more than six-fold in the 20 days through Wednesday from the same period a year earlier to $331.17 million, according to unpublished Indian government data reviewed by Reuters. Indian refiners similarly have snapped up cheap Russian oil shunned by Western countries. The value of India's oil trade with Russia in the 20 days through Wednesday jumped more than 31-fold to $2.22 billion, the data showed. India's trade ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. ""The Russian traders have been liberal with payment routes and are accepting payments in Indian rupee and United Arab Emirates dirham,"" one source said. ""The discounts are attractive, and this trend of higher Russian coal purchases will continue."" COAL BUYING TO CONTINUE Offshore units of such Russian coal traders as Suek AG, KTK and Cyprus-based Carbo One in places including Dubai and Singapore offered discounts of 25% to 30%, triggering bulk purchases of Russian thermal coal by traders supplying to utilities and cement makers, the sources said. The second source said the Singapore-based unit of Suek was also accepting payments in dollars. Suek and KTK did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not immediately reach Carbo One. The EU ban has barred new coal contracts and by mid-August will force members nations to terminate existing ones. India bought an average $16.55 million of Russian coal a day in the three weeks through Wednesday, more than double the $7.71 million it bought in the three months after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, according to Reuters calculations. Oil purchases averaged $110.86 million a day in the 20-day period, more than triple the $31.16 million it spent in the three months ended May 26. Indian bulk buying of Russian coal is set to continue, with June imports expected to be the most in at least seven and a half years, Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data showed. Bulk shipments of Russian thermal coal started reaching India in the third week of May, with orders mainly from cement and steel firms and traders, according to shipping data compiled by an Indian coal trader."

The delegates set themselves a task to deliver several agreements on critical issues affecting global well- being, but initially could not do so. Then in despair they extended the closure to be able to negotiate through day and night in talks in airless ‘green’ rooms that at times bristled with anger and accusation, and eventually came up with agreements two days after..."

A three-year high credit growth, lower credit costs and rate hikes that portend an increase in margins have created a sweet spot for banks. That explains why earnings per share estimates have been hiked for banks.

7,"India’s trading partners—US, China account for a fifth of merchandise trade",economy," India’s foreign trade in merchandise goods rose sharply in 2021-22 with exports growing 44.6 percent and imports by 55.3 percent. The total value of merchandise trade crossed the $1 trillion mark for the first time as exports rose to $422 billion and imports to $613 billion. Trade grew even though it was beset with multiple challenges including broken supply chains, shortage of containers and delays at ports. The rise in trade, with imports outpacing exports, also led to a deterioration in India’s trade balance. The trade deficit climbed, inching past the 2012-13 peak by a tiny margin. The deterioration in the trade balance in that year was led by a jump in petroleum crude and gold imports bills. In FY 2022, the growth in exports and imports was led by a sharp rise in commodity prices as demand shot up when economies emerged after months of lockdown. Here we look at trade data for 2021-22 published by the commerce ministry to visualise the flow of India’s imports and exports for key trade partners.  India’s favoured trade partners India exports to 240 nations and jurisdictions and imports from 229. But trade flows with the US and China are the most significant. Over a fifth of India’s external merchandise trade in 2021-22 was with the US and China. The US wrestled back the top slot that it had lost to China the previous year, but the difference was just about $4 billion. India’s export to the US and imports from there grew about 50 percent from a year ago, while imports from China grew about 45 percent, notwithstanding some anti-China sentiments. Exports to China stayed flat. Among the top trading partners, bilateral trade in goods with Australia experienced the sharpest growth, both exports and imports doubled during the year. Yet, Australia accounts for just 2.4 percent of the value of goods traded between the two countries. India’s imports from oil-exporting countries also reported a sharp jump due to the elevated prices of crude petroleum. Imports from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and Iraq more than doubled, while those from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar climbed nearly 70 percent.  Jump in the trade deficit India's trade deficit jumped about 85.8 percent to $190 billion in 2021-22. The largest trade deficit was with China, estimated at $72.9 billion. That was equivalent to 40 percent of the trade deficit for the year. India's imports from China include electronic components, computer hardware, telecom instrument (mostly mobile phones), organic and other chemicals and machinery. The trade deficit with six oil-exporting countries—Iraq, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman—was equivalent to half of the total deficit. Is the rising trade deficit worrisome?"
8,"India fully protected interests of farmers, fishermen at WTO meet: Piyush Goyal",economy," India has completely protected the interests of farmers and fishermen in the recently concluded ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said on Sunday. Goyal, who led the Indian delegation for the WTO talks, also said that the decisions taken in the conference will further strengthen the role of the multi-lateral body in promoting global trade and India championed the cause of the developing and under-developed countries. Members of the Geneva-based WTO on June 17 secured a 'Geneva Package' which included agreements on curbing harmful fishing subsidies and temporary patent waiver for production of COVID-19 vaccines. The four-day talks of the 164-member body, which started on June 12, ended on June 17 after hectic negotiations. ""In the WTO ministerial conference, we fully protected the interests of farmers, MSMEs, and fishermen. There will be no burden on them. We protected their interests,"" the minister said here at an event where Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation the main tunnel and five underpasses of Pragati Maidan Integrated Transit Corridor Project. The Integrated Transit Corridor project is an integral part of Pragati Maidan Redevelopment Project. ""Checks are being placed on illegal fishing in the high seas and our fishermen will have full freedom in our EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zones). Similarly, we have ensured the MSP (Minimum Support Price) stays and our farmers interests have been protected,"" he said. Developed countries engaged in distant water fishing would not be able to provide subsidies for illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities, he added. Further, the MSP operations for farmers are also protected and ""farmers will not have any problem,"" he said. The WTO formulates rules for global exports and imports and adjudicates disputes between two or more than two nations. As per its rules, all decisions are taken by consensus and a single member nation can veto a decision. Talking about the Pragati Maidan Integrated Transit Corridor Project, Goyal said it would help in decongesting traffic at Bhairon Marg here near India Gate. He said the tunnel is part of the redevelopment plan of ITPO site at Pragati Maidan and this state-of-the-art convention and exhibition centre will be ready in time for India's presidency of the G20 Summit in December next year. Lamenting the Delhi government's callous attitude towards the Pragati Maidan corridor, Goyal said unfortunately the state government ignored repeated reminders to fulfill its share of just 20 per cent cost of the project. ""When the state government showed complete alacrity, PM Modi declared that the central government will bear the entire cost of the project,"" he said."
9,"Selling diesel at Rs 20-25/litre loss, petrol at Rs 14-18/litre below cost: Private retailers",economy," Selling diesel at Rs 20-25 a litre below cost and petrol at Rs 14-18 per litre below cost, as a result of a price freeze despite soaring crude rates is unsustainable, an industry body representing private fuel retailers like Jio-bp and Nayara Energy has told the Oil Ministry and has sought its intervention to create a viable investment environment. On June 10, the Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry (FIPI), which besides private fuel retailers also counts state-owned firms such as IOC, BPCL and HPCL as its members, wrote to the Petroleum Ministry saying losses on petrol and diesel will limit further investments in retailing business. International crude oil and product prices have risen sharply to a decade high but state-owned fuel retailers, who control 90 per cent of the market, have frozen petrol and diesel prices at rates equivalent to two-third of the cost. This has left private fuel retailers like Jio-bp, Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy and Shell to either raise prices and lose customers, or to curtail sales to cut losses. Retail selling prices for petrol and diesel were held for a record 137 days between early November 2021 and March 21, 2022 despite soaring prices. ""With effect from March 22, 2022, the retail selling prices were revised on 14 occasions at an average of 80 paise per litre per day, leading to an overall increase of Rs 10 per litre on both petrol and diesel. ""However, the under-recoveries (losses) continue to be very high in a range of Rs 20-25 per litre for diesel and Rs 14-18 per litre for petrol,"" FIPI director general Gurmeet Singh wrote. While retail rates have been on a freeze since April 6, the price of diesel sold to bulk users like state transport undertakings increased in line with the rise in international oil prices. Petrol & Diesel Rates Yesterday Wednesday, 22nd June, 2022 Petrol Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Wednesday, 22nd June, 2022 Diesel Rate in Mumbai Yesterday ""This resulted in rapid diversion of bulk diesel (direct consumers) sales to retail outlets amounting to widening of losses incurred by private fuel retailing companies,"" FIPI wrote. ""We urgently seek your support in matters related to retail selling pricing of petrol and diesel, as all private oil marketing companies, who are making investments in the retailing sector are experiencing a difficult investment environment,"" it said. Losses, it said, will limit their ability to ""make further investments as well as to operate and expand their networks."" ""The stakeholders of private fuel retailing companies, namely dealers (including prospective dealers), transporters, direct and indirect employees and end-consumers also inadvertently bear the impact of under-recoveries,"" Singh wrote. FIPI sought the ministry's intervention to provide some relief to fuel retailers, create a more viable investment environment for private fuel retailers and support development of the right environment and ecosystem to attract further investments and job creation in the sector. ""The continuing uncertainty around the oil and gas sector and delay in equitable policy implementation like following free market determined pricing principles, providing access to infrastructure and bringing oil and gas under GST could potentially discourage foreign investors to make investments,"" it said. ""With no triggers for reduction in prevailing crude and product cracks, the under-recovery situation shall only aggravate for the fuel retailing companies."" Higher prices at private company outlets and some of them curtailing sales had in recent days led to heavy traffic at PSU petrol pumps, leading to some of them in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Gujarat running out of stock. To ensure private companies don't curtail operations, the government on June 17, expanded the scope of Universal Service Obligation (USO), mandating licensed entities to maintain petrol and diesel sales at all petrol pumps, including in remote areas, for specified working hours. ""The government has now expanded the horizon of USO by including all retail outlets (petrol pumps) including remote area ROs under their ambit,"" the oil ministry had said in a statement on Friday. After this, entities that have been granted licences to retail petrol and diesel will be ""obligated to extend the USO to all the retail consumers at all the retail outlets."" Failure to meet norms can lead to the cancellation of licences. The USOs include maintaining supplies of petrol and diesel throughout the specified working hours and of specified quality and quantity; making available minimum facilities as specified by the central government, the statement had said."
10,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender | When Jerome Powell sneezes…,economy," Dear Reader, Sentiment in the equity markets is at extreme lows. A Bank of America survey of global fund managers, carried out between the 3rd and 10th of this month, found that global growth optimism was at an all-time low, that fear of stagflation was the highest since the Global Financial Crisis, and their outlook on corporate profits the worst since the Lehman bust. Even before the Fed meeting, therefore, market sentiment was terrible, but a 75 basis point hike was already baked in, as was another 75 bps hike at the July meeting. With so much pessimism in the air, it was an ideal setting for a nice bear market rally. Yet the small rebound after Jay Powell’s press conference fizzled out in a day and the markets plunged again. What could be the reason? Yes, Powell was insistent that he was determined to stamp out inflation. But the markets already knew that. The market’s concern is whether the Fed will be forced to tighten too much to quell inflation and that could lead to a recession. What was new at Powell’s press conference? In reply to a crucial question by the FT reporter: “Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation it will require more than just some pain?” Powell said, “What's becoming more clear is that many factors that we don’t control are going to play a very significant role.” He then went on to talk about commodity prices, the war in Ukraine and supply-side bottlenecks. He also said, in reply to another question, that the Fed has to target headline inflation, because that is what shapes inflationary expectations, which are the drivers of inflation. But headline inflation and inflationary expectations are in large part determined by energy and food prices. That means the Fed may have to dampen demand until it can offset supply-side inflation, over which it has no control. It’s a very uncomfortable situation to be in. This FT article, free to read for Moneycontrol Pro subscribers, says shaping public perception may be beyond Jay Powell’s control. Interestingly, the RBI’s ‘State of the Economy Report’ echoes these concerns when it says, “Will these monetary policy actions exorcise the evil spirit of inflation? Who knows till when the war in Ukraine would last? But the RBI has to act.” Powell also said, in response to other questions: “It's not getting easier, it's getting more challenging”; “pathways have become much more challenging due to factors beyond our control”; “very difficult situation to be in”; “what you're seeing is the situation becoming more difficult” -- all of which indicate the Fed chair is far from confident. That lack of confidence is percolating down to the markets. In the Bank of America survey referred to above, 32 percent said “hawkish central banks” are the biggest tail risks to markets, followed by 25 percent who said it was “global recession”, while another 22 percent said it was inflation. Comparing the current situation with the 1970s is much in vogue these days and a research paper by Harvard professor Lawrence Summers finds that the disinflation the US has to achieve today is similar to that of the Volcker years, which means the markets will have to prepare for a long and bruising battle against inflation. Indeed, this piece argues that just as the turmoil of the 70s led to a turn towards free markets and free trade in the 1980s, the disruptions today will usher in a new economic paradigm. Be that as it may, note that financial conditions in the US are still not tight enough. My colleague Neha Dave points out that for the US markets, while valuations have corrected, that is usually a signal for earnings downgrades to follow. And let’s not forget that it’s not just the Fed Funds rate that is going up, central banks are also doing Quantitative Tightening. The RBI Bulletin’s State of the Economy report for this month says that as far as India is concerned, “The recovery remained broadly on track. This demonstrates the resilience of the economy in the face of multiple shocks and the innate strength of macro fundamentals as India strives to regain a sustainable high growth trajectory.” It added, “What the RBI is trying to do is to stabilise the price situation when the economy is able to bear it.” UBS India economist Tanvee Gupta Jain expects the repo rate to be 6.25 percent in FY23, compared to 4.9 percent now. This piece said inflation in Asia hasn’t yet peaked. For the Indian markets too, the RBI’s efforts to dampen demand and cost pressures are likely to lead to earnings downgrades, as my colleague Vatsala Kamat pointed out. While the valuation froth has diminished, further de-rating is possible due to demand destruction. The prospects for a revival of rural FMCG demand don’t look bright yet and our Economy Recovery Tracker shows consumer sentiment dipping. Then, of course, there are the constant FII outflows, and we examined why Indian retail investors are buying while FIIs are selling and why gold is refusing to act out its traditional safe haven role. This may be the time to cherry pick quality stocks and the ones we considered this week included City Union Bank, VA Tech Wabag, a market leader in refractories, Ujjivan SFB, Federal Bank and Sona BLW. We also looked at the prospects of the cement, retail and city gas distribution sectors. Hospitals and pharma companies such as Laurus Labs, of course, march to the tune of a different drummer. We had all our regular features—FX Learn on how to trade non-directional currency options; Crypto Conversations on why ERC-1155 is special; Start-up Street on why Fintech is back; Personal Finance on the reviving charms of fixed income and Monsoon Watch on the rains picking up speed. This week, we’ve re-started The Green Pivot, a special series to chronicle the impact of green technology and climate change. The Bank of America survey points out what is different about the lows in the market this time around. It says, “Normally at a ‘big low’, investors universally expect central banks to panic and cut rates… in 2022, the central bank panic is in the other direction, hiking rates to desperately reverse their excess stimulus of 2020 and 2021.” Manas Chakravarty"
11,India has been able to secure favourable outcome at WTO after many years: Goyal,economy," India has been able to secure a favorable outcome at the WTO after many years, despite a strong global campaign against Indian farmers and fishermen, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said here on Friday. He was briefing the media after the conclusion of the 12th ministerial conference — the highest decision-making body of the WTO (World Trade Organisation). Terming the conference as an ""outcome oriented"" success, Goyal said the Indian delegation, guided constantly by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been 100 per cent successful in portraying before the world the priority issues for India and the developing world. ""Few countries attempted to create a false campaign, initially on Sunday and Monday, that India is obstinate due to which no progress is being made. The real situation has emerged before us all, the issues raised by India, on which the Prime Minister had asked us to focus upon, now the whole world acknowledges that was the correct agenda and ultimately India played a vital role in arriving at all solutions,"" he added. He added that it turned the tide of negotiations from full failure, gloom and doom to optimism, enthusiasm and consensus based decision. India's efforts to bring members on a table to discuss issues irrespective of the existing geopolitical order has ensured that the world order is not broken, he said. ""Today as we return India there is no issue on which we have to be the least concerned, whether it is related to agriculture such as MSP, reinforcing the relevance of the public stockholding programme towards fulfilling the National Food Safety Programme or PM Garib Kalyan Scheme, TRIPS waiver, e-commerce moratorium, response to Covid and fisheries,"" the minister added. Further, he added that there have been no restrictions on fishing that would bind artisanal and traditional fishermen of India in the future. ""India has been cent per cent successful; no restrictions or terms have been placed on India or the government, rather we have been successful in introducing checks on illegal fishing, under-reporting or outside regulation,"" he said."
12,Fed's Powell: a U.S. digital dollar could help maintain international primacy,economy," The development of an official digital version of the U.S. dollar could help safeguard its global dominance as other countries issue their own, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Friday, weighing in with generally positive remarks on a hot-button topic at the central bank that has left policymakers divided. ""A U.S. CBDC (central bank digital currency) could... potentially help maintain the dollar's international standing,"" Powell said in introductory remarks to a research conference held by the central bank on the international roles of the dollar. ""A U.S. CBDC (central bank digital currency) could... potentially help maintain the dollar's international standing,"" Powell said in introductory remarks to a research conference held by the central bank on the international roles of the dollar. ""As we consider feedback...we will be thinking not just about the current state of the world, but also how the global financial system might evolve over the next 5 to 10 years,"" Powell added. Ten countries have already launched central bank digital currencies and another 105 countries are exploring the option, according to the Atlantic Council, leading to fears the dollar could lose some of its dominance to China. The dollar remains underpinned by key fundamentals, including a commitment to transparency, the rule of law and the full independence of the Fed, Powell noted. In addition, the Fed's commitment to its price stability mandate contributes to widespread confidence in the dollar as a store of value, Powell said.

13,"Yen tanks as BOJ sticks to stimulus, caps volatile week for FX",economy," The Japanese yen tumbled against the dollar on Friday after the Bank of Japan bucked a wave of tightening and stuck with its ultra-accommodative stance, adding to soaring volatility in currency markets hit by a series of rate hikes this week. Currency markets have been roiled by one of the biggest runs of monetary policy tightening in decades, including the Federal Reserve's mid-week three-quarters-of-a-percent rate increase, its biggest since 1995, and the Swiss National Bank's surprise decision to hike rates by 0.5%. Japan's central bank went against the current on Friday, keeping all of its policy settings unchanged and vowing to defend its bond yield cap of 0.25% with unlimited buying. The BOJ's move knocked the yen, which on Wednesday hit a 24-year low of 135.6 per dollar, broadly lower, last down 2.24% against the greenback at 135.105 yen, and 1.35% lower versus the euro. ""Today were seeing a rebalancing of the market. Its been a very volatile week,"" said Simon Harvey, head of FX analysis at Monex Europe. ""Markets are still adjusting to the central bank meetings from throughout the week."" The dollar rose off a one-week low against major peers, following a two-day slide after the Fed's mid-week rate increase of 0.75%, a move that was anticipated by markets as the Fed attempts to tame stubbornly high inflation. The dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six rivals, was up 1.069% to 104.99, putting it on track for a weekly rise of around 0.75%. U.S. Treasury yields held at lower levels on Friday after a volatile week that saw yields hit more than 10-year highs on expectations of aggressive rate hikes, and then fall on concerns about how these will impact growth. The Swiss National Bank's surprise decision to raise rates by 0.5% continued to reverberate through markets, with the euro losing half a percent and the franc heading back towards two-month highs hit immediately after Thursday's announcement. The euro was last down 0.91% at $1.0456 versus the dollar. Against the Swiss franc, the common currency was down 0.46% at 1.0148 francs per euro. The franc rocketed to a two-month high on Thursday after the rate hike and boosted by a sense among investors that the SNB would not try and stop a strengthening franc as it has in the past. Giving up earlier gains, the dollar lost 0.43% to 0.9656 francs, after tumbling the most in seven years overnight. ""The surprise rate hike in Switzerland, as well as the European Central Bank's announcement that it is working on a tool to prevent the fragmentation of the European bond markets, will help to limit USD strength around current levels,"" strategists at UBS's Global Wealth Managements Chief Investment Office said in a research note. Sterling dropped 1.37% to $1.2182, giving back nearly all of its overnight gains from when the Bank of England decided to lift rates again, albeit by less than many in the market had expected, along with a hawkish signal about future policy action. Currency markets are also having to contend with a massive drop in risk sentiment that has sent equity markets tumbling. The Australian dollar, which is very sensitive to the broad global investment mood, fell 1.87% to just under $0.6914 after stock markets in Asia tumbled and Wall Street was mixed following a steep selloff on Thursday."
14,"Oil drops on recession concerns, heading for weekly fall",economy," Oil prices fell almost 2% on Friday and were on track for a weekly decline as interest rate hikes from major central banks fuelled worries about a sharp economic slowdown. Brent crude was down $2.19, or 1.8%, at $117.62 a barrel at 1334 GMT, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $2.56, or 2.2%, to $115.03. Brent was on track for its first weekly dip in five weeks, and U.S. crude for its first decline in eight weeks, in line with a fall in equity markets amid fears of a possible recession as several central banks delivered big rate hikes. ""The influence of the macro environment has started to take over from oil specific fundamentals in recent days,"" said Investec's head of commodities Callum Macpherson. ""Consistent with the broader market pre-occupation with rates and inflation, the oil market narrative may now turn to focus more on affordability, rather than on supply."" Both contracts had risen by more than $1 earlier in the session as U.S. sanctions on Chinese and Emirati companies and on a network of Iranian firms that help export Iran's petrochemicals lent some support to oil prices. The U.S. government said while it is pursing diplomacy to revive a nuclear deal with Iran, it will continue to use sanctions to limit exports of oil, oil products, and petrochemicals from Iran. Analysts estimate that a deal and the consequent lifting of sanctions on Iran's energy sector could add up to 1 million barrels of oil per day to global markets. ""The market has been watching negotiations between the West and Iran in anticipation of a revival of the nuclear deal in recent months. This brought back into focus the ongoing supply side issues in the market,"" ANZ Research analysts said in a note. The global oil market continues to show signs of ""turbulence"", Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Friday, blaming the uncertainties over oil production recovery in Libya, Iran and Venezuela and a lack of energy infrastructure."
15,Improvement in capacity utilisation a clear sign of natural growth in economy: SBI chairman,economy," State Bank of India chairman Dinesh Khara on Friday said the improvement in capacity utilisation to 74 per cent from 69 per cent shows that the economy is geared for its natural growth. He said among the large nations across the globe, India is one of the most stable economies in the current situation. ""The way the capacity utilisation in the economy has improved from 69 per cent to 74 per cent, and is inching upwards, it is a clear sign that the economy is poised for its natural growth,"" Khara said at a banking event organised at the Financial Express newspaper. He said the country has handled the pandemic in the best possible manner and the economy is performing pretty well. Talking about the credit demand, Khara said retail and corporate sectors are both witnessing the momentum. ""I would say it (credit demand) is universal. Our retail book continues to grow at more than 16 per cent per annum. This has been the trend for more than 4-5 years. ""On the corporate side, there was a time when corporates were raising money from the market also but now gradually they are moving towards banks for availing CP (Commercial Paper) funding. So that also is a new engine of growth,"" Khara said. Speaking at the event, Standard Chartered CEO Zarin Daruwala said over the last four-five months, there has been an increase in demand for working capital loans owing to a surge in commodity prices."

Domestic passenger traffic is estimated to be moving closer to the pre-pandemic levels and airlines have seen a significant improvement in utilisation levels. However, just as normalcy is returning, the industry is facing new headwinds. Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices have hit a new high this week, more than doubling from a year ago. While this is steeply raising operating costs, the depreciation of the Indian rupee is making matters worse. A large part (around 70 percent) of the airlines costs are dollar denominated and airlines will be hard pressed to fully recoup rising costs. Airlines have been raising ticket prices. But the recent surge in input costs warrant large price hikes, which some fear could hit demand. “Despite taking a significant price increase, airlines may be required to take further hikes to offset the surge in ATF price, possibly reaching a point of demand elasticity in travel industry,” warn analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities. Competition may also act as a limiting factor for price hikes. The Tata group is consolidating its investments in airlines and is eyeing a bigger role in the sector. Akasa Air is set launch its operations and Jet Airways is preparing to resume flying. Even if airlines refrain from price wars, investors would do well to monitor crude prices. The oil market is precariously placed currently. With Europe restricting its purchases of Russian crude, the global market is currently under-supplied in crude oil, Vandana Hari, an expert on energy markets, said in an IIFL Securities webinar. Any reduction in supplies hereon can further drive up crude oil prices. That is a major risk India faces right now. High commodity prices can keep inflation elevated amid slow economic growth, Tanvee Gupta Jain, India economist at UBS India tells in an interview with Vatsala Kamat. “The moment global commodity prices goes up, it starts hurting India's GDP growth and leads to widening current account deficit,” warns Jain.

20,Rupee settles flat at 78.09 against US dollar,economy," The rupee pared initial gains to settle just 1 paisa higher at 78.09 (provisional) against the US dollar on Friday amid a muted trend in domestic equities and unabated foreign capital outflows. A strong dollar overseas and higher crude prices also kept the domestic unit under pressure, forex dealers said. At the interbank forex market, the rupee opened strong at 78.03 against the greenback and witnessed an intra-day high of 78.02 and a low of 78.09. It finally ended at 78.09, registering a gain of 1 paisa over its previous close of 78.10. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, climbed 0.71 per cent to 104.37. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, spurted 0.96 per cent to USD 120.96 per barrel."
21,"Easing Tariffs | From Joe Biden, To China, without love",economy," At this year’s correspondent’s dinner, South African comedian Trevor Noah quipped that United States President Joe Biden’s critics had unnecessarily excoriated the President. He said things were finally looking up, such as “rent is up, food is up, and gas is up”, cheekily taking a dig at the President on inflation. My father always jested that inflation always beats interest, and now that’s the theme in Washington, as the US Federal Reserve raised short term rates by 0.75 percentage point. Earlier this week, US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the goal was to avoid a recession through this calculated interest rate hikes have been the US Fed's biggest in a single meeting since 1994. In an earlier article, I’d mentioned, “not since Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), who took the reins in the midst of the Great Depression, has an American President entered the hallowed walls under such trying circumstances of an economic quandary and healthcare morass”. Biden’s priorities were always going to be a complicated cocktail of two conundrums. The domestic focus would be theCOVID-19 induced healthcare crisis and rolling out the vaccine for millions in the US, a supply chain recovery, and the subsequent economic downtown. On the international front, restoring US’ outreach to transatlantic partners, re-prioritising NATO in the wake of Russian aggression, and re-prioritising trade and multilateralism through initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Front, the Indo-Pacific Quad, the Middle East Quad, the JCPOA with Iran, re-visiting the Paris climate deal, and re-joining the World Health Organization — the last three of which, Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump walked away from. On China, in an earlier article I’d noted that Biden would follow a policy of ‘small yard, high fence’. This essentially described that Biden would not embrace Trump’s bellicosity of starting trade wars, and that there would be room for economic engagement, but with severe caveats of security vis-à-vis Chinese companies such as ByteDance and Huawei. Biden now faces pressure to tame inflation, as news of an impending recession dominates headlines. The continuing pandemic variants, coupled with supply chain disruption and soaring gas (fuel) prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has hit US households. It’s political music to the more fiscally conservative GOP, as Republican lawmakers look to drive the wedge deeper, as both Democrats and Republicans go to the polls ahead of the November mid-term race. An escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington during the Trump administration affected global sentiment, including trade dependent economic hubs such as Singapore, caught between two-warring economic elephants, and dependent on both. Biden says he is considering easing previously imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, which is a move that could ease economic tensions between the two largest economies. He said what his former boss would often say, that ‘all options are on the table’ as the administration reviews potential changes with regards to US duties on Chinese imports, including tariff relief and new trade investigations. This comes with caveats of reviewing China’s previous issues with fair-trade practices, and precluding economic coercion, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, an area sacrosanct to Washington with the focus on IPEF and the Quad. The focus isn’t a complete reset of economic ties between Washington and Beijing, but heavily geared towards taming a beast called inflation, and easing the stranglehold on rising consumer prices. Easing the Trump era tariffs of up to 25 percent on hundreds of billions of dollars on Chinese imports will be welcome news for trade associations, which say, has affected the bottom-line for several US. Within the administration are two competing viewpoints. Former US Fed Chairperson and current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has espoused easing tariff controls in order to aggravate the pain of rising prices at home. Meanwhile, trade tsar US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai, for whom trade comes under her office’s purview, is currently reluctant, citing the need for a more comprehensive China strategy on trade before any knee-jerk reaction. For both Tai and Yellen, the focus is US jobs, however, for the USTR, China's trade practices are a major cause of concern. The Yellen camp believes that some of the tariffs are unnecessary and incidentally hurt the US consumer, and eradicating them would be the best way to curb inflation. The USTR’s office believes in lieu of a more focused China strategy, Beijing will continue to manipulate the market with unfair trade practices and devaluing the Yuan to gain the upper hand in the trade arena. Tariffs on China were initially imposed for fear of patent infringements via technology transfers and intellectual property violations. The trepidation for the Tai camp and trade watchers, is that those will persist if Beijing is given a longer leash. On the other hand, removal of barriers for other goods such as t-shirts, bicycles, toys, (which China is the largest exporter of), will help the consumer in the US. Some say easing tariffs on China for inflationary concerns would be missing the woods for the trees. Similar to Biden’s outreach to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia for additional energy resources in the market, both with egregious human rights violations, in order to economically isolate Russia. For Biden, it’s a damned if you do, damned if you don’t. The 79-year-old US President fights a low approval rating, as Biden’s party heads to the midterms. Rising costs will be the main item for voters, while China hawks and the Republicans will accuse the President of going too soft on Beijing, that is, if there will be any allowance on this front.

22,Inflation pipelines swelling as a long period of global macro instability begins,economy," As CPI inflation fell to 7 percent in May, some views have emerged it may have peaked in April at 7.8 percent. This is consistent with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s quarterly inflation projection of June 8. One needs to be careful these days though. The credibility of central banks the world over is under scrutiny. One needs to look no further than the United States, where a large number of analysts had converged to the opinion that US inflation had peaked after it eased in April. Instead, the US’ annual inflation rate reversed in May, jolting expectations as had happened last October. It was really brave for the RBI to have ignored the significant amount of inflation stuffed inside the wholesale prices, which have been accelerating over a much stronger base. Only time will tell how much of that will be passed on to the retail buyers. Consider the swelling pipelines of inflation. The first is wholesale price increases — those in the past that are yet to be passed on, and fresher additions each month. Strong corporate profits do not escape notice; neither does the regular revision of selling prices to consumers. Apart from the manufacturing goods’ burden, there’s the waiting passthrough of higher energy and electricity costs that many analysts have flagged; this includes a widening gap in retail and crude oil import prices, costlier coal imports, and electricity. Services’ inflation is waiting to catch-up more than it has. Food inflation isn’t entirely dependent upon monsoons either; wholesale prices grew into double-digits, 10.9 percent, last month, jumping two points over April. The other pipeline to domestic inflation that is not imminently apparent is the exchange rate channel. The rupee will increasingly bear the fallout of expected as well as unforeseen changes in overseas monetary and financial conditions. The most obvious is US monetary tightening, where the main reference rate was hiked by 75-bps this week with strong indications of another 50-points next month and the sureness of a recession. Additional tightening source is the US Fed’s balance sheet reduction or quantitative tightening (QT) that is estimated to remove approximately $95 billion per month according to a Financial Times report. Historically, the re-pricing of rates has been volatile, with currencies bearing the brunt of adjustment. This time, the new and unknown feature in a potent cocktail of high inflation and interest rates with slowing growth is the unprecedented level of debt stock in developed and emerging economies, bigger in the last. Another steady build-up of rupee pressure is the widening trade deficit, a growing risk. We must note that this is only the beginning of a long period of macroeconomic instability. The US tightening cycle has just commenced. It has a long way to go. The RBI is no doubt mindful of all this. But it may be overoptimistic in keeping real rates negative. Inflation is entrenching globally. This is because of non-action and delay by central banks who allowed it to persist, embed into expectations and into their economies. In this context, the RBI’s sanguineness on inflation suggests that it considers India is an exception to this trend. This is simply unlikely. Globally, central banks, particularly the US Fed, are being accused of negligence and poor judgement, leading to policy error that is now galvanising them into faster, steeper rate hikes to ‘catch-up’, and regain credibility. They are doubly charged with causing economic harm of severe proportions, which could range from losses and balance sheet damages to households, firms, and investors to straining debt-laden governments, and possible debt defaults. Of course, sending the world economy into a recession. India cannot be insulated from these forceful readjustments. The notion that inflation is supply-driven needs re-examination. That demand factors have increasingly taken over requires consideration, e.g., the regular retail price revisions by profitable firms in the context of a K-shaped recovery creates grounds for rethinking, especially because of the inflationary squeeze to real disposable incomes of vulnerable low-income groups belonging to the lower stroke. Negative real rates need correction. Renu Kohli is a New Delhi-based macroeconomist. Views are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication."
23,Govt includes fuel retail outlets in remote areas under Universal Service Obligation to ensure uninterrupted supply,economy," The Union government has expanded the scope of Universal Service Obligation (USO) to cover fuel retail outlets (ROs) in remote areas to ensure quality and uninterrupted fuel supply services to the consumers, according to an official statement on June 17. The move comes after petrol pump dealers across the country wrote to the petroleum ministry about supply constraints from Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs), which had led to several pumps running dry, especially in remote areas, especially in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka. The USO will make it obligatory for OMCs to provide supply to retail pumps across the country for the benefit of the end-customers. “Now the authorized entities have been obligated to extend the USO to all the retail consumers at all the retail outlets. This has been done with an objective to ensure higher level of customer services in the market and to ensure that adherence to the USO forms a part of the market discipline,” the statement said. These USO will include, that the oil marketing companies maintain supplies of petrol and diesel throughout the specified working hours and of specified quality and quantity, make available minimum facilities as specified by the central government, maintain minimum inventory levels of fuel as specified by the Centre, from time to time, provide services to any person on demand within a reasonable period of time and  that they do not-discriminate on the basis and  ensuring availability of fuel to the customers at reasonable prices. Public sector fuel retailers– Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), have not increased the retail price of petrol and diesel in line with the steep increase in crude oil prices. They typically revise retail petrol and diesel prices daily, based on the rolling average of international benchmark prices over the past 15 days. While they increased prices of fuel sold to bulk consumers and aviation turbine fuel in line with the sharp rise in crude oil prices, retail prices of petrol and diesel were left unchanged for almost 137 days until March 22. Even though the prices have been revised since March 22, the OMCs are still making losses on retail sales of fuel.

24,Govt committed to make sure capital expenditure continues to support growth momentum: CEA,economy," The government is committed to ensure that capital expenditure will continue to support the economic growth momentum regained after the third COVID-19 wave, Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran said on Friday. The government has taken various steps — including lowering taxes, the continuation of privatisation, setting up institutions for sequestering bad loans and managing them and launching an asset monetisation drive — to strengthen the real economy. ""Given the ongoing sense of uncertainty among the private sector participants, both in banking and the non-banking world, the government is committed to making sure that capital expenditure continues (in) such (a way) that growth impulse that we have regained after the third wave is not surrendered,"" Nageswaran said while speaking at a banking event organised by Financial Express. In the previous fiscal, while the capital expenditure was budgeted at Rs 6 lakh crore, the government managed to spend Rs 5.92 lakh crore. ""And hence, for the current financial year, if the government is able to execute the capital expenditure of Rs 7.5 lakh crore, then that is the biggest real economic intervention,"" he said. Speaking about the banking industry, he said the sector has a very important role to play in sustaining the current growth scenario and turning the country's relative advantage today into a source of absolute growth advantage over other nations."

1,Spectacular success for India at WTO ministerial conference: Piyush Goyal,economy," Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on June 17  said that India has achieved spectacular success at World Trade Organization (WTO)'s ministerial conference (MC12) in Geneva, Switzerland. Goyal had led India's delegation to the four-day global summit which was extended for two additional days after differences among member nations on key issues, led to intense negotiations. ""India is 100% satisfied with the outcome of WTO's MC12 conference. India was successful in ensuring the livelihood of its farmers and fishermen,"" Goyal said. He further added that India was successful in convincing all nations to ensure a patent waiver for the manufacturing of Covid vaccines. Goyal was speaking to the press after the once-in-two-year mega meeting of trade ministers from all 162 WTO member nations concluded in the early hours of Friday. MC12 finally ended with deals on a global intellectual property rights (IPR) waiver for Covid vaccines and fishing subsidies to protect ocean resources. Moneycontrol had reported on Thursday that both deals were expected to finally pass despite intense debate. While India had pushed for more comprehensive measures in these areas, as well as for talks on agriculture, the final outcome has been backed by New Delhi as promising. ""Everyone had written off this conference as a failed endeavour when it had begun. There had no decision, not even an outcome document at WTO since 2015. There were a lot of arguments against multilateralism and that globalization has no promise. This conference has reestablished the position of multilateral institutions by deciding on issues which were pending for decades,"" Goyal stressed. Big wins ""The agreement on fisheries is currently limited to illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing. The discussion on extending this to all government subsidies will take place going forward. Currently, there are no restrictions on government subsidies,"" Goyal said. Instead, the WTO has cognizance of India's demand that nations that have consistently supported illegal deepsea fishing be regulated, he added. Goyal also said that there is no negative outcome for India's agriculture sector. India's public stockholding program for foodgrains will also continue unhindered, he added. On the issue of food security, Goyal said talks have progressed to a certain degree. A proposed global declaration to not curb foodgrain exports to the World Food Programme (WFP), which seeks to fight hunger in places hit by conflicts, disasters, and climate change, passed in a modified form after being blocked by India. Reduced scope ""The WTO has also decided to craft a significant response to the pandemic,"" Goyal said referring to the patent waiver for Covid vaccines. MC12 has also finally approved a temporary suspension of certain parts of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Suspending parts of the TRIPS agreement would allow countries to overcome the legal challenges posed by patents to ensure the timely provisioning of affordable medical products. However, the deal will only to cover vaccines and not related items. While India had consistently pushed for keeping all therapeutics and diagnostic technologies part of the deal, the final deal will help developing and poor nations to access much needed vaccines Goyal said. ""The WTO has approved the solution that came out of consistent discussions between India, South Africa, United States and European Union on the issue,"" he said. Going forward The WTO has also decided to extend yet again the moratorium on taxation on e-commerce transactions. The WTO members had agreed to not impose customs duties on electronic transmissions since 1998 and the moratorium has been periodically extended at successive ministerial conferences. However, India has increasingly become a strict opponent of the move and initially blocked the continuation of the moratorium at MC12. New Delhi had stressed that it is willing to tax electronic transactions in the near future, using Section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act. It also wants to retain the policy space to grant preferential treatment of digital products created within India. ""The moratorium was extended but with a deadline. It was decided that there has to be clarity on this issue by March 2024,"" Goyal argued. The next ministerial conference (MC13) is set to be held then."

3,RBI turns net buyer of US currency in April; buys $1.965 Billion,economy," The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) turned net purchaser of the US currency in April, after it bought USD 1.965 billion from spot market, according to RBI's monthly bulletin for June. In the reporting month, RBI bought USD 11.965 billion and sold USD 10 billion in the spot market, the bulletin released on Thursday showed. In March 2022, RBI had net sold USD 20.101 billion. It had purchased USD 4.315 billion and sold USD 24.416 billion in the spot market, the data showed. During the fiscal 2022, the central bank had net purchased USD 17.312 billion. It had bought USD 113.991 billion and sold USD 96.679 billion in the spot market in FY22. In the forward dollar market, the outstanding net purchase at the end of April 2022 was USD 63.826 billion, compared to a purchase of USD 65.791 billion in March 2022, the data showed. Meanwhile rupee recovered from its record low to close 12 paise higher at 78.10 against the American currency today, tracking the overnight weakness of the dollar and falling crude oil prices. The dollar index fell from its elevated levels after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points in a historic move to fight inflation and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come, traders said. At the interbank forex market, the rupee opened at 78.06 against the greenback and moved in a narrow range of 78 to 78.12. It finally ended at 78.10, higher by 12 paise over its previous close. On Wednesday, the rupee had plunged 18 paise to close at its fresh lifetime low of 78.22. The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.13 per cent to 105.02. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, slipped 0.25 per cent to USD 118.21 per barrel. ""Even after higher trade deficit numbers, weaker regional currencies and risk-averse sentiments, the rupee got support from the fall in crude oil prices,"" said Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities. India's merchandise exports in May rose by 20.55 per cent to USD 38.94 billion, while the trade deficit ballooned to a record USD 24.29 billion, according to the government data released on Wednesday."
4,"India's 'natural' interest rate has fallen to 0.8-1% from 1.6-1.8%, say RBI staff",economy," India's 'natural' rate of interest is estimated to have fallen by nearly a full percentage point in the last seven years, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) staff. In an article released on June 16, the RBI staff said their analysis showed India's potential output growth had slowed down since 2014. ""Correspondingly, the natural rate is estimated to have declined to 1 percent, with a higher confidence band to reflect the impact of post-COVID volatility in key determinants of the natural rate,"" the article said. The article is written by Sitikantha Pattanaik, Harendra Kumar Behera, and Saurabh Sharma of the RBI's Department of Economic and Policy Research. The views expressed in the article are not those of the central bank. Like the real interest rate, the natural rate of interest is an abstract and unobservable concept and must be derived from other data. It is then used to assess the stance of monetary policy. If the natural rate of interest is lower than the inflation-adjusted policy rate, monetary policy is said to be anti-inflationary or contractionary. If it is higher than the inflation-adjusted policy rate, monetary policy is said to be accommodative. ""When the real policy rate is at or close to the natural rate, monetary policy is neutral, i.e., neither expansionary nor contractionary. This situation is expected to prevail when inflation is aligned to the target and output is at or close to its potential level,"" the article said. As per the article, India's natural interest rate was 0.8-1 percent for the last quarter of 2021, 80 basis points lower than 1.6-1.8 percent estimated for the first quarter of 2015. ""Pandemic-induced factors have likely altered natural rate of interest which is sensitive to the choice of methodology and variables used, warranting careful interpretation within the assessment of the monetary policy stance,"" the article added. Currently, the real policy rate is deeply negative, with headline retail inflation above 7 percent and the repo rate only recently increased to 4.9 percent. As such, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. Meanwhile, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said in its statement on June 8 that it had decided to ""remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth"". According to the article, both advanced and emerging economies have seen a fall in their natural interest rates in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, as per estimates."
5,RBI Bulletin: Forex reserves the only reliable cushion against global volatility,economy," A sturdy pile of foreign exchange reserves is the only reliable tool for an emerging market economy such as India to safeguard itself from the adverse effects of capital outflows, according to a study by the staff of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In its monthly bulletin, the RBI has detailed an article on the risks emanating from capital outflows. “Applying a capital flows at risk approach, it is observed that in an adverse scenario, potential portfolio outflows can average up to 3.2 percent of GDP. In a black swan event comprising a combination of shocks, potential portfolio outflows can rise to 7.7 percent of GDP, highlighting the need for maintaining liquid reserves to quell such potential bouts of instability,” the article stated. ALSO READ: RBI Bulletin: Despite global headwinds, domestic macroeconomic conditions strengthen At 3.2 percent of GDP, the potential outflows could amount to $100.6 billion in a year, the article elaborates. Given that such a large outflow could destabilise domestic markets and pressure the exchange rate, a significant pile of foreign exchange reserves could act as a critical cushion. India’s forex reserves currently stand at roughly $600 billion and has been projected as a key factor in limiting the impact of global volatility on the domestic economy and markets. “All instruments, including prudential and other capital flow measures, are an integral part of the playbook, and often the measures of the first resort. In the ultimate analysis, spillovers can be global but the responsibility for macroeconomic and financial stability is national. This focuses attention on the role of international reserve accumulation as the only reliable safety net,” the bulletin said. Positive economic growth differentials with advanced economies and higher term premium on local bonds are the key factors that attract capital inflows into India. On the other hand, global risk aversion is the single biggest factor in triggering capital outflows, the bulletin said. Foreign investors have pulled out $26 billion from the domestic markets since January this year. The result has been a depreciation of 5 percent of the Indian rupee and a depletion of forex reserves. Also see: Chart of Day: Forex reserves are no vibranium shield against Fed tightening Reserves have fallen by $42 billion from the record high level in September 2021 as the RBI dipped into it to intervene in the market and limit the impact of global risk aversion on the exchange rate. Along with a swelling import bill due to high global crude oil prices, the import cover offered by the reserves has come down to 10 months from a high of 28 months in early 2020. Import cover and the ratio of reserves to short-term debt are key metrics through which the adequacy of reserves is gauged. The bulletin highlighted that adequacy of reserves should also be judged by the probability of sharp outflows expected against the stockpile of total portfolio investment and short-term trade credit. As of December 2021, India’s short-term trade credit stood at $110.5 billion while total portfolio investment was $288 billion, the central bank said."
6,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | What relief rally?,economy," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. The US Federal Reserve’s mega 75 basis points (bps) rate hike announced on Wednesday was the biggest in nearly 30 years. Yet, it was not surprising, given the imminent need to tame inflation, which is rising at its fastest pace in 40 years in the US. The puzzling question, however, is how much is enough to cool spiralling prices? Given sticky inflation data, Fed chair Jerome Powell’s salvos are likely to continue through the year with another 50 bps or 75 bps hike in July. Working backwards from the Federal Open Market Committee’s forecast of the Fed Funds rate touching 3.4 per cent by this year end (2022), there could be 50 bps rate hikes in each of the four Fed meetings this year, points out MC Pro’s research analyst Anubhav Sahu in this article. While policymakers seem confident that the US economy is well-positioned to deal with higher interest rates, much of the inflation is fanned mainly by high energy and commodity prices due to supply constraints precipitated by the Russia-Ukraine war, about which no central bank has any control. In fact, inflation fears have engulfed most nations. According to American think tank Pew Research Center, in 37 of the 44 nations studied, the average annual inflation rate in the first quarter of this year was at least twice what it was in the first quarter of 2020, as COVID-19 was beginning its deadly spread. In 16 countries, first-quarter inflation was more than four times the level of two years earlier. While US and Asian markets seem unscathed by Powell’s aggressive hikes, in India, the relief rally seen early in the day started fizzling by noon. Although it is now certain that most central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India, may try to get in front of the curve, high interest rates could also see some economies slowing down. Rating agency ICRA in its latest Business Activity Monitor, an index of high frequency economic indicators, signalled tepid momentum in economic activity in May 2022, amid the geopolitical headwinds. It expects uneven economic growth with services consumption prioritised and high inflation to eat into the demand for discretionary goods. Sure, Indian indices have fallen on the back of strong selling by foreign institutional investors in the past few months. This may have taken away some froth from valuations but, bear in mind that there haven’t been significant earnings downgrades yet. Pankaj Tibrewal, senior VP & fund manager (equity) at Kotak Mahindra AMC, writes in this piece that the third stage of market fall — a downturn in the economy and earnings downgrades — is yet to play out.

7,Banking | Are Indian investors of a lesser god?,economy," Sowmini Prasad and Deepti George Indian banks have accumulated risks well before 2010. They had gone largely undetected by both regulators and markets until liquidity events or regulatory events such as AQR made it difficult to keep rolling over the bad debt. The Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have had to react with policy measures with thus far, mixed results. This tactical, reactive approach is unsustainable as it distorts credit markets, not to mention, credit blow-ups are becoming a regular feature. Experts attribute the robustness (or the lack thereof) of banks’ risk management practices, governance quality, and the RBI’s supervisory processes as reasons for such risk build-ups. We contend that poor disclosure standards, for instance, on asset quality, is a key contributor to India’s woes. The information asymmetry not only breeds governance issues, but also allows the management, the auditors, and the regulator to look the other way till it becomes too late. Worrisome Gap In Standards We undertook a comprehensive benchmarking exercise of the public risk disclosure regime in Indian banking with other regimes and conventions. We found that the disclosure standards on risk position and risk management practices, including on credit risk, fall short when compared against the Basel Committee’s 1998 Framework on Enhancing Bank Transparency. Indian market participants have no visibility into basic information such as standard assets across Days Past Due (DPD) buckets, the separated risk compositions of banking and trading books by economic sector/industry and geography, or even the creditworthiness of trading book counterparties by rating categories (beyond whether they are investment grade or not/unrated/unlisted). Investors Of A Lesser God Next, we compared the actual asset quality disclosures made by a leading Indian bank in India for 2019-20 and 2020-21, against those made by the same Indian bank in the United States to comply with the SEC requirements for listing American Depository Shares. We found that the Indian bank was already making these disclosures for US investors, who tend to be better informed than Indian investors on three important dimensions. One, age analysis or past due status of gross loans, retail and wholesale with further sub-classification by retail credit products by < 30, 31 to 90, > 90 DPD buckets, is unavailable in India. Indian investors must make do with disclosures on assets after they have turned non-performing. Further, distribution by loan portfolio type (retail, wholesale) is unavailable, and distribution of loans by industry is presented only for NPAs. Two, classification of loans by credit quality indicator by year of origination; performing and non-performing retail loans with further sub-classification by retail credit products; wholesale loans as pass, labelled (with evidence of weakness), and non-performing — is unavailable in India. Three, granular information on the top 10 credit accounts that are non-performing — such as industry type, type of banking arrangement (sole, consortium, multiple), gross and net principal outstanding, the share of the bank in collateral value, and status of interest payment servicing — are disclosed in the US, but not in India. Arguably, had Indian investors known this information, they could have known that wholesale term loans originated before 2017 have the highest NPA ratio at 10.17 percent, and that as of March 31, 2020, commercial equipment and construction finance had the highest NPAs among various retail loan categories, at 3.1 percent, with 2.4 percent of the loans in the 31-90 DPD bucket. Further, they could have known that as of March 31, 2021, the highest share (17.6 percent) in the gross outstanding of the top 10 non-performing borrowers is that of a power sector borrower, followed by a housing finance company at 15.9 percent. Are More Asset Quality Disclosures A Tall Ask? Even in emerging markets, we find that Indonesia has a much higher level of risk disclosure, which shines light on any potential risk build-up. Banks there need to provide industry distribution of loans separately for those that are neither past due nor impaired (under monitoring/not under monitoring), past due but not impaired by DPD buckets (1-30/31-60/61-90) and impaired (NPA) (sub-standard/doubtful/loss). One might ask if there is a problem that the lack of disclosures is causing. What an investor cannot see, they cannot measure, and so they cannot price and give feedback to the banks’ management. By requiring only limited public reporting on asset quality, banks in India have enjoyed a level of opacity that banks in other jurisdictions do not. This means that risk build-ups may be known to people inside each bank, but not to those outside of it, namely all capital market participants, retail depositors, and most importantly, the RBI. So, investors are left in the lurch without information on whether banks are doing a good job of their core competency — risk management. Closing the informational gap is an essential first step that the regulator needs to take."
8,"Banks, financial institutions should proactively undertake stress testing of loan books: RBI Deputy Governor Rajeshwar Rao",economy," Despite the improvement in asset quality, financial institutions, including banks, need to proactively undertake stress testing of loan books to examine their loss absorption limits and take steps to improve them wherever required, RBI Deputy Governor M Rajeshwar Rao said on Thursday. The gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) and net NPAs of banks improved to 5.97 per cent and 1.7 per cent as of March 31, 2022, from 9.23 per cent and 3.66 per cent as of September 2019, respectively, he said. Although the asset quality has improved from the pre-pandemic levels, lenders should ascertain whether this is on account of better fundamentals or due to the regulatory support extended to deal with the impact of the pandemic, he noted. ""We expect banks and other financial institutions to proactively undertake stress testing of their loan books, subjecting them to various levels of stress, including extreme scenarios, to estimate the loss absorption limits wherever available at their disposal, and take measures to augment the same wherever necessary,"" Rao said at an event organised by IMC Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He said while the central bank has attempted to combat the impact of the pandemic on the financial system, (but) the task is only half done. ""We have to ensure that the financial system escapes unscathed as we exit from the pandemic-driven regulatory forbearances,"" Rao said. Rao said the pandemic saw the financial sector enjoying favourable momentum with an increase in liquidity, the flow of credit and normal spending on relief programmes. ""It is getting increasingly debated in the global fora as to whether the pandemic-induced measures have led to a build-up of leverage and debt overhang in the non-financial sector."
9,"Gujarat tops in share of India’s exports, aided by soaring petroleum product prices",economy," Gujarat accounted for the biggest chunk of India’s exports last year, bolstered by a jump in the value of petroleum products and diamond shipments, among other items. The western state’s share in the country’s total exports of $421.9 billion in FY22 was estimated at $126.8 billion, data from the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics in the ministry of commerce and industry showed. For every dollar earned from India’s exports, 30 cents worth of goods originated in Gujarat, up from about 21 cents in FY21. The value of exports from the state more than doubled in one year. In contrast, the shares of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu – the second- and third-largest contributors, respectively – shrank even after their exports grew robustly.  Gujarat’s biggest exports were petroleum products – diesel, petrol, aviation turbine fuel and other distillates – produced at refineries owned by Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy. Jamnagar, where Reliance Industries operates the world’s largest refining hub, emerged as the district that contributed the most to exports. The district of Devbhumi Dwarka, where Nayara has its refinery, was the 12th-largest contributor to export earnings.  The Nayara refinery was originally set up by the Essar Group. Russia’s Rosneft and others acquired a controlling stake in the project in 2017. The commerce ministry data showed that six Gujarat districts were among the top 20 contributing the most to exports. These included Surat, famous for diamond processing, and Ahmedabad. Earnings rise, share falls Maharashtra’s share in export earnings declined to about 17 percent in FY22 from about 20 percent in FY21 even after a 25 percent growth in the value of its exports. Maharashtra was the top exporter till FY20. Mumbai, Mumbai Suburban, Pune and Thane were among the top districts from the state contributing to export of goods. Diamonds and jewellery were among the top exports from Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban districts.  Tamil Nadu’s share in exports slipped to 8.3 percent from 9 percent after a robust 34 percent growth. About 28 percent of the southern state’s exports originated in Kanchipuram district and another 16 percent in Chennai. Kanchipuram emerged as the seventh-largest contributor to export earnings among all districts of the country, primarily due to the automobile manufacturing hub in the town of Sriperumbudur. Andhra, Karnataka swap ranks While the ranking of the top three contributors of exports did not change in FY22, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka swapped their fourth and sixth positions, respectively, as exports from Karnataka rose 71 percent compared to a 15 percent growth in Andhra Pradesh. Karnataka gained from the rise in petroleum prices as Mangaluru-based Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals exports diesel, ATF and other distillates. Karnataka’s share in the nation’s exports climbed to 6.1 percent from 5.2 percent in FY21, while that of Andhra Pradesh declined to 4.6 percent from 5.8 percent. Also Read | The two hurdles that stand in the way of India’s exports ambition Uttar Pradesh’s share in exports declined to 5 percent from 5.6 percent, but it held on to its position as the fifth-largest contributor of exports, with Gautam Buddha Nagar (comprising Noida) the ninth-largest exporting district in the country. Mobile phones were among the chief exports from Gautam Buddha Nagar. Commodity cycle impact A sharp rise in commodity prices aided the almost 45 percent rise in exports in FY22. Petroleum product exports jumped 161 percent from the previous year as prices climbed to multi-year highs. Volumes also grew from the previous year as economies emerged out of lockdowns. The share of petroleum products in exports climbed to about 16 percent from less than 9 percent a year earlier. The value of exported items in the trade basket grew but there was only a marginal change in their share in earnings. Shipments of pearls and precious and semi-precious stones climbed over 52 percent as households splurged money that they would have otherwise spent on contact-intensive services and travel on expensive and luxury goods. However, its share in export earnings rose to 6.6 percent from 6.2 percent. Exports of jewellery made of gold and other precious metals rose 67 percent, but its share in exports rose incrementally to 2.6 percent."

16,"Fuel Prices on June 16: Check petrol, diesel rates in Delhi, Mumbai, and other cities",economy," Petrol and diesel prices have held steady for over three weeks, according to a price notification by fuel retailers. Fuel prices have remained unchanged ever since the government on May 21 announced an excise duty cut on petrol by a record Rs 8 per litre and on diesel by Rs 6 per litre. The cut translated into a reduction of Rs 9.5 a litre for petrol in Delhi and Rs 7 a litre for diesel. Petrol in Delhi now costs Rs 96.72 a litre as against Rs 105.41 a litre before, while diesel costs Rs 89.62 a litre as opposed to Rs 96.67 earlier. In Mumbai, one litre of petrol costs R s 111.35 and diesel Rs 97.28.In Chennai, petrol and diesel prices are Rs 102.63 and Rs 94.24 per litre, respectively. In Kolkata, petrol is Rs 106.03, and diesel is Rs 92.76 per litre. Oil marketing companies are passing on the excise duty cut to consumers despite incurring a loss of Rs 13.08 a litre on petrol and Rs 24.09 on diesel. India meets 80 percent of its oil needs through imports.

17,India diesel sales rise 48% in first two weeks of June,economy," India's gasoil demand rose at a rapid pace during the first two weeks of June, preliminary data released on Wednesday showed, and long queues appeared at some fuel stations as concerns grew over supply. State-controlled retailers sold 3.4 million tonnes of gasoil from June 1 to 14, up 47.8% from the same period a year earlier and 12% from the same period last month, the data showed. Sales of gasoline were 1.28 million tonnes, up 54.2% year-over-year. The government on Wednesday played down concerns about fuel supply, saying unprecedented demand growth has created some temporary logistics issues in more remote places. ""The increase in demand has been on account of the seasonal surge in demand due to agricultural activities, (and) bulk buyers having shifted their purchases to retail outlets,"" the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas said in a statement. State-run Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and BPCL own about 90% of the country's retail fuel outlets.

18,Dollar extends gains after Fed rate decision,economy," The U.S. dollar extended its gains on Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to stem a disruptive surge in inflation. The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0.35% at 105.66. The US Federal Reserve on June 15 announced a three-quarter of a percentage point or a 75 bps hike in key lending rates, in what is being seen as a move to curb the spiralling inflation. The 75 bps rate hike, as announced by the Fed, is biggest since 1994, and was delivered after recent data showed little progress in its inflation battle. The 75 bps rate hike, as announced by the Fed, is biggest since 1994, and was delivered after recent data showed little progress in its inflation battle. While no policymaker projected an outright recession, the range of economic growth forecasts edged toward zero in 2023 and the federal funds rate was seen falling in 2024."
19,US Federal Reserve raises interest rate by 75 bps; biggest hike since 1994,economy," The US Federal Reserve on June 15 announced a three-quarter of a percentage point or a 75 bps hike in its target interest rate, in what is being seen as a move to curb the spiralling inflation. The central bank, while announcing the rate hike, said it is ""strongly committed"" to returning inflation to two percent. It projected a slowing down of the country's economy in the months to come, and a likely increase in the rate of unemployment. The Fed officials flagged a faster path of increases in borrowing costs to come as well, more closely aligning monetary policy with a rapid shift this week in financial market views of what it will take to bring price pressures under control. ""Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices and broader price pressures,"" the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement at the end of its latest two-day meeting in Washington. The statement continued to cite the Ukraine war and China lockdown policies as sources of inflation. Also Read | US consumer price inflation accelerates to 40-year high of 8.6% in May The action raised the short-term federal funds rate to a range of 1.50 percent to 1.75 percent, and Fed officials at the median projected the rate increasing to 3.4 percent by the end of this year and to 3.8 percent in 2023 - a substantial shift from projections in March that saw the rate rising to 1.9 percent this year. The stricter monetary policy was accompanied with a downgrade to the Fed's economic outlook, with the economy now seen slowing to a below-trend 1.7 percent rate of growth this year, unemployment rising to 3.7 percent by the end of this year, and continuing to rise to 4.1 percent through 2024. While no policymaker projected an outright recession, the range of economic growth forecasts edged toward zero in 2023 and the federal funds rate was seen falling in 2024. The projections are a break with recent Fed efforts to cast tighter monetary policy and inflation control as consistent with steady and low unemployment. The 4.1 percent jobless rate seen in 2024 is now slightly above the level Fed officials generally see as consistent with full employment. Since March, when Fed officials projected they could raise rates and control inflation with the unemployment rate remaining around 3.5 percent, inflation has stubbornly remained at a 40-year high, with no sign of it reaching the peak Fed policymakers hoped would arrive this spring. Even with the more aggressive interest rate measures taken on Wednesday, policymakers nevertheless see inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index at 5.2 percent through this year and slowing only gradually to 2.2 percent in 2024. Kansas City Fed President Esther George was the only policymaker to dissent in Wednesday's decision in preference for a half-percentage-point hike. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT) to elaborate on the latest policy meeting. Inflation has become the most pressing economic issue for the Fed and begun to shape the political landscape as well, with household sentiment worsening amid rising food and gasoline prices."
20,Oil prices fall ahead of expected US interest rate hike,economy," Brent crude futures for August were down 50 cents, or 0.4%, at $120.67 a barrel as of 1357 GMT, having fallen as low as $119.40 per barrel earlier in the session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July fell 71 cents, or 0.6%, to $118.22 a barrel, having fallen to $116.99/bbl earlier in the session. ""Oil markets are seeing uncertainty over what central banks do next and how that impacts oil demand,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo. Surging inflation has led investors and oil traders to brace for a big move by the Fed this week: a 75 basis points increase, which would be the largest U.S. interest rate hike in 28 years. Stronger monetary policy tightening could ""pave the way for recession-induced demand destruction,"" PVM analyst Stephen Brennock said. The European Central Bank promised fresh support and a new tool on Wednesday to temper a market rout that has fanned fears of a new debt crisis on the euro area's southern rim but appears to have disappointed investors looking for bolder steps. Adding to demand woes, China's latest COVID outbreak has raised fears of a new phase of lockdowns. Higher oil prices and weakening economic forecasts are dimming futures demand prospects, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday. But persistent concerns about tight supply meant oil prices were still holding near $120 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, are struggling to reach their monthly crude production quotas, recently hit by a political crisis that has reduced Libya's output. ""Because OPEC production is still falling noticeably short of the announced level, this would result in a supply deficit of around 1.5 million barrels per day on the oil market in the second half of the year,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodity analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Oil prices gained some support from tight gasoline supply. U.S. President Joe Biden told oil companies to explain why they were not putting more gasoline into the market. U.S. crude and distillate inventories rose last week, while gasoline stockpiles fell, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. U.S. Department of Energy stock data is due on Wednesday."
21,US Fed ponders huge rate hike to combat price surge,economy," The US Federal Reserve is set to announce a sharp increase in borrowing costs on Wednesday amid the troubling acceleration of inflation, and forecasters now expect officials to opt for the biggest rate hike in nearly three decades. Until recently, the central bank seemed set to again increase the benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points, but a resurgence of consumer and producer prices in May has fueled growing speculation of a 75-basis-point hike. Economists say the rapidly changing situation means the Fed is behind the curve and needs to react strongly to prove its resolve to combat inflation ""It is possible that by Wednesday the only way for the Fed to surprise markets would be to raise rates by 50 bp,"" Harvard economist and former White House advisor Jason Furman tweeted. If policymakers decide on a giant step, it would be the first 75-basis-point increase since November 1994. The Federal Open Market Committee resumed discussions on the second day of its policy meeting and is due to announce the rate decision at 1800 GMT. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference after the meeting to provide more details on the central bank's plans, including signals on how aggressive policymakers will be in coming meetings. President Joe Biden has fully endorsed the Fed's battle against the steepest rise in prices in more than 40 years, as he watches inflation erode his popularity and deflect attention from other milestones, including a rapid recovery of the world's largest economy and record job growth. Clear signals US central bankers began raising interest rates off zero in March as buoyant demand from American consumers for homes, cars and other goods clashed with transportation and supply chain snarls in parts of the world where Covid-19 remained -- and remains -- a challenge. That fueled inflation, which got dramatically worse after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and Western nations imposed steep sanctions on Moscow, sending food and fuel prices up at a blistering rate. US gasoline prices have topped $5.00 a gallon for the first time ever and are setting new records daily. Economists thought March was the peak for consumer price hikes, but the rate spiked again in May, jumping 8.6 percent in the latest 12 months, and wholesale prices surged as well, almost entirely due to soaring costs for energy, especially gasoline. The Fed was caught off guard with the speed of the price increases, and while policymakers usually prefer to clearly telegraph any policy shift to financial markets, the latest data likely changed the calculus. Powell had indicated policymakers were poised to implement another half-point increase in the benchmark borrowing rate this week and yet another next month, aiming to douse red-hot inflation without tipping the economy into recession and avoid a bout of 1970s-style stagflation. ""The 75bp hike... will be about making people/markets believe that they're serious about continuing to have higher rates in 2023,"" Furman said. However, the central bank cannot influence supply issues, and rate hikes only work by cooling demand and slowing the economy -- meaning policymakers are walking a fine line between having an impact and doing too much. And the impact won't be immediate. ""Monetary policy operates with lags, today's inflation reflects decisions taken a year ago,"" said Adam Posen, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former central banker. ""Had Fed hiked in 2021Q2/Q3, then inflation now would be different -- not least (because) the current global shocks wouldn't be piling on already high inflation,"" he said on Twitter. Biden has been scrambling to find a way to ease the pain on American families, including lambasting oil companies that are pulling in record profits. In a letter to oil executives, he called the high windfall ""unacceptable"" and demanded ExxonMobil, Chevron and others ""take immediate actions to increase the supply of gasoline, diesel, and other refined product,"" according to media reports."
22,"Petrol pumps in hinterland go dry, govt says sufficient supplies to meet demand",economy," Some petrol pumps in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka have run dry following a sudden surge in demand at PSU outlets that followed curtailment of operations by private fuel retailers to check the heavy losses they were suffering from trying to compete with heavily under-priced rates of public sector companies. The government however said there were sufficient supplies of petrol and diesel to meet extra demand but admitted that the rush to PSU bunks was leading to delays and increased waiting time for customers. PSU fuel retailers Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL haven't raised petrol and diesel prices in tandem with the rise in crude oil (raw material cost). They sell petrol at a loss of Rs 14-18 per litre and diesel at Rs 20-25 – a loss that private retailers Nayara Energy, Jio-bp and Shell aren't able to absorb. PSU fuel retailers Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL haven't raised petrol and diesel prices in tandem with the rise in crude oil (raw material cost). A few petrol pumps of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) in states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh ran out of fuel, particularly diesel after customers of private retailers shifted to them. HPCL in a tweet stated that its pumps in Rajasthan had seen a near 41 per cent rise in petrol sales in May over the previous month and 32 per cent in diesel while sales of private companies fell 10.5 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. In Madhya Pradesh, the petrol sales rose 40.6 per cent and diesel by 46.1 per cent as compared to a 4.3 per cent and 29.5 per cent drop in private fuel retailers. BPCL too has witnessed a similar volume surge in these states. ""In the past few days, some areas have reported a big increase in instances of rush at the PSU retail outlets (petrol pumps), leading to delays and increased waiting time for customers. This has, in turn, led to speculation of supply constraints by the public sector oil marketing companies,"" the oil ministry said in a statement. At specific locations in some states, there has been a 50 per cent increase in demand for petrol and diesel in the first half of June over the corresponding period of last year. Petrol & Diesel Rates Yesterday Wednesday, 22nd June, 2022 Petrol Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Wednesday, 22nd June, 2022 Diesel Rate in Mumbai Yesterday ""In particular, this has been noticed in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka,"" it said. ""These are states where large quantity of supply was being done by retail outlets belonging to private marketing companies and where the distances from supply locations i.e. terminals and depots are longer."" The ministry attributed the increase in demand to a seasonal surge due to agricultural activities, bulk buyers shifting their purchases to petrol pumps and a substantial reduction in the sales by private firms whose volumes shifted to PSU bunks. It however did not say why the bulk buyers shifted or the reason for reduction in sales by private firms. Industry sources said while petrol pump rates have not increased in tandem with cost, the price for bulk buyers such as state bus undertaking has gone up. And so the bulk buyers find it cheaper to fill at petrol pumps rather than buy directly from oil companies. Industry sources said while petrol pump rates have not increased in tandem with cost, the price for bulk buyers such as state bus undertaking has gone up. ""The production of petrol and diesel in the country is more than sufficient to take care of any demand surge. This unprecedented growth has created some temporary logistics issues at the local level. ""Oil companies have geared up to tackle these issues by increasing the stocks at the depots and terminals, extra movement of tank trucks and lorries to serve the retail outlets; extended working hours of depots and terminals including at night, and provision of extra quantities of fuels for supply in the affected states,"" the ministry said. Companies, it said, are ensuring that sufficient supplies of petrol and diesel are available to cater to this extra demand, and they are committed to fulfilling the energy needs of the nation. ""There is unprecedented growth in petrol and diesel demand at retail outlets in few states,"" HPCL said in a tweet. ""We assure everyone that there is adequate petrol and diesel stocks for uninterrupted supplies to our retail network in all markets."" It posted numbers for an increase in petrol and diesel demand at its petrol pumps in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and a reduction in sales by private companies. ""We stand committed to serve our esteemed customers at all times. There is no need to panic,"" it added. IOC Director (Marketing) in a tweet said: ""We reiterate that there is sufficient product availability and supplies to retail outlets are being met inline with demand. Request not to panic at all. We reassure our full commitment to serve you at all times without interruption."" BPCL said its outlets in Rajasthan have seen petrol and diesel volume grow 63 per cent in first fortnight of June. In Madhya Pradesh, the volume surge was 43 per cent. BPCL said its outlets in Rajasthan have seen petrol and diesel volume grow 63 per cent in first fortnight of June."

Somaiya added, ""We expect the USD-INR to trade with sideways and quote in the range of 77.70 and 78.40."" The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.64 per cent to 104.84. Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, declined 1.07 per cent to USD 119.87 per barrel. On the domestic equity market front, the BSE Sensex ended 152.18 points or 0.29 per cent lower at 52,541.39, while the broader NSE Nifty shed 39.95 points or 0.25 per cent to 15,692.15. Continuing their selling spree, foreign institutional investors offloaded shares worth a net Rs 4,502.25 crore on Tuesday, as per stock exchange data. ""The Indian Rupee depreciated against the dollar on Wednesday, in line with mostly weaker regional peers ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy announcement,"" said Sriram Iyer, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities. Lack of any major triggers kept the rupee in a small trading band. The US dollar index traded lower as traders braced for the US Fed meeting outcome. According to Emkay Global Financial Services, the US dollar is expected to soar further and equity markets will come under pressure if the Fed takes an aggressive stance for future rate hikes even if it hikes rates by 75 bps on Wednesday."
24,GST Council's GoM to meet on June 17 to discuss rate rationalisation,economy," The Group of Ministers (GoM), appointed by the Goods and Service Tax (GST) Council, will meet on June 17 to discuss rate rationalisation, sources told CNBC-TV18. The GoM, headed by Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, will discuss the proposal to shift the taxation rate slabs from the current five percent to seven or eight percent, and from 18 percent to 20 percent, the news channel learnt from persons privy to the development. The current tax slabs, under the GST regime, are five percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent. The GoM would also discuss the proposal to correct the inverted duty structure in textiles, the report said, adding that the ministerial panel is also expected to prune the list of exemptions to be continued under the GST. The panel was, notably, set up in September last year to come up with recommendations related to changes in the taxation structure. The committee has been asked to submit its report before the next meeting of the GST Council, which is likely to be held by June-end. According to CNBC-TV18, the GoM is likely to finalise its report if there is no dissent made by Rajasthan, West Bengal and Kerala -- the three Opposition-ruled states. The other states which are part of the panel are Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Goa. The meeting on June 17 will be the second time when the GoM members will hold deliberations. The last meeting among them was held in November 2021. The panel's report, once finalised, will be scrutinised by the GST Council, headed by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, which will take a final call on its implementation."

0,"Interview |Ireland an attractive study destination; visa and residency processes are efficient, says ambassador Brendan Ward",economy," Ireland is a small country but seems to be punching above its weight when it comes to Indian students looking to study abroad. At present, some 10,000 Indian students are pursuing higher education there and thousands more are set to join them this year. In an interview to Moneycontrol, Brendan Ward, the ambassador of Ireland to India, said the process of issuing visa and residency permits for foreign students, including Indians, is efficient and competitive, underlining why his country is increasingly becoming an attractive destination for Indian students. He also spoke about the favourable post-study visa rules and part-time work permits of between 20 and 40 hours a week that allow students to earn while they learn. Besides Indian students, Ward said Ireland is becoming a favoured destination for highly skilled Indian professionals and healthcare workers like nurses. In 2022 alone, the country is set to let in about 7,000 such professionals, including 2,000 high-skills workers. He said the Indian expat population in Ireland is now around 50,000 and growing by about 10 percent a year, and working as a huge support system for visiting Indian students and professionals. Edited excerpts from the interview: How many Indian students are in Ireland right now? About 10,000 Indian students are in Ireland. We would have around 5,000 (Indian) students going to Ireland this year. A vast majority of them are going for one-year or two-year master’s programmes, some are doing PhDs, and a small number doing undergraduate studies. Ireland is a small country but some 10,000 Indian students pursuing higher education there looks like a good number. What does this signify? The Indian community in Ireland has been growing rapidly in the last 10-15 years. We estimate that there are now around 50,000 Indians who are living long-term in Ireland. That makes for a good support network for Indian students who decide to pursue studies in Ireland. Another factor is the ability to work after graduation in Ireland. So, students are granted a two-year stay-back visa after they complete their master’s or other degrees. The environment in Ireland—with all of the major ICT (information and communications technology) companies being present, pharma companies and a vibrant financial services sector—means there are plenty of jobs there for those graduates. The unemployment level in Ireland is slightly over 4 percent and in economic terms, it is called full employment. And there is a constant demand in sectors like ICT, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) areas, and financial services. The fact that Ireland is an English-speaking country does make it more accessible for Indian students. The UK has been a traditional destination for Indian students. And of late, it is making a renewed effort to attract talent/students (to make up for some lost ground). Will Ireland miss out eventually? Are you making some changes to visa or immigration rules? Not particularly. We are, of course, aware of which are the countries—not just the United Kingdom—which are attracting foreign students, particularly Indian students. The UK is working to catch up and reverse some of their mistakes. We don’t have to worry about the United Kingdom. Our visa processes and residency processes for students from all over the world, not just from India, are efficient and competitive… We are, of course, looking at ways in which we can make Ireland a more attractive destination. The more students we have from more foreign countries, the more experience we gain. And the universities have substantial bodies of Indian students in some cases. When I was a student in University of Dublin, Trinity College (some four decades back) there were five or six Indian students and today it has about 800 Indian students. You said Ireland is home to some 50,000 Indian expats. Does this mean Ireland is becoming a destination for Indian professionals as well? Ireland is already an attractive destination. Our visa office, which is here in the building (the place where the interview happened), is expecting to issue 2,000 visas to highly qualified Indian skilled professionals who are going to work for Irish, international or Indian companies in our country. Then we also have about 4,000 to 5,000 Indian nurses and healthcare professionals who will travel to Ireland this year. So there is quite a strong flow. The Indian population in Ireland is growing about 10 percent each year. And this growth of the Indian population is not a concern back home? Not really. Traditionally, Irish people went around the world—Britain, the US, Canada, Australia, etc, but in the last 20 years it has kind of reversed. And now about one person out of every six living in Ireland is born abroad. In general, most migrants or as we call them in our country, ‘New Irish’, are pretty well integrated and settled well. The Indian community in particular are professionals, educated people, with a high standard of English, and some international exposure. The profile of Indians in Ireland is completely different. We are quite a young country… Almost half of the population is under 30. Our minister for higher education is in his early 30s. It’s almost the same in education and businesses, etc. Is there a number that Irish universities are targeting from India? Indian students’ numbers (in Ireland) are growing around 10 percent per year. Of course, everything got disrupted during the two years of 2020 and 2021 (due to Covid-19). But it’s not just about Indian students… We have a good number of students from China, from the United States, etc. Our universities aim for somewhere around 20 percent of foreign students in the overall students body. They enrich the education experience. We do understand that the cost of (foreign) education is high for Indians, so we are ensuring that the experience is very good…and the education received is both high quality, globally competitive and globally recognised. What kind of courses are Indian students going for in terms of domain? Well, the majority of them are going for master’s degrees in courses related to ICT, STEM subjects, and in some cases, they are going for master's courses in business and finance. Some are in medical and pharma-related areas, and a very small number for courses in humanities and liberal arts. You touched upon how your government is mindful of students’ desire to earn while studying. Please elaborate."
1,Oil prices fall as expected U.S. interest rate hike looms,economy," Oil prices fell on Wednesday on concerns about fuel demand and global economic growth before an expected big hike in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Brent crude futures for August were down $1.27, or 1%, at $119.90 a barrel as of 1001 GMT, in volatile trading. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July fell $1.44, or 1.2%, to $117.49 a barrel. ""Oil markets are seeing uncertainty over what central banks do next and how that impacts oil demand,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo. Surging inflation has led investors and oil traders to brace for a big move by the Fed this week – a 75-basis-point increase, which would be the largest U.S. interest rate hike in 28 years. Stronger monetary policy tightening could ""pave the way for recession-induced demand destruction,"" PVM analyst Stephen Brennock said. The European Central Bank said on Wednesday it would hold a rare, unscheduled meeting on Wednesday to discuss turmoil in the bond markets. Adding to demand woes, China's latest COVID outbreak has raised fears of a new phase of lockdowns. Higher oil prices and dimming economic forecasts would weigh on demand prospects, the International Energy Agency said. But persistent concerns about tight supply meant oil prices were still holding near $120 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, are struggling to reach their monthly crude production quotas, recently hit by a political crisis that has reduced Libya's output. ""Because OPEC production is still falling noticeably short of the announced level, this would result in a supply deficit of around 1.5 million barrels per day on the oil market in the second half of the year,"" said Carsten Fritsch, commodity analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Oil prices gained some support from tight gasoline supply. U.S. President Joe Biden told oil companies to explain why they were not putting more gasoline on the market. U.S. crude and distillate inventories rose last week, while gasoline stockpiles fell, according to market sources citing American Petroleum Institute figures on Tuesday. U.S. Department of Energy stock data is due on Wednesday."
2,"Recent dip in cement demand is temporary, says Anil Singhvi of Shree Digvijay Cement",economy," The recent dip in cement demand was a blip and things should start improving from here, Shree Digvijay Cement Ltd Executive Chairman Anil Singhvi has said. ""I think there was some confusion on account of some statements made by the government that along with the steel prices cement prices will correct or come down and I don't think there is any policy change which was warranting that. Also, steel prices corrected, they were expecting cement prices to also come down and that is where perhaps the demand got slowed down because they were not placing orders,” Singhvi said in an interview to CNBC-TV18 on June 15. Though crude and coal prices have been rising for the last two-three months, the cement industry had not passed even half the spike to customers. If fuel prices cool, the industry would see some better margins in a couple of months. Even though Ultratech Cement's capacity expansion plan made the street nervous, Singhvi expects a 7-8 percent rise in demand for cement in the fiscal year 2023. The demand was unlikely to go down even though Ultratech Cement was adding capacity and Adani Group had entered the sector. Ultratech Cement recently announced a capex plan of Rs 12,886 crore to increase capacity by 22.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) through brownfield and greenfield projects."
3,"Petrol, diesel sales jump in June",economy," India's petrol consumption jumped by 54 per cent and that of diesel soared by 48 per cent in the first fortnight of June from a year earlier with continuing demand recovery from a relatively low base in 2021 when the world's third-biggest oil user was in the grip of the second wave of COVID-19. Petrol sales by state-owned fuel retailers, which control roughly 90 per cent of the market, at 1.28 million tonnes between June 1 and 14 was 54.2 per cent higher than the same period last year when a devastating second COVID-19 wave wreaked havoc on the economy. This consumption was 48.2 per cent higher than the demand in the first fortnight of June 2020 and 25 per cent more than the 1.02 million tonnes of sales in the pre-COVID June 2019. Month-on-month sales were up 0.8 per cent, preliminary industry data showed on Wednesday. Diesel, the most-used fuel in the country, saw sales jumping 47.8 per cent year-on-year to 3.4 million tonnes between June 1-14. This was 37.3 per cent higher than the corresponding period of June 2020 and 20.3 per cent more than the pre-COVID 2019 period. It was 12 per cent higher than the 3.03 million tonnes of consumption during May 1-14 this year. Industry sources said consumption in June was higher because demand returned after high prices in the previous month impacted sales. Also aiding the demand was the start of the harvesting season. Another factor was the low base effect. Cooking gas, whose prices were hiked by Rs 103.50 per cylinder since March, saw sales rising by 4.21 per cent to 1.06 million tonnes in the first fortnight of June. This was 20.3 per cent higher than 2020 and 28.1 per cent more than June 1-14, 2019. LPG consumption was 28.1 per cent more than June 2019 demand and 2.9 per cent higher than 1.03 million tonnes in May 2022."
4,AEPC to take 140-member delegation to 3 countries next month for boosting apparel exports,economy," Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) on Wednesday said it is taking a 140-member delegation to the UK, Japan and the US next month to further promote outbound shipments of the sector as these countries account for about 40 per cent of apparel exports. The delegation will be participating in three international fairs — Pure London, India Tex Trend Fair (ITTF) and Sourcing at Magic in the US — in July, AEPC said in a statement. Naren Goenka, Chairman of AEPC said these three markets alone have a share of more than 38 per cent of the total apparel exports market, valuing USD 6.8 billion in 2021. These shows will give an opportunity to exporters to showcase their products and supply capabilities of value-added products with special emphasis on the products designed to suit fashion trends and requirements, he said. He added that apparel imports into the UK have witnessed a positive mark in the last three years despite the pandemic. UK import from India in 2021 was USD 1092.1 million registering a growth of 12.6 per cent. At a category level, woven garments hold a much better acceptance in the UK as compared to knitted garments. The benefit from AEPC participation is, it will strengthen our position in the UK market before the India- UK FTA, which is expected to reduce the tariff further, he said. UK import from India in 2021 was USD 1092.1 million registering a growth of 12.6 per cent. At a category level, woven garments hold a much better acceptance in the UK as compared to knitted garments. While the US fashion companies continue to diversify their sourcing, Asia as a whole will remain dominant in 2022. Indian apparel exports to the US in 2021 stood at USD 4.5 billion, registering a growth of more than 40 per cent compared with last year."
5,90% of Businesses feel GST made doing business easy: Deloitte survey,economy," About 90 per cent of Indian industry leaders feel that GST has made doing business easier by bringing down barriers across the country, a Deloitte survey said on Wednesday. The GST regime has also positively affected the prices and costs of goods and services to end consumers, along with helping companies optimise their supply chains, Deloitte GST@5 Survey 2022 found. Automation of tax compliances and introduction of e-invoicing/e-way facility emerged as the most beneficial reforms introduced by the government. Also, creating a simplified tax regime to promote the ease of doing business and upgrading technology to facilitate auto population of monthly and annual returns were the key asks from industry leaders, as per the survey. A nationwide GST, which subsumed 17 local levies like excise duty, service tax and VAT and 13 cesses, was rolled out on July 1, 2017. Mahesh Jaising, Partner and Leader Indirect Tax, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP, said the buoyancy in the tax collection in recent months is an indicator of the success that this technologically driven tax reform has brought into the system and reflects the taxpayer-friendly nature of GST regime. He further added it will be interesting to watch new developments coming under the GST space with a decision expected on the extension of GST compensation cess; proposals to increase and scope of GST on online gaming; setting up of the GST tribunal; and GST small seller parity issue. ""Ninety percent Indian CXOs across key sectors have backed this dynamic and technologically driven indirect tax regime. Industry leaders are of the view that 'one nation, one tax' reform has certainly brought down barriers across the country and made doing business easy and effective for both businesses and taxpayers, the survey said. Looking ahead, industry looks forward to finding resolution to simplification of input tax credit matching, followed by reducing operational complexities for taxpayers. Industry leaders also consider managing tax disputes and the absence of appellate forums to resolve disputes as significant issues leading to serious long-term ramifications, it said. GST@5 Survey 2022 is conducted by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP. The survey has responses from 234 CXO and CXO-1 level individuals and was done over a period of four weeks. GST@5 Survey 2022 is conducted by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP."
6,"WTO makes final push for trade deals, with eyes on defiant India",economy," World Trade Organization members entered a tense final day of negotiations on Wednesday, with no certainty they would find consensus on any change to global trade rules and India adamant it would not yield on food, fisheries and vaccines. During its June 12-15 ministerial conference, its first major meeting in over four years, the 164-member body is seeking to agree on a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a reduction of fishing subsidies, pledges on food security and the launch of an internal reform. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told the more than 100 ministers present that time was running out and that they should ""go the extra mile"" to converge on the full range of issues. Delegates at the meeting said that India, which has a history of blocking multilateral trade deals, appeared far from ready to compromise. That view was supported by comments Indian Commerce Minister Shri Piyush Goyal made in closed sessions and which New Delhi chose to publish. India and South Africa and other developing countries have sought a waiver of intellectual property rights for vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for over a year, but faced opposition from several developed nations with major pharmaceutical producers. A provisional deal between major parties - India, South Africa, the United States and the European Union - emerged in May, but drew criticism from campaign groups that it falls short of what is needed. Goyal echoed that view. ""My own sense is that what we are getting is completely half baked and it will not allow us to make any vaccines,"" he said. The WTO has also pushed hard for a global deal to cut fishing subsidies, which would be only the second multilateral agreement since its creation 27 years ago and a demonstration of its relevance in an era of growing trade tensions. Goyal, in comments to delegates, said India was a strong advocate of sustainability, but its fishing industry did not operate huge fleets and relied on small-scale and often poor fishers. The minister said India and similar countries should be granted a 25-year transition period to phase out fishing subsidies, far longer than what most other WTO members have suggested."
7,I-T department notifies cost inflation index for current fiscal,economy," The Income Tax Department has notified the cost inflation index for the current fiscal to calculate long-term capital gains arising from the sale of immovable property, securities and jewellery. The cost inflation index (CII) is used by a taxpayer to compute gains arising out of the sale of capital assets after adjusting for inflation. The Cost Inflation Index for FY 2022-23 relevant to AY 2023-24 is 331. AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said the CII will help taxpayers to compute long-term capital gains tax, enabling them to remit advance tax on time. ""For the last couple of years, the inflation index has been rising faster, which depicts the mounting inflation in the country,"" Mohan added. AKM Global Head of Tax Markets Yeeshu Sehgal said the CII will be beneficial to taxpayers as assets, which are held for long term, are recorded at purchase cost despite increasing inflation. ""It is very important to adjust the said purchase cost with the new cost inflation index notified as 331 due to which the capital gains tax can be reasonably and fairly calculated,"" Sehgal said. CII or Cost Inflation Index is notified under the Income-tax Act, 1961, every year. It is popularly used to calculate the ""indexed cost of acquisition"" while calculating capital gains at the time of sale of any capital asset. CII or Cost Inflation Index is notified under the Income-tax Act, 1961, every year."
8,"US Fed Meeting Preview | Containing inflation top priority, 75 bps hike in interest rates likely",economy," Global stock markets have been in a volatile phase with a negative bias for quite some time now, given the unfavourable economic and non-economic factors. The Russia–Ukraine crisis doesn’t seem like abating soon which is resulting in elevated fuel, food and commodity prices. The markets which gained some comfort with the opening up of the Chinese economy was in for some more shock with the outbreak of a fresh Covid wave in Beijing. A rising inflation world wide has become the bone of contention for the central banks and economists across geographies. All emphasis is now being laid to control inflation for which the central banks have become more hawkish in their approach, and efforts to stem economic growth have gone somewhat on a backfoot. The Federal Reserve in its last meeting had decided to raise rates and maintained its hawkish stance. US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had signalled that the Fed’s policymaking committee expected to implement 0.5 percent increases at its next two meetings, but was not “actively considering” a more aggressive 0.75 percent increase. The annual pace of consumer price inflation in the US hit 8.6 percent in May as energy and food costs surged. US Treasuries have jumped since the start of April and is above the 3 percent mark. “Most expect that Fed rates could reach up to 3 percent by next February,” said a report from Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “In the recent times, treasuries have been under pressure as the Fed began its long-drawn process of quantitative tightening, reducing its balance sheet by allowing bonds that it bought to mature without replacing them.” The latest consumer price inflation in the US reached a 40-year high, causing a major concern for the Federal Reserve. “The equity markets are falling over concerns of soaring prices which mounted further following the release of the numbers and on anticipation of more hawkish stance by the Fed which is now expected to increase the interest rates by at least half-percentage point in a bid to tame inflation,” said Ravi Singh, Vice-President and Head of Research at ShareIndia. Experts, however, believe that if the Fed acts more aggressively, then the fear of plunging the economy into recession may trigger more sell-off in the market. “Traders see a 100 percent chance of a 75-bps rate hike in June, a 91 percent chance of a 75 bps rate hike in July, and a 50-bps rate hike fully discounted from each of the September and November meetings,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities. The main Fed rate is expected to rise to 3.68 percent by the end of 2022. “The recent inflation print of 8.6 percent for May reignited bets of steeper rate hike trajectory and we believe a 75-bps hike is priced into the market expectations and hence may not lead to any sharp reaction in the markets,” said Garima Kapoor, Economist at Elara Capital. “More than the current rate hike, the guidance as well as the language during the press meet will be more crucial,” she added. The markets have braced for a hawkish Fed, but investors will look for signal that the central bank is willing to get even tougher with rate hikes. “We can expect a rate hike of 0.75 bps, given the inflation numbers which have come out and any hike above 0.75 bps will be negative and one could see more correction coming in,” Juzer Gabajiwala, Director of Ventura Securities Ltd, said. The coming cycles will be again dependent on the inflation data and how it pans out. However, Sonam Srivastava, Founder of Wright Research, thinks that the market has already priced in a higher rate hike this time after the inflation numbers came out, but sees the volatility to persist even after this hike. “We believe that there will be 50 bps further rate hike in the September and November meetings as well apart from the expectations of 75 bps hikes in June and July, which would take the fund rate to 3.25 percent,” said Mohit Nigam, Head of PMS at Hem Securities. “We believe that the markets have not waited for the Fed meeting and they have already been front running them with digesting the quantum of rate hike,” he said. “The Fed is under pressure to quickly take its policy rate to the neutral level that neither stimulates nor restricts - and beyond,” said a report from Motilal Oswal. In its last projection report, the Fed expected that growth in the US could be at 2.6 percent and 2 percent for 2022 and 2023. On the other hand, jobless rate was predicted to average at the current level of 3.6 percent this year and the next, before mildly picking up to 3.8 percent in 2024. “Given upside inflation risk and very tight labour markets, monetary policy makers are likely to move policy to a tight stance, where rates stay above 'neutral' to better balance the shift back to an upside inflation risk profile,” the Motilal Oswal report said. “The commentary on winding down of Fed Balance sheet through Quantitative Tightening (QT) will be in focus and expect the equity markets to be volatile in the short term on account of rate increases, Rupee depreciation and liquidity tightening through QT,” Nishit Master, Portfolio Manager at Axis Securities, said. Once the rate expectations stabilise and markets get used to the liquidity tightening, he expects the equity markets to also stabilize. One should use the current short term volatility to build good quality long-term portfolio."
9,Exports rise 20.55% to $38.94 billion in May; trade deficit at record $24.29 billion,economy," India's merchandise exports in May rose by 20.55 per cent to USD 38.94 billion, while the trade deficit ballooned to a record USD 24.29 billion, according to the government data released on Wednesday. Imports during May 2022 grew by 62.83 per cent to USD 63.22 billion, the data showed. The trade deficit stood at USD 6.53 billion in the same month last year. Cumulative exports in April-May 2022-23 rose by about 25 per cent to USD 78.72 billion."
10,Policy errors of the 1970s echo in our times,economy," Martin Wolf

Unexpectedly high inflation, wars in key commodity-producing regions, declining real wages, slowing economic growth, fears of tightening monetary policy and turbulence in stock markets — we see all of these things in today’s world economy. These were also the dominant features of the world economy in the 1970s. That period ended in the early 1980s, with a brutal monetary tightening in the US, a sharp reduction in inflation and a wave of debt crises in developing countries, especially..."

12,"India looks to rains, not just rates, to cool hot inflation",economy," As India faces a crippling surge in food and fuel prices, its policymakers will be counting mostly on this year's monsoon rains, not just interest rate hikes, to take inflationary pressure off the country's households and businesses. Like its international peers, the Reserve Bank of India is expected raise rates aggressively over the next year to take some of the heat out of prices, but the global drivers of the country's inflation mean there are limits to what domestic monetary policy can achieve, analysts say. With 75% of India's price acceleration expected to come from food items, the focus for central bankers will be on the success of monsoon rains to boost production and replenish stockpiles, which would ease supply constraints and anchor price expectations. ""Will monetary policy action will be able to contain (food inflation)? Very honestly, it will not,"" said Indranil Pan, chief economist at Yes Bank. ""It will at best contain the second round implications and arrest the inflation expectations from moving on the higher side."" India's retail prices rose 7.04% in May year-on-year, data showed on Monday, slowing slightly from April's eight-year peak but still above the RBI's 2%-to-6% target band for a fifth straight. (Graphic on, India's WPI and CPI inflation: https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIA-INFLATION/akvezlgmwpr/chart.png) Current price increases, if sustained, would pile pressure on the government and more pressingly the central bank, which is politically accountable for extended breaches of the target band. Food and fuel are the two main sources of inflation in India and prices of most food items have shot up in recent months due to supply disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, erratic weather and export curbs. India meets two-thirds of its vegetable oil demand through imports. Sunflower oil imports from the Black Sea region have been crippled by the war while palm oil supplies have been hampered by Indonesia's export curbs. ""Until supplies are restored in the world market, prices will not come down to normal levels,"" said B.V. Mehta, executive director of Solvent Extractors' Association of India. MONSOON MAGIC This puts the burden on domestic production with hopes pinned on a normal monsoon season that could ease food prices in the second half of the fiscal year ending March 2023. But so far, rainfalls in the season starting June 1 are 36% lower than average. ""Vegetable prices jumped in the last few weeks as a heat wave damaged crops,"" said Mahesh Shinde, a Pune-based vegetable trader. ""Now below-normal monsoon rainfall is delaying planting."" India's monsoon is crucial for its farm output and economic growth, with just over half of arable land fed by rain. If this year's monsoon disappoints, analysts believe the government will have limited fiscal space to arrest prices. The government last month restricted wheat and sugar exports and announced a series of changes to commodity tax structures to insulate consumers. ""The RBI foresees inflation staying above 6% in the first three quarters of this fiscal, amounting to four straight quarters of above-target reading,"" said D. K. Joshi, chief economist at rating agency CRISIL. ""If the barometer stays above target for three consecutive quarters, the RBI is obliged to explain to the government"". POLITICALLY SENSITIVE While a good monsoon would bring some price relief, it is a factor the central bank has no control over. The world's fifth-largest and second-most populous economy has a troubled history with inflation: price surges have created social and political instability in the past that the Modi government will be keen to avoid. Authorities were able to keep wheat and rice prices down, defying a global spike, thanks to a pandemic-era foodgrain distribution scheme. However, with that programme scheduled to end in September - and grain stocks now down nearly 29% from a year ago - wheat prices could surge, a Mumbai-based dealer with a global firm said. (Graphic on, India wheat prices: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xmpjoxxjrvr/IndiaWheatPrices.png) Compounding that problem, the government's wheat purchases from farmers have more than halved this year after heat-waves slashed output. All of that risks reviving the kind of price pressures that have troubled politicians and bureaucrats in the past. India's Congress party, which ruled the country most of the time since independence in 1947, lost power in the 2014 general elections mainly due to double digit inflation and corruption charges. ""Inflation measured by various indices can be an abstract concept for consumers, but food and fuel inflation hit people's pocketbooks practically every day,"" said Amitabh Dubey, a political analyst at research company TS Lombard."
13,One interest rate segment stubbornly defies all RBI inducements,economy," The Indian economy was able to show a measure of resilience during the past 26 months of the pandemic thanks to a monetary safety net provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The package of measures included expanding money supply and pushing interest rates to historic lows. All system rates – such as interest rates charged on housing loans or on working capital advances to companies – also came down in response. In fact, the RBI had been..."
14,"Viral Acharya calls on central bankers not to compromise, embrace risk of losing job",economy," Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor Viral Acharya has called on central bankers to not compromise while performing their duties and raise issues with the government even if it comes at the cost of losing their job. ""Sometimes, the tendency of technocrats in central banks is to think, 'Oh, I have to do my regular day job, I have to do a part of my legal mandate well. So, let me just not confront these issues in my day-to-day dealings with the government. Let me just strike compromises or turn a blind eye,'"" Acharya said during a webinar hosted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on June 14 on the regulation, supervision, and handling of distress in public sector banks (PSBs). ""Of course, there are many technocrats who don't necessarily follow this approach. But I think that a string of technocrats each doing their job in a narrow space and making these compromises, actually leave their countries with a fairly bad outcome stitched together over periods of time."" ""I see compromises by central bankers in India over long stretches of time as having given fairly compromised and terrible banking sector outcomes over the last five decades. Of course, if you raise a voice, if you push for advocacy or reform of public sector banks, if you push openly for legal reforms, that is going to be difficult. It can lead sometimes to (chuckles) you not having the right relationships with the finance ministry. In extreme cases it can lead to a loss of job. But my sense is technocrats should embrace these risks,"" Acharya said. Acharya took charge as a deputy governor of the RBI in January 2017. However, he resigned in July 2019, around six months before the end of his three-year term, citing ""unavoidable personal circumstances"". RBI independence Acharya, who is the CV Starr Professor of Economics at New York University's Stern School of Business, enjoyed a fraught relationship with the government during his time at the RBI. In an October 2018 speech (external link), Acharya said governments that ""do not respect central bank independence will sooner or later incur the wrath of financial markets"". The speech, which came amid a tussle between the government and the RBI over the latter's reserves, created a furore. Acharya’s resignation from the RBI was preceded by similar high-level exits. Raghuram Rajan, who served a three-year term as the governor starting September 2013, faced repeated political attacks for his speeches regarding tolerance and central bank independence. In a letter to RBI staff in June 2016, Rajan wrote he would be returning to academia after his term ended. Meanwhile, Urjit Patel — Rajan's successor as governor — resigned on December 10, 2018, two years and three months into the job. Patel, who cited ""personal reasons"" in a statement announcing his resignation, also had a turbulent relationship with the government. In his book 'Overdraft', released in July 2020, Patel wrote that India's fledgling bankruptcy law was deliberately weakened in mid-2018 after the RBI released its famous February 12, 2018 circular that spelt out an amended framework for the resolution of banks' stressed assets. According to Patel, he and the then finance minister, the late Arun Jaitley, were ""until then, for the most part...on the same page"". However, the aforementioned circular led to a ""legal onslaught"" on the RBI, Patel wrote. Patel was succeeded by Shaktikanta Das on December 12, 2018. Das, a former economic affairs secretary, has been widely credited with repairing the relationship between North Block and Mint Street. Cost of PSU banks In his comments at the IMF webinar on June 14, Acharya said the Indian banking sector and the taxpayer were suffering from government ownership of banks. ""…certain rules and regulations of the banking sector have to be uniform. For example, you can't have an accounting standard for banks which is different between public sector banks and private banks. Why has India not adopted the IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) accounting system? Why has India not adopted expected credit loss provisioning? Why has India not adopted accelerated provisioning standards, which don't backload provisions after defaults and NPAs (non-performing assets) have been recognised?"" Acharya said the source of these problems was the government's refusal to loosen its purse strings further to infuse more capital into PSBs. The non-implementation of these standards and PSBs' ability to ""get away with certain kinds of extraordinarily delayed provisioning standards"", according to Acharya, was resulting in a “race to the bottom for the entire banking sector”. Calling the presence of PSBs in India a “historic accident”, Acharya said data and economic forces at play in India’s financial sector showed they were causing a huge loss to the taxpayer. ""Taxpayers in India are running a huge negative account because of the presence of public sector banks. And I think any gains that can be brought to the table, such as creation of bank accounts for financial inclusion…I am never able to attribute that success squarely at the doorstep of public sector banks,"" the former central banker said."

16,India rejects text on fisheries subsidy negotiations at WTO meet,economy," Rejecting the current text on fisheries subsidy negotiations, India on Tuesday said WTO members engaged in distant water fishing should stop providing any kind of subsides for 25 years as they provide significantly higher support measures and are indiscriminately exploiting the fisheries resources. For every fisher family, India gives barely USD 15 subsidy in a year. On the other hand, there are countries which give as high as USD 42,000, USD 65,000 and USD 75,000 to one fisherman's family. ""That is the extent of disparity that is sought to be institutionalised, through the current fisheries text,"" commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said. Subsidies like income and livelihood support during the seasonal no-fishing for regeneration of fish stock, and provision of social security nets to the socially disadvantaged fishing communities cannot contribute to overfishing. India has also sought a transition period of 25 years for developing nations, which are not fishing in distant waters, as the sector is still at a nascent stage. ""The transition period of 25 years sought by India is not intended as a permanent carve-out, it is a must-have for us and for other similarly placed non-distant water fishing countries. We feel that without agreeing to the 25-year transition period, it will be impossible for us to finalise the negotiations, as policy space is essential for the long-term sustainable growth and prosperity of our low-income fishermen,"" Goyal said. India's fisheries sector is traditional and small-scale in nature and it is essentially one of the disciplined nations in sustainably harnessing the fisheries resources. Making intervention on fisheries subsidies negotiation, Goyal said that India cannot agree to an ""imbalanced"" text which is scrutinising subsidies extended by the developing countries to their millions of small-scale and artisanal fishermen for meeting their genuine needs and enabling their access to fishing for livelihoods in their own EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone). The World Trade Organisation (WTO) members negotiate an agreement through a text. It would be a matter of great concern for India that countries engaging in distant water fishing are provided carved out under the shelter of conservation and management measures in the draft ministerial text on fisheries subsidies, he added. ""India would strongly urge that distant water fishing nations should be subject to a moratorium on giving any kind of subsidies for 25 years for fishing or fishing-related activities beyond their EEZ (200 nautical miles from sea shore). It is essential that they transfer these capacities to the developing countries and LDCs (Least Developed Countries) to give them a chance to grow,"" the minister said. The WTO members are negotiating the fisheries subsidies agreement, which aims at eliminating subsidies for legal, unregulated and unreported fishing; curbing subsidies for overfishing and over capacity; and promoting sustainable fishing. The current text, he said, has not provided a level-playing field to the developing nations to address the aspirations of their traditional fishers. Nearly 9 million families in India depend on assistance and support from the government. ""Any decision not to provide space for small-scale and traditional fishers to expand their capabilities would only rip away their future opportunities,"" Goyal said. Further, the minister said that a lot of countries are very concerned about their fishermen whose population is about 11,000 or 23,000 or 12, 000. ""The concern of the small number of fishermen prevails over the livelihood of nine million fishermen in India. This is completely unacceptable! And that is the reason, India is opposed to the current text,"" he added. ""The concern of the small number of fishermen prevails over the livelihood of nine million fishermen in India. Besides the issue of setting the geographical limits (12 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles) for providing subsidies to traditional fishermen, the other contentious issue in the current text is about deciding which developing nation or least developed countries will be exempted from prohibiting certain subsidies that lead to overfishing. WTO members are discussing whether to set the limit at nations with less than 0.7 per cent or 0.8 percent of the global marine catch. ""A de-minimis on the global catch basis without reference to the fishing, the fishermen families involved, the size of the nation, the size of the population being supported is a completely arbitrary and unfair situation. Whether 0.7 or 0.8 per cent, it does not take into account that an African country maybe supporting 220 million people or possibly supporting a very large number of fishermen against another country which maybe supporting a 2 million3 million population and ten thousand fisherman, how can the de-minimis be the same for all sets of people,"" he added. India has also raised serious concerns on the proposed prohibition limited to only specific fuel subsidies and leaving out the non-specific fuel subsidies. In the total fisheries subsidies, the share of fuel subsidies is estimated to be around 22 per cent, which is mostly in the form of non-specific fuel subsidies. ""Leaving out disciplining non-specific fuel subsidies has no justification in the science of fisheries conservation,"" Goyal said. The exemption from disciplines for the low-income or resource-poor or livelihood fishing, particularly again for those nations not involved in long distance fishing up to EEZ (200 nautical miles), is highly essential to provide socio-economic security to these vulnerable communities, he said."
17,"Oil jumps 2% as tight supply outweighs recession, China demand fears",economy," Oil prices rose about 2% on Tuesday as tight global supply outweighed worries that fuel demand would be hit by a possible recession and fresh COVID-19 curbs in China. Brent crude futures rose $2.60, or 2.1%, to $124.87 a barrel at 1405 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.42, or 2% to $123.35 a barrel. Tight supply has been aggravated by a drop in exports from Libya amid a political crisis that has hit output and ports. Other OPEC+ producers are struggling to meet their production quotas and Russia faces bans on its oil over the war in Ukraine. ""The continuing squeeze on refined products globally, as well as a lack of investment to bring online more supplies from OPEC members, or other sources, means lost Russian production is nowhere near being covered by global markets,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, in a note. UBS raised its Brent price forecast to $130 a barrel for end-September and to $125 for the subsequent three quarters, up from $115 previously. ""Low oil inventories, dwindling spare capacity, and the risk of supply growth lagging demand growth over the coming months have prompted us to raise our oil price forecast,"" the bank said. Ratings agency Fitch raised its Brent and WTI price assumptions for 2022 by $5 to $105 and $100 a barrel, respectively. The market will be awaiting weekly U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday for a view of how tight crude and fuel supply remain. Six analysts polled by Reuters forecast U.S. crude inventories to have fallen by 1.2 million barrels last week, while gasoline stockpiles rose 800,000 barrels and distillate inventories, which include diesel and heating oil, were unchanged. On the demand side, China's latest COVID outbreak traced to a bar in Beijing has raised fears of a new phase of lockdowns just as restrictions in the country were being eased and fuel demand was expected to firm. In its monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries kept to its forecast that world oil demand will exceed pre-pandemic levels in 2022, but said Russia's invasion of Ukraine and developments related to the coronavirus pandemic pose a considerable risk. The group, however, sees demand growth slowing next year, OPEC delegates and industry sources told Reuters, as surging oil prices help drive up inflation and act as a drag on the global economy. Looking ahead, oil prices may face pressure if the U.S. Federal Reserve surprises markets with a higher-than-expected interest rate hike to tame inflation when it meets on June 14-15."
18,"Despite pandemic and lockdown, India's unemployment rate fell to 4.2% in 2020-21",economy," The coronavirus pandemic and the nationwide lockdown seemed to have had a little adverse impact on India's job market, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.2 percent in 2020-21 (July-June) according to the latest government data. As per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) for 2020-21 (July-June), released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on June 14, India's unemployment rate declined even as the labour force participation rate rose to 41.6 percent. In 2019-20 (July-June), the unemployment rate was 4.8 percent and the labour force participation rate was 40.1 percent. The fall in the unemployment rate and a rise in the labour force participation rate in the 12 months starting July 2020 is surprising as the first three months of this period saw the Indian economy contracting and enter into a technical recession. While GDP growth improved in subsequent months, it averaged 4.2 percent per quarter over the survey period, buoyed largely by a favourable base effect-fuelled 20.1 percent growth in April-June 2021. The PLFS is the only official source of employment-related data. It provides quarterly updates for urban areas and an annual report for urban and rural areas. Unemployment in the quarterly report for urban areas is measured as per the 'Current Weekly Status'. A person is considered unemployed in a week under this definition if they don't work even for an hour on any day despite being available for work at least for an hour on any day. The employment status is determined on the basis of a reference period of the last seven days preceding the date of the survey. The annual report estimates employment indicators using the Current Weekly Status and the 'Usual Status'. The Usual Status considers both the Usual Principal Status and the Subsidiary Status."
19,Exclusive| India won’t bend on new WTO global plan on food exports: sources,economy," Even as India becomes the central figure in a debate at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on a proposed plan to curb restrictions on food exports, the country will not yield to force, senior officials said. India is not willing to accept the plan when its right to stockpile foodgrains is still not accepted, and will not vote for it, they told Moneycontrol. The once-in-two-years mega meeting of trade ministers of all 164 WTO member nations, which legislates on global trade, is taking place in Geneva, Switzerland. In the aftermath of a global shortage of wheat due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, both major growers of the cereal, and unseasonal hot weather destroying crops, food security has become the central topic of discussion at the 12th Ministerial Conference of the WTO. On the third day of the summit, a proposed global declaration to not curb foodgrain exports to the World Food Programme (WFP), which seeks to fight hunger in places hit by conflicts, disasters and climate change, is one of the main items on the agenda. The declaration will be binding and goes against the demands of India to exercise its right to control its food exports. Officials also point out that this draft declaration does not mention public stockholding for food security purposes. “While many countries are concerned over a looming food crisis, India’s responsibility to provide food to its 800 million poor and vulnerable population will not be compromised upon,” a senior trade negotiator for India told Moneycontrol. India’s stance on the issue is being closely watched by almost all major economies as every decision at the WTO is taken unanimously and even a single dissenting voice can shut down the entire process. As of now, it seems India’s refusal may tank the proposal, backed by the overwhelming majority of WTO member nations. Decades-old battle India and other developing nations run major public stockholding programmes to purchase, stockpile and distribute foodgrains to people in need. Richer economies say some stockholding programmes are deemed to distort trade when they involve purchases from farmers at prices fixed by the governments such as India’s minimum support price programme. The WTO has a ""peace clause"" that permits uninterrupted implementation of India’s food security programme till a permanent solution is found. This allows the country to procure and stock foodgrains for distribution to the poor without being penalised by the trade body even if it breaches the 10 percent subsidy cap prescribed by it. For a permanent solution, India had earlier proposed either amending the formula to calculate the food subsidy cap of 10 percent, which is based on the reference price of 1986-88, or allowing such schemes outside the purview of the subsidy cap. Government speak There were huge concerns about food security during the COVID-19 pandemic. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on June 13 told the WTO that India can’t forgo the public distribution system (PDS) for foodgrains that it has built over the past 75 years. India distributed nearly 100 million tonnes of foodgrains through the PDS, thanks to the public stocks that it had acquired. It had allocated grains to nearly 800 million poor and vulnerable people for nearly the past 25 months at a cost of over $50 billion. This almost doubled the existing foodgrains being distributed to vulnerable sections of society under the National Food Security programme. “This has been universally recognised as one of the most comprehensive approaches to addressing hunger during the pandemic. In fact, several reports internationally suggest that this has helped bring down inequality amongst different sections of society,” Goyal said. Pressure on India India had proceeded to the summit with the support of poor and developing nations but as the risk of a food crisis has become more evident, it has lost allies. The proposal is being backed by a group of 70-80 countries led by Singapore. On June 13, a WTO spokesperson told a news conference in Geneva that most WTO members expressed broad support for the proposal, with the exception of India, Egypt and Sri Lanka. Previously hesitant Tanzania had decided to endorse the texts, the spokesperson added."

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Perhaps this extract from Lewis Carroll’s ‘Through the Looking Glass’ could throw some light on the current situation in the markets: “Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on the top of a high wall—such a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how he could keep his balance—and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction, and he didn’t take the least notice of her, she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all. ‘And how exactly like an egg he is!’ she said aloud, standing with her hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall. ‘It’s very provoking,’ Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking away from Alice as he spoke, ‘to be called an egg—Very!’………………… ‘To send all his horses and all his men,’ Alice interrupted, rather unwisely. ‘Now I declare that’s too bad!’ Humpty Dumpty cried, breaking into a sudden passion. ‘You’ve been listening at doors—and behind trees—and down chimneys—or you couldn’t have known it!’ ‘I haven’t, indeed!’ Alice said very gently. ‘It’s in a book.’ ‘Ah, well! They may write such things in a book,’ Humpty Dumpty said in a calmer tone. ‘That’s what you call a History of England, that is. Now, take a good look at me! I’m one that has spoken to a King, I am: mayhap you’ll never see such another: and to show you I’m not proud, you may shake hands with me!’ And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as she took it. ‘If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet behind,’ she thought: ‘and then I don’t know what would happen to his head! I’m afraid it would come off!’ ‘Yes, all his horses and all his men,’ Humpty Dumpty went on. ‘They’d pick me up again in a minute, they would!’” Will Humpty Dumpty fall off the wall? Will he be blown away by inflation? And if he does fall, will the king’s horses and men come to his rescue? Will they be able to put him together again? How on earth can horses put together an egg, or men for that matter? Is the king who made the promise to Humpty Greenspan the Great and does Humpty know he has since retired and Powell the Promise-Breaker is now king? Is the Indian Humpty Dumpty more stable and the wall he is sitting on broader? Is the reference to the Turk a not-so-subtle hint about the precarious state of the Turkish lira?

21,India's palm oil imports dip 33% in May: SEA,economy," India's palm oil imports declined by 33.20 per cent to Rs 5,14,022 tonne during May this year, but there was sharp rise in shipment of RBD palmolein oil by refineries, industry body Solvent Extractors Association (SEA) said on Tuesday. India, the world's leading vegetable oil buyer, imported 7,69,602 tonnes of palm oils in May 2021. The country's total vegetable oil imports declined to Rs 10,05,547 tonne in May this year, compared to 12,13,142 tonne in the year-ago period. The share of palm oil is about 50 per cent of the country's total vegetable oil imports. According to the SEA, Indonesia has lifted the ban on export of palm oil with some conditions from May 23 and also reduced export tax. This will increase exports from Indonesia and have a dampening effect on global prices. Among palm oil products, import of crude palm oil (CPO) declined to 4.09 lakh tonnes in May this year, from 7.55 lakh tonnes in the year-ago period, as per the SEA data. However, the import of RBD palmolein rose sharply to 1 lakh tonnes from 2,075 tonnes, while that of crude palm kernel oil (CPKO) declined to 4,265 tonnes from 11,894 tonnes in the said period. Among soft oils, the import of soyabean oil increased sharply to 3.73 lakh tonnes in May this year, as against 2.67 lakh tonnes in the same period of the previous year. Whereas import of sunflower oil fell marginally to 1.18 lakh tonnes, as against 1.75 lakh tonnes in the said period. According to the SEA, edible oils stock as on June 1 this year, was estimated to have been at 4.84 lakh tonnes and about 17.65 lakh tonnes was in the pipeline."
22,Fitch expects RBI to raise interest rates to 5.9% by December-end,economy," Fitch Ratings on Tuesday said the Reserve Bank is likely to raise interest rates further to 5.9 per cent by December 2022, on deteriorating inflation outlook. In its update to Global Economic Outlook, Fitch said India's economy faces a worsening external environment, elevated commodity prices, and tighter global monetary policy. ""Given the deteriorating outlook for inflation, we now expect the RBI to lift rates further to 5.9 per cent by December 2022 and to 6.15 per cent by the end of 2023 (vs. previous forecast of 5 per cent) and to be unchanged in 2024,"" Fitch said. Last month in an unscheduled policy announcement, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised rates by 40 basis points to 4.4 per cent, and subsequently to 4.9 per cent last week. The RBI has forecast inflation to be 6.7 per cent by the end of current fiscal. The retail inflation for May came in at 7.04 per cent. ""Inflation has risen to an eight-year high and broadens across more CPI categories, posing a severe challenge to consumers. In the past three months, food inflation has increased by an average of 7.3 per cent year-on-year, while healthcare bills are rising at a similar pace,"" Fitch said. According to Fitch, the April-June quarter growth is likely to improve on a rebound in consumption as COVID-19 cases subsided towards end-March. ""GDP grew by 4.1 per cent year-on-year in 1Q22 (January-March) compared to our March forecast of 4.8 per cent. We now expect the economy to grow by 7.8 per cent this year (2022-2023), revised down from our previous forecast of 8.5 per cent,"" Fitch said. Fitch had last week upped outlook on India's sovereign rating to 'stable' from 'negative' after two years citing diminishing downside risks to medium-term growth on rapid economic recovery. The rating was kept unchanged at 'BBB-'. ""The Outlook revision reflects our view that downside risks to medium-term growth have diminished due to India's rapid economic recovery and easing financial sector weaknesses, despite near-term headwinds from the global commodity price shock,"" it said. The Indian economy grew 8.7 per cent in the last fiscal and RBI expects growth to be 7.2 per cent this fiscal."
23,Market mispricing of risk will continue,economy," John Plender

“Monetary policy normalisation” is a wonderfully reassuring phrase. It seems to hint that the mispricing of risk that has characterised markets since the financial crisis may soon be a thing of the past.

Maybe it even suggests that the curtain will come down on the misallocation of capital that has resulted from central banks’ ultra-low interest rates, a significant contributory factor in the developed world’s dismal productivity record since 2008. But think again. There are good grounds for thinking..."
24,"WPI inflation hits new high in May, rises to 15.88%",economy," India's inflation based on the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) hit a fresh high in May, rising to 15.88 percent, according to data released by the commerce ministry on June 14. WPI inflation was 15.08 percent in April 2022 and 13.11 percent in May 2021. Another 10 percent-plus print in May means WPI inflation has extended its stay in double-digit territory to 14 months in a row. The sharp rise in wholesale inflation in May comes a day after the statistics ministry said Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation dropped to 7.04 percent last month - albeit thanks to a favourable base effect - from a 95-month high of 7.79 percent in April. At 15.88 percent, the WPI inflation print for May is the highest in the current series, data for which is available starting April 2013. As such, the latest wholesale inflation number is the highest in at least nine years. Economists had compared data from older WPI series and found inflation in April to be the highest in 30 years. As such, the even-higher May print is the highest in at least three decades. Inflation was driven higher in May by a sequential increase in prices across the board. The overall all-commodities index of the WPI rose 1.4 percent month-on-month, while the index for primary articles rose 2.8 percent. Within primary articles, the index for food articles rose 2.4 percent from April, with price momentum particularly strong for vegetables (up 18.5 percent month-on-month). The index for the fuel and power group was 2.3 percent higher in May compared to April, while that for manufactured products – which account for 64.23 percent of the WPI basket – rose 0.6 percent. While the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy target is spelt out in terms of CPI inflation, wholesale prices hold clues for the future trajectory of retail prices."

0,Extend GST compensation to states for next 3-5 years: Amit Mitra urges Nirmala Sitharaman,economy," Former West Bengal minister Amit Mitra has written to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, urging her to continue with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation to states for another 3-5 years after this month. Mitra, the principal chief advisor to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and the state finance department, said the extension of the compensatory arrangement will provide a big relief to the states. We note with dismay and ominous signs that the Centre has decided to withdraw the goods and services tax (GST) compensation to the states from July 2022. Such a decision, if taken, is completely contrary to what was envisaged at the time of adoption of GST, Mitra wrote in the two-page letter on Monday. He claimed that all states, across all political parties, decided to adopt GST on the condition that the Centre would compensate them for revenue loss for five years. You will appreciate that in 2016 when the said decision was made, none of us could have predicted that the world would be hit by the Covid pandemic of this magnitude. Nor could we have guessed that the economy of the world and of course, that of India, would under be unprecedented stress, due to this pandemic, he said in the letter to Sitharaman. Mitra, the then finance minister of West Bengal, was also the chairperson of an empowered committee of finance ministers that met in Kolkata on June 14, 2016, to deliberate on whether the GST could be adopted by the states and the Centre. ""It so happened that I was then the chairperson of the empowered committee of finance ministers of states, which took this landmark decision. Subsequently, the then union finance minister and I, on behalf of all the states, made the announcement before the media about our unanimous agreement on GST compensation to the states for five years,"" he mentioned. Mitra also said the complete lockdown followed by partial restrictions during the last three years has severely undermined the basis of the decision of the empowered committee taken in 2016. ""I hope you will agree that it would be most logical to continue to provide GST compensation to the states for the next 3 to 5 years beyond June 2022 to provide much-needed relief to the state finances,"" he said in the letter. The former West Bengal finance minister also said the unforeseen battle against the pandemic has put the fiscal health of the states under huge stress. The former West Bengal finance minister also said the unforeseen battle against the pandemic has put the fiscal health of the states under huge stress. The impact of the pandemic continues to adversely affect our economy. The supply chain in manufacturing, services and agriculture is still broken. The MSME sector is struggling to survive and the informal/unorganised sector, which provides unemployed employment to more than 90 per cent of the labour force, remains severely fractured, Mitra stated. On top of that, the massive inflationary pressures have severely aggravated and impaired the economics of states, he said. The GDP has not yet reached the pre-pandemic levels and is not likely to reach a desirable trajectory anytime soon, Mitra added."
1,Rupee at 80 for a dollar: This derivative sets a one-year time frame,economy,"  The rupee has depreciated 5 percent so far in 2022 and there are no prizes to predict that the losing streak will last longer. The rupee’s weakening trend is a direct fallout of dollar outflows triggered by a fast-tightening US Federal Reserve. At such a time, it is pertinent to track the offshore non-deliverable forward rate for the dollar/rupee pair. NDF is a forward contract where the trader has the choice but not the obligation to deliver the underlying currency. In other words, NDF is a pure punt derivative instrument and predicts how an exchange rate may fare in the future. If offshore NDF rates for the dollar/rupee pair are to be believed, the Indian currency is expected to weaken closer to 79 to its US counterpart in three months. What’s more is that the rupee could touch a low of 80 per dollar in a year’s time. To be sure, NDF rates tend to over-influence and overpower the domestic spot exchange rate during times of depreciation. Indeed, the difference between the onshore spot exchange rate and that of the three-month offshore NDF rate widens during depreciation episodes. This gap has widened to roughly 80 paise now from about 70 paise on average last month."
2,Banking | Coming Soon: The battle for deposits,economy," Demonetisation in November 2016 was a challenge for many businesses, especially the small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It was, however, a boon for banks that saw a large growth in their deposits. Cash stashed away by households found its way into bank accounts. From 2015 onwards, industrial credit slowed down very sharply to hit a several decades low of around 5 percent in 2017, and after a blip up in 2018, continued slowing down. This trend of deposit growth being higher than credit growth goes back to the financial year 2015. Deposits growth remained at double digit throughout this period. With deposit growth at double digit, and credit growth between 5 and 7 percent, banks were floating on easy liquidity. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) unleashed additional liquidity and policy rate cuts that saw them hit all-time lows. For bank managers, the real challenge in the last five years was finding credit growth, and managing the impact of the pandemic on credit quality and on the organisation. For almost eight years, growing deposits was not a challenge. This easy period of deposits for banks is coming to an end, and in the next couple of quarters we are likely to see the beginning of an intense competition for deposits. The RBI is on a clear and aggressive path of rate hikes and liquidity squeezing. The May and June policy rate hikes by the RBI’s MPC will be followed by similar hikes in August and September. Higher rates will ultimately be transmitted by banks on both sides of the balance sheet — in the pricing of loans, and deposits. In the past, increasing policy rates were beneficial for banks as the transmission was asymmetric — quicker and larger for loans than that for deposits. In this cycle, it is likely to be different, and we may see sharper pricing up for deposits than loans. This relatively larger and quicker rate transmission on the deposit side will be driven by four factors. First, credit growth will remain strong. While consumer credit will slow down due to higher interest rates, the demand for working capital from business will remain strong. Rising commodity prices are driving working capital demand as the cost of inventory has gone up. There are some early signs of capex revival which may further drive credit demand. After nearly five years, we are seeing credit growth in double digits. The policy of withdrawal of liquidity along with high credit growth will mean that the demand for deposits will increase. Second, households are facing serious inflation that will dent savings. In addition to cost-of-living increases, households will see increase in the costs of borrowing. Over the last seven years as the industrial credit growth stagnated, banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have lent freely to households, and these consumer loans now form a larger share of the banks’ loan book than industrial credit. This expansion of consumer credit has been primarily in the top two income deciles of households which also are the biggest contributors to household savings. From 2019, regulations have mandated the interest rate on all the consumer loans to be linked to external benchmark such as the repo rate or T-bill yields. These loans will, therefore, be priced sharply upwards. In case of longer maturity loans such as home loans, lenders will try to keep the monthly payments constant by extending the maturity of the loans. However other loans that constitute nearly 50 percent of consumer borrowing, such as personal (unsecured loans), vehicle loans, etc. will all see increase monthly repayments. The net effect of these rate hikes will be that households that contribute most to the banking deposit base will see their net savings (savings after loan repayments) shrink significantly. Third, as the rate cycle peaks around October/November, debt mutual funds will become a very attractive alternative to investors. The yields on five-year AA corporate bonds have already started inching closer to 10 percent, and with the forthcoming policy rate hikes these yields will further go up. High-quality corporate bonds funds comprising AAA and AA rated papers, could start delivering double-digit yields as the rate cycle peaks. This would entice high network individuals (HNIs) and institutional depositors to move their money from deposits to these funds. Bear in mind that funds, held over three years, provide a sizeable tax advantage over deposits. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a very rapid increase in the adaption of digital tools — mobile apps especially – to conduct banking transactions. Thanks to these tools, opening new accounts and moving money between them is way easier now than was the case even three years ago. These tools, thus, make deposits much more fungible than before. It is much easier to woe a depositor by offering a higher rate than was the case just a few years ago. Digital technologies have also made it much easier now to move money from deposits to mutual funds. The net effect of these factors is that the deposit market is now much more contestable. It is also important to note that over the last five years, several new players – the small finance banks and payment banks – have entered as competitors for deposits. Even the handful of deposit-taking NBFCs that have not focused much on raising retail deposits in an era where wholesale funding from banks and bond markets was very aplenty and cheap, would become active and aggressive in raising deposits. Intensifying competition for deposits will mean that the cost of deposits will go up, and it will dent margins, unless the cost hike is passed on to the borrowers. Given the nascence of credit growth, it seems unlikely that there will be full pass through of deposit rate increases to loans. Bank margins will come down. After a long time, bankers will realise that theirs in a unique business that must compete on both sides of the balance sheet. They will have to get ready to face something they haven’t for a very long time: intense competition for deposits."
3,The lesson for RBI from the Dhanlaxmi Bank fiasco,economy," Power plays and turf wars are commonplace in businesses and in a largely relationship-based business such as banking, turf wars shouldn’t surprise anybody.

The case in point is Dhanlaxmi Bank which has been embroiled in a tussle between the board, management, and shareholders for more than two years now.

5,Why India needs a fiscal council right now,economy," Tough times call for difficult measures to ensure a better future. As India grapples with the fallout of the pandemic and geopolitical turmoil on its finances, the country needs to create an independent fiscal council that will bolster its budgetary performance and improve economic forecasting. While the large spike in budget deficits since the pandemic hit are an aberration, the government’s fiscal marksmanship has often been off the mark. Fiscal targets have seldom been met and estimations of nominal growth and revenue have typically been over-optimistic. In recent years, however, these numbers have been underestimated. The perfect storm of global monetary tightening, higher inflation and supply-side disruptions means that the sovereign will need to keep spending more for a while to come. As such, there is a pressing need for an external and independent scrutiny of the government’s economic forecasts and its budget projections. About 50 countries have fiscal councils, which act as budgetary watchdogs, raising the reputational and electoral costs of undesirable policies and broken commitments by governments. These councils assess the sovereign’s budget plans and performance, evaluate macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts, and monitor the implementation of fiscal rules, according to the International Monetary Fund. In India, successive Finance Commissions have recommended the formation of a fiscal council but governments have rejected the proposals. The establishment of a fiscal council with powers to access records from the Union and state governments was one of the key recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission. The commission said there were institutional gaps in the production, collation, coordination and publication of fiscal data, as well as an independent review of fiscal projections and the medium-term budgetary framework across all levels of government. Shape of the new body A fiscal council must be independent, non-partisan and underpinned by a clear legal framework that gives it a statutory footing, according to the 15th Finance Commission’s report. Provisions must also be made with respect to its leadership, resources, mandate, functions, publications, and access to information. On where the fiscal council can be housed, there are a few options. While the US Congressional Budget Office has legal separation from the executive and lawmakers, the UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility is responsible to both the executive and the parliament. About 33 percent of fiscal councils are independent bodies based in parliaments. It is uncommon for fiscal councils to be housed within the executive, in national audit offices, or central banks, according to the 15th Finance Commission. What the fiscal council should do Provide multi-year macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts: In India, the government and central bank issue official economic forecasts. While the finance ministry’s economic survey projects real growth for the next financial year, the budget assumes a nominal GDP growth on the basis of which it makes projections for its revenue, expenditure, and fiscal deficit targets for the year. The central bank also estimates growth and inflation, typically over a nine-to-12-month horizon. Another non-partisan assessment will provide robustness to policymaking in India. Evaluate fiscal performance: Right now, the Central government gets a free pass when it misses budget gap targets. So do the states. A fiscal council’s independent evaluation of budget outcomes would keep a check on fiscal profligacy. Several fiscal councils across the world also provide recommendations on fiscal policies to inform the public debate. Assess long-term fiscal sustainability: While the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Review Committee recommended that both the Central and states governments must bring down their debt-to-GDP ratios, these targets have been roiled by the record fiscal expansion during the pandemic. Governments also often disregarded concerns raised by rating companies, especially when such commentary is not favourable. An independent assessment by a fiscal council could go a long way in keeping a check on government spending, especially in the good times. Assess fiscal policy statements and costing of new measures: A fiscal council will bring in external assessment of whether fiscal targets are being met or missed and warn about the impact of new schemes that could result in the ballooning of expenditure. Why now? According to Lekha Chakraborty, professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, an autonomous research institute under the ministry of finance, fiscal transparency and accountability are needed for the market to have confidence in a high public debt regime. “Constituting a Fiscal Council in India is, therefore, crucial at this juncture to analyse the fiscal risks and to formulate post-pandemic fiscal strategies to ensure fiscal credibility in times of geopolitical uncertainties,” Chakraborty wrote in an article. The Covid-19 pandemic and the current geopolitical as well as economic uncertainties present a good opportunity for the government to do some much needed housekeeping. India’s finance ministry has already used the pandemic-era budgets to clear liabilities like dues of the Food Corporation of India and started declaring public sector borrowings as part of the budget documents. Also read: The Big Recalculation: Fiscal deficit at 6.9% likely in FY23 after excise duty cuts, lower RBI surplus Still, it faces an uphill task as the debt-to-GDP ratio is estimated to remain elevated despite solid medium-term growth prospects. Also, global monetary tightening means higher interest costs. Note that the government pays about one-fourth of its revenue as interest. All this means that the overall fiscal metrics may be strained for several years, keeping borrowing costs in the economy higher for longer."
6,WTO should allow food exports from public stock to help countries in need: Piyush Goyal,economy," India strongly suggested the WTO to permit exports of food grains from public stocks for international food aid and for humanitarian purposes, especially on government-to-government basis, as the UN's World Food Programme was not able to ramp up its supplies to help needy nations. During an agri intervention in a WTO session, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said that the World Food Programme (WFP) over the last few years has demonstrated its inability to really ramp up supplies to the countries in distress. The United Nation's World Food Programme works in over 120 countries and territories to supply life-saving food to people displaced by conflict or made destitute by disasters. Citing data, the minister said that in 2020-21, the WFP programme can only procure 4.47 million tonnes at a cost of about USD 1.7 billion, which by itself is grossly inadequate to serve in the interest of humanitarian crisis or a problem that is faced by many countries in terms of their food security. He added that countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan need food supplies. India has food grain in its public stock holding programme, which can be used to help friendly neighbours, countries in distress, least developed nations and the poor and the vulnerable sections of society. ""I fail to understand what is holding back the WTO and its members from allowing government-to-government purchases for humanitarian purposes, in the event of a problem, in the event of food security being threatened. All of that (supplies) can be (done) on very transparent terms,"" Goyal said. ""We believe that the WFP by itself has hardly contributed to world food security in any significant way. Their limitations of the programme and other than trying to tell the world that the WTO and its members have done something truly for addressing the concerns of world food security, it's not going to significantly change the scenario,"" he added. He added that there are many countries which have public stock holding which could immediately provide relief to their neighbours, to other countries in distress. Due to this, India has proposed that ""we carve out an exemption for government-to-government purchases between countries so that we can support other countries particularly during humanitarian crises,"" the minister added. He also expressed concerns that the issue of finding a permanent solution to the issue of Public Stock Holdings (PSH) of grains for food security purposes."
7,"RBI much ahead in containing inflation, but two more rate hikes likely, says SBI report",economy," The Reserve Bank is much ahead of the curve in containing inflation, which appeared to have peaked, though it may go for an interest rate hike in August and October, according to an SBI research report. After rising to a 95-month (almost 8 years) high of 7.79 per cent in April, Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation moderated to 7.04 per cent in May. Core CPI also moderated in May to 6.09 per cent compared to 6.97 per cent in April, as per the SBI's research report 'Ecowrap'. ""In recent times, there have been commentaries that have questioned whether RBI has been behind the curve in controlling inflation. ""We believe RBI is much ahead of the curve in controlling inflation and the Fed can borrow a template from RBI to control US inflation that is all-pervasive and threatens to rip apart global financial stability,"" it said. The report has been authored by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, State Bank of India. The report further said there are expectations that the RBI could factor in a rate hike in August (as inflation in June is likely to come above 7 per cent) and even in October policy, and take it higher than the pre-pandemic level by October to 5.5 per cent. ""Our peak rate at the end of the cycle now has now a higher probability of a lower bound of 5.5 per cent and a lower probability of going up to 5.75 per cent, depending on inflation trajectory,"" the report said. It, however, added that this is purely data-dependent and subject to revisions. The RBI raised the short-term lending rate by 40 basis points in May and 50 basis points in June, taking the repo rate to 4.9 per cent to tame stubbornly high inflation. ""Our average inflation forecast for 2022-23 is 6.7 per cent but our quarterly inflation numbers are slightly different from RBI. ""The best thing is that the peak of inflation may have been reached at 7.8 per cent, with a little bit of luck,"" it added. Earlier this month, the RBI revised upwards its inflation projection to 6.7 per cent for the current fiscal from its previous forecast of 5.7 per cent. The central bank expects the first quarter inflation at 7.5 per cent; the second quarter at 7.4 per cent; the third quarter at 6.2 per cent; and the fourth quarter at 5.8 per cent, with risks, evenly balanced."
8,Domestic institutional investors pump record Rs 2 trillion into equity market so far this year,economy,"  Investments by domestic institutional investors (DIIs) in the Indian stock market crossed the Rs 2 trillion mark, so far in 2022. With still six-and-a-half months to go in the year of 2022, investments by DIIs in the equity market is the highest ever in a single calendar year. Analysts say that investors have been taking advantage of the correction in the market, that has been feeling the jitters over rising inflation, surging crude oil prices and geo-political tensions. Further, DIIs have been net buyers (they bought more equities than they sold) for 16 consecutive months even as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been net sellers. “Domestic flows are coming to the market as people are shifting from physical assets and investing heavily in financial assets. The number of demat accounts and mutual fund investors have grown manifold in the past couple of years. Rising interest rate always poses a risk to equity investment to some extent. It may (negatively) impact a small portion of SIPs (systematic investment plans), going ahead. However, India’s growth story remains intact, and we expect Indian equity to deliver double-digit returns over the next one to two years. Therefore, domestic inflows will remain strong,"" said Mitul Shah - Head of Research at Reliance Securities. According to a Jefferies India report, Indian households save about Rs 53 trillion annually, and at the current rate of equity allocation in household savings (4.80 percent), the incremental annual equity allocation works out to Rs 2.52 trillion. Of this, the annual contribution through SIPs in mutual funds alone stands at over Rs 1.44 trillion. In addition, approximately Rs 25,000-30,000 crore is being invested in equity markets by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) as part of its 15 percent allocation to equity market. A recent news report suggested that the government is now proposing to gradually increase the allocation by EPFO to 20 percent. If this proposal goes through, that would mean more money flowing into Indian equity markets. However, data from banks and insurance companies regarding their net investment in equity markets is not available. “These institutions have to deploy the monies received by them into the intended funds, with a little leeway about raising or cutting their cash holdings. As long as the net flows are positive, they have to keep investing in the markets,” said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities.  According to brokerage firm Reliance Securities, India is better placed compared to most other nations for attracting investments. Besides, events in China, such as the spread of COVID-19, and regulatory clampdown on businesses such as fintech firms have led global as well domestic investors to put their China investments on hold and to focus more on other emerging economies, mainly India. This too, say analysts, is the key catalyst for higher growth, which would continue, going forward. Though DII flows would moderate due to monetary tightening, analysts expect inflows to continue in FY23. Akhil Chaturvedi, Chief Business Officer, Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company (MOAMC), says this counterbalancing impact of domestic flows reflected in relatively moderate volatility despite unprecedented FPI outflows. Meanwhile, FIIs sold $23.87 billion in domestic equities so far this year amid higher crude that continues to stoke worries about higher inflation and fiscal deficit. So far this year, the Sensex and the Nifty have fallen nearly 9.2 percent each. The US Federal Reserve will meet on Wednesday, when it is expected to continue raising rates amid higher inflation, while Bank of Japan will conclude its two-day meeting on Friday."

10,Retail inflation for May matches estimates at 7.04%,economy," India's headline retail inflation rate eased to 7.04 percent in May from April's near-eight-year high of 7.79 percent thanks to a favourable base effect, according to data released on June 13 by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The latest inflation print is along with consensus estimates. As per a Moneycontrol poll, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was seen falling to 7.1 percent in May. The fall in inflation in May is unlikely to do much to slow down the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) rate hike cycle. CPI inflation has now been above the RBI's medium-term target of 4 percent for 32 consecutive months. More worryingly, it has now spent five months above the 6 percent upper bound of the 2-6 percent tolerance range. Given the central bank's latest forecast, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is on track to fail to meet its mandate in October, when CPI data for September will be released. The MPC is deemed to have failed when average CPI inflation is outside the 2-6 percent tolerance band for three consecutive quarters. With inflation having averaged 6.3 percent in January-March, the RBI's forecast - if they hold - of 7.5 percent for April-June and 7.4 percent for July-September will see it fail by October. May internals The month-on-month increase was the largest for the two most volatile components - food and fuel. While the index for food and beverages rose 1.5 percent month-on-month in May, that of fuel and light was up 1.4 percent from April. Both the sequential price increases were as expected. Food prices - especially those of cereals, meat and fish, edible oils, and vegetables - rose in May due to the heat wave, shortages, and rising input costs. Out of the 22 food items on which the Department of Consumer Affairs compiles data, only three saw a month-on-month fall in prices in May. Meanwhile, the impact of the excise duty cut for petrol and diesel announced on May 21 is expected to be felt in the inflation data for June. Inflation dropped in May despite these upward pressures on account of an extremely favourable base effect. In May 2021, the general index of the CPI was 160.4—1.6 percent higher than the 157.8 seen in April 2021. This dwarfed the 0.9 percent rise posted by the index last month, helping pull down inflation sharply. The base effect also dragged down core inflation - or inflation excluding food and fuel. In May, this measure of inflation - seen as an indicator of underlying demand in the economy - plummetted to 6.2 percent from 7.0 percent in April. Future policy The RBI has increased the repo rate by 90 basis points so far in FY23 to 4.90 percent. And economists see it continuing to increase the policy rate in the next couple of meetings, with the key rate seen around 5.5-6.0 percent by the end of the financial year."
11,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Red-hot inflation is only adding to the investor woes,economy," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Investor hopes that inflation may have peaked have been shattered. Consumer prices in the US grew at the fastest pace in four decades in May, triggering a new set of worries. The fear is the US Federal Reserve will have to step up its inflation targeting measures to maintain economic stability. The US central bank had gone for a stronger-than-expected 50 basis points policy rate hike in May and it has guided for similar rate hikes in the upcoming meetings. Investors now fear faster policy tightening. “The market’s implied expectation as derived from Fed Funds futures is pricing in a 75-basis point hike in one of the coming meetings,” writes Anubhav Sahu in this piece. Before the May inflation print, a large section of the market participants was expecting the US Fed to end 2022 with a policy rate of 275-300 basis points. Post the inflation data, the proportion of investors who believe the US Fed Funds rate will reach 300-350 basis points by 2022-end has gone up considerably, explains Manas Chakravarty in today’s edition. Where does this leave India? Not in a pretty position. Rising risk-free returns will trigger portfolio reassessments at global funds. Despite weak economic conditions, the European Central Bank is set to hike interest rates. Investor appetite for cash burning business ventures has reduced, beginning this year. For India, the challenges are compounded by high energy prices and dependency on crude oil imports. If fuel prices rise further, then India’s macro-economic indicators such as inflation, gross fiscal deficit and current account deficit can deteriorate, posing risk to stock valuations. The concerns are visible in the Indian rupee, which hit a new low today. “As such, India’s macro-economic factors will weaken considerably in FY2023 versus pre-COVID levels,” warn experts at Kotak Institutional Equities. “Growth is an exception, but that would suffer at higher levels of oil prices as the government may not be in a position to shield consumers.” Amid the rate hikes gloom, there exists a belief that central banks, notably the US Fed, will not risk derailing the economy with harsh policy actions. After all, job creation and economic expansion are stated objectives. But with inflation so high, the US Fed has no option but to tighten liquidity.

12,"For effective financial inclusion, India needs a more inclusive, updated database",economy," The Reserve Bank of India’s Annual Report 2021-22 released last month has a stunning piece of new data showing an astounding rise in the aggregate number of Business Correspondents (BCs) in the country over the last year. While the number of BC outlets in villages increased from 1,194,640 in December 2020 to 1,844,732 in December 2021, the hike was more dramatic in urban areas from 324,507 to 1,412,529. The footnotes to Table IV.6 state that the data for December 2021 are provisional, and that “There is a significant increase in data reported by few private sector banks.” It is extremely surprising that the rise from 1.5 million BCs in India to 3.2 million in one year has been attributed to better data reporting by “few private sector banks”. It is also curious that no additional information is provided in the section. The issue of improved data metrics for financial inclusion has been flagged by many, including us at the Indicus Centre for Financial Inclusion (ICFI) for many years. Financial inclusion is a national policy objective, and in a large heterogeneous country like India, it is imperative that granular data is monitored regularly by the government and the RBI. The BCs are the mainstay of financial inclusion, accounting for more than 95 percent of the banking outlets in rural India, and play a critical role in ensuring that government welfare payments reach beneficiaries in villages. However, while the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) has ensured widespread access to banking, there are still some gaps on the ground. In a recent study by Dvara Research across seven states, almost 50 percent of respondents who had a problem during cash withdrawal of their government benefits cited ‘Cash-out point far away’ as their issue. Unless there is geographically granular data throwing a spotlight on specific locations that lack active outlets, such issues will go unaddressed, leading to grievances among beneficiaries. In March, the RBI announced the framework for geo-tagging payment system touch points, this should be used to identify the specific problem locations. While more than three-fourths of the PMJDY accounts have been opened by public sector banks, if a significantly large share of the BCs is with the private sector banks, as the latest RBI data seem to suggest, there are a number of implications for the ecosystem. For instance, it may be time to relook the current structure of interchange fees paid out by the account opening bank to the BC when a customer makes a transaction at an outlet/micro-ATM that does not belong to the account opening bank. As flagged by the SBI Ecowrap in November 2021, with the distribution of BCs skewed towards private sector banks and distribution of account opening banks skewed towards public sector banks, the latter are estimated to be paying out Rs 600-700 crore annually as interchange fees, even while they bear the costs of operation of the accounts. Correct data is key to an appropriate fee structure, which affects the operational viability of the entire network involved in welfare payouts and financial inclusion. Without viability, service quality is bound to be hit at the last mile. There is a wealth of information that the RBI can collate that can inform policy decisions as well as product and service offerings by industry. This includes data on active/dormant agents, usage of accounts, the quality of service/transactions, etc. Granular data on geographies is critical as mentioned above. The recent BCG-PhonePe Pulse report on digital payments has an excellent map showing the uneven adoption of digital payments across time in different states — this is the kind of analysis that the RBI can facilitate at the district level. Then there is long-pending ask for gender-disaggregated data. While the gender-gap and specific challenges that women face in accessing financial services are well known, there is no data available even on something as basic as the number of women BCs in India. In 2015, a recommendation proposed by ICFI was picked up by the RBI Committee on Medium Term Path for Financial Inclusion for “a unified, harmonised database of the financial inclusion footprint, in terms of outlets, service points, devices, connectivity and BC networks, aggregated and monitored by a single source” (Indicus Policy Brief November, 2015). The Indian Banks Association (IBA) was given the responsibility to set up an online BC registry. However, the database is not available in the public domain. Given the latest disclosure in the annual report, it appears that even this registry does not seem to be functioning as it was intended by the RBI. The Department of Financial Services set up a Working Group in December to identify the gaps in the BC ecosystem, the report is to be finalised.

13,"RBI May Slow Down Pace Of Hikes By Year-End, Says HSBC",economy," “RBI will not be that aggressive toward the end of the year because growth will begin to slow then and it is very conscious about the sacrifice ratio,” HSBC’s Chief India Economist Pranjul Bhandari said in an interview on Bloomberg TV Monday. “When you hike rates too much then it starts hurting growth.” India’s central bank has cumulatively raised rate by 90 basis points so far this year to tame prices that have stayed above its 6% ceiling since the beginning of the year. Data due later Monday is likely to show consumer prices gains staying above 7% in May due to high food and fuel costs. “A lot of the pass-through is still to happen,” she said, adding that price pressures will stay for the rest of the year. HSBC is expecting the RBI to take repo rate to 6% by the middle of the next year, from 4.9% now. Asia’s third largest economy had shown resilience on the back of pent-up demand after reopening from Covid, but rising prices risk hurting the nation’s nascent recovery. “The entire pent-up services demand doesn’t last forever. We are seeing the first signs of export slowing and that can hurt GDP growth if it continues,” Bhandari said. “The growth momentum right now is 9% but toward end of year it will be closer to 5%.” Meanwhile, the local currency rupee slid past 78 per dollar for the first time Monday as a global risk off spurred by expectations of aggressive Federal Reserve tightening weighed on emerging-market assets and stoked fears of more equity outflows. “It will have inflationary implications, but perhaps not very large,” Bhandari said. “The good thing is India still has a big stock of foreign exchange reserves. There are lot of buffers out there which is still providing some sort of stability to the rupee.” "
14,New data shows India grew 6.8% per year on average under both UPA and pre-pandemic NDA govts,economy," India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew at the same annual average rate during the terms of the United Progressive Alliance and National Democratic Alliance governments, at least until the coronavirus pandemic struck. According to new data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, India's GDP grew at an annual average rate of 6.8 percent from 2004-05 to 2013-14—the 10 years Manmohan Singh was the prime minister (PM). In the first six years of Narendra Modi's tenure as PM—before the pandemic struck and pushed India into a recession—India's GDP again grew by 6.8 percent on an average from 2014-15 to 2019-20. If the two pandemic-hit years of 2020-21 and 2021-22 are taken into account, the average GDP growth rate under Modi drops to 5.4 percent.  The recently-released annual GDP growth data stretches back to 1951-52. Until now, comparable growth rates for the current GDP series with 2011-12 as the base year was available only till 2005-06. The current GDP series, introduced by the statistics ministry in early 2015, attracted heavy criticism as it showed a big jump in growth even as high-frequency indicators painted a grimmer picture. For instance, the new series raised the GDP growth rate for 2013-14 to 6.9 percent from 4.7 percent under the previous series. This number has subsequently been revised down to 6.4 percent. The statistics ministry attributed the revision to a shift in focus to measuring value-addition based on a wider dataset of corporate earnings from volume-based growth in manufacturing. However, comparison across years was difficult as the new series only provided growth rates starting from 2012-13. This led to calls for a 'back series'. Back series controversy In July 2018, the Sudipto Mundle-led committee on real sector statistics, set up by the National Statistical Commission, said India clocked a growth of 10.8 percent in 2010-11 as per the new GDP series. This was higher than the 8.9 percent estimated under the old series. Further, the committee's estimates showed GDP growth averaged 8.0 percent per year during the 10 years of the Singh government as per the new series, while growth in Modi's first four years as PM averaged 7.3 percent per year. These numbers spilt over into the political arena, with the Congress saying the data proved ""like-for-like, the economy under both UPA terms outperformed the Modi govt (sic)"". However, a month later in August 2018, the statistics ministry said the GDP back series given by the committee on real sector statistics was not official but only ""experimental results"". The official GDP back series, released in November 2018, showed GDP grew 7.4 percent per year on average from FY15 to FY18. Meanwhile, the annual average GDP growth rate for the last nine years of Singh's tenure as PM was revised to 6.7 percent, leading to another outcry and accusations of political interference in the calculation of India's official statistics, especially with the 2019 general elections just around the corner. Full comparability The numbers now released (external link) by the statistics ministry allow comparisons to be made across several decades. Some of the striking highlights are as follows: >> The 6.6 percent contraction in the GDP in 2020-21 is the largest ever since 1951-52. The next worst year was 1979-80, when the GDP contracted by 5.2 percent. >> Since 1951-52, India's GDP has contracted on six occasions: by 6.6 percent in 2020-21, 5.2 percent in 1979-80, 2.6 percent in 1965-66, 0.6 percent in 1972-73, 0.4 percent in 1957-58 and 0.1 percent in 1966-67."

16,Economic thinking is at a crucial inflection point,economy," Martin Sandbu

Soaring energy prices have encouraged another form of inflation, this one rhetorical. Comparisons of our current challenges with the world’s economic and political struggles in the 1970s are now a dime a dozen.

The comparisons are apt as far as they go. Oil prices quadrupled in 1973 and doubled again in 1979. While they have “only” about doubled in the last two years, European gas prices have jumped five to 10-fold since before the pandemic. Overall inflation is the..."

Earlier, the US CPI reading for April had hinted towards a moderation in the inflationary trajectory. The US CPI increased by 0.3 percent month-on-month in April compared to 1.2 percent in March. However, the reading for May is one percent, quashing hopes that inflation is at a tipping point. On an annual basis, US CPI is 8.6 percent compared to Street expectations..."
18,"Indian rupee at a new low, 4 factors working against the currency",economy," India’s exchange rate has been hammered for the better part of this year and the rupee has been sinking to new lows. At roughly 78.20 to a dollar on June 13, another record low, the currency is 5 percent down since January. The root cause of the rupee’s distress can be found in elevated oil prices, as India meets almost 85 percent of its fuel needs through imports. The country’s crude oil basket price has risen to a decadal high to top $120 a barrel now. Elevated oil prices aren't the only enemy. Here are the four factors that are working against the rupee: 1 Foreign fund outflows The incessant dollar outflows from Indian equity and bond markets have kept the rupee under pressure in 2022. Depending on the intensity of the global risk-off sentiment, foreign institutional investors (FII) have pulled out more dollars every day from the domestic market. Since January, the outflow amounts to a whopping $24 billion. The weak sentiment is reflected in the sharp fall in benchmark equity indices as well. Both the Nifty and the 30-share BSE Sensex have dropped more than 10 percent since January. If the current momentum of dollar outflows continues, the exchange rate is likely to breach new lows, according to dealers. 2 Fed’s rate hike worries In response to the unprecedented retail inflation in the US, the Federal Reserve is expected to hike its policy rates fast and furious in the coming months. Markets are now factoring in a 75 basis points hike in the Federal Reserve meeting later this week. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Larger rate hikes by the Fed would increase the return on dollar assets compared with those of emerging markets such as India. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), too, is on a policy tightening path but the Fed’s larger rate hikes will lure money away from India. Local bond markets are particularly vulnerable to interest rate differentials. India’s bond market has been starved of dollars for the past one year, an indication of unfriendly FII sentiment. 3 The spectre of inflation Inflation seems to be the biggest enemy globally, with even advanced economies such as the US witnessing an unprecedented pace of price rise. US retail inflation surged to 40-year high of 8.6 percent in May, data showed last week. The persistent snags in global supply chains, worsened by the war between Russia and Ukraine, have meant that prices of goods and services are likely to stay elevated. India’s retail inflation rose to 7.79 percent in April and the finance ministry will release the print for May later in the day.  While inflation is expected to cool somewhat as suggested by a Moneycontrol poll, it would still be above 7 percent. Imported inflation along with domestic demand pressures portend to a prolonged period of price pressures. Since the same amount of goods and services require more money, the value of the currency needs to go down. To that extent, the rupee is expected to stay weak. 4 Current account deficit threat Yet another fallout of high global commodity prices is the widening of the current account deficit (CAD) for India. For Q3FY22, the CAD was 2.7 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), up from 1.3 percent in the preceding quarter.  Most economists expect the deficit to increase to 3-3.5 percent of the GDP for FY23. This could widen further if oil prices stay high or rise more. In the previous episode of external sector weakness in 2013, the CAD had risen to 5 percent of the GDP and India was lobbed with other vulnerable economies called the “Fragile Five”."
19,The A-to-Z of growth and inflation: 26 key terms you must know,economy," The world is stumbling from one economic crisis to another – one caused by a pandemic and the other by a military invasion. The impact of these events have been fully reflected in two key indicators: growth and inflation. Last week, the World Bank lowered its growth forecast for the global economy and warned of stagflation even if a recession is averted. What do these words mean? What does it mean when the Reserve Bank of India says it does not want ""inflation expectations"" to get ""unanchored""? And how can an economic recovery be described by letters of the alphabet? If such questions leave you scratching your head, you are in luck. Moneycontrol has put together 26 terms key to understanding the economic turmoil prevailing in India and the world. Annualised inflation: This is the percentage change in prices for a period compared to the same period of the previous year. It is calculated by comparing the respective index numbers, whether the Consumer Price Index or the Wholesale Price Index, for the two periods. India's inflation target, along that of other countries, is spelt out in these terms. Base effect: Since the inflation rate is arrived at by computing the percentage change, it is influenced by the denominator – or the base. If the index rose very sharply from April 2021 to May 2021, it may lead to inflation easing in May 2022 even if prices are higher than in April 2022. This is a favourable base effect. Core inflation: This measures inflation after excluding items whose prices are volatile – food and fuel, for instance. This measure of inflation is more stable than the headline number and is seen as an indicator of underlying demand. Depression: A fall in GDP for multiple years is termed a depression. A recession is commonly defined as at least two consecutive quarters of a year-on-year contraction in GDP – such as the one India experienced in the second and third quarters of 2020 following the imposition of a nationwide lockdown. Expectations: Anchoring the expectations of consumers and businesses on future inflation is key to ensuring price stability. Persistence of high inflation leads people to expect a faster rise in prices, which can be self-fulfilling; to pre-empt a rise in prices, consumers can bring forward their purchases, which then leads to higher prices because of increased demand. See this interview for a more detailed discussion on inflation expectations. Failure: This takes place when inflation is outside the RBI's 2-6 percent tolerance range for three consecutive quarters. In this event, the RBI must explain to the government the reasons for the failure, the remedial actions proposed, and an estimate of when inflation will return to the target range. Generalised inflation: This is when the increase in prices of a category of items – say fuel – leads to prices of other items also rising. For instance, higher fuel prices increase the cost of transporting food. This higher transportation cost can be recouped by increasing the price of food items, resulting in generalisation of inflation. Hyperinflation: This refers to a period of extremely high and increasing inflation. The most striking example is 1920s Germany, with inflation rising to almost 30,000 percent in late 1923 as prices doubled almost every four days. More recently, Zimbabwe has reported eye-watering levels of inflation, with the figure for May coming in at 131.7 percent. (shr)Inkflation: A little bit of cheating, perhaps, just like this term. Shrinkflation refers to the phenomenon of companies maintaining the price of their goods but reducing the quantity offered. So a packet of crisps continues to cost Rs 20, but now weighs 52 grams instead of 60 grams. Companies do this to avoid raising prices, which may weaken demand further and lead to loss of market share. This usually occurs when rising input costs put pressure on companies' margins. Jerome Powell: Powell is the chair of the US Federal Reserve System, the country's central bank. With the US experiencing the highest levels of inflation in 40 years, the speed with which Powell and his fellow rate-setters increase interest rates will have implications for the rest of the world. K-shaped recovery: This is what economists say India is currently experiencing, with different sections of the economy recovering at varying rates. For instance, the rich may have become richer following the pandemic as they could work from home. Meanwhile, the poor may have been rendered unemployed by the pandemic, depending on their jobs. Naturally, how these two sections emerge from the pandemic will be wildly different. Liquidity surplus/deficit: The level of money available in the banking system. During an economic crisis, central banks provide extra liquidity, as the RBI and other central banks have done during the pandemic. However, excess liquidity can lead to higher inflation as greater sums of money chase the same number of goods. Monetary Policy Report: This is a report the RBI is legally mandated to release every six months. The report, published in April and late September or early October every year, must detail the sources of inflation and inflation forecasts for the next 6-18 months. Nominal growth: GDP growth recorded without adjusting for inflation. As such, periods of high inflation will see high nominal growth. India's real GDP growth was 8.7 percent in FY22. But the high rate of inflation meant nominal growth was 19.5 percent. Output gap: The difference between how much an economy is currently producing and what it can potentially produce. If the output gap is negative, there is said to be spare capacity in the economy and a rise in demand will not necessarily lead to higher inflation. There is no precise measurement of output gap and it is usually derived from surveys. Price momentum: The month-on-month change in prices. Price momentum is positive when prices rise from one month to another, and vice versa. A change in the inflation rate from one month to another can be broken up into the price momentum and the base effect. Quarterly projection model: The RBI's system of forecasting inflation and growth, which informs monetary policy decisions. The model was updated in early 2021 to take into account the data up to the last quarter of 2019. Real policy rate: The policy rate adjusted for inflation. There are many ways to measure it – the current repo rate minus the prevailing inflation rate; the current repo rate minus one-year-ahead inflation forecast; or the current interest rate on one-year Treasury bills minus one-year-ahead inflation forecast. The RBI has used all three definitions at one point or another over the past eight years. The most acceptable seems to be the second one. Stagflation: A combination of stagnation and inflation, it refers to a period of low growth and high inflation. A classic example of stagflation is the 1970s. The World Bank has drawn comparisons between the current situation and the 1970s, citing the prolonged period of highly accommodative monetary policy in major advanced economies followed by persistent supply-side disturbances pushing inflation higher. Terminal rate: The level of policy rate consistent with stable inflation and full capacity utilisation. This level of policy rate is not fixed and can vary over time. Economists say the terminal repo rate for India may be 6-6.5 percent currently, suggesting a series of rate hikes in the coming months. Urjit Patel committee: The panel responsible for laying down India's current monetary policy framework. Led by former RBI governor Urjit Patel, the committee submitted its report (PDF, external link) in January 2014. V-shaped recovery: This represents a near-instantaneous recovery from a rapid decline. It was thought India's recovery from the pandemic would be V-shaped. Instead, it has been K-shaped. Wage-price spiral: This is the feedback loop that describes the impact of a rise in wages or prices on the other. For instance, higher wages lead to increased demand, which results in higher prices. This can lead to demand for higher wages to make up for a fall in real income. (e)Xchange rate pass-through: Some more cheating, but it's X! The exchange rate pass-through describes the extent to which domestic prices change due to exchange rate movements. According to a recent paper co-authored by RBI deputy governor Michael Patra, India's exchange rate pass-through has fallen from 15 percent to 8 percent, meaning a 1 percent change in the rupee-dollar exchange rate results in an 8-basis-point change in inflation. Yield curve: This is the line joining the yield-to-maturity for a category of securities – say government bonds – of various maturities. Securities maturing at a later date usually have a higher yield, and so the yield curve normally is upward sloping. During the pandemic, the RBI looked to exercise control over how the yield curve behaves, calling it a public good. The government's yield curve is important because it provides cues to securities of other issuers."
20,Chart of the Day | Asia’s inflation headwinds gathering force,economy," Inflation in Asia is picking up pace on the back of higher food and energy costs. With the share of food higher than in Europe/US and many countries being net food importers, the risks of a spike in food inflation are skewed to the upside, points out a monthly economic note by Nomura Global Economics. The chart alongside shows how much food and energy contribute to inflation and it’s evident that it’s relatively higher in Asia.

22,"Unfortunately, WTO could not respond with alacrity to control COVID-19 pandemic: Piyush Goyal",economy," India ramped up its supplies of medical products to different countries to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, but the WTO could not react with alacrity and the members need to bow their heads in ""shame"" for their inability to respond in time, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Sunday here. He said that the member countries of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have let down the people of the LDCs (least developed countries) and developing nations. ""My country ramped up supplies of medical products to provide medical and health items globally. Unfortunately, the WTO could not respond with alacrity. We have let down the people of the LDCs and developing countries. The rich countries need to introspect! We need to bow our heads in shame for our inability to respond to the pandemic in time,"" he said. Goyal is leading the Indian delegation for the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC) of the WTO. MC is the highest decision-making body of the WTO, and it is meeting after a gap of over four years. The meeting is being held in the backdrop of the Ukraine-Russia war and the global food and energy crisis. He said the pandemic reinforced the importance of 'One Earth One Health', calling for global solidarity and collective action. The minister also said India strongly believes that the WTO should not negotiate rules on non-trade-related subjects like climate change and gender, which legitimately fall within the domain of other inter-governmental organisations. COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. The pandemic has reinforced once again the need and efficacy of food stockholding for the public good, he added. A permanent solution to the issue of public food stocks, which has already been delayed, should be the topmost priority for MC-12 before the members of the WTO move to new areas. ""Nothing is more important than this for the people of the world,"" he noted. On the proposed agreement on fisheries subsidies, the minister said the right to life and livelihood of traditional fishermen cannot be curtailed in any manner. On the contrary, he said, those nations responsible for depleted fish stock should assume responsibility, having exploited the oceans for far too long by giving subsidies."
23,$5 trillion economic goal achievable by 2026; Chidambaram's view very wrong: Rajeev Chandrasekhar,economy," Union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar on Sunday termed ""very wrong"" senior Congress leader P Chidambaram's statement that the goal of a USD 5 trillion GDP appears to be a case of ""shifting goalposts"" as the original target year was 2023-24. Speaking to reporters here in Maharashtra, the MOS for Electronics and Information Technology and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship said India has become a USD 3 trillion economy and will become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2026. Reacting to Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran's remarks that IMF has forecast the Indian economy to cross USD 5 trillion by 2026-27, Chidambaram has said that the ""goal of a USD 5 trillion GDP appears to be a case of 'shifting goalposts'"". ""Chidambaram can suggest that we follow the US economic model. He will say anything and what he has said is his personal view which is a very, very wrong view. He was wrong before and has been continuously wrong. There is a phrase for (such) people who were caught with their hand in the cookie jar,"" Chandrasekhar said. He said the goal of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy by 2026 is achievable. ""We had set this goal before the coronavirus pandemic began. Now we have become a USD 3 trillion economy. By 2026, we will become a USD 5 trillion economy. The important component is India's post-COVID growth as an exporting nation and digital manufacturer. After post-COVID opportunities, a USD 5 to 10 trillion dollar dream can come true with the same pace of work,"" the minister said. When asked about Congress planning nationwide protests against summons issued by the ED to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her MP son Rahul Gandhi, he questioned the need to bring in ""mobs"" when the law is taking its course."

0,"To rebuild trust, credibility, we must first address mandated issues: Piyush Goyal to WTO",economy," India on Sunday said that to rebuild trust and credibility of the WTO, member countries must first address mandated issues, like the permanent solution to public stockholding, which was agreed nearly a decade ago. ""The current global food crisis is a reminder to us that we act now! Can we risk the lives of millions of people dependent on food stocks maintained for the poor and vulnerable?"" asked commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal here. He said that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the inability of the world to promptly respond to any crisis, whether on food security or health, economic wellbeing or open supply chains. ""To rebuild trust and credibility, we must first address mandated issues, like the permanent solution to public stockholding agreed nearly a decade ago,"" he added. Meanwhile, a source said that there is a discussion in the WTO (World Trade Organisation) on issuing a declaration that says countries will not impose export restrictions on the procurements made by WFP (World Food Programme). About 81 countries have sponsored this declaration. In all official documents of WFP, it has stated that it has problems with funding; it has never mentioned it has an issue with export restrictions. ""Since most of the procurements and delivery of WFP are in the developing countries, the unconnected countries calling for a decision on export restrictions is very strange,"" the source said. India is not in favour of giving binding commitment under the WTO on supply of food grains to the UN's World Food Programme as it would restrict its policy space to deal with domestic food security concerns."

The cut translated into a reduction of Rs 9.5 a litre for petrol in Delhi and Rs 7 a litre for diesel. Petrol in Delhi now costs Rs 96.72 a litre as against Rs 105.41 a litre before, while diesel costs Rs 89.62 a litre as opposed to Rs 96.67 earlier. In Mumbai, one litre of petrol costs Rs 111.35 and diesel Rs 97.28. In Chennai, petrol and diesel prices are Rs 102.63 and Rs 94.24 per litre, respectively. In Kolkata, petrol is Rs 106.03, and diesel is Rs 92.76 per litre. Oil marketing companies are passing on the excise duty cut to consumers despite incurring a loss of Rs 13.08 a litre on petrol and Rs 24.09 on diesel.

2,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender | The Outlook for Growth ,economy," Dear Reader, Going by the governor’s statement on monetary policy, the RBI seems remarkably bullish on growth in the Indian economy. Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “The recovery in domestic economic activity remains firm, with growth impulses getting increasingly broad based.” He further said both urban and rural demand is improving. The recovery in contact-intensive services will increase urban demand, while good monsoons will lift rural consumption. Even investment demand, he said, is making a comeback, as seen in capital goods imports and on the back of higher capacity utilisation, the government’s capex push and deleveraged corporate balance sheets. A look at RBI’s quarterly GDP projections, though, paints a rather different picture. Real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of FY23 is predicted to be 4 percent. That’s on top of a tepid 4.1 percent growth in Q4 of FY22, when the Omicron wave was rampant. It’s hardly a prediction of robust growth. In fact, we had a lively debate this week in the MC Pro pages on inflation, the rate hikes and growth. In the run-up to the monetary policy, for instance, my colleague Aparna Iyer rooted for a big rate hike, while M&M chief economist Sachchidanand Shukla cautioned that RBI should be mindful about the impact of rate hikes on growth. The reactions to the 50-basis point hike in the repo rate were similarly varied. While this story said a laser focus on inflation control is essential, another questioned whether rate hikes would be effective in combating supply-side inflation, while this one said curbing inflation is essential for long-term growth and good for the markets. Yet another article worried about the impact on bond yields. And this piece asked whether the central bank will be able to maintain the precarious balance between controlling inflation and supporting growth. The debate about growth isn’t just an academic discussion, but has enormous implications for earnings and the outlook for stocks. My colleague Anubhav Sahu, for example, said, “In the next few quarters, there is a potential risk of earnings downgrades due to demand destruction.” With the opening up of the contact-intensive sectors, Lemon Tree Hotels could be a key beneficiary. The return of investment demand is seen from NHPC’s expansion plans. Renu Sud Karnad, MD, HDFC, pointed out in an interview to MC Pro that home loan rates are still below their pre-pandemic levels. Indeed, DLF is getting ready to ride the realty upcycle. This non-bank micro-lender is the best play on the recovery in microfinance. Metro Brands is aggressively expanding its footprint. Gabriel India sees a pick-up in demand across segments while Minda Corp has a strong order pipeline. There are other positive indicators. Our Economic Recovery Tracker shows that June has begun on a strong note. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector is the highest in the past two years. The infrastructure push has led to a flurry of activity in the cement sector. And there are signs that inflation is peaking, with the FAO food price index falling for the second successive month. On the other hand, there are also plenty of negative cues. The RBI consumer survey showed that buyers are looking to cut down discretionary consumption. Nielsen data showed that consumers are cutting back sharply their buying of non-food FMCG items. Our Monsoon Watch flagged the weak start to the rains. And execution issues continue to dog the country’s infrastructure ambitions. The surge in crude oil prices, of course, is a big worry. Commodity trader Trafigura warned that crude oil may spike to $150 a barrel, threatening the economy. That has led to US President Joe Biden planning a trip to Saudi Arabia, which prompted my colleague Nitin Sharma to quote Rumi, tongue firmly in cheek: “Lovers have heartaches that can’t be cured by drugs or sleep or games, but only by seeing their beloved.” So, in the final analysis, is growth robust or not? Despite the hikes, the real repo rate is still around the same level it was a year ago, which should support growth. But the key to the conundrum is this piece by IndusInd Bank chief economist Gaurav Kapur, which points out that, in response to policy tightening, output starts contracting in three quarters. In other words, the impact of the rate cuts will be felt with a long lag, which is why, although the economy is doing fine at the moment, the RBI is projecting real GDP growth of only 4 percent in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year. What does all this mean for the equity markets? This FT story, free to read for MC Pro subscribers, says there is another leg down for the markets. Another story talks about the drying up of liquidity in global markets. We took a look at how the Sun TV, CCL Products, Equitas SFB, NMDC and Engineers India stocks are expected to perform, given the current environment.

3,RBI prioritising inflation over growth: Official,economy," The Reserve Bank of India is prioritizing inflation over growth, which is manifested by the recent hikes in repo rate, an official of the central bank said on Friday. Speaking at an interactive session organised by the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce and Industry here, he also said financial markets across asset classes and geographies witnessed unprecedented volatility during the past two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Central banks across the globe will raise interest rates in future owing to much higher than expected inflation. This is a major risk, said Radha Shyam Ratho, Executive Director, RBI. He said the RBI is giving priority to inflation over growth so that the level of price rise remains within targets without affecting growth. The apex bank had recently raised the interest rate by 50 basis points to a two-year high of 4.9 per cent. The rate hike came on the back of a 40 basis-point increase effected at an unscheduled meeting on May 4. Ratho said the bond market has become very volatile, too, which is a rare phenomenon. ""This will have an impact on the domestic economy, he added. The RBI official said despite the Russia-Ukraine conflict disrupting the global supply chain, India's external sector remains healthy, and the current account deficit (CAD) is sustainable with normal capital flows. Referring to exchange rate management, he said the central bank does not have a fixed band and it is determined by market forces. Ratho said the RBI has projected real GDP growth of 7.2 per cent with inflation forecast being revised 100 basis points upwards to 6.7 per cent."
4,"PM inaugurates In-SPACe, says he hopes Indian firms will become global leaders in space",economy," Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday inaugurated the headquarters of the Indian Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) here, set up to promote private investment and innovation in the space sector. As in Information Technology, he hopes that Indian firms will emerge as leaders in the global space sector too, he said. Earlier, the space sector was closed to private companies as ""they could only be vendors"", but his government opened it up by bringing in reforms, Modi said. Big ideas can only make big winners. We have removed all restrictions by bringing reforms in the space sector,"" he said. IN-SPACe will support private industry and begin the process of ""making winners in the space sector, the prime minister further said. I am hopeful that like in the IT sector, our industry will also take the lead in the global space sector, he said. Today on social media, if youths have to share something important, they will write `watch this space'. IN-SPACe has the potential to revolutionise the space industry. So I would say 'watch this space'. The government is also working on a new space policy which will provide ease of doing business in the sector, he said. ""India's space programme has been, in a way, the biggest identity of `Atmanirbhar Bharat'. When this programme gets the strength of the Indian private sector, you can imagine how much it will increase its strength,"" the prime minister said.In the past, the country's youth did not get the opportunity to work in the space sector and it was our misfortune that ""the difference between regulation and restriction was forgotten,"" he said. ""Indian youth carry with them innovation, energy and spirit….Their risk-taking capacity is also very high. These are vital for the development of any country….If any youth wants to innovate, can we say, this can only be done by government facilities?….But in our country, this was the situation in many sectors,"" the prime minister said. ""Our government is removing all restrictions before the Indian youth, it is carrying out reforms,"" he said, listing the opening of defence production, drone policy, geo-spatial data guidelines and work-from-anywhere facility in the telecom/IT sector as examples. The government is working on the New Indian Space Policy for increasing the coordination between government companies, space industry, start-ups and institutions, the PM said. ""We are soon going to bring a policy to improve ease of doing business in the space sector,"" he added. ""It is our endeavor to create the maximum ease of doing business environment for the private sector of India, so that the private sector of the country helps the countrymen equally in the ease of living,"" he added. When the government started reforms in the space sector, some people raised doubts as to who will respond to it, but today there are more than 60 Indian private companies in the sector, Modi said. The private sector has entered the sector by having its own launch vehicles, satellites and some firms have even prepared designs for their own rockets, he said. The data collected by private space companies is going to give them huge power in future, Modi said, adding that the global space industry is valued at USD 400 billion and has the potential to become a USD 1 trillion industry by 2040.""There are two areas which are going to be most influential in the coming days, they are space and sea,"" Modi further said, adding that the country needs to move forward without delay in these areas. The inauguration function also witnessed the singing of MoUs between IN-SPACe and private sector companies working in the field of space-based applications and services."
5,States' earnings from stamp duty and registration fees rise 34% in FY22; Maharashtra leads: Report,economy," States' revenues from stamp duty and registration fees jumped 34 per cent in FY22 to Rs 17.11 lakh crore, with Maharashtra leading all the states, a domestic brokerage said on Friday. Maharashtra witnessed a 40 per cent growth in the revenue collection from the two sources at Rs 3.55 lakh crore, and was followed by Uttar Pradesh at Rs 2 lakh crore (up 22 per cent) and Tamil Nadu at Rs 1.43 lakh crore (up 23 per cent), the report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. From a revenue growth perspective, Telangana witnessed the highest increment at 136 per cent to Rs 1.23 lakh crore as against Rs 52,433 crore in the year-ago period, the report which analysed 27 states and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir said. The revenues are collected primarily from real estate transactions in a particular state, and will get influenced both by the number of deals and also the prices at which they happen, the report said. The brokerage's chief economist Nikhil Gupta said the residential realty market witnessed a revival in the last fiscal and the average growth in the last two years of the pandemic was 15 per cent. He, however, was sceptical if the growth can be sustained amid economic uncertainties."
6,Japan edges closer to intervention in yen,economy," Japan's government and central bank said on Friday they were concerned by recent sharp falls in the yen in a rare joint statement, the strongest warning to date that Tokyo could intervene to support the currency as it plumbs 20-year lows. The statement underscores growing concern among policymakers over the damage that sharp yen depreciation could inflict on Japan's fragile economy by hurting business activity and consumers. But many market players doubt that G7 member Japan will step in soon to directly prop up the yen, a diplomatically fraught and potentially costly course of action that last occurred 20 years ago. After a meeting with his Bank of Japan (BOJ) counterpart, top currency diplomat Masato Kanda told reporters that Tokyo will ""respond flexibly with all options on the table."" He declined to say whether Tokyo could negotiate with other countries to jointly step into the market. The G7, of which Japan is a member, has a long standing policy that markets ought to determine currency rates, but that the group will closely coordinate on currency moves, and that excessive and disorderly exchange-rate moves could hurt growth. ""We have seen sharp yen declines and are concerned about recent currency market moves,"" the Ministry of Finance, BOJ and the Financial Services Agency said in the joint statement released after their executives' meeting. ""We will communicate closely with each country's currency authorities and respond appropriately as needed,"" based on the G7 principles, the statement said. Officials of the three institutions meet occasionally, usually to signal to markets their alarm over sharp market moves. But it is rare for them to issue a joint statement with explicit warnings over currency moves. The yen briefly rallied to 133.37 yen per dollar after the statement, up 0.7% on the session, before settling at 133.67. ""Tokyo could intervene if the yen slides below 135 to the dollar and starts going into a free fall. That's when Tokyo really needs to step in,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute in Tokyo. ""But Washington won't join so it will be solo intervention. For the United States, there's really no merit in joining Tokyo on intervention."" South Korean won, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen notes are seen on U.S. 100 dollar notes in this picture illustration taken in Seoul, South Korea, December 15, 2015. The yen's sharp declines have inflated already rising raw material import costs, jacking up households' living costs and putting pressure on the BOJ to address creeping inflation. The BOJ and the U.S. Federal Reserve are both scheduled to hold policy meetings next week. With the Japanese economy still much weaker than its peers, the BOJ is widely expected to maintain its ultra-easy policy next week. But it will face the dilemma of having to stick with low rates, even though it could fuel further yen declines. ""I don't think today's statement would have a direct impact on the BOJ's policy meeting next week,"" said Hiroshi Ugai, chief Japan economist at JP Morgan Securities. ""There are limits to what the BOJ can do."" Unlike other major central banks which are flagging aggressive interest rate hikes to tackle inflation, the BOJ has repeatedly committed to keeping rates low, making Japanese assets less attractive for investors. That increasing policy divergence sent the yen down 15% against the dollar since early March and within striking distance of 135.20 hit on Jan. 31, 2002. A break past that would be its lowest since October 1998. Underscoring growing public sensitivity to rising living costs, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda was forced to apologise on Tuesday for a remark a day earlier that households were becoming more accepting of price rises. read more ""What can potentially slow the pace of depreciation is a change in policy but right now it looks like there is no indication that the Bank of Japan is concerned about inflation or the impact of the weak yen on that,"" said Moh Siong Sim, a currency strategist at Bank of Singapore. ""It (the joint statement) is more of a verbal intervention and I’m not sure whether it will amount to any action and won’t have any impact on the yen,"" he said, adding the bar for actual intervention in foreign exchange markets remains very high. Given the economy's heavy reliance on exports, Japan has historically focused on arresting sharp rises in the yen and taken a hands-off approach on yen falls."
7,"Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Rain, rain, come again",economy," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. From the throat of the overflowing spout! As we wait for the monsoon rains to materialise, you might want to sample this old poem from H.W. Longfellow. The progress of the monsoons in the first week of the rainy season has been dismal. At an aggregate level, the deficit is 41 percent for the past eight days. North and central India, especially, have been hard hit. True, these are early days and the start of the rains is often erratic. Weather forecasters the Indian Meteorological Department and SkyMet have both said this year the monsoon will be normal. Another important yardstick to track for the Kharif crop is the water level in reservoirs across the country. At an aggregate level, reservoirs are now at 30 percent capacity. While the number looks alarming, note that it is 7 percent higher than last year and one-third higher than the last 10 years’ average. While the monsoon is important for the rural economy every year, there is an added edge this year due to multiple factors. We are coming off a heat wave which blighted the wheat crop. As a result, wheat procurement by the government has suffered. The Indian Express reported that the wheat stock in the government pool stood at 31 million tonnes on June 1, the lowest in 14 years. Rice stocks at around 50 million tonnes are about the same as a year ago, but the government possibly feels that it needs to encourage paddy cultivation to sustain the food security programme. Thus, the minimum support price for paddy too was raised by Rs 100 a quintal. Secondly, inflation has bitten rural India more. Rural demand is weak. If the monsoon doesn’t turn up on time and in the required quantity over the required area, inflation could worsen, which could force the Reserve Bank of India to go in for sharper rate hikes. To keep track of the rain’s quantity, spread and impact on the sowing season, we launched our seasonal Monsoon Tracker last week, exclusive for MC Pro subscribers.

8,"Russia can cooperate not only with India, China but also with others; impossible to 'fence off' country like ours: Putin",economy," Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow has the opportunity to build partnerships not only with India and China, but also with Latin America and Africa, asserting that it is impossible to ""fence off"" a country like Russia from the outside. Putin, during a meeting with young entrepreneurs here on Thursday, said that the world is big and diverse. You have just mentioned China and India. Why only China and India? It is also Latin America. Perhaps, Africa today is still sleeping, but it is waking up, 1.5 billion people live there. What about Southeast Asia, he was quoted as saying by Russia's state-run Tass news agency. Russia has the opportunity to build partnerships not only with China and India, but also with Latin America, as well as Africa, which is still sleeping, but is about waking up, Putin said. Bilateral ties with Russia are a key pillar of India's foreign policy. India sees Russia as a longstanding and time-tested friend that has played a significant role in its economic development and security. Apparently referring to the economic sanctions imposed by the West on Moscow following its military operation in Ukraine, Putin said ""it is impossible to fence off a country like Russia from the outside."" The present-day Russia's mission is to get back and strengthen its sovereignty and territories, he said. It looks like our mission, too, is to get back and strengthen, and if we proceed from the fact that these core values are the basis of our existence, we will definitely succeed in achieving the goals ahead of us, Putin said. Amidst European Union's calls to look for the alternatives of Russia's energy supply, Putin said that the abandonment of Russian energy resources is unlikely in the coming years. Rejection of Russian energy resources in recent years appears to be unlikely, he said. As regards abandonment of our energy resources, the probability is low in several years to come and nobody knows what will occur during several years. Nobody will set concrete plugs in wells, there is no such need, Putin said. The Russian President visited a multimedia exhibition at the All-Russian Exhibition Center, dedicated to the 350th anniversary of the birth of Peter I, the first Russian Emperor. He praised Peter the Great's role in building the Russian state. Drawing an analogy to the time of Peter the Great, Putin said that Peter I did not seize any Swedish territories during the Great Northern War but got them back. When Peter the Great had founded Russia's new capital, none of the European countries recognised Russia's right to that region, he said. Everyone viewed it as part of Sweden but Slavic people lived there from time immemorial along with the Finno-Ugric peoples, and the region was controlled by the Russian state. The same went for the western direction, Putin said. Putin said that Peter I was a prominent statesman and military leader, a patriot who had fully committed himself to serving his country. According to him, Peter I's ambitious reforms in state management, the economy, science, culture and education helped strengthen Russia's authority on the international stage and largely determined the country's development as a strong and sovereign power for centuries to come. In October 2018, Putin signed a decree about celebrating the 350th anniversary of the birth of Peter I this year. Peter I was Russia's last tsar (1682-1721) and first emperor (1721-1725) under whose rule a regular Army and Navy were created in Russia, the city of St. Petersburg was founded, the country was proclaimed an empire and underwent major reforms. Putin on February 24 announced a 'special military operation' in Ukraine, leading to a series of sanctions by the West along with condemnation by the UN, the EU and others. Many multinational companies suspended their business in Russia as a fallout of the Russian invasion of Ukraine."

10,Gold slips as dollar firms ahead of U.S. inflation data,economy," Gold prices dipped on Friday as the dollar firmed ahead of key U.S. inflation data that could drive the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy decisions. Spot gold fell 0.4% to $1,840.44 per ounce, as of 1131 GMT, and was down about 0.5% for the week. U.S. gold futures declined 0.6% to $1,842.30. ""The U.S. dollar is trading marginally higher, thus weighing on gold prices, but price action will likely remain muted as we head into U.S. CPI later today,"" said DailyFX analyst Warren Venketas. A stronger dollar makes bullion expensive for overseas buyers. ""Gold has been consolidating around the key $1,850 zone for some time now, but U.S. inflation data could prompt a breakout,"" Venketas added. A higher-than-expected inflation print could bolster the Fed's aggressive stance as the U.S. central bank is expected to increase rates by 50 basis points next week and in July. The consensus forecast sees the year-over-year inflation rate for May steady at a blistering 8.3%. Major central banks are picking up the pace of interest rate hikes to get on top of surging inflation. A high interest rate environment tends to increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. ""Hawkish central banks, rising real rates and a stronger U.S. dollar have taken the shine off the gold market. Withdrawal of unprecedented fiscal and monetary support is also weighing on sentiment,"" ANZ Research said in a note. The current price range of $1,800$1,900 per ounce will not provide any clear direction until gold breaks either side of the range, ANZ noted. Meanwhile, gold discounts in India this week were stretched to their highest in seven weeks, while fresh concerns over the spread of COVID-19 in top consumer China left buyers reluctant to make purchases. [GOL/AS] Elsewhere, silver slipped 0.7% to $21.50 and platinum was down 0.1% at $969.81, while palladium fell 0.2% to $1,921.73. All of them were on course for weekly declines, with platinum set for its worst week since April 22."
11,India's industrial growth hits 8-month high of 7.1% in April on favourable base,economy," India's industrial growth, as per the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), quickened to 7.1 percent in April from 2.2 percent in March, data released on June 10 by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation showed. At 7.1 percent, the April industrial growth rate is the highest in eight months, althouth it has been aided by a favourable base effect. The sharp up-tick in IIP growth comes after data released last month showed India's eight core sectors grew 8.4 percent in April, up from 4.9 percent in March. With the eight core industries accounting for 40.3 percent of the total weight of IIP, IIP growth tracks the performance of these core sectors. IIP growth in April 2021 was 133.5 percent. The year-ago growth rates across all categories are extremely high due to a statistical effect as the base period for the April 2021 growth rates was April 2020, which saw the entire country in lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus. This brought economic activity to a halt. As such, any output comparisons with April 2020 are bound to produce unusally large growth rates. The low base meant April saw all three sectors - mining, manufacturing, and electricity - showing a huge improvement in output growth. The same was true for all types of goods under the use-based classification, except infrastructure goods. Production of infrastructure goods rose 3.8 percent in April, down from a growth of 6.7 percent in March. ""The strength witnessed in early high frequency indicators such as manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, Goods and Services Tax collection, et cetera is not yet translating into industrial production,"" noted Vivek Rathi, director-research at Knight Frank India. ""Sequential decline in capital goods, which is a proxy for investments is worrisome. Also, persisting contraction in consumer durables adds to concerns of weakening consumption growth amidst rising prices, which needs policy attention,"" Rathi added."
12,Is Delhi’s coal ban more hot air?,economy," At the Stockholm+50 conference, Dr Arvind Kumar, a New Delhi-based chest surgeon, displayed lung x-rays of children to demonstrate how breathing Delhi air made everyone a smoker, even the new-born. No wonder then, even as the residents of Delhi, one of the most-polluted cities in the world, welcome the recent directive from Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to ban the use of coal in industrial, domestic and other miscellaneous applications in the entire Delhi-NCR region from January 1, 2023, questions are being raised about the efficacy of the order, and the exemption granted to thermal power plants that use ‘low-sulphur coal’. The CAQM was established in August 2021, and is currently India’s highest authority on air pollution. According to current estimates, 1.7 million tonnes of coal is used annually by industries in the NCR, and the fuel contributes significantly to the region’s air pollution levels. The NCR comprises cities from the states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh, in addition to the capital city of New Delhi. The June 3 CAQM order says that the ban on the use of coal will come in force with effect from October 1 in areas having piped natural gas (PNG) infrastructure and supply. Industries that are likely to face issues related to availability of PNG have been given an exemption till December 31, and the coal ban for them will be applicable from January 1, 2023. The commission also specified the permissible levels of emissions for particulate matter (PM), SO2, NOx, and CO2. Effectively, as per the directive, all the industries using coal have six months to switch to PNG or biomass fuel, otherwise they will face closure. However, in absence of a clear action plan to help these industries transition, there is widespread scepticism on the efficacy of this latest order in abating air pollution. Exemption has also been granted to certain industries involved in metal melting, smelting, heating, and refining processes that require specific temperature and calorific value, and also industries with standalone cupola-based foundries, which mandatorily require a carbon feed stock, for “industrial application only in regions beyond the jurisdiction of GNCTD”. According to Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), in 2020, Delhi alone sourced 33.6 percent of its power needs from coal based thermal power plants with the rest from gas-fired plants. The coal power plants around Delhi account for over 60 percent of the total particulate matter emissions from all industries as well as 45 percent of SO2, 30 percent of NOx, and over 80 percent of mercury. In 2015, the Union environment ministry issued a notification with amended rules allowing thermal power plants within 10 kilometres of the NCR and in cities with more than 1 million population to comply with new emission norms by installing Flue Gas Desulpherisation (FGD) and Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP) systems by the end of 2022. But only six units at two thermal power plants have so far installed FGD. With two deadlines already elapsed, the first was December 2017 and the second was December 2019, the power plants are yet to comply with the prescribed emission standards citing prohibitive costs. An easier way of reducing sulphur is washing coal, a directive from the MoEFCC to that effect was put out in the mid-1990’s, but none of the power plants follow that order either. Given the brazen non-compliance, i t is not surprising that there is such widespread scepticism around the latest announcement. Speaking to this author, Dr Kumar said: “The devil is in the details, and a lack of a detailed plan on how this ban will be implemented takes away some of the excitement around this announcement. Such a ban will have implications on the livelihoods and economy, and without a detailed roadmap of implementation, it is too early to celebrate this decision.” Incidentally according to a study by CEEW in 2021, the 11 coal-fired power plants in the NCR contributed 7 percent to Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on an average between October 2020 and January 2021, while vehicles contributed 14 percent. ‘Too little, too late’ is generally the case when it comes to environmental protection in India. The latest directive from the CAQM is a step in the right direction, but for it to be effective it cannot have double standards and give a free pass to thermal power plants. The fact is that almost all the coal-fired power plants are anyway running at sub-optimal capacity of about 20-30 percent, and yet are the major contributors to Delhi’s air pollution."
13,Happy ending for India as WTO conference wraps up with global deals? Find out,economy," The World Trade Organization's 164 members approved a series of trade agreements on Friday that included commitments on fish and pledges on health and food security after more than five gruelling days of negotiations. At one stage, a series of demands from India, which sees itself as the champion of poor farmers and fishermen as well as developing countries, appeared set to paralyse talks but accommodations were found. At WTO, India was fighting a long list of battles against the developed economies from the right to stockpile and export foodgrains, tax on digital transactions, and fishing without restrictions. The agreements package by the WTO included the two highest profile deals under consideration - on fisheries and on a partial waiver of intellectual property (IP) rights for COVID-19 vaccines. While India had pushed for more comprehensive measures in these areas, as well as for talks on agriculture, the final outcome has been backed by New Delhi as promising. Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal today said that India has achieved spectacular success at WTO's 12th ministerial conference (MC12) in Geneva, Switzerland. ""India is 100% satisfied with the outcome of WTO's MC12 conference. India was successful in ensuring the livelihood of its farmers and fishermen,"" Goyal said. He added that the nation was successful in convincing all countries to ensure a patent waiver for the manufacturing of Covid vaccines. Here's a look at India's wins and misses at the WTO along with some backdrop. The long road to partial waiver of IP rights for COVID-19 vaccines Back in October 2020, India and South Africa had proposed talks on a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights for vaccine manufacturers. While India had the unofficial backing of more than 120 countries, major global powers continued to stall talks, citing grave discomfort at a “potential blanket suspension of the terms of the TRIPS agreement”. Ongoing talks at the WTO over the issue had stalled yet again earlier this year, despite a recent push by India to begin virtual interactions among member- states. Public stockholdings Goyal today said that there is no negative outcome for India's agriculture sector. India's public stockholding programme for foodgrain will also continue unhindered, he added. On the issue of food security, he said talks have progressed to a certain degree. A proposed global declaration to not curb foodgrain exports to the World Food Programme (WFP), which seeks to fight hunger in places hit by conflicts, disasters, and climate change, passed in a modified form after being blocked by India. India and other developing nations run major public stockholding programmes to purchase, stockpile and distribute foodgrains to people in need. Richer economies say some stockholding programmes are considered to distort trade when they involve purchases from farmers at prices fixed by the governments, such as India’s minimum support price programme. E-commerce taxation The WTO has also decided to extend yet again the moratorium on taxation on e-commerce transactions. The WTO members had agreed not to impose customs duties on electronic transmissions since 1998 and the moratorium has been periodically extended at successive ministerial conferences. However, India has increasingly become a strict opponent of the move and initially blocked the continuation of the moratorium at MC12. New Delhi had stressed that it is willing to tax electronic transactions in the near future. It also wants to retain the policy space to grant preferential treatment of digital products created within India. ""The moratorium was extended but with a deadline. It was decided that there has to be clarity on this issue by March 2024,"" Goyal said today. The next ministerial conference is set to be held then. While the profits and revenues of digital players are rising steadily, the ability of governments to check these imports and generate additional tariff revenues is being ‘severely’ limited because of the moratorium, India has said. The potential tariff revenue loss to developing countries is estimated at $10 billion annually. Fishing subsidies ""India was successful in ensuring the livelihood of its farmers and fishermen,"" Goyal said today. The WTO conference saw an accord to curb fishing subsidies. The fishing subsidies deal has the potential to reverse collapsing fish stocks. Though pared back significantly, it still drew approval. ""The agreement on fisheries is currently limited to illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing. The discussion on extending this to all government subsidies will take place going forward. Currently, there are no restrictions on government subsidies,"" Goyal said. Instead, the WTO has cognisance of India's demand that nations that have consistently supported illegal deepsea fishing be regulated, he added. The WTO fish deal has enormous impact on fishermen and marine exports given the fact that fish constitute food for poorer nations. According to the latest data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), fish stocks are at risk of collapsing in many parts of the world due to overexploitation. It is estimated that 34 percent of the global stocks are overfished, compared to 10 percent in 1974. In other words, they are being exploited at a pace where the fish population cannot replenish itself. Declining fish stocks threaten to worsen poverty and endanger coastal communities that rely on fishing. Roughly 39 million people depend on captured fisheries for their livelihood, according to the WTO. Healthy seas are also important for food security, with fish providing 20 percent of animal protein needs, on an average for 3.3 billion people. The WTO admits that, in theory, fishing should be checked by its very environment: low-fish stocks should mean more time consumed in the process of fishing and increased costs. The problem, however, is that very often state funding keeps an unprofitable fishing fleet at sea. Global fisheries subsidies are estimated to range from $14 billion to $54 billion per year."
14,Retail inflation may ease out to 7.1% but stay above RBI comfort zone,economy," India's headline retail inflation rate is seen falling to 7.1 percent in May, with a favourable base effect likely to more than cancel out the impact of a sizeable increase in prices of key items. According to a Moneycontrol poll of 10 economists, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation likely fell sharply last month from a 95-month high of 7.79 percent in April. The statistics ministry will release CPI inflation data for May at 5.30 PM on June 13. At 7.1 percent, it will be the fifth consecutive month in which inflation would have been above the 6 percent upper bound of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) tolerance band and the 32nd straight month in which it would be higher than the medium-term target of 4 percent. With the Monetary Policy Committee increasingly likely to fail on the inflation mandate front, even a large fall in inflation in May to 7.1 percent is unlikely to have any impact on the future course of monetary policy. While raising the policy repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.9 percent on June 8, the RBI raised its inflation forecast for FY23 to 6.7 percent, with an average of 7.5 percent for April-June. Economists widely expect the repo rate to be increased at least twice more in FY23. In May, out of the 22 food items on which the Department of Consumer Affairs compiles data, only three saw a month-on-month fall in prices. Edible oils were the biggest concern, with five of the six categories on which data is available posting a price rise of 1.7-4.2 percent compared to April. Only the price of mustard oil rose marginally, up a mere 0.1 percent from the previous month. Among vegetables, while the price of onions fell 9.1 percent in May, those of tomatoes were up a huge 61.5 percent. Potato prices were up 8.9 percent, data from the consumer affairs department showed. Some of the other food items to display a month-on-month increase in price in May include salt (1.7 percent), wheat (1.5 percent) and sugar (0.8 percent). According to Rahul Bajoria, chief India economist at Barclays, food and beverage inflation is likely to come down from April's 8.1 percent, but stay elevated at 7.6 percent in May. However, an extremely favourable base effect will more than cancel out the sequential increase in prices. Base favours Retail inflation for any given month is arrived at by calculating the percentage change in the CPI for the month over the same month in the previous year. As such, if the index rose by a large amount in the same month last year, it could lead to lower inflation in the latest month. In May 2021, the CPI was 160.4—1.6 percent higher than the 157.8 seen in April 2021. In April 2022, the CPI was 170.1. So, if the month-on-month increase in the CPI in May is less than 1.6 percent, CPI inflation will fall from its April figure of 7.79 percent. In fact, CPI inflation could fall to as low as 6 percent in May if the index was unchanged at 170.1, although this is extremely unlikely. Apart from a favourable base effect, lower fuel prices also helped pull down inflation in May. The average price of petrol and diesel was around 2 percent lower in May compared to April on account of the cut in the excise duty announced by the Centre on May 21, according to data from the government's Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell. However, the full impact of the fuel tax cut is expected to be reflected in the June inflation number. Core inflation, seen as an indicator of underlying demand, is expected to moderate sharply from April's 7 percent. However, this too would be due to a favourable base effect, with prices likely to show strong sequential momentum. ""The impact of the increases in the prices of generic drugs approved earlier in April should also be visible in May healthcare costs. Surging costs for a variety of intermediate goods are now beginning to be passed on to retail customers,"" Barclays' Bajoria said."
15,Three imports that can drive inflation higher in the next few quarters,economy," The monetary policy committee of the Reserve Bank of India revised its projections of consumer price inflation for the current financial year to 6.7 percent, a full percentage point higher than its April estimates, as inflation became more widespread and posed a risk of climbing higher. This was the second revision in its projection for the current year after it had estimated the inflation at 4.5 percent in the post-budget February policy. Elevated commodity prices, revisions in electricity tariffs, continuing trade and supply chain bottlenecks and rising pass-through of input costs to retail prices of manufactured goods and services were seen to pose upside risks to inflation. The committee has assumed that the Indian basket of petroleum crude will average $105 a barrel during the year and monsoons will be normal. Here’s a close look at three key risks to inflation from imports. Soaring petro prices The Indian basket has averaged more than $105 so far this financial year. It was nearly $110 in May, rising from $103 in April. It was about $118 a barrel for the first ten days of June, as Brent crude climbed to $120. The Indian basket is a blend of Oman and Dubai average and Brent dated, with the latter contributing about 25 percent. The Omani and Dubai crude were trading at $111-119 a barrel during June. Goldman Sachs has projected that Brent will rise to $140 a barrel in July-September and stay elevated as rising demand outstrips supply. It expects crude to average $135 a barrel between July 2022 and June 2023. Prices climbed this week even after the OPEC and its partners committed to boosting supplies in July and August. Analysts are not the only ones to project higher prices for crude. The Energy Minister of the UAE Suhail Al-Mazrouei recently warned of further increases in oil prices when demand from China returns. He also said that OPEC and its partners might not be able to match supply with the rising demand and that the lag was already 2.6 million barrels a day. If international crude oil prices climb as projected, the Indian basket is also bound to climb close to those levels, requiring the RBI to revise its estimates. Every $10 increase in crude oil price increases CPI inflation by about 50 basis points. Consumers may get relief only if there is more reduction in taxes on petrol and diesel. The RBI has suggested a reduction in states’ value-added tax on the two fuels to soften inflationary pressures. Power from imported coal Faced with the prospect of electricity blackout due to a shortfall in supplies of coal from Coal India and other domestic sources, the Union government directed power generating companies to blend imported and domestically procured coal. A deadline of June 15 was set for beginning the blending process. Imported coal is way more expensive than domestically sourced coal and so its increased usage can force power prices upwards. The All India Power Engineers Federation has said that the rise in the use of imported coal would increase electricity tariff by Rs 0.70-1 per unit for the current financial year. News reports suggest that NTPC, which is importing about 6.25 million tonnes of coal, may raise tariffs by 50-70 paise. The state-owned and private generating companies can raise tariffs only with regulatory approval. However, they have been allowed to charge a compensation tariff. These may be passed on as quarterly fuel surcharges. Edible oil supply shortfall India is the largest importer of edible oils in the world – about 55-60 percent of the country’s demand is met from imports. Palm oil, soyabean oil and sunflower oil are the key edible oils imported by India. The output and availability of edible oils are subject to the vagaries of nature, availability of labour and national policies. The war in Ukraine had sent the already elevated oil prices higher forcing countries such as Indonesia, the largest producer of palm oil, to adopt protectionist measures. The availability of sunflower oil plunged with the onset of the war, as Ukraine and Russia are the chief producers and exporters. The output of soyabean in Brazil in the recently concluded harvest was about 10 percent lower than last year and yields were about 11 percent below trend, as southern Brazil faced a drought due to the second consecutive year of the La Nina phenomenon. Brazil is the largest producer of soyabean, with Argentina and the US the other leading producers. Overall, the global output of soyabean was estimated to have increased from the last year’s levels and that had a cooling effect on prices. However, there are indications that the La Nina might appear again this year, although three consecutive appearances are rare. That might affect the crop in the next season and put pressure on prices to climb higher. Soyabean oil prices had climbed to about $0.91 a pound by the end of April and have cooled to about $0.82, which is still above the pre-war price of about $0.69. Palm oil prices have also cooled from the 52-week high of about $8,760 a tonne to about $6,600, which is quite close to the pre-war prices. They were about $4,000 a tonne a year ago and around $5,000 at the beginning of the calendar year. Loosening of export restrictions by Indonesia might allow the prices to drift lower from the current level. However, a shortage of labour could affect palm oil output in Malaysia, the second-largest producer. Foreign workers, mostly from Indonesia, make up about 80 percent of the workforce in Malaysia palm plantations, but Jakarta cancelled plans to send migrant workers to its neighbouring nation earlier this month. While measures are being taken to bring workers from other countries, there could be a short-term disruption in supplies."
16,"Indian crude oil basket hits 10-year high; petrol, diesel prices unchanged",economy," The basket of crude oil that India buys has hit a decade high of USD 121 per barrel, but retail selling prices of petrol and diesel continue to remain frozen. The Indian basket on June 9 touched USD 121.28, matching levels seen in February/March 2012, according to data available from the oil ministry's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). As per the PPAC, the Indian basket of crude oil averaged USD 111.86 per barrel between February 25 and March 29 - the immediate period after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil on fire. It averaged USD 103.44 a barrel between March 30 and April 27. International oil prices held near a 13-week high on Thursday, underpinned by robust demand from key buyers like the US. They, however, pared some gains on Friday, with Brent crude futures for August losing 81 cents to trade at USD 122.26 per barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude for July was at USD 120.72 a barrel, down 79 cents. Retail fuel rates, however, continue to be on a freeze in India. State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) are supposed to adjust petrol and diesel prices daily in line with the cost, but they have been since November 2021 moderating pump rates. Petrol & Diesel Rates Yesterday Wednesday, 22nd June, 2022 Petrol Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Wednesday, 22nd June, 2022 Diesel Rate in Mumbai Yesterday India is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and so local pump rates are benchmarked against international prices. Industry sources said local pump rates are benchmarked to around USD 85 per barrel crude oil price but oil firms haven't changed rates as they aid the government in trying to control inflation, which already is ruling at an almost eight-year high of 7.8 per cent. Fuel prices, particularly diesel, have a cascading effect on inflation as an elevated price will lead to higher transportation costs, spiking prices across the board, including essentials like vegetables. The sources said the industry was selling petrol at a loss of about Rs 18 per litre and diesel at Rs 21 a litre. Petrol and diesel prices were last revised to align with the cost on April 6 and have been on freeze since then. Last month, rates were reduced after the government cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 8 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 6. Last week, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri stated that oil companies are responsible corporate citizens and that the government wasn't dictating retail selling prices. Despite a surge in oil prices, the three state fuel retailers first froze petrol and diesel rates for a record 137 days beginning in early November 2021 when five states, including Uttar Pradesh, went to the polls and then went into a hiatus again in April that is now 65 days old. While state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) have maintained retail operations despite losses, private sector retailers like Reliance-BP and Nayara Energy have curtailed operations to cut losses. In some places, Nayara is selling fuel at rates that are Rs 3 a litre higher than public sector competition."
17,OMCs up ethanol procurement price as part of 6-months relief package,economy," State-run oil marketing companies have announced an increase in ethanol procurement price for a six months period ending November 30 to provide relief to ethanol manufacturers who are facing high input cost, primarily on account of fuel and electricity. Oil marketing companies– Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL)-- procure ethanol to blend with fuel before selling it. India achieved its target of an average of 10% blending across the country five months in advance earlier this month and now the government and industry are hopeful of expediting the more ambitious target of increasing the ethanol blending to 20% by 2025-26. Three senior officials from the oil marketing companies confirmed that the companies have announced a ‘Six-months Relief Scheme’ to support ethanol manufacturers. There is no change in the basic price of ethanol from the different feedstock and the vendors have to maintain the prevailing rates in the invoices. To avail the relief, the vendors will have to raise a separate invoice for the relief amount at the end of every quarter. “Due to the exorbitant increase in the coal prices, the pricing committee of the OMCs approved the relief scheme to ethanol producers. The same has been conveyed to our locations, the Sugar Mills association and the All India Distilleries association,” an official from one of the OMCs said. Petrol & Diesel Rates Yesterday Wednesday, 22nd June, 2022 Petrol Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Wednesday, 22nd June, 2022 Diesel Rate in Mumbai Yesterday Another official said that the relief was previously being given to vendors in states with deficits to support the ethanol industry. Moneycontrol has seen the notification, which states that the relief package is applicable for all supplies of ethanol invoiced to OMCs between June 1, 2022, and November 30, 2022. The OMCs will pay the relief amount to vendors after completion of each quarter, and the applicable GST of 5% will be applicable on the relief amount. The relief amount will be based on the feedstock such as a relief of Rs 1606/kl from sugarcane juice/sugar/sugar syrup based ethanol, Rs 1493/kL for B-heavy molasses based ethanol, Rs 1179/kL for C-heavy molasses based ethanol, Rs 2337/kL for damaged food grain based ethanol, and Rs 1437 on surplus rice based ethanol. “With this relief scheme, we expect all vendors to maximize ethanol supplies and partner with us in achieving the ethanol blending targets,” the OMCs said in their notification. Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri said on June 6 that some petrol pumps in the country may be able to sell 20% ethanol blended petrol ahead of the April 2023 target. India’s ethanol blending percentage stood at 2.33% in 2014. With the steps taken by the government in the last eight years, the availability of ethanol for blending is expected to go up to 450 crore litres in the current Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) from 67 crore litres in 2014."
18,Indian oil firms to compensate ethanol makers for higher energy costs,economy," Indian state fuel retailers have agreed to provide monetary relief to sugar mills and other producers of ethanol to compensate for high energy costs to boost biofuel production, according to a letter written by the companies to manufacturers. India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, has expedited efforts to double ethanol blending with gasoline to 20% from the current 10% across the country from 2025/26. The Indian government fixes the ethanol purchase prices for fuel retailers - Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp -- every marketing year. However, the fuel retailers have announced they will pay extra to ethanol manufacturers to compensate for high energy and power costs, a BPCL spokesman said. The three state fuel retailers have announced the 'relief scheme' for June 1 to Nov. 30. The companies will pay an additional 1,604 rupees ($20.62) per kilolitre for ethanol produced from sugar cane juice, and 1,493 rupees for B- heavy molasses and 1,179 rupees for ethanol produced from C-heavy molasses, the letter showed. The B-heavy molasses juice has some sucrose content left in them for sugar production, whereas C-heavy molasses is a cane by-product that has no sugar content left in it. For a kilolitre of ethanol produced from damaged foodgrains and rice, the relief is fixed at 2,337 rupees and 1,437 rupees, the letter showed."
19,"Despite ban, India’s wheat export seen at 7 million tonnes, above 5-year average",economy," Exception to India's wheat export ban - for previous contractual commitments, government-to-government sales, and food security purposes - are expected to support an export forecast of 7 million tonnes in 2022/23, remaining well above India's export average over the past five years, the United Nations' food agency has said. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said in its Food Outlook released on Thursday that global wheat markets are embarking on the 2022/23 season with a ""great deal of uncertainty. The impacts of the ongoing war in Ukraine, trade policy changes in several countries, and high international prices will shape much of the wheat market outlook, it said adding that international wheat prices are at levels not reached since 2008, following a season of tight global availability due to reduced harvests in some major exporting countries and export suspensions by others, including Ukraine (a major exporter) and India (an emerging exporter), along with supply concerns for 2022/23 also adding pressure. Global wheat production in 2022 is predicted to decline from the 2021 record level by 0.8 per cent, reaching 771 million tonnes and marking the first drop in four years. Year-on-year falls in production in Australia, India, Morocco and Ukraine will likely outweigh expected increases in Canada, Iran and Russia. The report said that driving much of the predicted contraction in world trade in 2022/23, exports by Ukraine, a major wheat exporter, are forecast to fall by nearly 50 per cent (down 9 million tonnes) from the previous season based on the assumption of continued war-related export disruptions. In India, a ban on wheat exports announced last month, is also seen limiting shipments in 2022/23 after the country greatly increased its market share in 2021/22, amid lower exports from Ukraine, high domestic supplies following a record production in 2021, and competitive prices that helped to open trade with new markets, including Egypt and Vietnam. However, exceptions to the export ban for previous contractual commitments, government-to-government sales, and food security purposes are expected to support an export forecast of 7 million tonnes in 2022/23, remaining well above India's export average over the past five-years. Further, it said that in Asia, wheat production in India is forecast at 105.5 million tonnes, down nearly 4 per cent from the record crop gathered in 2021. Despite an above-average planted area, motivated by an increase in the government's procurement price and favourable weather early in the season, this year's foreseen decline is precipitated by unseasonably high temperatures in March and April that resulted in lower-than-expected yields and localised crop losses, it said. Last month, India announced that it is banning wheat exports in a bid to check high prices amid concerns of wheat output being hit by a scorching heat wave. Wheat exports were allowed on the basis of permission granted by the Government of India to other countries to meet their food security needs and based on the request of their governments. Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan told the Ministerial Meeting on Global Food Security Call to Action' chaired by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken under the US Presidency of the UN Security Council for the month of May that India is committed to ensuring that such adverse impact on food security is effectively mitigated and the vulnerable cushioned against sudden changes in the global market. In order to manage our own overall food security and support the needs of neighbouring and other vulnerable developing countries, we have announced some measures regarding wheat exports on 13 May 2022, he had said. Let me make it clear that these measures allow for export on the basis of approvals to those countries who are required to meet their food security demands. This will be done on the request from the concerned governments. Such a policy will ensure that we will truly respond to those who are most in need, he had said, emphasising that India will play its due role in advancing global food security. And it will do so in a manner in which it will uphold equity, display compassion and promote social justice."" Further FAO said that international trade in rice is anticipated to expand for the third successive year in 2022, with volumes exchanged across the world forecast at 53.1 million tonnes, 3 per cent higher than the 2021 peak. India is predicted to remain the world's largest rice exporter. In Asia, total sugar production is forecast to increase for the second consecutive season in 2021/22. Most of the increase stems from a bumper crop foreseen in India, while output is set to recover in Thailand. India is set to remain the world's second largest sugar exporter for the second consecutive season, with sales likely reaching 9 million tonnes in 2021/22. In India, the world's second largest sugar producer, production is forecast to reach a record high of 35 million tonnes, 13 per cent above its level in 2020/21. Most of the increase stems from a bumper crop foreseen in India, while output is set to recover in Thailand."
20,Why India holds the key to global rice market outlook,economy," India's surprise decision to ban wheat exports has raised concerns about potential curbs on rice exports as well, prompting rice traders to step up purchases and place atypical orders for longer-dated deliveries. Government and trade officials have said India, the world's biggest exporter of rice, does not plan to curb shipments for now, as local prices remain low and state warehouses hold ample supplies. That's a relief for import-dependent countries already grappling with surging food costs, but most of India's rice growing season lies ahead and any change in prospects for the harvest could alter its stance on exports of the staple grain. Monsoon rains determine the size of India's rice crop, and plentiful rains this year would help it maintain its preeminent position in the global rice trade. Patchy monsoon rains, however, would stunt the crop and cut yields and that might lead to a drawdown in state inventories that would trigger export curbs to ensure sufficient supplies for the country's 1.4 billion people. WHY IS INDIA SO CRUCIAL FOR GLOBAL RICE SUPPLIES? India's rice exports touched a record 21.5 million tonnes in 2021, more than the combined shipments of the world's next four biggest exporters of the grain: Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and the United States. India, the world's biggest rice consumer after China, has a market share of more than 40% of the global rice trade. High domestic stocks and low local prices allowed India to offer rice at deep discounts over the past two years, helping poorer nations, many in Asia and Africa, grapple with soaring wheat prices. India exports rice to more than 150 countries, and any reduction in its shipments would fuel food inflation. The grain is a staple for more than 3 billion people, and when India banned exports in 2007, global prices shot to new peaks. WHO WILL SUFFER THE MOST IF INDIA RESTRICTS RICE EXPORTS? Any move to restrict exports from India would hit almost every rice importing country. It would also allow rival suppliers Thailand and Vietnam to raise prices that are already more than 30% above Indian shipments. Other than serving Asian buyers like China, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Philippines, India supplies rice to countries such as Togo, Benin, Senegal and Cameroon. WHAT'S THE ROLE OF INDIA'S MONSOON? India's summer-sown rice accounts for more than 85% of the country's annual production, which jumped to a record 129.66 million tonnes in the crop year to June 2022. Millions of farmers start planting summer rice in June, when the monsoon lashes India. The monsoon, which delivers about 70% of India's annual rainfall, is crucial for water-thirsty rice. Indian farmers rely on monsoon rains to water half of the country's farmland that lacks irrigation. In 2022, India is forecast to receive an average amount of rainfall. But since June 1, when the four-month monsoon season began, rains are 41% below average. The rains are expected pick up by mid-June and spur the sowing of rice. Three years of average or above-average rains, and new, modern farming practices have ramped-up rice output. SHOULD THE GOVERNMENT WORRY ABOUT RICE SUPPLIES? India at present has more than sufficient stocks of rice, and local prices are lower than the state-set prices at which the government buys paddy rice from farmers. Rice export prices are also trading near the lowest in more than five years. Meanwhile, milled and paddy rice stocks at government granaries of 57.82 million tonnes are more than quadruple a target of 13.54 million tonnes."

23,"Fitch revises outlook on India to stable from negative, affirms BBB- rating",economy," Fitch Ratings has revised up its outlook on India to stable from negative while affirming the BBB- rating. ""The Outlook revision reflects our view that downside risks to medium-term growth have diminished due to India's rapid economic recovery and easing financial sector weaknesses, despite near-term headwinds from the global commodity price shock,"" Fitch said in a statement on June 10. ""We expect robust growth relative to peers to support credit metrics in line with the current rating,"" the rating agency added. Fitch expects India's GDP to grow by 7.8 percent in FY23 compared with its median forecast of 3.4 percent for countries it rateds BBB. The ratings agency had lowered the outlook to negative in June 2020 after the imposition of the draconian nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus. However, the stringent restrictions on movement and economic activity dragged the economy into a technical recession - or two consecutive quarters of year-on-year decline in GDP. However, growth has since rebounded, albeit due to a favourable base effect. As per the statistics ministry's first provisional estimate, India's GDP liekly grew 8.7 percent in FY22, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecasting growth will decline to 7.2 percent in FY23. As such, Fitch's forecast is 60 basis points higher than the central bank's. However, the agency said its latest growth forecast is 70 basis points lower than what it had forecast in March, with the impact of high global inflation ""dampening some of the positive growth momentum"". In the medium-term, Fitch said India's growth outlook was ""strong"" relative to its peers. It expects growth of around 7 percent between FY24 and FY27. ""Nevertheless, there are challenges to this forecast, given the uneven nature of the economic recovery and implementation risks for infrastructure spending and reforms,"" Fitch said. High debt The rebound from a 6.6 percent contraction of the economy in FY21 has been key in supporting India's elevated public debt levels, which have been a key rating weakness. Fitch reiterated this on June 10, saying the country's public finances ""remain a credit weakness"". ""We forecast the debt-to-GDP ratio to drop to 83.0 percent in FY23 from a peak of 87.6 percent in FY21, but it remains high compared to the 56 percent peer median. Beyond FY23, however, our expectations of only a modest narrowing of the fiscal deficit and rising sovereign borrowing costs will push the debt ratio up slightly to around 84.0 percent by FY27, even under an assumption of nominal GDP growth of around 10.5 percent,"" Fitch said. On the fiscal deficit front, Fitch expects the Centre to miss its FY23 target by 40 basis points and hit 6.8 percent of GDP due to the fuel excise duty cuts and increased subsidies announced in May to contain rising prices. In the medium term, Fitch expressed doubt over the Centre's ability to lower the fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent given that ""little clarity"" was given in the 2022 budget on how it would be achieved. ""In our view, achieving this target could prove challenging, particularly as revenue/GDP has already returned to pre-pandemic levels,"" Fitch said. With regards to monetary policy, Fitch sees the RBI raising the repo rate to 6.15 percent by FY24 to fight inflation, which it sees averaging 6.9 percent in FY23 - 20 basis points higher than what the central bank has forecast. On Fitch's revised rating for India, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal today said that the rating is an ''acknowledgement of Modi government's reforms agenda that has placed the economy on a strong footing, cushioning it from external variables and laying the roadmap for steady growth''.

24,India's retail inflation likely slipped only modestly in May: Poll,economy," India's retail inflation likely slipped modestly in May, but stayed well above the Reserve Bank of India's upper tolerance limit for a fifth consecutive month, as lower fuel prices offset surging food costs, a Reuters poll found. But the dip is expected to be temporary and analysts say the RBI remains on track to keep raising interest rates. Late last month, the government announced a series of changes to the tax structure levied on essential commodities and trimmed fuel tax to cushion consumers from rising prices and fight high inflation. Although the full effect is not expected to appear in consumer prices until June, economists say these measures have briefly helped stem the upward trend in prices. But a sharp spike in prices of wheat, tomatoes, potatoes and other vegetables - key ingredients in every Indian kitchen - will keep inflation elevated. Crop yields are down because of dry spells and heatwaves in northern India. The June 6-9 Reuters poll of 45 economists showed inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) likely slipped to 7.10% in May on a year ago, from 7.79% in April. Forecasts for the data, due at 1200 GMT on June 14, were in a 6.70%-8.30% range. ANZ economist Dhiraj Nim said the government's fuel tax cuts lowered prices by around 10% compared with earlier this year. ""However, food inflation persists to be on a sharply elevated trajectory, especially during the summer months starting from May,"" he said. Increasing food prices have become a major concern for households already hit hard by the pandemic. Food inflation, which accounts for nearly half the CPI basket, rose 8.38% year-on-year in April, the highest in nearly two years. A more than 4% fall in the rupee against the dollar this year has also made imports costlier. That means interest rates are set to keep rising. After a surprise 40-basis-point hike at an unscheduled meeting in May, the RBI lifted its repo rate another 50 basis points to 4.90% on Wednesday and said inflation will likely remain above its 6% upper tolerance band until December this year. ""A lot of the current pressures are very much supply-side driven. There's really little that the RBI can do directly to stem any of this in the short run,"" said Miguel Chanco, chief emerging Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics."

1,Markets fall as traders hostage to global gloom,economy," Indian markets opened over 1% lower tracking a fall in global equities as investors remain concerned about the global economy while awaiting key data on US retail inflation. At 9.55 am, the benchmark Sensex was down 1.3% or 711 points to 54608 points while the Nifty was 1.24% or 205 points lower at 16274 points. This comes after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.94 percent, the S&P 500 lost 2.38 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.75 percent overnight. Among Asian shares, Nikkei was down 1.3%, Hang Seng was trading flat, Topix down 1%, Kospi down 1.3%, Jakarta fell 1.2%, and the Philippines lost 2%. ""Global markets are falling as investors remain concerned about the global economy while awaiting key data about inflation. The combination of slowing growth and rising prices has raised concerns of stagflation where growth stalls but inflation drives up prices. Moreover, the Russia-Ukraine crisis continues to impact market sentiments,"" said Mitul Shah, head of research at Reliance Securities. Here is a detailed look at the factors sending Indian markets lower: India data: Investors will wait for April factory output data today and consumer price index data for May on Monday. A Bloomberg poll expects factory output for April to rise 5% year on year from 1.9% a month ago and CPI to grow 7.1% for May versus 7.79% in April. US CPI data: Investors are waiting for US CPI inflation data for May today.   They expect the US Federal Reserve to hike rates by 50 basis points next week, especially if data confirms an elevated inflation reading. ECB meeting: The European Central Bank on Thursday confirmed its intention to hike interest rates for the first time since 2011 and downgraded its growth forecasts. ECB aims to raise key interest rate by 25 basis points at the July meeting and targets a further hike in the September meeting, saying the scale of that increment would depend on the evolving trajectory of the medium-term inflation outlook. It has also ended its bond buying stimulus. Crude oil: Currently trading over $120 bbl fuelled by intensifying geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and tightening by global central banks. As oil boils, India's current account deficit is likely to hit a three-year high of 1.8% or $43.81 billion in FY22, as against a surplus of 0.9% or $23.91 billion in FY21, according to India Ratings. RBI policy: Reserve Bank of India signalled more rate hikes to come in its inflation fight. On Wednesday, RBI raised the key interest rate for a second straight month and pledged to withdraw the pandemic-era accommodation as it steps up its fight to tame prices that have been running above its target band since the beginning of the year. In the latest move, the rate setting panel unanimously raised the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 4.90%."
2,Execution issues continue to dog India’s infrastructure ambitions,economy," The modernisation of the New Delhi Railway Station project was one of the showcase infrastructure projects that the government wanted to present before the 2024 elections, both as a model of the kind of aspirational infrastructure it aims for under its ambitious National Infrastructure Pipeline plan, as well as an example of its ‘new and improved’ Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model.

Unfortunately, that looks unlikely to happen. Getting the PPP model right proved more difficult than thought initially and it looks..."
3,"Despite recent hikes, home loan rates below pre-COVID level: Renu Sud Karnad, MD, HDFC",economy," Leading private sector banks have been quick to hike interest rates following the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) 50 basis points (bps) hike in repo rate. The country’s premier housing finance company HDFC Ltd too raised its prime lending rate on home loans by 50 bps on Thursday, making it the fourth increase in a month. With the cost of borrowing for both the home buyer and developer rising sharply, the question is whether it would push up property prices..."
4,The market see-sawed after MPC announcement. Why?,economy," Last month, the MPC surprised the markets by delivering an off-cycle rate-hike of 40 bps. The Nifty retaliated by correcting nearly 400 points in a single day, and around 1300 points within the next ten days. In contrast, this Wednesday, the RBI swam with the stream and delivered a 50 bps rate-hike in line with expectations. The markets still corrected though.

It is worth noting, however, that the knee-jerk reaction to the move was quite positive – Nifty rose by..."
5,"Tea exporters buoyed by robust demand, expect 225 million kg shipments in 2022",economy," Buoyed by the ""encouraging"" demand scenario in overseas markets, Indian tea exporters are hoping to ship out 220-225 million kg in 2022, and are keen on filling up the vacuum left by crisis-hit Sri Lanka, officials said. India exported 196.54 million kg of tea in 2021 worth Rs 5,311.15 crore. ""At present, India has extremely good export demand. Of course, this has been aided by the situation in Sri Lanka, Indian Tea Exporters Association Chairman Anshuman Kanoria told PTI. ""This year, we are hopeful to touch the 225 million-kg mark in terms of outward shipments of tea. The majority of the crop that is exported is of orthodox variety. Prices of this variety are up by around 10-20 per cent year-on-year depending on quality,"" he said. Given the demand scenario, the industry is expecting a 40-50 per cent increase in the tea export value over the next two-three years, Kanoria said. Shipments in the initial months of the current season starting from March are up 10-20 per cent, said Mohit Agarwal, Director of Asian Tea Company, one of the top five tea exporting entities in the country. He said the industry is facing some difficulties in getting containers for sanctions-hit Russia, but demand for the orthodox variety in Middle East countries is ""encouraging"". The industry is expecting to achieve the pre-Covid level export volume of 250 million kg next year, he said. ""The export market for Indian tea remains buoyant and we are optimistic of achieving at least 220 million kg of exports this year. The maximum residue levels (MRLs) issues in the domestic market do not have any impact on the export front. All international buyers test our consignments and have not registered any complaint,"" Agarwal, a member of ITEA, told PTI. MRLs are defined as the maximum concentration of pesticide residue likely to occur in food after the use of pesticides, according to good agricultural practice (GAP). ""A compilation of international laws would restrict usage of almost every pesticide, and there are huge discrepancies in laboratory results, with each stating that results are subject to +/- 50 per cent error margin. In such an environment, a lab failure is more of a legislative rejection rather than a reflection of safety,"" Kanoria said. The exporting community conducts stringent testing to ensure that all exported teas are compliant with norms of the importing country, he said. ""Producers are obliged by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to produce teas compliant with the country's food safety laws. Indian tea exports have been well accepted globally with less than 0.1 per cent of shipments having issues, if at all,"" the ITEA chief said. South India Tea Exporters Association Chairman Dipak Shah said the Tea Board has to be more proactive to ensure that all testing regarding pesticides in tea leaves must end at farm-gate levels. ""As the MRL issues crop up, we are getting queries from overseas buyers. We are assuring them that exporters are regularly testing consignments but we have not heard of any report about return of consignments,"" Shah told PTI. Speaking on the export scenario, he said the industry remains bullish on orthodox tea, and prices of high-end products of the variety are up by Rs 40-50 in the overseas market, as Sri Lanka grapples with an unprecedented economic crisis. ""Rationalising MRL laws remains an ongoing discussion and tea is one of the safest beverages in the world,"" the ITEA had said in a recent release. Tea Research Association chairman Prabhat Bezboruah had recently said the non-compliance of some teas is mainly due to the detection level of MRLs set for certain compounds, which the FSSAI has already revised upwards and notified through a draft notification on August 20, 2020. The TRA, a 111-year-old organisation that looks after the research and development needs of 75 per cent of Indian tea production, said it is reworking on integrated pest management protocols to ensure that members meet all aspects of FSSAI regulations."
6,Govt chalks out offshore wind bid timeline even as India’s power demand touches new high,economy," The ministries of power and new and renewable energy have chalked out a plan to bid out 37 gigawatts (GW) equivalent of offshore wind energy projects in the next eight years till 2029-30 amid India’s overall demand for electricity touching an all-time high on June 9. India’s power demand hit an all-time high of 210.8 gigawatts (GW) on June 9, driven by a spike in demand from households amid an ongoing heat wave and a pick-up in industrial demand. India runs the majority of its electricity units on coal and the constrained supply of fuel has widened the gap between demand and supply of power. To combat climate change and global warming, India has set an ambitious target of 500GW of renewable energy by 2030 at COP26. Of this 500GW, about 140GW is planned from wind energy. While India has a coastline of 7,600 km on three sides and has good prospects of harnessing offshore wind energy, there has not been much progress on this front and there are no operational offshore wind projects yet. “In an unprecedented move, the nation's electricity demand on 9th June 2022 clocked an all-time high of 210793 MW at 1500 hours. Adding on to the record-breaking streak, on 8th June 2022, the nation's energy consumption also clocked a historic 4712 MU,” Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy RK Singh said in a tweet. The minister held a meeting on transmission planning for offshore wind energy projects in India, where after a detailed review, a timeline for these bids was decided. In a separate statement, the minister said, the government will issue bids equivalent to a project capacity of 4 GW per year for a period of three years starting with the current fiscal 2022-23 for development off the coast of Tamil Nadu and Gujarat for sale of power through open access, captive use, bi-lateral and third party sale, and merchant sales. Subsequently, a project capacity of 5 GW will be bid out every year for a period of five years till 2029-30. “The project capacity of 8 GW bid out in the first two years beginning FY22-23 will also be able to avail of the benefits of green attributes like carbon credits,” the statement said. The statement said that during the meeting, transmission and evacuation infrastructure required for offshore wind projects of a total capacity of 10 GW off the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, was discussed. The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, through its implementing agency, will issue the first bid in the next three – four months, for leasing out offshore wind energy blocks equivalent to 4.0 GW capacity off the coast of Tamil Nadu. The evacuation and transmission of power from offshore pooling substation to onshore transmission will be provided free of cost for all offshore wind capacities that will be bid out up to FY 29-30."
7,"India, Iran get back to Chabahar port, INSTC route eyeing renewed Russia trade",economy," The Chabahar port in Iran and the transcontinental trade route that originates from that country, have received renewed interest from Iran and New Delhi, on increasing overland trade with Russia. The issue has been a core point of discussion during the visit of Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian to Delhi, officials said. A monitoring group for operational issues will soon be formed by officials of both nations to ease a series of issues at the Shahid Beheshti terminal at the Chabahar port in Iran. The terminal is one of two at Chabahar, Iran’s only ocean port. It has been developed by India, which formally took over operations in December 2018. It incorporates thousands of kilometres of all-weather highways from the city of Chabahar in the south, through Azerbaijan in the north, and onwards to Russia and Europe. Road to Russia The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions against Russia have led to an exodus of Western businesses from the country. India is keen on filling up the economic vacuum thus created. Multiple exporters have also begun discussions with Russian buyers and importers to supply retail and industrial goods. India's exports to Russia stood at $3.24 billion in 2021-22, up from the pre-pandemic figure of $3 billion. Meanwhile, imports from the country have risen to $9.86 billion, of which $5.25 billion was crude oil, processed petroleum and coal. Total imports had stood at $7 billion in 2019-20. “To ensure more overland trade with Russia, the INSTC is important. However, it is even more important in the light of Chinese traders too, rushing to enter the Russian market,” a senior Commerce Department official said. The route is also part of India’s overall efforts to establish greater connectivity and trade with the high-potential markets of the adjoining Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, officials say. ""This grouping of ex-Soviet nations spread across East Europe and Central Asia often have had tenuous relations with the West in the past, and have increasingly hiked their imports from China. After the Ukraine crisis, western penetration in the area is set to decrease further,” he added. Eight of the nine CIS nations are now part of the INSTC, along with Oman, Syria and Bulgaria. Exports to Central Asia stood at only $678 million, but New Delhi estimates the optimal trade potential to be at least eight-nine times this amount. Major exports to the region are pharmaceuticals, machinery, coffee, tea and spices. Countries in the region are considered underserved markets and are potential suppliers of energy and minerals to India. Challenges galore In 2016, India signed a deal with Iran promising an $8-billion investment in the port and industries in the Chabahar Special Economic Zone, including an aluminium smelter and a urea-making facility. But while the port has now emerged as a commercial transit hub for the region and especially Central Asia, the spate of financial sanctions against Iran by the United States has led to commerce suffering and Western companies unwilling to set up base on the premises. ""The United States had exempted the multinational project from its sanctions at India’s insistence back in November 2018, but the rest of the country is still under sanctions. This has stymied the natural growth of the port,"" a senior official said. The US decision had also partially been due to the port's economic importance to landlocked Afghanistan. In February 2019, Afghanistan launched a new export route to India through the port. The country had been an important node of the INSTC, and Kabul had been keen on the route as it provided the country an opening to global supply chains and trade networks while bypassing Pakistan."
8,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | How many more rate hikes? The guessing game is on,economy," Dear Reader, The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Today’s edition of Moneycontrol Pro has a bouquet of articles on the Monetary Policy Committee’s aggressive 50 basis-point rate hike that underscores the Reserve Bank of India’s efforts to tame rising inflation. The central bank’s focus to withdraw its accommodative stance and increase FY2023 inflation estimates by 100 basis points to 6.7 per cent raises several questions on what lies beyond. How many more rate hikes lie ahead? How much is sufficient to cool off inflation? Will this affect consumption? Will higher borrowing cost slow capital expenditure? RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said 75 per cent of increase in India’s inflation can be attributed to food and energy prices -- caused largely by factors outside monetary control. In his column, banking and financial markets expert Prof. Ananth Narayan points out how speedy rise in rates and withdrawal of banking liquidity might do little to alleviate inflation, while impacting investment and job creation. But what it could do is increase real rates for savers, who had shifted to riskier assets. While the spotlight is on rising rates, Manas Chakravarty writes here that the real repo rate (adjusted for retail inflation) is at around the same level as it was a year ago! Will the rate hike actually help rein in inflation, as expected? Then, there are concerns over economic growth arising from the higher borrowing costs that would add to prevailing high commodity prices. There’s no letting up in global crude prices – it’s at a 13-week high today, although commodity prices may soften slightly, given the easing of supply and logistics constraints, which are a fallout of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Read this piece, where Gaurav Kapur, chief economist, IndusInd Bank, points out that given the marginal growth in real terms seen in the last two years, any further frontloaded and aggressive monetary tightening may be unwarranted. However, RBI has retained its growth forecast at 7.2 per cent for the current year. Factors such as a normal monsoon, healthy corporate and bank balance sheets and improved capacity utilisation in March quarter, which is the highest since Q4FY2019, lend confidence. Indian financial markets are wobbly, perhaps due to uncertainty on what the outcome of rate hikes would be on growth and inflation in the coming quarters. Besides, a lot of the developments on home turf are influenced by global factors. Many economists believe the MPC is likely to raise rates by another 100 bps over the next four meetings for the current fiscal year, which will take the repo rate to 5.9 per cent by February 2023. On another note, the Indian start-up scene is also on edge as we have pointed out in our earlier columns. Today’s piece has a contrarian take for entrepreneurs - starting up in a downturn could make sense. Action-packed week ahead as central banks aim at soft landing CCL Products: Time for a sip?

9,Businesses should avoid aggressive short-term reward-seeking culture: RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das,economy," The Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das on Thursday said businesses should avoid having an aggressive short-term reward-seeking culture without considering the build-up of excessive risks in their balance sheets. Das said doing business involves risk taking. But before taking the risk, the upside and downside will have to be carefully considered. ""Businesses should avoid aggressive short-term reward-seeking culture without regard for the build-up of excessive risk in the balance sheet,"" Das said while delivering a speech at the Iconic Week celebrations, as part of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav', to mark the 75th anniversary of Independence. The event was organised by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) here. The common characteristics of some of the inappropriate business models or strategies that have come to the RBI's notice includes inappropriate funding structure, building asset liability mismatches, which are highly risky and not sustainable, he said. Besides, unrealistic strategic assumptions, particularly excessive optimism about capabilities, growth opportunities and market trends may lead to poor strategic decisions, he noted."
10,"Equity MFs continue to see positive momentum; Rs 18,529 crore inflow recorded in May",economy," Witnessing positive momentum for the 15th straight month, equity mutual funds attracted a net sum of Rs 18,529 crore in May amid heightened volatility in stock markets and consistent selling by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). This was much higher compared to a net inflow of Rs 15,890 crore in April, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) showed on Thursday. Equity schemes have been witnessing net inflow since March 2021, highlighting the positive sentiment among investors. Prior to this, such schemes had consistently witnessed outflows for eight months from July 2020 to February 2021 losing Rs 46,791 crore. All the equity-oriented categories received net inflows in May with flexi cap funds category being the biggest beneficiary with a net inflow of Rs 2,939 crore. Besides, large-cap, large & mid-cap fund and sectoral/thematic funds witnessed over Rs 2,200 crore net infusion each. ""Even with markets facing high volatility, uncertainty due to the Ukraine-Russia war, supply chain disruptions, high inflation and lower economic growth projections, investors are opting for equity mutual funds,"" Gopal Kavalireddi, Head of Research at FYERS, said. Inflow through SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) rose to Rs 12,286 crore in May from Rs 11,863 crore in April, indicating that retail investors continue to hold confidence on equity investments. This is the ninth consecutive month of SIP inflow being greater than Rs 10,000 crore, a trend which started in September 2021 with Rs.10,351 crore inflow. Apart from equity, gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) category saw an inflow of Rs 203 crore. On the other hand, the debt category saw a net outflow of Rs 32,722 crore in May after witnessing a net inflow of Rs 69,883 crore in the preceding month. Overall, the mutual fund industry registered a net withdrawal of Rs 7,532 crore last month as compared to a net inflow of Rs 72,846 crore in April. ""Mutual fund negative net flow is an outcome of the rising interest rate cycle, with investors redeeming their investments from money market and low to short-duration funds,"" he added."
11,"Climate Change | Indian cities need innovation, integrated climate action planning",economy," Rhea Srivastava Indian cities are rapidly becoming vulnerable to climate-related extreme weather events that are ultimately deteriorating the urban environment and citizens’ quality of life. For the past few months now most parts of North India have been grappling with a severe heatwave, with temperatures in New Delhi reaching 49 degree Celsius. At the same time, the Northeast was hit by flash floods and massive landslides, causing a number of deaths, disruption of essential infrastructure, and livelihood displacement. In 2020, extreme weather events such as floods, heavy rainfall, heatwaves, etc. killed about 2,000 people across India and bore an annual financial loss of about $87 billion. As clear indicators of Climate Change, these shocks affect key urban sectors, such as energy systems, water supply, and transport infrastructure. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its report has further warned that key infrastructure in many cities along India’s coastline is likely to get submerged by 2050 due to significant sea level rise, and inundation. The increasing frequency and intensity of such climate risks and impacts bring about a critical question at the forefront — are Indian cities prepared for Climate Change, and its looming impacts? Cities require a transformative approach to deal with Climate Change — one that comprises of a robust mix of adaptation (adjusting to/reducing the impact) and mitigation actions (addressing the cause, i.e. GHG emissions). Despite this, much of the focus for achieving climate resilience in Indian cities leans more towards climate mitigation. The present adaptation actions that are being implemented tend to be reactive and sectoral in nature. For example, disaster recovery efforts after multiple floods, or our focus on clean air specifically. These standalone interventions may not consider sectoral relationships, and feedback loops, thereby, exacerbating the long-term damage to other infrastructure, resources, and most importantly the vulnerable and marginalised groups of society. The need of the hour is to move beyond traditional patterns of urban development and planning, towards innovative and integrated climate action planning, where tackling Climate Change is not just seen as an add-on to the overall urban development strategy. Innovative multi-level governance and finance mechanisms that incorporate adaptation thinking into existing local planning processes can minimise trade-offs and create cross-sectoral synergies, especially when coupled with efficient mitigation interventions. Local leadership providing room for autonomous change has the potential to transform planning capacities, and address complex urban inequalities generated from the climate crisis. Some cities have recently started developing innovative ways to enhance their adaptive capacity. Mumbai, which came up with its own climate action plan setting a net-zero target for 2050, created a pathway to catalyse change in governance mechanisms across India. The city’s climate action plan takes a pragmatic approach towards climate resilience by keeping adaptation and mitigation activities well balanced, and giving priority to the local stakeholders. The action plan further talks about establishing a climate action cell in the city that will focus on the monitoring, evaluation, and reporting of the actions, including a feedback mechanism. Other cities such as Rajkot, Surat, and Udaipur have also prepared comprehensive city-level action plans for resilience. Nevertheless, weak institutional capacities including lack of context-specific expertise on adaptation planning and financial resource mobilisation are the common roadblocks for optimising adaptation policy action in majority of cities. Indian cities currently exhibit patterns of path dependency and lock-in, shaped by a blend of past and present choices. Many city governments to this date depend heavily on national and state governments for urban development and climate action policy implementation, as well as for financial support. In a number of cases, climate datasets necessary for adaptation and mitigation planning (e.g., risk assessments, are available at the national/state level, while Climate Change impacts manifest locally). Additionally, lack of co-ordination among government departments, both vertically — between local, state, and national levels — and horizontally across departments, further deteriorate local capacities. In an effort to tackle these challenges at the local level, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs launched the ‘Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework’ (CSCAF) as a tool for cities to assess their present climate preparedness. The framework, which assessed 126 cities on 28 climate indicators, essentially acts as a guiding framework for cities to become climate responsive by learning from best practices, monitoring their climate impacts, and making informed decisions for resource mobilisation. This initiative is a significant step towards mainstreaming integrated climate action using a bottom-up approach while generating numerous systemic co-benefits. In the long term, Climate Change along with rapid urbanisation and population growth will make integrated climate action planning a pre-requisite for cities. Revising the core fabric of urban development through multi-level governance, multi-stakeholder engagement, and building local capacities for informed and inclusive decision-making with respect to climate resilience are, therefore, instrumental for Indian cities in managing complex climate issues and achieving holistic climate action.

12,India considers curbing fridge imports to boost local industry: Sources,economy," India is considering restricting imports of refrigerators to promote local manufacturing, two industry sources told Reuters on Thursday, potentially freezing out shipments from Samsung Electronics Co and LG Electronics Inc in the $5 billion market. The sources, who declined to be named as the talks were private, said the government was considering mandating that importers seek a licence from the authorities, replacing the existing free-import regime. That could be followed by a ban on imports of refrigerators with refrigerant already added, to create opportunities for value-added operations in India, said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the government's discussions. The source said a decision could come within a month, adding: ""The thrust is to support all those who are manufacturing in India rather than those bringing them into India."" The Indian trade ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for Samsung and LG also did not respond immediately. A licensing regime, the other source said, would raise the compliance burden and risk delaying imports. The government estimates India's refrigerator market at more than $5 billion, with foreign companies such as Samsung and LG competing with domestic majors including the Tata conglomerate's Voltas Ltd. The first source said India's annual fridge-making capacity was around 24 million units but demand was only some 15 million, a part of which is met by imports. The government does not release figures for refrigerator imports, although the second source said companies such as Samsung and LG import thousands of high-end refrigerators annually. A third industry source said sales of large, high-end refrigerators, many of which are imported, have been growing rapidly, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic as people stayed indoors. Those imports account for roughly 5-6% of total India sales. The move is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Make in India"" programme to boost local manufacturing and discourage imports. India in 2020 banned the import of air conditioners with refrigerant already added. That same year it also placed restrictions on television imports, affecting Samsung and other global manufacturers. India imports refrigerators from countries with which it holds a free trade agreement, including Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea."
13,Crypto currencies yet to pass test of fiat currency: CEA Anantha Nageswaran,economy," Sounding a note of caution, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said on Thursday that the crypto currencies have yet to pass the test to become fiat currency and at the same time it would be difficult to regulate them. He further said that unlike fiat money, crypto currencies cannot satisfy basic requirements such as having store value, widespread acceptability and unit of account. Referring to decentralised finance (DeFI), he said: ""In my opinion, while it is considered innovation, I would reserve my judgement whether it is truly innovative or truly disruptive in a positive sense or is it something that we will come to regret."" Nageswaran said that he agreed with RBI Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar who had been saying that as of now there appeared to be a case of regulatory arbitrage with regard to crypto currencies and decentralised finance rather than a case of true financial innovation. As an alternative to fiat currencies, he said crypto currencies have ""to satisfy many purposes. It has to be a store of value, it has to have widespread acceptability and it has to be a unit of account...In all these cases the new 'innovations' such as crypto or DeFI are yet to pass the test."
14,FreshR raises USD 1.2 million in new funding round,economy," Fish and meat distribution startup FreshR has raised USD 1.2 million (Rs 9.33 crore) in a funding round led by Axilor Ventures and 1crowd, a release said on Thursday. FreshR would use the fresh funding to grow and expand its geographical footprint, develop and implement its tech stack as well as grow its team. ”Building India’s largest fish and meat distribution business – FreshR has recently announced that it has raised USD 1.2 million in funding led by Axilor Ventures and 1crowd,” the statement said. FreshR, founded by Ambika Satapathy and Sadananda Satapathy, had earlier raised a pre-seed round from Villgro, Upaya Social Ventures, Beyond Capital Fund and other early stage funders. ”The company also launched an application earlier this year which, is a one-of-a-kind resource used to standardise prices and grades for the sector and allows bulk buyers from across India to place orders and track quality processes,” the company statement said. Since its inception, FreshR has farmed, traded, processed and distributed highly-perishable meat products in some of the remotest geographies in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Commenting on the fundraise, Ambika Satapathy, co-founder of FreshR, said: ”Our vision is to organise the domestic market by using technology to cater to this fragmented demand and investing in world class infrastructure to manage pan-India sourcing and distribution.”"
15,"FM Sitharaman calls on public enterprises to show greater professionalism, efficiency",economy," Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has called on public sector enterprises (PSEs) to improve their professionalism and efficiencies as the government opens up nearly every area to the private sector. Speaking to heads of central PSEs in Gandhinagar as part of the finance ministry's week-long 'Iconic Week' celebrations, Sitharaman said the public sector must be ready to work and compete with the private sector. ""It is now time for PSEs to show that you are very keen to improve on your professionalism as much as you have done between 1991 and now. And where possible, in order to bring down the overheads, it might be worth looking at private participation together with what you are doing. There are several aspects where you can benefit from the efficiency of the private sector,"" the finance minister said. As per the new PSE policy announced in 2021, central public sector undertakings (PSU) will maintain a minimal presence in four strategic sectors—atomic energy, space and defence; transport and telecommunications; power, petroleum, coal and other minerals; and banking insurance and financial services. In other sectors, central PSUs will be privatised, merged, or considered for closure. According to Sitharaman, the new PSE policy means PSUs in these four strategic sectors must be thorough in their plans when it comes to scaling up and considering amalgamation or working with private companies. ""The moment you are opening up for the private sector to come in into an area, we in the public sector will have to be conscious of the level of competition which is going to be before us. And if we are conscious of the level of competition before us, I am sure - as you have done in the several decades past - you will face the challenge and will also be able to stand up and through better efficiencies be on the top rather than leave the space for efficiency to be elsewhere and your presence not being noticed,"" the minister said."
16,Rupee hits fresh low against dollar as FIIs continue selling,economy," Indian rupee on Friday hit a fresh record low against the dollar as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued selling in local equity markets. The currency opened at 77.75 and touched a fresh record low of 77.8075 a dollar. At 12.32pm, the domestic currency was trading at 77.80 a dollar, down 0.08% from its previous close. FIIs have sold $23 billion in domestic equities so far this year amid higher crude prices that continue to stoke worries about inflation and fiscal deficit. Analysts are awaiting the European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting due later today and the US Fed meeting next week. ECB is likely to announce the end of asset purchases and indicate the beginning of the rate hike cycle. Rate hikes are likely to commence from as early as July policy given record high inflation in Germany and Eurozone, analysts said. ""Intraday ranges have been extremely narrow as RBI has been intervening to prevent runaway Rupee depreciation. RBI's presence is deterring speculators from freely expressing a long USDINR view,"" said IFA Global in a note. The domestic currency was stable for the last two weeks due to weakness in the dollar amid concerns over global growth outlook. Further, RBI has continued to support the currency through foreign exchange sales. In fact, RBI’s forex reserves have fallen by $36.1 billion since the start of the year. ""Risks to the rupee outlook remain tilted to the downside. First, global commodity prices continue to remain elevated thus putting pressure on India’s external balance. Second, FII outflows have been persistent at $5.5 billion in May 22 and $23 billion in CYTD22. Third, domestic retail inflation has been tracking higher. Fourth, dimming growth prospects will also weigh on rupee,"" said Bank of Baroda in a note. On Wednesday, the RBI hiked the repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.90%, while leaving the cash reserve ratio (CRR) unchanged. For FY23, it raised its retail inflation projection from 5.7% year on year to 6.7%, while retaining GDP growth at 7.2%. According to analysts, over the next 12 months, RBI can be expected to hike policy rates by another 100-150 basis points to 6-6.5%."

Propelled on to the public market after merging with a special purpose acquisition company set up by former Hollywood executives, Ginkgo shares surged in the first few weeks of trading.

18,"Chief economic adviser echoes central bank: Crypto and DeFi are regulatory arbitrage, not financial innovation",economy," Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran has said crypto and decentralised financial instruments seem to be a case of regulatory arbitrage rather than financial innovation. ""Decentralised finance...I would reserve judgment on whether it is truly innovative, or truly disruptive in a positive sense, or is it something that we would come to regret,"" he said at the India International Fintech Festival hosted by The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India. ""Much of what is happening in the space of cryptos or decentralised finance – and I completely endorse what Rabi Sankar, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Deputy Governor, has been saying – as of now they do appear to be a case of regulatory arbitrage rather than a case of true financial innovation in my opinion."" Sankar has been critical of private cryptocurrencies over the last year or so and called for more scepticism when it comes to these technologies. While the RBI is adamant that private cryptocurrencies pose a threat to the financial system and would never be legal tender, New Delhi has started taxing transactions involving crypto and is expected to soon finalise a consultation paper on the subject. The government has refused to make public its stance on crypto before the release of the consultation paper. According to Nageswaran, crypto and decentralised finance have yet to pass the test to qualify as fiat currencies. Moreover, the absence of a regulator in the space has led to certain issues, with the government's top economist citing the case of Luna whose value dramatically crashed last month. ""I wouldn't be very excited by them because sometimes we may not be fully aware, we may not be able to fully comprehend the forces we are unleashing,"" Nageswaran said, adding that he wasn't sure if these kinds of ""innovations"" will continue to thrive as interest rates harden."
19,"Raghuram Rajan says economic achievements, not nationalism, must reunite India",economy," Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan has called for a ""bolder national reunification programme"" for India based on economic achievements rather than nationalism and identity politics. In an article co-authored with fellow economist Rohit Lamba, Rajan wrote that while the current Indian government had the right idea with its $5-trillion-economy target, it was unachievable even if the pandemic had not occurred. ""...we should rearticulate the slogan with some modifications; 'A ten trillion dollar inclusive and sustainable economy by 2035' is an ambitious goal (requiring about 8 percent growth a year in real terms) but achievable."" Rajan and Lamba wrote. Rajan is currently the Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at The University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Lamba is an economist at The Pennsylvania State University. The article (external link) also appeared in the Times of India newspaper on June 8. The article is the fifth in a series on why Rajan and Lamba think India's economic future can't be separated from its politics and sociology. The government's target of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2025 has taken a hit due to the coronavirus pandemic, with Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran saying in February that the achievement of the goal may be delayed by a couple of years. More recently, on June 8, Nageswaran said India could even become a $20-trillion economy by 2040. According to Rajan and Lamba, constitutionalism espoused by liberals may not offer a full answer to ""the demagogue who brings people into the streets by reciting a litany of historic wrongs to be righted"". As such, an economy-based national agenda was needed, such as one which targets making India into a sustainable and inclusive $10-trillion economy by 2035. ""To some, the pursuit of economic betterment is a low-level selfish goal. Yet it is a form of self-actualisation that offers our youth an attractive alternative to that of finding purpose in incendiary causes"" Rajan and Lamba wrote. The duo called on politicians to shout the target of making India a $10 trillion sustainable and inclusive economy by 2035 ""from every roof top"" and create a ""popular imagery"" around it such that it also becomes a cultural and political project. Further, states should also set their own goals along similar lines, with Tamil Nadu targeting to become a $1 trillion economy by 2030."
20,RBI consumer survey | Buyers look to cut down spending on non-essentials,economy," The Reserve Bank of India’s Consumer Confidence Survey, conducted in early May, shows that sentiment is improving among consumers as the economic recovery gathers steam.

The survey has a section on spending on non-essential items. The ‘one year ahead expectations’ give us a peek into the spending intentions of those surveyed on discretionary items. This could be a gauge of future demand for such items.

In May 2022, only 27.5 percent of respondents said that they will increase spending on discretionary..."

22,Capacity utilisation in March quarter highest since Q4 FY19,economy," The RBI governor, in his statement on monetary policy, said, ‘Going by the early results of our surveys, capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector increased further to 74.5 per cent in Q4:2021-22 from 72.4 per cent in Q3:2021-22. Capacity utilisation is also likely to increase further in 2022-23. Investment activity is thus expected to strengthen, driven by rising capacity utilisation, government’s capex push and deleveraged corporate balance sheets.’ The accompanying chart shows that the capacity utilisation in the..."
23,"Despite hike, real repo rate is around the same level as a year ago ",economy," Take a look at the accompanying chart, which shows the real repo rate in the last ten years. In spite of the Monetary Policy Committee raising the repo rate by 50 basis points to 4.9 percent on Wednesday, the fact is that the real repo rate, or the rate adjusted for retail inflation, is at around the same level as it was a year ago. From that perspective, therefore, there has hardly been any ‘withdrawal of accommodation’---monetary policy continues..."
